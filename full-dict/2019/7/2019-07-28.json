    "abstract": "In many sensory systems the neural signal is coded by the coordinated response of heterogeneous populations of neurons. What computational benefit does this diversity confer on information processing? We derive an efficient coding framework assuming that neurons have evolved to communicate signals optimally given natural stimulus statistics and metabolic constraints. Incorporating nonlinearities and realistic noise, we study optimal population coding of the same sensory variable using two measures: maximizing the mutual information between stimuli and responses, and minimizing the error incurred by the optimal linear decoder of responses. Our theory is applied to a commonly observed splitting of sensory neurons into ON and OFF that signal stimulus increases or decreases, and to populations of monotonically increasing responses of the same type, ON. Depending on the optimality measure, we make different predictions about how to optimally split a population into ON and OFF, and how to allocate the firing thresholds of individual neurons given realistic stimulus distributions and noise, which accord with certain biases observed experimentally.",

    "abstract": "The field of evidence synthesis is growing rapidly, with a corresponding increase in the number of software tools and workflows to support the construction of systematic reviews, systematic maps, and meta-analyses. Despite much progress, however, a number of problems remain including slow integration of new statistical or methodological approaches into user-friendly software, low prevalence of open-source software, and poor integration among distinct software tools. These issues hinder the utility and transparency of new methods to the research community. Here I present revtools, an R package to support article screening during evidence synthesis projects. It provides tools for the import and de-duplication of bibliographic data, screening of articles by title or abstract, and visualization of article content using topic models. The software is entirely open-source and combines command-line scripting for experienced programmers with custom-built user interfaces for casual users, with further methods to support article screening to be added over time. Revtools provides free access to novel methods in an open-source environment, and represents a valuable step in expanding the capacity of R to support evidence synthesis projects.",

    "abstract": "Symbiosis is a key driver of evolutionary novelty and ecological diversity, but our understanding of how macroevolutionary processes originate extant symbiotic associations is still very incomplete. Cophylogenetic tools are used to assess the congruence between the phylogenies of two groups of organisms related by extant associations. If phylogenetic congruence is higher than expected by chance, we conclude that there is cophylogenetic signal in the system under study. However, how to quantify cophylogenetic signal is still an open issue. We present a novel approach, Random Tanglegram Partitions (Random TaPas) that applies a given global-fit method to random partial tanglegrams of a fixed size to identify the associations, terminals and nodes that maximize phylogenetic congruence. By means of simulations, we show that the output value produced is inversely proportional to the number and proportion of cospeciation events employed to build simulated tanglegrams. In addition, with time-calibrated trees, Random TaPas is also efficient at distinguishing cospeciation from pseudocospeciation. Random TaPas can handle large tanglegrams in affordable computational time and incorporates phylogenetic uncertainty in the analyses. We demonstrate its application with two real examples: Passerine birds and their feather mites, and orchids and bee pollinators. In both systems, Random TaPas revealed low cophylogenetic signal, but mapping its variation onto the tanglegram pointed to two different coevolutionary processes. We suggest that the recursive partitioning of the tanglegram buffers the effect of phylogenetic nonindependence occurring in current global-fit methods and therefore Random TaPas is more reliable than regular global-fit methods to identify host-symbiont associations that contribute most to cophylogenetic signal. Random TaPas can be implemented in the public-domain statistical software R with scripts provided herein. A Users Guide is also available at GitHub.",

Here we provide evidence that involuntary swimming at early developmental stages can reconfigure the cortisol response to homotypic and heterotypic stress in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio), also reducing startle reactivity and increasing spontaneous activity as well as energy efficiency during active behaviour. Collectively, these data identify a role of the genetically malleable zebrafish for linking early life stress with glucocorticoid function in later life.",

    "abstract": "Most human tumors display chromosome-scale copy number alterations, and high levels of aneuploidy are frequently associated with advanced disease and poor patient prognosis. To examine the relationship between aneuploidy and cancer progression, we generated and analyzed a series of congenic human cell lines that harbor single extra chromosomes. We find that different aneuploidies can have distinct effects on invasive behavior: across 13 different cell lines, 12 trisomies suppressed invasiveness or were largely neutral, while a single trisomy increased metastatic behavior by triggering a partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In contrast, chromosomal instability, which can lead to the development of aneuploidy, uniformly suppressed cellular invasion. By analyzing genomic copy number and survival data from 10,133 cancer patients, we demonstrate that specific aneuploidies are associated with distinct clinical outcomes, and the acquisition of certain aneuploidies is in fact linked with a favorable prognosis. Thus, aneuploidy is not a uniform driver of malignancy, and different chromosome copy number changes can uniquely influence tumor progression. At the same time, the gain of a single chromosome is capable of inducing a profound cell state transition, underscoring how genomic plasticity can engender phenotypic plasticity and lead to the acquisition of enhanced metastatic properties.",

    "abstract": "Human-mediated transport creates secondary contacts between genetically differentiated lineages, bringing new opportunities for gene exchange. When similar introductions occur in different places, they provide informally replicated experiments for studying hybridisation. We here examined 4279 Mytilus mussels, sampled in Europe and genotyped with 77 ancestry informative markers. We identified a type of introduced mussels, called  dock mussels, associated with port habitats and displaying a particular genetic signal of admixture between M. edulis and the Mediterranean lineage of M. galloprovincialis. These mussels exhibit similarities in their ancestry compositions, regardless of the local native genetic backgrounds and the distance separating colonised ports. We observed fine-scale genetic shifts at the port entrance, at scales below natural dispersal distance. Such sharp clines do not fit with migration-selection tension zone models, and instead suggest habitat choice and early stage adaptation to the port environment, possibly coupled with connectivity barriers. Variations in the spread and admixture patterns of dock mussels seem to be influenced by the local native genetic backgrounds encountered. We next examined departures from the average admixture rate at different loci, and compared human-mediated admixture events, to naturally admixed populations and experimental crosses. When the same M. galloprovincialis background was involved, positive correlations in the departures of loci across locations were found; but when different backgrounds were involved, no or negative correlations were observed. While some observed positive correlations might be best explained by a shared history and saltatory colonisation, others are likely produced by parallel selective events. Altogether, genome-wide effect of admixture seems repeatable, and more dependent on genetic background than environmental context. Our results pave the way towards further genomic analyses of admixture, and monitoring of the spread of dock mussels both at large and fine spacial scales.",

    "abstract": "The impact of transient ischemic-hypoxemic insults on the developing fetal brain is poorly understood despite evidence suggesting an association with neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. To address this, we designed an aberrant uterine hypercontractility paradigm with oxytocin to better assess the consequences of acute, but transient, placental ischemia-hypoxemia in term pregnant rats. Using MRI imaging, we confirmed that oxytocin-induced aberrant uterine hypercontractility significantly compromised uteroplacental perfusion. This was supported by the observation of oxidative stress and increased lactate concentration in the fetal brain. Genes related to oxidative stress pathways were significantly upregulated in male, but not female, offspring 1 h after oxytocin-induced placental ischemia-hypoxemia. Persistent upregulation of select mitochondrial electron transport chain complex proteins in the anterior cingulate cortex of adolescent male offspring suggested that this sex-specific effect was enduring. Functionally, offspring exposed to oxytocin-induced uterine hypercontractility showed male-specific abnormalities in social behavior with associated region-specific changes in gene expression and functional cortical connectivity. Our findings, therefore, indicate that even transient but severe placental ischemia-hypoxemia could be detrimental to the developing brain and point to a possible mitochondrial link between intrauterine asphyxia and neurodevelopmental disorders.",

Although this process of myotube guidance is essential to pattern the musculoskeletal system, the mechanisms that control myotube guidance remain poorly understood. Using transcriptomics, we found that components of the Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signaling pathway were enriched in nascent myotubes in Drosophila embryos. Null mutations in the FGF receptor heartless (htl), or its ligands, caused significant myotube guidance defects. Mechanistically, paracrine FGF signals to Htl in the mesoderm regulate the activity of Rho/Rac GTPases in nascent myotubes to effect changes in the actin cytoskeleton. FGF signals are thus essential regulators of myotube guidance that act through cytoskeletal regulatory proteins to pattern the musculoskeletal system.",

To this end, following other models of cultural evolution, we explicitly consider the investments made by individuals in culture as life history decisions. Our aim is to understand what then determines the dynamics of cultural accumulation. We show that culture can accumulate provided it improves the efficiency of peoples lives in such a way as to increase their productivity or, said differently, provided the knowledge created by previous generations improves the ability of subsequent generations to invest in new knowledge. Our central message is that this positive feedback allowing cultural accumulation can occur for many different reasons. It can occur if cultural knowledge increases peoples productivity, including in domains that have no connection with knowledge, because it frees up time that people can then spend learning and/or innovating. We also show that it can occur if cultural knowledge, and thus the higher level of resources that results from increased productivity, leads individuals to modify their life history decisions through phenotypic plasticity. Finally, we show that it can occur if technical knowledge reduces the effective cost of its own acquisition via division of labour. These results suggest that culture should not be defined only as a set of knowledge and skills but, more generally, as all the capital that has been produced by previous generations and that continues to affect current generations.",

    "abstract": "Approaches based on molecular evolution have organized natural proteins into a hierarchy of families, superfamilies, and folds, which are often pictured as islands in a great sea of unrealized and generally non-functional polypeptides. In contrast, approaches based on information theory have substantiated a mostly random scatter of natural proteins in global sequence space. We evaluate these opposing views by analyzing fragments of a given length derived from either a natural dataset or different random models. For this, we compile distances in sequence space between fragments within each dataset and compare the resulting distance distributions between sets. Even for 100-mers, more than 95% of distances can be accounted for by a random sequence model that incorporates the natural amino acid frequency of proteins. When further accounting for the specific residue composition of the respective fragments, which would include biophysical constraints of protein folding, more than 99% of all distances can be modeled. Thus, while the local space surrounding a protein is almost entirely shaped by common descent, the global distribution of proteins in sequence space is close to random, only constrained by divergent evolution through the requirement that all intermediates connecting two forms in evolution must be functional.\n\nSignificance StatementWhen generating new proteins by evolution or design, can the entire sequence space be used, or do viable sequences mainly occur only in some areas of this space? As a result of divergent evolution, natural proteins mostly form families that occupy local areas of sequence space, suggesting the latter. Theoretical work however indicates that these local areas are highly diffuse and do not dramatically affect the statistics of sequence distribution, such that natural proteins can be considered to effectively cover global space randomly, though extremely sparsely. By comparing the distance distribution of natural sequences to that of various random models, we find that they are indeed distributed largely randomly, provided that the amino acid composition of natural proteins is respected.",

RNA-Seq analysis reveals that disrupted alleles are less frequent in the transcriptome than the native ones.",

For these reason it fascinates physicists, yet the multitude of different cells, molecules and sub-systems is often also petrifying. Despite this complexity, as experiments on different scales of the adaptive immune system become more quantitative, many physicists have made both theoretical and experimental contributions that help predict the behaviour of ensembles of cells and molecules that participate in an immune response. Here we review some recent contributions with an emphasis on quantitative questions and methodologies.

However, the complete list of eukaryotic RBPs including human is still unavailable. In this study, we systematically identified RBPs in 162 eukaryotic species based on both computational analysis of RNA binding domains (RBDs) and large-scale RNA binding proteomic (RBPome) data, and established a comprehensive eukaryotic RBP database, EuRBPDB (http://EuRBPDB.syshospital.org:8081). We identified a total of 311,571 RBPs with RBDs and 3,639 non-canonical RBPs without known RBDs. EuRBPDB provides detailed annotations for each RBP, including basic information and functional annotation. Moreover, we systematically investigated RBPs in the context of cancer biology based on published literatures and large-scale omics data. To facilitate the exploration of the clinical relevance of RBPs, we additionally designed a cancer web interface to systematically and interactively display the biological features of RBPs in various types of cancers. EuRBPDB has a user-friendly web interface with browse and search functions, as well as data downloading function. We expect that EuRBPDB will be a widely-used resource and platform for the RNA biology community.",

    "abstract": "Type I interferon (IFN) induced by virus infections during pregnancy causes placental damage, though the mechanisms and identities of IFN-stimulated genes that are involved remain under investigation. The IFN-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) inhibit virus infections by preventing virus membrane fusion with cells and by inhibiting fusion of infected cells (syncytialization). Fusion of placental trophoblasts via expression of endogenous retroviral fusogens known as Syncytins forms the syncytiotrophoblast, a multinucleated cell structure essential for fetal development. We found that IFN blocks fusion of BeWo human placental trophoblasts. Stably-expressed IFITMs 1, 2, and 3 also blocked fusion of these trophoblasts, while making them more resistant to virus infections. Conversely, stable knockdown of IFITMs in BeWo trophoblasts increased their spontaneous fusion and allowed fusion in the presence of IFN, while also making the cells more susceptible to virus infection. Overall, our data demonstrate that IFITMs are anti-viral and anti-fusogenic in trophoblasts.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous environmental microorganism that is also a common cause of nosocomial infections that vary in severity from chronic wound infections to pneumonia, bloodstream infections and sepsis. Its ability to survive in many different environments and persistently colonize human tissue is linked to its presence within biofilms that form on indwelling device surfaces such as plastics and stainless steel. Biofilm promotes bacterial adhesion and survival on surfaces, reduces susceptibility to desiccation, and the actions of antibiotics and disinfectants. Recent genome sequencing studies demonstrate that P. aeruginosa is a highly diverse species with a very large pan-genome consistent with its adaptability to differing environments. However, most MDR infections are caused by a small number of \\\"high-risk\\\" clones or lineages that recently emerged and spread globally.\\n\\nIn our 2017 study of the resistome of P. aeruginosa we confirmed the power of genome-wide association (GWAS) techniques to explore the genetic basis of several antibiotic resistance phenotypes and discovered 46 novel putative resistance polymorphisms. In this study we sought to examine genetic associations within a subset of these isolates with simple biofilm phenotypes. We examined the genetic basis for biofilm production on polystyrene at room temperature (22{degrees}C) and body temperature (37{degrees}C) within a total of 280 isolates. 69% of isolates (n=193) produced more biofilm mass at 22{degrees}C, whilst those producing more biofilm at 37{degrees}C had reduced optical density 540 variation. We found statistically significant associations with IpxO and other genes associated with arsenic resistance to be significantly associated with this trait. IpxO which encodes a lipid A hydroxylase and arsenic reduction genes have previously been found to be associated with biofilm production in this species. We analyzed 260 ST111 and ST235 genomes and found considerable genetic variation between isolates in their content of genes previously found associated with biofilm production. This is indicative of a highly variable and flexible population within these clades with frequent emergence of successful sub-lineages. Analysis of 48 of these isolates ability to form biofilm on stainless steel surfaces showed that a  good biofilm-forming phenotype had significant intra-clone variation, independent of core genome phylogeny with pan-genome analysis, suggesting a possible association and involvement of components of the type IV secretion system. However, GWAS and pan-GWAS analyses yielded weaker statistical significance. This study confirms GWAS and pan-GWAS trait associations can be performed for biofilm phenotype and produce data in agreement with each other. This panel of 280 study isolates, matched to genomic data has potential for the investigation of other phenotypes in P. aeruginosa perhaps as part of a growing database / collection. A representative, curated, genome sequenced collection should increase in usefulness as it grows offering increasing statistical power.\\n\\nImportanceP. aeruginosa is a major cause of multiply antibiotic infections worldwide but it is also found in many hospital and natural environments, especially aquatic ones. In this study we examined genetic polymorphism associated with biofilm production at room temperature and at body temperature, the biofilm associated gene repertoire of two major MDR clones and also genetic polymorphisms associated with biofilm production on stainless steel. Using these genome-wide and pan-genome wide association methods we identified / confirmed potential key genes involved in biofilm production and survival of P. aeruginosa. The study demonstrates the potential usefulness of large, genome sequenced isolate collections such as ours, to better understand the genetics underlying phenotypic diversity in this species.",

We showcase the use of EDA to optimize regulatory DNA sequences to bind to the transcription factor SPI1. Compared to other state-of-the-art approaches such as a textual variational autoencoder and rule-based editing, EDA significantly improves predicted binding of SPI1 of genomic sequences with the minimal set of edits. We also use EDA to design regulatory elements with optimized grammars of CREB1 binding sites that can tune reporter expression levels as measured by massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA). We analyze the properties of the binding sites in the edited sequences and find patterns that are consistent with previously reported grammatical rules which tie gene expression to CRE binding site density, spacing and affinity.",

    "abstract": "Drug repositioning aims to find new indications for existing drugs, in order to reduce drug development cost and time. Currently, numerous successful stories of drug repositioning have been reported and many drugs are already available on the market. Although many of those cases are products of serendipitous findings, repositioning opportunities can be uncovered systematically by following either a disease-centric approach, as a result of a close relation between an old and new indication, a target-centric one, which links a known target and its established drug to a new indication, or a drug-centric approach, which connects a known drug to a new target and its associated indication. The three approaches differ in their complexity, potential, and limits, and most important the necessary starting information and computational power. Which one is predominant in current drug repositioning and what does this imply for future developments? To address these questions, we systematically evaluated over 100 drugs, 200 targets structures and over 300 indications from the Drug Repositioning Database. Each of the analysed cases has been classified based on one of the three repositioning approaches, showing that the majority, more than 60%, falls within the disease-centric definition, around 30% within the target-centric, and only less than 10% within the drug-centric. We therefore concluded that so far repositioning has mainly been disease and target repositioning and not, as drug repositioning, as expected by definition. We discuss the reasons and suggest directions to exploit the full potential of techniques useful for drug-centric in order to sustain future rationale repositioning pipelines.",

    "abstract": "Humans engagement in music rests on underlying elements such as the listeners cultural background and general interest in music, all shaping the way music is processed in the brain and perceived. Crucially, these factors modulate how listeners anticipate musical events, a process inducing instantaneous neural responses as the music confronts these expectations. Measuring such neural correlates would represent a direct window into high-level brain processing of music. Here we recorded electroencephalographic and electrocorticographic brain responses as participants listened to Bach melodies. We assessed the relative contributions of the acoustic versus melodic components of the music to the neural signal. Acoustic features included envelope and its derivative. Melodic features included information on melodic progressions (pitch) and their tempo (onsets), which were extracted from a Markov model predicting the next note based on a corpus of Western music and the preceding proximal musical context. We related the music to brain activity with a linear temporal response function, and demonstrated that cortical responses to music encode melodic expectations. Specifically, individual-subject neural signals were better predicted by a combination of acoustic and melodic expectation features than by either alone. This effect was most pronounced at response latencies up to 350ms, and in both planum temporale and Heschls gyrus. Finally, expectations of pitch and onset-time of musical notes exerted independent cortical effects, and such influences were modulated by the listeners musical expertise. Overall, this study demonstrates how the interplay of experimental and theoretical approaches can yield novel insights into the cortical encoding of melodic expectations.",

    "abstract": "We studied actin filament polymerization and nucleation with molecular dynamics simulations and a previously established coarse-grained model having each residue represented by a single interaction site located at the C atom. We approximate each actin protein as a fully or partially rigid unit to identify the equilibrium structural ensemble of interprotein complexes. Monomers in the F-actin configuration bound to both barbed and pointed ends of a short F-actin filament at the anticipated locations for polymerization. Binding at both ends occurred with similar affinity. Contacts between residues of the incoming subunit and the short filament were consistent with expectation from models based on crystallography, X-ray diffraction and cryo-electron microscopy. Binding at the barbed and pointed end also occurred at an angle with respect to the polymerizable bound structure, and the angle range depended on the flexibility of the D-loop. Additional barbed end bound states were seen when the incoming subunit was in the G-actin form. Consistent with an activation barrier for pointed end polymerization, G-actin did not bind at an F-actin pointed end. In all cases, binding at the barbed end also occurred in a configuration similar to the antiparallel (lower) dimer. Individual monomers bound each other in a short-pitch helix complex in addition to other configurations, with several of them apparently non-productive for polymerization. Simulations with multiple monomers in the F-actin form show assembly into filaments as well as transient aggregates at the barbed end. We discuss the implications of these observations on the kinetic pathway of actin filament nucleation and polymerization and possibilities for future improvements of the coarse-grained model.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEControl of actin filament nucleation and elongation has crucial importance to cellular life. We show that coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations are a powerful tool which can gauge involved mechanisms at reasonable computational cost, while retaining essential features of the fully atomic, yet less computationally tractable, system. Using a knowledge-based potential demonstrates the power of these methods for explaining and reproducing polymerization. Intermediate actin complexes identified in the simulations may play critical roles in the kinetic pathways of actin polymerization which may have been difficult to observe in prior experiments. These methods have been sparsely applied to the actin system, yet have potential to answer many important questions in the field.",

    "abstract": "As developmental biologists in the age of genome editing, we now have access to an ever-increasing array of tools to manipulate endogenous gene expression. The auxin-inducible degradation system, allows for spatial and temporal control of protein degradation, functioning through the activity of a hormone-inducible Arabidopsis F-box protein, transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR1). In the presence of auxin, TIR1 serves as a substrate recognition component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex SKP1-CUL1-F-box (SCF), ubiquitinating auxin-inducible degron (AID)-tagged proteins for proteasomal degradation. Here, we optimize the Caenorhabditis elegans AID method, utilizing 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), an indole-free synthetic analog of the natural auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). We take advantage of the photostability of NAA to demonstrate via quantitative high-resolution microscopy that rapid degradation of target proteins can be detected in single cells within 30 minutes of exposure. Additionally, we show that NAA works robustly in both standard growth media and physiological buffer. We also demonstrate that K-NAA, the water-soluble, potassium salt of NAA, can be combined with microfluidics for targeted protein degradation in C. elegans larvae. We provide insight into how the AID system functions in C. elegans by determining that TIR1 interacts with C. elegans SKR-1/2, CUL-1, and RBX-1 to degrade target proteins. Finally, we present highly penetrant defects from NAA-mediated degradation of the Ftz-F1 nuclear hormone receptor, NHR-25, during C. elegans uterine-vulval development.

Several features characterizing CFSs have been associated with their instability, however, these features are prevalent across the genome and do not account for all known CFSs. Therefore, the molecular mechanism underlying CFS instability remains unclear. Here, we explored the transcriptional profile and temporal order of DNA replication (replication timing, RT) of cells under replication stress conditions. We show that the RT of only a small portion of the genome is affected by replication stress, and that CFSs are enriched for delayed RT. We identified a signature for chromosomal fragility, comprised of replication stress-induced delay in RT of early/mid S-phase replicating regions within actively transcribed large genes. This fragility signature enabled precise mapping of the core fragility region. Furthermore, the signature enabled the identification of novel fragile sites that were not detected cytogenetically, highlighting the improved sensitivity of our approach for identifying fragile sites. Altogether, this study reveals a link between altered DNA replication and transcription of large genes underlying the mechanism of CFS expression. Thus, investigating the RT and transcriptional changes in cancer may contribute to the understanding of mechanisms promoting genomic instability in cancer.",

The laws underlying this expansion and subsequent tumor eradication remain unknown. Still, about 60% of CAR T-treated patients are likely to progress; their tumors are not eradicated. Here we seek to understand and disentangle the multiple processes that contribute to CAR expansion and tumor eradication. We developed a mathematical model of T cell-tumor cell interactions, and demonstrate that CAR T cell expansion is shaped by immune reconstitution dynamics after lymphodepletion and predator prey-like dynamics. Our cell population model was parameterized using patient population-level data over time and recapitulates progression free survival. As an intrinsic property, we find that tumor eradication is a stochastic event. Our cell population-based approach renders CAR T cell therapy as an ecological dynamic process that drives tumors toward an extinction vortex. Even if a clinical event, such as progression, is likely, its timing can be highly variable. We predict how clinical interventions that increase CAR T memory populations could improve the likelihood of tumor eradication and improve progression free survival. Our model can be leveraged to propose new CAR composition and dosing strategies, assess the need for multiple doses, and identify patient populations most likely to benefit from CAR T with or without additional interventions.",

    "abstract": "Dogs are often commensal with human settlements. In areas where settlements are adjacent to wildlife habitat, the management of dogs can affect risk of spillover of disease to wildlife. We assess dog husbandry practices, and measure the prevalence of Canine Distemper Virus (CDV) in dogs, in 10 villages in Nepals Annapurna Conservation Area (ACA), an important region for Himalayan wildlife. A high proportion (58%) of owned dogs were allowed by their owners to roam freely, and many village dogs originated from urban areas outside the region. CDV antibodies, indicating past exposure, were detected in 70% of dogs, and 13% were positive for P-gene, suggesting current circulation of CDV. This is the first detection of canine distemper virus in a National Park in Nepal Himalaya. Dogs were generally in good condition, and none exhibited clinical signs of CDV infection, which suggests that infections were asymptomatic. CDV exposure varied with village location and age of dogs, but this variation was minor, consistent with high rates of movement of dogs across the region maintaining high seroprevalence. Residents reported the occurrence of several species of wild carnivores in or close to villages. These results suggest a high potential for transmission of CDV from village dogs to wild carnivores in ACA. We suggest that control of dog immigration, along with vaccination and neutering of dogs could mitigate the risk of CDV spillover into wild carnivore populations.",

    "abstract": "Over 400 million people are estimated to be at risk of acquiring dengue virus (DENV). Despite efforts to mitigate the impact of DENV epidemics, the virus remains a public health problem in the Americas: more than one million DENV cases were reported in the continent between January and July 2019 DENV was first detected in Brazil in 1982, and Brazil has reported 88% (1,127,244 cases) of all DENV cases in the Americas during 2019 to date. Sao Paulo state in the southeast of Brazil has reported nearly half of all DENV infections in the country. Here we characterised the genetic diversity of DENV strains circulating in Sao Paulo state in 2019, at the epicentre of the ongoing DENV epidemic. Using portable nanopore sequencing we generated 20 new DENV genome sequences from viremic patients with suspected dengue infection residing in two of the most-affected municipalities, Araraquara and Sao Jose do Rio Preto. We conducted a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis with 1,630 global DENV strains to better understand the evolutionary history of the DENV lineages that currently circulate in the region. The new outbreak strains were classified as DENV2 genotype III (American/Asian genotype). Notably, phylogenetic analysis indicated that the 2019 outbreak is the result of a novel DENV lineage that was recently introduced to Brazil from the Caribbean region. Our genetic analysis further indicates that the introduction and onwards spread of the outbreak lineage (named here DENV2-III BR-4) indicates a new DENV2 lineage replacement in Brazil. Dating phylogeographic analysis suggests that DENV2-III BR-4 was introduced to Brazil in or around early 2014, possibly from the Caribbean region. Our study describes the early detection of a newly introduced and rapidly-expanding DENV2 virus lineage in Brazil.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryDengue is the most important mosquito-borne viral disease of humans. The disease is caused by the dengue virus (DENV) that is classified within genus Flavivirus. DENV infections are caused by 4 serotypes (DENV 1-4) that are genetically related but antigenically distinct. Dengue infection results in a variety of symptoms that range from mild fever to dengue hemorrhagic fever and/or dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). Clinical outcomes are associated with different types of infection, viral serotypes, genotypes, lineages, and host genetic factors. As a re-emerging infectious disease, DENV has become a serious threat to public health in the Americas, and particularly in Brazil, where it was introduced in the 1980s and became well established due to the country-wide re-infestation of the Aedes aegypti mosquito vector species. During the first six months of 2019, 1,282,183 DENV cases were reported in the Americas, with Brazil reporting a staggering 1,127,244 (88%) of all dengue cases in the continent. To date, no information exists on the genetic composition of the DENV lineage or lineages causing the current epidemic. Here we use portable sequencing to rapidly generate virus genome data from cases occurring in two different are severely-affected municipalities in Sao Paulo state, Brazil. We find that the 2019 dengue outbreak in Brazil is caused by a newly introduced DENV serotype 2 genotype III (Asian/American) that seems to be replacing previously-circulating DENV2 lineages. We discuss the potential implications of our results regarding the current outbreak in the context of previous outbreaks in the same region.",

    "abstract": "Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) internalization can occur both by endocytosis and direct translocation through the cell membrane. These different entry routes suggest that molecular partners at the plasma membrane, phospholipids or glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), bind CPPs with different affinity or selectivity. The analysis of sequence-dependent interactions of CPPs with lipids and GAGs should lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying their internalization. CPPs are short sequences generally containing a high number of basic arginines and lysines and sometimes aromatic residues, in particular tryptophans. Tryptophans are crucial residues in membrane-active peptides, because they are important for membrane interaction. Membrane-active peptides often present facial amphiphilicity, which also promote the interaction with lipid bilayers. To study the role of Trp and facial amphiphilicity in cell interaction and penetration of CPPs, a nonapeptide series containing only Arg, Trp or D-Trp residues at different positions was designed. Our quantitative study indicates that to maintain/increase the uptake efficiency, Arg can be advantageously replaced by Trp in the nonapeptides. The presence of Trp in oligoarginines increases the uptake in cells expressing GAGs at their surface, when it only compensates for the loss of Arg and maintains similar peptide uptake in GAG-deficient cells. In addition, we show that facial amphiphilicity is not required for efficient uptake of these nonapeptides. Thermodynamic analyses point towards a key role of Trp that highly contributes to the binding enthalpy of complexes formation. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis highlights that salt bridge-{pi} interactions play a crucial role for the GAG-dependent entry mechanisms.",

There is an urgent need to develop novel strategies to enhance survival and improve patient prognosis. microRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in the regulation of cancer development and progression. In this study, we demonstrate that low expression of miR-15a is associated with poor prognosis of PDAC patients. miR-15a expression is reduced in PDAC while closely related miR-16 expression remains relatively unchanged. miR-15a suppresses several important targets such as Wee1, Chk1, Yap-1, and BMI-1 causing cell cycle arrest and inhibiting cell proliferation. Ectopic expression of miR-15a sensitizes PDAC cells to gemcitabine reducing the IC50 over 6.5-fold. To investigate the therapeutic potential of miR-15a, we used a modified miR-15a (5-FU-miR-15a) with uracil (U) residues in the guide strand replaced with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). We demonstrated enhanced inhibition of PDAC cell proliferation by 5-FU-miR-15a compared to native miR-15a. In vivo we showed the therapeutic power of 5-FU-miR-15a alone or in combination with gemcitabine with near complete elimination of PDAC lung metastatic tumor growth. These results support the future development of 5-FU-miR-15a as a novel therapeutic agent as well as a prognostic biomarker in the clinical management of PDAC.",

To this end, we compared two established CEnC culture methods by assessing the transcriptomic changes that occur during in vitro expansion. In confluent monolayers, low mitogenic culture conditions preserved corneal endothelial cell state identity better than culture in high mitogenic conditions. Expansion by continuous passaging induced replicative cell senescence. Transcriptomic analysis of the senescent phenotype identified a cell senescence signature distinct for CEnC. We identified activation of both classic and new cell signaling pathways that may be targeted to prevent senescence, a significant barrier to realizing the potential clinical utility of in vitro expansion.",

    "abstract": "Insulin has long served as a model for protein aggregation, both because of the importance of aggregation in insulin manufacture and because the structural biology of insulin has been extensively characterized. Despite intensive study, details about the initial triggers for aggregation have remained elusive at the molecular level. We show here that at acidic pH, the aggregation of insulin is likely initiated by a partially folded monomeric intermediate whose concentration is controlled by an off-pathway micellar species. High resolution structures of the partially folded intermediate show that it is coarsely similar to the initial monomeric structure but differs in subtle details - the A chain helices on the receptor interface are more disordered and the B chain helix moves away from C-terminal A chain helix. The result of these movements is the creation of a hydrophobic cavity in the center of the protein that may serve as nucleation site for oligomer formation. Knowledge of this transition may aid in the engineering of insulin variants that retain the favorable pharamacokinetic properties of monomeric insulin but are more resistant to aggregation.",

The great diversity of homologous sequences hides, in many cases, a variety of functional activities that cannot be anticipated. Their identification appears critical for a fundamental understanding of living organisms and for biotechnological applications.\n\nProfileView is a sequence-based computational method, designed to functionally classify sets of homologous sequences. It relies on two main ideas: the use of multiple probabilistic models whose construction explores evolutionary information in available databases, and a new definition of a representation space where to look at sequences from the point of view of probabilistic models combined together. ProfileView classifies families of proteins for which functions should be discovered or characterised within known groups.\n\nWe validate ProfileView on seven classes of widespread proteins, involved in the interaction with nucleic acids, amino acids and small molecules, and in a large variety of functions and enzymatic reactions. ProfileView agrees with the large set of functional data collected for these proteins from the literature regarding the organisation into functional subgroups and residues that characterize the functions. Furthermore, ProfileView resolves undefined functional classifications and extracts the molecular determinants underlying protein functional diversity, showing its potential to select sequences towards accurate experimental design and discovery of new biological functions.\n\nProfileView proves to outperform three functional classification approaches, CUPP, PANTHER, and a recently developed neural network approach based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines.

    "abstract": "Pore forming toxins (PFTs) are a class of proteins which have specifically evolved to form unregulated pores in target plasma membranes, and represent the single largest class of bacterial virulence factors. With increasingly prevalent antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains, next generation therapies are being developed to target bacterial PFTs rather than the pathogens themselves. However, structure-based design of inhibitors that could block pore formation are hampered by a paucity of structural information about pore intermediates. On similar lines, observations of the inter-subunit interfaces in fully-formed pore complexes to identify druggable residues, whose interactions could potentially be blocked to hamper pore formation or destabilize pore assemblies, are often limited because of the presence of a large number of protein-protein interaction sites across pore inter-subunit interfaces. Narrowing down the list of plausible target residues requires a quantitative assessment of their contributions towards pore stability, which cannot be gleaned from a single, static, crystal or cryo-EM pore structure. We overcome this limitation by developing an in silico screening algorithm that employs fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations coupled with knowledge-based screening to identify residues engaged in persistent and stabilizing electrostatic interactions across inter-subunit interfaces in membrane-inserted PFT pores. Application of this algorithm to prototypical -PFT (cytolysin A) and {beta}-PFT (-hemolysin) pores yielded a small predicted subset of highly interacting residues, blocking of which could destabilize pore complexes as shown in previous mutagenesis experiments for some of these predicted residues. The algorithm also yielded a novel set of residues in both cytolysin A and -hemolysin pores for which no mutagenesis and stability data exists to the best of our knowledge, and therefore could serve as hitherto un-recognised potential targets for PFT inhibitors. The algorithm worked equally well for both  and {beta}-PFT pores, and could thus be potentially applicable to all pores with known structures to generate a database of pore-destabilizing mutations, which could then serve as a starting point for experimental validation and structure-based PFT-inhibitor design.",

Here we address this obstacle by presenting a methodology that enables Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) of bacterial microcolonies. By combining optimized sample preparation with sub-atmospheric pressure MALDI, we demonstrate that chemical output from groups of as few as ~50 cells can be visualized with MALDI-IMS. Application of this methodology to Bacillus subtilis and Streptomyces coelicolor revealed heterogeneity in chemical output across microcolonies, and asymmetrical metabolite production when cells grew within physiological gradients produced by Medicago sativa roots. Taken together, these results indicate that MALDI-IMS can readily visualize metabolites made by very small assemblages of bacterial cells, and that even these small groups of cells can differentially produce metabolites in response to local chemical gradients.",

Interaction with VP30 via the R26xxS29 motif recruits SRPK1 into EBOV-induced inclusion bodies, the sites of viral RNA synthesis and an inhibitor of SRPK1/SRPK2 downregulates primary viral transcription. When the SRPK1 recognition motif of VP30 was mutated in a recombinant EBOV, virus replication was severely impaired. It is presumed that the interplay between SRPK1 and PP2A in the EBOV inclusions provides a comprehensive regulatory circuit to ensure the activity of VP30 in EBOV transcription.",

    "abstract": "RationaleChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of mortality in the United States. Electronic health records provide large-scale healthcare data for clinical research, but have been underutilized in COPD research due to challenges identifying these individuals, especially in the absence of pulmonary function testing data.\\n\\nObjectivesTo develop an algorithm to electronically phenotype individuals with COPD at a large tertiary care center.\\n\\nMethodsWe identified individuals over 45 years of age at last clinic visit within Vanderbilt University Medical Center electronic health records. We tested phenotyping algorithms using combinations of both structured and unstructured text and examined the clinical characteristics of the resulting case sets.\\n\\nMeasurement and Main ResultsA simple algorithm consisting of 3 International Classification of Disease codes for COPD achieved a sensitivity of 97.6%, a specificity of 76.0%, a positive predictive value of 57.1%, and a negative predictive value of 99.0%. A more complex algorithm consisting of both billing codes and a mention of oxygen on the problem list that achieved a positive predictive value of 86.5%. However, the association of known risk factors with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was consistent in both algorithm sets, suggesting a simple code-only algorithm may suffice for many research applications.\\n\\nConclusionsSimple code-only phenotyping algorithms for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can identify case populations with epidemiologic and genetic profiles consistent with published literature. Implementation of this phenotyping algorithm will expand opportunities for clinical research and pragmatic trials for COPD.",

    "abstract": "Recent efforts to understand the natural niche of the keystone model organism Caenorhabditis elegans have suggested that this species is cosmopolitan and associated with rotting vegetation and fruits. However, most of the strains isolated from nature have low genetic diversity likely because recent chromosome-scale selective sweeps contain alleles that increase fitness in human-associated habitats. Strains from the Hawaii Islands are highly divergent from non-Hawaiian strains. This result suggests that Hawaiian strains might contain ancestral genetic diversity that was purged from most non-Hawaiian strains by the selective sweeps. To characterize the genetic diversity and niche of Hawaiian C. elegans, we sampled across the Hawaiian Islands and isolated 100 new C. elegans strains. We found that C. elegans strains are not associated with any one substrate but are found in cooler climates at high elevations. These Hawaiian strains are highly diverged compared to the rest of the global population. Admixture analysis identified 11 global populations, four of which are from Hawaii. Surprisingly, one of the Hawaiian populations shares recent ancestry with non-Hawaiian populations, including portions of globally swept haplotypes. This discovery provides the first evidence of gene flow between Hawaiian and non-Hawaiian populations. Most importantly, the high levels of diversity observed in Hawaiian strains might represent the complex patterns of ancestral genetic diversity in the C. elegans species before human influence.",

Immune gene misregulation occurs in FSHD muscle biopsies with DUX4 targets enriched for inflammatory processes. However, assessment of the FSHD immune cell transcriptome, and the evaluation of DUX4 and target gene expression has not yet been performed. We show that FSHD lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) display robust DUX4 expression, and express early and late DUX4 targets. Moreover, genes elevated on FSHD LCLs are elevated in FSHD muscle biopsies, correlating with DUX4 target activation and histological inflammation.

That these cDNAs do indeed code for authentic neuroparsins was confirmed by in situ hybridization in the wax moth, Galleria mellonella, which labeled the neuroparsin neuroendocrine cells. Although in virtually all genome assemblies from Lepidoptera a neuroparsin gene could be identified, the genome assembly from the silkworm, Bombyx mori, has a neuroparsin gene containing a 16 nucleotide deletion that renders this gene nonfunctional. Although only a small number of all silkworm strains carry this deletion, it suggests that the domestication of the silkworm has rendered the function of this neurohormone dispensable.",

    "abstract": "A dysfunctional response to inhaled pathogens and toxins drives a substantial portion of the susceptibility to acute and chronic lung disease in the elderly. We used transcriptomic profiling combined with genetic lineage tracing, heterochronic adoptive transfer, parabiosis and treatment with metformin to show that the lung microenvironment defines the phenotype of long-lived alveolar macrophages during aging. While tissue-resident alveolar macrophages persist in the lung without input from monocytes over the lifespan, severe lung injury results in their replacement with monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages. These monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages are also shaped by the microenvironment both during aging and in response to a subsequent environmental challenge to become transcriptionally and functionally similar to tissue-resident alveolar macrophages. These findings show that changes in alveolar macrophage phenotypes during injury and aging are not cell autonomous but instead are shaped by changes in the aging lung microenvironment.",

    "abstract": "Termite mounds have recently been confirmed to mitigate approximately half of termite methane (CH4) emissions, but the aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria (methanotrophs) responsible for this consumption have not been resolved. Here we describe the abundance, composition, and kinetics of the methanotroph communities in the mounds of three distinct termite species. We show that methanotrophs are rare members of the termite mound biosphere and have a comparable abundance, but distinct composition, to those of adjoining soil samples. Across all mounds, the most abundant and prevalent particulate methane monooxygenase sequences detected were affiliated with Upland Soil Cluster  (USC), with sequences homologous to Methylocystis and Tropical Upland Soil Cluster also detected. The Michaelis-Menten kinetics of CH4 oxidation in mounds were estimated from in situ reaction rates. The apparent CH4 affinities of the communities were in the low micromolar range, which is one to two orders of magnitude higher than those of upland soils, but significantly lower than those measured in soils with a large CH4 source such as landfill-cover soils. The rate constant of CH4 oxidation, as well as the porosity of the mound material, were significantly positively correlated with the abundance of methanotroph communities of termite mounds. We conclude that termite-derived CH4 emissions have selected for unique methanotroph communities that are kinetically adapted to elevated CH4 concentrations. However, factors other than substrate concentration appear to limit methanotroph abundance and hence these bacteria only partially mitigate termite-derived CH4 emissions. Our results also highlight the predominant role of USC in an environment with elevated CH4 concentrations and suggest a higher functional diversity within this group than previously recognised.",

Yet many factors defining why one protein is active while its homolog is inactive remain uncertain. For pseudoenzyme-enzyme pairs, the similarity of both subunits can often hinder conventional characterization approaches. In plants, a pseudoenzyme PDX1.2 positively regulates vitamin B6 production by association with its active catalytic homologs such as PDX1.3 through an unknown mechanism. Here we used an integrative experimental approach to learn that such pseudoenzyme-enzyme pair associations result in hetero-complexes of variable stoichiometry, which are unexpectedly tunable. We also present the atomic structure of the PDX1.2 pseudoenzyme as well as the population averaged PDX1.2-PDX1.3 pseudoenzyme-enzyme pair. Finally, we dissected hetero-dodecamers of each stoichiometry to understand the arrangement of monomers in the hetero-complexes and identified symmetry- imposed preferences in PDX1.2-PDX1.3 interactions.

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are the main source of ATP production and also contribute to many other processes central to cellular function. Mitochondrial activities have been linked with growth, differentiation and aging. As relicts of bacterial endosymbionts, these organelles contain their own genetic system (i.e., mitogenome or mtDNA). The expression of the mtDNA in plants is complex, particularly at the posttranscriptional level. Following transcription, the polycistronic pre-RNAs in plant mitochondria are processed into individual RNAs, which then undergo extensive modifications, as trimming, splicing and C[-&gt;]U editing, before being translated by organellar ribosomes. Our study focuses on N6-methylation of Adenosine ribonucleotides (m6A-RNA) in plant mitochondria. m6A is the most common modification in eukaryotic mRNAs. The biological significance of this highly dynamic modification is under investigation, but its widely accepted that m6A mediates structural switches that affect RNA stability and activity. By performing m6A-pulldown/RNA-seq (m6A-RIP-seq) analyses of Arabidopsis and cauliflower mitochondrial transcripts (mtRNAs), we provide with detail information on the m6A landscapes in angiosperms mitochondria. The results indicate that m6A targets different types of mtRNAs, including coding sequences, UTRs, introns and non-coding RNA species. While introns and noncoding-RNAs undergo multiple m6A modifications along the transcript, in mRNAs m6A-modifications are preferably positioned near start-codons, and may modulate the translatability of the m6A-modified transcripts.",

    "abstract": "Recent phylogenetic studies of gekkonid lizards have revealed unexpected, widespread paraphyly and polyphyly among genera, unclear generic boundaries, and a tendency towards the nesting of taxa exhibiting specialized, apomorphic morphologies within geographically widespread \\\"generalist\\\" clades. This is especially true in the Australasia, where the monophyly of Gekko proper has been questioned with respect to phenotypically ornate flap-legged geckos of the genus Luperosaurus, the Philippine false geckos of the genus Pseudogekko, and even the elaborately \\\"derived\\\" parachute geckos of the genus Ptychozoon. Here we employ sequence capture targeting 5060 ultraconserved elements to infer phylogenomic relationships among 42 representative ingroup gekkonine lizard taxa. We analyzed multiple datasets of varying degrees of completeness (10, 50, 75, 95, and 100 percent complete with 4715, 4051, 3376, 2366, and 772 UCEs, respectively) using concatenated maximum likelihood and multispecies coalescent methods. Our sampling scheme was designed to address four persistent systematic questions in this group: (1) Are Luperosaurus and Ptychozoon monophyletic and are any of these named species truly nested within Gekko? (2) Are prior phylogenetic estimates of Sulawesis L. iskandari as sister to Melanesian G. vittatus supported by our genome-scale dataset? (3) Is the high elevation L. gulat of Palawan Island correctly placed within Gekko? (4) And, finally, where do the enigmatic taxa P. rhacophorus and L. browni fall in a higher-level gekkonid phylogeny? We resolve these issues; confirm with strong support some previously inferred findings (placement of Ptychozoon taxa within Gekko; the sister relationship between L. iskandari and G. vittatus); resolve the systematic position of unplaced taxa (L. gulat, and L. browni); and transfer L. iskandari, L. gulat, L. browni, and all members of the genus Ptychozoon to the genus Gekko. Our unexpected and novel systematic inference of the placement of Ptychozoon rhacophorus suggests that this species is not related to Ptychozoon or even Luperosaurus (as previously expected) but may, in fact, be most closely related to several Indochinese species of Gekko. With our final, well-supported topologies, we recognize seven newly defined subgenera to accommodate [~]60 species within the more broadly defined and maximally-inclusive Australasian genus Gekko. The newly defined subgenera will aide taxonomists and systematists in species descriptions by allowing them to only diagnose putatively new species from the most relevant members of the same subgenus, not necessarily the phenotypically variable genus Gekko as a whole, and we argue that it appropriately recognizes geographically circumscribed units (e.g., a new subgenus for a novel clade, entirely endemic to the Philippines) while simultaneously recognizing several of the most systematically controversial, phenotypically distinct, and phylogenetically unique lineages. An added benefit of recognizing the most inclusive definition of Gekko, containing multiple phylogenetically-defined subgenera, is that this practice has the potential to alleviate taxonomic vandalism, if widely adopted, by creating formally available, supraspecific taxa, accompanied by character-based diagnoses and properly assigned type species, such that future, more atomized classifications would necessarily be required to adopt todays subgenera as tomorrows genera under the guidelines of The Code of Zoological Nomenclature. Not only does this simple practice effectively eliminate the nefarious motivation behind taxonomic vandalism, but it also ensures that supraspecific names are created only when accompanied by data, that they are coined with reference to a phylogenetic estimate, and that they explicitly involve appropriate specifiers in the form of type species and, ultimately, type specimens.",

    "abstract": "The PAF complex (PAFC) coordinates transcription elongation and mRNA processing events and its CDC73/parafibromin subunit functions as a tumour suppressor. The NF2/Merlin tumour suppressor functions at the cell cortex and nucleus and is a key mediator of contact inhibition. Here we provide a direct link between nuclear Merlin and transcription elongation controlled by cell-cell adhesion. Merlin interacts with the PAFC in a cell density-dependent manner and tumour-derived inactivating mutations in both Merlin and CDC73 mutually disrupt their interaction. Growth suppression by Merlin requires CDC73 and Merlin regulates PAFC association with chromatin in a subset of genes. We also identify by CDC73 affinity-proteomics a role for FAT cadherins in regulating the Merlin-PAFC interaction. Our results suggest that in addition to its function within the Hippo pathway, nuclear Merlin is part of a tumour suppressor network which coordinates postinitiation steps of the transcription cycle of genes mediating in contact inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Although polyploidy, or whole-genome duplication, is widespread across the Plant Tree of Life, its long-term evolutionary significance is still poorly understood. Here we examine the effects of polyploidy in driving macroevolutionary patterns within the angiosperm family Brassicaceae, a speciose clade exhibiting extensive inter-specific variation in chromosome numbers. We inferred ploidal levels from haploid chromosome numbers for 80% of species in the most comprehensive species-level chronogram for the Brassicaceae published to date. After evaluating a total of 54 phylogenetic models of diversification, we found that ploidy drives diversification rates across the Brassicaceae, with polyploids experiencing faster rates of speciation and extinction, but relatively slower rates of diversification. Nevertheless, diversification rates are, on average, positive for both polyploids and diploids. We also found that despite diversifying significantly slower than diploids, polyploids have played a significant role in driving present-day differences in species richness among clades. Overall, although most polyploids go extinct before sustainable populations are established, rare successful polyploids persist and significantly contribute to the long-term evolution of lineages. Our findings suggest that polyploidy has played a major role in shaping the long-term evolution of the Brassicaceae and highlight the importance of polyploidy in shaping present-day diversity patterns across the plant Tree of Life.\\n\\nSignificance statementAlthough polyploidy is a source of innovation, its long-term evolutionary significance is still debated.

    "abstract": "Ecological speciation occurs when reproductive isolation evolves as a byproduct of adaptive divergence between populations. However, it is unknown whether divergent ecological selection on gene regulation can directly cause reproductive isolation. Selection favoring regulatory divergence between species could result in gene misregulation in F1 hybrids and ultimately lower hybrid fitness. We combined 58 resequenced genomes with 124 transcriptomes to test this hypothesis in a young, sympatric radiation of Cyprinodon pupfishes endemic to San Salvador Island, Bahamas, which consists of a dietary generalist and two novel trophic specialists - a molluscivore and a scale-eater. We found more differential gene expression between closely related sympatric specialists than between allopatric generalist populations separated by 1000 km. Intriguingly, 9.6% of genes that were differentially expressed between sympatric species were also misregulated in their F1 hybrids. Consistent with divergent ecological selection causing misregulation, a subset of these genes were in highly differentiated genomic regions and enriched for functions important for trophic specialization, including head, muscle, and brain development. These regions also included genes that showed evidence of hard selective sweeps and were significantly associated with oral jaw length - the most rapidly diversifying skeletal trait in this radiation. Our results indicate that divergent ecological selection in sympatry can cause hybrid gene misregulation which may act as a primary reproductive barrier between nascent species.\\n\\nSignificanceIt is unknown whether the same genes that regulate ecological traits can simultaneously contribute to reproductive barriers between species. We measured gene expression in two trophic specialist species of Cyprinodon pupfishes that rapidly diverged from a generalist ancestor. We found genes differentially expressed between species that also showed extreme expression levels in their hybrid offspring. Many of these genes showed signs of selection and have putative effects on the development of traits that are important for ecological specialization. This suggests that genetic variants contributing to adaptive trait divergence between parental species negatively interact to cause hybrid gene misregulation, potentially producing unfit hybrids. Such loci may be important barriers to gene flow during the early stages of speciation, even in sympatry.",

At a similar price-point, these approaches produce vastly different assemblies, with linked-read assemblies having overall higher quality, measured by larger N50 values and greater gene content.

Participants were equally divided among European, African, Hispanic, and mixed race/ethnicities. We evaluated the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics medically actionable list of 59 genes focusing on the cardiac genes. Variation was interpreted using the most recent reports in ClinVar, a database of medically relevant human variation. We identified 19 individuals with pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in cardiac actionable genes (2%) and found evidence for clinical correlates in the electronic health record. African ancestry participants had more variants of uncertain significance in the medically actionable genes including the 30 cardiac actionable genes, even when normalized to total variant count per person. Longitudinal measures of left ventricle size, corrected for body surface area, from approximately 400 biobank participants (1,723 patient years) correlated with genetic findings. The presence of one or more uncertain variants in the actionable cardiac genes and a cardiomyopathy diagnosis correlated with increased left ventricular internal diameter in diastole and in systole.

    "abstract": "Imprinted genes with parental-biased expression are hypothesized to result from an evolutionary conflict between the parental genomes over procurement of maternal resources. Accordingly, imprinted genes are enriched in pathways regulating nutrient acquisition, energy homeostasis, and growth. Here, we functionally characterize a large cluster of maternally-expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) to explore why they evolved imprinted expression in neurons. Using an induced neuron (iN) culture system, we show maternally-expressed miRNAs from the miR-379/410 cluster repress paternally-expressed genes, including known regulators of energy homeostasis Plagl1 and Peg3. Additional non-imprinted metabolic regulators are also co-targeted by miR-379/410. Maternal deletion of this imprinted miRNA cluster results in de-repression of its targets and up-regulation of a broader gene program regulating feeding behavior and synaptic transmission. These data suggest non-coding RNAs actively engage in parental genomic conflict, whereby maternally-expressed miRNAs antagonize paternally-driven gene programs in neurons.",

    "abstract": "The establishment of a method that would overexpress or suppress of specific microRNA activity is essential for the functional analysis of these molecules and for the development of miRNA therapeutic applications. There already exist excellent ways to inhibit miRNA function in vitro and in vivo by overexpressing miRNA target sequences, which include miRNA  decoys,  sponges, or  antagomirs that are complementary to an miRNA seed region. Conversely, no methods to induce stable gain-of-function phenotypes for specific miRNAs have, as yet, been reported. Furthermore, the discovery of complementary miRNA pairs raises suspicion regarding the existing methods used for miRNA overexpression. In our study, we will study whether the traditional methods for miRNA overexpression can be used for specific miRNA overexpression while complementary miRNA pairs exist. In addition, we test various miRNA-expression cassettes that were designed to efficiently overexpress specific miRNA through the shRNA lentivirus expression system. We report the optimal conditions that were established for the design of such miRNA-expression cassettes. We finally demonstrate that the miRNA-expression cassettes achieve efficient and long-term overexpression of specific miRNAs. Meanwhile, our results also support the notion that miRNA-miRNA interactions are implicated in potential, mutual regulatory patterns and beyond the seed sequence of miRNA, extensive pairing interactions between a miRNA and its target also lead to target-directed miRNA degradation. Our results indicate that our method offers a simple and efficient means to over-express the specific miRNA with long-term which will be very useful for future studies in miRNA biology, as well as contributed to the development of miRNA-based therapy for clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Climate change and pollution are some of the greatest anthropogenic threats to wild animals. Transgenerational plasticity - when parental exposure to environmental stress leads to changes in offspring phenotype - has been recently highlighted as a potential mechanism to respond to various environmental and anthropogenic changes across taxa. Transgenerational effects may be mediated via multiple mechanisms, such as transfer of maternal hormones to eggs/fetus. However, sources of variation in hormone transfer are poorly understood in fish, and thus the first step is to characterize whether environmental challenges alter transfer of maternal hormones to eggs. To this end, we explored the genetic and environmental variation (in response to temperature and endocrine disrupting copper) in maternal thyroid hormone (TH), transfer to offspring in a common fish model species, the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) using multiple approaches: (i) We compared ovarian TH levels among six populations across a wide geographical range in the Baltic Sea, including two populations at high water temperature areas (discharge water areas of nuclear power plants) and we experimentally exposed fish to (ii) environmentally relevant heat stress and (iii) copper for 7 days. We found that populations did not differ in intraovarian TH levels, and short-term heat stress did not influence intraovarian TH levels. However, copper exposure increased both T4 and T3 levels in ovaries. The next step would be to evaluate if such alterations would lead to changes in offspring phenotype.\n\nCapsule: We show that experimental copper exposure, but not heat stress (experimental or among-population variation), leads to elevated ovarian thyroid hormone levels in sticklebacks.",

    "abstract": "Oat ranks sixth in world cereal production and has a higher content of health-promoting compounds compared to other cereals. However, there is neither a robust oat reference genome nor transcriptome. Using deeply sequenced full-length mRNA libraries of oat cultivar Ogle-C, a de novo high-quality and comprehensive oat seed transcriptome was assembled. With this reference transcriptome and QuantSeq 3 mRNA sequencing, gene expression was quantified during seed development from 22 diverse lines across six time points. Transcript expression showed higher correlations between adjacent time points. Based on differentially expressed genes, we identified 22 major temporal co-expression (TCoE) patterns of gene expression and revealed enriched gene ontology biological processes. Within each TCoE set, highly correlated transcripts, putatively commonly affected by genetic background, were clustered, and termed genetic co-expression (GCoE) sets. 17 of the 22 TCoE sets had GCoE sets with median heritabilities higher than 0.50, and these heritability estimates were much higher than that estimated from permutation analysis, with no divergence observed in cluster sizes between permutation and non-permutation analyses. Linear regression between 634 metabolites from mature seeds and the PC1 score of each of the GCoE sets showed significantly lower p-values than permutation analysis. Temporal expression patterns of oat avenanthramides and lipid biosynthetic genes were concordant with previous studies of avenanthramide biosynthetic enzyme activity and lipid accumulation. This study expands our understanding of physiological processes that occur during oat seed maturation and provides plant breeders the means to change oat seed composition through targeted manipulation of key pathways.",

    "abstract": "Whether ecosystems recover from disturbance depends on the presence of alternative stable states, which are theoretically possible in simple models of many systems. However, definitive empirical evidence for this phenomenon remains limited to demographically closed ecosystems such as lakes. In more interconnected systems such as temperate rocky reefs, the local relevance of alternative stable states might erode as immigration overwhelms local feedbacks and produces a single stable state. At larger spatial scales, dispersal might counter localized disturbance and feedbacks to synchronize states throughout a region. Here, we quantify how interconnectedness affects the relevance of alternative stable states using dynamical models of California rocky reef communities that incorporate observed environmental stochasticity and feedback loops in kelp-urchin-predator interactions. Our models demonstrate the potential for localized alternative states despite high interconnectedness likely due to feedbacks affecting dispersers as they settle into local communities. Regionally, such feedbacks affecting settlement can produce a mosaic of alternative stable states that span local (10-20km) scales despite the synchronizing effect of long-distance dispersal. The specific spatial scale and duration of each state predominantly depend on the scales of environmental variation and on local dynamics (here, fishing). Model predictions reflect observed scales of community states in California rocky reefs and suggest how alternative states co-occur in the wide array of marine and terrestrial systems with settlement feedbacks.",

Overall, human footprint had a high negative impact on geneflow in tigers, followed by leopards, sloth bears and the least on jungle cats. Individual landscape variables- land-use, human population density, density of linear features and roads- impacted the study species differently. Although land-use was found to be an important variable explaining genetic connectivity for all four species, the amount of variation explained, the optimum spatial resolution and the resistance offered by different land-use classes varied.\\n\\nMain conclusionsAs expected from theory, but rarely demonstrated using empirical data, the pattern of spatial autocorrelation of genetic variation scaled with dispersal ability and density of the study species. Landscape genetic analyses revealed species-specific impact of landscape features and provided insights into interactions between species biology and landscape structure. Our results emphasize the need for incorporating functional connectivity data from multiple species for landscape-level conservation planning.",

    "abstract": "Childhood maltreatment is highly prevalent and serves as a risk factor for mental and physical disorders. Self-reported childhood maltreatment appears heritable, but the specific genetic influences on this phenotype are largely unknown. The aims of this study were to 1) identify genetic variation associated with reported childhood maltreatment, 2) calculate the relevant SNP-based heritability estimates, and 3) quantify the genetic overlap of reported childhood maltreatment with mental and physical health-related phenotypes. Genome-wide association analysis for childhood maltreatment was undertaken, using a discovery sample from the UK Biobank (UKBB) (n=124,000) and a replication sample from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium-posttraumatic stress disorder working group (PGC-PTSD) (n=26,290). Heritability estimations for childhood maltreatment and genetic correlations with mental/physical health traits were calculated using linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSR). Two genome-wide significant loci associated with childhood maltreatment, located on chromosomes 3p13 (rs142346759, beta=0.015, p=4.35x10-8, FOXP1) and 7q31.1 (rs10262462, beta=-0.016, p=3.24x10-8, FOXP2), were identified in the discovery dataset but were not replicated in the PGC-PTSD sample. SNP-based heritability for childhood maltreatment was estimated to be [~]6%. Childhood maltreatment was most significantly genetically correlated with depressive symptoms (rg=0.70, p=4.65x10-40). This is the first large-scale genetic study to identify specific variants associated with self-reported childhood maltreatment. FOXP genes could influence traits such as depression and thereby be relevant to childhood maltreatment. Alternatively, these variants may be associated with a greater likelihood of reporting maltreatment. A clearer understanding of the genetic relationships of childhood maltreatment, including particular abuse subtypes, with various psychiatric disorders, may ultimately be useful in in developing targeted treatment and prevention strategies.",

    "abstract": "Wild pedigrees are critical for better understanding mating systems and inbreeding scenarios to inform conservation strategies for endangered species. To delineate pedigrees in wild populations, many identified individuals will have to be genotyped at thousands of loci, mostly from non-invasive samples. This requires us to quantify (a) the most common non-invasive sample available from identified individuals (b) the ability to acquire genome-wide data from such samples, and (c) the quality of such genome-wide data, and its ability to reconstruct relationships between animals within a population. We followed identified individuals from a wild endangered tiger population, and found that shed hair samples were most common compared to fecal samples, carcasses and opportunistic invasive samples. DNA extraction, library preparation and whole genome sequencing resulted in between 126,129 and 512,689 SNPs from across the genome for four such samples. Exploratory population genetic analyses revealed that these data were free of holistic biases, and could recover expected population structure and relatedness. Mitochondrial genomes recovered matrilineages as suggested by long-term monitoring data. Even with these few samples, we were able to uncover the matrilineage for an individual with unknown ancestry. In summary, we demonstrated that non-invasive shed hair samples yielded adequate quality/quantity DNA AND in conjunction with sensitive library preparation methods, provided reliable data from hundreds of thousands of SNPs across the genome. This makes shed hair are an effective resource for studying individual-based genetics of elusive endangered species.",

Flagellin, the primary component of bacterial flagella, is recognized by membrane TLR5 and cytoplasmic NLRC4 receptors, which promote a vigorous pro-inflammatory response typically associated with bacterial infection. However, herein, we report that the nature of the flagellin-induced response is highly dependent on the physiological state of the tissue. Specifically, in the steady state, epithelial cell detection of flagellin orchestrates an anti-inflammatory response mediated by IL-33-dependent type 2 regulatory T cells while, in the context of injury, it induces a pro-inflammatory response mediated by myeloid cells, IL-18 and Th17 cells. Likewise, in the absence of infection, bacterial symbionts expressing high levels of flagellin induce a type 2 response. These data demonstrate that, depending on the inflammatory state of the milieu, MAMPs can function both as immunogens or tolerogens.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial shape is physically determined by the peptidoglycan cell wall. The cell-wall-synthesis machinery responsible for rod shape in Escherichia coli is the processive  Rod complex. Previously, cytoplasmic MreB filaments were thought to govern formation and localization of Rod complexes based on local cell-envelope curvature. However, using single-particle tracking of the transpeptidase PBP2, we found strong evidence that PBP2 initiates new Rod complexes by binding to a substrate different from MreB or any known Rod-complex component. This substrate is likely the cell wall. Consistently, we found only weak correlations between MreB and envelope curvature in the cylindrical part of cells. Residual correlations do not require any curvature-based Rod-complex initiation but can be attributed to persistent rotational motion. Therefore, local cell-wall architecture likely provides the cue for PBP2 binding and subsequent Rod-complex initiation. We also found that PBP2 has a limiting role for Rod-complex activity, thus supporting its central role.",

Despite its broad use, little is known about the empirical variability inherently present in the scores of the ADOS scale, or their appropriateness to define change, to repeatedly use this test to characterize neurodevelopmental trajectories. Here we examine the empirical distributions of research-grade ADOS scores from 1,324 records in a cross-section of the population comprising participants with autism between 5-65 years of age. We find that these empirical distributions violate the theoretical requirements of normality and homogeneous variance, essential for independence between bias and sensitivity. Further, we assess a subset of 52 typical controls vs. those with autism and find lack of proper elements to characterize neurodevelopmental trajectories in a coping nervous system changing at non-uniform, non-linear rates. Lastly, longitudinally repeating the assessments over 4 visits in a subset of the participants with autism for whom verbal criteria kept the same appropriate ADOS modules over the timespan of the 4 visits, reveals that switching the clinician, changes the cutoff scores, and consequently, influences the diagnosis, despite maintaining fidelity in the same tests modules, room conditions and tasks fluidity per visit. Given the changes in probability distribution shape and dispersion of these ADOS scores, the lack of appropriate metric spaces, and the impact that these elements have on sensitivity-bias co-dependencies, and on longitudinal tracking of autism, we invite a discussion on the use of this test for scientific purposes.",

    "abstract": "Individual variation in the addiction liability of amphetamines has a heritable genetic component. We previously identified Hnrnph1 (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1) as a quantitative trait gene underlying decreased methamphetamine-induced locomotor activity in mice. Here, mice (both male and female) with a heterozygous mutation in the first coding exon of Hnrnph1 (H1+/-) showed reduced methamphetamine reinforcement and intake and dose-dependent changes in methamphetamine reward as measured via conditioned place preference. Furthermore, H1+/- mice showed a robust decrease in methamphetamine-induced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens with no change in baseline extracellular dopamine, striatal whole tissue dopamine, dopamine transporter protein, or dopamine uptake. Immunohistochemical and immunoblot staining of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and their forebrain projections for tyrosine hydroxylase did not reveal any major changes in staining intensity, cell number, or in the number of forebrain puncta. Surprisingly, there was a two-fold increase in hnRNP H protein in the striatal synaptosome of H1+/- mice with no change in whole tissue levels. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms linking increased synaptic hnRNP H with decreased methamphetamine-induced dopamine release and behaviors, synaptosomal proteomic analysis identified an increased baseline abundance of several mitochondrial complex I and V proteins that rapidly decreased at 30 min post-methamphetamine administration in H1+/- mice. In contrast, the much lower level of basal synaptosomal mitochondrial proteins in wild-type mice showed a rapid increase in response to methamphetamine. We conclude that H1+/- decreases methamphetamine-induced dopamine release, reward, and reinforcement and induces dynamic changes in basal and methamphetamine-induced synaptic mitochondrial function.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTMethamphetamine dependence is a significant public health concern with no FDA-approved treatment. We discovered a role for the RNA binding protein hnRNP H in methamphetamine reward and reinforcement. Hnrnph1 mutation also blunted methamphetamine-induced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens - a key neurochemical event contributing to methamphetamine addiction liability. Finally, Hnrnph1 mutants showed a marked increase in basal level of synaptosomal hnRNP H and mitochondrial proteins that decreased in response to methamphetamine whereas wild-type mice showed a methamphetamine-induced increase in synaptosomal mitochondrial proteins. Thus, we identified a potential role for hnRNP H in basal and dynamic mitochondrial function that informs methamphetamine-induced cellular adaptations associated with reduced addiction liability.",

First, the fish were exposed for 10 days to different metal concentrations. Accumulated metals were quantified and showed a positive dose dependent uptake for cadmium and copper, but not for zinc. Toxicity was in the order Cd>Cu>Zn with 96h LC50 values (concentration where 50% of the animals dies within 96h) for Cd at 0.20{+/-}0.16 M, Cu at 0.77{+/-}0.03 M, and Zn at 29.89{+/-}9.03 M respectively, and incipient lethal levels (concentration where 50% of the animals survives indefinitely) at 0.16 M, 0.77 M and 28.33 M respectively. Subsequently, a subacute exposure experiment was conducted, where carp juveniles were exposed to 2 equitoxic concentrations (10% and 50% of LC50 96 h) of the three metals. The gill metal content was quantified after 1, 3 and 7 days, and was correlated to electrolyte levels and structural damage of the gill tissue and associated pathological effects. Again a significant dose-dependent increase in gill cadmium and copper, but not in zinc, was observed during the 7-day exposure. Copper clearly affected the sodium levels in the gill tissue, while zinc and cadmium did not significantly alter any of the gill electrolytes. The overall histopathological effects (e.g. hyperemia and hypertrophy) of the metal exposures were mild for most of the alterations, and no metal specific pattern was elucidated for the tested metals except oedema of the primary epithelium which typically occurred in both levels of Zn exposure.",

How a group of mesoscopic numbers (hundreds-to-thousands) of cells, without pre-defined morphogens and spatial organization, self-organizes spatial patterns remains incompletely understood. Of particular importance are dynamic spatial patterns - such as spiral waves that perpetually move and transmit information over macroscopic length-scales. We developed an open-source, expandable software that can simulate a field of cells communicating with any number of cell-secreted molecules in any manner. With it and a theory developed here, we identified all possible \\\"cellular dialogues\\\" - ways of communicating with two diffusing molecules - and core architectures underlying them that enable diverse, self-organized dynamic spatial patterns that we classified. The patterns form despite widely varying cellular response to the molecules, gene-expression noise, and spatial arrangement and motility of cells. Three-stage, \\\"order-fluctuate-settle\\\" process forms dynamic spatial patterns: cells form long-lived whirlpools of wavelets that, through chaos-like interactions, settle into a dynamic spatial pattern. These results provide a blueprint to help identify missing regulatory links for observed dynamic-pattern formations and in building synthetic tissues.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional bursting is a major source of noise in gene expression. The telegraph model of gene expression, whereby transcription switches between \"on\" and \"off\" states, is the dominant model for bursting. Recently it was shown that the telegraph model cannot explain a number of experimental observations from perturbation data. Here we study an alternative model that is consistent with the data and which explicitly describes RNA polymerase recruitment and polymerase pause release, two steps necessary for mRNA production. We derive the exact steady-state distribution of mRNA numbers and an approximate steady-state distribution of protein numbers which are given by generalized hypergeometric functions. The theory is used to calculate the relative sensitivity of the coefficient of variation of mRNA fluctuations for thousands of genes in mouse fibroblasts. This indicates that the size of fluctuations is mostly sensitive to the rate of burst initiation and the mRNA degradation rate. Furthermore we show that (i) the time-dependent distribution of mRNA numbers is accurately approximated by a modified telegraph model with a Michaelis-Menten like dependence of the effective transcription rate on RNA polymerase abundance. (ii) the model predicts that if the polymerase recruitment rate is comparable or less than the pause release rate, then upon gene replication the mean number of RNA per cell remains approximately constant. This gene dosage compensation property has been experimentally observed and cannot be explained by the telegraph model with constant rates.\n\nStatement of SignificanceThe random nature of gene expression is well established experimentally. Mathematical modelling provides a means of understanding the factors leading to the observed stochasticity. There is evidence that the classical two-state model of stochastic mRNA dynamics (the telegraph model) cannot describe perturbation experiments and a new model that includes polymerase dynamics has been proposed. In this paper, we present the first detailed study of this model, deriving an exact solution for the mRNA distribution in steady-state conditions, an approximate time-dependent solution and showing the model can explain gene dosage compensation. As well, we use the theory together with transcriptomic data, to deduce which parameters when perturbed lead to a maximal change in the size of mRNA fluctuations.",

This paper proposes a novel method KDiffNet that incorporates Additional Knowledge in identifying Differential Networks via an Elementary Estimator. We design a novel hybrid norm as a superposition of two structured norms guided by the extra edge information and the additional node group knowledge. KDiffNet is solved through a fast parallel proximal algorithm, enabling it to work in large-scale settings. KDiffNet can incorporate various combinations of existing knowledge without re-designing the optimization. Through rigorous statistical analysis we show that, while considering more evidence, KDiffNet achieves the same convergence rate as the state-of-the-art. Empirically on multiple synthetic datasets and one real-world fMRI brain data, KDiffNet significantly outperforms the cutting edge baselines with regard to the prediction performance, while achieving the same level of time cost or less.",

    "abstract": "Patterns of discordance between gene trees and the species trees they reside in are crucial to the debate over the superiority of coalescent or concatenation approaches to tree inference. However, errors in estimating gene tree topologies obfuscate the issue by making gene trees appear erroneously discordant with the species tree. We thus test the prevalence of discordance between gene trees and their species tree using an empirical dataset for a clade with a rapid radiation (Blaberidae). We find that one model of codon evolution (FMutSel0) prefers gene trees that are less discordant, while another (SelAC) shows no such preference. We compare the species trees resulting from the selected sets of gene trees on the basis of internal consistency, predictive ability, and congruence with independent data. The species tree resulting from gene trees those chosen by FMutSel0, a set with low discordance, is the most robust and biologically plausible. Thus, we conclude that the results from FMutSel0 are better supported: simple models (i.e., GTR and ECM) infer trees with erroneously high levels of gene tree discordance. Furthermore, the amount of discordance in the set of gene trees has a large effect on the downstream phylogeny. Thus, decreasing gene tree error by lessening erroneous discordance can result in higher quality species trees. These results allow us to support relationships among blaberid cockroaches that were previously in flux as they now demonstrate molecular and morphological congruence.",

    "abstract": "The length and complexity of tuberculosis (TB) therapy, as well as the propensity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to develop drug resistance, are major barriers to global TB control efforts. M. tuberculosis is known to have the ability to enter into a drug-tolerant state, which may explain many of these impediments to TB treatment. We have identified a novel mechanism of genetically encoded but rapidly reversible drug-tolerance in M. tuberculosis caused by transient frameshift mutations in a homopolymeric tract (HT) of seven cytosines (7C) in the glpK gene. Inactivating frameshift mutations associated with the 7C HT in glpK produce small colonies that exhibit heritable multi-drug increases in minimal inhibitory concentrations and decreases in drug-dependent killing; however, reversion back to a fully drug-susceptible large-colony phenotype occurs rapidly through the introduction of additional insertions or deletions in the same glpK HT region. These reversible frameshift mutations in the 7C HT of M. tuberculosis glpK occur in clinical isolates, accumulate in M. tuberculosis infected mice with further accumulation during drug treatment, and exhibit a reversible transcriptional profile including induction of dosR and sigH and repression of kstR regulons, similar to that observed in other in vitro models of M. tuberculosis tolerance. These results suggest that GlpK phase variation may contribute to drug-tolerance, treatment failure and relapse in human TB. Drugs effective against phase-variant M. tuberculosis may hasten TB treatment and improve cure rates.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEThe ability of M. tuberculosis to survive during prolonged treatment has been attributed to either transient stress responses or fixed heritable drug-resistance producing mutations. We show that phase-variation in the M. tuberculosis glpK gene represents a third type of resistance mechanism. The ability of these glpK mutants to grow slowly and then rapidly revert suggests that these transiently-heritable changes may also explain how a hidden population of drug-tolerant bacteria develops during TB treatment. As a genetically trackable cause of drug-tolerance, M. tuberculosis glpK mutants provides a unique opportunity to study these phenomena at a cellular and mechanistic level. These mutants could also be used for developing drugs that target tolerant populations, leading to more rapid and effective TB treatments.",

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disease caused by loss of the survival motor neuron (SMN) gene. While there are currently two approved gene-based therapies for SMA, availability, high cost, and differences in patient response indicate that alternative treatment options are needed. Optimal therapeutic strategies will likely be a combination of SMN-dependent and -independent treatments aimed at alleviating symptoms in the central nervous system and peripheral muscles. Kruppel-like factor 15 (KLF15) is a transcription factor that regulates key metabolic and ergogenic pathways in muscle. We have recently reported significant downregulation of Klf15 in muscle of pre-symptomatic SMA mice. Importantly, perinatal upregulation of Klf15 via transgenic and pharmacological methods resulted in improved disease phenotypes in SMA mice, including weight and survival. In the current study, we designed an adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8) vector to overexpress a codon-optimised Klf15 cDNA under the muscle-specific Spc5-12 promoter (AAV8-Klf15). Administration of AAV8-Klf15 to severe Taiwanese Smn-/-;SMN2 or intermediate Smn2B/- SMA mice significantly increased Klf15 expression in muscle. We also observed significant activity of the AAV8-Klf15 vector in liver and heart. AAV8-mediated Klf15 overexpression moderately improved survival in the Smn2B/- model but not in the Taiwanese mice. An inability to specifically induce Klf15 expression at physiological levels in a time- and tissue-dependent manner may have contributed to this limited efficacy. Thus, our work demonstrates that an AAV8-Spc5-12 vector induces high gene expression as early as P2 in several tissues including muscle, heart and liver, but highlights the challenges of achieving meaningful vector-mediated transgene expression of Klf15.",

However, so far, most studies have focused on gal-1 and gal-3, and to a lesser extent to gal-7 and gal-9. We still know very little about other galectins, especially the recently discovered ones, such as gal-14, a prototype galectin highly expressed at the maternal-fetal interface. Here, using in silico and in vitro approaches, we report a correlation between lgals14 expression and ovarian cancer. We found that high expression of gal-14 mRNA in ovarian cancer cells is associated with a shorter survival. Consistent with this observation, we also found that lgals14 is preferentially expressed in high grade serous adenocarcinoma (HGSA) ovarian cancer. Our in vitro data with ovarian cancer cell lines confirmed that lgals14 is readily expressed in HGSA. Interestingly, de novo expression of gal-14 in HEK-293 cells increased apoptosis, both at the basal level and following exposure to low doses of etoposide. Thus, although the study of this galectin is still in its infancy, we were able to provide novel insights into the expression patterns of this galectin and its involvement in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Modification of flow regimes and habitat degradation are the strongest, most common, and often co-occurring human activities affecting riverine populations. Ongoing efforts to restore peak flow events found under pristine flow regimes could increase advection-driven dispersal for many species. In rivers with extensive habitat loss, increased advection could transport individuals from remnant populations into degraded downstream areas, causing restored flow regimes to decrease persistence of threatened species. To resolve the capacity for such  washout effects across imperiled taxa, we evaluate population growth in spatial matrix models of insect, fish, and mollusc taxa experiencing advective dispersal and either long-term habitat loss or temporary disturbances. As a case study to quantify advective dispersal in threatened species, we use intensive mark-recapture methods in a Rio Grande population of the federally endangered unionid mussel Texas horhshell (Popenaias popeii). Among unionids, the most threatened freshwater taxa of North America, we find high levels of annual downstream emigration (16-51%) of adult P. popeii, concomitant with strong immigration from upstream habitats. For different taxa experiencing such advective dispersal during specific life stages, our population model shows that washout effects strongly reduce population recovery under high levels of habitat loss. Averting this negative consequence of restoring hydrology requires simultaneously restoring or protecting long, contiguous stretches of suitable habitats. Across taxa in heavily impacted systems, we suggest integrating hydrodynamic studies and field surveys to detect the presence of advective dispersal and prioritize areas for habitat restoration to enhance population persistence.",

    "abstract": "Environmentally acquired microbial symbionts could contribute to host adaptation to local conditions like vertically transmitted symbionts do. This scenario necessitates symbionts to have different effects in different environments. We investigated this idea in Drosophila melanogaster, a species which communities of bacterial symbionts vary greatly among environments. We isolated four bacterial strains isolated from the feces of a D. melanogaster laboratory strain and tested their effects in two conditions: the ancestral environment (i.e. the laboratory medium) and a new environment (i.e. fresh fruit with live yeast). All bacterial effects on larval and adult traits differed among environments, ranging from very beneficial to marginally deleterious. The joint analysis of larval development speed and adult size further shows bacteria affected developmental plasticity more than resource acquisition. This effect was largely driven by the contrasted effects of the bacteria in each environment. Our study illustrates that understanding D. melanogaster symbiotic interactions in the wild will necessitate working in ecologically realistic conditions. Besides, context-dependent effects of symbionts, and their influence on host developmental plasticity, shed light on how environmentally acquired symbionts may contribute to host evolution.",

Metagenomics promises single-test identification, but shotgun sequencing remains unwieldy and expensive or in many cases insufficiently sensitive to detect the amount of pathogen material in a clinical sample. Here we present the validation and application of Castanet, a method for metagenomic sequencing with enrichment that exploits clinical knowledge to construct a broad panel of relevant organisms for detection at low cost with sensitivity comparable to PCR. Castanet targets both DNA and RNA, works with small sample volumes, and can be implemented in a high-throughput diagnostic setting. We used Castanet to analyse plasma samples from 573 patients from the GAinS sepsis cohort and CSF samples from 243 patients from the ChiMES meningitis cohort that had been evaluated using standard clinical microbiology methods, identifying relevant pathogens in many cases where no pathogen had previously been detected. Castanet is intended for use in defining the distribution of pathogens in samples, diseases and populations, for large-scale clinical studies and for verifying the performance of routine testing regimens. By providing sequence as output, Castanet combines pathogen identification directly with subtyping and phylo-epidemiology.",

    "abstract": "Primary human bronchial epithelial cell (HBEC) cultures are a useful model for studies of lung health and major airway diseases. However, mechanistic studies have been limited by our ability to selectively disrupt specific genes in these cells. Here we optimize methods for gene targeting in HBECs by direct delivery of single guide RNA (sgRNA) and recombinant Cas9 (rCas9) complexes by electroporation, without a requirement for plasmids, viruses, or antibiotic selection. Variations in the method of delivery, sgRNA and rCas9 concentrations, and sgRNA sequences all had effects on targeting efficiency, allowing for predictable control of the extent of gene targeting and for near complete disruption of gene expression. To demonstrate the value of this system, we targeted SPDEF, which encodes a transcription factor previously shown to be essential for the differentiation of MUC5AC-producing goblet cells in mouse models of asthma. Targeting SPDEF led to proportional decreases in MUC5AC expression in HBECs stimulated with IL-13, a central mediator of allergic asthma. Near-complete targeting of SPDEF abolished IL-13-induced MUC5AC expression and goblet cell differentiation. In addition, targeting of SPDEF prevented IL-13-induced impairment of mucociliary clearance, which is likely to be an important contributor to airway obstruction, morbidity, and mortality in asthma. We conclude that direct delivery of sgRNA and rCas9 complexes allows for predictable and efficient gene targeting and enables mechanistic studies of disease-relevant pathways in primary HBECs.",

    "abstract": "Much of Earths biodiversity has the capacity to engage in dormancy whereby individuals enter a reversible state of reduced metabolic activity. By increasing resilience to unfavorable conditions, dormancy leads to the accumulation of \\\"seed banks\\\" that should diminish the influence of environmental filtering, while allowing passive dispersers to colonize new habitats. Although prevalent among single-celled organisms, evidence that dormancy influences patterns of microbial biodiversity and biogeography is lacking. We constructed geographical and environmental distance-decay relationships (DDRs) using 16S rRNA sequencing to characterize the total (DNA) and the active (RNA) bacterial communities in a regional survey of 49 forested ponds. As expected, the total community harbored greater diversity and exhibited weaker DDRs than the active portion of the community. These empirical observations were robust to different measures of community similarity and random resampling tests. Furthermore, findings from the field survey were reproduced by models that included aspects of dormancy along with the geographical coordinates and environmental characteristics of our study system. In addition to maintaining local diversity, our results support recent theoretical predictions that dormancy shapes geographical patterns of biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "Recent massive outbreaks of yellow fever virus (YFV) in West Africa and Brazil resulted in rapid depletion of global vaccine emergency stockpiles and raised concerns about being not prepared against future YFV epidemics. Here we report that a live-attenuated virus similar to the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) vaccine JE-CVax/Imojev(R) that consists of YFV-17D vaccine from which the structural (prM/E) genes have been replaced with those of the JEV SA14-14-2 vaccine strain confers full protection in mice against lethal YFV challenge. In contrast to the YFV-17D mediated protection against YFV, this protection is not mediated by neutralizing antibodies but correlates with YFV-specific non-neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses against cell-associated YFV NS1 and other YFV non-structural (NS) proteins. Our findings reveal the importance of YFV NS proteins to mediate protection and demonstrate that chimeric flavivirus vaccines, such as Imojev(R) can confer protection against two flaviviruses. This dual protection has implications for the possible off-label use of JE-CVax in case of emergency and vaccine shortage during YFV outbreaks. In addition, populations in Asia that have been vaccinated with Imojev(R) may already be protected against YFV should outbreaks ever occur on that continent as feared by WHO.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEEfficient and safe vaccines exist against yellow fever (e.g. YFV-17D) that provide long-lasting protection by rapidly inducing neutralizing antibody responses. However, vaccine supply cannot cope with an increasing demand posed by massive urban outbreaks in recent years. Here we report that JE-CVax/Imojev(R), a YFV-17D-based chimeric Japanese encephalitis vaccine also efficiently protects against YFV infection in mice. In case of shortage of the YFV vaccine during yellow fever outbreaks, (off-label) use of JE-CVax/Imojev(R) may be considered. Moreover, wider use of JE-CVax/Imojev(R) in Asia may lower the risk of the much-feared YFV spill over to the continent. More in general chimeric vaccines that combine surface antigens and replication machineries of two distinct flaviviruses can be considered dual vaccines, for the latter pathogen without induction of surface-specific antibodies. Following this rationale, novel flavivirus vaccines that do not hold a risk for antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection [inherent to current dengue vaccines and dengue vaccine candidates] could be designed.",

    "abstract": "Much research in cognitive neuroscience supports prediction as a canonical computation of cognition across domains. Is such predictive coding implemented by feedback from higher-order domain-general circuits, or is it locally implemented in domain-specific circuits? What information sources are used to generate these predictions? This study addresses these two questions in the context of language processing. We present fMRI evidence from a naturalistic comprehension paradigm (1) that predictive coding in the brains response to language is domain-specific, and (2) that these predictions are sensitive both to local word co-occurrence patterns and to hierarchical structure. Using a recently developed continuous-time deconvolutional regression technique that supports data-driven hemodynamic response function discovery from continuous BOLD signal fluctuations in response to naturalistic stimuli, we found effects of prediction measures in the language network but not in the domain-general multiple-demand network, which supports executive control processes and has been previously implicated in language comprehension. Moreover, within the language network, surface-level and structural prediction effects were separable. The predictability effects in the language network were substantial, with the model capturing over 37% of explainable variance on held-out data. These findings indicate that human sentence processing mechanisms generate predictions about upcoming words using cognitive processes that are sensitive to hierarchical structure and specialized for language processing, rather than via feedback from high-level executive control mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Actions are rarely devoid of emotional content. Thus, a more complete picture of the neural mechanisms underlying mental simulation of observed actions requires more research using emotion information. The present study used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate mental simulation associated with facial emotion categorisation. Mu rhythm modulation was measured to infer the degree of sensorimotor simulation. Categorising static images of neutral faces as happy or sad was associated with stronger mu suppression than categorising clearly happy or sad faces. Results suggest the sensitivity of the sensorimotor activity to emotional information rather than visual attentional engagement, because further control analyses revealed (1) no effect of emotion type on occipital alpha modulation, and (2) no difference in mu modulation between the conditions of a control task, which required categorising images with the head oriented right, left, or forward as right or left. This finding provides evidence for the role of the sensorimotor activity in a higher form of mental simulation. Consistent with a predictive coding account of action perception, stronger mu suppression during attempted emotion categorisation of neutral faces may involve minimising the mismatch between predicted kinematics of a happy/sad face and the observed stationarity of neutral faces.",

    "abstract": "Snakebite envenoming causes 138,000 deaths annually and ~400,000 victims are left with permanent disabilities. Envenoming by saw-scaled vipers (Viperidae: Echis) leads to systemic hemorrhage and coagulopathy, and represents a major cause of snakebite mortality and morbidity in Africa and Asia. The only specific treatment for snakebite, antivenom, has poor specificity, low affordability, and must be administered in clinical settings due to its intravenous delivery and high rates of adverse reactions. This requirement results in major treatment delays in resource-poor regions and impacts substantially on patient outcomes following envenoming. Here we investigated the value of metal chelators as novel community-based therapeutics for snakebite. Among the tested chelators, dimercaprol (British anti-Lewisite) and its derivative 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS), were found to potently antagonize the activity of Zn2+-dependent snake venom metalloproteinase toxins in vitro. Moreover, DMPS prolonged or conferred complete survival in murine preclinical models of envenoming against a variety of saw-scaled viper venoms. DMPS also significantly extended survival in a  challenge and treat model, where drug administration was delayed post-venom injection, and the oral administration of this chelator provided partial protection against envenoming. Finally, the potential clinical scenario of early oral DMPS therapy combined with a later, delayed, intravenous dose of conventional antivenom provided prolonged protection against the lethal effects of envenoming in vivo. Our findings demonstrate that safe and affordable repurposed metal chelators effectively neutralize saw-scaled viper venoms in vitro and in vivo and highlight the great promise of DMPS as a novel, community-based, early therapeutic intervention for hemotoxic snakebite envenoming.",

    "abstract": "Torpor is a state of controlled reduction of metabolic rate (M) in endotherms. Assigning measurements of M to torpor or euthermy can be challenging, especially when the difference between euthermic M and torpid M is small, in species defending a high minimal body temperature in torpor, in thermolabile species, and slightly below the thermoneutral zone (TNZ). Here, we propose a novel method for distinguishing torpor from euthermy. We use the variation in M measured during euthermic rest and torpor at varying ambient temperatures (Ta) to objectively estimate the lower critical temperature (Tlc) of the TNZ and to assign measurements to torpor, euthermic rest or rest within TNZ. In addition, this method allows the prediction of M during euthermic rest and torpor at varying Ta, including resting M within the TNZ. The present method has shown highly satisfactory results using 28 published sets of metabolic data obtained by respirometry on 26 species of mammals. Ultimately, this novel method aims to facilitate analysis of respirometry data in heterothermic endotherms. Finally, the development of the associated R-package (torpor) will enable widespread use of the method amongst biologists.\n\nSummary statementThe presented method and its associated R-package (torpor) enable the assignment of metabolic rate measurements to torpor or euthermy, ultimately improving the standardization of respirometry analyses in heterotherms.",

    "abstract": "Around 3.5 billion people are colonized by intestinal parasites worldwide. Intestinal parasitic eukaryotes interact not only with the host, but also with the intestinal microbiota. In this work, we studied the relationship between the presence of multiple enteric parasites and the community structure of the bacterial and eukaryote intestinal microbiota in an asymptomatic cohort of mother-child binomials from a semi-rural community in Mexico. The intestinal parasites identified were Blastocystis hominis, Entamoeba histolytica/dispar, Endolimax nana, Chilomastix mesnili, Iodamoeba butshlii, Entamoeba coli, Hymenolepis nana and Ascaris lumbricoides. We sequenced bacterial 16S rDNA and eukaryotic 18S rDNA in fecal samples of 46 mothers and their respective children, with ages ranging from two to twenty months. Although we did not find significant alpha-diversity changes, we found a significant effect of parasite exposure on bacterial beta-diversity, which explained between 5.2% and 15.0% of the variation of the bacterial community structure. Additionally, exposure to parasites was associated with significant changes in relative abundances of bacterial taxa, characterized by increases in the Clostridia and decreased Actinobacteria and Bacteroidia abundances. There were no significant changes of intestinal microeukaryote abundances associated with parasite exposure. However, we found several significant positive correlations between intestinal bacteria and eukaryotes, including co-occurrence of the fungi Candida tropicalis with Bacteroides and Actinomyces, and Saccharomycetales with Bifidobacterium and Prevotella copri. These bacterial community structure changes associated with parasite exposure imply effects on microbial metabolic routes, host nutrient uptake abilities and intestinal immunity regulation in host-parasite interactions.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEThe impact of intestinal eukaryotes on the prokaryotic microbiome composition of asymptomatic carriers has not been extensively explored, especially in children and in hosts with multiple parasites. In this work, we studied the relationship between protist and helminth parasite colonization and intestinal microbiota structure in an asymptomatic population of mother-child binomials from the semi-rural community of Morelos in Mexico. We found that the presence of parasitic eukaryotes correlated with changes in the bacterial community structure in the intestinal microbiota in an age-dependent way. This was characterized by an increase of the relative abundance of the class Clostridia and the decrease of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidia. While there were no significant associations between the presence of parasites and microeukaryote community structure, we observed strong positive correlations between bacterial and eukaryote taxa, identifying novel relationships between prokaryotes and fungi, and reflecting the diet of the human population studied.",

    "abstract": "Gardnerella spp. are hallmarks of bacterial vaginosis, a clinically significant dysbiosis of the vaginal microbiome. Gardnerella has four subgroups (A, B, C and D) based on cpn60 sequences. Multiple subgroups are often detected in individual women, and interactions between these subgroups are expected to influence their population dynamics and associated signs and symptoms of bacterial vaginosis. In the present study, contact-independent and contact-dependent interactions between the four Gardnerella subgroups were investigated in vitro. The cell free supernatants of mono- and co-cultures had no effect on growth rates of the Gardnerella subgroups suggesting that there are no contact-independent interactions (and no contest competition). For contact-dependent interactions, mixed communities of 2, 3 or 4 subgroups were created and the initial (0 h) and final population sizes (48 h) were quantified using subgroup-specific PCR. Compared to the null hypothesis of additive interactions, most (69.3%) of the mixed communities exhibited competition (p < 0.0001). Competition reduced the growth rates of subgroups A, B and C. In contrast, the growth rate of subgroup D increased in the presence of the other subgroups (p < 0.0001). All subgroups were able to form biofilm alone and in mixed communities. Our study suggests that there is scramble competition among Gardnerella subgroups, which likely contributes to the observed distributions of Gardnerella spp. in vaginal microbiomes and the formation of the multispecies biofilms characteristic of bacterial vaginosis.",

    "abstract": "Obligately chemoautotrophic Campylobacteria dominate productivity in dark, sulfidic, and oxygen-depleted environments. However, biochemical mechanisms underlying their growth remain poorly known, limiting understanding of their physiology, ecology, and biogeochemical impact. In this study, we used comparative genomics, conceptual modeling of core metabolism, and chemostat growth yields to derive a model of energy conservation consistent with experimental data for the versatile chemoautotroph Sulfurimonas denitrificans. Our model rests on three core mechanisms: Firstly, to allow electrogenic sulfur-based denitrification, we predict that the campylobacterial-type sulfur oxidation enzyme complex must donate electrons to the membrane quinone pool, possibly via a sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase. Secondly, to account for the unexpectedly low growth efficiency of aerobic sulfur oxidation compared to denitrification, we posit the high-affinity campylobacterial-type cbb3 cytochrome c oxidase has a relatively low H+/e- of 1, likely due to a lack of proton pumping under physiological conditions. Thirdly, we hypothesize that reductant for carbon fixation by the reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle is produced by a non-canonical complex I that reduces both ferredoxin and NAD(P)H. This complex is conserved among related Campylobacteria and may have allowed for the radiation of organisms like S. denitrificans into sulfur-rich environments that became available after the great oxidation event. Our theoretical model has two major implications. Firstly, it sets the stage for future experimental work by providing testable hypotheses about the physiology, biochemistry, and evolution of chemoautotrophic Campylobacteria. Secondly, it provides constraints on the carbon fixation potential of chemoautotrophic Campylobacteria in sulfidic environments worldwide by predicting theoretical ranges of chemosynthetic growth efficiency.\\n\\nSignificanceChemoautotrophic Campylobacteria are abundant in many low-oxygen, high-sulfide environments where they contribute significantly to dark carbon fixation. Although the overall redox reactions they catalyze are known, the specific biochemical mechanisms that support their growth are mostly unknown. Our study combines conceptual modeling of core metabolic pathways, comparative genomics, and measurements of physiological growth yield in a chemostat to infer the most likely mechanisms of chemoautotrophic energy conservation in the model organism Sulfurimonas denitrificans. The hypotheses proposed herein are novel, experimentally falsifiable, and will guide future biochemical, physiological, and environmental modelling studies. Ultimately, investigating the core mechanisms of energy conservation will help us better understand the evolution and physiological diversification of chemoautotrophic Campylobacteria and their role in modern ecosystems.",
