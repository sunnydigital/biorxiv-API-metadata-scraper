    "abstract": "The nitrogenase metalloenzyme family, essential for supplying fixed nitrogen to the biosphere, is one of lifes key biogeochemical innovations. The three isozymes of nitrogenase differ in their metal dependence, each binding either a FeMo-, FeV-, or FeFe-cofactor where the reduction of dinitrogen takes place. The history of nitrogenase metal dependence has been of particular interest due to the possible implication that ancient marine metal availabilities have significantly constrained nitrogenase evolution over geologic time. Here, we reconstructed the evolutionary history of nitrogenases, and combined phylogenetic reconstruction, ancestral sequence inference, and structural homology modeling to evaluate the potential metal dependence of ancient nitrogenases. We find that active-site sequence features can reliably distinguish extant Mo-nitrogenases from V- and Fe-nitrogenases, and that inferred ancestral sequences at the deepest nodes of the phylogeny suggest these ancient proteins most resemble modern Mo-nitrogenases. Taxa representing early-branching nitrogenase lineages lack one or more biosynthetic nifE and nifN genes that both contribute to the assembly of the FeMo-cofactor in studied organisms, suggesting that early Mo-nitrogenases may have utilized an alternate and/or simplified pathway for cofactor biosynthesis. Our results underscore the profound impacts that protein-level innovations likely had on shaping global biogeochemical cycles throughout the Precambrian, in contrast to organism-level innovations that characterize the Phanerozoic Eon.",

    "abstract": "Humans engagement in music rests on underlying elements such as the listeners cultural background and general interest in music, all shaping the way music is processed in the brain and perceived. Crucially, these factors modulate how listeners anticipate musical events, a process inducing instantaneous neural responses as the music confronts these expectations. Measuring such neural correlates would represent a direct window into high-level brain processing of music. Here we recorded electroencephalographic and electrocorticographic brain responses as participants listened to Bach melodies. We assessed the relative contributions of the acoustic versus melodic components of the music to the neural signal. Acoustic features included envelope and its derivative. Melodic features included information on melodic progressions (pitch) and their tempo (onsets), which were extracted from a Markov model predicting the next note based on a corpus of Western music and the preceding proximal musical context. We related the music to brain activity with a linear temporal response function, and demonstrated that cortical responses to music encode melodic expectations. Specifically, individual-subject neural signals were better predicted by a combination of acoustic and melodic expectation features than by either alone. This effect was most pronounced at response latencies up to 350ms, and in both planum temporale and Heschls gyrus. Finally, expectations of pitch and onset-time of musical notes exerted independent cortical effects, and such influences were modulated by the listeners musical expertise. Overall, this study demonstrates how the interplay of experimental and theoretical approaches can yield novel insights into the cortical encoding of melodic expectations.",

    "abstract": "Different types of -synuclein and non-{beta}-amyloid component (NAC) peptides have been shown to induce cell death, with varying degree of toxicity, in various in vitro experiments. Oxidative stress has also been associated and proved to be involved in the pathogenesis of neuronal cell death in Parkinsons disease. Oxidative stress has been shown to accelerate the aggregation of -synuclein in vitro and in resent studies -synuclein has been shown to increase oxidative stress. Thus it seems like a vicious cycle, one promoting the other.\\n\\nIn this present work we have modeled the -synuclein pathway to increase cytoplasmic Dopamine concentration, and thereby increasing the Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) level of the cell, which consequently results in cell death. This model relates the -synuclein concentration with the fractional cell survival and provides insight of crucial reaction(s) of -synuclein which promote cell death. It predicts the toxicity of the type of -synuclein and also explains the pattern of cell death with increasing concentration of -synuclein. First we modeled a part of the pathway i.e. from dopamine to cell death. The results were compared with experimental data available for PC12 neuronal cell line. Then modeling of full pathway was done and the results were compared with experimental data available for Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. It is predicted from this model that higher the auto catalysis of dopamine, higher is the cell death. Interestingly, the model predicts that NAC (1-18) not only hinders the vesicles coming from Endoplasmic Reticulum, to fuse with Golgi bodies, but also reduces the synthesis of Dopamine and the formation of vesicles from Endoplasmic Reticulum. The model is generalized and can predict the toxicity of any protein which impedes the early secretary pathway in dopaminergic cells and also the cell survival pattern with increasing concentration of the protein.",

We have previously shown that central carbon metabolism is rewired in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) to support proliferation through a glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 1 (GOT1)-dependent pathway. Here we tested if tissue type impacted GOT1 dependence by comparing PDA and colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines and tumor models of similar genotype. We found CRC to be insensitive to GOT1 inhibition, contrasting markedly with PDA, which exhibit profound growth inhibition upon GOT1 knockdown. Utilizing a combination of metabolomics strategies and computational modeling, we found that GOT1 inhibition disrupted glycolysis, nucleotide metabolism, and redox homeostasis in PDA but not CRC. These insights were leveraged in PDA, where we demonstrate that radiotherapy potently enhanced the effect of GOT1 inhibition on tumor growth. Taken together, these results illustrate the role of tissue type in dictating metabolic dependencies and provide new insights for targeting metabolism to treat PDA.",

    "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms of pain associated with alphaherpesvirus latency are not clear. We hypothesize that the voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC) on dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons controlling electrical impulses may have abnormal activity during viral latent infection and reactivation. We used HSV-1 to infect human DRG-derived neuronal cell line HD10.6 to study viral latency establishment, maintenance and reactivation as well as changes of VGSC functional expression. Differentiated cells exhibited robust tetrodotoxin (TTX) sensitive sodium currents and acute infection significantly reduced the VGSC functional expression within 24 hours, and completely abolished the VGSC activity within three days lytic infection. A quiescent state of infection mimicking latency can be achieved by HSV infection in the presence of acyclovir (ACV) for 7 days followed by 5 days of ACV washout and the viruses can remain dormant for another three weeks. It was noted that during HSV-1 latency establishment, the loss of VGSC activity caused by HSV-1 infection could not be blocked by ACV treatment within 3 days infection. However, neurons with continued treatment of ACV for another 4 days showed a gradual recovery of VGSC functional expression. Furthermore, the latent neurons exhibited higher VGSC activity in comparison to controls. The overall regulation of VGSC by HSV-1 during its quiescent infection was proved by increased transcription and possible translation of Nav1.7. Together these observations demonstrated a very complex pattern of electrophysiological changes during HSV infection of DRG neurons, which may have implication for understanding the mechanisms of virus-mediated pain linked to latency and reactivation.\\n\\nImportanceThe reactivation of the herpesvirus from ganglionic neurons may cause cranial nerve disorders and unbearable pain. It is unclear why normal stimuli would trigger enhanced pain sensation in these patients. The current work meticulously studies the functional expression profile changes of VGSC during the process of latency establishment using an in vitro model. Our results indicated that VGSC activity was eliminated upon infection but steadily recovered during the latency establishment and the latent neurons exhibited even higher VGSC activity. This finding advances our knowledge of how ganglion neurons generated uncharacteristic electrical impulses due to abnormal VGSC functional expression influenced by latent virus.",

    "abstract": "From psychology to economics there has been substantial interest in how costs (e.g., delay, risk) are represented asymmetrically during decision-making when attempting to gain reward or to avoid punishment. For example, in decision-making under risk, individuals show a tendency to prefer to avoid punishment than to acquire the equivalent reward (loss aversion). Although the cost of physical effort has received significant recent attention due to the evaluation of motor costs being crucial in our daily decisions, it remains unclear whether loss aversion exists during effort-based decision-making. On the one hand, loss aversion may be hardwired due to asymmetric evolutionary pressure on losses and gains and therefore exists across decision-making contexts. On the other hand, distinct brain regions are involved with different decision costs, making it questionable whether similar asymmetries exist. Here, we demonstrate that young healthy participants exhibit loss aversion during effort-based decision-making by exerting more physical effort in order to avoid punishment than to gain a same-size reward. Next, we show that medicated Parkinsons disease (PD) patients show a reduction in loss aversion compared to age-matched controls. Behavioural and computational analysis revealed that people with PD exerted similar physical effort in return for a reward, but were less willing to produce effort in order to avoid punishment. Therefore, loss aversion is present during effort-based decision-making and can be modulated by altered dopaminergic state. This finding could have important implications for our understanding of clinical disorders that show a reduced willingness to exert effort in the pursuit of reward.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLoss aversion - preferring to avoid punishment than to acquire equivalent reward - is an important concept in decision-making under risk. However, little is known about whether loss aversion also exists during decisions where the cost is physical effort. This is surprising given that motor cost shapes human behaviour, and a reduced willingness to exert effort is a characteristic of many clinical disorders. Here, we show that healthy individuals exert more effort to minimise punishment than to maximise reward (loss aversion). We also demonstrate that loss aversion is modulated by altered dopaminergic state by showing that medicated Parkinsons disease patients exert similar effort to gain reward but less effort to avoid punishment. Therefore, dopamine-dependent loss aversion is crucial for explaining effort-based decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) has been the driving force for identifying association between genetic variants and human phenotypes. Thousands of GWAS summary statistics covering a broad range of human traits and diseases are now publicly available, and studies have demonstrated their utility for a range of secondary analyses. This includes in particular the joint analysis of multiple GWAS to identify new genetic variants missed by univariate screenings. However, although several methods have been proposed, there are very few large scale applications published so far because of challenges in implementing these methods on real data. Here, we present JASS (Joint Analysis of Summary Statistics), a polyvalent Python package that addresses this need. Our package solves all practical and computational barriers for large-scale multivariate analysis of GWAS summary statistics. This includes data cleaning and harmonization tools, an efficient algorithm for fast derivation of various joint statistics, an optimized data management process, and a web interface for exploration purposes. Benchmark analyses confirmed the strong performances of JASS. We also performed multiple real data analyses demonstrating the strong potential of JASS for the detection of new associated genetic variants across various scenarios.

Prior studies using self-report questionnaires have demonstrated that better social relationships (SR) form the foundation for better SWB. To confirm the relationships with objective measure and investigate the biological underpinning, we conducted connectome-based prediction modeling with a 10-fold cross-validation, utilizing resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data (n = 761). Two aspects of SWB (life satisfaction and positive affect) were successfully predicted using SR-related functional connections (FCs). The models also showed good prediction performance in a validation sample (n = 91), suggesting that our models are generalizable. All six aspects of SR considered were related to different sets of FCs with minimal overlap in edge level. The contributions of these FC sets to the two aspects of SWB were substantially different. In the future, effort should be made to improve all aspects of SR to achieve better SWB.",

The morphology of the vacuole is controlled by the actin cytoskeleton but the mechanistic connection between them remains largely elusive. Recently, the NETWORKED (NET) family of membrane-associated, actin-binding proteins has been identified and represent potential candidates to impact on vacuolar morphology. Here, we show that NET4A localizes to highly constricted regions in the vacuolar membrane and contributes to the compactness of the vacuole. Using genetic interference, we found that deregulation of NET4 abundance impacts on vacuole morphogenesis and overexpression leads to more compact vacuoles. We moreover show that the NET4A-induced changes in vacuolar shape correlates with reduced cellular and organ growth in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our results demonstrate that NET4 modulates the compactness of vacuoles and reveal higher complexity in the regulation of actin-reliant vacuolar morphology.",

We also find that sequential targeting of lipidated RAB28 to periciliary and ciliary membranes is highly dependent on the BBSome and PDE6D, respectively, and that BBSome loss causes excessive and ectopic EV production. Our data indicate that RAB28 and the BBSome are key in vivo regulators of EV production at the periciliary membrane. Our findings also suggest that EVs control sensory organ homeostasis by mediating communication between ciliated neurons and glia, and that defects in ciliary EV biogenesis may contribute to human ciliopathies.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) continue to be a significant public health problem. Early life stress and adversity have long-lasting effects on a wide range of behaviors, including responses to drugs of abuse. Epidemiological evidence indicates that exposure to early life stress contributes to alcohol use disorders and, while it is known that stress and alcohol both act on overlapping mesolimbic circuitry, the cellular mechanisms underlying the relationship between stress and alcohol intake are not well understood. Previous work has demonstrated that acute stress increases ethanol intake mediated by changes in GABA signaling within the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Here we investigated if adolescent stress exposure might elicit long-term, persistent increases in ethanol self-administration associated with altered VTA GABA signaling. To this end, we exposed adolescent postnatal day (PND) 28 male rats to 14 days of chronic variable stress (CVS) and then examined operant ethanol self-administration begun at least 30 days later. We found that adolescent stress exposure resulted in significantly increased ethanol self-administration in adulthood. In contrast, adult (PND 82) male rats exposed to the same CVS protocol did not display increased ethanol self-administration that was begun 30 days later. Furthermore, we found that adolescent stress exposure resulted in enhancement of ethanol-induced GABA signaling onto VTA dopamine neurons and impairments in VTA GABA chloride homeostasis. The results indicate that adolescence is a period vulnerable to stress, which produces long-term changes in VTA GABA signaling associated with increased ethanol self-administration behavior.",

    "abstract": "Due to the local enrichment of factors that influence its formation, dynamics, and organization, the actin cytoskeleton displays different shapes and functions within the same cell. In yeast cells post-Golgi vesicles ride on long actin cables to the bud tip. The scaffold proteins Boi1 and Boi2 participate in tethering and docking these vesicles to the plasma membrane. Here we show that Boi1/2 also recruit nucleation and elongation factors to form actin filaments at sites of exocytosis. Disrupting the physical connection between Boi1/2 and the nucleation factor Bud6 impairs filament formation in the bud, reduces the directed movement of the vesicles to the tip, and shortens their tethering time at the cortex. Artificially transplanting Boi1 from the bud tip to the peroxisomal membrane partially redirects the actin cytoskeleton and the vesicular flow towards the peroxisome, and creates an alternative, rudimentary vesicle-docking zone. We conclude that Boi1/2 is sufficient to induce the formation of a cortical actin structure that receives and aligns incoming vesicles before fusing with the membrane.",

Two genes with GR-DMRs exhibited distinct methylation and transcriptional sensitivities to GR: the widely expressed direct GR target fkbp5 and neuron-specific aplp1. In larvae, neural activity is required for GR-mediated transcription of aplp1, but not for that of fkbp5. GR regulates metabotropic glutamate receptor gene expression, the activities of which also modulated aplp1 expression, implicating synaptic neurotransmission as an effector of GR function upstream of aplp1. Our results identify two distinct routes of GR-regulated transcription in the brain, including a pathway through which GR couples endocrine signalling to synaptic activity-regulated transcription by modulating metabotropic glutamate receptor expression.",
