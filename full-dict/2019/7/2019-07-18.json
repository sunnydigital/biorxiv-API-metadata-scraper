    "abstract": "The drivers of community coexistence are known to vary with environment, but their consistency across latitudes and scales, and resulting conservation implications, remain little understood. Here, we combine functional and phylogenetic evidence along elevations to document strong biotic constraints on coexistence in avian communities in both benign (tropical low elevations) and severely harsh (temperate/polar highlands) environments. Assemblages in both are marked by high assemblage functional uniqueness, whereas in tropical highlands and temperate/polar low elevations there is strong functionally redundancy and pronounced environmental constraints. Only in harsh environments is phylogeny an effective surrogate for functional assemblage structure, reflecting nuanced shifts in the position, shape, and composition of measured multivariate trait space along gradients. Independent of scale and latitude, high elevation assemblages emerge as exceptionally susceptible to functional change.",

    "abstract": "Threats to crop production due to climate change are one of the greatest challenges facing plant breeders today. While considerable adaptive variation exists in traditional landraces, natural populations of crop wild relatives, and ex situ germplasm collections, separating adaptive alleles from linked deleterious variants that impact agronomic traits is challenging and has limited the utility of these diverse germplasm resources. Modern genome editing techniques such as CRISPR offer a potential solution by targeting specific alleles for transfer to new backgrounds, but such methods require a higher degree of precision than traditional mapping approaches can achieve. Here we present a high-resolution genome-wide association analysis to identify loci exhibiting adaptive patterns in a large panel of more than 4500 traditional maize landraces representing the breadth of genetic diversity of maize in Mexico. We evaluate associations between genotype and plant performance in 13 common gardens across a range of environments, identifying hundreds of candidate genes underlying genotype by environment interaction. We further identify genetic associations with environment across Mexico and show that such loci are associated with variation in yield and flowering time in our field trials and predict performance in independent drought trials. Our results indicate that the variation necessary to adapt crops to changing climate exists in traditional landraces that have been subject to ongoing environmental adaptation and can be identified by both phenotypic and environmental association.",

    "abstract": "Mutation is the ultimate source of all genetic novelty and the cause of heritable genetic disorders. Mutational burden has been linked to complex disease, including neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. The rate of mutation is a fundamental genomic parameter and direct estimates of this parameter have been enabled by accurate comparisons of whole-genome sequences between parents and offspring. Studies in humans have revealed that the paternal age at conception explains most of the variation in mutation rate: each additional year of paternal age in humans leads to approximately 1.5 additional mutations inherited by the child. Here, we present an estimate of the de novo mutation rate in the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) using whole-genome sequence data from 32 individuals in four large pedigrees. We estimated an average mutation rate of 0.58 x 10-8 per base pair per generation (at an average parental age of 7.5 years), much lower than found in direct estimates from great apes (including human, chimpanzee, and gorilla). As in humans, older macaque fathers transmit more mutations to their offspring, approximately 1.5 extra mutations per year in our probands. Mutations at CpG sites accounted for 24% of all observed point mutations. We found that the rate of mutation accumulation after puberty is similar between macaques and humans, but that a smaller number of mutations accumulate before puberty in macaques. We additionally investigated the role of paternal age on offspring sociability, a proxy for normal neurodevelopment. In 203 male macaques studied in large social groups, we found no relationship between paternal age and multiple measures of social function. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders with paternal age in primates is not primarily due to de novo mutations.",

    "abstract": "Interaction analysis is used to investigate the magnitude of an effect which two risk factors have on disease risk, and on each other. To study interactions, both additive and multiplicative models have been used, although their interpretations are not universally understood. In this study, we set out to investigate the resulting interactions of several risk factors relationships in additive or multiplicative scenarios using simulations, in the context of case-control studies. Our simulation set up showed that independent risk factors approach additive relative risk at low disease prevalence. However, risk factors that contribute to the same chain of events (i.e. have synergy) lead to multiplicative relative risk. Additionally, thresholds on the number of required risk factors for a disease (the multifactorial threshold model) lead to intermediaries between additive and multiplicative risks. We proposed a novel measure of interaction consistent with additive, multiplicative and multifactorial threshold models. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the simulation strategy and discovered relationships on real data by analyzing and interpreting gene-gene odds ratios from a case-control rheumatoid arthritis study.",

    "abstract": "Advances in DNA sequencing have made it feasible to gather genomic data for non-model organisms and large sets of individuals, often using methods for sequencing subsets of the genome. Several of these methods sequence DNA associated with endonuclease restriction sites (various RAD and GBS methods). For use in taxa without a reference genome, these methods rely on de novo assembly of fragments in the sequencing library. Many of the software options available for this application were originally developed for other assembly types and we do not know their accuracy for reduced representation libraries. To address this important knowledge gap, we simulated data from the Arabidopsis thaliana and Homo sapiens genomes and compared de novo assemblies by six software programs that are commonly used or promising for this purpose (ABySS, CD-HIT, Stacks, Stacks2, Velvet and VSEARCH). We simulated different mutation rates and types of mutations, and then applied the six assemblers to the simulated datasets, varying assembly parameters. We found substantial variation in software performance across simulations and parameter settings. ABySS failed to recover any true genome fragments, and Velvet and VSEARCH performed poorly for most simulations. Stacks and Stacks2 produced accurate assemblies of simulations containing SNPs, but the addition of insertion and deletion mutations decreased their performance. CD-HIT was the only assembler that consistently recovered a high proportion of true genome fragments. Here, we demonstrate the substantial difference in the accuracy of assemblies from different software programs and the importance of comparing assemblies that result from different parameter settings.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSurgery is an invasive procedure evoking acute inflammatory and immune responses that are believed to mediate risk for postoperative complications including cognitive dysfunction and delirium. Although the specific mechanisms driving these responses have not been well-characterized, they are hypothesized to involve the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. We quantified genome-wide levels of DNA methylation in purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) longitudinally collected from 55 elderly patients undergoing three types of major surgery (elective colorectal and hip replacement surgery, and emergency hip fracture surgery), comparing samples collected at baseline to those collected immediately post-operatively and at discharge from hospital.\\n\\nResultsMajor surgery was associated with acute changes in DNA methylation at sites annotated to immune system genes, paralleling changes in serum-levels of markers including C-reactive protein (CRP) and Interleukin 6 (IL-6) measured in the same individuals. Although many of the observed changes in DNA methylation are consistent across the three types of surgery, there is notable heterogeneity between surgery types at certain loci. The acute changes in DNA methylation induced by surgery are relatively stable in the postoperative period, generally persisting until discharge from hospital.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results highlight the dramatic alterations in gene regulation induced by invasive surgery, primarily reflecting upregulation of the immune system in response to trauma, wound healing and anaesthesia.",

    "abstract": "Depression has been associated with increased inflammatory proteins but changes in circulating immune cells are less well defined. We used multi-parametric flow cytometry to investigate 14 subsets of peripheral blood cells in 206 cases of major depressive disorder (MDD) and 77 age- and sex-matched controls. There were significant case-control differences, by univariate and multivariate analysis: cases showed increased immune cell counts, especially neutrophils, CD4+ T cells and monocytes, and increased inflammatory proteins (C-reactive protein and interleukin-6). Within-group analysis demonstrated significant association between the severity of depressive symptoms and increased myeloid and CD4+ cell counts. MDD cases could be partitioned into two groups by forced binary clustering of cell counts: the inflamed depression group (N=81 out of 206; 39%) had increased monocyte, CD4+ and neutrophil counts, increased C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin 6 (IL-6), and was more depressed than the uninflamed majority of cases. Relaxing the presumption of a binary classification, data-driven clustering identified four subgroups of MDD cases: two of these subgroups (N=38 and N=100; 67% collectively) were associated with increased inflammatory proteins and more severe depression, but differed from each other in the relative weighting of myeloid and lymphoid cell counts. Case-control and within-group results were robust to statistical control for the potentially confounding effects of age, sex, BMI, recent infection status, and tobacco use. Peripheral blood immunophenotyping can be used to identify a candidate cellular biomarker of inflamed depression, and to further decompose that binary partition, suggesting that there is more than one mechanistic pathway underlying inflamed depression.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryTwo subgroups of depressed cases (about two-thirds of all 206 cases) were identified by peripheral blood biomarker evidence of distinctive cellular immunophenotypes, biased towards the myeloid or lymphoid lineages in different subgroups, but consistently associated with increased blood concentrations of inflammatory proteins and greater severity of depressive symptoms.",

Critically, the identity of the peptide recognized by the TCR is preserved, providing the link between peptide and gene.

    "abstract": "Mammalian RIG-I-like receptors detect viral dsRNA and 5 triphosphorylated RNA to activate transcription of interferon genes and promote antiviral defense. The C. elegans RIG-I-like receptor DRH-1 promotes defense through antiviral RNA interference, but less is known about its role in regulating transcription. Here we describe a role for drh-1 in directing a transcriptional response in C. elegans called the Intracellular Pathogen Response (IPR), which is associated with increased pathogen resistance. The IPR includes a set of genes induced by diverse stimuli including intracellular infection and proteotoxic stress. Previous work suggested that the proteotoxic stress caused by intracellular infections might be the common trigger of the IPR, but here we demonstrate that different stimuli act through distinct pathways. Specifically, we demonstrate that DRH-1/RIG-I is required for inducing the IPR in response to Orsay virus infection, but not in response to other triggers like microsporidian infection or proteotoxic stress. Furthermore, drh-1 appears to be acting independently of its known role in RNAi. Interestingly, expression of the replication competent Orsay virus RNA1 segment alone is sufficient to induce most of the IPR genes in a manner dependent on RNA dependent RNA polymerase activity and on drh-1. Altogether, these results suggest that DRH-1 is a pattern-recognition receptor that detects viral replication products to activate the IPR stress/immune program in C. elegans.\\n\\nImportanceC. elegans lacks homologs of most mammalian pattern recognition receptors, and how nematodes detect pathogens is poorly understood. We show that the C. elegans RIG-I homolog drh-1 mediates induction of the Intracellular Pathogen Response (IPR), a novel transcriptional defense program, in response to infection by the natural C. elegans viral pathogen Orsay virus. drh-1 appears to act as a pattern-recognition receptor to induce the IPR transcriptional defense program by sensing the products of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity. Interestingly, this signaling role of drh-1 is separable from its previously known role in antiviral RNAi. In addition, we show that there are multiple host pathways for inducing the IPR, shedding light on the regulation of this novel transcriptional immune response.",

Our analyses showed very similar transcriptomic profiles for these closely related species in terms of functional annotation and relative abundance of gene ontology terms expressed. Analyses of expression profiles of Oophaga and available skin transcriptomes of cryptic anurans allowed us to propose possible mechanisms for the active sequestration of alkaloid-based chemical defenses and to highlight some genes that may be potentially involved in resistance mechanisms to avoid self-intoxication and skin coloration.

This response includes activation of the conserved transcription factor Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF-1), which binds Heat Shock Elements (HSEs) in the promoters of genes induced by heat shock (HS). The up-regulation of protein-coding genes (PCGs), such as Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) and cytoskeletal regulators, is critical for cellular survival during elevated temperatures. While the transcriptional response of PCGs to heat shock has been comprehensively analyzed in a variety of organisms, the effect of this stress on the expression of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) has not been systematically examined. Here we show that in Caenorhabditis elegans HS induces up- and down-regulation of specific ncRNAs from multiple classes, including miRNA, piRNA, lincRNA, pseudogene, and repeat elements. Moreover, some ncRNA genes appear to be direct targets of the HSR, as they contain HSF-1 bound HSEs in their promoters and their expression is regulated by this factor during HS. These results demonstrate that multiple ncRNA genes respond to HS, some as direct HSF-1 targets, providing new candidates that may contribute to organismal survival during this stress.",

    "abstract": "The teleost Astyanax mexicanus is extant in two readily available forms. One that lives in Mexican rivers and various convergent forms that live in nearby caves. These fish are born with eyes but in the cavefish they degenerate during development. It is known that the lens of cavefish undergoes apoptosis and that some cells in the neuroretina also die. It has not been described, however, if glia and various components of the neuroretina form before complete eye degeneration. Here we examined the development of the retina of the closest living ancestor that lives in the rivers and members of two lineages of cavefish. We report that although the neuroretina is smaller and more compact, it has all cell types and layers including amacrine cells and Muller glia. While various makers for photoreceptors are present in the cavefish inner segments, the outer segments of the photoreceptors in cavefish are missing from the earliest stages examined. This shows that the machinery for visual transducing discs might still be present but not organized in one part of the cell. It is interesting to note that the deficiencies in Astyanax cavefish resemble retinal diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa.",

    "abstract": "Studying transitions in and out of the altered state of consciousness caused by intravenous (IV) N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT - a fast-acting tryptamine psychedelic) offers a safe and powerful means of advancing knowledge on the neurobiology of conscious states. Here we sought to investigate the effects of IV DMT on the power spectrum and signal diversity of human brain activity (6 female, 7 male) recorded via multivariate EEG, and plot relationships between subjective experience, brain activity and drug plasma concentrations across time. Compared with placebo, DMT markedly reduced oscillatory power in the alpha and beta bands and robustly increased spontaneous signal diversity. Time-referenced analyses revealed close relationships between changes in various aspects of subjective experience and changes in brain activity. Importantly, the emergence of oscillatory activity within the delta and theta frequency bands was found to correlate with the peak of the experience, and particularly its eyes-closed visual component. These findings highlight marked changes in oscillatory activity and signal diversity with DMT that parallel broad and specific components of the relevant subjective experience and thus further our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of immersive states of consciousness.",

    "abstract": "A central issue in reinforcement learning and decision-making is whether to exploit knowledge of reward values, or to explore novel options. Although it is widely hypothesized that dopamine neurotransmission plays a key role in regulating this balance, causal evidence for a role of dopamine in human exploration is still lacking. Here, we use a combination of computational modeling, pharmacological intervention and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test for a causal effect of dopamine transmission on the exploration-exploitation trade-off in humans. 31 healthy male subjects performed a restless four-armed bandit task in a within-subjects design under three drug conditions: 150mg of the dopamine precursor L-dopa, 2mg of the D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol, and placebo. In all conditions, choice behavior was best explained by an extension of an established Bayesian learning model accounting for perseveration, uncertainty-based exploration and random exploration. Uncertainty-based exploration was attenuated under L-dopa compared to placebo and haloperidol. There was no evidence for a modulation of prediction error signaling or categorical effects of exploration/exploitation under L-dopa, whereas model-based fMRI revealed that L-dopa attenuated neural representations of overall uncertainty in insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Our results highlight the computational role of these regions in exploration and suggest that dopamine modulates exploration by modulating how this circuit tracks accumulating uncertainty during decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Neuropsychological and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence suggests that the ability to vividly remember our personal past, and imagine future scenarios, involves two closely connected regions: the hippocampus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Despite evidence of a direct anatomical connection from hippocampus to vmPFC, it is unknown whether hippocampal-vmPFC structural connectivity supports both past and future-oriented episodic thinking. To address this, we applied diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) and a novel deterministic tractography protocol to reconstruct distinct subdivisions of the fornix previously detected in axonal tracer studies, namely pre-commissural (connecting the hippocampus to vmPFC) and post-commissural (linking the hippocampus and medial diencephalon) fornix, in a group of healthy young adult humans who undertook an adapted past-future autobiographical interview. As predicted, we found that inter-individual differences in pre-commissural - but not post-commissural - fornix microstructure (fractional anisotropy) was significantly correlated with the episodic richness of both past and future autobiographical narratives. Notably, these results remained significant when controlling for both non-episodic narrative content and grey matter volumes of the hippocampus and vmPFC. This study provides novel evidence that reconstructing events from ones personal past, and constructing possible future events, involves a distinct, structurally-instantiated hippocampal-vmPFC pathway.\n\nSignificance StatementA novel anatomically-guided protocol that allows the pre-commissural and post-commissural fornix fibers to be separately reconstructed in vivo (Christiansen et al., 2016) was applied to reconstruct the pre-commissural subdivision of the white matter fornix tract (anatomically linking the hippocampal formation to the vmPFC) and investigate its contribution to episodic memory and future simulation. We demonstrated that the amount of episodic details contained in past and future narratives, collected via an adapted autobiographical interview, was positively correlated with pre-, but not post-, commissural fornix microstructure. These findings highlight how inter-individual variation in the pre-commissural subdivision of the fornix underpins the construction of self-reflective, contextual events - for both the past and future.",

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, there has been a robust debate in decision neuroscience and psychology about what mechanism governs the time course of decision making. Historically, the most prominent hypothesis is that neural architectures accumulate information over time until some threshold is met, the so-called Evidence Accumulation hypothesis. However, most applications of this theory rely on simplifying assumptions, belying a number of potential complexities. Is changing stimulus information perceived and processed in an independent manner or is there a relative component? Does urgency play a role? What about evidence leakage? Although the latter questions have been the subject of recent investigations, most studies to date have been piecemeal in nature, addressing one aspect of the decision process or another. Here we develop a modeling framework, an extension of the Urgency Gating Model, in conjunction with a changing information experimental paradigm to simultaneously probe these aspects of the decision process. Using state-of-the-art Bayesian methods to perform parameter-based inference, we find that 1) information processing is relative with early information influencing the perception of late information, 2) time varying urgency and evidence accumulation are of roughly equal importance in the decision process, and 3) leakage is present with a time scale of ~200-250ms. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study to utilize a changing information paradigm to jointly and quantitatively estimate the temporal dynamics of human decision-making.",

    "abstract": "We previously demonstrated that maize (Zea mays) locus very oil yellow1 (vey1) encodes a putative cis-regulatory expression polymorphism at the magnesium chelatase subunit I gene (aka oil yellow1) that strongly modifies the chlorophyll content of the semi-dominant Oy1-N1989 mutants. The vey1 allele of Mo17 inbred line reduces chlorophyll content in the mutants leading to reduced photosynthetic output. Oy1-N1989 mutants in B73 reached reproductive maturity four days later than wild-type siblings. Enhancement of Oy1-N1989 by the Mo17 allele at the vey1 QTL delayed maturity further, resulting in detection of a flowering time QTL in two bi-parental mapping populations crossed to Oy1-N1989. The near isogenic lines of B73 harboring the vey1 allele from Mo17 delayed flowering of Oy1-N1989 mutants by twelve days. Just as previously observed for chlorophyll content, vey1 had no effect on reproductive maturity in the absence of the Oy1-N1989 allele. Loss of chlorophyll biosynthesis in Oy1-N1989 mutants and enhancement by vey1 reduced CO2 assimilation. We attempted to separate the effects of photosynthesis on the induction of flowering from a possible impact of chlorophyll metabolites and retrograde signaling by manually reducing leaf area. Removal of leaves, independent of the Oy1-N1989 mutant, delayed flowering but surprisingly reduced chlorophyll contents of emerging leaves. Thus, defoliation did not completely separate the identity of the signal(s) that regulates flowering time from changes in chlorophyll content in the foliage. These findings illustrate the necessity to explore the linkage between metabolism and the mechanisms that connect it to flowering time regulation.",

    "abstract": "Phosphorus (P) is an essential plant macronutrient vital to fundamental metabolic processes. Plant-available P is low in most soils, making it a frequent limiter of growth. Declining P reserves for fertilizer production exasperates this agricultural challenge. Plants modulate complex responses to fluctuating P levels via global transcriptional regulatory networks. Although chromatin structure plays a substantial role in controlling gene expression, the chromatin dynamics involved in regulating P homeostasis have not been determined. Here we define distinct chromatin states across the rice genome by integrating multiple aspects of chromatin structure, including the H2A.Z histone variant, H3K4me3 modification, and nucleosome positioning. In response to P starvation, 40% of all protein-coding genes exhibit a transition from one chromatin state to another at their transcription start site. Several of these transitions are enriched in subsets of genes differentially expressed by P deficiency. The most prominent subset supports the presence of a coordinated signaling network that targets cell wall structure and is regulated in part via a decrease of H3K4me3 at the transcription start site. The P-starvation induced chromatin dynamics and correlated genes identified here will aid in enhancing P-use efficiency in crop plants, benefitting global agriculture.\\n\\nOne sentence summaryCombining data for three components of chromatin structure from control and phosphate-starved rice shoots reveals specific chromatin state transitions that correlate with subsets of functionally distinct differentially-expressed genes.",

Although the manipulation of many genes could improve plant performance under either of these stresses, few genes have reported that could improve both pathogen resistance and saline-alkali stress tolerance. In this study, we identified a new chitinase gene CHITINASE 2 (LcCHI2) that encodes a class II chitinase from a Chinese wildrye (Leymus Chinensis), which grows naturally on alkaline-sodic soil. Overexpression of LcCHI2 increased chitinase activity in transgenic plants. The transgenic tobacco and maize exhibited improved pathogen resistance and enhanced both neutral salt and alkaline salt stress tolerance. Overexpression of LcCHI2 reduced sodium (Na+) accumulation, malondialdehyde content and relative electrical conductivity in transgenic tobacco under salt stress. In addition, the transgenic tobacco showed diminished lesion against bacterial and fungal pathogen challenge, suggesting an improved disease resistance. Similar improved performance was also observed in LcCHI2-overexpressed maize under both pathogen and salt stresses. It is worth noting that this genetic manipulation does not impair the growth and yield of transgenic tobacco and maize under normal cultivation condition. Apparently, application of LcCHI2 provides a new train of thought for genetically engineering saline-alkali and pathogen resistant crops of both dicots and monocots.",

    "abstract": "Cuscuta species (dodders) are agriculturally destructive parasitic angiosperms. These parasitic plants use haustoria as physiological bridges to extract nutrients and water from hosts. Cuscuta campestris has a broad host range and wide geographical distribution. While some wild tomato relatives are resistant, cultivated tomatoes are generally susceptible to C. campestris infestations. However, some specific Heinz tomato hybrid cultivars exhibit resistance to dodders in the field, but their defense mechanism was unknown. Here, we discovered that the stem cortex in these resistant lines responds with local lignification upon C. campestris attachment, preventing parasite entry into the host. LIF1 (Lignin Induction Factor 1, an AP2-like transcription factor), SlMYB55, and CuRLR1 (Cuscuta R-gene for Lignin-based Resistance 1, a CC-NBS-LRR) are identified as crucial factors conferring host resistance by regulating lignification. SlWRKY16 is upregulated upon C. campestris infestation and acts as a negative regulator of LIF1 function. Intriguingly, CuRLR1 may play a role in signaling or function as a receptor for receiving Cuscuta signals or effectors to regulate lignification-based resistance. In summary, these four regulators control the lignin-based resistance response, preventing C. campestris from parasitizing these resistant tomatoes. This discovery provides a foundation for investigating multilayer resistance against Cuscuta species and has potential for application in other essential crops attacked by parasitic plants.\n\nOne-sentence summaryFour key regulators confer lignin accumulation in the tomato stem cortex to block C. campestris host penetration upon infection.",

    "abstract": "Centromeres are rapidly evolving across eukaryotes, despite performing a conserved function to ensure high fidelity chromosome segregation. CENP-A chromatin is a hallmark of a functional centromere in most organisms. Due to its critical role in kinetochore architecture, the loss of CENP-A is tolerated in only a few organisms, many of which possess holocentric chromosomes. Here, we characterize the consequence of the loss of CENP-A in the fungal kingdom. Mucor circinelloides, an opportunistic human pathogen, lacks CENP-A along with the evolutionarily conserved CENP-C, but assembles a monocentric chromosome with a localized kinetochore complex throughout the cell cycle. Mis12 and Dsn1, two conserved kinetochore proteins were found to bind nine short overlapping regions, each comprising an [~]200-bp AT-rich sequence followed by a centromere-specific conserved motif that echoes the structure of budding yeast point centromeres. Resembling fungal regional centromeres, these core centromere regions are embedded in large genomic expanses devoid of genes yet marked by Grem-LINE1s, a novel retrotransposable element silenced by the Dicer-dependent RNAi pathway. Our results suggest that these hybrid features of point and regional centromeres arose from the absence of CENP-A, thus defining novel mosaic centromeres in this early-diverging fungus.",

    "abstract": "The spatial mapping of localized events in brain activity critically depends on the correct identification of the pattern signatures associated with those events. For instance, in the context of epilepsy research, a number of different electrophysiological patterns have been associated with epileptogenic activity. Motivated by the need to define automated seizure focus detectors, we propose a novel data-driven algorithm for the spatial identification of localized events that is based on the following rationale: the distribution of emerging oscillations during confined events across all recording sites is highly non-uniform and can be mapped using a spatial entropy function. By applying this principle to EEG recording obtained from 67 distinct seizure epochs, our method successfully identified the seizure focus on a group of ten drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy patients (average sensitivity: 0.94, average specificity: 0.90) together with its characteristic electrophysiological pattern signature. Cross-validation of the method outputs with postresective information revealed the consistency of our findings in long follow-up seizure-free patients. Overall, our methodology provides a reliable computational procedure that might be used as in both experimental and clinical domains to identify the neural populations undergoing an emerging functional or pathological transition.\\n\\nConflict of interestsThe authors declare no competing financial interests.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe ability to discriminate spikes that encode a particular stimulus from spikes produced by background activity is essential for reliable information processing in the brain. We describe how synaptic short-term plasticity (STP) modulates the output of presynaptic populations as a function of the distribution of the spiking activity and find a strong relationship between STP features and sparseness of the population code, which could solve the discrimination problem. Furthermore, we show that feedforward excitation followed by inhibition (FF-EI), combined with target-dependent STP, promote substantial increase in the signal gain even for considerable deviations from the optimal conditions, granting robustness to this mechanism. A simulated neuron driven by a spiking FF-EI network is reliably modulated as predicted by a rate analysis and inherits the ability to differentiate sparse signals from dense background activity changes of the same magnitude, even at very low signal-to-noise conditions. We propose that the STP-based distribution discrimination is likely a latent function in several regions such as the cerebellum and the hippocampus.",

    "abstract": "We developed a glaucoma-on-a-chip (GOC) model to evaluate the viability of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) against high pressure and the potential effect of neuroprotection. A three-layered chip consisting of interconnecting microchannels and culture wells was designed based on simulation of physical parameters. The chip layers were fabricated from poly-methyl methacrylate sheets. Multiple inlet ports allow culture media and gas into the wells under elevated hydrostatic pressure (EHP). The bottom surface of the wells was modified by air plasma and coated with different membranes to model an extracellular microenvironment. The SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line served as model cells to determine the best supporting membrane which was revealed to be PDL/laminin. Thereafter, the study experiments were performed using RGCs obtained from postnatal 5-7 Wistar rats purified by magnetic assisted cell sorting. Flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry assays demonstrated 70% purification for RGCs. The cultured RGCs were exposed to normal (15 mmHg) or elevated pressure (33 mmHg) for 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours, with and without adding brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or a novel BDNF mimetic (RNYK). RGC survival rates were 85, 78, 70, 67 and 61 percent under normal pressure versus 40, 22, 18, 12 and 10 percent under high pressure at 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours, respectively (P <0.0001). BDNF and RNYK treatments induced separately an approximate two-fold decrease in the rate of RGC death under both normal and elevated pressures (p <0.01 to 0.0001). This GOC model recapitulated the effects of elevated pressure during relatively short time periods and demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of BDNF and RNYK.",

    "abstract": "We studied the fine temporal structure of spiking patterns of groups of up to 100 simultaneously recorded units in the prefrontal cortex of monkeys performing a visual discrimination task. We characterized the vocabulary of population activity patterns using 10 ms time bins and found that different sets of population activity patterns (codebooks) are used in different task epochs and that spiking correlations between units play a large role in defining those codebooks. Models that ignore those correlations fail to capture the population codebooks in all task epochs. Further, we show that temporal sequences of population activity patterns have strong history-dependence and are governed by different transition probabilities between patterns and different correlation time scales, in the different task epochs, suggesting different computational dynamics governing each epoch. Together, the large impact of spatial and temporal correlations on the dynamics of the population code makes the observed sequences of activity patterns many orders of magnitude more likely to appear than predicted by models that ignore these correlations and rely only on the population rates. Surprisingly, however, models that ignore these correlations perform quite well for decoding behavior from population responses. The difference of encoding and decoding complexity of the neural codebook suggests that one of the goals of the complex encoding scheme in the prefrontal cortex is to accommodate simple decoders that do not have to learn correlations.",

However, applications of this approach are currently held back by the availability of large and suitably annotated training datasets. Early training datasets targeted arabidopsis or tobacco. The morphology of these plants quite different from that of grass species like maize. Two sets of maize training data, one real-world and one synthetic were generated and annotated for late vegetative stage maize plants using leaf count as a model trait. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on entirely synthetic data provided predictive power for scoring leaf number in real-world images. This power was less than CNNs trained with equal numbers of real-world images, however, in some cases CNNs trained with larger numbers of synthetic images outperformed CNNs trained with smaller numbers of real-world images. When real-world training images were scarce, augmenting real-world training data with synthetic data provided improved prediction accuracy. Quantifying leaf number over time can provide insight into plant growth rates and stress responses, and can help to parameterize crop growth models. The approaches and annotated training data described here may help future efforts to develop accurate leaf counting algorithms for maize.",

Yet turning represents a fundamental dilemma based in rotational dynamics: the torque powering a turn is favored by an expanded body configuration, yet minimizing the resistance to a turn (the moment of inertia) is favored by a contracted body configuration. How do animals balance these opposing demands to achieve high maneuverability? By noninvasively measuring fluid and body motions, we found that both jellyfish (Aurelia aurita) and fish (Danio rerio) initially maximized torque using previously undescribed, rapid body movements. Both species then minimized resistance to turning by bending their bodies to reduce their moment of inertia. Use of this sequential solution by such distantly related animals as an invertebrate and a vertebrate suggests strong selection for these turning dynamics that may extend to other swimmers and inform future vehicle designs.",

However, cellular responses to in vivo extracellular matrix (ECM), a hydrogel of proteins (mainly collagen) with various elasticity and a nanometer-to micrometer-scale topography, remain to be elucidated owing to a lack of substrate that provides such complex cues. This study introduces novel collagen hydrogels that can combine, for the first time, elastic, topographic, and compositional cues that recapitulate native ECM. A simple and reagent-free method based on radiation crosslinking alters ECM-derived collagen solutions into hydrogels with a well-defined and tunable elastic modulus covering the broad range of soft tissues (1-236 kPa) and microtopographies while ensuring intrinsic biological functionality of collagen. These collagen hydrogels enabled investigating cell responses to soft topographic cues such as those encountered in vivo, revealing that topography overrides the elasticity and structurally constrains cell morphology by controlling actin cytoskeleton organization. The collagen hydrogels not only reduce in vivo and in vitro behavioral disparity of cells by mimicking native ECM but also facilitate the design of artificial ECM to control cell function and fate in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.",

By connecting human microphysiological systems of the gut, liver and circulating Treg/Th17 cells, we modeled progression of ulcerative colitis (UC) ex vivo. We show that microbiome-derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) may either improve or worsen disease severity, depending on the activation state of CD4 T cells. Employing multiomics, we found SCFA increased production of ketone bodies, glycolysis and lipogenesis, while markedly reducing innate immune activation of the UC gut. However, during acute T cell-mediated inflammation, SCFA exacerbated CD4+ T cell effector function, partially through metabolic reprograming, leading to gut barrier disruption and hepatic injury. These paradoxical findings underscore the emerging utility of human physiomimetic technology in combination with systems immunology to study causality and the fundamental entanglement of immunity, metabolism and tissue homeostasis.\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=87 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/706812v2_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (31K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10006b0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b7344eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cb0c06org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1826e38_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Measuring the correctness of a phylogenetic tree is one of the most fundamental tasks in phylogenetic study. A large number of methods have been proposed to measure the correctness of a tree. Such methods completely depend on the reference tree and they compute the distance between reference the tree and the target tree. But it is very difficult to obtain a precise and an accurate reference tree for a selected dataset. As a result, the existing methods for comparing the phylogenetic trees can behave unexpectedly in various scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a scoring function, called the Deformity Index, to measure the correctness of a tree based on the biological knowledge of the clades. The strength of our proposed method is that it does not consider any reference tree. We have also investigated the range and the distributions of the different modules of Deformity Index. Furthermore, we perform different goodness of fit tests to understand its cumulative distribution. We have also examined in detail the robustness as well as the scalability of our measure by different statistical tests under the Yule and the uniform models. Moreover, we show that our proposed scoring function can overcome the limitations of the conventional methods of tree comparing by experimenting on different biological datasets.",

LRRK2 is also involved in the degradation of pathological alpha-synuclein, with pathogenic mutations precipitating neuropathology in cellular and animal models of PD, and most LRRK2 familial cases manifesting with Lewy neuropathology. Defects in autophagic processing and lysosomal degradation of alpha-synuclein have been postulated to underlie its accumulation and onset of neuropathology. Thus, it is critical to reconcile these independent pieces of information to obtain a comprehensive knowledge on LRRK2-associated pathology that could also be generalized to the idiopathic disease.\\n\\nHere, we report a focused investigation on the role of PD-causing G2019S-LRRK2 in the autophagy-lysosome pathway in a recombinant cell line model. Initially, we evaluated the effect of LRRK2 expression on autophagy-related transcriptome. Then, we found that G2019S-LRRK2 leads to accumulation of autophagosomes with no net effect on autophagy induction. This is linked to abnormalities in lysosome morphology and proteolytic activity that are associated with a decrease in the successful formation of autolysosomes. Despite some of these features being shared by WT-LRRK2, alpha-synuclein intracellular inclusions are specifically found in G2019S-LRRK2 cells. Pharmacological kinase inhibition is capable of rescuing defects in the autophagy-lysosome pathway and reducing the number of inclusions. Notably, this effect is prevented by upstream blockade of autophagosome-lysosome fusion events, highlighting this step of the process as critical for alpha-synuclein clearance.",

    "abstract": "Precise cellular organizations are required for the function of many organs and tissues. It is often unclear, however, how such precise patterns emerge during development. The mammalian hearing organ, the organ of Corti, consists of a remarkably organized pattern of four rows of hair cells (HCs) interspersed by non-sensory supporting cells (SCs). This checkerboard-like pattern of HCs and SCs emerges from a disordered epithelium over several days, yet the transition to an ordered cellular pattern is not well understood. Using a combination of quantitative morphological analysis and time-lapse imaging of mouse cochlear explants, we show here that patterning of the organ of Corti involves dynamic reorganizations that include lateral shear motion, cell intercalations, and delaminations. A mathematical model, where tissue morphology is described in terms of the mechanical forces that act on cells and cellular junctions, suggests that global shear on HCs and local repulsion between HCs are sufficient to drive the tissue into the final checkerboard-like pattern. Our findings suggest that precise patterns can emerge during development from reorganization processes, driven by a combination of global and local forces in a process analogous to shear-induced crystallization.",

    "abstract": "Public attention and interest in the fate of endangered species is a crucial prerequisite for effective conservation programs. Societal awareness and values will largely determine whether conservation initiatives receive necessary support and lead to adequate policy change. Using text data mining, we assessed general public attention toward climate change and biological invasions, which represent two key threats for endangered amphibian, reptile, bird and mammal species in three European countries (France, Germany and the United Kingdom). Our analysis revealed that public attention patterns differed among species groups and countries but was globally higher for climate change than for biological invasions. Both threats received better recognition in threatened than in non-threatened species, as well as in native species than in species from other countries and regions. The relative level of attention toward the two threats corresponded well with the listing of the threats and their severity within the IUCN Red List. We conclude that more efficient communication regarding the threat from biological invasions should be developed, and that conservation practitioners should take advantage of the existing attention toward the threat of climate change.",

    "abstract": "One of the most widespread consequences of climate change is the disruption of trees phenological cycles. The extent to which tree phenology varies with local climate is largely genetically determined, and while a combination of temperature and photoperiodic cues are typically found to trigger bud burst (BB) in spring, it has proven harder to identify the main cues driving leaf senescence (LS) in autumn. We used 925 individual field-observations of BB and LS from six Fagus sylvatica provenances, covering the range of environmental conditions found across the species distribution, to: (i) estimate the dates of BB and LS of these provenances; (ii) assess the main drivers of LS; and (iii) predict the likely variation in the growing season length (GSL; defined by BB and LS timing) across populations under current and future climate scenarios. To this end, we first calibrated linear mixed-effects models for LS as a function of temperature, insolation and BB date. Secondly, we calculated the GSL for each provenance as the number of days between BB and LS. We found that: i) there were larger differences among provenances in the date of LS than in the date of BB; ii) the temperature through September, October and November was the main determinant of LS in beech, although covariation of temperature with daily insolation and precipitation-related variables suggests that all three variables may affect LS timing; and iii) GSL was predicted to increase in northern beech provenances and to shrink in populations from the core and the southern range under climate change. Consequently, the large differences in GSL across beech range in the present climate are likely to decrease under future climates where rising temperatures will alter the relationship between BB and LS, with northern populations increasing productivity by extending their growing season to take advantage of warmer conditions.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of antiviral genes has been fundamentally shaped by antagonistic interactions with ancestral viruses. The AID/APOBEC family genes (AID and APOBEC1-4) encode cellular cytosine deaminases that target nucleic acids and catalyze C-to-U mutations. In the case of retroviral replication, APOBEC3 proteins induce C-to-U mutations in minus-stranded viral DNA, which results in G-to-A mutations in the viral genome. Previous studies have indicated that the expansion and rapid evolution of mammalian APOBEC3 genes has been driven by an arms race with retroviral parasites, but this has not been thoroughly investigated. Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are retrotransposons originated from ancient retroviral infections. These sequences sometimes bear the hallmarks of APOBEC3-mediated mutations, and therefore serve as a record of the ancient conflict between retroviruses and APOBEC3 genes. Here we systematically investigated the sequences of ERVs and APOBEC3 genes in mammals to reconstruct details of the evolutionary conflict between them. We identified 1,420 AID/APOBEC family genes in a comprehensive screen of mammalian genome. Of the AID/APOBEC family genes, APOBEC3 genes have been selectively amplified in mammalian genomes and disclose evidence of strong positive selection - whereas the catalytic domain was highly conserved across species, the structure loop 7, which recognizes viral DNA/RNA substrates, was shown to be evolving under strong positive selection. Although APOBEC3 genes have been amplified by tandem gene duplication in most mammalian lineages, the retrotransposition-mediated gene amplification was found in several mammals including New World monkeys and prosimian primates. Comparative analysis revealed that G-to-A mutations are accumulated in ERVs, and that the G-to-A mutation signatures on ERVs is concordant with the target preferences of APOBEC3 proteins. Importantly, the number of APOBEC3 genes was significantly correlated with the frequency of G-to-A mutations in ERVs, suggesting that the amplification of APOBEC3 genes led to stronger attacks on ERVs and/or their ancestral retroviruses by APOBEC3 proteins. Furthermore, the numbers of APOBEC3 genes and ERVs in mammalian genomes were positively correlated, and in primates, the timings of APOBEC3 gene amplification was concordant with that of ERV invasions. Our findings suggest that conflict with ancient retroviruses was a major selective pressure driving the rapid evolution of APOBEC3 genes in mammals.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenomic structural variants (SVs) can affect many genes and regulatory elements. Therefore, the molecular mechanisms driving the phenotypes of patients with multiple congenital abnormalities and/or intellectual disability carrying de novo SVs are frequently unknown.\\n\\nResultsWe applied a combination of systematic experimental and bioinformatic methods to improve the molecular diagnosis of 39 patients with de novo SVs and an inconclusive diagnosis after regular genetic testing. In seven of these cases (18%) whole genome sequencing analysis detected disease-relevant complexities of the SVs missed in routine microarray-based analyses. We developed a computational tool to predict effects on genes directly affected by SVs and on genes indirectly affected due to changes in chromatin organization and impact on regulatory mechanisms. By combining these functional predictions with extensive phenotype information, candidate driver genes were identified in 16/39 (41%) patients. In eight cases evidence was found for involvement of multiple candidate drivers contributing to different parts of the phenotypes. Subsequently, we applied this computational method to a collection of 382 patients with previously detected and classified de novo SVs and identified candidate driver genes in 210 cases (54%), including 32 cases whose SVs were previously not classified as pathogenic. Pathogenic positional effects were predicted in 25% of the cases with balanced SVs and in 8% of the cases with copy number variants.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results show that driver gene prioritization based on integrative analysis of WGS data with phenotype association and chromatin organization datasets can improve the molecular diagnosis of patients with de novo SVs.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging faces the daunting challenge of multiple testing - an instance of multiplicity - that is associated with two other issues to some extent: low inference efficiency and poor reproducibility. Typically, the same statistical model is applied to each spatial unit independently in the approach of massively univariate modeling. In dealing with multiplicity, the general strategy employed in the field is the same regardless of the specifics: trust the local \\\"unbiased\\\" effect estimates while adjusting the extent of statistical evidence at the global level. However, in this approach, modeling efficiency is compromised because each spatial unit (e.g., voxel, region, matrix element) is treated as an isolated and independent entity during massively univariate modeling. In addition, the required step of multiple testing \\\"correction\\\" by taking into consideration spatial relatedness, or neighborhood leverage, can only partly recoup statistical efficiency, resulting in potentially excessive penalization as well as arbitrariness due to thresholding procedures. Moreover, the assigned statistical evidence at the global level heavily relies on the data space (whole brain or a small volume). The present paper reviews how Steins paradox (1956) motivates a Bayesian multilevel (BML) approach that, rather than fighting multiplicity, embraces it to our advantage through a global calibration process among spatial units. Global calibration is accomplished via a Gaussian distribution for the cross-region effects whose properties are not a priori specified, but a posteriori determined by the data at hand through the BML model. Our framework therefore incorporates multiplicity as integral to the modeling structure, not a separate correction step. By turning multiplicity into a strength, we aim to achieve five goals: 1) improve model efficiency with higher predictive accuracy, 2) control the errors of incorrect magnitude and incorrect sign, 3) validate each model relative to competing candidates, 4) reduce the reliance and sensitivity on the choice of data space, and 5) encourage full results reporting. Our modeling proposal reverberates with recent proposals to eliminate the dichotomization of statistical evidence (\\\"significant\\\" vs. \\\"non-significant\\\"), to improve the interpretability of study findings, as well as to promote reporting the full gamut of results (not only \\\"significant\\\" ones), thereby enhancing research transparency and reproducibility.",

    "abstract": "Ischemic brain injury represents insufficient oxygen supply to the brain and further damage occurs upon reoxygenation due to elevated intracellular levels excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and subsequent production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which has long been related to neuronal cell death of hippocampus brain region. Previously, using cell biological assay and transcriptomics analysis we reported that naturally occurring phytosterol Stigmasterol (ST) promotes brain development and function through the enhancement of neuronal cytoarchitectural complexity and functional maturation in rat hippocampal neurons by induction of immediate early genes (IEGs). In the present study we investigated the STs role in neuroprotection and found that ST also dose-dependently increased the neuronal viability in hypoxia reoxygenation (H/R) induced injury at hippocampal culture. ST, at an optimal concentration of 20 M, significantly reduced the transport of vesicular glutamate (VGULT1), synaptic vesicle pool size, expression of GluN2B, rate of ROS formation (DCFDA) but restore mitochondrial membrane potential (JC1) and DNA fragmentation (H2AX) against H/R induced injury. More interestingly, ST also significantly induces the expression of autophagy marker protein LC3BII and the adaptor protein P62 but not HSC70 which indicates STs capability of induction of chaperon independent autophagy at H/R treated cultures. Furthermore densitometric analysis reveals ST also significantly increases PINK1 (PTEN induced protein kinase 1) expression therefore, indicates its role in mitophagy. In addition, molecular dynamic simulations study indicates that ST bind to LXR{beta} and forms hydrogen bonds with ASN239, GLU281, ARG319, THR316, SER278, ASN239 and SER278 residues at high occupancy with GLU281(20.21%) and ARG319 (21.04%,) residues, which is necessary for sterol binding to the LXR{beta}. Taken together these findings suggest that neuroprotective effect of ST might be associated with anti-excitatory and anti-oxidative actions on CNS neurons and could be a promising drug candidate for the treatment or prevention of ischemic stroke related neurological disorders.",

    "abstract": "Studying dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) has been the focus of many studies in recent years. The most commonly used estimator for dFC uses a sliding window in combination with a connectivity estimator such as Pearson correlation. Here, we propose a new approach to estimate connectivity while preserving its full frequency range and subsequently examine both static and dynamic connectivity in one unified approach. This approach which we call filter banked connectivity (FBC), implements frequency tiling directly in the connectivity domain contrary to other studies where frequency tiling is done in the activity domain. This leads to more accurate modeling, and a unified approach to capture connectivity ranging from static to highly dynamic, avoiding the need to pick a specific band as in a sliding window approach.\n\nFirst, we demonstrated that our proposed approach, can estimate connectivity at frequencies that sliding window approach fails. Next we evaluated the ability of the approach to identify group differences by using the FBC approach to estimate dFNC in a resting fMRI data set including schizophrenia patients (SZ, n=151) and typical controls (TC, n=163). To summarize the results, we used k-means to cluster the FBC values into different clusters. Some states showed very weak low frequency strength and as such SWPC was not well suited to capture them. Additionally, we found that SZs tend to spend more time in states exhibiting higher frequencies and engaging the default mode network and its anticorrelations with other networks compared to TCs which spent more time in lower frequency states which primarily includes strong intercorrelations within the sensorimotor domains. In summary, the proposed approach offers a novel way to estimate connectivity while unifying static and dynamic connectivity analyses and can provide additional otherwise missed information about the frequency profile of connectivity patterns.",

Cell dissociation allows for the isolation of a desired cell type, yet the complexity that distinguishes the nervous system is often lost as a result.

Nodose ganglia neurons have been extensively studied both in dissociated form and acutely in slice format. However, methods to culture long-term ex vivo have not been established.\\n\\nNew MethodWe developed a simple method to culture nodose ganglia neurons from neonatal pigs long-term in ex vivo format using an in-house media formulation derived from commercially available components.\\n\\nResultsCultures were viable for approximately 12 months. mRNA expression for nestin, a marker of neural progenitor cells, was stable across time.

    "abstract": "The excess of 15-30 Hz ({beta}-band) oscillations in the basal ganglia is one of the key signatures of Parkinsons disease (PD). The STN-GPe network is integral to generation and modulation of {beta} band oscillations in basal ganglia. However, the role of changes in the firing rates and spike bursting of STN and GPe neurons in shaping these oscillations has remained unclear. In order to uncouple their effects, we studied the dynamics of STN-GPe network using numerical simulations. In particular, we used a neuron model, in which firing rates and spike bursting can be independently controlled. Using this model, we found that while STN firing rate is predictive of oscillations but GPe firing rate is not. The effect of spike bursting in STN and GPe neurons was state-dependent. That is, only when the network was operating in a state close to the border of oscillatory and non-oscillatory regimes, spike bursting had a qualitative effect on the {beta} band oscillations. In these network states, an increase in GPe bursting enhanced the oscillations whereas an equivalent proportion of spike bursting in STN suppressed the oscillations. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the transient {beta} bursts and how duration and power of {beta} band oscillations may be controlled by an interplay of GPe and STN firing rates and spike bursts.\n\nAuthor summaryThe STN-GPe network undergoes a change in firing rates as well as increased bursting during excessive {beta} band oscillations during Parkinsons disease. In this work we uncouple their effects by using a novel neuron model and show that presence of oscillations is contingent on the increase in STN firing rates, however the effect of spike bursting on oscillations depends on the network state. In a network state on the border of oscillatory and non-oscillatory regime, GPe spike bursting strengthens oscillations. The effect of spike bursting in the STN depends on the proportion of GPe neurons bursting. These results suggest a mechanism underlying a transient {beta} band oscillation bursts often seen in experimental data.",

    "abstract": "Cortical development during childhood and adolescence has been characterised in recent years using metrics derived from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Changes in cortical thickness are greatest in the first two decades of life and recapitulate the genetic organisation of the cortex, highlighting the potential early impact of gene expression on differences in cortical architecture over the lifespan. It is important to further our understanding of the possible neurobiological mechanisms that underlie these changes as differences in cortical thickness may act as a potential phenotypic marker of several common neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders.\\n\\nIn this study, we combine MRI acquired from a large typically-developing childhood population (n=768) with comprehensive human gene expression databases to test the hypothesis that disrupted mechanisms common to neurodevelopmental disorders are encoded by genes expressed early in development and nested within those associated with typical cortical remodelling in childhood.\\n\\nWe find that differential rates of thinning across the developing cortex are associated with spatially-varying gradients of gene expression. Genes that are expressed highly in regions of accelerated thinning are expressed predominantly in cortical neurons, involved in synaptic remodeling, and associated with common cognitive and neurodevelopmental disorders. Further, we identify subsets of genes that are highly expressed in the prenatal period and jointly associated with both developmental cortical morphology and neurodevelopmental disorders.",

These interactions are found on many length scales, ranging from kilometer-scale animal range dynamics with selection against hybrids to micron-scale interactions between poison-secreting microbial populations. We find that the dynamical line tension at the interface between antagonistic organisms suppresses survival probabilities of small clonal clusters: the line tension introduces a critical cluster size that an organism with a selective advantage must achieve before deterministically spreading through the population. We calculate the survival probability as a function of selective advantage{delta} and antagonistic interaction strength{sigma} . Unlike a simple Darwinian selective advantage, the survival probability depends strongly on the spatial diffusion constant Ds of the strains when{sigma} > 0, with suppressed survival when both species are more motile. Finally, we study the survival probability of a single mutant cell at the frontier of a growing spherical cluster of cells, such as the surface of an avascular spherical tumor. Both the inflation and curvature of the frontier significantly enhance the survival probability by changing the critical size of the nucleating cell cluster.",

Compared to control DCs, antigen presentation by DCs that ectopically express CTLA4, PD1 and BTLA selective ligands (B7.1wa, PD-L1, and HVEM-CRD1 respectively) individually (mono-ligand DCs) or in combination (multi-ligand DCs) causes an inhibition of CD4+ T cell proliferation and pro-inflammatory cytokine response, as well as increase in Foxp3+ Treg frequency and immune regulatory cytokine production. Administration of self-antigen (mouse thyroglobulin; mTg) loaded multi-ligand DCs caused hyporesponsiveness to mTg challenge, suppression of autoantibody production, and amelioration of experimental autoimmune thyroiditis. Overall, this study shows that engineered DC-directed enhanced concurrent activation of multiple T cell coinhibitory pathways is an effective way to induce self-antigen specific T cell tolerance to suppress ongoing autoimmunity.",

    "abstract": "Generating appropriate motor commands is an essential brain function. To achieve proper motor control in diverse situations, predicting future states of the environment and body and modifying the prediction are indispensable. The internal model is a promising hypothesis about brain function for generating and modifying the prediction. Although several findings support the involvement of the cerebellum in the internal model, recent results support the influence of other related brain regions on the internal model. A representative example is the motor adaptation ability in Parkinsons disease (PD) patients. Although this ability provides some hints about how dopamine deficits affect the internal model, previous findings are inconsistent; some reported a deficit in the motor adaptation ability in PD patients, but others reported that the motor adaptation ability of PD patients is comparable to that of healthy controls. A possible factor causing this inconsistency is the difference in task settings, which yield different cognitive strategies in each study. Here, we demonstrate a larger, but not better, motor adaptation ability in PD patients than healthy controls while reducing the involvement of cognitive strategies and concentrating on implicit motor adaptation abilities. This study utilizes a smart-device-based experiment that enables motor adaptation experiments anytime and anywhere with less cognitive strategy involvement. The PD patients showed a significant response to insensible environmental changes, but the response was not necessarily suitable for adapting to the changes. Our findings support compensatory or paretic cerebellar functions in PD patients from the perspective of motor adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Models of evolution by natural selection often make the simplifying assumption that populations are infinitely large. In this infinite population limit, rare mutations that are selected against always go extinct, whereas in finite populations they can persist and even reach fixation. Nevertheless, for mutations of small phenotypic effect, it is widely believed that in sufficiently large populations, if selection opposes the invasion of rare mutants, then it also opposes their fixation. Here, we identify circumstances under which infinite-population models do or do not accurately predict evolutionary outcomes in large, finite populations. We show that there is no population size above which considering only invasion generally suffices: for any finite population size, there are situations in which selection opposes the invasion of mutations of arbitrarily small effect, but favours their fixation. This is not an unlikely limiting case; it can occur when fitness is a smooth function of the evolving trait, and when the selection process is biologically sensible. Nevertheless, there are circumstances under which opposition of invasion does imply opposition of fixation: in fact, for the n-player snowdrift game (a common model of cooperation) we identify sufficient conditions under which selection against rare mutants of small effect precludes their fixation--in sufficiently large populations--for any selection process. We also find conditions under which--no matter how large the population--the trait that fixes depends on the selection process, which is important because any particular selection process is only an approximation of reality.",

    "abstract": "Homing based gene drives (HGD) possess the potential to spread linked cargo genes into natural populations and are poised to revolutionize population control of animals. Given that host-encoded genes have been identified that are important for pathogen transmission, targeting these genes using guide RNAs as cargo genes linked to drives may provide a robust method to prevent transmission. However, effectiveness of the inclusion of additional guide RNAs that target separate host encoded genes has not been thoroughly explored. To test this approach, here we generated a split-HGD in Drosophila melanogaster that encoded a drive linked effector consisting of a second gRNA engineered to target a separate host encoded gene, which we term a gRNA-mediated effector (GME). This design enabled us to assess homing and knockout efficiencies of two target genes simultaneously, and also explore the timing and tissue specificity of Cas9 expression on cleavage/homing rates. We demonstrate that inclusion of a GME can result in high efficiency of disruption of its target gene during super-Mendelian propagation of split-HGD. However, maternal deposition and embryonic expression of Cas9 resulted in the generation of drive resistant alleles which can accumulate and limit the spread of such a drive. Alternative design principles are discussed that could mitigate the accumulation of resistance alleles while incorporating a GME.",

    "abstract": "ENCODE comprises thousands of functional genomics datasets, and the encyclopedia covers hundreds of cell types, providing a universal annotation for genome interpretation. However, for particular applications, it may be advantageous to use a customized annotation. Here, we develop such a custom annotation by leveraging advanced assays, such as eCLIP, Hi-C, and whole-genome STARR-seq on a number of data-rich ENCODE cell types. A key aspect of this annotation is comprehensive and experimentally derived networks of both transcription factors and RNA-binding proteins (TFs and RBPs). Cancer, a disease of system-wide dysregulation, is an ideal application for such a network-based annotation. Specifically, for cancer-associated cell types, we put regulators into hierarchies and measure their network change (rewiring) during oncogenesis. We also extensively survey TF-RBP crosstalk, highlighting how SUB1, a previously uncharacterized RBP, drives aberrant tumor expression and amplifies the effect of MYC, a well-known oncogenic TF. Furthermore, we show how our annotation allows us to place oncogenic transformations in the context of a broad cell space; here, many normal-to-tumor transitions move towards a stem-like state, while oncogene knockdowns show an opposing trend. Finally, we organize the resource into a coherent workflow to prioritize key elements and variants, in addition to regulators. We showcase the application of this prioritization to somatic burdening, cancer differential expression and GWAS. Targeted validations of the prioritized regulators, elements and variants using siRNA knockdowns, CRISPR-based editing, and luciferase assays demonstrate the value of the ENCODE resource.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo assess the association between DNA methylation and acute myocardial infarction, the predictive added value of the identified methylation marks, and the causality of those associations.\n\nApproach and ResultsWe conducted a case-control, two-stage, epigenome-wide association study on acute myocardial infarction (ndiscovery=391, nvalidation=204). DNA methylation was assessed using the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip (over 850,000 CpGs). DNA methylation was the exposure variable and myocardial infarction the outcome of interest. After a fixed-effects meta-analysis, 34 CpGs fulfilled Bonferroni significance. These findings were also analysed in two independent cohort studies (n[~]1,800 and n[~]2,500) with incident coronary (CHD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip was used in these two studies (over 480,000 CpGs) and only 12 of the 34 CpGs were available in those samples. Finally, we validated four of them in association with incident CHD: AHRR-mapping cg05575921, PTCD2-mapping cg25769469, intergenic cg21566642 and MPO-mapping cg04988978. The four CpGs were also associated with classical cardiovascular risk factors. A methylation risk score based on those CpGs did not improve the predictive capacity of the Framingham risk function. To assess the causal effects of those CpGs we performed Mendelian randomization analysis but only one metQTL could be identified and the results were not conclusive.\n\nConclusionsWe have identified 34 CpGs related to acute myocardial infarction. These loci highlight the relevance of smoking, lipid metabolism, and inflammation in the biological mechanisms related to myocardial infarction. Four were additionally associated with incident CHD and CVD but did not provide additional predictive information.",

Here we investigated the speed regulation of semi-tethered blue-bottle flies (Calliphora vomitoria) flying along an annular corridor in a magnetically levitated flight mill enclosed by two motorized cylindrical walls. We perturbed the flies retinal-image motion via spinning the cylindrical walls, generating bilaterally-averaged velocity perturbations from -0.3 to 0.3 m{middle dot}s-1. Flies compensated retinal-image velocity perturbations by adjusting airspeed up to 20%, thereby maintaining a relatively constant retinal-image velocity. When the retinal-image velocity perturbation became greater than [~]0.1 m{middle dot}s-1, the compensation weakened as airspeed plateaued, suggesting that flies were unable to further change airspeed. The compensation gain, i.e., the ratio of airspeed compensation and retinal-image velocity perturbation, depended on the spatial frequency of the grating patterns, being the largest at 12 m-1.",

Here, we have developed a statistical method ncells for calculating the number of cells required to detect a rare subpopulation in a homogeneous cell population for the given type I and II error. ncells defines power as the probability of separation of subpopulations which is calculated from three user-defined parameters: the proportion of rare subpopulation, proportion of up-regulated marker genes of the subpopulation, and levels of differential expression of the marker genes.

    "abstract": "Bacteria can utilize alternative {sigma} factors to regulate sets of genes in response to changes in the environment. The largest and most diverse group of alternative {sigma} factors are the Extracytoplasmic Function (ECF) {sigma} factors. {sigma}P is an ECF {sigma} factor found in Bacillus anthracis, B. cereus, and B. thuringiensis. Previous work showed {sigma}P is induced by ampicillin, a {beta}-lactam antibiotic, and required for resistance to ampicillin. However, it was not known how activation of {sigma}P is controlled or what other antibiotics may activate {sigma}P. Here we report that activation of {sigma}P is specific to a subset of {beta}-lactams and {sigma}P is required for resistance to these {beta}-lactams. We demonstrate that activation of {sigma}P is controlled by the proteolytic destruction of the anti-{sigma} factor, RsiP, and that degradation of RsiP requires multiple proteases. Upon exposure to {beta}-lactams, the extracellular domain of RsiP is cleaved by an unknown protease, which we predict cleaves at site-1. Following cleavage by the unknown protease, the N-terminus of RsiP is further degraded by the site-2 intramembrane protease, RasP. Our data indicate that RasP cleavage of RsiP is not the rate-limiting step in {sigma}P activation. This proteolytic cascade leads to activation of {sigma}P which induces resistance to {beta}-lactams likely via increased expression of {beta}-lactamases.\\n\\nImportanceThe discovery of antibiotics to treat bacterial infections has had a dramatic and positive impact on human health. However, shortly after the introduction of a new antibiotic bacteria often develop resistance. The bacterial cell envelope is essential for cell viability and is the target of many of the most commonly used antibiotics including {beta}-lactam antibiotics. Resistance to {beta}-lactams is often dependent upon {beta}-lactamases. In B. cereus, B. thuringiensis and some B. anthracis strains the expression of some {beta}-lactamases is inducible. This inducible {beta}-lactamase expression is controlled by activation of an alternative {sigma} factor called {sigma}P. Here we show that {beta}-lactam antibiotics induce {sigma}P activation by degradation of the anti-{sigma} factor RsiP.",

Although the Stop/No-go P300 (an enhanced frontocentral positivity in the event-related potential (ERP) peaking around 300 ms after a Stop/No-go stimulus, compared to Go trials) has been implicated as a measure of inhibitory-control, it is unclear how the range of motor outputs relates to the P300. We examined the nature of this association in two experiments using an Anticipatory Timing and a Go/No-go Task. Force, response onset time, and the P300 were measured.\\n\\nIn both experiments, our results showed that trial-by-trial P300 amplitude on Failed Inhibitions were continuously related to Force, where higher response forces (reflecting a greater degree of error) were associated with smaller P300 amplitudes. Compared to Successful Inhibitions, P300 amplitude was reduced and ERP onset latencies were delayed on Failed Inhibitions. Although the binary categorisation of inhibition-success (Successful vs. Failed) accounted for more variance in the data compared to force, it misses a reliable linear relationship that can be captured by continuous measures of motor output. Overall, the results provide strong evidence that the engagement of inhibitory-control varies on a continuum from trial-to-trial and that this engagement is reflected by the P300. We present an activation-to-threshold model of inhibitory-control to explain our results, which offers a new conceptual framework for describing the implementation of inhibitory-control in highly prepared motor responses. Our results also highlight the importance of studying the spectrum of motor outputs and the need for future models of inhibitory-control to account for motor output.",

Post-translational modifications of histones contribute to transcriptional regulation. Lysine demethylase 7A (Kdm7a) demethylates lysine 9 di-methylation of histone H3 (H3K9me2) and participates in the transcriptional activation of developmental genes. However, the role of Kdm7a during mouse embryonic development remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that Kdm7a-/- mouse exhibits an anterior homeotic transformation of the axial skeleton, including an increased number of presacral elements. Importantly, posterior Hox genes (caudally from Hox9) are specifically downregulated in the Kdm7a-/- embryo, which correlates with increased levels of H3K9me2. These observations suggest that Kdm7a controls the transcription of posterior Hox genes, likely via its demethylating activity, and thereby regulating the murine anterior-posterior development. Such epigenetic regulatory mechanisms may be harnessed for the proper control of coordinate body patterning in vertebrates.",

    "abstract": "Genome regulation depends on carefully programmed protein-DNA interactions that maintain or alter gene expression states, often by influencing chromatin organization. Most studies of these interactions to date have relied on bulk methods, which in many systems cannot capture the dynamic single-cell nature of these interactions as they modulate cell states. One method allowing for sensitive single-cell mapping of protein-DNA interactions is DNA adenine methyltransferase identification (DamID), which records a proteins DNA-binding history by methylating adenine bases in its vicinity, then selectively amplifies and sequences these methylated regions. These interaction sites can also be visualized using fluorescent proteins that bind to methyladenines. Here we combine these imaging and sequencing technologies in an integrated microfluidic platform (DamID) that enables single-cell isolation, imaging, and sorting, followed by DamID. We apply this system to generate paired single-cell imaging and sequencing data from a human cell line, in which we map and validate interactions between DNA and nuclear lamina proteins, providing a measure of 3D chromatin organization and broad gene regulation patterns. DamID provides the unique ability to compare paired imaging and sequencing data for each cell and between cells, enabling the joint analysis of the nuclear localization, sequence identity, and variability of protein-DNA interactions.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant activation of the Wnt signalling pathway is required for tumour initiation and survival in the majority of colorectal cancers. The development of inhibitors of Wnt signalling has been the focus of multiple drug discovery programs targeting colorectal cancer and other malignancies associated with aberrant pathway activation. However, progression of new clinical entities targeting the Wnt pathway has been slow. One challenge lies with the limited predictive power of 2D cancer cell lines because they fail to fully recapitulate intratumoural phenotypic heterogeneity. In particular, the relationship between 2D cancer cell biology and cancer stem cell function is poorly understood. By contrast, 3D tumour organoids provide a platform in which complex cell-cell interactions can be studied. However, complex 3D models provide a challenging platform for the quantitative analysis of drug responses of therapies that have differential effects on tumour cell subpopulations. Here, we generated tumour organoids from colorectal cancer patients and tested their responses to inhibitors of Tankyrase (TNKSi) which are known to modulate Wnt signalling. Using compounds with 3 orders of magnitude difference in cellular mechanistic potency together with image-based assays, we demonstrate that morphometric analyses can capture subtle alterations in organoid responses to Wnt inhibitors that are consistent with activity against a cancer stem cell subpopulation. Overall our study highlights the value of phenotypic readouts as a quantitative method to asses drug-induced effects in a relevant preclinical model.",

    "abstract": "Multilocus genomic datasets can be used to infer a rich set of information about the evolutionary history of a lineage, including gene trees, species trees, and phylogenetic networks. However, user-friendly tools to run such integrated analyses are lacking, and workflows often require tedious reformatting and handling time to shepherd data through a series of individual programs. Here, we present a tool written in Python--TREEasy--that performs automated sequence alignment (with MAFFT), gene tree inference (with IQ-Tree), species inference from concatenated data (with IQ-Tree), species tree inference from gene trees (with ASTRAL, MP-EST, and STELLS2), and phylogenetic network inference (with SNaQ and PhyloNet). The tool only requires FASTA files and nine parameters as inputs. The Tool can be run as command line or through a Graphical User Interface (GUI). As examples, we reproduced a recent analysis of staghorn coral evolution, and performed a new analysis on the evolution of the WGD clade of yeast. The latter revealed novel inferences that were not identified by previous analyses. TREEasy represents a reliable and simple tool to accelerate research in systematic biology (https://github.com/MaoYafei/TREEasy).",

    "abstract": "Ovarian hormones influence the outcomes of stress exposure and are implicated in stress-related disorders including depression, yet their roles are often complex and seemingly contradictory. Importantly, depression and stress exposure are associated with immune dysregulation, and ovarian hormones have immunomodulatory properties. However, how ovarian hormones can influence the inflammatory outcomes of stress exposure is poorly understood. Here, we examined the effects of long-term ovariectomy on the behavioral and neuroinflammatory outcomes of sub-chronic stress exposure in middle-aged mice. Briefly, sham-operated and ovariectomized mice were assigned to non-stress groups or exposed to 6 days of variable stress. Mice were assessed on a battery of behavioral tests, and cytokine concentrations were quantified in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. In the frontal cortex, postsynaptic density protein-95 expression was examined as an index of excitatory synapse number and/or stability, and phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) were measured to explore potential cell signaling pathways elicited by stress exposure and/or ovarian hormones. Long-term ovariectomy modified the central cytokine profile by robustly reducing cytokine concentrations in the frontal cortex and modestly increasing concentrations in the hippocampus. Under non-stress conditions, long-term ovariectomy also reduced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphoprotein expression in the frontal cortex and increased some measures of depressive-like behavior. The effects of sub-chronic stress exposure were however more pronounced in sham-operated mice. Notably, in sham-operated mice only, sub-chronic stress exposure increased IL-1{beta} and IL-6:IL-10 ratio in the frontal cortex and hippocampus and reduced pERK1/2 expression in the frontal cortex. Further, although sub-chronic stress exposure increased anhedonia-like behavior regardless of ovarian status, it increased passive-coping behavior in sham-operated mice only. These data indicate that long-term ovariectomy has potent effects on the central cytokine milieu and dictates the neuroinflammatory and behavioral effects of sub-chronic stress exposure in middle-aged mice. These findings therefore suggest that the immunomodulatory properties of ovarian hormones are of relevance in the context of stress and possibly depression.",

    "abstract": "Hybridization has frequently been observed between wild and domestic species and can substantially impact genetic diversity of both counterparts. Geese show some of the highest levels of interspecific hybridization across all bird orders, and two of the goose species in genus Anser have been domesticated providing excellent opportunity for joint study of domestication and hybridization. Until now, knowledge on the details of the goose domestication process has come from archaeological findings and historical writings supplemented with few studies based on mitochondrial DNA. Here, we used genome-wide markers to make the first genome-based inference of the timing of European goose domestication. We also analyzed the impact of hybridization on the genome-wide genetic variation in current populations of the European domestic goose and its wild progenitor: the greylag goose (Anser anser). Our dataset consisted of 58 wild greylags sampled around Eurasia and 75 domestic geese representing 14 breeds genotyped for 33,527 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Demographic reconstruction and clustering analysis suggested that divergence between wild and domestic geese around 5,300 generations ago was followed by long-term genetic exchange, and that greylag populations have 3.2-58.0% admixture proportions with domestic geese, with distinct geographic patterns. Surprisingly, many modern European breeds share considerable (> 10%) ancestry with Chinese domestic geese that is derived from the swan goose Anser cygnoid. We show that domestication process can progress despite continued and pervasive gene flow from the wild form.\\n\\nSignificance StatementReproductive isolation between conspecific wild and domestic populations is a cornerstone of the domestication process, yet gene flow between such wild and domestic populations has been frequently documented. European domestic geese and their wild progenitor (greylags) co-occur and can hybridize and we show that they represent a particularly persuasive case where wild and domestic populations are not isolated gene pools. Our study makes a first genome-based estimate of goose domestication, which up to now has mostly relied on archaeological findings and historical writings. We show ongoing gene flow between greylags and European domestic geese following domestication, but we also observe a surprisingly large contribution of Chinese domestic geese (a separate species) to the genetic make-up of European domestic geese.",

Most of the research is performed on laboratory strains, one of which has been fully sequenced in order to derive a reference genome. It is known that the laboratory strains differ genetically from each other, but so far no genome-scale survey of variation between the laboratory and wild zebrafish populations exists.\\n\\nHere we use Restriction-Associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) to characterize three different wild zebrafish lineages from a population genetic viewpoint, and to compare them to four common laboratory strains. For this purpose we combine new genome-wide sequence data obtained from natural samples in India, Nepal and Bangladesh with a previously published dataset. We measured nucleotide diversity, heterozygosity, allele frequency spectra and patterns of gene conversion, and find that wild fish are much more diverse than laboratory strains. Further, in wild zebrafish there is a clear signal of GC-biased gene conversion that is missing in laboratory strains. We also find that zebrafish populations in Nepal and Bangladesh are distinct from all the other strains studied, making them an attractive subject for future studies of zebrafish population genetics and molecular ecology. Finally, isolates of the same strains kept in different laboratories show a clear pattern of ongoing differentiation into genetically distinct substrains. Together, our findings broaden the basis for future genetic and evolutionary studies in Danio rerio.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we model cultural knowledge as a capital in which individuals invest at a cost. To this end, following other models of cultural evolution, we explicitly consider the investments made by individuals in culture as life history decisions. Our aim is to understand what then determines the dynamics of cultural accumulation. We show that culture can accumulate provided it improves the efficiency of peoples lives in such a way as to increase their productivity or, said differently, provided the knowledge created by previous generations improves the ability of subsequent generations to invest in new knowledge. Our central message is that this positive feedback allowing cultural accumulation can occur for many different reasons. It can occur if cultural knowledge increases peoples productivity, including in domains that have no connection with knowledge, because it frees up time that people can then spend learning and/or innovating. We also show that it can occur if cultural knowledge, and thus the higher level of resources that results from increased productivity, leads individuals to modify their life history decisions through phenotypic plasticity. Finally, we show that it can occur if technical knowledge reduces the effective cost of its own acquisition via division of labour. These results suggest that culture should not be defined only as a set of knowledge and skills but, more generally, as all the capital that has been produced by previous generations and that continues to affect current generations.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe circadian clock is a biological timing system that improves the ability of organisms to deal with environmental fluctuations. At the molecular level it consists of a network of transcription-translation feedback loops, involving genes that activate (bmal and clock - positive loop) and repress expression (cryptochrome (cry) and period (per) - negative loop). This is regulated by daily alternations of light but can also be affected by temperature. Fish, as ectothermic, depend on the environmental temperature and thus are good models to study its integration within the circadian system. Here, we studied the molecular evolution of circadian genes in four Squalius freshwater fish species, distributed across Western Iberian rivers affected by two climatic types with different environmental conditions (e.g. light and temperature). S. carolitertii and S. pyrenaicus inhabit the colder northern region under Atlantic climate type, while S. torgalensis, S. aradensis and some populations of S. pyrenaicus inhabit the warmer southern region affected by summer droughts, under Mediterranean climate type.\n\nResultsWe identified 16 circadian-core genes in the Squalius species using a comparative transcriptomics approach. We detected evidence of positive selection in nine of these genes using methods based on dN/dS. Positive selection was mainly found in cry and per genes of the negative loop of the cycle, with 11 putatively adaptive substitutions mostly located on protein domains. Evidence for positive selection is predominant in southern populations affected by the Mediterranean climate type. By predicting protein features we found that changes at sites under positive selection can impact protein thermostability by changing their aliphatic index and isoelectric point. Additionally, in nine genes, the phylogenetic clustering of species that belong to different clades but inhabit southern basins with similar environmental conditions indicated evolutionary convergence.\n\nConclusionsOur results support that temperature may be a strong selective pressure driving the evolution of genes involved in the circadian system. By integrating sequence-based functional protein prediction with dN/dS-based methods to detect selection we also uncovered adaptive convergence in the southern populations, probably related to their similar thermal conditions.",

    "abstract": "Precise identification of causative variants from whole-genome sequencing data, including both coding and non-coding variants, is challenging. The CAGI5 SickKids clinical genome challenge provided an opportunity to assess our ability to extract such information. Participants in the challenge were required to match each of 24 whole-genome sequences to the correct phenotypic profile and to identify the disease class of each genome. These are all rare disease cases that have resisted genetic diagnosis in a state-of-the-art pipeline. The patients have a range of eye, neurological, and connective-tissue disorders. We used a gene-centric approach to address this problem, assigning each gene a multi-phenotype-matching score. Mutations in the top scoring genes for each phenotype profile were ranked on a six-point scale of pathogenicity probability, resulting in an approximately equal number of top ranked coding and non-coding candidate variants overall. We were able to assign the correct disease class for 12 cases and the correct genome to a clinical profile for five cases. The challenge assessor found genes in three of these five cases as likely appropriate. In the post-submission phase, after careful screening of the genes in the correct genome we identified additional potential diagnostic variants, a high proportion of which are non-coding.",

The model is capable of odor identification from a small number of observations, while reproducing cellular plasticity commonly observed during development. We extend the framework to reward-based learning, and show that the circuit is able to rapidly learn odor-reward association with a plausible neural architecture.

    "abstract": "Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are voltage-independent cation channels that detect decreases in extracellular pH. Dysregulation of ASICs underpins a number of pathologies. Of particular interest is ASIC3, which is recognised as a key sensor of acid-induced pain and is instrumental in the establishment of pain arising from inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, the identification of new ASIC3 modulators and the mechanistic understanding of how these compounds modulate ASIC3 could be important for the development of new strategies to counteract the detrimental effects of dysregulated ASIC3 activity in inflammation. Here, we report the identification of novel ASIC3 modulators based on the ASIC3 agonist, 2-guanidine-4-methylquinazoline (GMQ). Through a GMQ-guided in silico screening of Food and Drug administration (FDA)-approved drugs, 5 compounds were selected and tested for their modulation of rat ASIC3 (rASIC3) using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology. Of the chosen drugs, guanabenz (GBZ), an 2-adrenoceptor agonist, produced similar effects to GMQ on rASIC3, activating the channel at physiological pH (pH 7.4) and potentiating its response to mild acidic (pH 7) stimuli. Sephin1, a GBZ derivative that lacks 2-adrenoceptor activity, has been proposed to act as a selective inhibitor of a regulatory subunit of the stress-induced protein phosphatase 1 (PPP1R15A) with promising therapeutic potential for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. However, we found that like GBZ, sephin1 activates rASIC3 at pH 7.4 and potentiates its response to acidic stimulation (pH 7), i.e. sephin1 is a novel modulator of rASIC3. Furthermore, docking experiments showed that, like GMQ, GBZ and sephin1 likely interact with the nonproton ligand sensor domain of rASIC3. Overall, these data demonstrate the utility of computational analysis for identifying novel ASIC3 modulators, which can be validated with electrophysiological analysis and may lead to the development of better compounds for targeting ASIC3 in the treatment of inflammatory conditions.",

Top performing programs for each metric are identified by assigning a rank based on statistical multiple comparisons of accuracy and precision, modeled as matches in a round-robin style tournament. This comparison method yields a clearly defined and consistent standard for characterizing program performance, avoiding the use of non-standard ad hoc interpretations of multiple comparisons between programs. Using this comparison method and a dataset of manually analyzed images as a ground-truth, we show that REAVER was the top ranked program for both accuracy and precision for all metrics quantified, including vessel length density, vessel area fraction, mean vessel diameter, and branchpoint count. REAVER can be used to quantify differences in blood vessel architectures between study groups, which makes it particularly useful in experiments designed to evaluate the effects of different external perturbations (e.g. drugs or disease states).",

NANOG and GATA6 are key regulators of this binary differentiation event, which is further modulated by heterogeneous FGF signalling. When and how Epi and PrE lineage specification is initiated within the developing embryo is still unclear. Here we generated NANOG and GATA6 double KO (DKO) mouse embryos and performed single-cell expression analyses. We found that the ICM was unable to differentiate in the DKO mice, allowing us to characterize the ICM precursor state. The normally heterogeneous expression of Fgf4 between cells was significantly reduced in DKO ICMs, impairing FGF signalling. In contrast, several pluripotency markers did still display cell-to-cell expression variability in DKO ICMs. This revealed a primary heterogeneity independent of NANOG, GATA6 and FGF signalling that may also be conserved in humans. We found that NANOG is key in the initiation of epiblast specification already between the 16- and 32-cell stages, enabling the cell-clustered expression of many pluripotency genes. Our data uncover previously unknown biology in the early mouse embryo with potential implications for the field of pluripotent stem cells in human and other mammals.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic rate is considered to determine the energetic investment placed into life-history traits, regulating the speed of an organisms life-cycle and forming the so called \\\"pace-of-life\\\". However, how metabolic rate and life-history traits co-evolve remains unclear. For instance, the energetic demands of life-history traits, including the number of energy allocation trade-offs, is unlikely to remain constant over ontogeny. Therefore, the predicted coevolution between metabolic rate and life-history could be specific to particular ontogenetic stages, rather than a stable property of an organism. Here, we test the ontogenetic dependency of the coevolution between metabolic rate and the pace of life-history, under strictly standardized conditions using 30 species of killifish, which are either annual species adapted to ephemeral pools or non-annual species inhabiting more permanent waterbodies. Standard metabolic rates were estimated at three ontogenetic stages, together with relevant life-history traits, i.e. growth (juveniles), maturity (young adults), and reproductive rate (reproductive adults). Life-history traits largely followed predicted pace-of-life patterns, with overall faster/higher rates in annual species. The divergences in life-history traits across species tended to increase over ontogeny, being smallest during juvenile growth and largest in reproductive adults. However, associations between life-history strategy and metabolic rate followed a reversed pattern, being strongest in juveniles, but lowest in reproductive adults. Our results are concordant with the number of energetic trade-offs increasing over ontogeny, which results in a stronger covariation between physiology and life-history traits earlier in ontogeny.",

    "abstract": "Germ granules are biomolecular condensates that promote germ cell totipotency in most, if not all, animals. In C. elegans, MEG-3 and MEG-4 are two intrinsically disordered proteins that are redundantly required for the phase separations that drive germ granule assembly in germline blastomeres. Here, we show that animals lacking MEG-3/4 exhibit defects in dsRNA-mediated gene silencing (RNAi) that are due, at least in part, to defects in systemic RNAi. Interestingly, these RNAi defects are transgenerationally disconnected from meg-3/4 genotype: RNAi defects do not arise until 5-9 generations after animals become mutant for meg-3/4, and RNAi defects persist for 9-11 generations after meg-3/4 genotype is restored to wild type. Similar non-Mendelian patterns of inheritance are associated with other mutations that disrupt germ granule formation, indicating that germ granule disruption is the likely cause of genotype/phenotype disconnects. Loss of germ granules is associated with the production of aberrant populations of endogenous siRNAs, which, remarkably, are propagated for {cong}10 generations in wild-type descendants of animals that lacked germ granules. sid-1, which encodes a factor required for systemic RNAi in C. elegans, is inappropriately and heritably silenced by aberrantly expressed sid-1 endogenous siRNAs, suggesting that transgenerational silencing of sid-1 likely underlies the heritable defect in RNAi. We conclude that one function of germ granules is to organize RNA-based epigenetic inheritance pathways and that failure to assemble germ granules has consequences that persist across many generations.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the evolutionary diversification and morphological evolution of grass supertribe Poodae (subfam. Pooideae, Poaceae) we conducted a comprehensive molecular phylogenetic analysis including representatives from most of their accepted genera. We focused on generating a DNA sequence dataset of plastid matK gene-3trnK exon and trnL- trnF regions and nuclear ribosomal ITS1-5.8S gene-ITS2 and ETS that was taxonomically overlapping as completely as possible (altogether 257 species). The idea was to infer whether phylogenetic trees or certain clades based on plastid and nuclear DNA data correspond with each other or discord, revealing signatures of past hybridization. The datasets were analysed using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches. Instances of severe conflicts between the phylogenetic trees derived from both datasets, some of which have been noted earlier, unambiguously point to hybrid origin of several lineages (subtribes, groups of genera, sometimes genera) such as Phalaridinae, Scolochloinae, Sesleriinae, Torreyochloinae; Arctopoa, Castellia, Graphephorum, Hyalopodium, Lagurus, Macrobriza, Puccinellia plus Sclerochloa, Sesleria, Tricholemma, American Trisetum, etc. and presumably Airinae, Holcinae and Phleinae.  Calamagrostis flavens appears to be an intergeneric hybrid between Agrostis and Calamagrostis. Most frequently there is good agreement of other regions of the trees, apart from intrinsic different phylogenetic resolution of the respective DNA markers. To explore the to date rather unclear morphological evolution of our study group a data matrix encompassing finally 188 characters was analysed for ancestral state reconstructions (ASR) using the tree from the combined molecular dataset as presumably best approximation to the species phylogeny. For 74 characters ASRs were feasible and yielded partly surprising results for the study group as a whole but also for some of their subdivisions. Considering taxonomy and classification it became evident, that many morphological characters show a very high degree of homoplasy and are seemingly able to change within comparatively short timespans in the evolution of our grasses. Most of the taxonomic units distinguished within our study group, e.g. as subtribes, are defined less by consistent morphological characters or character combinations and should be rather understood as clades revealed by molecular phylogenetic analysis. One reason for this extreme homoplasy concerning traditionally highly rated characters of inflorescences or spikelets and their components might be that they have little to do with pollination (always wind) or adaptation to pollinators as in other angiosperms but rather with dispersal and diaspores. Easily changing structure of spikelet disarticulation, of glume, lemma or awn characters might be advantageous in the rapid adaptation to different habitats and micro-habitats, which was evidently most successfully accomplished by these grasses. A partly revised classification of Poodae is presented, including a re-instatement of tribes Aveneae and Poeae s.str. Following a comparatively narrow delineation of preferably monophyletic subtribes, Antinoriinae, Avenulinae, Brizochloinae, Helictochloinae, Hypseochloinae are described as new. New genera are Arctohyalopoa and Hyalopodium. New combinations are Arctohyalopoa lanatiflora, A. lanatiflora subsp. ivanoviae, A. lanatiflora subsp. momica, Colpodium biebersteinianum, C. kochii, C. trichopodum, C. verticillatum, Deschampsia micrathera, Dupontia fulva, Festuca masafuerana, Hyalopodium araraticum, Paracolpodium baltistanicum, Parapholis cylindrica, P. xpauneroi. Festuca masatierrae is a new name.\\n\\nSupporting Information may be found online in the Supporting Information section at the end of the article.",

    "abstract": "Phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate (PI5P) is a low abundance lipid proposed to have functions in cell migration, DNA damage responses, receptor trafficking and insulin signalling in metazoans. However, studies of PI5P function are limited by the lack of scalable techniques to quantify its level from cells and tissues in multicellular organisms. Currently, PI5P measurement requires the use of radionuclide labelling approaches that are not easily applicable in tissues or in vivo samples. In this study, we describe a simple and reliable, non-radioactive mass assay to measure total PI5P levels from cells and tissues of Drosophila, a genetically tractable multicellular model. We use 18O-ATP to label PI5P from tissue extracts while converting it into PI(4,5)P2 using an in vitro kinase reaction. The product of this reaction can be selectively detected and quantified with high sensitivity using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry platform. Further, using this method, we capture and quantify the unique acyl chain composition of PI5P from Drosophila cells and tissues. Finally, we demonstrate the use of this technique to quantify elevations in PI5P levels, from both Drosophila larval tissues and cultured cells depleted of phosphatidylinositol 5 phosphate 4-kinase (PIP4K), that metabolizes PI5P into PI(4,5)P2 thus regulating its levels. Thus, we demonstrate the potential of our method to quantify PI5P levels with high sensitivity levels from cells and tissues of multicellular organisms thus accelerating understanding of PI5P functions in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Individual-level polygenic scores can now explain [~]10% of the variation in number of years of completed education. However, associations between polygenic scores and education capture not only genetic propensity but information about the environment that individuals are exposed to. This is because individuals passively inherit effects of parental genotypes, since their parents typically also provide the rearing environment. In other words, the strong correlation between offspring and parent genotypes results in an association between the offspring genotypes and the rearing environment. This is termed passive gene-environment correlation. We present an approach to test for the extent of passive gene-environment correlation for education without requiring intergenerational data. Specifically, we use information from 6311 individuals in the UK Biobank who were adopted in childhood to compare genetic influence on education between adoptees and non-adopted individuals. Adoptees rearing environments are less correlated with their genotypes, because they do not share genes with their adoptive parents. We find that polygenic scores are twice as predictive of years of education in non-adopted individuals compared to adoptees (R2= 0.074 vs 0.037, difference test p= 8.23 x 10-24). We provide another kind of evidence for the influence of parental behaviour on offspring education: individuals in the lowest decile of education polygenic score attain significantly more education if they are adopted, possibly due to educationally supportive adoptive environments. Overall, these results suggest that genetic influences on education are mediated via the home environment. As such, polygenic prediction of educational attainment represents gene-environment correlations just as much as it represents direct genetic effects.",

    "abstract": "Two simplifying hypotheses have been proposed for whole-plant respiration. One links respiration to photosynthesis; the other to biomass. Using a first-principles carbon balance model with a prescribed live woody biomass turnover, applied at a forest research site where multidecadal measurements are available for comparison, we show that if turnover is fast the accumulation of respiring biomass is low and respiration depends primarily on photosynthesis; while if turnover is slow the accumulation of respiring biomass is high and respiration depends primarily on biomass. But the first scenario is inconsistent with evidence for substantial carryover of fixed carbon between years, while the second implies far too great an increase in respiration during stand development - leading to depleted carbohydrate reserves and an unrealistically high mortality risk. These two mutually incompatible hypotheses are thus both incorrect. Respiration is not linearly related either to photosynthesis or to biomass, but it is more strongly controlled by recent photosynthates (and reserve availability) than by total biomass.",
