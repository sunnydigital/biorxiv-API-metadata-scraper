    "abstract": "Genome evolution in bacterial endosymbionts is notoriously extreme: the combined effects of strong genetic drift and unique selective pressures result in highly reduced genomes with distinctive adaptations to hosts [1-4]. These processes are mostly known from animal endosymbionts, where nutritional endosymbioses represent the best-studied systems. However, eukaryotic microbes, or protists, also harbor diverse bacterial endosymbionts, but their genome reduction and functional relationships with their more diverse hosts are largely unexplored [5-7]. We sequenced the genomes of four bacterial endosymbionts from three species of diplonemids, poorly-studied but abundant and diverse heterotrophic protists [8-10]. The endosymbionts come from two intracellular families from different orders, Rickettsiaceae and Holosporaceae, that have invaded diplonemids multiple times, and their genomes have converged on an extremely small size (605-632 kbp), similar gene content (e.g., metabolite transporters and secretion systems), and reduced metabolic potential (e.g., loss of energy metabolism). These characteristics are generally found in both families, but the diplonemid endosymbionts have evolved greater extremes in parallel. Their modified type VI secretion systems are likely involved in the manipulation of host metabolism (e.g., interactions with host mitochondria) or defense against bacterial infections, although their similar effector/immunity proteins may also allow for co-occurring Holosporaceae species in one diplonemid host. Finally, modified cellular machinery like ATP synthase without oxidative phosphorylation and reduced flagella present in both diplonemid endosymbionts and nutritional animal endosymbionts indicates that intracellular mechanisms have converged in bacterial endosymbionts with various functions and from different eukaryotic hosts across the tree of life.",

    "abstract": "Genetic and environmental factors play a major role in metabolic health. However, they do not act in isolation, as a change in an environmental factor such as diet may exert different effects based on an individuals genotype. Here, we sought to understand how such gene-diet interactions influenced nutrient storage and utilisation, a major determinant of metabolic disease. We subjected the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), comprising 200 genetically divergent inbred fly strains, to diets varying in sugar, fat and protein. We assessed starvation resistance, a holistic phenotype of nutrient storage and utilisation that can be robustly measured. Diet influenced the starvation resistance of each strain, but this effect varied markedly between strains. This demonstrates that genetics plays a major role in the response to diet. Furthermore, heritability analysis revealed that the greatest variability arose from diets either high in sugar or high in protein. To uncover the genetic underpinnings of this variation, we mapped 1,239 diet-responsive SNPs in 534 genes, 325 of which have human orthologues. Using whole-body knockdown, we confirmed that 30 candidate genes were required for glucose tolerance, storage and utilization. In particular, we characterised CG4607, a GLUT6/GLUT8 homolog, as a key protein involved in sugar tolerance. Overall, this provides strong evidence that genetics is a major contributor to how individuals respond to diets of varying nutrient composition. It is likely that a similar principle may be applied to metabolic disease in higher organisms thus supporting the case for nutrigenomics as an important health strategy.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSeveral observational studies suggest that variations in thyroid function, even within the normal range, are a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, but it remains to be determined if these associations are causal or not. This study investigates whether the relationship between variation in normal range thyroid function, as well as hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, and the risk of stroke and Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) are causal and via which pathways these relations are mediated.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsWe performed Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses for stroke and CAD using genetic instruments associated with TSH and FT4 levels respectively within either the normal range, hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. In detected associations, the potential mediatory role of known stroke and CAD risk factors was also examined. A one standard deviation increase in TSH was associated with a 5% decrease in the risk of stroke (OR=0.95, 95% CI= 0.91 to 0.99). Multivariable MR analyses indicated that this effect is mediated through atrial fibrillation (AF). Hashimotos Disease (HD) was associated with a 7% increased risk of CAD (OR=1.07, 95% CI= 1.01 to 1.13). The effect of Hashimotos Disease (HD) on CAD risk appears to be mediated via body mass index (BMI).\\n\\nConclusionsThese results provide important new insights into the causal relationships and mediating pathways between thyroid function, stroke and CAD. Specifically, we identify normal range TSH levels and HD as potential modifiable risk factors for stroke and CAD, respectively.",

In India, PCOS affects the life of up to 19.4 million women of age 14-25 years. Gut microbiome composition might contribute to PCOS susceptibility. We profiled the microbiome in DNA isolated from faecal samples by 16S rRNA sequencing in 19/20 women with/without PCOS from Kashmir, India. We assigned genera to sequenced species with an average 121k reads depth and included bacteria detected in at least 1/3 of the subjects or with average relative abundance [&ge;]0.1%. We compared the relative abundances of 40/58 operational taxonomic units in family/genus level between cases and controls, and in relation to 33 hormonal and metabolic factors, by multivariate analyses adjusted for confounders, and corrected for multiple testing. Seven genera were significantly enriched in PCOS cases: Sarcina, Alkalibacterium and Megasphaera, and previously reported for PCOS Bifidobacterium, Collinsella, Paraprevotella and Lactobacillus. We identified significantly increased relative abundance of Bifidobacteriaceae (median 6.07% vs. 2.77%) and Aerococcaceae (0.03% vs. 0.004%), whereas we detected lower relative abundance Peptococcaceae (0.16% vs. 0.25%) in PCOS cases. For the first time, we identified a significant direct association between butyrate producing Eubacterium and follicle-stimulating hormone levels. We observed increased relative abundance of Collinsella and Paraprevotella with higher fasting blood glucose levels, and Paraprevotella and Alkalibacterium with larger hip and waist circumference, and weight. We show a relationship between gut microbiome composition and PCOS linking it to specific reproductive health metabolic and hormonal predictors in Indian women.",

    "abstract": "Malaria infection starts with the injection of motile Plasmodium sporozoites into the hosts skin during a mosquito bite. Previous studies using the rodent malaria model indicate that the dermal inoculation site may be where sporozoites are most vulnerable to antibodies, yet, functional in vivo assays with human malaria parasites are lacking. Here, we present the first characterization of P. falciparum sporozoites in the skin, comparing their motility to two rodent malaria species and investigating whether the environment of its natural host influences P. falciparum sporozoite motility using a human skin xenograft model. The combined data suggest that in contrast to the liver and blood stages, the skin is not a species-specific barrier for Plasmodium. We observe that P. falciparum sporozoites inoculated into mouse skin move with similar speed, displacement and duration, and enter blood vessels in similar numbers as the rodent parasites. Thus, interventions targeting P. falciparum sporozoite migration can be tested in the murine dermis. Importantly, to streamline quantification of sporozoite motility, we developed a toolbox allowing for automated detection and tracking of sporozoites in intravital microscopy videos. This establishes a platform to test vaccine candidates, immunization protocols, monoclonal antibodies and drug candidates for their impact on human malaria sporozoites in vivo. Screening of intervention strategies for in vivo efficacy against Pf sporozoites using this new platform will have the potential to validate targets prior to expensive clinical trials.",

Functionally the myristate often primes for subsequent palmitoylation and stable membrane attachment, however, growing evidence also suggests additional regulatory roles for myristoylation on proteins. Here we describe the first global chemoproteomic screening of protein myristoylation in Toxoplasma gondii. Through quantitative mass spectrometry coupled with validated chemoproteomic tools, we identify 65 myristoylated proteins. We report functionally important myristoylation on the key signalling protein CDPK1 and, surprisingly, myristoylation of the microneme protein 7 (MIC7), a predicted type-I-transmembrane protein. We demonstrate that myristoylation of MIC7 is not important for the trafficking to micronemes, but appears to play a role in host cell invasion. This dataset represents a large fraction of the parasites myristoylated proteome and a prerequisite to investigate this modification in Toxoplasma.",

IPNV isolates have been phylogenetically classified into eight genogroups, of which two are present in Chile, genogroups 1 and 5. Here we compare the mortality rate caused by isolates from both genogroups in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) fry to determine if there is an association between host susceptibility and phylogenetic characterization of IPNV. Fish were challenged by immersion with one of four isolates (two of each genogroup) and mortality curves were assessed after 30 days. Viral load was measured in all mortalities and in live fish sampled at 1, 7 and 20 days post-infection. Although mortality was low throughout the challenge, differences were found between fish infected with different isolates. Both isolates from genogroup 1, caused greater cumulative mortalities than either of the isolates from Genogroup 5. When combined, the overall mortality rate of fish challenged with genogroup 1 isolates was significantly higher than those infected with genogroup 5. However, viral load was lower on trout infected with genogroup 1 isolates. These results suggest that rainbow trout are more susceptible to IPNV isolates from genogroup 1 than genogroup 5.",

    "abstract": "Glaucoma is an age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Chronic ocular hypertension, an important risk factor for glaucoma, leads to RGC axonal injury at the optic nerve head. This insult triggers molecularly distinct cascades governing RGC somal apoptosis and axonal degeneration. The molecular mechanisms activated by ocular hypertensive insult that drive both RGC somal apoptosis and axonal degeneration are incompletely understood. The cellular response to endoplasmic reticulum stress and induction of pro-apoptotic DNA damage inducible transcript 3 (DDIT3, also known as CHOP) has been implicated as a driver of neurodegeneration in many disease models, including glaucoma. RGCs express DDIT3 upon glaucoma-relevant insults, and importantly, DDIT3 has been shown to contribute to both RGC somal apoptosis and axonal degeneration after acute induction of ocular hypertension. However, the role of DDIT3 in RGC somal and axonal degeneration has not been critically tested in a model of age-related chronic ocular hypertension. Here, we investigated the role of DDIT3 in glaucomatous RGC death using an age-related, naturally occurring ocular hypertensive mouse model of glaucoma, DBA/2J mice (D2). To accomplish this, a null allele of Ddit3 was backcrossed onto the D2 background. Homozygous Ddit3 deletion did not alter gross retinal or optic nerve head morphology, nor did it change the ocular hypertensive profile of D2 mice. In D2 mice, Ddit3 deletion conferred mild protection to RGC somas but did not significantly prevent RGC axonal degeneration. Together, these data suggest that DDIT3 plays a minor role in perpetuating RGC somal apoptosis caused by chronic ocular hypertension-induced axonal injury, but does not significantly contribute to distal axonal degeneration.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic control of protein degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome system is thought to play a crucial role in neuronal function and synaptic plasticity. The proteasome subunit Rpt6, an AAA ATPase subunit of the 19S regulatory particle, has emerged as an important site for regulation of 26S proteasome function in neurons. Phosphorylation of Rpt6 on serine 120 (S120) can stimulate the catalytic rate of substrate degradation by the 26S proteasome and this site is targeted by the plasticity-related kinase calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), making it an attractive candidate for regulation of proteasome function in neurons. Several in vitro studies have shown that altered Rpt6 S120 phosphorylation can affect the structure and function of synapses. To evaluate the importance of Rpt6 S120 phosphorylation in vivo, we created two mouse models which feature mutations at S120 that block or mimic phosphorylation at this site. We find that peptidase and ATPase activities are upregulated in the phospho-mimetic mutant and downregulated in the phospho-dead mutant (S120 mutated to aspartic acid (S120D) or alanine (S120A), respectively). Surprisingly, these mutations had no effect on basal synaptic transmission, long-term potentiation, and dendritic spine dynamics and density in the hippocampus. Furthermore, these mutants displayed no deficits in cued and contextual fear memory. Thus, in a mouse model that blocks or mimics phosphorylation at this site, either compensatory mechanisms negate these effects, or small variations in proteasome activity are not enough to induce significant changes in synaptic structure, plasticity, or behavior.",

    "abstract": "As the number of individuals living beyond the age of 65 is rapidly increasing, so is the need to develop strategies to combat the age-related cognitive decline that may threaten independent living. Although the link between altered neuronal signaling and age-related cognitive impairments is not completely understood, it is evident that declining cognitive abilities are at least partially due to synaptic dysfunction. Aging is accompanied by well-documented changes in both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic signaling across species. Age-related synaptic alterations are not uniform across the brain, however, with different regions showing unique patterns of vulnerability in advanced age. In the hippocampus, increased activity within the CA3 subregion has been observed across species, and this can be reversed with anti-epileptic medication (Bakker et al., 2012). In contrast to CA3, the dentate gyrus shows reduced activity with age and declining metabolic activity. Ketogenic diets have been shown to decrease seizure incidence and severity in epilepsy, improve metabolic function in diabetes type II, and improve cognitive function in aged rats. This link between neuronal activity and metabolism suggests that metabolic interventions may be able to ameliorate synaptic signaling deficits accompanying advanced age. We therefore investigated the ability of a dietary regimen capable of inducing nutritional ketosis and improving cognition to alter synapse-related gene expression across the dentate gyrus, CA3 and CA1 subregions of the hippocampus. Following 12 weeks of a ketogenic or calorie-matched standard diet, RTq-PCR was used to quantify expression levels of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic signaling genes within CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus. While there were no age or diet-related changes in CA1 gene expression, expression levels were significantly altered within CA3 by age and within the dentate gyrus by diet for several genes involved in presynaptic glutamate regulation and postsynaptic excitation and plasticity. These data demonstrate subregion-specific alterations in synaptic signaling with age and the potential for a ketogenic diet to alter these processes in dissociable ways across different brain structures that are uniquely vulnerable in older animals.",

    "abstract": "Theoretical and experimental evidence suggest that the induction of oscillatory activity by an external rhythmic source on a specific brain area is maximally efficient if the input pattern matches its so-called  natural frequency, defined as the predominant neural rhythm at which the activity of this area tends to fluctuate spontaneously. Based on this principle, single pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) coupled to scalp electroencephalography (EEG) has provided evidence of frequency-specific power increases within a unique  natural frequency band, considered common to the whole lobe.\\n\\nIn an attempt to gain deeper insight into this phenomenon and set the basis for a finer-grained atlas of  natural frequencies, here we analyzed intracranial EEG (iEEG) signals modulated by single pulses of direct electrical brain stimulation in human patients implanted with depth multielectrodes. Our analyses revealed changes in local EEG activity emerging from local oscillators and contributing to a complex distribution of frequency-specific  natural rhythmic responses throughout cortical regions. Moreover, challenging the notion of  natural oscillations featuring a predominant frequency band characteristic for an entire lobe, our data support a rich diversity of spectral fingerprints (narrowband, vs. broadband or multiband) with single or multiple frequency peaks, often encompassing contiguous frequency bands, operating at a very local scale.\\n\\nOur findings contribute novel insights on which specific brain areas could be more likely to be synchronized at a given frequencies band and their preferred coupling frequencies, features that could ultimately inform on their structural and functional organization. Our results may also increase our mechanistic understanding of invasive and noninvasive brain stimulation and promote further developments of these approaches for the manipulation of brain oscillations subtending normal and impaired cognition.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) is an aggressive disease with poor prognosis, no available cure, and low survival rates. Currently, there are several classes of vasodilator drugs that are widely used as treatment strategies for PAH. These include (i) endothelin-1 receptor antagonists, (ii) phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, (iii) prostacyclin analogues, and (iv) soluble guanylate cyclase activators. Despite their clinical benefits, these therapies are hindered by their systemic side effects. This limitation could be overcome by controlled drug release, with future modifications for targeted drug delivery, using a nanomedicine approach. In the current study, we have evaluated one particular nanomedicine platform (the highly porous iron-based metal-organic framework (MOF) commonly referred to as MIL-89) as a carrier of the PAH drug sildenafil. We have previously shown that MIL-89 is relatively non-toxic in a range of human cell types and well tolerated in vivo. Here we prepared a nano-formulation of MIL-89 (nanoMIL-89) and then successfully charged it with a payload of sildenafil (sil@nanoMIL-891). sil@nanoMIL-89 was then shown to release sildenafil in a biphasic manner with an initial rapid release over 6 hours followed by a more sustained release over 72 hours. Both nanoMIL-89 and sil@nanoMIL-89 were relatively non-toxic when incubated with human endothelial cells for 24 hours. Finally, the vasodilator effect of sil@nanoMIL-89 was measured over 8 hours using isolated mouse aorta. Consistent with drug release kinetics, sil@nanoMIL-89 induced vasodilation after a lag phase of >4 hours. Thus, in sil@nanoMIL-89, we have produced a nano-formulation of sildenafil displaying delayed drug release corresponding to vasodilator activity. Further pharmacological assessment of sil@nanoMIL-89, including in PAH models, is now required and constitutes the subject of ongoing investigation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundScientific research is replete with poor accessibility to data, materials, and protocol, which limits the reproducibility of a study. Transparency with regard to materials, protocols, and raw data sets enhances reproducibility by providing the critical information necessary to verify, replicate, and resynthesize research findings. The extent to which transparency and reproducibility exist in the field of orthopaedics is unclear. In our study, we aimed to evaluate transparency and reproducibility-related characteristics of randomly sampled publications in orthopaedic journals.\\n\\nMethodsWe used the National Library of Medicine catalog to identify English language and MEDLINE-indexed orthopaedic journals. From the 74 journals meeting our inclusion criteria, we randomly sampled 300 publications using a refined PubMed search that were published between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2018. Two investigators were trained for data extraction and analysis. Both investigators were blinded and independently extracted data from the 300 studies.\\n\\nResultsOur initial search yielded 68,102 publications, from which we drew a random sample of 300 publications. Of these 300 publications, 286 were screened for empirical data and 14 were inaccessible. For analysis purposes, we excluded publications without empirical data. Of the 182 with empirical data, 13 studies (7.1%) included a data availability statement, 9 (4.9%) reported materials were available, none (0.0%) provided analysis scripts, 2 (1.1%) provided access to the protocol used, 5 (2.7%) were preregistered, and only 2 (1.1%) provided a statement about being a replicated study.\\n\\nConclusionsComponents necessary for reproducibility are lacking in orthopaedic surgery journals. The vast majority of publications did not provide data or material availability statements, protocols, or analysis scripts, and had no preregistration statements. Intervention is needed to improve reproducibility in the field of orthopaedics. The current state of reproducibility in orthopaedic surgery could be improved by combined efforts from funding agencies, authors, peer reviewers, and journals alike.\\n\\nLevel of EvidenceN/A",

CARs are comprised of activating and costimulatory intracellular signaling domains derived from endogenous T cells that initiate signaling required for T cell activation, including ERK activation through the MAPK pathway. Understanding the mechanisms by which co-stimulatory domains influence signaling can help guide the design of next-generation CARs. Therefore, we constructed an experimentally-validated computational model of anti-CD19 CARs in T cells bearing the CD3{zeta} domain alone or in combination with CD28. We used ensemble modeling to explore different mechanisms of CD28 co-stimulation on the ERK response time. Model simulations show that CD28 primarily influences ERK activation by enhancing the phosphorylation kinetics of CD3{zeta}, predictions that are validated by experimental measurements. Overall, we present a mechanistic mathematical modeling framework that can be used to gain insights into the mechanism of CAR T cell activation and produce new testable hypotheses.",

    "abstract": "The thick (myosin-containing) filaments of vertebrate skeletal muscle are arranged in a hexagonal lattice, interleaved with an array of thin (actin-containing) filaments with which they interact to produce contraction. X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy have shown that there are two types of thick filament lattice. In the simple lattice, all filaments have the same orientation about their long axis, while in the super lattice, nearest neighbors have rotations differing by 60{degrees}. Tetrapods (amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals) typically have only a super lattice, while the simple lattice is confined to fish. We have carried out X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy of the soleus (SOL) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles of the rat and found that while the EDL has a super-lattice, as expected, the SOL has a simple lattice. The EDL and SOL of the rat are unusual in being essentially pure fast and slow muscles respectively. The mixed fiber content of most tetrapod muscles and/or lattice disorder may explain why the simple lattice has not been apparent in these vertebrates before. This is supported by only weak simple lattice diffraction in the X-ray pattern of mouse SOL, which has a greater mix of fiber types than rat. We conclude that the simple lattice might be common in tetrapods. The correlation between fiber type and filament lattice arrangement suggests that the lattice arrangement may contribute to the functional properties of a muscle.\\n\\nSummaryThe three-dimensional arrangement of thick filaments in skeletal muscle is studied by X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy. A correlation is found between thick filament lattice type (simple or super lattice) and fiber type (fast/slow). This suggests that lattice organization contributes to muscle functional properties",

    "abstract": "Microbes routinely face the challenge of acquiring territory and resources on wet surfaces. Cells move in large groups inside thin, surface-bound water layers, often achieving speeds of 30 {micro}m/s within this environment, where viscous forces dominate over inertial forces (low Reynolds number). The canonical Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis is a model organism for the study of collective migration over surfaces with groups exhibiting motility on length scales three orders of magnitude larger than themselves within a few doubling times. Genetic and chemical studies clearly show that the secretion of endogenous surfactants and availability of free surface water are required for this fast group motility. Here we show that: (i) water availability is a sensitive control parameter modulating an abiotic jamming-like transition that determines whether the group remains fluidized and therefore collectively motile, (ii) groups self-organize into discrete layers as they travel, (iii) group motility does not require proliferation, rather groups are pulled from the front, and (iv) flow within expanding groups is capable of moving material from the parent colony into the expanding tip of a cellular dendrite with implications for expansion into regions of varying nutrient content. Together, these findings illuminate the physical structure of surface-motile groups and demonstrate that physical properties, like cellular packing fraction and flow, regulate motion from the scale of individual cells up to length scales of centimeters.",

    "abstract": "The presence or absence of oxygen in the environment is a strong effector of cellular metabolism and physiology. Like many eukaryotes and some bacteria, Bacillus subtilis is an obligate aerobe that primarily utilizes oxygen during respiration to generate ATP. Despite the importance of oxygen for B. subtilis survival, we know little about how oxygen is consumed during growth and how populations respond to shifts in oxygen availability. Here, we find that when oxygen was depleted from stationary phase cultures [~]90% of B. subtilis 3610 cells died and lysed due to autolysin activity; the remaining cells maintained colony-forming ability. Interestingly, the domesticated 168 strain maintained a higher optical density than 3610 during oxygen depletion due to the formation of cell-wall-less protoplasts, but the remaining, rod-shaped cells were >100-fold less viable than 3610. We discovered that the higher viability in 3610 was due to its ability to produce the antibacterial compound surfactin, as surfactin addition rescued 168 viability and also increased yield in aerobic growth. We further demonstrate that surfactin strongly depolarizes the B. subtilis membrane, and that other known membrane-potential disruptors restore viability to 168. These findings highlight the importance of surfactin for survival during oxygen-depleted conditions and demonstrate that antimicrobials normally considered harmful can instead benefit cells in stressful conditions when the terminal electron acceptor in respiration is limiting.",

For this work, unpublished material of pampatheriids (numerous osteoderms, one partial skull and a few postcranial bones) from Neogene formations of Colombia was analyzed. The results show that Scirrotherium is paraphyletic if we include all its referred species, i.e., Scirrotherium hondaensis, S. carinatum and S. antelucanus. The species S. carinatum is closer to Kraglievichia paranensis than to S. hondaensis or S. antelucanus, therefore the new name K. carinatum comb. nov. is proposed. The relationship among S. hondaensis and S. antelucanus could not be resolved, so these species should be designated in aphyly. In spite of failing to recover S. hondaensis and S. antelucanus as one single clade, here is preferred to maintain the generic name Scirrotherium in both species based on diagnostic evidence. New emended diagnoses for Scirrotherium, S. hondaensis and Kraglievichia are provided. The genus Holmesina was found to be monophyletic and positioned as the sister clade of Scirrotherium + Kraglievichia. The evolutionary and biogeographic implications of the new phylogeny and taxonomic re-arrangements are discussed. A possible geographic origin of the family Pampatheriidae and Scirrotherium in low latitudes of South America as early as Early Miocene times is claimed. The South American ancestor or sister taxon of Holmesina is predicted to be morphologically more similar to Scirrotherium than to Kraglievichia.View Full Text",

Mutations in Atpat5 and Atpat9 resulted in an elevated plant immune response, increased phosphorylation and decreased degradation of FLS2, P2K1 and CERK1 during immune signaling. Mutation of key cysteine residues S-acylated in these receptors resulted in a similar phenotype as exhibited by Atpat5/Atpat9 mutant plants. The data indicate that S-acylation also controls localization of the receptors in distinct PM nanodomains and, thereby, controls the formation of specific protein-protein interactions. Our study reveals that S-acylation plays a critical role in mediating spatiotemporal dynamics of plant receptors within PM nanodomains, suggesting a key role for this modification in regulating the ability of plants in respond to external stimuli.",

However, aggression in females has been largely ignored, and variation in aggressive behaviors between more distantly-related taxa is not well understood despite its potential impact in a complex community structure. To better understand variation in patterns of aggression between species, we presented males and females from five species of Lake Malawi cichlid with a non-predator intruder and recorded all movement and aggressive acts. Additionally, we measured excreted cortisol levels the day after the intruder assay to evaluate one physiological aspect of stress response. We identified species-specific patterns in both specific aggressive acts, and overall level of aggression. Additionally, we found that sexual dimorphism in aggressive acts varies by species and act, where the species with the most aggressive males also has aggressive females. Additionally, cortisol levels vary by taxa, and are associated with restless behavior in the intruder assay, but not levels of aggression. These findings have bearing on understanding sex differences in aggression and their impact on community structure in this important model of rapid evolution.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies profile gene expression patterns in individual cells. It is often of interest to test for differential expression (DE) between conditions, e.g. treatment vs control or between cell types. Simulation studies have shown that non-parametric tests, such as the Wilcoxon-rank sum test, can robustly detect significant DE, with better performance than many parametric tools specifically developed for scRNA-seq data analysis. However, these rank tests cannot be used for complex experimental designs involving multiple groups, multiple factors and confounding variables. Further, rank based tests do not provide an interpretable measure of the effect size. We propose a semi-parametric approach based on probabilistic index models (PIM) that form a flexible class of models that generalize classical rank tests. Our method does not rely on strong distributional assumptions and it allows accounting for confounding factors. Moreover, it allows for the estimation of the effect size in terms of a probabilistic index. Real data analysis demonstrate that PIM is capable of identifying biologically meaningful DE. Our simulation studies also show that DE tests succeed well in controlling the false discovery rate at its nominal level, while maintaining good sensitivity as compared to competing methods.",

    "abstract": "Imaging of complex (biological) samples in the near infrared (nIR) range of the spectrum is beneficial due to reduced light scattering, absorption, phototoxicity and autofluorescence. However, there are only few near infrared fluorescent materials known and suitable for biomedical applications. Here, we exfoliate the layered pigment CaCuSi4O10 (known as Egyptian Blue, EB) via facile tip sonication into nanosheets (EB-NS) with ultra-high nIR fluorescence stability and brightness. The size of EB-NS can be tailored by tip sonication to diameters < 20 nm and heights down to 1 nm. EB-NS fluoresce at 910 nm and the total fluorescence intensity scales with the number of Cu2+ ions that serve as luminescent centers. Furthermore, EB-NS display no bleaching and ultra-high brightness compared to other nIR fluorophores. The versatility of EB-NS is demonstrated by in vivo single-particle tracking and microrheology measurements in developing Drosophila embryos. Additionally, we show that EB-NS can be uptaken by plants and remotely detected in a low cost stand-off detection setup despite strong plant background fluorescence. In summary, EB-NS are a highly versatile, bright, photostable and biocompatible nIR fluorescent material that has the potential for a wide range of bioimaging applications both in animal and plant systems.",

    "abstract": "Sterols are crucial components of biological membranes that help maintain membrane integrity and regulate various processes such as endocytosis, protein oligomerization and signaling. Although synthetized in the ER, sterols are at highest concentrations at the plasma membrane (PM) in all eukaryotic organisms. Here, by applying a genetically encoded sterol biosensor (D4H), we visualize a sterol flow between PM and endosomes in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. While D4H is detected at the PM during steady-state growth, inhibition of Arp2/3-dependent F-actin assembly unexpectedly promotes the reversible re-localization of the probe to internal sterol rich compartments (STRIC), as shown by correlative light-electron microscopy. Time-lapse imaging identifies STRIC as a late secretory, endosomal compartment labelled by the synaptobrevin Syb1. Retrograde sterol internalization to STRIC is independent of endocytosis or an intact Golgi. Instead, it depends on Ltc1, a LAM/StARkin-family protein that localizes to ER-PM contact sites. In ltc1{Delta}, sterols over-accumulate at the PM, which forms extended ER-interacting invaginations, indicating that sterol transfer by Ltc1 contributes to PM size homeostasis. Anterograde sterol movement from STRIC is independent of canonical vesicular trafficking components but requires Arp2/3 activity, suggesting a novel physiological role for this complex. Thus, transfer routes orthogonal to vesicular trafficking govern the retrograde and anterograde flow of sterols in the cell.",

In addition, we examined the fate of retinal progenitor cells when cdkn1c, a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, was induced in clones within wild-type and hdac1 mutant retinae.\\n\\nResultsWe found that seven of the ten mutants examined exhibited apoptosis when grafted into wild-type tissue, with cells from two slowly cycling mutants, elys and emi1, noticeably differentiating in a wild-type environment. Observations of the one hyperproliferative mutant, hdac1, revealed that these mutant cells did not appear to die or differentiate but instead survived and formed tumor-like rosettes in a wild-type environment. Ectopic expression of cdkn1c was unable to force cell cycle exit and differentiation of the majority of hdac1 mutant cells.\\n\\nConclusionsTogether, these results suggest that although a wild-type environment rarely encourages cell cycle exit and differentiation of neural progenitors with cell cycle defects, wild-type survival signals may enable hyperproliferative progenitor cells to persist instead of die.",

    "abstract": "After more than 40 years of stocking, lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in Lake Champlain have started to exhibit strong, natural recruitment. The abrupt surge in recruitment suggests a change in limiting factors such as prey availability or overwinter survival. The distribution of juvenile wild lake trout varies in relative abundance among regions of Lake Champlain. The differences suggest the prey base, or foraging success, may vary geographically within the lake. Stocked and wild lake trout may differ in their ability to use resources and in overwinter survival. One metric that can indicate differences in resources across regions is lake trout lipid content, which reflects the quality of available food and serves as an important energy reserve for overwinter survival. We quantified total lipid content of stocked and wild juvenile lake trout across spatial (lake regions) and temporal (seasonal) scales. No spatial differences in lipid content were apparent. Wild fish had greater lipid content than stocked fish. Seasonally, stocked fish showed a continuous drop in lipid content from pre-winter levels at stocking to the following autumn. Wild fish showed a cyclical summer increase in lipids following winter depletion, which plateaued by autumn. The high lipid content of hatchery lake trout may be necessary as they acclimate to foraging in the wild. Hatcheries would benefit from evaluating whether post-stocking survival could be improved by altering feeding or rearing regimes.",

    "abstract": "Background{beta}-Glucans (BGs), a group of complex non-digestible polysaccharides, are considered to have beneficial health effects due to their immune modulatory properties and are considered as dietary supplements. However, the impact of oral administration of high-pure, well-defined BGs on gut inflammation, and the influence of intestinal microbiota and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) on the therapeutic effect are largely unknown.\\n\\nObjectivesThe aim of this study, using a mouse model of chemical induced colitis, was to investigate the impact of oral administration of high-pure yeast BG (YBG) on the susceptibility to colitis, gut immune function, and structure and function of microbiota.\\n\\nMethodsTo determine the impact of oral administration of YBG on colitis susceptibility, eight week old C57BL/6 (B6) mice were pre-treated with YBG (250 g/mouse/day) and given dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water (2.5% w/v) and examined for the symptoms and features of colitis. To assess the effect of oral administration of YBG on gut mucosa and microbiota structure and function, and gut immune regulation, we determined the microbiota composition, fecal SCFA levels, and intestinal T cell phenotype and cytokine secretion. The role of gut microbiota in YBG treatment induced modulation of gut inflammation and immune function were determined in B6 mice treated with broad-spectrum antibiotic cocktail (1 g/L ampicillin, 0.5 g/L vancomycin, 1 g/L neomycin, and 1 g/L metronidazole) in drinking water.\\n\\nResultsCompared to untreated mice, B6 mice that received prolonged pre-treatment with YBG showed diminished severity of different features of DSS-induced colitis including overall loss of body weight (P<0.001), shortening of colon (P=0.016) and histopathology (P=0.01). However, high-pure YBG has no beneficial effect in terms of suppressing colitis severity when consumed only during the disease stage. Compared to untreated controls, YBG pre-treated mice showed higher regulatory T cell (Treg) frequencies (P=0.043) in the gut mucosa, a shift in the abundance of gut microbiota towards polysaccharide-fermenting bacterial phyla Bacteroides (P=0.049) and Verrucomicrobia (Mean{+/-}SD: control=13.0{+/-}0.33 vs YBG=10.9.7{+/-}0.69) and diminished Firmicutes (P<0.001) and Proteobacteria (P<0.001), and significantly higher production of SCFA such as acetic acid (P=0.016), propionic acid (P=0.026) and butyric acid (P=0.013). Depletion of gut microbiota in YBG-fed B6 mice using broad spectrum antibiotics caused not only elimination of YBG treatment associated SCFA production and Treg increase, but also profound aggravation of the pathological features of colitis such as loss of body weight (P<0.01) and colonic inflammation (P=0.04) compared to that of YBG treated control mice.\\n\\nConclusionsOral consumption of high-pure BG promotes a healthy gut homeostasis and immune regulation, and minimizes susceptibility to DSS induced colitis in B6 mice in a microbiota (and microbial SCFA) - dependent manner. On the contrary, YBG consumption when gut mucosa and microbiota are compromised not only reverses this protection but also increases the susceptibility to gut inflammation and disease severity, perhaps through its direct interaction with gut immune cells. In conclusion, while YBG consumption may be beneficial for gut health and to prevent gut inflammation in healthy individuals and under intact microbiota, this immune stimulatory dietary supplement may not have any health benefits in individuals with active gut inflammation and could cause adverse effect in those who are on oral antibiotics.",

Serotypes, sequence types and antibiotic resistance were inferred from genomes. Phylogeny was built based on single-nucleotide variants. Temporal changes of spread were reconstructed using a birth-death model.\\n\\nResultsWe identified tet(S/M) in 131 pneumococcal isolates, 97 (74%) caused invasive pneumococcal diseases among young children (59% HIV-positive, where HIV status was available) in South Africa. A majority of tet(S/M)-positive isolates (129/131) belong to clonal complex (CC)230. A global phylogeny of CC230 (n=389) revealed that tet(S/M)-positive isolates formed a sub-lineage that exhibited multidrug-resistance. Using the genomic data and a birth-death model, we detected an unrecognised outbreak of this sub-lineage in South Africa between 2000 and 2004 with an expected secondary infections (R) of ~2.5. R declined to ~1.0 in 2005 and <1.0 in 2012.

Although rare, sustained HBsAg loss is the idealized endpoint of any CHB therapy. A novel small molecule RG7834 has been previously reported to inhibit HBsAg expression by targeting terminal nucleotidyltransferase protein 4A and 4B (TENT4A and TENT4B). In this study, we describe a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify other potential novel host factors required for HBsAg expression and to gain further insights into the mechanism of RG7834. We report more than 60 genes involved in regulating HBsAg and identified novel factors involved in RG7834 activity, including a zinc finger CCHC-type containing 14 (ZCCHC14) protein. We show that ZCCHC14, together with TENT4A/B, stabilizes HBsAg expression through HBV RNA tailing, providing a potential new therapeutic target to achieve functional cure in CHB patients.",

    "abstract": "Migraine is a common and disabling neurological disorder. The headache and sensory amplifications that characterize migraine are attributed to hyperexcitable sensory circuits, but a detailed understanding remains elusive. This is partly due to the paucity of genetic animal models associated with the common, less severe form of the disease. A mutation in casein kinase 1 delta (CK1{delta}) was identified in familial migraine with aura and advanced sleep phase syndrome. Spreading depolarization (SD), the phenomenon that underlies migraine aura, is facilitated in mice carrying one of the mutations (CK1{delta}T44A). However, the mechanism of this susceptibility is not known. We used a combination of whole-cell electrophysiology and imaging, in vivo and in ex vivo brain slices, to understand the cellular and synaptic underpinnings of this apparent circuit excitability. We found that despite normal synaptic activity and hyperpolarized neuronal membrane potentials at rest, CK1{delta}T44A neurons were more excitable upon repetitive stimulation compared to wild-type (WT) controls. This was due to reduced presynaptic adaptation to high-frequency stimuli at excitatory, but not inhibitory synapses. Reduced adaptation at glutamatergic CK1{delta}T44A synapses was mediated by a calcium-dependent enhancement of the size of the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles. This caused an increase in the cumulative amplitude of excitatory currents, and a higher excitation-to-inhibition ratio during sustained activity, both in vivo and in brain slices. Fluorescence imaging revealed increased glutamate release in CK1{delta}T44A compared to WT brain slices, corroborating the presynaptic gain of function observed with electrophysiology. Action potential bursts elicited in individual CK1{delta}T44A neurons enhanced glutamatergic feedback excitation within local microcircuits, further amplifying firing frequencies. At a network level in vivo, CK1{delta}T44A mice showed increased duration of up state activity, which is dependent on recurrent excitation. Finally, we demonstrated that SD susceptibility of CK1{delta}T44A brain slices could be returned to WT levels with the same reductions in extracellular calcium that normalized presynaptic adaptation. Taken together, these findings show a stimulus-dependent presynaptic gain of function at glutamatergic synapses in a genetic model of migraine, that accounts for the increased SD susceptibility and may also explain the sensory amplifications that are associated with the disease.",

Leveraging the induced pluripotent stem cell technology, from a cohort of patients with the common pathogenic m.3243A>G variant of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), we differentiated excitatory cortical neurons (iNeurons) with normal (low heteroplasmy) and impaired (high heteroplasmy) mitochondrial function on an isogenic nuclear DNA background. iNeurons with high levels of heteroplasmy exhibited mitochondrial dysfunction, delayed neural maturation, reduced dendritic complexity and fewer functional excitatory synapses. Micro-electrode array recordings of neuronal networks with high heteroplasmy displayed reduced network activity and decreased synchronous network bursting. The impaired neural energy metabolism of iNeurons compromising the structural and functional integrity of neurons and neural networks, could be the primary driver of increased susceptibility to neuropsychiatric manifestations of mitochondrial disease.",

    "abstract": "Research on the mechanisms of ageing has identified ways via which lifespan can be extended in model organisms, increasing the potential for translation of these findings to our own species. However, the large majority of research on animal models involves dietary, genetic or pharmacological treatments throughout life - limiting translational potential and ignoring age-dependent effects. Previously, we have suggested using demographic meta-analysis that reduced mTor signalling has the potential to instantly rejuvenate. We have now tested this prediction experimentally using large-scale demographic data (N > 10,000) combined with conditional knockdown of mTor in Drosophila melanogaster. Indeed, reduced mTor decreased mortality rate when applied during old age. Interestingly, we found that transient treatment during early adult life had long-lasting benefits. Age-dependent deep-RNAseq indicated that these effects arose from distinct physiology and implicate alternative splicing as a potential mechanism for the long-lasting benefits of transient mTor reduction. These findings suggest that reducing mTor short term or during old age could be used to combat ageing. In addition, our findings suggest that the results from experimental research on mTor signalling, and potentially other mechanisms of ageing, that employ life-long interventions are likely to be a complex composite of age-dependent effects that counteract or enhance each other.",

    "abstract": "Fine fescues (Festuca L., Poaceae) are turfgrass species that perform well in low-input environments. Based on morphological characteristics, the most commonly-utilized fine fescues are divided into five taxa: three are subspecies within F. rubra L. and the remaining two are treated as species within the F. ovina L. complex. Morphologically, these five taxa are very similar, both identification and classification of fine fescues remain challenging. In an effort to develop identification methods for fescues, we used flow cytometry to estimate genome size, ploidy level, and sequenced the chloroplast genome of all five taxa. Fine fescue chloroplast genome sizes ranged from 133,331 to 133,841 bp and contained 113 to 114 genes. Phylogenetic relationship reconstruction using whole chloroplast genome sequences agreed with previous work based on morphology. Comparative genomics suggested unique repeat signatures for each fine fescue taxon that could potentially be used for marker development for taxon identification.",

    "abstract": "PDZ domains are small protein-binding domains that interact with short, mostly C-terminal peptides and play important roles in cellular signaling and the trafficking and localization of ion channels. The CFTR-associated ligand PDZ domain (CALP) binds to the cystic fibro-sis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and mediates degradation of mature CFTR through lysosomal pathways. Inhibition of the CALP:CFTR interaction has been explored as a potential therapeutic avenue for cystic fibrosis (CF).1 Previously, we reported2 the ensemble-based computational design of a novel 6-residue peptide inhibitor of CALP, which resulted in the most binding-efficient inhibitor of CALP to date. This inhibitor, kCAL01, was designed using OSPREY3 and displayed significant biological activity in in vitro cell-based assays. Here, we report a crystal structure of kCAL01 bound to CALP (PDB ID: 6OV7). To elucidate the structural basis for the enhanced binding efficiency of kCAL01, we compare this structure to that of a previously developed inhibitor of CALP, iCAL36 (PDB ID: 4E34). In addition to per-forming traditional structural analysis, we compute the side-chain energy landscapes for each structure using the recently developed MARK* partition function approximation algorithm.4 Analysis of these energy landscapes not only enables approximation of binding thermodynamics for these structural models of CALP:inhibitor binding, but also foregrounds important structural features and reveals dynamic features, both of which contribute to the comparatively efficient binding of kCAL01. The investigation of energy landscapes complements traditional analysis of the few low-energy conformations found in crystal structures, and provides information about the entire conformational ensemble that is accessible to a protein structure model. Finally, we compare the previously reported NMR-based design model ensemble for kCAL01 vs. the new crystal structure and show that, despite the notable differences between the CALP NMR model and crystal structure, many significant features are successfully captured in the design ensemble. This suggests not only that ensemble-based design captured thermodynamically significant features observed in vitro, but also that a design algorithm eschewing ensembles would likely miss the kCAL01 sequence entirely.\\n\\nGraphical TOC Entry\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=82 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/720342v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (27K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2a1036org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18e5fe0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@38ab86org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@84f1b5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Core histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 are encoded by a large family of genes distributed across the human genome. Canonical core histones contribute the majority of proteins to bulk chromatin packaging, and are encoded in 4 clusters by 65 coding genes comprising 17 for H2A, 18 for H2B, 15 for H3, and 15 for H4, along with at least 17 total pseudogenes. The canonical core histone genes display coding variation that gives rise to 11 H2A, 15 H2B, 4 H3, and 2 H4 unique protein isoforms. Although histone proteins are highly conserved overall, these isoforms represent a surprising and seldom recognised variation with amino acid identity as low as 77% between canonical histone proteins of the same type. The gene sequence and protein isoform diversity also exceeds commonly used subtype designations such as H2A.1 and H3.1, and exists in parallel with the well-known specialisation of variant histone proteins. RNA sequencing of histone transcripts shows evidence for differential expression of histone genes but the functional significance of this variation has not yet been investigated. To assist understanding of the implications of histone gene and protein diversity we have catalogued the entire human canonical core histone gene and protein complement. In order to organise this information in a robust, accessible, and accurate form, we applied software build automation tools to dynamically generate the canonical core histone repertoire based on current genome annotations and then to organise the information into a manuscript format. Automatically generated values are shown with a light grey background. Alongside recognition of the encoded protein diversity, this has led to multiple corrections to human histone annotations, reflecting the flux of the human genome as it is updated and enriched in reference databases. This dynamic manuscript approach is inspired by the aims of reproducible research and can be readily adapted to other gene families.",

    "abstract": "When facing decisions involving trade-offs between smaller, sooner and larger, delayed rewards, people tend to discount the value of future rewards. There are substantial individual differences in this tendency toward temporal discounting, however. One neurocognitive system that may underlie these individual differences is episodic memory, given the overlap in the neural circuitry involved in imagining the future and remembering the past. Here we tested this hypothesis in older adults, including both those that were cognitively normal and those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We found that performance on neuropsychological measures of episodic memory retrieval was associated with temporal discounting, such that people with better memory discounted delayed rewards less. This relationship was specific to episodic memory and temporal discounting, since executive function (another cognitive ability) was unrelated to temporal discounting, and episodic memory was unrelated to risk tolerance (another decision-making preference). We also examined cortical thickness and volume in medial temporal lobe regions critical for episodic memory. Entorhinal cortical thickness was associated with reduced temporal discounting, with episodic memory performance partially mediating this association. The inclusion of MCI participants was critical to revealing these associations between episodic memory and entorhinal cortical thickness and temporal discounting. These effects were larger in the MCI group, reduced after controlling for MCI status, and statistically significant only when including MCI participants in analyses. Overall, these findings suggest that individual differences in temporal discounting are driven by episodic memory function, and that a decline in medial temporal lobe structural integrity may impact temporal discounting.",

KIF20A, a motor protein of the kinesin-6 family, is overexpressed in bladder cancer, and KIF20A levels correlate negatively with the clinical outcome. We report here a new role for the KIF20A kinesin motor protein in intracellular mechanics. Using optical tweezers to probe intracellular mechanics and surface AFM to probe cortical mechanics, we first confirm that bladder cells soften with increasing cancer grade. We then show that inhibiting KIF20A makes the intracellular environment softer for both high and low grade bladder cancer cells. Upon inhibition of KIF20A cortical stiffness also decreases in lower grade cells, while it surprisingly increases in higher grade malignant cells. Changes in cortical stiffness correlate with the interaction of KIF20A with myosin IIA. Moreover, KIF20A negatively regulates bladder cancer cell motility irrespective of the underlying substrate stiffness. Our results reveal a central role for a microtubule motor in cell mechanics and migration in the context of bladder cancer.",

The number of live bacteria was increased approximately five-fold in the gut of aged parkin null animals. Conditional RNAi showed that parkin is required in gut enterocytes and not in neurons or muscle to maintain microbial load homeostasis.

It has long been recognized bone marrow niche parameters interact with hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and additional work is required to study niche physical signals controlling cell behavior. Here we presented that important biophysical signals, stiffness and dimensionality, regulating expansion of bone marrow HSPCs. Mice bone marrow derived progenitor cells were cultured in collagen I hydrogel in vitro. We found stiffer 3D matrix promoted the expansion of lineage negative (Lin-) progenitor cells and Lin-Sca-1+c-kit+ (LSK) HSPCs compared to softer hydrogel. Compared with cells cultured in 2D environment, 3D embedded construct had significant advantage on HSPCs expansion, accompanied by increases on myeloid and lymphoid lineage fractions. Bright changes on gene expression were subsequently discovered. According to these data, we concluded that culture matrix dimensionality is an important factor to regulate the behavior of subpopulations in hematopoietic cell pool, which should be considered in attempts to illuminate HSCs fate decision in vitro.\\n\\nStatement of SignificanceWe would like to submit the enclosed manuscript entitled \\\"Importance of Niche-dimensionality in Regulating the Bone Marrow Hematopoietic Cells Pool\\\", which we wish to be considered for publication in Biophysical Journal. Studies about the interaction between HSCs and factors provided by their microenvironment is largely focus on pure perspective of biology. But biophysical factors affecting HSC fate and behavior needs to be further explore. Herein we found ex vivo culture dimensionality affected HSPC expansion. Cell surface marker detection and mRNA expression analysis predicted the changes on myeloid and lymphoid lineage fractions. We hope niche physical signals which we identified will be considered to design HSC biomimetic niches in clinical applications. And we believe that our study will make it interesting to general readers. We deeply appreciate your consideration of our manuscript, and we look forward to receiving comments from the reviewers.",

    "abstract": "In the natural world, sex prevails, despite its costs. While much effort has been dedicated to identifying the intrinsic costs of sex (e.g. the cost of males), few studies have identified the ecological fitness consequences of sex. Furthermore, correlated biological traits that differ between sexuals and asexuals may alter these costs, or even render the typical costs of sex irrelevant. Here we use a large-scale transplant experiment of a North American wildflower to show that sex is associated with reduced lifetime fitness, despite lower herbivory. We separate the effects of sex from hybridity, finding that over-winter survival is elevated in asexuals regardless of hybridity, but herbivores target hybrid asexuals. Survival is lowest in homozygous sexual lineages, implicating inbreeding depression as a cost of sex. Our results show that the consequences of sex are shaped by complex natural environments, correlated traits, and the identity of mates, rather than sex itself.",

Such compensatory alleles can segregate in interpopulation hybrids, causing segregation variance for traits where parents have the same phenotype. If adaptation typically involves pleiotropy and compensation, then the segregation variance for traits under stabilizing selection is expected to increase with the magnitude of adaptive phenotypic divergence between parents. This prediction has not been tested empirically, and I gathered data from experimental hybridization studies to evaluate it. I found that pairs of parents which are more phenotypically divergent beget hybrids with more segregation variance in traits where the parents do not differ. This result suggests that adaptive divergence between pairs of natural populations proceeds via pleiotropy and compensation, and that potentially deleterious transgressive segregation variance accumulates systematically as populations diverge.",

    "abstract": "Kinetoplastids rely heavily on post-transcriptional mechanisms for control of gene expression, and on RNA-binding proteins that regulate mRNA splicing, translation and decay. Trypanosoma brucei ERBP1 (Tb927.10.14150) and ERBP2 (Tb927.9.9550) were previously identified as mRNA binding proteins that lack canonical RNA-binding domains. We here show that ERBP1 is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, like ERBP2, and that the two proteins interact in vivo. Loss of ERBP1 from bloodstream-form T. brucei initially resulted in a growth defect but proliferation was restored after more prolonged cultivation. Results from a pull-down of tagged ERBP1 suggest that it preferentially binds to ribosomal protein mRNAs. The ERBP1 sequence resembles that of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Bfr1, which also localises to the endoplasmic reticulum and binds to ribosomal protein mRNAs. However, unlike Bfr1, ERBP1 does not bind to mRNAs encoding secreted proteins, and it is also not recruited to stress granules after starvation.",

    "abstract": "To characterize RNA-capsid binding sites genome-wide within mature RNA virus particles, we have developed a Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform: Photo-Activatable Ribonucleoside Cross-Linking (PAR-CL). In PAR-CL, 4-thiouracil is incorporated into the encapsidated genomes of authentic virus particles and subsequently UV-crosslinked to adjacent capsid proteins. We demonstrate that PAR-CL can readily and reliably identify capsid binding sites in genomic viral RNA by detecting crosslink-specific uridine to cytidine transitions in NGS data. Using Flock House virus (FHV) as a model system, we identified highly consistent and significant PAR-CL signals across virus RNA genome indicating a clear tropism of the encapsidated RNA genome. Certain interaction sites correlate to previously identified FHV RNA motifs. We additionally performed dimethyl sulfate mutational profiling with sequencing (DMS-MaPseq) to generate a high-resolution profile of single-stranded genomic RNA inside viral particles. Combining PAR-CL and DMS-MaPseq reveals that the predominant RNA-capsid sites favor double-stranded RNA regions. We disrupted secondary structures associated with PAR-CL sites using synonymous mutations, resulting in varied effects to virus replication, propagation, and packaging. Certain mutations showed substantial deficiency in virus replication, suggesting these RNA-capsid sites are multifunctional. These provide further evidence to support that FHV packaging and replication are highly coordinated and inter-dependent events.\\n\\nImportanceIcosahedral RNA viruses must package their genetic cargo into the restrictive and tight confines of the protected virions. High resolution structures of RNA viruses have been solved by Cryo-EM and crystallography, but the encapsidated RNA often eluded visualization due to the icosahedral averaging imposed during image reconstruction. Asymmetrical reconstructions of some icosahedral RNA virus particles have revealed that the encapsidated RNAs conform to specific structures, which may be related to programmed assembly pathway or an energy-minima for RNA folding during or after encapsidation. Despite these advances, determining whether encapsidated RNA genomes conform to a single structure and determining what regions of the viral RNA genome interact with the inner surface of the capsid shell remains challenging. Furthermore, it remains to be determined whether there exists a single RNA structure with conserved topology in RNA virus particles or an ensemble of genomic RNA structures. This is important as resolving these features will inform the elusive structures of the asymmetrically encapsidated genomic material and how virus particles are assembled.",

To identify gene regulatory networks that control neuronal reprogramming in retinal glia, we comprehensively profiled injury-dependent changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility in Muller glia from zebrafish, chick and mice using bulk RNA-Seq and ATAC-Seq, as well as single-cell RNA-Seq. Cross-species integrative analysis of these data, together with functional validation, identified evolutionarily conserved and species-specific gene networks controlling glial quiescence, gliosis and neurogenesis. In zebrafish and chick, transition from the resting state to gliosis is essential for initiation of retinal regeneration, while in mice a dedicated network suppresses neurogenic competence and restores quiescence. Selective disruption of NFI family transcription factors, which maintain and restore quiescence, enables Muller glia to proliferate and generate neurons in adult mice following retinal injury. These findings may aid in the design of cell-based therapies aimed at restoring retinal neurons lost to degenerative disease.\n\nSummary sentenceThis study identifies gene regulatory networks controlling proliferative and neurogenic competence in retinal Muller glia.",

Here, we test  burstlet theory (Kam, Worrell, Janczewski, et al. 2013), which posits that low amplitude burstlets, subthreshold from the standpoint of inspiratory bursts, reflect the fundamental oscillator of the preBotC. In turn, a discrete suprathreshold process transforms burstlets into full amplitude inspiratory bursts that drive motor output, measurable via hypoglossal nerve (XII) discharge in vitro. We recap observations by Kam & Feldman: field recordings from preBotC demonstrate bursts and concurrent XII motor output intermingled with lower amplitude burstlets that do not produce XII motor output. Manipulations of excitability affect the relative prevalence of bursts and burstlets and modulate their frequency. Whole-cell and photonic recordings of preBotC neurons suggest that burstlets involve inconstant subsets of rhythmogenic interneurons. We conclude that discrete rhythm- and pattern-generating mechanisms coexist in the preBotC and that burstlets reflect its fundamental rhythmogenic nature.",

Among bacteria, \\\"adder\\\" behavior in which a constant size appears to be added during each cell cycle is ubiquitous, while various eukaryotes show other size-homeostasis behaviors. Since interactions between cell-cycle progression and growth ultimately determine size-homeostasis behaviors, we developed a general model of cell proliferation to: 1) discover how the requirement of cell-size homeostasis limits mechanisms of cell-cycle control; 2) predict how features of cell-cycle control translate into size-homeostasis measurements. Our analyses revealed plausible cell-cycle control scenarios that nevertheless fail to regulate cell size, conditions that generate apparent adder behavior without underlying adder mechanisms, cell-cycle features that play unintuitive roles in causing deviations from adder, and distinguishing predictions for extended size-homeostasis statistics according to the underlying control mechanism. The model thus provides holistic insight into the mechanistic implications of cell-size homeostasis measurements.",

Several inductive signals regulate liver development, yet the pure nascent hepatic and gallbladder cells are unable to be isolated due to limited cell markers and cell numbers. The transcriptome networks of the hepatic lineage in the endoderm, and how the gallbladder differentiates from the adjacent endoderm population, are not fully understood. Using a transgenic Foxa2eGFP reporter mouse line, we performed deep single-cell RNA sequencing on 1,966 individual cells, including nascent hepatic and gallbladder cells, isolated from the endoderm and hepatic regions from ten embryonic stages, ranging from day E7.5 to E15.5. We identified the embryonic liver developmental trajectory from primitive streak to hepatoblasts and characterized the transcriptome of the hepatic lineage. During pre-hepatogenesis (5-6 somite stage), we have identified two groups of foregut endoderm cells, one derived from visceral endoderm and the second derived from primitive streak via a mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET). During the liver specification stages, liver primordium was identified to share both foregut and liver features. We also documented dynamic gene expression during the epithelial-hepatic transition (EHT). Six gene groups were found to switch on or off at different stages during liver specification. Importantly, we found that RXR complex signaling and newly identified transcription factors associated with liver specification. Moreover, we revealed the gallbladder primordium cells at E9.5 and found genes that transcriptionally distinguish them from the liver primordium.

    "abstract": "Spatial light modulation using cost efficient digital mirror arrays (DMA) is finding broad applications in fluorescence microscopy due to the reduction of phototoxicity and bleaching and the ability to manipulate proteins in optogenetic experiments. However, the precise calibration of DMAs and their application to single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) remained a challenge because of non-linear distortions between the DMA and camera coordinate system caused by optical components. Here we develop a fast and easy to implement calibration procedure that determines these distortions by means of an optical feedback and matches the DMA and camera coordinate system with ~50 nm precision. As a result, a region from a fluorescence image can be selected with a higher precision for illumination compared to manual alignment of the DMA. We first demonstrate the application of our precisely calibrated light modulation by performing a proof-of concept fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiment with the endoplasmic reticulum-localized protein IRE1 fused to GFP. Next, we develop a spatial feedback photoactivation approach for SMLM in which only regions of the cell are selected for photoactivation that contain photoactivatable fluorescent proteins. The reduced exposure of the cells to 405 nm light increases the possible imaging time by 44% until phototoxic effects cause a dominant fluorescence background and a change in the cells morphology. As a result, the mean number of reliable single molecule localizations is also significantly increased by 28%. Since the localization precision and the ability for single molecule tracking is not altered compared to traditional photoactivation of the entire field of view, spatial feedback photoactivation significantly improves the quality of SMLM images and the precision of single molecule tracking. Our calibration method therefore lays the foundation for improved SMLM with active feedback photoactivation far beyond the applications in this work.\\n\\nStatement of significanceActively patterned illumination in fluorescence microscopy can reduce bleaching and phototoxicity as well as actively manipulate proteins in optogenetic applications. Matching the coordinate system of the camera and the light patterning device such as digital mirror arrays (DMA) remains a challenge. We developed a fast and easy calibration procedure that determines and corrects for the transformation between the camera and DMA coordinate system with ~50 nm precision. Using this approach, we develop spatial feedback photoactivation for Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) to photoswitch only intracellular regions containing photoswitchable fluorophores. Our results show a 44% improvement in the possible data acquisition time before phototoxic effects become detectable and a 28% increase in detected localizations. Spatial feedback photoactivation thus significantly improves SMLM experiments.",

One of these regions is bordered by the Caribbean Sea, and the surrounding landscape may play an important role in the dispersion of C. posadasii across South America through southeastern Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala and Venezuela. Comparative phylogenomic analyses of C. posadasii reveal that clinical strains from Venezuela are genetically distinct from the North American populations found in Arizona (AZ), Texas, Mexico, and the rest of South America (TX/MX/SA). We find evidence for admixture between the Venezuela and the North American populations of C. posadasii in Central America. As expected, the proportion of Venezuelan alleles in the admixed population decreases as latitude (and distance from Venezuela) increases. Our results indicate that the population in Venezuela may have been subjected to a recent bottleneck, and shows strong population structure.

    "abstract": "Brain lesion and stimulation studies have suggested posterior parietal cortex and the medial intraparietal sulcus in particular as a crucial hub for online movement error corrections. However, causal evidence for this is still sparse. Indeed, lesion studies are potentially confounded by compensatory reorganization mechanisms while brain stimulation studies have produced heterogeneous results when employing transcranial magnetic stimulation. Here we designed a new complementary paradigm using fMRI-guided high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) of the left medial intraparietal sulcus (mIPS) together with regression-based mediation analysis to re-examine the causal role of mIPS in online reach corrections to jumping targets. We obtained two independent measures of stimulation-induced changes in brain activity by modeling current flow in the brain and through EEG recordings before and after HD-tDCS stimulation. Third, to quantify behavioral effects of HD-tDCS we computed movement curvature as a measure of online correction. We demonstrate that both of our measurements of brain activity were consistent with a polarity-specific modulation of the online correction for targets jumping to the contralateral side of the stimulation. Importantly, using a mediation analysis of the relationship between stimulation current and movement curvature suggests that the induced current modifies brain activity, which then leads to the observed behavioral changes. This unique combination of methods and analysis thus provides complementary evidence for the crucial role of the posterior parietal cortex in online error correction, while at the same time setting a new methodological standard with respect to the causal influence of transcranial direct current stimulation.\n\nNew & NoteworthyTranscranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is an interesting and potentially useful tool for asking causal scientific questions and design clinical treatments. With our unique combination of highly accurate fMRI guided stimulation, current forward modeling, EEG recordings before and after the stimulation and behavioral changes we could unravel the causal structure of tDCS. Our approach naturally deals with the variability of tDCS results, increasing its potential usefulness as a tool for research and clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) are fundamental components of biological regulation, facilitating the basal and differential gene expression necessary for life. TFs exert transcriptional regulation through interactions with both DNA and other TFs, ultimately influencing the action of RNA polymerase at a genomic locus. Current approaches are proficient at identification of binding site requirements for individual TFs, but few methods have been adapted to study oligomeric TF complexes. Further, many approaches that have been turned toward understanding DNA binding of TF complexes, such as electrophoretic mobility shift assays, require protein purification steps that can be burdensome or scope-limiting when considering more exhaustive experimental design. In order to address these shortfalls and to facilitate a more streamlined approach to understanding DNA binding by TF complexes, we developed the DIMR (Dynamic, Interdependent TF binding Molecular Reporter) system, a modular, yeast-based synthetic transcriptional activity reporter. As a proof of concept, we focused on the NUCLEAR FACTOR-Y (NF-Y) family of obligate heterotrimeric TFs in Arabidopsis thaliana. The DIMR system was able to reproduce the strict DNA-binding requirements of an experimentally validated NF-YA2/B2/C3 complex with high fidelity, including recapitulation of previously characterized mutations in subunits that either break NF-Y complex interactions or are directly involved in DNA binding. The DIMR system is a novel, powerful, and easy-to-use approach to address questions regarding the binding of oligomeric TFs to DNA.\\n\\nOne sentence summaryThe DIMR system provides an accessible and easy-to-use platform to elucidate DNA binding and transcriptional regulatory capacity of oligomeric transcription factor complexes",

Here we conducted genome-wide association analyses in UK Biobank (N=22,179), the largest single study with consistent cIMT measurements.\\n\\nApproach and resultsWe used BOLT-LMM to run linear regression of cIMT in UK Biobank, adjusted for age, sex, genotyping platform and population structure. In white British participants, we identified 4 novel loci associated with cIMT and replicated most previously reported loci. In the first sex-specific analyses of cIMT, we identified a female-specific locus on Chromosome 5, associated with cIMT in women only and highlight VCAN as a good candidate gene at this locus. Genetic correlations with body-mass index and glucometabolic traits were also observed.\\n\\nConclusionThese findings replicate previously reported associations, highlight novel biology and provide new directions for investigating the sex differences observed in cardiovascular disease presentation and progression.",

This tissue is responsible for making and secreting seminal fluid proteins and other molecules that contribute to successful reproduction. Here we show that similar to the mammalian prostate, this tissue grows with age and can undergo functional regeneration post-damage. We describe a post-eclosion endocycle required for gland maturation, that is dependent on juvenile hormone signaling. In addition, the differentiated binucleated main cells of the adult accessory gland continue to undergo rare endocycles throughout physiological aging to increase DNA content and cell size. Accessory gland cells remain poised to endocycle and upregulation of signals that promote endocycling and tissue growth are sufficient to trigger dramatic increases in cell ploidy. We provide evidence that the main cells of this tissue remain poised to enter the endocycle to assist in tissue regrowth after damage, providing a novel model for postmitotic regeneration in a binucleate tissue.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo evaluate the efficacy of a synthetic sex-aggregation pheromone of the sand fly vector Lu. longipalpis, co-located with residual insecticide, to reduce the infection incidence of Leishmania infantum in the canine reservoir, and to reduce sand fly vector abundance. To compare the outcomes to those resulting from fitting deltamethrin-impregnated collars to the canine reservoir.\\n\\nMethodsA stratified cluster-randomised trial was designed to detect a 50% reduction in canine incident infection after 24 months in 42 recruited clusters, randomly assigned to one of three intervention arms (14 cluster each): pheromone + insecticide, insecticide-impregnated dog collars, or placebo control. Infection incidence was measured by seroconversion to anti-Leishmania antibody, Leishmania parasite detection and canine tissue parasite loads. Changes in relative Lu. longipalpis abundance within households were measured by setting three CDC light traps per household.\\n\\nResultsA total 1,454 seronegative dogs were follow-up for a median 15.2 (95% C.I.s: 14.6, 16.2) months per cluster. The pheromone + insecticide intervention provided 13% (95% C.I. 0%, 44.0%) protection against anti-Leishmania antibody seroconversion, 52% (95% C.I. 6.2%, 74{middle dot}9%) against parasite infection, reduced tissue parasite loads by 53% (95% C.I. 5.4%, 76.7%), and reduced household female sand fly abundance by 49% (95% C.I. 8.2%, 71.3%). Variation in the efficacy against seroconversion varied between trial strata. Equivalent protection attributed to the impregnated-collars were 36% (95% C.I. 14.4%, 51.8%), 23% (95% C.I. 0%, 57{middle dot}5%), 48% (95% C.I. 0%, 73.4%) and 43% (95% C.I. 0%, 67.9%), respectively. Comparison of the outcomes of the two interventions showed no statistically consistent differences in their efficacies; however, the errors were broad for all outcomes. Reductions in sand fly numbers were predominant where insecticide was located (chicken and dog sleeping sites), with no evidence of insecticide-induced repellency onto humans or dogs.\\n\\nConclusionThe synthetic pheromone lure-and-kill approach provides protection particularly against L. infantum parasite transmission and sand fly vector abundance. The effect estimates are not dissimilar to those of the insecticide-impregnated collars, which are documented to reduce canine infection incidence, and human infection and clinical VL disease incidence, in different global regions. As a low-cost alternative or complimentary vector control tool, optimisation of best community deployment of the pheromone + insecticide are now underway.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe sand fly vector of the intracellular parasite Leishmania infantum causing human and canine visceral leishmaniasis in the Americas is Lutzomyia longipalpis. Dogs are the proven reservoir. Vector control tools to reduce transmission suited to this predominantly exophilic vector are lacking. Insecticide-impregnated dog collars protect dogs against infectious bites from sand fly vectors, resulting in reductions of new infections in both dogs and humans. However, collars are costly particularly for endemic communities, and alternative approaches are needed. Recent bulk synthesis of a sex-aggregation pheromone produced by male Lu. longipalpis was shown to attract large numbers of conspecific females to lethal pyrethroid insecticides. This study, conducted in Brazil, evaluated the efficacy of this novel lure-and-kill approach to reduce seroconversion and infection incidence with L. infantum in the canine reservoir, in addition to measuring its impact on household abundance of Lu. longipalpis. Deployed in 14 stratified clusters, the outcomes were compared to those resulting attributed to the collars fitted to dogs in another 14 clusters; each intervention was compared to the 14 clusters that received placebo treatments. The beneficial effects of the lure-and-kill method were most noticeable on confirmed infection incidence and clinical parasite loads, and in reducing sand fly abundance. The overall effect of the two interventions were not statistically dissimilar, though the confidence intervals were broad. We conclude that the novel low-cost lure-and-kill approach should be added to the vector control toolbox against visceral leishmaniasis in the Americas.",

    "abstract": "The host plant is often the main variable explaining population structure in fungal plant pathogens, because specialization contributes to reduce gene flow between populations associated with different hosts. Previous population genetic analysis revealed that French populations of the grey mould pathogen Botrytis cinerea were structured by hosts tomato and grapevine, suggesting host specialization in this highly polyphagous pathogen. However, these findings raised questions about the magnitude of this specialization and the possibility of specialization to other hosts. Here we report specialization of B. cinerea populations to tomato and grapevine hosts but not to other tested plants. Population genetic analysis revealed two pathogen clusters associated with tomato and grapevine, while the other clusters co-occurred on hydrangea, strawberry and bramble. Measurements of quantitative pathogenicity were consistent with host specialization of populations found on tomato, and to a lesser extent, populations found on grapevine. Pathogen populations from hydrangea and strawberry appeared to be generalist, while populations from bramble may be weakly specialized. Our results suggest that the polyphagous B. cinerea is more accurately described as a collection of generalist and specialist individuals in populations. This work opens new perspectives for grey mold management, while suggesting spatial optimization of crop organization within agricultural landscapes.",

    "abstract": "Methylation of the small ribosome subunit rRNA in the ribosomal decoding center results in exceptionally high-level aminoglycoside resistance in bacteria. Enzymes that methylate 16S rRNA on N7 of nucleotide G1405 (m7G1405) have been identified in both aminoglycoside-producing and clinically drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria. Using a fluorescence polarization 30S-binding assay and a new crystal structure of the methyltransferase RmtC at 3.14 [A] resolution, here we report a structure-guided functional study of 30S substrate recognition by the aminoglycoside resistance-associated 16S rRNA (m7G1405) methyltransferases. We found that the binding site for these enzymes in the 30S subunit directly overlaps with that of a second family of aminoglycoside resistance-associated 16S rRNA (m1A1408) methyltransferases, suggesting both groups of enzymes may exploit the same conserved rRNA tertiary surface for docking to the 30S. Within RmtC, we defined an N-terminal domain surface, comprising basic residues from both the N1 and N2 subdomains, that directly contributes to 30S-binding affinity. In contrast, additional residues lining a contiguous adjacent surface on the C-terminal domain were critical for 16S rRNA modification, but did not directly contribute to the binding affinity. The results from our experiments define the critical features of m7G1405 methyltransferase-substrate recognition and distinguish at least two distinct, functionally critical contributions of the tested enzyme residues: 30S-binding affinity and stabilizing a binding-induced 16S rRNA conformation necessary for G1405 modification. Our study sets the scene for future high-resolution structural studies of the 30S-methyltransferase complex and for potential exploitation of unique aspects of substrate recognition in future therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Integrated information theory (IIT) postulates that consciousness arises from the cause-effect structure of a system but the optimal network conditions for this structure have not been elucidated. In the study, we test the hypothesis that network criticality, a dynamically balanced state between a large variation of functional network configurations and a large constraint of structural network configurations, is a necessary condition for the emergence of a cause-effect structure that results in a large {Phi}, a surrogate of integrated information. We also hypothesized that if the brain deviates from criticality, the cause-effect structure is obscured and {Phi} diminishes. We tested these hypotheses with a large-scale brain network model and high-density electroencephalography (EEG) acquired during various levels of human consciousness during general anesthesia. In the modeling study, maximal criticality coincided with maximal {Phi}. The constraint of the structural network on the functional network is maximized in the maximal criticality. The EEG study demonstrated an explicit relationship between {Phi}, criticality, and level of consciousness. Functional brain network significantly correlated with structural brain network only in conscious states. The results support the hypothesis that network criticality maximizes {Phi}.",
