    "abstract": "BackgroundResting state fMRI (rsfMRI) demonstrates that the brain is organized into distributed networks. Numerous studies have examined links between psychiatric symptomatology and network functional connectivity. Traditional rsfMRI analyses assume that the spatial organization of networks is invariant between individuals. This dogma has recently been overturned by the demonstration that networks show significant variation between individuals. We tested the hypothesis that previously observed relationships between schizophrenia negative symptom severity and network connectivity are actually due to individual differences in network spatial organization.\\n\\nMethods44 participants diagnosed with schizophrenia underwent rsfMRI scans and clinical assessments. A multivariate pattern analysis determined how whole brain functional connectivity correlates with negative symptom severity at the individual voxel level.\\n\\nResultsBrain connectivity to a region of the right dorso-lateral pre-frontal cortex correlates with negative symptom severity. This finding results from individual differences in the topographic distribution of two networks: the default mode network (DMN) and the task positive network (TPN). Both networks demonstrate strong (r[~]0.49) and significant (p<0.001) relationships between topography and symptom severity. For individuals with low symptom severity, this critical region is part of the DMN. In highly symptomatic individuals, this region is part of the TPN.\\n\\nConclusionPreviously overlooked individual variation in brain organization is tightly linked to differences in schizophrenia symptom severity. Recognizing critical links between network topography and pathological symptomology may identify key circuits that underlie cognitive and behavioral phenotypes. Individual variation in network topography likely guides different responses to clinical interventions that rely on anatomical targeting (e.g. TMS).",

    "abstract": "Loss-of-function (LoF) screenings have the potential to reveal novel cancer-specific vulnerabilities, prioritize drug treatments, and inform precision medicine therapeutics. These screenings were traditionally done using shRNAs, but with the recent emergence of CRISPR technology there has been a shift in methodology. However, recent analyses have found large inconsistencies between CRISPR and shRNA essentiality results. Here, we examined the DepMap project, the largest cancer LoF effort undertaken to date, and find a lack of correlation between CRISPR and shRNA LoF results; we further characterized differences between genes found to be essential by either platform. We then introduce ECLIPSE, a machine learning approach, which combines genomic, cell line, and experimental design features to predict essential genes and platform specific essential genes in specific cancer cell lines. We applied ECLIPSE to known drug targets and found that our approach strongly differentiated drugs approved for cancer versus those that have not, and can thus be leveraged to identify potential cancer repurposing opportunities. Overall, ECLIPSE allows for a more comprehensive analysis of gene essentiality and drug development; which neither platform can achieve alone.",

    "abstract": "Small RNAs (sRNAs) regulate gene expression, play important roles in epigenetic pathways, and have been hypothesised to contribute to hybrid vigor in plants. Prior investigations have provided valuable insights into associations between sRNAs and heterosis, often using a single hybrid genotype or tissue. However, our understanding of the role of sRNAs and their potential value to plant breeding are limited by an incomplete picture of sRNA variation between diverse genotypes and development stages. Here, we provide a deep exploration of sRNA variation and inheritance among a panel of 108 maize samples spanning five tissues from eight inbred parents and 12 hybrid genotypes, covering a spectrum of heterotic groups, genetic variation, and levels of heterosis for various traits. We document substantial developmental and genotypic influences on sRNA expression, with varying patterns for 21-nt, 22-nt and 24-nt sRNAs. We provide a detailed view of the distribution of sRNAs in the maize genome, revealing a complex make-up that also shows developmental plasticity, particularly for 22-nt sRNAs. sRNAs exhibited substantially more variation between inbreds as compared to observed variation for gene expression. In hybrids, we identify locus-specific examples of non-additive inheritance, mostly characterised as partial or complete dominance, but rarely outside the parental range. However, the global abundance of 21-nt, 22-nt and 24-nt sRNAs varies very little between inbreds and hybrids, suggesting that hybridization affects sRNA expression principally at specific loci rather than on a global scale. This study provides a valuable resource for understanding the potential role of sRNAs in hybrid vigor.\\n\\nOne-sentence summaryCharacterizing the roles of development and genotype in driving expression variation of different small RNA populations in maize inbreds and their F1 hybrids.",

    "abstract": "We describe a novel precision medicine workflow, the integrated single nucleotide polymorphism network platform (iSNP), designed to identify the exact mechanisms of how SNPs affect cellular regulatory networks, and how SNP co-occurrences contribute to disease pathogenesis in ulcerative colitis (UC). Using SNP profiles of 377 UC patients, we mapped the regulatory effects of the SNPs to a human signalling network containing protein-protein, miRNA-mRNA and transcription factor binding interactions. Unsupervised clustering algorithms grouped these patient-specific networks into four distinct clusters based on two large disease hubs, NFKB1 and PKCB. Pathway analysis identified the epigenetic modification as common and the T-cell specific responses as differing signalling pathways in the clusters. By integrating individual transcriptomes in active and quiescent disease setting to the patient networks, we validated the impact of non-coding SNPs. The iSNP approach identified regulatory effects of disease-associated non-coding SNPs, and identified how pathogenesis pathways are activated via different genetic modifications.",

    "abstract": "Brain extracellular matrix (ECM) is often overlooked in vitro brain tissue models, despite its instructive roles during development. Using developmental stage-sourced brain ECM in reproducible 3D bioengineered culture systems, we demonstrate enhanced functional differentiation of human induced neural stem cells (hiNSCs) into healthy neurons and astrocytes. Particularly, fetal brain tissue-derived ECM supported long-term maintenance of differentiated neurons, demonstrated by morphology, gene expression and secretome profiling. Astrocytes were evident within the second month of differentiation, and reactive astrogliosis was inhibited in brain ECM-enriched cultures when compared to unsupplemented cultures. Functional maturation of the differentiated hiNSCs within fetal ECM-enriched cultures was confirmed by calcium signaling and unsupervised cluster analysis. Additionally, the study identified native biochemical cues in decellularized ECM with notable comparisons between fetal and adult brain-derived ECMs. The development of novel brain-specific biomaterials for generating mature in vitro brain models provides an important path forward for interrogation of neuron-glia interactions.",

    "abstract": "Retinoblastoma is a pediatric neoplasia with a high incidence in non-developed countries. Nowadays the diagnosis is clinical and unfortunately in advanced stages of the diseases, which puts the childs life risk. The search for molecular diagnosis on retinoblastoma is necessary. Due to their location and tendency to migrate, biopsies of retinoblastoma are not recommended then, peripheral blood samples can be a good source for the search of biomarker. RT qPCR is a sensitive method for gene expression quantification; in order to achieve optimal results, a crucial step is the reference gene choice that cannot be neglected under any circumstance. Six of the most commonly used housekeeping genes; GAPDH, HPRT1, B2M, TBP, RPL13a and 18S, were tested in the blood samples of patients diagnosed with retinoblastoma and healthy controls. The HPRT and TBP were found the most reliable genes whereas GAPDH, that is one of the most commonly used genes for normalisation, together with B2M, RPL13a and 18S have to be avoided. Using the selected reference genes, the Rb mRNA showed significant differences between patients and healthy children whereas no differences were found using to control groups. In the present study, we validate blood samples of patients with retinoblastoma.",

We analyze available DNA datasets from both ancient and contemporary samples and identify a Caucasian signal, carried to Balkan populations by the nomadic dwellers of Early Medieval Saltovo-Mayaki Culture, located on the northern slope of Caucasus Mountains and adjacent steppe regions. We also identify two additional sources of Caucasian admixture in SEE populations, which are not specific to Bulgarian population only. Based on the results from our population genetic analysis we suggest that contemporary Bulgarians are an admixture of ancestral Slavonic groups, rich on locally absorbed EEF DNA and Proto Bulgarians, rich on Caucasian DNA and genetically related to the bearers of the Saltovo-Mayaki Culture from 8-10 century AD.",

One source of these changes has been hypothesized to be our self-domestication (that is, the development in humans of features commonly found in domesticated strains of mammals, seemingly as a result of selection for reduced aggression). Signals of domestication, notably brain size reduction, have increased in recent times. In this paper we compare whole-genome data between Late Neolithic/Bronze Age individuals and modern Europeans and show that genes associated with mammal domestication and with neural crest development and function are significantly differently enriched in nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms between these two groups. We hypothesize how these changes might account for the increased features of self-domestication in modern humans and ultimately, for subtle recent changes in human cognition and behavior, including language.",

Despite widespread use of veterinary B. bronchiseptica vaccines, there is limited information on their composition, relative efficacy, and the immune responses they elicit. Furthermore, human B. bronchiseptica vaccines are not available. We leveraged the dual antigenic and adjuvant functions of BcfA to develop acellular B. bronchiseptica vaccines in the absence of an additional adjuvant. Balb/c mice immunized with BcfA alone or a trivalent vaccine containing BcfA and the Bordetella antigens FHA and Prn were equally protected against challenge with a prototype B. bronchiseptica strain. The trivalent vaccine protected mice significantly better than the canine vaccine Bronchicine(R) and provided protection against a B. bronchiseptica strain isolated from a dog with kennel cough. Th1/17-polarized immune responses correlate with long-lasting protection against Bordetellae and other respiratory pathogens. Notably, BcfA strongly attenuated the Th2 responses elicited by FHA/Prn, resulting in Th1/17-skewed responses in inherently Th2-skewed Balb/c mice. Thus, BcfA functions as both an antigen and an adjuvant, providing protection as a single component vaccine. BcfA-adjuvanted vaccines may improve the efficacy and durability of vaccines against Bordetellae and other pathogens.",
