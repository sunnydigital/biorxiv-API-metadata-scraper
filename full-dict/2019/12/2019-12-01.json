    "abstract": "This work reports a dynamical Markov state model of CLC-2 \"fast\" (pore) gating, based on 600 microseconds of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. In the starting conformation of our CLC-2 model, both outer and inner channel gates are closed. The first conformational change in our dataset involves rotation of the inner-gate backbone along residues S168-G169-I170. This change is strikingly similar to that observed in the cryo-EM structure of the bovine CLC-K channel, though the volume of the intracellular (inner) region of the ion conduction pathway is further expanded in our model. From this state (inner gate open and outer gate closed), two additional states are observed, each involving a unique rotameric flip of the outer-gate residue GLUex. Both additional states involve conformational changes that orient GLUex away from the extracellular (outer) region of the ion conduction pathway. In the first additional state, the rotameric flip of GLUex results in an open, or near-open, channel pore. The equilibrium population of this state is low ([~]1%), consistent with the low open probability of CLC-2 observed experimentally in the absence of a membrane potential stimulus (0 mV). In the second additional state, GLUex rotates to occlude the channel pore. This state, which has a low equilibrium population ([~]1%), is only accessible when GLUex is protonated. Together, these pathways model the opening of both an inner and outer gate within the CLC-2 selectivity filter, as a function of GLUex protonation. Collectively, our findings are consistent with published experimental analyses of CLC-2 gating and provide a high-resolution structural model to guide future investigations.\n\nAuthor summaryIn the brain, the roles and mechanisms of sodium-, potassium-, and calcium-selective ion channels are well established. In contrast, chloride-selective channels have been studied much less and are not sufficiently understood, despite known associations of chloride-channel defects with brain disorders. The most broadly expressed voltage-activated chloride channel in the brain is CLC-2 (one of 9 human CLC homologs). In this work, we use simulations to model the conformational dynamics of the CLC-2 chloride ion channel selectivity filter (SF), which is the part of the protein that controls whether the channel is in an ion-conducting or non-conducting state. Our analysis identifies four primary conformational states and a specific progression through these states. Our results are consistent with structural and functional data in the literature and provide a high-resolution model for guiding further studies of CLC-2. These results will inform our understanding of how CLC-2 governs electrical activity and ion homeostasis in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Gastrulation is the first major morphogenetic event during animal embryogenesis. Ascidian gastrulation starts with the invagination of 10 endodermal precursor cells between the 64- and late 112-cell stages. This process occurs in the absence of endodermal cell division and in two steps, driven by myosin-dependent contractions of the acto-myosin network. First, endoderm precursors constrict their apex. Second, they shorten apico-basally, while retaining small apical surfaces, thereby causing invagination. The mechanisms controlling the endoderm mitotic delay, the step 1 to step 2 transition, and apico-basal shortening have remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate the conserved role during invagination of Nodal and Eph signalling in two distantly related ascidian species (Phallusia mammillata and Ciona intestinalis). We show that the transition to step 2 is controlled by Nodal relayed by Eph signalling and that Eph signalling has a Nodal-independent role in mitotic delay. Interestingly, both Nodal and Eph signals are dispensable for endodermal germ layer fate specification.\n\nSummary statementIdentification of a regulatory developmental signalling sub-network driving endoderm cell shape changes during ascidian endoderm invagination, not involved in cell fate specification.",

    "abstract": "Successful plant colonization by parasites requires the circumvention of host defenses, and sometimes a reprogramming of host metabolism, mediated by effector molecules delivered into the host. Using transcriptomic and enzymatic approaches, we characterized salivary glands and saliva of Phloeomyzus passerinii, an aphid exhibiting an atypical feeding strategy. Plant genes responses to salivary extracts of P. passerinii and Myzus persicae were assessed with poplar protoplasts of a susceptible and a resistant genotype, and in a heterologous Arabidopsis system. We predict that P. passerinii secretes a highly peculiar saliva containing effectors potentially interfering with host defenses, biotic stress signaling and plant metabolism, notably phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases which seemed specific to P. passerinii. Gene expression profiles indicated that salivary extracts of M. persicae markedly affected host defenses and biotic stress signaling, while salivary extracts of P. passerinii induced only weak responses. The effector-triggered susceptibility was characterized by downregulations of genes involved in cytokinin signaling and auxin homeostasis. This suggests that P. passerinii induces an intracellular accumulation of auxin in susceptible host genotypes, which is supported by histochemical assays in Arabidopsis. This might in turn affect biotic stress signaling and contribute to host tissue manipulation by the aphid.",

We herein report a smart methanol-responsive polymer (MeRPy) that can be programmed to bind and separate single- as well as double-stranded DNA targets. Captured targets are quickly isolated and released back into solution by denaturation (sequence-agnostic) or toehold-mediated strand displacement (sequence-selective). The latter mode allows 99.8% efficient removal of unwanted sequences and 79% recovery of highly pure target sequences. We applied MeRPy for the depletion of insulin, glucagon, and transthyretin cDNA from clinical next-generation sequencing (NGS) libraries. This step improved data quality for low-abundance transcripts in expression profiles of pancreatic tissues. Its low cost, scalability, high stability and ease of use make MeRPy suitable for diverse applications in research and clinical laboratories, including enhancement of NGS libraries, extraction of DNA from biological samples, preparative-scale DNA isolations, and sorting of DNA-labeled non-nucleic acid targets.",

We show that estimation of numerosity can be realized and learned by a single spiking neuron with an appropriate synaptic plasticity rule. This model can be efficiently trained to detect arbitrary spatio-temporal spike patterns on a noisy and dynamic background with high precision and low variance. When put to test in a task that requires counting of visual concepts in a static image it required considerably less training epochs than a convolutional neural network to achieve equal performance. When mimicking a behavioral task in free flying bees that requires numerical cognition the model reaches a similar success rate in making correct decisions. We propose that using action potentials to represent basic numerical concepts with a single spiking neuron is beneficial for organisms with small brains and limited neuronal resources.",

    "abstract": "Molecular ecology regularly requires the analysis of count data that reflect the relative abundance of features of a composition (e.g., taxa in a community, gene transcripts in a tissue). The sampling process that generates these data can be modeled using the multinomial distribution. Replicate multinomial samples inform the relative abundances of features in an underlying Dirichlet distribution. These distributions together form a hierarchical model for relative abundances among replicates and sampling groups. This type of Dirichlet-multinomial modelling (DMM) has been described previously, but its benefits and limitations are largely untested. With simulated data, we quantified the ability of DMM to detect differences in proportions between treatment and control groups, and compared the efficacy of three computational methods to implement DMM--Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), variational inference (VI), and Gibbs Markov chain Monte Carlo. We report that DMM was better able to detect shifts in relative abundances than analogous analytical tools, while identifying an acceptably low number of false positives. Among methods for implementing DMM, HMC provided the most accurate estimates of relative abundances, and VI was the most computationally efficient. The sensitivity of DMM was exemplified through analysis of previously published data describing lung microbiomes. We report that DMM identified several potentially pathogenic, bacterial taxa as more abundant in the lungs of children who aspirated foreign material during swallowing; these differences went undetected with different statistical approaches. Our results suggest that DMM has strong potential as a statistical method to guide inference in molecular ecology.",

We implemented a novel approach combining seed-to-whole-brain sliding-window functional connectivity MRI and k-means clustering to assess time-varying functional connectivity of aINS subregions. We studied three independent large samples of healthy participants and longitudinal datasets to assess inter- and intra-subject stability, and related aINS time-varying functional connectivity profiles to dispositional empathy. We identified four robust aINS time-varying functional connectivity modes that displayed both \"state\" and \"trait\" characteristics: while modes featuring connectivity to sensory regions were modulated by eye closure, modes featuring connectivity to higher cognitive and emotional processing regions were stable over time and related to empathy measures.",

    "abstract": "Residing in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas, beta cells contribute to glucose homeostasis by managing the bodys insulin supply. A circulating hypothesis has been that healthy beta cells heavily engage in cell-to-cell communication to perform their homeostatic function. We provide strong evidence in favor of this hypothesis in the form of (i) a dynamical network model that faithfully mimics fast calcium oscillations in response to above-threshold glucose stimulation and (ii) empirical data analysis that reveals a qualitative shift in the cross-correlation structure of measured signals below and above the threshold glucose concentration. Combined together, these results point to a glucose-induced transition in beta-cell activity thanks to increasing coordination through gap-junctional signaling and paracrine interactions. The model further suggests how the conservation of entire cell-cell conductance, observed in coupled but not uncoupled beta cells, emerges as a collective phenomenon. An overall implication is that improving the ability to monitor beta-cell signaling should offer means to better understand the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus.",

Codons most used in highly transcribed genes, often called optimal codons, typically have high gene counts of matching tRNA genes (tRNA abundance) and promote accurate and/or efficient translation. Non-optimal codons, those least used in highly expressed genes, may also affect translation. In multicellular organisms, codon optimality may vary among tissues. At present however, codon use remains poorly understood in multicellular organisms. Here, we studied codon usage of genes highly transcribed in germ line (testis, ovary) and somatic tissues (gonadectomized males and females) of the beetle Tribolium castaneum. The results demonstrate that: 1) the majority of optimal codons were organism-wide, the same in all tissues, and had numerous matching tRNA gene copies (Opt-codon{uparrow}tRNAs), consistent with translational selection; 2) some optimal codons varied among tissues, suggesting tissue-specific tRNA populations; 3) wobble tRNA were required for translation of certain optimal codons (Opt-codonwobble), possibly allowing precise translation and/or protein folding; and 4) remarkably, some non-optimal codons had abundant tRNA genes (Nonopt-codon{uparrow}tRNAs), and genes using those codons were tightly linked to ribosomal and stress-response functions. Thus, Nonopt-codon{uparrow}tRNAs codons may regulate translation of specific genes. Together, the evidence suggests that codon use and tRNA genes regulate multiple translational processes in T. castaneum.",

However, state-of-the-art retrieval systems only offer text-based searches for user-entered keywords. In this study, we present an interactive retrieval system with a context-dependent and protocol-element-selection function for successfully designing a clinical trial protocol. To do this, we first introduce a database for a protocol retrieval system constructed from individual protocol data extracted from 184,634 clinical trials and 13,210 frame structures of clinical trial protocols. The database contains various semantic information that enables the protocols to be filtered during the search operation. Based on the database, we developed a web application called the clinical trial protocol database system (CLIPS; available at https://corus.kaist.edu/clips), which enables an interactive search by utilizing protocol elements. CLIPS provides the options to select the next element according to the previous element in the form of a connected tree, thus enabling an interactive search for combinations of protocol elements. The validation results show that our method achieves better performance than existing databases in predicting phenotypic features.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe HERV-K (HML-2) viruses are the youngest of the human endogenous retroviruses. They are present as several almost complete proviral copies and numerous fragments in the human genome. Many HERV-K proviruses express a regulatory protein Rec, which binds to an element present in HERV-K mRNAs called the RcRE. This interaction is necessary for the nucleo-cytoplasmic export and expression of HERV-K mRNAs that retain introns and plays a role analogous to that of Rev and the RRE in HIV replication. There are over 900 HERV-K RcREs distributed throughout the human genome. Thus, it was of interest to determine if Rev could functionally interact with selected RcRE elements that map either to HERV-K proviruses or human gene regions. This interaction would have the potential to alter the expression of both HERV-K mRNAs and cellular mRNAs during HIV-1 infection.\n\nResultsIn this study we employed a combination of RNAseq, bioinformatics and cell-based functional assays. Potential RcREs were identified through a number of bioinformatic approaches. They were then tested for their ability to promote export and translation of a reporter mRNA with a retained intron in conjunction with Rev or Rec. Some of the selected elements functioned well with either Rev, Rec or both, whereas some showed little or no function. Rev function on individual RcREs varied and was also dependent on the Rev sequence. We also performed RNAseq on total and cytoplasmic RNA isolated from SupT1 cells expressing HIV Rev, with or without Tat, or HERV-K Rec. Proviral mRNA from three HERV-K loci (4p16.1b, 22q11.23 and most significantly 3q12.3) accumulated in the cytoplasm in the presence of Rev or Tat and Rev, but not Rec. Consistent with this, the 3 RcRE from 3q12.3 functioned well with HIV-Rev in our reporter assay. In contrast, this RcRE showed little or no function with Rec.\n\nConclusionsThe HIV Rev protein can functionally interact with many RcREs present in the human genome, depending on the RcRE sequence, as well as the Rev sequence. This leads to export of some of the HERV-K proviral mRNAs and also has the potential to change the expression of non-viral genes.",

    "abstract": "An important problem in computational neuroscience is to understand how networks of spiking neurons can carry out various computations underlying behavior. Balanced spiking networks (BSNs) provide a powerful framework for implementing arbitrary linear dynamical systems in networks of integrate-and-fire neurons (Boerlin et al. [1]). However, the classic BSN model requires near-instantaneous transmission of spikes between neurons, which is biologically implausible. Introducing realistic synaptic delays leads to an pathological regime known as \"ping-ponging\", in which different populations spike maximally in alternating time bins, causing network output to overshoot the target solution. Here we document this phenomenon and provide a novel solution: we show that a network can have realistic synaptic delays while maintaining accuracy and stability if neurons are endowed with conditionally Poisson firing. Formally, we propose two alternate formulations of Poisson balanced spiking networks: (1) a \"local\" framework, which replaces the hard integrate-and-fire spiking rule within each neuron by a \"soft\" threshold function, such that firing probability grows as a smooth nonlinear function of membrane potential; and (2) a \"population\" framework, which reformulates the BSN objective function in terms of expected spike counts over the entire population. We show that both approaches offer improved robustness, allowing for accurate implementation of network dynamics with realistic synaptic delays between neurons. Moreover, both models produce positive correlations between similarly tuned neurons, a feature of real neural populations that is not found in the original BSN. This work unifies balanced spiking networks with Poisson generalized linear models and suggests several promising avenues for future research.",

    "abstract": "For the first time, empirical evidence allowed to construct the frequency distribution of a genetic relatedness index between the parents of about half a million individuals living in the UK. The results suggest that over 30% of the population is the product of parents mating assortatively. The rest is probably the offspring of parents matching the genetic composition of their partners randomly. High degrees of genetic relatedness between parents, i.e. extreme inbreeding, was rare. This result shows that assortative mating is likely to be highly prevalent in human populations. Thus, assuming only random mating among humans, as widely done in ecology and population genetic studies, is not an appropriate approximation to reality. The existence of assortative mating has to be accounted for. The results suggest the conclusion that both, assortative and random mating, are evolutionary stable strategies. This improved insight allows to better understand complex evolutionary phenomena, such as the emergence and maintenance of sex, the speed of adaptation, runaway adaptation, maintenance of cooperation, and many others in human and animal populations.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVEA main challenge in the study of schizophrenia is its high heterogeneity. While it is generally accepted that there exist several biological mechanisms that may define distinct schizophrenia subtypes, they havent been identified yet. We applied comprehensive gene expression analysis, searching for molecular signals that differentiate patients with schizophrenia from healthy controls, and examined whether the identified signal characterizes a particular subgroup of the patients.\n\nMETHODSWe performed transcriptome sequencing of 14 superior temporal gyrus (STG) samples of relatively young (mean age: 44) subjects with schizophrenia and 15 matched controls from the Stanley Medical Research Institute. Analyses of differential expression and pathway enrichment were applied and the results were compared with those obtained from an independent cohort of elderly (mean age: 74) patients. Replicability was then tested on six additional independent datasets of various brain regions.\n\nRESULTSThe two STG cohorts of relatively young and elderly subjects showed high replicability. Pathway enrichment analysis of the down-regulated genes pointed to proteasome-related pathways. Meta-analysis of differential expression identified down-regulation of 12 of 39 proteasome subunits in schizophrenia. Down-regulation of multiple proteasome subunits was replicated in six additional datasets (overall 8 cohorts, with 267 schizophrenia and 266 control samples, from 5 brain regions, were studied). This signal was concentrated in a subgroup of the patients.\n\nCONCLUSIONSWe detect global down-regulation of proteasome subunits in a subgroup of the patients with schizophrenia. The proteasome is a major intracellular protein degradation system, where ubiquitinated proteins (proteins bound by the small protein called ubiquitin) are targeted for degradation. We hypothesize that the down-regulation we detect leads to proteasome dysfunction that causes accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins. Such accumulation has recently been identified, also in a subgroup of the studied patients with schizophrenia. Thus, down-regulation of proteasome subunits might define a biological subtype of schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Insects regulate their body temperature mostly behaviourally, by changing posture or microhabitat. These strategies may be ineffective in some habitats, for example on carrion. Carrion beetles create a feeding matrix by applying to cadaver surface anal or oral exudates. We tested the hypothesis that the matrix, which is formed on carrion by communally breeding beetle Necrodes littoralis L. (Silphidae), produces heat that enhances insect fitness. Using thermal imaging we demonstrate that heat produced in the matrix formed on meat by adult or larval beetles is larger than in meat decomposing without insects. Larval beetles regularly warmed up in the matrix. Moreover, by comparing matrix temperature and larval fitness in colonies with and without preparation of meat by adult beetles, we provide evidence that formation of a matrix by adult beetles has deferred thermal effects for larval microhabitat. We found an increase in heat production of the matrix and a decrease in development time and mortality of larvae after adult beetles applied their exudates on meat in the pre-larval phase. Our findings indicate that spreading of exudates over carrion by Necrodes larvae, apart from other likely functions (e.g. digesting carrion or promoting growth of beneficial microbes), facilitates thermoregulation. In case of adult beetles, this behaviour brings distinct thermal benefits for their offspring and therefore may be viewed as a new form of indirect parental care with an important thermal component.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTWhen a formerly rare pathogen emerges to cause a pandemic, it is critical to understand the ecology of the disease dynamics and its potential effects on disease control. Here, we take advantage of newly available experimental data to parameterize a temperature-dependent dynamical model of Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission, and analyze the effects of temperature variability and the parameters related to control strategies on ZIKV R0 and the final epidemic size (i.e., total number of human cases). Sensitivity analyses identified that R0 and the final epidemic size were largely driven by different parameters, with the exception of temperature, which is the dominant driver of epidemic dynamics in the models. Our estimate of R0 had a single optimum temperature (\u2248 30\u00b0 C), comparable to recently published results (\u2248 29\u00b0)1. However, the total number of human cases (\u201cfinal epidemic size\u201d) is maximized across a wider temperature range, from 24 to 36\u00b0C. The models indicate that the disease is highly sensitive to seasonal temperature variation. For example, although the model predicts that Zika transmission cannot occur at a constant temperature of 22\u00b0C, with seasonal variation of 5\u00b0C around a mean of 22\u00b0C, the model predicts a larger epidemic than what would occur at a constant 30\u00b0C, the temperature predicted to maximize R0. This suggests that the potential geographic range of Zika is wider than indicated from static R0 models, underscoring the importance of climate dynamics and variation on emerging infectious diseases.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

Here, we present a 3.3 [A] cryo-EM structure of yeast Maf1 bound to Pol III, which establishes how Maf1 achieves transcription repression. In the Maf1-bound state, Pol III elements that are involved in transcription initiation are sequestered, and the active site is sealed off due to ordering of the mobile C34 winged helix 2 domain. Specifically, the Maf1 binding site overlaps with the binding site of the Pol III transcription factor TFIIIB and DNA in the pre-initiation complex, rationalizing that binding of Maf1 and TFIIIB to Pol III are mutually exclusive. We validate our structure using variants of Maf1 with impaired transcription-inhibition activity. These results reveal the exact mechanism of Pol III inhibition by Maf1, and rationalize previous biochemical data.",

Identifying these mechanism-independent interactions could improve drug safety and support drug repurposing. We have developed \"iDTPnd\", a computational approach for large-scale discovery of novel targets for known drugs. For a given drug, we construct a positive and a negative structural signature that captures the weakly conserved structural features of drug binding sites. To facilitate assessment of unintended targets iDTPnd also provides a docking-based interaction score and its statistical significance. We were able to confirm the interaction of sorafenib, imatinib, dasatinib, sunitinib, and pazopanib with their known targets at a sensitivity and specificity of 52% and 55% respectively. We have validated 10 predicted novel targets, using in vitro experiments. Our results suggest that proteins other than kinases, such as nuclear receptors, cytochrome P450 or MHC Class I molecules can also be physiologically relevant targets of kinase inhibitors. Our method is general and broadly applicable for the identification of protein-small molecule interactions, when sufficient drug-target 3D data are available.",

    "abstract": "During demanding cognitive tasks, older adults (OAs) frequently show greater prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity than younger adults (YAs). This age-related PFC activity increase is often associated with enhanced cognitive performance, suggesting functional compensation. However, the brain is a complex network of interconnected regions, and it is unclear how network connectivity of PFC regions differs for OAs vs. YAs. To investigate this, we examined the age-related difference in functional brain network mediating episodic memory retrieval. YAs and OAs participants encoded and then recalled visual scenes, and age-related differences in network topology during memory retrieval were investigated as a function of memory performance. We measured both quantitative changes in functional integration and qualitative reconfiguration in connectivity patterns. The study yielded three main findings. First, PFC regions were more functionally integrated with the rest of the brain network in OAs. Critically, this age-related increase in PFC integration was associated with better retrieval performance. Second, PFC regions showed stronger performance-related reconfiguration of connectivity patterns in OAs. Finally, the magnitude of PFC reconfiguration increases in OAs tracked reconfiguration reductions in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) - a core episodic memory region, suggesting that PFC connectivity in OAs may be compensating for MTL deficits.",

In humans, emotional contagion has been shown to be stronger in women than men. Emotional contagion has been shown to exist also in rodents, and a growing number of studies explore the neural basis of emotional contagion in male rats and mice. These studies promise to shed light on the mechanisms that might go astray in psychiatric disorders characterized by dysfunctions of emotional contagion and empathy. Here we explore whether there are sex differences in emotional contagion in rats. We use an established paradigm in which a demonstrator rat receives footshocks while freezing is measured in both the demonstrator and an observer rat, which can hear, smell and see each other. By comparing pairs of male rats with pairs of female rats, we find (i) that female demonstrators freeze less when submitted to footshocks, but that (ii) the emotional contagion response, i.e. the degree of influence across the rats, does not depend on the sex of the rats. This was true whether emotional contagion was quantified based on the slope of a regression linking demonstrator and observer average freezing, or on Granger causality estimates of moment-to-moment freezing. The lack of sex differences in emotional contagion is compatible with an interpretation of emotional contagion as serving selfish danger detection.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic sex-ratio distorters based on X-chromosome shredding are predicted to be more efficient than sterile males for population suppression of malaria mosquitoes using genetic control. X-chromosome shredding operates through the targeted elimination of X-chromosome-bearing gametes during male spermatogenesis, resulting in males that have a high fraction of male offspring. Strains harboring autosomal constructs containing a modified endonuclease I-PpoI have now been developed in the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae, resulting in strong sex-ratio distortion towards males. Data are being gathered for these strains for submission of regulatory dossiers for contained use and subsequent field release in West Africa. Since autosomal X-shredders are transmitted in a Mendelian fashion and can be selected against their frequency in the population is expected to decline once releases are halted. However, any unintended transfer of the X-shredder to the Y-chromosome could theoretically change these dynamics: This could lead to 100% transmission of the newly Y-linked X-shredder to the predominant male-biased offspring and its insulation from negative selection in females, resulting in its potential spread in the population and ultimately to suppression. Here, we analyze plausible mechanisms whereby an autosomal X-shredder could become linked to the Y-chromosome after release and provide data regarding its potential for activity should it become linked to the Y-chromosome. Our results strongly suggest that Y-chromosome linkage through remobilization of the transposon used for the initial genetic transformation is unlikely, and that, in the unexpected event that the X-shredder becomes linked to the Y-chromosome, expression and activity of the X-shredder would likely be inhibited by meiotic sex chromosome inactivation. We conclude that a functioning X-shredding-based Y-drive resulting from a naturally induced transposition or translocation of the transgene onto the Y-chromosome is unlikely.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic sex-ratio distorters based on X-chromosome shredding are predicted to be more efficient than sterile males for population suppression of malaria mosquitoes using genetic control. X-chromosome shredding operates through the targeted elimination of X-chromosome-bearing gametes during male spermatogenesis, resulting in males that have a high fraction of male offspring. Strains harboring autosomal constructs containing a modified endonuclease I-PpoI have now been developed in the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae, resulting in strong sex-ratio distortion towards males. Data are being gathered for these strains for submission of regulatory dossiers for contained use and subsequent field release in West Africa. Since autosomal X-shredders are transmitted in a Mendelian fashion and can be selected against their frequency in the population is expected to decline once releases are halted. However, any unintended transfer of the X-shredder to the Y-chromosome could theoretically change these dynamics: This could lead to 100% transmission of the newly Y-linked X-shredder to the predominant male-biased offspring and its insulation from negative selection in females, resulting in its potential spread in the population and ultimately to suppression. Here, we analyze plausible mechanisms whereby an autosomal X-shredder could become linked to the Y-chromosome after release and provide data regarding its potential for activity should it become linked to the Y-chromosome. Our results strongly suggest that Y-chromosome linkage through remobilization of the transposon used for the initial genetic transformation is unlikely, and that, in the unexpected event that the X-shredder becomes linked to the Y-chromosome, expression and activity of the X-shredder would likely be inhibited by meiotic sex chromosome inactivation. We conclude that a functioning X-shredding-based Y-drive resulting from a naturally induced transposition or translocation of the transgene onto the Y-chromosome is unlikely.",

    "abstract": "In the studies of single-cell genomics, the large endeavor has been focused on the detection of the permanent changes in the genome. On the other hand, spontaneous DNA damage frequently occurs and results in transient single-stranded changes to the genome until they are repaired. So far, successful profiling of these dynamic changes has not been demonstrated by single-cell whole-genome amplification methods. Here we reported a novel single-cell WGA method: Linearly Produced Semiamplicon based Split Amplification Reaction (LPSSAR), which allows, for the first time, the genome-wide detection of the DNA damage associated single nucleotide variants (dSNVs) in single human cells. The sequence-based detection of dSNVs allows the direct characterization of the major damage signature that occurred in human cells. In the analysis of the abundance of dSNVs along the genome, we observed two modules of dSNV abundance, instead of a homogeneous abundance of dSNVs. Interestingly, we found that the two modules are associated with the A/B topological compartments of the genome. This result suggests that the genome topology directly influences genome stability. Furthermore, with the detection of a large number of dSNVs in single cells, we showed that only under a stringent filtering condition, can we distinguish the de novo mutations from the dSNVs and achieve a reliable estimation of the total level of de novo mutations in a single cell.",

    "abstract": "In most bacteria, cell division begins with the polymerization of the GTPase FtsZ at the mid-cell, which recruits the division machinery to initiate cell constriction. In the filamentous bacterium Streptomyces, cell division is positively controlled by SsgB, which recruits FtsZ to the future septum sites and promotes Z-ring formation. Here we show via site-saturated mutagenesis that various amino acid substitutions in the highly conserved SsgB protein result in the production of ectopically placed septa, that sever spores diagonally or along the long axis, perpendicular to the division plane. Ectopic septa were especially prominent when cells expressed SsgB variants with substitutions in residue E120. Biochemical analysis of SsgB variant E120G revealed that its interaction with - and polymerization of - FtsZ had been maintained. The crystal structure of S. coelicolor SsgB was resolved and the position of residue E120 suggests its requirement for maintaining the proper angle of helix 3, thus providing a likely explanation for the aberrant septa formed in SsgB E120 substitution mutants. Taken together, our work presents the first example of longitudinal division in a free living bacterium, which is explained entirely by changes in the FtsZ-recruiting protein SsgB.",

    "abstract": "Ribosome-associated factors play important roles in regulation of translation in response to various physiological and environmental signals. Here we present fluorescent polysome profiling, a new method that provides simultaneous detection of UV and fluorescence directly from polysome gradients. We demonstrate the capabilities of the method by following the polysome incorporation of different fluorescently tagged ribosomal proteins in human cells. Furthermore, we used fluorescent polysome profiling to examine chaperone-ribosome interactions, and characterized their changes in response to proteotoxic stress conditions. We revealed dynamic regulation of HSPA14-polysome association in response to heat shock, with a marked heat shock-mediated increase in the polysome-association of HSPA14. Our data suggest a model whereby HSPA14 dimerization is increased upon heat shock. We therefore established fluorescent polysome profiling as a streamlined method, that can enhance and facilitate the broad exploration of ribosome-associated factors and their regulation.",

To address his limitation we have developed a new drug target deconvolution approach based on limited proteolysis coupled with mass spectrometry that works across species including human cells (LiP-Quant). LiP-Quant features an automated data analysis pipeline and peptide-level resolution for the identification of any small-molecule binding sites, Here we demonstrate drug target identification by LiP-Quant across compound classes, including compounds targeting kinases and phosphatases. We demonstrate that LiP-Quant estimates the half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of compound binding sites in whole cell lysates. LiP-Quant identifies targets of both selective and promiscuous drugs and correctly discriminates drug binding to homologous proteins.

    "abstract": "To uncover genetic basis of autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (ARRP), we applied 2-step genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 640 Japanese patients prescreened with targeted re-sequencing. Meta-GWAS identified three independent peaks at P < 5.0x10-8, all within the major ARRP gene EYS. Two were each tagged by a low frequency variant (allele frequency < 0.05); a known founder Mendelian mutation (c.4957dupA, p.S1653Kfs*2) and a presumably hypomorphic non-synonymous variant (c.2528G>A, p.G843E). c.2528G>A newly solved 7.0% of Japanese ARRP cases, improving genetic diagnosis by 26.8% and simultaneously serving as a new attractive target for genome editing gene therapy. The third peak was tagged by an intronic common variant, representing a novel disease-susceptibility signal. GWAS successfully unraveled genetic causes of a rare \"monogenic\" disorder for the first time, which provided unexpected insights into significant contribution of non-Mendelian genetic factors and identified a novel high frequency variant directly linked to development of local genome therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) are two microbial processes competing for nitrate and organic carbon (COD). Their competition has great implications for nitrogen loss, conservation, and greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, a comprehensive and mechanistic understanding of the governing factors for this competition is still lacking. We applied the resource-ratio theory and verified it with competition experiments of denitrification and DNRA reported in the literature. Based on this theory, we revealed how COD/N ratio, influent resource concentrations, dilution rate, and stoichiometric and kinetic parameters individually and collectively define the boundaries for different competition outcomes in continuous cultures. The influent COD/N ratio alone did not drive competition outcome as the boundary COD/N ratio for different competition outcomes changed significantly with influent resource concentrations. The stoichiometry of the two processes was determinative for the boundaries, whereas the affinity for the resources (Ks), maximum specific growth rate (max) of the two species and the dilution rate had significant impacts as well but mainly at low influent resource concentrations (e.g., <100 M nitrate). The proposed approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the parameters controlling microbial selection and explains apparently conflicting experimental results. The results from this model also provide testable hypotheses and tools for understanding and managing the fate of nitrate in ecosystems and for other species that compete for two resources.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCytokines are a class of small proteins that act as chemical messengers and play a significant role in essential cellular processes including immunity regulation, hematopoiesis, and inflammation. As one important family of cytokines, tumor necrosis factors have association with the regulation of a various biological processes such as proliferation and differentiation of cells, apoptosis, lipid metabolism, and coagulation. The implication of these cytokines can also be seen in various diseases such as insulin resistance, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. Considering the interdependence between this kind of cytokine and others, classifying tumor necrosis factors from other cytokines is a challenge for biological scientists. In this research, we employed a word embedding technique to create hybrid features which was proved to efficiently identify tumor necrosis factors given cytokine sequences. We segmented each protein sequence into protein words and created corresponding word embedding for each word. Then, word embedding-based vector for each sequence was created and input into machine learning classification models. When extracting feature sets, we not only diversified segmentation sizes of protein sequence but also conducted different combinations among split grams to find the best features which generated the optimal prediction. Furthermore, our methodology follows Chous 5-step rules to build a reliable classification tool.\n\nResultsWith our proposed hybrid features, prediction models obtain more promising performance compared to seven prominent sequenced-based feature kinds. Results from 10 independent runs on the surveyed dataset show that on an average, our optimal models obtain an area under the curve of 0.984 and 0.998 on 5-fold cross-validation and independent test, respectively.\n\nConclusionsThese results show that biologists can use our model to identify tumor necrosis factors from other cytokines efficiently. Moreover, this study proves that natural language processing techniques can be applied reasonably to help biologists solve bioinformatics problems efficiently.",

    "abstract": "Contiguous genes in prokaryotes are often arranged into operons. Detecting operons plays a critical role in inferring gene functionality and regulatory networks. Human experts annotate operons by visually inspecting gene neighborhoods across pileups of related genomes. These visual representations capture the inter-genic distance, strand direction, gene size, functional relatedness, and gene neighborhood conservation, which are the most prominent operon features mentioned in the literature. By studying these features, an expert can then decide whether a genomic region is part of an operon. We propose a deep learning based method named Operon Hunter that uses visual representations of genomic fragments to make operon predictions. Using transfer learning and data augmentation techniques facilitates leveraging the powerful neural networks trained on image datasets by re-training them on a more limited dataset of extensively validated operons. Our method outperforms the previously reported state-of-the-art tools, especially when it comes to predicting full operons and their boundaries accurately. Furthermore, our approach makes it possible to visually identify the features influencing the networks decisions to be subsequently cross-checked by human experts.",
