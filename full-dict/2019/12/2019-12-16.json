    "abstract": "Internet-based scientific communities promise a means to apply distributed, diverse human intelligence towards previously intractable scientific problems. However, current implementations have not allowed communities to propose experiments to test all emerging hypotheses at scale or to modify hypotheses in response to experiments. We report high-throughput methods for molecular characterization of nucleic acids that enable the large-scale videogame-based crowdsourcing of functional RNA sensor design, followed by high-throughput functional characterization. Iterative design testing of thousands of crowdsourced RNA sensor designs produced near-thermodynamically optimal and reversible RNA switches that act as self-contained molecular sensors and couple five distinct small molecule inputs to three distinct protein binding and fluorogenic outputs--results that surpass computational and expert-based design. This work represents a new paradigm for widely distributed experimental bioscience.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryOnline community discovers standalone RNA sensors.",

    "abstract": "In mice, experimental influenza virus infection stimulates CD8 T cell infiltration of the airways. Virus is cleared by day 9, and between days 8 and 9 there is an abrupt change in CD8 T cell motility behavior transitioning from low velocity and high confinement on day 8, to high velocity with continued confinement on day 9. We hypothesized that it is loss of virus and/or antigen signals in the context of high chemokine levels that drives the T cells into a rapid surveillance mode. Virus infection induces chemokine production, which may change when the virus is cleared. We therefore sought to examine this period of rapid changes to the T cell environment in the tissue and seek evidence on the roles of peptide-MHC and chemokine receptor interactions. Experiments were performed to block G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling with Pertussis toxin (Ptx). Ptx treatment generally reduced cell velocities and mildly increased confinement, except on day 8 when velocity increased and confinement was relieved, suggesting chemokine mediated arrest. Blocking specific peptide-MHC with monoclonal antibody unexpectedly decreased velocities on days 7 through 9, suggesting TCR/peptide-MHC interactions promote cell mobility in the tissue. Together, these results suggest the T cells are engaged with antigen bearing and chemokine producing cells that affect motility in ways that vary with the day after infection. The increase in velocities on day 9 were reversed by addition of specific peptide, consistent with the idea that antigen signals become limiting on day 9 compared to earlier time points. Thus, antigen and chemokine signals act to alternately promote and restrict CD8 T cell motility until the point of virus clearance, suggesting the switch in motility behavior on day 9 may be due to a combination of limiting antigen in the presence of high chemokine signals as the virus is cleared.",

    "abstract": "Collagen is the most abundant protein in humans and is heavily post-translationally modified. Its biosynthesis is very complex and requires three different types of hydroxylation (two for proline and one for lysine) that are generated in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER). These processes involve many enzymes and chaperones which were collectively termed the molecular ensemble for collagen biosynthesis. However, the function of some of the proteins in this molecular ensemble is controversial. While prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 and 2 (P3H1, P3H2) are bona fide collagen prolyl 3-hydroxylases, the function of prolyl 3-hydroxylase 3 (P3H3) is less clear. A recent study of P3H3 null mice demonstrated that this enzyme had no activity as prolyl 3-hydroxylase but may instead act as a chaperone for lysyl hydroxylase 1 (LH1). LH1 is required to generate hydroxylysine for crosslinking within collagen triple helical sequences. If P3H3 is a LH1 chaperone that is critical for LH1 activity, P3H3 and LH1 null mice should have similar deficiency in lysyl hydroxylation. To test this hypothesis, we compared lysyl hydroxylation in type I and V collagen from P3H3 and LH1 null mice. Our results indicate LH1 plays a global role for lysyl hydroxylation in triple helical domain of type I collagen while P3H3 is indeed involved in lysyl hydroxylation particularly at crosslink formation sites but is not required for all lysyl hydroxylation sites in type I collagen triple helix. Furthermore, although type V collagen from LH1 null mice surprisingly contained as much hydroxylysine as type V collagen from wild type, the amount of hydroxylysine in type V collagen was clearly suppressed in P3H3 null mice. In summary, our study suggests that P3H3 and LH1 likely have two distinct mechanisms to distinguish crosslink formation sites from other sites in type I collagen and to recognize different collagen types in the rER.\n\nAuthor summaryCollagen is one of the most heavily post-translationally modified proteins in the human body and its post-translational modifications provide biological functions to collagen molecules. In collagen post-translational modifications, crosslink formation on a collagen triple helix adds important biomechanical properties to the collagen fibrils and is mediated by hydroxylation of very specific lysine residues. LH1 and P3H3 show the similar role in lysine hydroxylation for specific residues at crosslink formation sites of type I collagen. Conversely, they have very distinct rules in lysine hydroxylation at other residues in type I collagen triple helix. Furthermore, they demonstrate preferential recognition and modification of different collagen types. Our findings provide a better understanding of the individual functions of LH1 and P3H3 in the rER and also offer new directions for the mechanism of lysyl hydroxylation followed by crosslink formation in different tissues and collagens.",

    "abstract": "AimAbdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is a life-threatening weakening and expansion of the abdominal aorta due to inflammatory cell infiltration and gradual degeneration of extracellular matrix (ECM). There are no pharmacological therapies to treat AAA. We tested the hypothesis that nanoparticle (NP) therapy that targets degraded elastin and delivers anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and ECM stabilizing agent, pentagalloyl glucose (PGG) will reverse advance stage aneurysm in an elastase-induced mouse model of AAA.\n\nMethod and ResultsPorcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) was applied periadventitially to the infrarenal aorta in mice and AAA was allowed to develop for 14 days. Nanoparticles loaded with PGG (EL-PGG-NPs) were then delivered via IV route at 14-day and 21-day (10 mg/kg of body weight). A control group of mice received no therapy. The targeting of NPs to the AAA site was confirmed with fluorescent dye marked NPs and gold NPs. Animals were sacrificed at 28-d. We found that targeted PGG therapy reversed the AAA by decreasing matrix metalloproteinases MMP-9 and MMP-2, and the infiltration of macrophages in the medial layer. The increase in diameter of the aorta was reversed to healthy controls. Moreover, PGG treatment restored degraded elastic lamina and increased the circumferential strain of aneurysmal aorta to the healthy levels.\n\nConclusionOur results support that site-specific delivery of PGG with targeted nanoparticles can be used to treat already developed AAA. Such therapy can reverse inflammatory markers and restore arterial homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "West Nile virus (WNV) has consistently been reported to be associated with human cases of illness in the region near Chicago, Illinois. However, the number of reported cases of human illness varies across years, with intermittent outbreaks. Several dynamic factors, including temperature, rainfall, and infection status of vector mosquito populations, are responsible for much of these observed variations. However, local landscape structure and human demographic characteristics also play a key role. The geographic and temporal scales used to analyze such complex data affect the observed associations. Here, we used spatial and statistical modeling approaches to investigate the factors that drive the outcome of WNV human illness on fine temporal and spatial scales. Our approach included multi-level modeling of long-term weekly data from 2005 to 2016, with weekly measures of mosquito infection, human illness and weather combined with more stable landscape and demographic factors on the geographical scale of 1000m hexagons. We found that hot weather conditions, warm winters, and higher MIR in earlier weeks increased the probability of an area of having a WNV human case. Higher population and the proportion of urban light intensity in an area also increased the probability of observing a WNV human case. A higher proportion of open water sources, percentage of grass land, deciduous forests, and housing built post 1990 decreased the probability of having a WNV case. Additionally, we found that cumulative positive mosquito pools up to 31 weeks can strongly predict the total annual human WNV cases in the Chicago region. This study helped us to improve our understanding of the fine-scale drivers of spatiotemporal variability of human WNV cases.",

    "abstract": "Correct bioriented attachment of sister chromatids to mitotic spindle is essential for chromosome segregation. The conserved protein shugoshin (Sgo1) contributes in budding yeast to biorientation by recruiting the protein phosphatase PP2A-Rts1 and the condensin complex to centromeres. Using peptide prints, we identified a Serine-Rich Motif (SRM) of Sgo1 that mediates the interaction with condensin and is essential for centromeric condensin recruitment and the establishment of biorientation. We show that the interaction is regulated via phosphorylation within the SRM and we determined the phospho-sites using mass spectrometry. Analysis of the phosphomimicking and phosphoresistant mutants revealed that SRM phosphorylation disrupts the shugoshin - condensin interaction. We present an evidence that Mps1, a central kinase in the spindle assembly checkpoint, directly phosphorylates Sgo1 within the SRM to regulate the interaction with condensin and thereby condensin localization to centromeres. Our findings identify novel mechanisms that control shugoshin activity at the centromere in budding yeast.\n\nAuthor summaryProper chromosome segregation in eukaryotes is ensured through correct attachment of the spindle microtubules to the centromeric chromosomal regions. The attachment is mediated via the multimolecular proteinaceous complex called kinetochore and precisely regulated. This enables the establishment of so called bioirentation, when each sister chromatid is attached to microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles. Shugoshin (Sgo1) is a conserved centromeric protein that facilitates biorientation through its interactions with the protein phosphatase PP2A/Rts1, chromosome passanger complex and centromeric condensin. Here, we identified a serin-rich motif that is required for the interaction of shugoshin with the condensin complex. We show that loss of this region impairs condensin enrichment at the centromere, chromosome biorientation, segregation as well as the function of the chromosome passanger complex in the error correction. Moreover, the interaction is phosphoregulated, as phosphorylation of the serin-rich motif on Sgo1 disrupts its interaction with condensin. Finally, we show that the conserved spindle assembly checkpoint kinase Mps1 is responsible for this phosphorylation. Our findings uncover novel regulatory mechanisms that facilitate proper chromosome segregation.",

To understand ecological aspects of wolves in this landscape, we predict wolf distribution, diet patterns and conflict perception in Spiti, India using field and remotely sensed information. We collected scats (n = 283) of canid species namely, Wolves, and other predators over a period of 3 years (2014-17) [66]. Wolf diet constituted mostly of domestic prey (79.02 %) while wild prey constituted to 17.80% of wolf diet over the three years. Village surveys recorded only 4% of the respondents confirmed wolf presence and perceived them as a possible threat to various livestock. Over, 98% of the respondents claimed that wolves were not safe for livestock and were averse to its presence. Marginal response curves depicted the model to have positive responses to animal location, LULC, village population, village density and wolf depredation. We found perceived presence/threat distribution wolves in the area significantly differed from actual ecological presence and distribution of wolves. The Himalayan wolf is an apex flagship predator in this fragile high altitude system, whose role is intricately linked with the ecology of the region.

    "abstract": "BackgroundA novel tp0548 sequence-type was identified in one clinical isolate (X-4) from a patient diagnosed with primary syphilis in Xiamen, China. To precisely define and characterize this new clinical isolate, we performed further genome-scale molecular analysis.\n\nMethodology/Principal findingsThe alignment of all published tp0548 genotypes revealed that this new genotype had a unique nucleotide substitution G->T at position 167, and the letter \"ao\" was assigned to the genotype. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the \"ao\" genotype belonged to the SS14-like clade of Treponema pallidum (TPA) strains. The genome of the X-4 isolate was then sequenced and analyzed, and the result of a multi-locus sequence analysis using a set of nine chromosomal loci showed that the X-4 isolate was clustered with a monophyletic group of TPA strains, which clearly identified the isolate as a TPA strain. Whole-genome phylogenetic analysis was subsequently conducted to corroborate the TPA strain classification of the X-4 isolate. And the isolate was genetically related to the SS14 strain, with 42 single nucleotide variations and 12 insertions/deletions. In addition, high intrastrain heterogeneity in the length of the poly G/C tracts was found in the TPAChi_0347 locus, which indicated that this gene was most likely involved in phase variation events. The first investigation of the length heterogeneity of the poly A/T tracts showed the variability of the ploy A/T was lower, and all the observed intrastrain variations fell within coding regions.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceThe study demonstrated the X-4 isolate was a TPA isolate containing a novel tp0548 sequence-type. The identification of intrastrain genetic heterogeneity at poly G/C tracts and poly A/T tracts of the isolate could provide a snapshot of the genes that potentially involved in genotype-phenotype variations. These findings provide an unequivocal characterization for better understanding the molecular variation of this emerging isolate.\n\nAuthor summaryThree subspecies of Treponema pallidum (pallidum, pertenue, and endemicum) are increasingly showing overlap in terms of transmission and clinical manifestations. We recently identified a novel tp0548 genotype in the X-4 isolate, which was obtained from an adult male with genital lesions. The novel genotype contained a unique nucleotide substitution G->T at position 167 and belonged to the SS14-like clade of TPA strains, as determined by phylogenetic analysis. We conducted an in-depth exploration of the genome of the X-4 isolate using the pooled segment genome sequencing method followed by Illumina sequencing. Multi-locus sequence analysis of nine chromosomal loci demonstrated that the X-4 isolate was clustered within a monophyletic group of TPA strains, which identified the isolate as a TPA strain. Whole-genome phylogenetic analysis subsequently corroborated the TPA strain classification of the X-4 isolate and revealed that the isolate was very closely related to the SS14 strain, with 42 single nucleotide variations and 12 insertions/deletions. In addition, characterization of the intrastrain heterogeneity in the lengths of homopolymeric tracts in the X-4 isolate showed that the heterogeneity of the poly G/C tracts was greater than that of the poly A/T tracts, and high poly G/C tract diversity was observed in the TPAChi_0347 locus.",

    "abstract": "Myocyte enhancer factor 2 C (MEF2C) is an important transcription factor during neurodevelopment. Mutation or deletion of MEF2C causes intellectual disability (ID) and common variants within MEF2C are associated with cognitive function and schizophrenia risk. We investigated if genes influenced by MEF2C during neurodevelopment are enriched for genes associated with neurodevelopmental phenotypes, and if this can be leveraged to identify biological mechanisms and individual brain cell types affected. We used a set of 1,052 genes that were differentially expressed in the adult mouse brain following early embryonic deletion of Mef2c in excitatory cortical neurons. Using GWAS data, we found these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to be enriched for genes associated with schizophrenia, intelligence and educational attainment but not autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Using sequencing data from trios studies, we found these DEGs to be enriched for genes containing de novo mutations reported in ASD and ID, but not schizophrenia. Using single cell RNA-seq data, we identified that a number of different excitatory glutamatergic neurons in the cortex were enriched for these DEGs including deep layer pyramidal cells and cells in the retrosplenial cortex, entorhinal cortex and subiculum. These data indicate that genes influenced by MEF2C during neurodevelopment contribute to cognitive function and risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. Within excitatory neurons, common SNPs in these genes contribute to cognition and SZ risk via an effect on synaptic function based on gene ontology analysis. In contrast, rare mutations contribute to earlier onset ASD and ID via an effect on cell morphogenesis.\n\nAuthor SummarySchizophrenia is a complex disorder caused by many genes. Current drugs for schizophrenia are only partially effective and do not treat cognitive deficits, which are key factors for explaining disability. Here we take an individual gene identified in genetic studies of schizophrenia and cognition called MEF2C, which on its own is a very important regulator of brain development. We use data from a mouse study where MEF2C has been stopped from functioning or knocked out during brain development. The effect of that knock out has been measured when the mice reach adulthood, in the form of a set of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the somatosensory cortex. We found that this set of DEGs contains more genes than expected by chance that are associated with schizophrenia and cognition or contain rare new (de novo) mutations reported in autism and intellectual disability. Using gene expression data from single brain cells, we identified that a number of specific excitatory glutamatergic neurons in the cortex were enriched for these DEGs. This study provides evidence that the molecular mechanisms that underpin schizophrenia and cognitive function include disruption of cell types influenced by MEF2C.",

    "abstract": "Passage of Plasmodium through a mosquito midgut is essential for malaria transmission. FREP1, a peritrophic matrix protein in a mosquito midgut, binds to the parasite and mediates Plasmodium infection in Anopheles. The FREP1-mediated Plasmodium invasion pathway is highly conserved across multiple species of Plasmodium and Anopheles. Through pulldown, nine P. berghei proteins were co-precipitated with FREP1-conjugated beads. After cloning these nine genes from P. berghei and expressing them in insect cells, six of them were confirmed to interact with recombinant FREP1 protein. Among them, -tubulin-1 and heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) were highly conserved in Plasmodium species with >95% identity. Thus, P. falciparum -tubulin-1 and Hsp70 were cloned and expressed in E. coli to stimulate antibody (Ab) in mice. Our results showed that anti-serum against P. falciparum -tubulin-1 significantly inhibited P. falciparum transmission to An. gambiae, while Ab against P. falciparum Hsp70 serum did not. The polyclonal Ab against human -tubulin did not interfere formation of ookinetes, however, significantly reduced the number of P. falciparum oocysts in An. gambiae midguts. Moreover, fluorescence microscope assays showed that anti--tubulin Ab bound to impermeable Plasmodium ookinete apical invasive apparatus. Therefore, we propose that the interaction between Anopheles FREP1 protein and Plasmodium -tubulin-1 directs the ookinete invasive apparatus towards midgut peritrophic matrix for the efficient passage of the parasite. Anopheles FREP1 and Plasmodium -tubulin-1 are potential targets for blocking malaria transmission to the mosquito host.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe molecular mechanisms of malaria transmission to mosquito are not well-understood. FREP1 proteins in mosquito midget PM has been proved to mediate malaria transmission by binding to parasite ookinetes. Here we reported that Plasmodium parasite -tubulin-1 is an FREP1 binding partner. We initially identified the -tubulin-1 through the FREP1-pulldown assay; Then we cloned P. falciparum -tubulin-1, and demonstrated that the insect cell expressed recombinant Plasmodium -tubulin-1 bound to FREP1 in vitro; Next, mouse anti-serum against P. falciparum -tubulin-1 was found to inhibit P. falciparum transmission to An. gambiae. P. falciparum -tubulin-1 shares >84% identical amino acid sequence with human -tubulin, purified Ab against human -tubulin significantly inhibited malaria transmission. Anti-human -tubulin Ab did not interfere the gametocyte-to-ookinetes conversion. Final, we found that anti--tubulin Ab bound to the apical end of impermeable ookinetes. Structurally, ookinete invasive apparatus locates at the apical opening. Therefore, we propose that the interaction between Anopheles midgut FREP1 protein and Plasmodium apical -tubulin-1 directs the ookinete invasive apparatus towards midgut PM for the efficient parasite invasion.",

    "abstract": "The development of deep convolutional networks (DCNs) has recently led to great successes in computer vision and have become de facto computational models of vision. However, a growing body of work suggests that they exhibit critical limitations beyond image categorization. Here, we study a fundamental limitation of DCNs for judging whether two items are the same or different (SD) compared to a baseline assessment of their spatial relationship (SR). We test the prediction that SD tasks recruit additional cortical mechanisms which underlie critical aspects of visual cognition that are not explained by current computational models. We thus recorded EEG signals from 14 participants engaged in the same tasks as the computational models. Importantly, the two tasks were matched in terms of difficulty by an adaptive psychometric procedure: yet, on top of a modulation of evoked potentials, our results revealed higher activity in the low beta (13-20Hz) band in the SD compared to the SR conditions, which we surmise as reflecting the crucial involvement of recurrent mechanisms sustaining working memory and attention.\n\nAuthor SummaryDespite the impressive progress of deep convolutional networks (DCNs) in object recognition, recent studies demonstrated that state-of-the-art vision algorithms encounter severe limitations when performing certain visual reasoning tasks: for instance, convolutional networks can easily solve problems involving spatial relations, but fail in identifying whether two items are identical or different (same-different task). This conclusion led us to test the hypothesis that different computational mechanisms are needed to successfully perform these tasks also in the visual system. First, we confirmed in our simulations that DCNs can successfully perform spatial relationship tasks but struggle with same-different ones. Then, we tested 14 participants on the same experimental design while recording their EEG signals. Remarkably, our results revealed a significant difference between the tasks in the occipital brain regions both in evoked potentials and in the oscillatory dynamics. Specifically, an increase of activity was found when performing the SD over the SR condition. We interpret these results as reflecting the fundamental involvement of recurrent mechanisms implementing cognitive functions such as working memory and attention.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine which physiological variables could predict performance during a CrossFit competition. Fifteen male CrossFit athletes (35 {+/-} 9 years) participated and performed a series of tests (incremental load test for full squat and bench press, jump tests, incremental running test, and Wingate test) that were used as potential predictors of CrossFit performance. Thereafter, they performed the five Workouts of the Day (WODs) corresponding to the CrossFit Games Open 2019, and the relationship between each variable and CrossFit performance was analyzed. Overall Crossfit performance (i.e., final ranking considering all WODs) was significantly related to jump ability, mean and peak power output during the Wingate test, relative maximum strength for the full squat and the bench press, and maximum oxygen uptake and maximum speed during an incremental running test (all p<0.05, r=0.58-0.75), although the relationship of most markers varied depending on the analyzed WOD. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the combination of maximum oxygen uptake, squat jump ability, and reactive strength index accounted for 81% of the variance in overall CrossFit performance (p=0.0003). CrossFit performance seems dependent on a variety of power-, strength-, and aerobic-related markers, which reflects the complexity of this sport. Improvements in aerobic capacity may help people and athletes in CrossFit performance and well-being. Also, focus on lower body power could be the key to obtain better performance markers.",

    "abstract": "Cold stenothermal insects living in glacier-fed streams are stressed by temperature variations resulting from glacial retreat during global warming. The molecular aspects of insect response to environmental stresses remain largely unexplored. The aim of this study was to expand our knowledge of how a cold stenothermal organism controls gene expression at the transcriptional, translational, and protein level under warming conditions. Using the chironomid Diamesa tonsa as target species and a combination of RACE, qPCR, polysomal profiling, western blotting, and bioinformatics techniques, we discovered a new molecular pathway leading to previously overlooked adaptive strategies to stress. We obtained and characterized the complete cDNA sequences of three heat shock inducible 70 (hsp70) and two members of heat-shock cognate 70 (hsc70). Strikingly, we showed that a novel pseudo-hsp70 gene encoding a putative long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) which is transcribed during thermal stress, acting as a ribosome sponge to provide post-transcriptional control of HSP70 protein levels. The expression of the pseudo-hsp70 gene and its function suggest the existence of a new and unexpected mechanism to cope with thermal stress: lowering the pace of protein production to save energy and optimize resources for recovery.",

However, few studies have investigated the effects of aging on both locomotor activity and foraging ability. In the present study, we tested the aging effect on locomotor activity and foraging ability in the assassin bug Amphibolus venator. The present results showed that locomotor activity decreased with age, similar to findings in many other animal species. However, foraging ability increased with age. Namely, the decline in locomotor activity with age did not lead to a decline in foraging ability. The positive relationship between foraging ability and age may be related to the type of predation, sit-and-wait, used by A. venator via alterations in investment in reproductive traits with age.",

    "abstract": "Structure-from-Motion Multi View Stereo (SfM-MVS) photogrammetry is a technique by which volumetric data can be derived from overlapping image sets, using changes of an objects position between images to determine its height and spatial structure. Whilst SfM-MVS has fast become a powerful tool for scientific research, its potential lies beyond the scientific setting, since it can aid in delivering information about habitat structure, biomass, landscape topography, spatial distribution of species in both two and three dimensions, and aid in mapping change over time - both actual and predicted. All of which are of strong relevance for the conservation community, whether from a practical management perspective or understanding and presenting data in new and novel ways from a policy perspective.\n\nFor practitioners outside of academia wanting to use SfM-MVS there are technical barriers to its application. For example, there are many SfM-MVS software options, but knowing which to choose, or how to get the best results from the software can be difficult for the uninitiated. There are also free and open source software options (FOSS) for processing data through a SfM-MVS pipeline that could benefit those in conservation management and policy, especially in instances where there is limited funding (i.e. commonly within grassroots or community-based projects). This paper signposts the way for the conservation community to understand the choices and options for SfM-MVS implementation, its limitations, current best practice guidelines and introduces applicable FOSS options such as OpenDroneMap, MicMac, CloudCompare, QGIS and speciesgeocodeR. It will also highlight why and where this technology has the potential to become an asset for spatial, temporal and volumetric studies of landscape and conservation ecology.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the differences in the shell, radula and genital structures of 3 new invasive species, Achatina fulica Bowdich, 1822,Achatina albopicta E.A. Smith (1878) and Achatina reticulata Pfeiffer, 1845 collected from southwestern Nigeria and to determine features that would be of importance in the identification of these invasive species in Nigeria. This is the first report of Achatina albopicta and A. reticulata in Nigeria, but Achatina fulica have since been reported in Nigeria and other African countries outside coastal East Africa. No study has described the external or internal morphology of any of the invasive species in Nigeria. Five to ten live specimens of each species, with complete shell characters, of each species were used for this study. Vernier caliper was used to obtain all shell measurements, with the shell held vertically and the aperture facing the observer. The genital structures were dissected out and fixed in 70% alcohol for 10-15 minutes and examined. The buccal mass was dissected out and digested in 7.5% sodium hydroxide for 24 hrs to free the radula from snail tissues and then examined under the compound microscope.\n\nThe shells of the 3 new species were dextral, conical with pointed spire and narrow apex. The whorls were separated by deep sutures. The parietal walls and the columella of the three species were white but columella of A. reticulata had a characteristic thick deposit of white porcelain-like material. There were dark brown markings on the whorls of the three species on dirty brown background for A. fulica and A. reticulata and dirty yellowish background for A. albopicta. The shell of A. albopicta was slightly glossy on the body whorl. The whorls of A. albopicta were much more convex than the whorls of A. fulica and A. reticulata. The columella of A. albopicta was truncate above the base of the peristome, moderately concave and slightly curved up at the base, while the columella of A. fulica was truncate sharply at the base of the peristome and straight and the columella of A. reticulata was slantly truncate at the base of the peristome and straight. The genitalia of the three species were very identical but differed slightly in the emergence of the basal vas deferens from the penis. The penes were slender and completely enclosed by the penial sheaths. The length of the penis varied from 10 to 12 mm. The vas deferens, free oviduct and the spermatheca duct were very long. The radula could be differentiated by the structure of central teeth and the first lateral tooth. The study showed that the shell morphology, radula and genital structures can be of importance in the identification of members of the family Achatinidae in Nigeria.",

    "abstract": "Island species and habitats are particularly vulnerable to human disturbances, and anthropogenic changes are increasingly overwriting natural island biogeographic patterns. However, quantitative comparisons of how native and alien assemblages respond to human disturbances are scarce. Using data from 6,242 species of vertebrates, invertebrates and plants, from 7,718 sites on 81 islands, we model how land-use change, human population density and distance to the nearest road affect local assemblages of alien and native species on islands. We found that land-use change reduces both richness and abundance of native species, whereas the number and abundance of alien species are high in plantation forests and agricultural or urban sites. In contrast to the long-established pattern for native species (i.e., decline in species number with island isolation), more isolated islands have more alien species across most land uses than do less isolated islands. We show that alien species play a major role in the turnover of island assemblages: our models show that aliens outnumber natives among the species present at disturbed sites but absent from minimally-disturbed primary vegetation. Finally, we found a homogenization pattern for both native and alien assemblages across sites within most land uses. The declines of native species on islands in the face of human pressures, and the particular proneness to invasions of the more remote islands, highlight the need to reduce the intensity of human pressures on islands and to prevent the introduction and establishment of alien species.",

In this study, the research carried on the bark medium, nearly like the natural environment, which had special meaning because of its benefits for the widely application. As a result, it showed a significant effect especially in the later period of the cultivation, suggesting that mycorrhizal fungus MF23 had a promotion for D. nobile in the natural environment, which enabled the application of the technique in the experimental field.

    "abstract": "Illegal activities are a persistent problem in many protected areas, but an overview of the extent of this problem and its impact is lacking. We review 35 years (1980-1914) of research across the globe to examine the spatial distribution of research and socio-ecological factors influencing population decline within protected areas under illegal activities pressure. From 92 papers reporting 1048 species/site combinations, more than 350 species comprising mammals, reptiles, birds, fishes and molluscs were reported to have been extracted illegally from 146 protected areas across four continents. Research in illegal activities has increased substantially during the review period but also shows strong taxonomic and geographic biases towards large wild mammals and African continent respectively, suggesting persistent poaching pressures on wild mammals in African protected areas. Population declines were most frequent i) where there was commercial poaching as opposed to subsistence poaching alone, ii) in countries with a low human development index particularly in strict protected areas and iii) for species with a body mass over 100 kg. Habitat loss associated with greater land use change had an additional significant impact on population decline, particularly in the less-strict categories (IUCN III-VI) of protected area across the continents. Overall, these findings provide evidence that illegal activities are most likely to cause species declines of large-bodied animals in protected areas in resource-poor countries regardless of protected area conservation status (i.e. IUCN category). Given the mounting pressures of illegal activities, additional conservation effort such as improving anti-poaching strategies and conservation resources in terms of improving funding and personnel directed at this problem is a growing priority.",
