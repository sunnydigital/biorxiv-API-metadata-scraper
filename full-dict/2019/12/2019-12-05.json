    "abstract": "Coordinated assembly and disassembly of integrin-mediated focal adhesions (FAs) is essential for cell migration. Many studies have shown that FA disassembly requires Ca2+ influx, however our understanding of this process remains incomplete. Here we show that Ca2+ influx via STIM1/Orai1 calcium channels, which cluster near FAs, leads to activation of the GTPase Arf5 via the Ca2+-activated GEF IQSec1, and that both IQSec1 and Arf5 activation are essential for adhesion disassembly. We further show that IQSec1 forms a complex with the lipid transfer protein ORP3, and that Ca2+ influx triggers PKC-dependent translocation of this complex to ER/plasma membrane contact sites adjacent to FAs. In addition to allosterically activating IQSec1, ORP3 also extracts PI4P from the PM, in exchange for phosphatidylcholine. ORP3-mediated lipid exchange is also important for FA turnover. Together, these findings identify a new pathway that links calcium influx to FA turnover during cell migration.",

    "abstract": "An imbalance of normal bacterial groups such as Bacteroidales within the human gut is correlated with diseases like obesity. A current grand challenge in the microbiome field is to identify factors produced by normal microbiome bacteria that cause these observed health and disease correlations. While identifying factors like a bacterial injection system could provide a missing explanation for why Bacteroidales correlates with host health, no such factor has been identified to date. The lack of knowledge about these factors is a significant barrier to improving therapies like fecal transplants that promote a healthy microbiome. Here we show that a previously ill-defined Contractile Injection System is carried in the gut microbiome of 99% of individuals from the United States and Europe. This type of Contractile Injection System, we name here Bacteroidales Injection System (BIS), is related to the contractile tails of bacteriophage (viruses of bacteria) and have been described to mediate interactions between bacteria and diverse eukaryotes like amoeba, insects and tubeworms. Our findings that BIS are ubiquitous within adult human microbiomes suggest that they shape host health by mediating interactions between Bacteroidales bacteria and the human host or its microbiome.",

    "abstract": "Centrosomes must resist microtubule-mediated forces for mitotic chromosome segregation. During mitotic exit, however, centrosomes are deformed and fractured by those same forces, which is a key step in centrosome disassembly. How the functional material properties of centrosomes change throughout the cell cycle, and how they are molecularly tuned remain unknown. Here, we used optically-induced flow perturbations to determine the molecular basis of centrosome strength and ductility in C. elegans embryos. We found that both properties declined sharply at anaphase onset, long before natural disassembly. This mechanical transition required PP2A phosphatase and correlated with inactivation of PLK-1 (Polo Kinase) and SPD-2 (Cep192). In vitro, PLK-1 and SPD-2 directly protected centrosome scaffolds from force-induced disassembly. Our results suggest that, prior to anaphase, PLK-1 and SPD-2 confer strength and ductility to the centrosome scaffold so that it can resist microtubule-pulling forces. In anaphase, centrosomes lose PLK-1 and SPD-2 and transition to a weak, brittle state that enables force-mediated centrosome disassembly.",

    "abstract": "Diversification of neuronal subtypes often requires stochastic gene regulatory mechanisms. How stochastically expressed transcription factors interact with other regulators in gene networks to specify cell fates is poorly understood. The random mosaic of color-detecting R7 photoreceptor subtypes in Drosophila is controlled by the stochastic on/off expression of the transcription factor Spineless (Ss). In SsON R7s, Ss induces expression of Rhodopsin 4 (Rh4), whereas in SsOFF R7s, the absence of Ss allows expression of Rhodopsin 3 (Rh3). Here, we find that the transcription factor Runt, which is initially expressed in all R7s, activates expression of Spineless in a random subset of R7s. Later, as R7s develop, Ss negatively feeds back onto Runt to prevent repression of Rh4 and ensure proper fate specification. Together, stereotyped and stochastic regulatory inputs are integrated into feedforward and feedback mechanisms to control cell fate.",

    "abstract": "Herbivores must overcome a variety of plant defenses, including coping with plant secondary compounds (PSCs). To help detoxify these defensive chemicals, several insect herbivores are known to harbor gut microbiota with the metabolic capacity to degrade PSCs. Leaf-cutter ants are generalist herbivores, obtaining sustenance from specialized fungus gardens that act as external digestive systems, degrading the diverse collection of plants foraged by the ants. There is in vitro evidence that certain PSCs harm Leucoagaricus gongylophorus, the fungal cultivar of leaf-cutter ants, suggesting a role for the Proteobacteria-dominant bacterial community present within fungus gardens. Here, we investigate the ability of symbiotic bacteria present within fungus gardens of leaf-cutter ants to degrade PSCs. We cultured fungus garden bacteria, sequenced the genomes of 42 isolates, and identified genes involved in PSC degradation, including genes encoding cytochrome p450s and genes in geraniol, cumate, cinnamate, and -pinene/limonene degradation pathways. Using metatranscriptomic analysis, we show that some of these degradation genes are expressed in situ. Most of the bacterial isolates grew unhindered in the presence of PSCs and, using GC-MS, we determined that isolates from the genera Bacillus, Burkholderia, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, and Pseudomonas degrade -pinene, {beta}-caryophyllene, or linalool. Using a headspace sampler, we show that sub-colonies of fungus gardens reduced -pinene and linalool over a 36-hour period, while L. gongylophorus strains alone only reduced linalool. Overall, our results reveal that the bacterial community in fungus gardens play a pivotal role in alleviating the effect of PSCs on the leaf-cutter ant system.\n\nImportanceLeaf-cutter ants are dominant neotropical herbivores capable of deriving energy from a wide range of plant substrates. The success of leaf-cutter ants is largely due to their external gut composed of key microbial symbionts, specifically, the fungal mutualist L. gongylophorus and a consistent bacterial community. Both symbionts are known to have critical roles in extracting energy from plant material, yet comparatively little is known about their role in the detoxification of plant secondary compounds. Here, we assess if the bacterial community associated with leaf-cutter ant fungus gardens can degrade harmful plant chemicals. We identify plant secondary compound detoxification in leaf-cutter ant gardens as a process that depends on the degradative potential of both the bacterial community and L. gongylophorus. Our findings suggest the fungus garden and its associated microbial community influences the generalist foraging abilities of the ants, underscoring the importance of microbial symbionts in plant substrate suitability for herbivores.",

    "abstract": "Our visual system readily groups dynamic fragmented input into global objects. How the brain represents such perceptual grouping remains however unclear. To address this question, we recorded brain responses using functional magnetic resonance imaging whilst observers perceived a dynamic bistable stimulus that could either be perceived globally (i.e., as a grouped and coherently moving shape) or locally (i.e., as ungrouped and incoherently moving elements). We further estimated population receptive fields and used these to back-project the brain activity during stimulus perception into visual space via a searchlight procedure. Global perception resulted in non-topographic suppression of responses in lower visual cortex accompanied by wide-spread enhancement in higher object-sensitive cortex. However, follow-up experiments indicated that higher object-sensitive cortex is suppressed if global perception lacks shape grouping, and that grouping-related suppression can be diffusely confined to stimulated sites once stimulus size is reduced. These results speak against a rigid between-area response amplitude code acting as a generic grouping mechanism and point to a within-area response amplitude code mediating the perception of figure and ground.",

    "abstract": "The colonization of solid surfaces by bacteria is a widespread phenomenon with major consequences on environmental processes, biotechnology and human health. While much is known about the molecular mechanisms of surface colonization, the influence of the physical environment remains poorly understood. Here we show that the magnitude and location of colonization of non-planar surfaces by motile bacteria is largely controlled by the local flow conditions. Using microfluidic experiments with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, we demonstrate that the velocity gradients created by a curved surface drive preferential attachment to specific regions of the collecting surface, namely the leeward side of cylinders and immediately downstream of apexes on corrugated surfaces, locations that are in stark contrast to where non-motile cells attach. The preferential attachment location depends on the local hydrodynamic conditions and, as revealed by a mathematical model benchmarked on the observations, on cell morphology and swimming traits, while it is independent of the physicochemical properties of the surface. The interplay between imposed flow and bacterial motility further affects the overall attachment rate, increasing it by up to two orders of magnitude compared to the non-motile case at moderate flow velocities of up to twenty times the bacterial swimming speed. These results highlight the importance of fluid flow on the magnitude and location of bacterial colonization of surfaces and provide a mechanistic model to predict colonization in flow for a wide range of applications, from infection biology to bioremediation and biofouling.",

    "abstract": "Binge eating (BE) is a heritable symptom of eating disorders with an unknown genetic etiology. Rodent models for BE of palatable food permit the study of genetic and biological mechanisms. We previously used genetic mapping and transcriptome analysis to map a coding mutation in Cyfip2 associated with increased BE in the BE-prone C57BL/6NJ substrain compared to the BE-resistant C57BL/6J substrain. The increase in BE in C57BL/6NJ mice was associated with a decrease in transcription of genes enriched for myelination in the striatum. Here, we tested the hypothesis that decreasing myelin levels with the demyelinating agent cuprizone would enhance BE. Mice were treated with a 0.3% cuprizone home cage diet for two weeks. Following a three-week recovery period, mice were trained for BE in an intermittent, limited access procedure. Cuprizone induced similar weight loss in both substrains and sexes that recovered within 48 h after removal of the cuprizone diet. Surprisingly, cuprizone reduced BE in male but not female C57BL/6NJ mice while having no effect in C57BL/6J mice. Cuprizone also reduced myelin basic protein (MBP) at seven weeks post-cuprizone removal while having no effect on myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) at this time point. C57BL/6N mice also showed less MBP than C57BL/6J mice. There were no statistical interactions of Treatment with Sex on MBP levels, indicating that differences in MBP are unlikely to account for sex differences in BE. To summarize, cuprizone induced an unexpected, male-specific reduction in BE which could indicate sex-specific biological mechanisms that depend on genetic background.",

Behavioural syndromes are often displayed by invasive species but the role of activity rhythms in biological invasions is unknown. Here, we investigated whether early nocturnal activity (the relative amount of locomotor activity displayed early in the night) and risk-taking behaviour (i.e. response to a scare stimulus) form a behavioural syndrome in a major invasive species, the signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus). We first characterized daily rhythms of locomotor activity over five days under controlled laboratory conditions and then scored the response to a scare stimulus across two different contexts (neutral and food) two days apart within the following six days. Crayfish displayed overall daily activity rhythms peaking in the first four hours of darkness. Both early nocturnal activity and risk-taking behaviour showed consistent inter-individual differences with repeatability scores of 0.20 and 0.35, respectively. However, the two behavioural traits were not correlated as in a behavioural syndrome. We argue that in contrast to other behavioural syndromes, a link between early nocturnal activity and risk-taking tendency would not be evolutionary stable as it dramatically increases predictability and therefore predatory pressure to individuals. We suggest that daily activity rhythms and risk-taking behavior can be important traits in understanding the adaptations underlying biological invasions or other processes of contemporary evolution.",

    "abstract": "Current methods for monitoring marine fish diversity mostly rely on trawling surveys, which are invasive, costly and time-consuming. Moreover, these methods are selective, targeting a subset of species at the time, and can be inaccessible to certain areas. Here, we explore the potential of environmental DNA (eDNA), the DNA present in the water column as part of shed cells, tissues or mucus, to provide comprehensive information about fish diversity in a large marine area. Further, eDNA results were compared to the fish diversity obtained in pelagic trawls. A total of 44 5L-water samples were collected onboard a wide-scale oceanographic survey covering about 120,000 square kilometres in Northeast Atlantic Ocean. A short region of the 12S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced through metabarcoding generating almost 3.5 million quality-filtered reads. Trawl and eDNA samples resulted in the same most abundant species (European anchovy, European pilchard, Atlantic mackerel and blue whiting), but eDNA metabarcoding resulted in more detected fish and elasmobranch species (116) than trawling (16). Although an overall correlation between fish biomass and number of reads was observed, some species deviated from the common trend, which could be explained by inherent biases of each of the methods. Species distribution patterns inferred from eDNA metabarcoding data coincided with current ecological knowledge of the species, suggesting that eDNA has the potential to draw sound ecological conclusions that can contribute to fish surveillance programs. Our results support eDNA metabarcoding for broad scale marine fish diversity monitoring in the context of Directives such as the Common Fisheries Policy or the Marine Strategy Framework Directive.",

    "abstract": "The main drivers of diversification of freshwater fishes in Cuba are not yet well understood. For example, salt tolerance was thought as the main factor involved in the diversification of Gambusia punctata species group in this archipelago. However, evidence from a recent DNA barcoding survey suggested the presence of cryptic species and no correlation between species delimitation and level of salinity. In this study, we analyzed the cryptic diversification of G. punctata species group in Cuba, based on a comprehensive sampling of its distribution and including habitats with different salinity levels. We evaluated the patterns of molecular divergence of the samples by sequencing a set of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) regions and genotyping nine nuclear microsatellite loci. We also used cytochrome b gene (cytb) partial sequences and these microsatellite loci to analyze population structure inside putative species. Five mtDNA well-differentiated haplogroups were found, four of them also identified by the analysis of the microsatellite polymorphism which corresponds to two already recognized species, G. punctata, and G. rhizophorae, and three putative new species. The extent of hybrid zones between these groups is also described. In each group, populations inhabiting environments with contrasting salinity levels were identified, indicating a generalized trait not specific to G. rhizophorae. The geographic distribution of the groups suggested a strong association with major relict territories of the Cuban Archipelago that was periodically joined or split-up by changes in seawater levels and land uplifts. Salinity tolerance might have facilitated sporadic and long-distance oversea dispersal but did not prevent speciation in the Cuban archipelago.",

However, some other studies showed that MFX showed less or none activity against M. abscessus. In our study we aim to evaluate MFX activity against M. abscessus using zebrafish (ZF) model in vivo. MIC of each drugs were determined by broth microdilution method. M. abscessus labeled by CM-DiI, were micro-injected into ZF. Survival curves were determined by recording dead ZF every day. After 4 days of incubation ZF were lysed. Colony-forming unit (CFU) were enumerated and results are expressed as mean log10 CFU per ZF. Bacteria dissemination and fluorescence intensity in ZF were observed and analyzed. Inhibition rate was also calculated. In our study MFX showed good activity in vitro. But in vivo MFX showed limited restriction to M. abscessus. The association between increased survival and high dose of MFX is not significant. Same results were observed in bacterial fluorescence intensity and inhibition rates, with no significant difference when compared with no drug group (P > 0.05). However, significant difference was observed in azithromycin (AZM) group. MFX showed limited efficacy on Mycobacterium abscessus in vivo using ZF model. MFXs activity in vivo need to be confirmed.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotics are losing efficacy due to the rapid evolution and spread of resistance. Treatments targeting bacterial virulence factors have been considered as alternatives because they target virulence instead of pathogen viability, and should therefore exert weaker selection for resistance than conventional antibiotics. However, antivirulence treatments rarely clear infections, which compromises their clinical applications. Here, we explore the potential of combining antivirulence drugs with antibiotics against the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We combined two antivirulence compounds (gallium, a siderophore-quencher, and furanone C-30, a quorum sensing-inhibitor) together with four clinically relevant antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, colistin, meropenem, tobramycin) in 9x9 drug concentration matrices. We found that drug-interaction patterns were concentration dependent, with promising levels of synergies occurring at intermediate drug concentrations for certain drug pairs. We then tested whether antivirulence compounds are potent adjuvants, especially when treating antibiotic resistant clones. We found that the addition of antivirulence compounds to antibiotics could restore growth inhibition for most antibiotic resistant clones, and even abrogate or reverse selection for resistance in five drug combination cases. Molecular analyses suggest that selection against resistant clones occurs when resistance mechanisms involve restoration of protein synthesis, but not when efflux pumps are upregulated. Altogether, our work provides a first systematic analysis of antivirulence-antibiotic combinatorial treatments and suggests that such combinations have a high potential to be both effective in treating infections and in limiting the spread of antibiotic resistance.",

Motivated attentional performance and effort preference were tracked in relation to increasing time-on-task (Experiment 1) and sleep deprivation (Experiment 2). Performance decrement with time-on-task was attenuated with reward, while preference to deploy effort decreased with longer task duration. Sleep deprivation, accentuated performance decline with time-on-task, and was accompanied by greater effort-discounting. Motivated attention performance was associated with higher fronto-parietal activation, in both normal and sleep deprived conditions.

Here, to explore how temporal and reward context modulate strategy, we trained rhesus monkeys to perform a novel perceptual decision-making task with asymmetric rewards and time-varying evidence reliability. To model the choice and response time patterns, we developed a computational framework for fitting generalized drift-diffusion models (GDDMs) which flexibly accommodates diverse evidence accumulation strategies. We found that a dynamic urgency signal and leaky integration, in combination with two independent forms of reward biases, best capture behavior. We also tested how temporal structure influences urgency by systematically manipulating the temporal structure of sensory evidence, and found that the time course of urgency was affected by temporal context. Overall, our approach identified key components of cognitive mechanisms for incorporating temporal and reward structure into decisions.",

    "abstract": "The yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti is a prolific vector of arboviral and filarial diseases that largely relies on its sense of smell to find humans. To facilitate in-depth analysis of the neural circuitry underlying Ae. aegypti olfactory-driven behaviors, we generated an updated in vitro atlas for the antennal lobe olfactory brain region of this disease vector using two independent neuronal staining methods. We performed morphological reconstructions with replicate fixed, dissected and stained brain samples from adult male and female Ae. aegypti of the LVPib12 genome reference strain and determined that the antennal lobe in both sexes is comprised of approximately 80 discrete glomeruli. Guided by landmark features in the antennal lobe, we found 63 of these glomeruli are stereotypically located in spatially invariant positions within these in vitro preparations. A posteriorly positioned, mediodorsal glomerulus denoted MD1 was identified as the largest spatially invariant glomerulus in the antennal lobe. Spatial organization of glomeruli in a recently field-derived strain of Ae. aegypti from Puerto Rico was conserved, despite differences in antennal lobe shape relative to the inbred LVPib12 strain. This model in vitro atlas will serve as a useful community guide and resource to improve antennal lobe annotation and anatomically map projection patterns of neurons expressing target genes in this olfactory center. It will also facilitate the development of chemotopic maps of odor representation in the mosquito antennal lobe to decode the molecular and cellular basis of Ae. aegypti attraction to human scent and other chemosensory cues.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe olfactory system of the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti is highly tuned for the detection of human odorants, as well as other chemical cues influencing host and food-search behavior, egg-laying and mating. To provide insights into the neuroanatomical organization of the olfactory system of this globally important disease vector, we have generated an updated in vitro atlas for the primary smell processing center of the Ae. aegypti brain, called the antennal lobe. These new guide maps facilitate systematic interrogation of antennal lobe morphology and naming of associated substructures in dissected brain samples of this species labeled with two common neural staining methods. We report that landmark features of the Ae. aegypti antennal lobe morphology and spatial organization appear conserved between mosquito sexes and across geographically divergent strains of this mosquito species. An improved understanding of Ae. aegypti antennal lobe neuroanatomy and how attractive or repellent odorant stimuli are encoded in this brain center has the potential to rapidly accelerate reverse engineering of synthetic chemical blends that effectively lure, confuse or repel this major disease vector.",

    "abstract": "The most common chemogenetic neuromodulatory system, Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs), uses a non-endogenous actuator ligand to activate a modified muscarinic acetylcholine receptor that is no longer sensitive to acetylcholine. It is crucial in studies using these systems to test the potential effects of DREADD actuators prior to any DREADD transduction, so that effects of DREADDs can be attributed to the chemogenetic system rather than the actuator drug. We investigated working memory performance after injections of three DREADD agonists, clozapine, olanzapine, and deschloroclozapine, in male rhesus monkeys tested in a spatial delayed response task. Performance at 0.1 mg/kg clozapine and 0.1 mg/kg deschloroclozapine did not differ from mean performance after vehicle in any of the four subjects. Administration of 0.2 mg/kg clozapine impaired working memory function in three of the four monkeys. Two monkeys were impaired after administration of 0.1 mg/kg olanzapine and two monkeys were impaired after the 0.3 mg/kg dose of deschloroclozapine. We speculate that the unique neuropharmacology of prefrontal cortex function makes the primate prefrontal cortex especially vulnerable to off-target effects of DREADD actuator drugs with affinity for endogenous monoaminergic receptor systems. These findings underscore the importance of within-subject controls for DREADD actuator drugs to confirm that effects following DREADD receptor transduction are not due to the actuator drug itself, as well as validating the behavioral pharmacology of DREADD actuator drugs in the specific tasks under study.\n\nSignificance StatementChemogenetic technologies, such as Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs), allow for precise and remote manipulation of neuronal circuits. In the present study, we tested monkeys in a spatial delayed response task after injections of three actuator drugs - clozapine, olanzapine, and deschloroclozapine. We found that monkeys showed significant working memory impairments after 0.2 mg/kg clozapine, 0.1 mg/kg olanzapine, and 0.3 mg/kg deschloroclozapine compared to vehicle performance. In monkeys that showed impairments, these deficits were particularly apparent at longer delay periods. It is imperative to validate the drugs and dosages in the particular behavioral test to ensure any behavior after DREADD transduction can be attributed to activation of the receptors and not administration of the actuator drug itself.",

    "abstract": "The  default network (DN) becomes active when the mind is steered internally towards self-generated thoughts but turns dormant when the mind is directed externally towards the outside world. While hypotheses have been proposed to characterise the association and dissociation between different component areas of the DN, it remains unclear how they coalesce into a unitary network and fractionate into different sub-networks. Here we identified two distinct subsystems within the DN - while both subsystems show common disinterest in externally-oriented visuospatial tasks, their functional profiles differ strikingly according to the preferred contents of thoughts, preferred modes of task requirement, and causative neural dynamics among network nodes. Specifically, one subsystem comprises key nodes of the frontotemporal semantic regions. This network shows moderate dislike to visuospatial tasks, shows proclivity for task-contexts with restraints on thoughts and responses, and prefers thoughts that are focused on other people. By contrast, the other subsystem comprises the cortical midline structure and angular gyri. This network shows strong aversion to visuospatial tasks, favours task-contexts allowing free self-generated thoughts without constraints, and prefers thoughts that are focused on self. Furthermore, causative connectivity reveals that task-contexts systematically alter the dynamics within and between subsystems, suggesting flexible adaption to situational demands. This  self/inward vs. others/outward separation within the broad DN resembles recent discoveries regarding a dyadic structure within the frontoparietal network that comprises regions controlling memories/thoughts vs. regions controlling sensory-motoric processes, and echoes burgeoning views that the brain is organised with a spectrum-like architecture along gradational changes of  inward vs. outward preferences.\n\nSignificanceRather than construing the default network (DN) as  task-negative regions that passively react to off-task mind-wandering, researchers have begun to acknowledge the active role of the DN in supporting internally-directed cognition. Here we found a striking dichotomy within the DN in terms of the subsystems task-driven functional and connectivity profiles, extending beyond previous inferences using meta-analysis and resting-state fMRI. This dichotomy reflects a local manifestation of a macro-scale gradient representation spanning across the broad cerebral cortex. This cortical gradient increases its representational complexity, from primitive sensory and motoric processing, through lexical-semantic codes for language tasks, to abstract self-generated thoughts in task-free contexts. These findings enable a framework where the separate yet related literatures of semantic cognition and default-mode processes converge.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveSudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of mortality in patients in patients with intractable epilepsy. However, the pathogenesis of SUDEP seems to be poorly understood. Our previous findings showed that the incidence of seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) was markedly reduced by atomoxetine in a murine SUDEP model. Because the central NE -1 receptor (NE-1R) plays a vital role in regulating respiratory function, we hypothesized that the suppression of S-IRA by atomoxetine was mediated by NE/NE-1R interactions that can be reversed by NE-1R antagonism.\n\nMethodsWe examined whether atomoxetine-mediated suppression of S-IRA evoked by either acoustic stimulation or pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) in DBA/1 mice can be reversed by intraperitoneal (IP) and intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of prazosin, a selective antagonist of NE-1R. The content and activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a rate-limiting enzyme for NE synthesis, in the lower brainstem was measured by ELISA. Electroencephalograms (EEG) were obtained by using the PTZ-evoked SUDEP model.\n\nResultsAtomoxetine-mediated suppression of S-IRA evoked by either acoustic stimulation or PTZ was significantly reversed by low doses of IP and ICV prazosin. Neither repetitive acoustic stimulation nor S-IRA reduced TH levels in lower brainstem. However, the enzyme activity of TH levels in lower brainstem was significantly increased by mechanical ventilation with DBA/1 mice ,which makes dead DBA/1 mice suffered from S-IRA and SUDEP recover. EEG data showed that although the protective effect of atomoxetine was reversed by prazosin, neither drug affected EEG activity.\n\nSignificanceThese data suggest that deficient synthesis of NE and norepinephrinergic neurotransmission contributes to S-IRA and that the NE-1R is a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of SUDEP.",

    "abstract": "Selectively remembering or forgetting newly encountered information is essential for goal-directed behavior. It is still an open question, however, whether intentional forgetting is an active process based on the inhibition of unwanted memory traces or whether it occurs passively through reduced recruitment of selective rehearsal [1,2]. Here we show that intentional control of memory encoding relies on both, enhanced active inhibition and decreased selective rehearsal, and that these two processes can be separated in time and space. We applied representational similarity analysis (RSA [3]) and timefrequency analysis to EEG data during an item-method directed forgetting experiment [4]. We identified neural signatures of both the intentional suppression and the voluntary upregulation of item-specific representations. Successful active forgetting was associated with a downregulation of item-specific representations in an early time window, 500ms after the instruction. This process was initiated by an increase in oscillatory alpha (8-13 Hz) power, a well-established signature of neural inhibition [5,6], in occipital brain areas. During a later time window, 1500ms after the cue, intentional forgetting was associated with reduced employment of active rehearsal processes, as reflected by an attenuated upregulation of item-specific representations as compared to intentionally encoded items. Our data show that active inhibition and selective rehearsal are two separate mechanisms whose consecutive employment allows for a voluntary control of memory formation.",

Two major cytoskeletal components, microtubules and actin filaments, together with a microtubule motor, kinesin-1, and an actin motor, myosin-V, are essential for osk mRNA posterior localization. In this study, we use Staufen, an RNA-binding protein that colocalizes with osk mRNA, as a proxy for posterior determination. We demonstrate that posterior localization of osk/Staufen is determined by competition between kinesin-1 and myosin-V. While kinesin-1 removes osk/Staufen from the cortex along microtubules, myosin-V anchors osk/Staufen at the cortex. Myosin-V wins over kinesin-1 at the posterior pole due to low microtubule density at this site, while kinesin-1 wins it at anterior and lateral positions because they have high density of cortically-anchored microtubules. As a result, posterior determinants are removed from the anterior and lateral cortex but retained at the posterior pole. Thus, posterior determination of Drosophila oocyte is defined by kinesin-myosin competition, whose outcome is primarily determined by cortical microtubule density.",

    "abstract": "Establishing reliable frameworks for predicting unknown outcomes from empirical observations is of great interest to ecologists and evolutionary biologists. Strong predictability in evolutionary responses has been previously demonstrated by the repeated observation of similar phenotypes or genotypes across multiple natural or experimental populations in analogous environments. However, the degree to which evolutionary outcomes can be predicted across environmental gradients, or in fluctuating environments, remains largely unexplored. Presumably, the phenotypic evolution in an intermediate environment could be interpolated from the evolved phenotypes observed in two extreme environments, but this assumption remains to be fully tested. Here, we report on the experimental evolution of Escherichia coli under three nutritional transfer periods: every day, every 10 days, and every 100 days, representing increasing severity in feast/famine cycles. After 900 days of experimental evolution, populations experiencing intermediate durations of starvation had evolved longer times to reach maximum growth rate, smaller colony sizes, higher biofilm formation, and higher mutation rates than populations evolving in the other environmental extremes. Because the intermediately starved populations exhibit significantly high molecular parallelism, these distinct phenotypes are likely due to non-monotonic deterministic forces instead of increased stochastic forces commonly associated with fluctuating environments. Our results demonstrate novel complexities associated with evolutionary predictability across environmental gradients and highlight the risk of using interpolation in evolutionary biology.",

    "abstract": "Microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) often play a central role in organizing the cellular microtubule networks that underlie cell function. In neurons, microtubules in axons and dendrites have distinct polarities. Dendrite-specific Golgi outposts, in particular multi-compartment outposts, have emerged as regulators of acentrosomal microtubule growth, raising the question of whether outposts contribute to establishing the overall polarity of the dendritic microtubule cytoskeleton. The cis-Golgi matrix protein GM130 has roles in both the MTOC activity of Golgi and in connecting Golgi compartments to form multi-compartment units. Using a combination of genetic approaches and live imaging in a Drosophila model, we found that GM130 is not essential for the overall polarity of the dendritic microtubule cytoskeleton. However, the mislocalization of multi-compartment Golgi outposts to axons disrupts the uniform orientation of axonal microtubules. This suggests that outposts have the capacity to influence microtubule polarity and, as our data indicate, likely do so independently of microtubule nucleation mediated by the {gamma}-tubulin ring complex ({gamma}-TuRC). Altogether, our results are consistent with the model that multi-compartment Golgi outposts may locally influence microtubule polarity, but that outposts are not necessary for the overall polarity of the dendritic microtubule cytoskeleton.",

    "abstract": "NK cells regulate CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in acute viral infection, vaccination and the tumor microenvironment. NK cells also become exhausted in chronic activation settings. The mechanisms causing these ILC responses and their impact on adaptive immunity are unclear. CD8+ T cell exhaustion develops during chronic Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) infection resulting in parasite reactivation and death. How chronic T. gondii infection impacts the NK cell compartment is not known. We demonstrate that NK cells do not exhibit hallmarks of exhaustion. Their numbers are stable and they do not express high PD1 or LAG3. NK cell depletion with anti-NK1.1 is therapeutic and rescues chronic T. gondii infected mice from CD8+ T cell exhaustion dependent death, increases survival after lethal secondary challenge and reduces parasite reactivation. Anti-NK1.1 treatment increased polyfunctional CD8+ T cell responses in spleen and brain and reduced CD8+ T cell apoptosis. Chronic T. gondii infection promotes the development of a modified NK cell compartment, which does not exhibit normal NK cell behavior. This splenic CD49a-CD49b+NKp46+ NK cell population develops during the early chronic phase of infection and increases through the late chronic phase of infection. They are Ly49 and TRAIL negative and are enriched for expression of CD94/NKG2A and KLRG1. They do not produce IFN{gamma}, are IL-10 negative, do not increase PDL1 expression, but do increase CD107a on their surface. They are also absent from brain. Based on the NK cell receptor phenotype we observed NKp46 and CD94-NKG2A cognate ligands were measured. Activating NKp46 (NCR1-ligand) ligand increased and NKG2A ligand Qa-1b expression was reduced. Blockade of NKp46 also rescued the chronically infected mice from death. Immunization with a single dose non-persistent 100% protective T. gondii vaccination did not induce this cell population in the spleen, suggesting persistent infection is essential for their development. We hypothesize chronic T. gondii infection induces an NKp46 dependent modified NK cell population that reduces functional CD8+ T cells to promote persistent parasite infection in the brain. NK cell targeted therapies could enhance immunity in people with chronic infections, chronic inflammation and cancer.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionFemales are thought to have increased risk of developing posttraumatic headache (PTH) following a traumatic head injury, or concussion. However, the processes underlying this susceptibility remain unclear. We previously explored the development of PTH-like pain behaviors in a novel rat model of mild closed head injury, along with the ability of sumatriptan and an anti-calcitonin-gene-related peptide monoclonal antibody to ameliorate these behaviors. Here, we explored the development of PTH-like behaviors and the effectiveness of these headache therapies in females subjected to the same head trauma protocol.\n\nMethodsAdult female Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to a mild closed head injury using a weight-drop device. Characterization of headache and pain related behaviors included assessment of changes in cutaneous cephalic and extracephalic tactile pain sensitivity, using von Frey monofilaments. Sensitivity to headache/migraine triggers was tested by examining the effect of systemic administration of a low-dose of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN). Treatments included acute systemic administration of sumatriptan and repeated systemic administration of a mouse anti-calcitonin-gene-related peptide monoclonal antibody. Serum levels of calcitonin-gene-related peptide were measured at various time points in females and males after the head injury.\n\nResultsFemale rats subjected to a mild closed head injury developed cutaneous mechanical hyperalgesia, that was limited to the cephalic region, and was resolved 4 weeks later. Cephalic pain hypersensitivity was ameliorated by treatment with sumatriptan, but was resistant to an early and prolonged treatment with the anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody. Following the resolution of the head injury-evoked cephalic hypersensitivity, administration of GTN produced a renewed and pronounced cephalic and extracephalic pain hypersensitivity that was inhibited by sumatriptan, but only partially by the anti-CGRP treatment. CGRP serum levels were elevated in females but not in males at 7 days post head injury.\n\nConclusionsDevelopment of PTH-like pain behaviors following a mild closed head injury, and responsiveness to treatment in rats is sexually dimorphic. When compared to males, female rats display a prolonged state of cephalic hyperalgesia, increased responsiveness to a headache trigger, and a poorer effectiveness of an early and prolonged anti-CGRP treatment. The increased risk of females to develop PTH may be linked to enhanced responsiveness of peripheral and/or central pain pathways and a mechanism independent of peripheral CGRP signaling.",

Our study examined two grapevine scion varieties ( Chardonnay and  Cabernet Sauvignon) grafted to 15 different rootstocks and determined the effect of rootstocks on eight traits important to viticulture. We assessed the vines across five years and identified both year and variety as contributing strongly to trait variation. The effect of rootstock was relatively consistent across years and varieties, explaining between 8.99% and 9.78% of the variation in growth-related traits including yield, pruning weight, berry weight, and Ravaz index (yield to pruning weight ratio). Increases in yield due to rootstock were generally the result of increases in berry weight, likely due to increased water uptake by vines grafted to a particular rootstock. We demonstrated a greater than 50% increase in yield, pruning weight, or Ravaz index by choosing the optimal rootstock, indicating that rootstock choice is crucial for grape growers looking to improve vine performance.",

    "abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) signal through allostery, and it is increasingly clear that chemically distinct agonists can produce different receptor-based effects. It has been proposed that agonists selectively promote receptors to recruit one cellular interacting partner over another, introducing allosteric  bias into the signaling system. However, the core underlying hypothesis - that different agonists drive GPCRs to engage different cytoplasmic proteins in living cells - remains untested due to the complexity of downstream readouts through which receptor-proximal interactions are typically inferred. Here we describe a scalable cell-based assay to overcome this challenge, based on the use of engineered GPCR-interacting proteins as orthogonal biosensors that are disconnected from endogenous transduction mechanisms. Focusing on opioid receptors, we directly demonstrate differences between protein probe recruitment produced by chemically distinct opioid ligands in living cells. We then show how the selective recruitment applies to GRK2, a biologically relevant opioid receptor regulator protein, through discrete interactions of GRK2 with receptors or with G protein beta-gamma subunits which are differentially promoted by agonists.",

    "abstract": "In Angiosperms, perennials typically present much higher levels of inbreeding depression than annuals. One hypothesis to explain this pattern stems from the observation that inbreeding depression is expressed across multiple life stages in Angiosperms. It posits that increased inbreeding depression in more long-lived species could be explained by differences in the way mutations affect fitness in these species, through the life stages at which they are expressed. In this study, we investigate this hypothesis. We combine a physiological growth model and multilocus population genetics approaches to describe a full genotype-to-phenotype-to-fitness map. We study the behaviour of mutations affecting growth or survival, and explore their consequences in terms of inbreeding depression and mutation load. Although our results only agree with empirical data within a narrow range of conditions, we argue that they may point us towards the type of traits susceptible to underlie inbreeding depression in long-lived species, that is traits under sufficiently strong selection, on which selection decreases sharply as life expectancy increases. Then, we study the role deleterious mutations maintained at mutation-selection balance may play in the coevolution between growth and survival strategies.\n\nDescription of the manuscriptThe main text of the manuscript, excluding captions and headers, is 5712 words long.

To identify the main factors driving the ecology of ham and its spoilage, we designed a study encompassing five variables related to ham production: type of storage during meat transportation, churning speed, drain-off time, slicing line and O2 packaging permeability. We obtained about 200 samples from the same facility and we characterized i) their microbiota based on gyrB amplicon sequencing ii) their production of spoilage-related metabolites based on E-Nose analysis and enzymatic assays. The slicing was the most critical step, shaping two general types of microbiota according to the slicing line: one dominated by Carnobacterium divergens and another one dominated by Leuconostoc carnosum and Serratia proteamaculans. Regarding metabolites production, L. carnosum was associated to D-lactic acid, ethanol and acetic acid production, whereas Serratia proteamaculans was associated to acetic acid production. This last species prevailed with highly O2-permeable packaging. Within a given slicing line, we observed campaign-based variations, with Lactobacillus sakei, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Carnobacterium maltaromaticum prevalent in summer. L. sakei was associated with L-lactic acid production and C. maltaromaticum with formic and acetic acid productions.",

Because of this specific deficit to visual imagery, aphantasia serves as an ideal population for probing the nature of representations in visual memory, particularly the interplay of object, spatial, and symbolic information. Here, we conducted a large-scale online study of aphantasics and revealed a dissociation in object and spatial content in their memory representations. Sixty-one aphantasics and matched controls with typical imagery studied real-world scene images, and were asked to draw them from memory, and then later copy them during a matched perceptual condition. Drawings were objectively quantified by 2,795 online scorers for object and spatial details. Aphantasics recalled significantly fewer objects than controls, with less color in their drawings, and an increased reliance on verbal scaffolding. However, aphantasics showed incredibly high spatial accuracy, equivalent to controls, and made significantly fewer memory errors. These differences between groups only manifested during recall, with no differences between groups during the matched perceptual condition. This object-specific memory impairment in aphantasics provides evidence for separate systems in memory that support object versus spatial information.",

This training regimen enhanced the preference for the initially less desirable food reward. We probed whether this change in subjective preference involved dopamine signaling or the orbital frontal cortex (OFC) given that these neural systems contribute to reward valuation. Systemic dopamine receptor antagonism attenuated anticipatory responding during training sessions but did not prevent the change in reward preference elicited by incurred temporal costs. OFC lesions had no effect on anticipatory responding during training or on the change in reward preference. These findings collectively illustrate that the neural systems involved with economic assessments of reward value are not contributing to changes in subjective preference.",

Though it has been used to translate the coding sequences from other tunicate species on a case-by-case basis, it is has not been investigated whether this can be done systematically. This is an important because a) some tunicate mitochondrial sequences are currently translated with the invertebrate code by repositories such as NCBIs GenBank, and b) uncertainties about the genetic code to use can complicate or introduce errors in phylogenetic studies based on translated mitochondrial protein sequences.\n\nMethodsWe collected publicly available nucleotide sequences for non-ascidian tunicates including appendicularians such as Oikopleura dioica, translated them using the ascidian mitochondrial code, and built multiple sequence alignments covering all tunicate classes.\n\nResultsAll tunicates studied here appear to translate AGR codons to glycine instead of serine (invertebrates) or as a stop codon (vertebrates), as initially described in ascidians.

Most ex vivo studies of the lymph node begin by reducing it to a cell suspension, thus losing the spatial organization, or fixing it, thus losing the ability to make repeated measurements. Live murine lymph node tissue slices offer the potential to retain spatial complexity and dynamic accessibility, but their viability, level of immune activation, and retention of antigen-specific functions have not been validated. Here we systematically characterized live murine lymph node slices as a platform to study immunity. Live lymph node slices maintained the expected spatial organization and cell populations while reflecting the 3D spatial complexity of the organ. Slices collected under optimized conditions were comparable to cell suspensions in terms of both 24-hr viability and inflammation. Slices responded to T cell receptor cross-linking with increased surface marker expression and cytokine secretion, in some cases more strongly than matched lymphocyte cultures. Furthermore, slices processed protein antigens, and slices from vaccinated animals responded to ex vivo challenge with antigen-specific cytokine secretion. In summary, lymph node slices provide a versatile platform to investigate immune functions in spatially organized tissue, enabling well-defined stimulation, time-course analysis, and parallel read-outs.",

    "abstract": "Frequency following responses (FFRs) can be evoked by a wide range of auditory stimuli, but for many stimulus parameters the effect on FFR strength is not fully understood. This complicates the comparison of earlier studies and the design of new studies. Furthermore, the most optimal stimulus parameters are unknown. To help resolve this issue, we investigated the effects of four important stimulus parameters and their interactions on the FFR. FFRs were measured in 16 normal hearing subjects evoked by stimuli with four levels of stimulus complexity (amplitude modulated noise, artificial vowels, natural vowels and nonsense words), three frequencies (around 105 Hz, 185 Hz and 245 Hz), three frequency contours (upward sweeping, downward sweeping and flat) and three vowels (Flemish /a:/, /u:/, and /i:/). We found that FFRs evoked by artificial vowels were on average 4 to 6 dB SNR larger than responses evoked by the other stimulus complexities, probably because of (unnaturally) strong higher harmonics. Moreover, response amplitude decreased with stimulus frequency but response SNR did not. Thirdly, frequency variation within the stimulus did not impact FFR strength, but only when rate of change remained low (e.g. not the case for sweeping natural vowels). Finally, the vowel /i:/ appeared to evoke larger response amplitudes compared to /a:/ and /u:/, but analysis power was too small to confirm this statistically. Differences in response strength between evoking vowels have been suggested to stem from destructive interference between response components. We show how a model of the auditory periphery can simulate these interference patterns and predict response strength. Altogether, the results of this study can guide stimulus choice for future FFR research and practical applications.",

    "abstract": "Human skin is a prime vaccination site containing multiple antigen presenting cells (APC), including Langerhans cells (LC) and dendritic cells (DC). APC deliver antigens to lymph nodes for induction of adaptive immunity through stimulating antigen specific T- and B-cells. Since intradermal (ID) injections require specific training, easy applicable delivery systems like laser microporation are emerging. In mice, combination of laser treatment and allergen injection showed enhanced T-cell responses and skewing of B-cell responses without adjuvants. However, it remains to be elucidated whether laser microporation can alter human skin DC phenotype and function without adjuvants. In an ex-vivo human skin explant model, we compared ID injection and laser microporation as anti-tumor vaccination strategy. A melanoma specific synthetic long peptide and multivalent dendrimer with gp100 antigen were used as vaccine formulation to measure APC phenotype, emigration and ability to stimulate gp100 specific CD8+ T-cells. We show that skin APC phenotype and emigration capacity was similar after laser microporation and ID injection. However, laser microporation reduced vaccine uptake by APC, resulting in decreased induction of gp100 specific CD8+ T-cell activation. To conclude, in our human skin model ID injection remains the most potent strategy to deliver antigens to skin APC for T-cell induction.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=77 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/861930v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5b7191org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17d16fcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1701e08org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c3ab3d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Despite the high incidence of acute and chronic pain in the general population, the efficacy of currently available medications is unsatisfactory. Insufficient management of pain has a profound impact on the quality of life and can have serious physical, psychological, social, and economic consequences. This unmet need reflects a failure to develop novel classes of analgesic drugs with superior clinical properties and lower risk of abuse. Nevertheless, recent advances in our understanding of the neurobiology of pain are offering new opportunities for developing different therapeutic approaches. Among those, the activation of M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which play a key role in the cholinergic regulation of the nociceptive transmission, constitutes one of the most promising strategies. We have recently developed a small library of novel pharmacological agents by merging the structures of known orthosteric and allosteric muscarinic ligands through their molecular hybridization, an emerging approach in medicinal chemistry based on the combination of pharmacophoric moieties of different bioactive substances to produce a new compound with improved pharmacological properties. Herein we report the functional characterization of the new ligands in vitro and the assessment of their efficacy as analgesic agents and tolerability in mice. This work provides new insights for the development and optimization of novel muscarinic hybrid compounds for the management of pain.",

    "abstract": "G-protein gated, inwardly rectifying potassium channels (GIRK) mediate inhibitory transmission in brain, heart, and adrenal cortex. GIRK4 (KCNJ5) subunits are abundant in the heart and adrenal cortex. Multiple mutations of KCNJ5 cause primary aldosteronism (PA). According to a leading concept, mutations in the pore region of GIRK4 cause loss of K+ selectivity; the ensuing Na+ influx depolarizes zona glomerulosa cells and activates voltage gated Ca2+ channels, inducing hypersecretion of aldosterone. The concept of selectivity loss has been extended to mutations in cytosolic domains of GIRK4 channels, remote from the pore region. We expressed GIRK4R52H, GIRK4E246K, and GIRK4G247R mutants in Xenopus oocytes and human adrenocortical carcinoma cell line (HAC15). Whole-cell currents of heterotetrameric GIRK1/4R52H and GIRK1/4E246K (but not GIRK1/4G247R) channels were greatly reduced compared to GIRK1/4WT. Nevertheless, all heterotetrameric mutants retained full K+ selectivity and inward rectification. When expressed as homotetramers, only GIRK4WT, but none of the mutants, produced whole-cell currents. Confocal imaging, single channel and Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) analyses showed: 1) reduction of membrane abundance of all mutated channels, especially as homotetramers, 2) impaired interaction with G{beta}{gamma} subunits, and 3) reduced open probability of GIRK1/4R52H. VU0529331, a GIRK4 opener, activated homotetrameric GIRK4G247R channels, but not GIRK4R52H and GIRK4E246K. Our results suggest impaired gating (GIRK4R52H) and expression in plasma membrane (all mutants). We suggest that, contrary to the previously proposed mechanism, R52H and E246K mutants are loss-of-function rather than gain-of-function/selectivity-loss mutants. Hence, GIRK4 openers may be a potential course of treatment for patients with cytosolic N- and C-terminal mutations.\n\nSignificance StatementMutations in KCNJ5 gene, which encodes for the GIRK4 subunit of G-protein inwardly rectifying K+ channels, are the main cause of primary aldosteronism, a major contributor to secondary hypertension. We report that three mutations in the cytosolic domain of GIRK4 cause loss-of-function, contrary to the prevailing concept that these mutations cause loss of selectivity and subsequent depolarization, i.e. essentially gain-of-function. Our findings correct the existing misconception regarding the biophysical mechanism that impairs the channel function, and may provide indications for future personalized treatment of the disease.",

This is an important question in the tundra where vegetation shifts are occurring across the entire biome, and where soil organic carbon stocks are large and vulnerable to environmental change.\nC_LIO_LITo study how traits affect carbon cycling in the tundra, we built a model that explained carbon cycling (above-ground and soil organic carbon stocks, and photosynthetic and respiratory fluxes) with abiotic conditions (air temperature and soil moisture), plant community functional composition (average plant height, leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and specific leaf area (SLA)), and functional diversity (weighted standard deviations of the traits). Data was collected from an observational study setting from northern Finland.\nC_LIO_LIThe explanatory power of the models was relatively high, but a large part of variation in soil organic carbon stocks remained unexplained. Plant height was the strongest predictor of all carbon cycling variables except soil carbon stocks. Communities of larger plants were associated with larger CO2 fluxes and above-ground carbon stocks. Communities with fast leaf economics (i.e. high SLA and low LDMC) had higher photosynthesis, ecosystem respiration, and soil organic carbon stocks.\nC_LIO_LIWithin-community variability in plant height, SLA, and LDMC affected ecosystem functions differently. SLA and LDMC diversity increased CO2 fluxes and soil organic carbon stocks, while height diversity increased the above-ground carbon stock. The contributions of functional diversity metrics to ecosystem functioning were about as important as those of average SLA and LDMC traits.\nC_LIO_LISynthesis: Plant height, SLA, and LDMC have clear effects on tundra carbon cycling. The importance of functional diversity highlights a potentially important mechanism controlling the vast tundra carbon pools that should be better recognized. More research on root traits and decomposer communities is needed to understand the below-ground mechanisms regulating carbon cycling in the tundra.\nC_LI",

The cooperation of heat shock protein (Hsp) 70 and 90 is important for folding of a select number of cellular proteins that are crucial for cyto-protection and development of the parasites. Hsp70 and Hsp90 are brought into a functional complex that allows substrate exchange by stress inducible protein 1 (STI1), also known as Hsp70-Hsp90 organizing protein (Hop). P. falciparum Hop (PfHop) co-localises and occurs in complex with the parasite cytosolic chaperones, PfHsp70-1 and PfHsp90. Here, we characterised the structure of recombinant PfHop using synchrotron radiation circular dichroism (SRCD) and small-angle X-ray scattering. Structurally, PfHop is a monomeric, elongated but folded protein, in agreement with its predicted TPR domain structure. Using SRCD, we established that PfHop is unstable at temperatures higher than 40 {degrees}C. This suggests that PfHop is less stable at elevated temperatures compared to its functional partner, PfHsp70-1, that is reportedly stable at temperatures as high as 80 {degrees}C. These findings contribute towards our understanding of the role of the Hop-mediated functional partnership between Hsp70 and Hsp90.",

    "abstract": "Allophylus serratus is a medicinal plant used traditionally as anti-inflammatory agent. The main objectives of this study are to identify phytochemical compounds that have anti-inflammatory properties from the leaf extracts of Allophylus serratus and to search for cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme inhibitors through molecular docking. From the GC-MS analysis of leaf extracts of this plant, various phytochemicals were identified. About 10of these phytochemical compounds were analyzed for their drug likeliness based on Lipinskis rule of five and inhibitor property against the cyclooxygenase (COX-2) enzyme, a protein responsible for inflammation The phytochemical compounds which satisfy the Lipinskis rule such as 1H-Benzocycloheptene, 2,4a,5,6,7,8-hexahydro-3,5,5,9-tetramethyl-,(R) and Sulfurous acid, dipentyl ester were subjected to docking experiments using AutoDock Vina. The results from molecular docking study revealed that 1H-Benzocycloheptene, 2,4a,5,6,7,8-hexahydro-3,5,5,9-tetramethyl-, (R)-, Sulfurous acid, dipentyl ester and 1,2-Benzenedicarboxylic acid, bis(2-methylpropyl) ester bind effectively to the active site region of COX-2 with a binding energy of -8.9, -8.4, and -7.9, respectively. The binding energy of the phyto-compounds were compared with the known antiinflammatory drug Diclofenac that inhibit COX-2 enzyme. It was found that the phytochemical compounds from leaf extracts of Allophylus serratus have strong inhibitory effect on COX-2 enzyme and as a result they have potential anti-inflammatory medicinal values. Thus the study puts forth experimental validation for traditional antidote and these phyto-compounds could be further promoted as potential lead molecule.",

    "abstract": "Jerusalem artichoke is widely known for its inulin-enriched tubers. Recently the opportunity has been arisen to involve the whole plant in biorefinery concept due to its high lignocellulose biomass and tuber production. This paper focuses on the repeatedly harvestable green biomass of Jerusalem artichoke. Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Electrospray Ionization/Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-MS) was applied to identify the phytochemicals in Jerusalem artichoke leaf protein concentrate (JAPC) thermally extracted from green biomass of three clones, i.e., Alba, Fuseau and Kalevala. Amino acid and fatty acid profiles as well as yield of JAPC were also analyzed. The UHPLC-ESI-MS analyses showed that no toxic phytochemicals were identified in JAPC. The results revealed, also, that JAPC is not only essential-amino acids-rich but also contains substantial amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids (66-68%) such as linolenic and linoleic acids. Linolenic acid represented 39-43% of total lipid content; moreover, the ratio between {omega}-6 and {omega}-3 essential fatty acids in JAPC was [~]0.6: 1. Using UHPLC-ESI-MS, the following hydroxylated methoxyflavones were for the first time identified in JAPC, i.e., dimethoxy-tetrahydroxyflavone, dihydroxy-methoxyflavone, hymenoxin and nevadensin. These compounds are medically important since they are referred to as anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory and antioxidants. Also, liquiritigenin - estrogenic-like compound - was identified in JAPC alongside the following terpenes, i,e., loliolide and dihydroactinidiolide. However, no remarkable differences of phytochemicals, fatty acids and amino acids composition were seen among Jerusalem artichoke clones. The green biomass of tested clones ranged between 5 to 5.6 kg m-2 and JAPC yield varied from 28.6 to 31.2 g DM kg-1 green biomass with total protein content, on average, of 33.3%. According to our knowledge, this paper is the first scientific report highlighting bioactive substances in JAPC such as PUFA phytochemicals. These results clearly prove that JAPC is a valuable product which can direct towards human and animal nutrition as well as it can serve as basic material for different industrial purposes.",

    "abstract": "CD47 is an immune checkpoint protein that downregulates both the innate and adaptive anti-tumor immune response via its counter receptor SIRP. Biologics, including humanized CD47 monoclonal antibodies and decoy SIRP receptors, that block the SIRP-CD47 interaction, are currently being developed as cancer immunotherapy agents. However, adverse side effects and limited penetration of tumor tissue associated with their structure and large size may impede their clinical application. We recently developed a quantitative high throughput screening assay platform to identify small molecules that disrupt the binding of SIRP and CD47 as an alternative approach to these protein-based therapeutics. Here, we report on the development and optimization of a cell-based binding assay to validate active small molecules from our biochemical screening effort. This assay has a low volume, high capacity homogenous format that relies on laser scanning cytometry (LSC) and associated techniques to enhance signal to noise measurement of cell surface binding. The LSC assay is specific, concentration dependent, and validated for the two major human SIRP variants (V1 and V2), with results that parallel those of our biochemical data as well as published studies. The LSC assay also confirmed published studies, such as the inhibition of amino-terminal pyroglutamate formation in CD47 disrupts SIRP binding. SIRP-CD47 interaction could be quantitatively measured in live and fixed tumor cells. Use of fixed cells reduces the burden of cell maintenance and provides stable cell standards to control for inter- and intra-assay variations. We also demonstrate the utility of the assay to characterize the activity of the first reported small molecule antagonists of the SIRP-CD47 interaction. This assay will support the screening of thousands of compounds to identify or validate active small molecules as hits, develop structure activity relationships and assist in the optimization of hits to leads by a typical iterative medicinal chemistry campaign.",
