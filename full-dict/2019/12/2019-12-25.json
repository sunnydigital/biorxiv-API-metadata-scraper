    "abstract": "Maternal obesity has become a growing global health concern that may predispose the offspring to medical conditions later in life. However, the metabolic link between maternal pre-pregnant obesity and healthy offspring has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we conducted a case-control study using coupled untargeted and targeted metabolomics approach, from the newborn cord blood metabolomes associated with a matched maternal pre-pregnant obesity cohort of 28 cases and 29 controls. The subjects were recruited from multi-ethnic populations in Hawaii, including rarely reported Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders (NHPI). We found that maternal obesity was the most important factor contributing to differences in cord blood metabolomics. Using elastic net regularization based logistic regression model, we identified 29 metabolites as potential early-life biomarkers manifesting intrauterine effect of maternal obesity, with accuracy as high as 0.947 after adjusting for clinical confounding (maternal and paternal age and ethnicity, parity and gravidity). We validated the model results in a subsequent set of samples (N=30) with an accuracy of 0.822. Among the metabolites, six metabolites (galactonic acid, butenylcarnitine, 2-hydroxy-3-methylbutyric acid, phosphatidylcholine diacyl C40:3, 1,5-anhydrosorbitol, and phosphatidylcholine acyl-alkyl 40:3) were individually and significantly different between the maternal obese vs. norm-weight groups. Interestingly, Hydroxy-3-methylbutyric acid showed significnatly higher levels in cord blood from the NHPI group, compared to asian and caucasian groups. In summary, significant associations were observed between maternal pre-pregnant obesity and offspring metabolomics alternation at birth, revealing the inter-generational impact of maternal obesity.",

Given the importance and scale of the novel interactions identified in these proteome-wide XL-MS studies, thorough quality assessment is critical. Almost all current XL-MS studies validate cross-links against known 3D structures of representative protein complexes. However, current structure validation approach only includes cross-links where both peptides mapped to the 3D structures. Here we provide theoretical and experimental evidence demonstrating this approach can drastically underestimate error rates for proteome-wide XL-MS datasets. Addressing current shortcomings, we propose and demonstrate a comprehensive set of four metrics, including orthogonal experimental validation to thoroughly assess quality of proteome-wide XL-MS datasets.",

    "abstract": "Insertions and deletions (indels) make a critical contribution to human genetic variation. While indel calling has improved significantly, it lags dramatically in performance relative to single-nucleotide variant calling, something of particular concern for clinical genomics where larger scale disruption of the open reading frame can commonly cause disease. Here, we present a machine learning-based approach to the detection of indel breakpoints called Scotch. This novel approach improves sensitivity to larger variants dramatically by leveraging sequencing metrics and signatures of poor read alignment. We also introduce a meta-analytic indel caller, called Metal, that performs a \"smart intersection\" of Scotch and currently available tools to be maximally sensitive to large variants. We use new benchmark datasets and Sanger sequencing to compare Scotch and Metal to current gold standard indel callers, achieving unprecedented levels of precision and recall. We demonstrate the impact of these improvements by applying this tool to a cohort of patients with undiagnosed disease, generating plausible novel candidates in 21 out of 26 undiagnosed cases. We highlight the diagnosis of one patient with a 498-bp deletion in HNRNPA1 missed by traditional indel-detection tools.",

    "abstract": "Microbes face intense competition in the natural world, and so need to wisely allocate their resources to multiple functions, in particular to metabolism. Understanding competition among metabolic strategies that are subject to trade-offs is therefore crucial for deeper insight into the competition, cooperation, and community assembly of microorganisms. In this work, we evaluate competing metabolic strategies within an ecological context by considering not only how the environment influences cell growth, but also how microbes shape their chemical environment. Utilizing chemostat-based resource-competition models, we exhibit a set of intuitive and general procedures for assessing metabolic strategies. Using this framework, we are able to relate and unify multiple metabolic models, and to demonstrate how the fitness landscape of strategies becomes intrinsically dynamic due to species-environment feedback. Such dynamic fitness landscapes produce rich behaviors, and prove to be crucial for ecological and evolutionary stable coexistence in all the models we examined.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT/ SUMMARYOligodendrocytes (OLs) are the only myelinating glia in the central nervous system (CNS). In congenital myelin disorders, OL dysfunction or death results in loss of myelin. This causes progressive and irreversible impairment to motor and cognitive functions, and is amongst the most disabling neurological disorder.\n\nNeonatal engraftment by glial progenitor cells (GPCs) allows the robust myelination of congenitally dysmyelinated brain, thereby preserving brain function and quality of life of patients. However, endogenous sources of glial progenitors are hard to obtain without causing secondary injury, while use of exogenous sources such as embryonic stem cells and induced-pluripotent stem cells face considerable ethical and safety issues.\n\nTo circumvent such hurdles, we asked whether NG2+ cells in the bone marrow could be a potential cell source for GPCs. We successfully generated glial progenitor cells (GPCs) from human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) from 3 donors using a 14- day induction protocol. The generated hBMSC-GPCs were highly enriched in OPC marker expression, including OLIG2, PDGFR, NG2, SOX10 and O4, and showed efficient differentiation into myelinogenic oligodendrocytes when transplanted into postnatal day 7 (P7) myelin-deficient shiverer mice. Remyelination of the shiverer mouse brain significantly extended lifespan and improved motor function.\n\nThe novel induction protocol described here provides a method for fast, simple and effective glial therapy for myelin disorders, overcoming existent hurdles of cell source restriction and time frame requirement.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=153 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/658997v8_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@104a62corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@399a67org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c81ee1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16374da_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Highlights- Human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) can be programmed to myelinating glia (GPCs, glial progenitor cells), via a novel 14-day in vitro induction protocol\n- Transplantation of these hBM-GPCs robustly remyelinated myelin deficient shiverer mice.\n- hBM-GPC transplant significantly extended lifespan, increased body weight and improved motor function",

    "abstract": "De novo protein-coding innovations sometimes emerge from ancestrally non-coding DNA, despite the expectation that translating random sequences is overwhelmingly likely to be deleterious. The \"pre-adapting selection\" hypothesis claims that emergence is facilitated by prior, low-level translation of non-coding sequences via molecular errors. It predicts that selection on polypeptides translated only in error is strong enough to matter, and is strongest when erroneous expression is high. To test this hypothesis, we examined non-coding sequences located downstream of stop codons (i.e. those potentially translated by readthrough errors) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes. We identified a class of \"fragile\" proteins under strong selection to reduce readthrough, which are unlikely substrates for co-option. Among the remainder, sequences showing evidence of readthrough translation, as assessed by ribosome profiling, encoded C-terminal extensions with higher intrinsic structural disorder, supporting the pre-adapting selection hypothesis. The cryptic sequences beyond the stop codon, rather than spillover effects from the regular C-termini, are primarily responsible for the higher disorder. Results are robust to controlling for the fact that stronger selection also reduces the length of C-terminal extensions. These findings indicate that selection acts on 3' UTRs in S. cerevisiae to purge potentially deleterious variants of cryptic polypeptides, acting more strongly in genes that experience more readthrough errors.",

Above the upper boundary of this interval, there is four-stage damping of the spike amplitude: 1) minor primary damping, which reflects a typical transient to stationary dynamic state, 2) plateau of nearly undamped periodic oscillations, 3) strong damping, and 4) reaching a constant asymptotic value of the neuron potential. We have shown that in the vicinity of the asymptote the Morris-Lecar equations can be reduced to the standard equation for exponentially damped harmonic oscillations. Importantly, all coefficients of this equation can be explicitly expressed through parameters of the original Morris-Lecar model, enabling direct comparison of the numerical and analytical solutions for the neuron potential dynamics at later stages of the spike amplitude damping.",

This is the first system to use competitive exclusion to create a stable two-species consortia and the first to only require the engineering of a single strain.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are central components of the innate immune system providing protection against pathogens. Yet, serum and tissue concentrations vary between individuals and disease conditions. We demonstrate that the human AMP LL-37 lowers the susceptibility to vancomycin in the community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) strain FPR3757 (USA300). Vancomycin is used to treat serious MRSA infections, but treatment failures occur despite MRSA strains being tested susceptible according to standard susceptibility methods. Exposure to physiologically relevant concentrations of LL-37 increased the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of S. aureus towards vancomycin by 75% and resulted in shortened lag-phase and increased colony formation at sub-inhibitory concentrations of vancomycin. Computer simulations using a mathematical antibiotic treatment model indicated that a small increase in MIC might decrease the efficacy of vancomycin in clearing an S. aureus infection. This prediction was supported in a Galleria mellonella infection model, where exposure of S. aureus to LL-37 abolished the antimicrobial effect of vancomycin. Thus, physiologically relevant concentrations of LL-37 reduce susceptibility to vancomycin, indicating that tissue and host-specific variations in LL-37 concentrations may influence vancomycin susceptibility in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Background and PurposeDespite the continuing efforts in multimodal assessment of the motor system after stroke, conclusive findings on the complementarity of functional and structural metrics of the corticospinal tract (CST) integrity and the role of the contralesional hemisphere are still missing. The aim of this work was to find the best combination of the motor system parameters, allowing classification of patients into three predefined groups of upper limb motor recovery.\n\nMethods35 chronic ischemic stroke patients (47 [26-66] y.o., 29 [6-58] months post-stroke) with only supratentorial lesion and unilateral upper extremity weakness were enrolled. Patients were divided into three groups depending on the upper limb motor recovery. Non-parametric statistical tests and regression analysis were used to investigate the relationships among structural and functional motor system parameters, probed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). In addition, stratification rules were tested, using a decision tree classifier to identify parameters explaining motor recovery.\n\nResultsFractional anisotropy (FA) ratio in the internal capsule (IC) and absence/presence of motor evoked potentials (MEPs), were equally discriminative of the worst motor outcome group (96% accuracy). MEP presence diverged for two investigated hand muscles. Concurrently, for the three recovery groups classification, the best parameter combination was: IC FA ratio and Frechet distance between the contralesional and ipsilesional CST FA profiles (91% accuracy). No other metrics had any additional value for patients classification.\n\nConclusionsThis study demonstrates that IC FA ratio and MEPs absence are equally important markers for poor recovery. Importantly, we found that MEPs should be controlled in more than one hand muscle. Finally, we show that better separation between different motor recovery groups may be achieved when considering the whole CST FA profile.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant neuroendocrine signaling is frequent yet poorly understood feature of prostate cancers. Membrane metalloendopeptidase (MME) is responsible for the catalytic inactivation of neuropeptide substrates, and is downregulated in nearly 50% of prostate cancers. However its role in prostate carcinogenesis, including formation of castration-resistant prostate carcinomas, remains uncertain. Here we report that MME cooperates with PTEN in suppression of carcinogenesis by controlling activities of prostate stem/progenitor cells. Lack of MME and PTEN results in development of adenocarcinomas characterized by propensity for vascular invasion and formation of proliferative neuroendocrine clusters after castration. Effects of MME on prostate stem/progenitor cells depend on its catalytic activity and can be recapitulated by addition of the MME substrate, gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP). Knockdown or inhibition of GRP receptor (GRPR) abrogate effects of MME deficiency, and delay growth of human prostate cancer xenografts by reducing the number of cancer propagating cells. In sum, our study provides a definitive proof of tumor suppressive role of MME, links GRP/GRPR signaling to the control of prostate stem/progenitor cells, and shows how dysregulation of such signaling may promote formation of castration-resistant prostate carcinomas. It also identifies GRPR as a valuable target for therapies aimed at eradication of cancer propagating cells in prostate cancers with MME downregulation.",

    "abstract": "Much remains to be discovered about the intersection of tissue-specific transcription control and the epigenetics of skeletal muscle (SkM), a very complex and dynamic organ. From four gene families, ASB, LRRC, TMEM, and OSBPL, we chose 21 genes that are preferentially expressed in human SkM relative to 52 other tissue types and analyzed relationships between their tissue-specific epigenetics and expression. We also compared their genetics, proteomics, and descriptions in the literature. For this study, we identified genes with little or no previous descriptions of SkM functionality (ASB4, ASB8, ASB10, ASB12, ASB16, LRRC14B, LRRC20, LRRC30, TMEM52, TMEM233, OSBPL6/ORP6, and OSBPL11/ORP11) and included genes whose SkM functions had been previously addressed (ASB2, ASB5, ASB11, ASB15, LRRC2, LRRC38, LRRC39, TMEM38A/TRIC-A, and TMEM38B/TRIC-B). Among the transcription-related SkM epigenetic features that we identified were super-enhancers, promoter DNA hypomethylation, lengthening of constitutive low-methylated promoter regions, and SkM-related enhancers for one gene embedded in a neighboring gene (e.g., ASB8-PFKM, LRRC39-DBT, and LRRC14B-PLEKHG4B gene-pairs). In addition, highly or lowly co-expressed long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes probably regulate several of these genes. Our findings give insights into tissue-specific epigenetic patterns and functionality of related genes in a gene family and can elucidate normal and disease-related regulation of gene expression in SkM.",

    "abstract": "The genetic effect explains the causality from genetic mutation to the development of complex diseases. Existing genome-wide association study (GWAS) approaches are always built under a linear assumption, restricting their generalization in dissecting complicated causality such as the recessive genetic effect. Therefore, a sophisticated and general GWAS model that can work with different types of genetic effects is highly desired. Here, we introduce a Deep Association Kernel learning (DAK) model to enable automatic causal genotype encoding for GWAS at pathway level. DAK can detect both common and rare variants with complicated genetic effects that existing approaches fail. When applied to real-world GWAS data, our approach discovered potential casual pathways that could be explained by alternative biological studies.",

    "abstract": "Monogenetic diseases provide unique opportunity for studying complex, clinical states that underlie neurological severity. Loss of glycine decarboxylase (GLDC) can severely impact neurological development as seen in non-ketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH). NKH is a neuro-metabolic disorder lacking quantitative predictors of disease states. It is characterized by elevation of glycine, seizures and failure to thrive, but glycine reduction often fails to confer neurological benefit, suggesting need for alternate tools to distinguish severe from attenuated disease. A major challenge has been that there are 255 unique disease-causing missense mutations in GLDC, of which 206 remain entirely uncharacterized. Here we report a Multiparametric Mutation Score (MMS) developed by combining in silico predictions of stability, evolutionary conservation and protein interaction models and suitable to assess 251 of 255 mutations. In addition, we created a quantitative scale of clinical disease severity comprising of four major disease domains (seizure, cognitive failure, muscular and motor control and brain-malformation) to comprehensively score patient symptoms identified in 131 clinical reports published over the last 15 years. The resulting patient Clinical Outcomes Scores (COS) were used to optimize the MMS for biological and clinical relevance and yield a patient Weighted Multiparametric Mutation Score (WMMS) that separates severe from attenuated neurological disease (p < 3.5e-5). Our study provides understanding for developing quantitative tools to predict clinical severity of neurological disease and a clinical scale that advances monitoring disease progression needed to evaluate new treatments for NKH.",
