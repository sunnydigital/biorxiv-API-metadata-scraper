    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe leaf economics spectrum (LES) is based on a suite of leaf traits related to plant functioning and ranges from resource-conservative to resource-acquisitive strategies. However, the relationships with root traits, and the associated belowground plant functioning such as N uptake, including nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+), is still poorly known. Additionally, environmental variations occurring both in time and in space could uncouple LES from root traits. We explored, in subalpine grasslands, the relationships between leaf and root morphological traits for 3 dominant perennial grass species, and to what extent they contribute to the whole-plant economics spectrum. We also investigated the link between this spectrum and NO3- and NH4+ uptake rates, as well as the variations of uptake across four grasslands differing by the land-use history at peak biomass and in autumn. Although poorly correlated with leaf traits, root traits contributed to an economic spectrum at the whole plant level. Higher NH4+ and NO3- uptake abilities were associated with the resource-acquisitive strategy.\n\nNonetheless, NH4+ and NO3- uptake within species varied between land-uses and with sampling time, suggesting that LES and plant traits are good, but still incomplete, descriptors of plant functioning. Although the NH4+: NO3- uptake ratio was different between plant species in our study, they all showed a preference for NH4+, and particularly the most conservative species. Soil environmental variations between grasslands and sampling times may also drive to some extent the NH4+ and NO3- uptake ability of species. Our results support the current efforts to build a more general framework including above- and below-ground processes when studying plant community functioning.",

    "abstract": "The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is an important model organism for neuroscience with a wide array of genetic tools that enable the mapping of individuals neurons and neural subtypes. Brain templates are essential for comparative biological studies because they enable analyzing many individuals in a common reference space. Several central brain templates exist for Drosophila, but every one is either biased, uses sub-optimal tissue preparation, is imaged at low resolution, or does not account for artifacts. No publicly available Drosophila ventral nerve cord template currently exists. In this work, we created high-resolution templates of the Drosophila brain and ventral nerve cord using the best-available technologies for imaging, artifact correction, stitching, and template construction using groupwise registration. We evaluated our central brain template against the four most competitive, publicly available brain templates and demonstrate that ours enables more accurate registration with fewer local deformations in shorter time.",

    "abstract": "Non-genetic factors can cause individual cells to fluctuate substantially in gene expression levels over time. Yet it remains unclear whether these fluctuations can persist for much longer than the time of one cell division. Current methods for measuring gene expression in single cells mostly rely on single time point measurements, making the duration of gene expression fluctuations or cellular memory difficult to measure. Here, we report a method combining Luria and Delbrucks fluctuation analysis with population-based RNA sequencing (MemorySeq) for identifying genes transcriptome-wide whose fluctuations persist for several cell divisions. MemorySeq revealed multiple gene modules that are expressed together in rare cells within otherwise homogeneous clonal populations. Further, we found that these rare cell subpopulations are associated with biologically distinct behaviors, such as the ability to proliferate in the face of anti-cancer therapeutics, in different cancer cell lines. The identification of non-genetic, multigenerational fluctuations has the potential to reveal new forms of biological memory at the level of single cells and suggests that non-genetic heritability of cellular state may be a quantitative property.",

    "abstract": "Substitution rates in plant mitochondrial genes are extremely low, indicating strong selective pressure as well as efficient repair. Plant mitochondria possess base excision repair pathways, however, many repair pathways such as nucleotide excision repair and mismatch repair appear to be absent. In the absence of these pathways, many DNA lesions must be repaired by a different mechanism. To test the hypothesis that double-strand break repair (DSBR) is that mechanism, we maintained independent self-crossing lineages of plants deficient in uracil-N-glycosylase (UNG) for 11 generations to determine the repair outcomes when that pathway is missing. Surprisingly, no single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were fixed in any line in generation 11. The pattern of heteroplasmic SNPs was also unaltered through 11 generations. When the rate of cytosine deamination was increased by mitochondrial expression of the cytosine deaminase APOBEC3G, there was an increase in heteroplasmic SNPs, but only in mature leaves. Clearly DNA maintenance in reproductive meristem mitochondria is very effective in the absence of UNG, while mitochondrial genomes in differentiated tissue are maintained through a different mechanism, or not at all. Several genes involved in DSBR are upregulated in the absence of UNG, indicating that double strand break repair is a general system of repair in plant mitochondria. It is important to note that the developmental stage of tissues is critically important for these types of experiments.",

    "abstract": "Biopesticides based on Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) spores and toxins are alternate pest management solutions widely used to control insect pests. Their increasing use could lead to accumulation in the environment, hence leading to chronic exposure of non-target organisms. Here, we tested for potential non-intentional side-effects of chronic exposure to Bt biopesticide on larvae of non-target Drosophila species present in Bt-treated areas. Doses up to those recommended for field application (106 CFU/g of fly medium) had no effect on the fly development, whereas doses 10 to 100-fold higher (107-108 CFU/g) increased developmental time and decreased adult emergence rates in a dose-dependent manner and with varying effect amplitudes for all the species and strains tested. For all them, all larvae died before pupation at the highest dose tested (109 CFU/g). Focusing on D. melanogaster, delayed development and reduced emergence resulted from stage-dependent larval mortality, and fitness-related traits of adult flies emerging from surviving Bt biopesticide exposure were moderately increased. The effects of Bt biopesticide seemed to result from the spores/cleaved toxins synergy, and possibly additives. While recommended doses had no effect on non-target Drosophila species, misuse or local accumulation of Bt bioinsecticides in the environment could have non-intentional side-effects on fly populations with potential implications for their associated communities.",

    "abstract": "Local adaptation across species range is widespread. Yet, much has to be discovered on its environmental drivers, the underlying functional traits and their molecular determinants. Because elevation gradients display continuous environmental changes at a short geographical scale, they provide an exceptional opportunity to investigate these questions. Here, we used two common gardens to phenotype 1664 plants from 11 populations of annual teosintes. These populations were sampled across two elevation gradients in Mexico. Our results point to a syndrome of adaptation to altitude with the production of offspring that flowered earlier, produced less tillers, and larger, longer and heavier grains with increasing elevation. We genotyped these plants for 178 outlier single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which had been chosen because they displayed excess of allele differentiation and/or correlation with environmental variables in six populations with contrasted altitudes. A high proportion of outlier SNPs associated with the phenotypic variation of at least one trait. We tested phenotypic pairwise correlations between traits, and found that the higher the correlation, the greater the number of common associated SNPs. In addition, allele frequencies at 87 of the outlier SNPs correlated with an environmental component best summarized by altitudinal variation on a broad sample of 28 populations. Chromosomal inversions were enriched for both phenotypically-associated and environmentally-correlated SNPs. Altogether, our results are consistent with the set-up of an altitudinal syndrome promoted by local adaptation of teosinte populations in the face of gene flow. We showed that pleiotropy is pervasive and potentially has constrained the evolution of traits. Finally, we recovered variants underlying phenotypic variation at adaptive traits. Because elevation mimics climate change through space, these variants may be relevant for future maize breeding.\n\nAuthor summaryAcross their native range, species encounter a diversity of habitats promoting local adaptation of geographically distributed populations. While local adaptation is widespread, much has yet to be discovered about the conditions of its emergence, the targeted traits, their molecular determinants and the underlying ecological drivers. Here we employed a reverse ecology approach, combining phenotypes and genotypes, to mine the determinants of local adaptation of teosinte populations distributed along two steep altitudinal gradients in Mexico. Evaluation of 11 populations in two common gardens located at mid-elevation pointed to the set-up of an altitudinal syndrome, in spite of gene flow. We scanned genomes to identify loci with allele frequencies shifts along elevation. Interestingly, variation at these loci was commonly associated to variation of phenotypes. Because elevation mimics climate change through space, these variants may be relevant for future maize breeding.",

It is hypothesized that molecules capable of blocking formation of such protein aggregates might avert disease onset or delay disease progression. Here we report that Fas Apoptosis Inhibitory Molecule (FAIM) counteracts stress-induced loss of viability. We found that levels of ubiquitinated protein aggregates produced by cellular stress are much greater in FAIM-deficient cells and tissues. Moreover, in an in vitro cell-free system, FAIM specifically and directly prevents pathological protein aggregates without participation by other cellular elements, in particular the proteasomal and autophagic systems. Although this activity is similar to the function of heat shock proteins (HSPO_SCPLOWSC_SCPLOW), FAIM, which is highly conserved throughout evolution, bears no homology to any other protein, including HSPO_SCPLOWSC_SCPLOW. These results identify a new actor that protects cells against stress-induced loss of viability by preventing protein aggregates.",

Using sub-millimeter-resolution fMRI at 7T we resolved BOLD-response and activation patterns across cortical depth in early sensory cortices to auditory, visual and audiovisual stimuli under auditory or visual attention. In visual cortices, auditory stimulation induced widespread inhibition irrespective of attention, whereas auditory relative to visual attention suppressed mainly central visual field representations. In auditory cortices, visual stimulation suppressed activations, but amplified responses to concurrent auditory stimuli, in a patchy topography. Critically, multisensory interactions in auditory cortices were stronger in deeper laminae, while attentional influences were greatest at the surface. These distinct depth-dependent profiles suggest that multisensory and attentional mechanisms regulate sensory processing via partly distinct circuitries. Our findings are crucial for understanding how the brain regulates information flow across senses to interact with our complex multisensory world.",

    "abstract": "We describe the genome contents of six Protomyces spp. that are pathogenic within the typical host range of the genus and a novel Protomyces strain (SC29) that was previously isolated from the phylloplane of wild Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), an atypical or possible alternate host. Genome-wide phylogenetic analysis defined SC29 as a distinct Protomyces sp. Analysis of gene family expansions, gene retention, and gene loss patterns among these Protomyces spp. lead us to hypothesize that SC29 may have undergone a host jump. The role of phyllosphere residency in the lifecycle of Protomyces spp. was previously unknown. Genomic changes in SC29 and all other Protomyces spp. were consistent with adaptations to the plant phylloplane. As predicted by our analysis of its mating locus, SC29 did not cause disease on Arabidopsis as a single strain, but could persist in its phylloplane, while the closely related P. inouyei does not. SC29 treated Arabidopsis exhibited enhanced immunity against Botrytis cinerea infection, associated with activation of MAPK3/6, camalexin, and SA-signalling pathways. We conclude that SC29 is a novel Protomyces sp. able to survive in the Arabidopsis phylloplane and that phylloplane residency is an important element in the lifecycle of Protomyces spp.",

    "abstract": "Studying relationships among gene-products by gene expression profile analysis is a common approach in systems biology. Many studies have generalized the outcomes to the different levels of central dogma information flow and assumed correlation of transcript and protein expression levels. All these efforts partook in the current understanding of signaling network models and expanded the signaling databases. In fact, due to the unavailability or high-cost of the experiments, most of the studies do not usually look for direct interactions, and some parts of these networks are contradictory. Besides, it is now a standard step to accomplish enrichment analysis on biological annotations, to make claims about the potentially implicated biological pathways in any perturbation. Explicitly, upon identifying differentially expressed genes, they are spontaneously presumed the corresponding dysregulated pathways. Then, molecular mechanistic insights are proposed for disease etiology and drug discovery based on statistically enriched biological processes. In this study, using four common and comprehensive databases, we extracted all relevant gene expression data and all relationships among directly linked gene pairs. We aimed to evaluate the ratio of coherency or sign consistency between the expression level and the causal relationships among the gene pairs. We illustrated that the signaling network was not more consistent or coherent with the recorded expression profile compared to the random relationships. Finally, we provided the pieces of evidence and concluded that gene-product expression data, especially at the transcript level, are not reliable or at least insufficient to infer causal biological relationships among genes and in turn, describe cellular behavior.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHalobacterium sp. NRC-1 (NRC-1) is an extremely halophilic archaeon that is adapted to multiple stressors such as UV, ionizing radiation and arsenic exposure. We conducted experimental evolution of NRC-1 under acid stress. NRC-1 was serially cultured in CM+ medium modified by four conditions: optimal pH (pH 7.5), acid stress (pH 6.3), iron amendment (600 M ferrous sulfate, pH 7.5), and acid plus iron (pH 6.3, with 600 M ferrous sulfate). For each condition, four independent lineages of evolving populations were propagated. After 500 generations, 16 clones were isolated for phenotypic characterization and genomic sequencing.\n\nResultsGenome sequences of all 16 clones revealed 378 mutations, of which 90% were haloarchaeal insertion sequences (ISH) and ISH-mediated large deletions. This proportion of ISH events in NRC-1 was five-fold greater than that reported for comparable evolution of E. coli. One acid-evolved clone had increased fitness compared to the ancestral strain when cultured at low pH. Seven of eight acid-evolved clones had a mutation within or upstream of arcD, which encodes an arginine-ornithine antiporter; no non-acid adapted strains had arcD mutations. Mutations also affected the arcR regulator of arginine catabolism, which protects bacteria from acid stress by release of ammonia. Two acid-adapted strains shared a common mutation in bop, which encodes the bacteriorhodopsin light-driven proton pump. Unrelated to pH, one NRC-1 minichromosome (megaplasmid) pNRC100 had increased copy number, and we observed several mutations that eliminate gas vesicles and arsenic resistance. Thus, in the haloarchaeon NRC-1, as in bacteria, pH adaptation was associated with genes involved in arginine catabolism and proton transport.\n\nConclusionsOur study is among the first to report experimental evolution with multiple resequenced genomes of an archaeon. Haloarchaea are polyextremophiles capable of growth under environmental conditions such as concentrated NaCl and desiccation, but little is known about pH stress. Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 (NRC-1) is considered a model organism for the feasibility of microbial life in iron-rich brine on Mars. Interesting parallels appear between the molecular basis of pH adaptation in NRC-1 and in bacteria, particularly the acid-responsive arginine-ornithine system found in oral streptococci.",

    "abstract": "While acute stressors can be detrimental, environmental stress conditioning can improve performance. To test the hypothesis that physiological status is altered by stress conditioning, we subjected juvenile Pacific geoduck, Panopea generosa, to repeated exposures of elevated pCO2 in a commercial hatchery setting followed by a period in ambient common garden. Respiration rate and shell length were measured for juvenile geoduck periodically throughout short-term repeated reciprocal exposure periods in ambient (~550 {micro}atm) or elevated (~2400 {micro}atm) pCO2 treatments and in common, ambient conditions, five months after exposure. Short-term exposure periods comprised an initial 10-day exposure followed by 14 days in ambient before a secondary 6-day reciprocal exposure. The initial exposure to elevated pCO2 significantly reduced respiration rate by 25% relative to ambient conditions, but no effect on shell growth was detected. Following 14 days in common garden, ambient conditions, reciprocal exposure to elevated or ambient pCO2 did not alter juvenile respiration rates, indicating ability for metabolic recovery under subsequent conditions. Shell growth was negatively affected during the reciprocal treatment in both exposure histories, however clams exposed to the initial elevated pCO2 showed compensatory growth with 5.8% greater shell length (on average between the two secondary exposures) after five months in ambient conditions. Additionally, clams exposed to the secondary elevated pCO2 showed 52.4% increase in respiration rate after five months in ambient conditions. Early exposure to low pH appears to trigger carry-over effects suggesting bioenergetic re-allocation facilitates growth compensation. Life stage-specific exposures to stress can determine when it may be especially detrimental, or advantageous, to apply stress conditioning for commercial production of this long-lived burrowing clam.\n\nLay summaryCommercial shellfish hatcheries provide essential food security, but often production can be hampered by sensitivity of shellfish at early life stages. Repeated short-term exposures can increase tolerance and performance of the geoduck clam with implications for sustainable aquaculture.",

    "abstract": "Developing a thorough understanding of how ectotherm physiology adapts to different thermal environments is of crucial importance, especially in the face of global climate change. A key aspect of an organisms thermal performance curve--the relationship between fitness-related trait performance and temperature--is its thermal sensitivity, i.e., the rate at which trait values increase with temperature within its typically-experienced thermal range. For a given trait, the distribution of thermal sensitivities across species, often quantified as \"activation energy\" values, is typically right-skewed. Currently, the mechanisms that generate this distribution are unclear, with considerable debate about the role of thermodynamic constraints vs adaptive evolution. Here, using a phylogenetic comparative approach, we study the evolution of the thermal sensitivity of population growth rate across phytoplankton (Cyanobacteria and eukaryotic microalgae) and prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), two microbial groups that play a major role in the global carbon cycle. We find that thermal sensitivity across these groups is moderately phylogenetically heritable, and that its distribution is shaped by repeated evolutionary convergence throughout its parameter space. More precisely, we detect bursts of adaptive evolution in thermal sensitivity, increasing the amount of overlap among its distributions in different clades. We obtain qualitatively similar results from evolutionary analyses of the thermal sensitivities of two physiological rates underlying growth rate: net photosynthesis and respiration of plants. Furthermore, we find that these episodes of evolutionary convergence are consistent with two opposing forces: decrease in thermal sensitivity due to environmental fluctuations and increase due to adaptation to stable environments. Overall, our results indicate that adaptation can lead to large and relatively rapid shifts in thermal sensitivity, especially in microbes where rapid evolution can occur at short time scales. Thus, more attention needs to be paid to elucidating the implications of rapid evolution in organismal thermal sensitivity for ecosystem functioning.\n\nAuthor summaryChanges in environmental temperature influence the performance of biological traits (e.g., respiration rate) in ectotherms, with the relationship between trait performance and temperature (the \"thermal performance curve\") being single-peaked. Understanding how thermal performance curves adapt to different environments is important for predicting how organisms will be impacted by climate change. One key aspect of the shape of these curves is the thermal sensitivity near temperatures typically experienced by the species. Whether and how thermal sensitivity responds to different environments is a topic of active debate. To shed light on this, here we perform an evolutionary analysis of the thermal sensitivity of three key traits of prokaryotes, phytoplankton, and plants. We show that thermal sensitivity does not evolve in a gradual manner, but can differ considerably even between closely related species. This suggests that thermal sensitivity undergoes rapid adaptive evolution, which is further supported by our finding that thermal sensitivity varies weakly with latitude. We conclude that variation in thermal sensitivity arises partly from adaptation to environmental factors and that this may need to be accounted for in ecophysiological models.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the production, response, and genetics of signals used in mate choice can inform our understanding of the evolution of both intraspecific mate choice and reproductive isolation. Sex pheromones are important for courtship and mate choice in many insects, but we know relatively little of their role in butterflies. The butterfly Heliconius melpomene uses a complex blend of wing androconial compounds during courtship. Electroantennography in H. melpomene and its close relative H. cydno showed that responses to androconial extracts were not species-specific. Females of both species responded equally strongly to extracts of both species, suggesting conservation of peripheral nervous system elements across the two species. Individual blend components provoked little to no response, with the exception of octadecanal, a major component of the H. melpomene blend. Supplementing octadecanal on the wings of octadecanal-rich H. melpomene males led to an increase in the time until mating, demonstrating the bioactivity of octadecanal in Heliconius. Using quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, we identified a single locus on chromosome 20 responsible for 41% of the parental species difference in octadecanal production. This QTL does not overlap with any of the major wing color or mate choice loci, nor does it overlap with known regions of elevated or reduced FST. A set of 16 candidate fatty acid biosynthesis genes lies underneath the QTL. Pheromones in Heliconius carry information relevant for mate choice and are under simple genetic control, suggesting they could be important during speciation.",

    "abstract": "The rise of antibiotic resistance (AR) in clinical settings is one of the biggest modern global public health concerns. Therefore, the understanding of AR mechanisms, evolution and global distribution is a priority due to its impact on the treatment course and patient survivability. Besides all efforts in the elucidation of AR mechanisms in clinical strains, little is known about its prevalence and evolution in environmental uncultivable microorganisms. In this study, 293 metagenomic from the TARA Oceans project were used to detect and quantify environmental antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) using machine learning tools. After extensive manual curation, we show the global ocean ARG abundance, distribution, taxonomy, phylogeny and their potential to be horizontally transferred by plasmids or viruses and their correlation with environmental and geographical parameters. A total of 99,205 environmental ORFs were identified as potential ARGs. These ORFs belong to 560 ARG families that confer resistance to 26 antibiotic classes. 24,567 ORFs were found in contigs classified as plasmidial sequences, suggesting the importance of mobile genetic elements in the dynamics of ARGs transmission. Moreover, 4,804 contigs with more than 2 ARGs were found, including 2 plasmid-like contigs with 5 different ARGs, highlighting the potential presence of multi-resistant microorganisms in the natural ocean environment. This also raises the possibility of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between clinical and natural environments. The abundance of ARGs showed different patterns of distribution, with some classes being significantly more abundant in coastal biomes. Finally, we identified ARGs conferring resistance to some of the most relevant clinical antibiotics, revealing the presence of 15 ARGs from the recently discovered MCR-1 family with high abundance on Polar Biomes. Of these, 5 were assigned to the genus Psychrobacter, an opportunistic pathogen that can cause fatal infections in humans.

    "abstract": "Maturation timing is a pivotal life-history trait balancing probabilities between mortality and reproduction. Environmental vs. genetic contributions to traits associated with maturation initiation, such as growth and body condition, remain uncertain because of difficulties in determining causality. In Atlantic salmon, maturation timing associates with a large-effect locus around vgll3, but how this locus affects maturation remains unknown. We combined controlled breeding with common-garden experimentation at two temperatures and show that vgll3 effects on maturation of males express primarily via body condition, which we demonstrate in the males non-maturing female relatives, thus avoiding reverse causality. Between homozygous vgll3 genotypes, maturation probability differed several folds and female condition differed 2% in both temperature environments. Vgll3 effects explained 25 and 16% of maturation probability heritability and 15 and 6% of female condition heritability, in the warm and cold environment, respectively. Non-significant vgll3 effects on female length were antagonistic to those on condition but of equal proportional size. When controlling for vgll3 effects, genetic correlations changed antagonistically between both maturation and condition vs. growth, suggesting vgll3 as a resource-allocation locus. The results support large vgll3 maturation effects being mediated via environmentally stable body condition effects, enabling rapid co-evolution between the life-history traits.",

In this study, we utilize an in vitro human pluripotent stem cell-based (hPSC) model of corticogenesis to probe the effect of early, chronic alcohol exposure on the transcriptome of developing cortical neurons. We here identify a relatively limited number of significantly altered biological pathways, including regional patterning, cell-type specification, axon guidance and synaptic function. Significant upregulation of WNT signaling-related transcripts, to the exclusion of other secreted morphogens was also observed in alcohol exposed cultures. Lastly, an overall alcohol-associated shift towards an increased caudal profile, at the expense of rostral molecular identity was observed, representing a potentially previously underappreciated FASD phenotype.",

It is less clear how interactions of these processes lead to the behavioral adaptations that allow animals to cope with a changing environment. We showed that juvenile zebrafish can perform conditioned place avoidance learning, with an improving performance across development. Ablation of the dorsolateral habenula (dlHb), a brain region involved in associative learning and prediction of outcomes, led to an unexpected improvement in performance and delayed memory extinction. Interestingly, while the control animals exhibited rapid adaptation to a changing learning rule, dlHb ablated animals failed to adapt. Altogether, our results show that the dlHb plays a central role in switching animals strategies while integrating new evidence with prior experience.",

    "abstract": "Animals often communicate with each other in noisy environments where interference from the ambient noise and other signallers may reduce the effectiveness of signals. Signalling behaviours may also evolve to interfere with signals of their opponents, e.g. by temporally overlapping them with their own, such as the song overlapping behaviour that is seen in some songbirds during aggressive interactions. Song overlapping has been proposed to be a signal of aggressive intent, but few studies directly examined the association between song overlapping and aggressive behaviours of the overlapping bird (the predictive criterion). In the present paper we examined the question of whether song overlapping is correlated with aggressive behaviours displayed during a simulated territorial intrusion in a population of great tits (Parus major) living in an urban-rural gradient. We also examined whether aggressive behaviours are correlated with the ambient noise levels. We found that overlapping was associated negatively with aggressive behaviours males displayed against a simulated intruder. These results fail to support the predictive criterion for song overlapping, raising the question whether overlapping is in fact a signal of aggressive intent. Ambient noise levels were associated positively with aggressive behaviours but did not correlate with song rate, song duration or song overlapping. Great tits in noisy urban habitats may display higher levels of aggressive behaviours due to either interference of noise in aggressive communication or another indirect effect of noise.",

Club cell secretory protein-16 (CC-16) is associated with the clinical expression of COPD. We aimed to determine if there is a causal effect of serum CC-16 level on COPD risk and/or progression using Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis.\n\nMethodsWe performed a genome-wide association meta-analysis for serum CC-16 in two COPD cohorts (Lung Health Study [LHS], n=3,850 and ECLIPSE, n=1,702). We then used the CC-16-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MR analysis to estimate the causal effect of serum CC-16 on COPD risk (International COPD Genetics Consortium/UK-Biobank dataset; n=35,735 cases, n=222,076 controls) and progression (change in forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1] in LHS and ECLIPSE). We also determined the associations between SNPs associated with CC-16 and gene expression using n=1,111 lung tissue samples from the Lung eQTL Study.\n\nResultsWe identified 7 SNPs independently associated (p<5x10-8) with serum CC-16 levels; 6 of these were novel. MR analysis suggested a protective causal effect of increased serum CC-16 on COPD risk (p=0.008) and progression (LHS only, p=0.02). Five of the SNPs were also associated with gene expression in lung tissue, including that of the CC-16-encoding gene SCGB1A1 (false discovery rate<0.1).\n\nConclusionWe have identified several novel genetic variants associated with serum CC-16 level in COPD cohorts. These genetic associations suggest a potential causal effect of serum CC-16 on COPD risk and progression.

Employing transfer entropy (TE) to measure the amount of causal relationships between genes, TENET predicts large-scale gene regulatory cascades/relationships from scRNAseq data.

Specifically from scRNAseq, TENET identified key transcriptional factors in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and during direct cardiomyocytes reprogramming, where other predictors failed. We further demonstrate that known target genes have significantly higher TE values, and TENET predicted higher TE genes were more influenced by the perturbation of their regulator. Using TENET, we identified and validated that Nme2 is a culture condition specific stem cell factor. These results indicate that TENET is uniquely capable of identifying key regulators from scRNAseq data.\n\nKey PointsO_LITENET measures putative causal relationships between genes using transfer entropy.\nC_LIO_LITENET shows outstanding performance in identifying key regulators compared to existing methods.\nC_LIO_LITENET can reveal previously uncharacterized regulators.\nC_LI",

Using a series of benchmarks, we show the high accuracy of POEM, and demonstrate its use on a human gut metagenome sample. We conclude that POEM is a useful tool for analyzing metagenomes beyond the genomic level, and for identifying multi-gene functionalities and possible neofunctionalization in metagenomes.

    "abstract": "MR1-restricted T (MR1T) cells are defined by their recognition of metabolite antigens presented by the monomorphic MHC class 1-related molecule, MR1, the most highly conserved MHC class I related molecule in mammalian species. Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are the predominant subset of MR1T cells expressing an invariant TCR -chain, TRAV1-2. These cells comprise a T cell subset that recognizes and mediates host immune responses to a broad array of microbial pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Here, we sought to characterize development of circulating human MR1T cells as defined by MR1-5-OP-RU tetramer labelling and of the TRAV1-2+ MAIT cells defined by expression of TRAV1-2 and high expression of CD26 and CD161 (TRAV1-2+CD161++CD26++ cells). We analysed postnatal expansion, maturation and functionality of peripheral blood MR1-5-OP-RU tetramer+ MR1T cells in cohorts from three different geographic settings with different tuberculosis (TB) vaccination practices, levels of exposure to and infection with M. tuberculosis. Early after birth, frequencies of MR1-5-OP-RU tetramer+ MR1T cells increased rapidly by several fold. This coincided with the transition from a predominantly CD4+ and TRAV1-2- population in neonates, to a predominantly TRAV1-2+CD161++CD26++ CD8+ population. We also observed that tetramer+ MR1T cells that expressed TNF upon mycobacterial stimulation were very low in neonates, but increased [~]10-fold in the first year of life. These functional MR1T cells in all age groups were MR1-5-OP-RU tetramer+TRAV1-2+ and highly expressed CD161 and CD26, markers that appeared to signal phenotypic and functional maturation of this cell subset. This age-associated maturation was also marked by the loss of naive T cell markers on tetramer+ TRAV1-2+ MR1T cells more rapidly than tetramer+TRAV1-2- MR1T cells and non-MR1T cells. These data suggest that neonates have infrequent populations of MR1T cells with diverse phenotypic attributes; and that exposure to the environment rapidly and preferentially expands the MR1-5-OP-RU tetramer+TRAV1-2+ population of MR1T cells, which becomes the predominant population of functional MR1T cells early during childhood.",

    "abstract": "Atrophic age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common form of AMD accounting for 90% of patients. During atrophic AMD the waste/exchange pathway between the blood supply (choroid) and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is compromised. This results in atrophy and death of the RPE cells and subsequently the photoreceptors leading to central blindness. Although the mechanisms behind AMD are unknown, the growth of fatty deposits known as drusen, have been shown to play a role in the disease. There is currently no treatment or cure for atrophic AMD. Much research focuses on developing a synthetic substrate in order to transplant healthy cells to the native Bruchs membrane (BM), however, the diseased native BM and related structures still leave the potential for transplanted cells to succumb to disease. In this work we electrospun poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) to fabricate a nanofibrous cytocompatible synthetic BM. The apical surface of the membrane was cultured with ARPE-19 cells and the basal surface was decorated with poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) or poly(glycolic acid) (PGA) degradable nanoparticles by electrospraying. The membrane exhibited hydrophilicity, high tensile strength and structurally resembled the native BM. ARPE-19 cells were able to form a monolayer on the surface of the membrane and no cell invasion into the membrane was seen. The presence of both PLGA and PGA nanoparticles increased ARPE-19 cell metabolism but had no effect on cell viability. There was a decrease in pH of ARPE-19 cell culture media 7 days following culturing with the PLGA nanoparticles but this change was eliminated by 2 weeks; PGA nanoparticles had no effect on cell culture media pH. The fluorescent dye FITC was encapsulated into nanoparticles and showed sustained release from PLGA nanoparticles for two weeks and PGA nanoparticles for 1 day. Future work will focus on encapsulating biologically active moieties to target drusen. This would allow this novel bioactive substrate to be a potential treatment for atrophic AMD that would function two-fold: deliver the required monolayer of healthy RPE cells to the macula on a synthetic BM and remove diseased structures within the retina, restoring the waste/exchange pathway and preventing vision loss.",

    "abstract": "Read alignment is central to many aspects of modern genomics. Most aligners use heuristics to accelerate processing, but these heuristics can fail to find the optimal alignments of reads. Alignment accuracy is typically measured through simulated reads; however, the simulated location may not be the (only) location with the optimal alignment score. Vargas implements a heuristic-free algorithm guaranteed to find the highest-scoring alignment for real sequencing reads to a linear or graph genome. With semiglobal and local alignment modes and affine gap and quality-scaled mismatch penalties, it can implement the scoring functions of commonly used aligners to calculate optimal alignments. While this is computationally intensive, Vargas uses multi-core parallelization and vectorized (SIMD) instructions to make it practical to optimally align large numbers of reads, achieving a maximum speed of 456 billion cell updates per second. We demonstrate how these \"gold standard\" Vargas alignments can be used to improve heuristic alignment accuracy by optimizing command-line parameters in Bowtie 2, BWA-MEM, and vg to align more reads correctly.

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic trees inferred from sequence data often have branch lengths measured in the expected number of substitutions and therefore, do not have divergence times estimated. These trees give an incomplete view of evolutionary histories since many applications of phylogenies require time trees. Many methods have been developed to convert the inferred branch lengths from substitution unit to time unit using calibration points, but none is universally accepted as they are challenged in both scalability and accuracy under complex models. Here, we introduce a new method that formulates dating as a non-convex optimization problem where the variance of log-transformed rate multipliers are minimized across the tree. On simulated and real data, we show that our method, wLogDate, is often more accurate than alternatives and is more robust to various model assumptions.",

    "abstract": "E. coli SSB (EcSSB) is a model protein for studying functions of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding proteins (SSBs), which are critical in genome maintenance. EcSSB forms homotetramers that wrap ssDNA in multiple conformations in order to protect these transiently formed regions during processes such as replication and repair. Using optical tweezers, we measure the binding and wrapping of a single long ssDNA substrate under various conditions and free protein concentrations. We show that EcSSB binds in a biphasic manner, where initial wrapping events are followed by unwrapping events as protein density on the substrate passes a critical saturation. Increasing free EcSSB concentrations increase the fraction of EcSSBs in less-wrapped conformations, including a previously uncharacterized EcSSB8 bound state in which [~]8 nucleotides of ssDNA are bound by a single domain of the tetramer with minimal substrate deformation. When the ssDNA is over-saturated with EcSSB, stimulated dissociation rapidly removes excess EcSSB, leaving an array of stably-wrapped EcSSB-ssDNA complexes. We develop a multi-step kinetic model in which EcSSB tetramers transition through multiple wrapped conformations which are regulated through nearest neighbor interactions and ssDNA occupancy. These results provide a mechanism through which otherwise stably bound and wrapped EcSSB tetramers can be rapidly removed from an ssDNA substrate to allow for DNA maintenance and replication functions while still fully protecting ssDNA over a wide range of protein concentrations.",

Here we identify a pivotal role for DHX9 in homologous recombination (HR). Cells that are deficient in DHX9 are impaired in the generation of single stranded DNA (ssDNA) by DNA end resection. Consequently these cells fail to recruit RPA and RAD51 to sites of DNA damage and are hypersensitive to treatment with the DNA damaging agents camptothecin and Olaparib. A critical early step in the initiation of HR is the recruitment of BRCA1 mediator protein to DNA damage to promote DNA resection. We show here that recruitment of BRCA1 to DNA damage foci is dependent on its interaction with DHX9 to form the BRCA1-D complex, which binds to nascent RNA. Together our data identify a pivotal role for DHX9 in homologous recombination and highlight the important contribution of RNA in the recruitment of BRCA1 to DNA damage for the repair of DNA breaks",

    "abstract": "Pathological activation and collaboration of T and B cells underlies pathogenic autoantibody responses. Existing treatments for autoimmune disease cause non-specific immunosuppression and induction of antigen-specific tolerance remains an elusive goal. Many immunotherapies aim to manipulate the T-cell component of T-B interplay but few directly target B cells. One possible means to specifically target B cells is the transfer of gene-engineered BM that, once engrafted, gives rise to widespread specific and tolerogenic antigen expression within the hematopoietic system. Gene-engineered bone marrow encoding ubiquitous ovalbumin expression was transferred after low-dose (300cGy) immune-preserving irradiation. B-cell responsiveness was monitored by analyzing ovalbumin-specific antibody production after immunization with ovalbumin/complete Freunds adjuvant. Ovalbumin-specific B cells and their response to immunization were analyzed using multi-tetramer staining. When antigen-encoding bone marrow was transferred under immune-preserving conditions, cognate antigen-specific B cells were purged from the recipients pre-existing B cell repertoire as well as the repertoire that arose after bone marrow transfer. OVA-specific B-cell deletion was apparent within the established host B-cell repertoire as well as that developing after gene-engineered bone marrow transfer. OVA-specific antibody production was substantially inhibited by transfer of OVA-encoding BM and activation of OVA-specific B cells, germinal centre formation and subsequent OVA-specific plasmablast differentiation were all inhibited. Low levels of gene-engineered bone marrow chimerism were sufficient to limit antigen-specific antibody production. These data show that antigen-specific B cells within an established B-cell repertoire are susceptible to de novo tolerance induction and this can be achieved by transfer of gene-engineered bone marrow. This adds further dimensions to the utility of antigen-encoding bone marrow transfer as an immunotherapeutic tool.",

Here we present a biologically-informed computational framework that characterizes the functional relevance of all 1,107 published mutational hotspots identified in [~]25,000 tumor samples across 41 cancer types in the context of a human 3D interactome network, in which the interface of each interaction is mapped at residue resolution. Hotspots reside in network hub proteins and are enriched on protein interaction interfaces, suggesting that alteration of specific protein-protein interactions is critical for the oncogenicity of many hotspot mutations. Our framework enables, for the first time, systematic identification of specific protein interactions affected by hotspot mutations at the full proteome scale. Furthermore, by constructing a hotspot-affected network that connects all hotspot-affected interactions throughout the whole human interactome, we uncover genome-wide relationships among hotspots and implicate novel cancer proteins that do not harbor hotspot mutations themselves. Moreover, applying our network-based framework to specific cancer types identifies clinically significant hotspots that can be used for prognosis and therapy targets. Overall, we demonstrate that our framework bridges the gap between the statistical significance of mutational hotspots and their biological and clinical significance in human cancers.",

In vivo, defects in DNA must be rapidly and efficiently repaired to maintain cellular function and integrity. Defects can also alter the mechanical response of DNA to bending and twisting constraints, both of which are important in defining the mechanics of DNA supercoiling. Here, we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and supporting statistical-mechanical theory to study the effect of mismatched base pairs on DNA supercoiling. Our simulations show that plectoneme pinning at the mismatch site is deterministic under conditions of relatively high force (> 2 pN) and high salt concentration (> 0.5 M NaCl). Under physiologically relevant conditions of lower force (0.3 pN) and lower salt concentration (0.2 M NaCl), we find that plectoneme pinning becomes probabilistic and the pinning probability increases with the mismatch size. These findings are in line with experimental observations. The simulation framework, validated with experimental results and supported by the theoretical predictions, provides a way to study the effect of defects on DNA supercoiling and the dynamics of supercoiling in molecular detail.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlthough differentiated thyroid cancer has good prognosis, radioactive iodine (RAI) resistant thyroid cancer is difficult to treat. Current therapies for progressive RAI resistant thyroid cancer are not very effective. There is an unmet need for better therapeutic agents in this scenario. Studies have shown that aggressive thyroid cancers express matrix metalloproteinase -2 (MMP-2). Chlorotoxin is a selective MMP-2 agonist. Given that Saporin is a well-known ribosome-inactivating protein used for anti-cancer treatment, we hypothesized that Chlorotoxin-conjugated Saporin (CTX-SAP) would inhibit the growth of aggressive thyroid cancer cell lines expressing MMP-2.\n\nMethodsThe ML-1 thyroid cancer cell line was used for this study because it is known to express MMP-2. ML-1 cells were treated with a toxin consisting of biotinylated Chlorotoxin bonded with a secondary conjugate of Streptavidin-ZAP containing Saporin (CTX-SAP) from 0 to 600 nM for 72 hours. Then, cell viability was measured via XTT assay at an absorbance of A450-630. Control experiments were set up using Chlorotoxin and Saporin individually at the same varying concentrations.\n\nResultsAfter 7 hours of incubation, there was a statistically significant reduction in cell viability with increasing concentrations of the CTX-SAP conjugate (F=4.286, p=0.0057). In particular, the cell viability of ML-1 cells was decreased by 49.77% with the treatment of 600 nM of CTX-SAP (F=44.24), and the reduction in cell viability was statistically significant (Dunnetts test p<0.0001). In contrast, individual Chlorotoxin or Saporin in increasing concentrations had no significant effect on cell viability using similar assay.\n\nConclusionThis in vitro study demonstrated the efficacy of a CTX-SAP conjugate in reducing the viability of ML-1 thyroid cancer cells in a dose dependent manner. Further studies are needed to delineate the effectiveness of CTX-SAP in the treatment of aggressive thyroid cancer. Our study points towards MMP-2 as a potential target for RAI-resistant thyroid cancer.",

The sequence reads were 2.3 kb of mean length and provided an even coverage of the mitochondrial genome. Long-reads spanning half or more of the whole mtDNA provided a coverage that varied between 118X and 488X. Finally, we identified SNPs with a precision of 98.1%; recall of 85.2% and a F1-score of 0.912.\n\nConclusionsOur analyses show that our method to amplify mtDNA and to sequence it using the nanopore technology is usable for mitochondrial DNA variant analysis. With minor modifications, this approach could easily be applied to other large circular DNA molecules.",

Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to map hemocytes across different inflammatory conditions in larvae. We resolved plasmatocytes into different states based on the expression of genes involved in cell cycle, antimicrobial response, and metabolism together with the identification of intermediate states. Further, we discovered rare subsets within crystal cells and lamellocytes that express fibroblast growth factor (FGF) ligand branchless and receptor breathless, respectively. We demonstrate that these FGF components are required for mediating effective immune responses against parasitoid wasp eggs, highlighting a novel role for FGF signaling in inter-hemocyte crosstalk.

We used a macaque model of spontaneous control of SIVmac251 infection to monitor the development and evolution of potent antiviral CD8+ T-cell responses. SIV-specific CD8+ T-cells emerged during primary infection in all animals. However, the ability of CD8+ T cells to suppress SIV replication was low in early stages but increased after a period of maturation, temporally linked with the establishment of sustained low-level viremia in controller macaques. SIV-specific CD8+ T-cells with a central memory phenotype expressed higher levels of survival markers in controllers versus non-controllers. In contrast, a persistently skewed differentiation phenotype was observed among central memory SIV-specific CD8+ T-cells in non-controllers since primary infection, typified by relatively high expression levels of T-bet.\n\nCollectively, these data show that the phenotype of SIV-specific CD8+ T-cells defined early after SIV infection favor the gain of antiviral potency as a function of time in controllers, whereas SIV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in non-controllers fail to gain antiviral potency due to early defects imprinted in the central memory pool.",

    "abstract": "Many organisms harbour circadian clocks that promote their adaptation to the rhythmic environment. While a broad knowledge of the molecular mechanism of circadian clocks has been gained through the fungal model Neurospora crassa, little is known about circadian clocks in other fungi. N. crassa belongs to the same class as many important plant pathogens including the vascular wilt fungus Verticillium dahliae. We identified homologues of N. crassa clock proteins in V. dahliae, which showed high conservation in key protein domains. However, no evidence for an endogenous, free-running and entrainable rhythm was observed in the daily formation of conidia and microsclerotia. In N. crassa the frequency (frq) gene encodes a central clock protein expressed rhythmically and in response to light. In contrast, expression of Vdfrq is not light-regulated. Temporal gene expression profiling over 48 hours in constant darkness and temperature revealed no circadian expression of key clock genes. Furthermore, RNA-seq over a 24 h time-course revealed no robust oscillations of RNA in constant darkness. Comparison of gene expression between wild-type V. dahliae and a{Delta} Vdfrq mutant showed that genes involved in metabolism, transport and redox processes are mis-regulated in the absence of Vdfrq. In addition, Vd{Delta}frq mutants display growth defects and reduced pathogenicity in a strain dependent manner. Our data indicate that if a circadian clock exists in Verticillium, it is based on alternative mechanisms such as post-transcriptional interactions of VdFRQ and the WC proteins or the components of a FRQ-less oscillator. Alternatively, it could be that whilst the original functions of the clock proteins have been maintained, in this species the interactions that generate rhythmicity have been lost or are only triggered when specific environmental conditions are met. The presence of conserved clock genes in genomes should not be taken as definitive evidence of circadian function.\n\nAuthor summaryCircadian clocks are used by organisms to orchestrate the activity of cellular processes such that they occur at an optimal time of day. Research carried out in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa has revealed a huge amount of information about the components its circadian clock, its interactions with the environment and how it drives cellular biochemistry and physiology. Although homologues of the Neurospora clock genes are present in a number of fungi, functional clocks have been demonstrated in a just a handful. Importantly, a link between the circadian clock of the plant pathogen Botrytis cinerea and virulence has recently been reported. We report that another significant plant pathogen, Verticillium dahliae, contains well-conserved homologues of all key clock genes. We find that diurnal development of conidia and microsclerotia is not influenced by a circadian clock. Furthermore, in a constant environment we find no evidence of rhythmic transcript accumulation. However, deletion of the central clock component results in altered growth and reduced virulence. This led us to question the role of clock genes in Verticillium. We are forced to consider that in this species the interactions that generate rhythmicity have been lost, are generated purely via post-transcriptional modification of clock proteins, are only triggered when specific environmental conditions are met or never evolved.",

    "abstract": "One-Health studies applying massive-parallel and single-molecule sequencing are a suitable approximation to try to understand how antibiotic resistances flow between the human-animal-environment scenario. Colistin has been withdrawn in human medicine due to its toxicity, limiting its usage as a last-resort treatment option for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. However, it is still used orally to treat Enterobacteriaceae infections in veterinary medicine. Since 2015, colistin resistance appeared to be located in mobile genetic elements, raising the concern of the likelihood of transmission by horizontal gene transfer between animals and humans. In this study, 202 faecal samples were collected in a mixed farm from pigs, calves, and the farmer. PCR for the mcr-1 gene was positive for 18 of the isolates, and Nanopore sequencing allowed us to determine the location of the gene, either on the chromosome or in plasmids. Three types of replicons were found within the positive isolates harbouring the mcr-1: IncX4, IncI2, and IncHI2. Four different genetic contexts probably indicate different stages of gene stabilization, either in the chromosome or plasmid, with ISApl1 as the main insertion element flanking the gene. Moreover, 43 other resistance genes were found in our samples, related to more than six different antibiotic families (e.g. aminoglycosides, lincosamides, beta-lactams, macrolides, trimethoprim, phenicols, and sulphonamides). We found resistance genes against colistin and that six antibiotic families together in at least one of the isolates from human, swine, and bovine. Isolate 15B-22 harboured one plasmid with seven resistance genes related to four families of antibiotics other than polymyxins, meaning that there are more chances to maintain colistin resistance even with the withdrawn of colistin. Nanopore long reads allowed us to assemble the DNA elements within the isolates easily and determine the genetic context of the mcr-1 gene. Furthermore, they allowed us to describe and locate more antimicrobial resistance genes to other antibiotic families and antiseptic compounds.",

    "abstract": "tRNA-derived small fragments (tRFs) and tRNA halves have emerging functions in different biological pathways, such as regulating gene expression, protein translation, retrotransposon activity, transgenerational epigenetic changes and response to environmental stress. However, small RNAs like tRFs and microRNAs in the maternal-fetal interface during gestation have not been studied extensively. Here we investigated the small RNA composition of mouse placenta/decidua, which represents the interface where the mother communicates with the fetus, to determine whether there are specific differences in tRFs and microRNAs during fetal development and in response to maternal immune activation (MIA). Global tRF expression pattern, just like microRNAs, can distinguish tissue types among placenta/decidua, fetal brain and fetal liver. In particular, 5 tRNA halves from tRNAGly, tRNAGlu, tRNAVal and tRNALys are abundantly expressed in the normal mouse placenta/decidua. Moreover, tRF and microRNA levels in the maternal-fetal-interface change dynamically over the course of embryonic development. To see if stress alters non-coding RNA expression at the maternal-fetal interface, we treated pregnant mice with a viral infection mimetic, which has been shown to promote autism-related phenotypes in the offspring. Acute changes in the levels of specific tRFs and microRNAs were observed 3-6 hours after MIA and are suppressed thereafter. A group of 5 tRNA halves is down-regulated by MIA, whereas a group of 18-nucleotide tRF-3a is up-regulated. In conclusion, tRFs show tissue-specificity, developmental changes and acute response to environmental stress, opening the possibility of them having a role in the fetal response to MIA.",

    "abstract": "Activation of T cells requires a global surge in cellular protein synthesis, accompanied by a large increase in translation initiation1-4. A central component of the translation initiation machinery-the multi-subunit eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3)-is rapidly turned on when quiescent T cells are stimulated3. However, the precise role eIF3 plays in activated T cells is not known. Using a global transcriptome crosslinking approach, we show human eIF3 interacts with a distinct set of mRNAs in activated Jurkat cells. A subset of these mRNAs, including those encoding the T cell receptor (TCR) subunits TCRA and TCRB, crosslink to eIF3 across the entire length of the mRNA. The TCRA and TCRB mRNAs do not co-localize with translationally repressed environments of P-bodies or stress granules but form distinct granules, potentially acting as translation \"hot-spots.\" T cell activation through CD28 causes a burst of TCR translation controlled by elements in the 3-untranslated regions (3-UTRs) of the TCRA and TCRB mRNAs that directly contact eIF3 and that are required for T cell activity. These results highlight a new role for eIF3 in regulating the translation dynamics of the TCR and provide insights that can guide the engineering of T cells used in cell immunotherapy applications.",

    "abstract": "Tools enabling closed-loop experiments are crucial to delineate causal relationships between the activity of genetically-labeled neurons and specific behaviors. We developed the Raspberry Pi Virtual Reality system (PiVR) to conduct closed-loop optogenetic stimulation of neural functions in unrestrained animals. PiVR is an experimental platform that operates at high-temporal resolution (>50 Hz) with low latencies (~10 ms), while being affordable (<$500) and easy to build (<6 hours). This tool was designed to be accessible to a wide public, from highschool students to professional researchers studying systems neuroscience. We illustrate the functionality of PiVR by focusing on sensory navigation in response to gradients of chemicals (chemotaxis) and light (phototaxis). We show how Drosophila flies perform negative chemotaxis by modulating their locomotor speed to avoid locations associated with optogenetically-evoked bitter taste. In Drosophila larvae, we use innate positive chemotaxis to compare orientation behavior elicited by real- and virtual-odor gradients with static shapes as well as by turbulent virtual-odor plumes. Finally, we examine how positive phototaxis emerges in zebrafish larvae from the modulation of turning maneuvers during the ascent of virtual white-light gradients. Besides its application to study chemotaxis and phototaxis, PiVR is a versatile tool designed to bolster efforts to map and to functionally characterize neural circuits.",

    "abstract": "Recent meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies identified a number of genetic risk factors of Alzheimers disease; however, little is known about the mechanisms by which they contribute to the pathological process. As synapse loss is observed at the earliest stage of Alzheimers disease, deciphering the impact of Alzheimers risk genes on synapse formation and maintenance is of great interest. In this paper, we report a microfluidic co-culture device that physically isolates synapses from pre- and postsynaptic neurons and chronically exposes them to toxic amyloid-beta (A{beta}) peptides secreted by model cell lines overexpressing wild-type or mutated (V717I) amyloid precursor protein (APP). Co-culture with cells overexpressing mutated APP exposed the synapses of primary hippocampal neurons to A{beta}1-42 molecules at nanomolar concentrations and induced a significant decrease in synaptic connectivity, as evidenced by distance-based assignment of postsynaptic puncta to presynaptic puncta. Treating the cells with antibodies that target different forms of A{beta} suggested that low molecular weight oligomers are the likely culprit. As proof of concept, we demonstrate that overexpression of protein tyrosine kinase 2 beta (Pyk2) -an Alzheimers disease genetic risk factor involved in synaptic plasticity and shown to decrease in Alzheimers disease brains at gene expression and protein levels-selectively in postsynaptic neurons is protective against A{beta}1-42-induced synaptotoxicity. In summary, our lab-on-a-chip device provides a physiologically-relevant model of Alzheimers disease-related synaptotoxicity, optimal for assessing the impact of risk genes in pre- and postsynaptic compartments.",

The regulation of these behaviors has been largely ascribed to the monoaminergic system in limbic regions. However, the contribution of cerebellar dopamine signaling in the modulation of these functions remains largely unknown due to the lack of precise characterization of cerebellar dopaminoceptive neurons. By combining cell type-specific transcriptomic and histological analyses, 3D imaging and electrophysiology we demonstrate that cerebellar dopamine D2 receptors (D2R) in mice are preferentially expressed in Purkinje cells (PCs). While activation of D2R regulate synaptic efficacy onto PCs, their deletion or overexpression in PCs bidirectionally controls preference for social novelty without affecting motor functions. Altogether, these findings demonstrate novel D2Rs roles in PC function and causally link cerebellar D2R levels of expression to social behaviors.",

Larger area of stigma, and shorter length of anthers, filaments and petals were observed in plants subjected to heat stress compared to those under controlled conditions. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation showed that length of stigmatic papillae without pollens seemed to be longer than that with pollens. In addition, classification of stigmas based on pollen attachment patterns together with artificial pollination assay revealed that pollen attachment onto stigma was clearly decreased by heat stress, and indicated that heat induced elongation of stigmatic papillae might be associated with disturbance of pollen attachment onto stigma. Furthermore, histochemical staining experiments revealed that crosstalk between Ca2+ and NO derived from pollens and O2- derived from stigma might be associated with morphological alteration of stigma.",

    "abstract": "SummaryGrafting techniques have been applied in studies of systemic, long-distance signaling in several model plants. Seedling grafting in Arabidopsis, known as micrografting, enables investigation of the molecular mechanisms of systemic signaling between shoots and roots. However, conventional micrografting requires a high level of skill, limiting its use. Thus, an easier user-friendly method is needed. Here, we developed a silicone microscaled device, the micrografting chip, to obviate the need for training and to generate less stressed and more uniformly grafted seedlings. The chip has tandemly arrayed units, each of which consists of a seed pocket for seed germination and a micro-path with pairs of pillars for hypocotyl holding. Grafting, including seed germination, micrografting manipulation, and establishment of tissue reunion, is performed on the chip. Using the micrografting chip, we evaluated the effect of temperature and the carbon source on grafting and showed that a temperature of 27{degrees}C and a sucrose concentration of 0.5% were optimal. We also used the chip to investigate the mechanism of systemic signaling of iron status using a quadruple nicotianamine synthase (nas) mutant. The constitutive iron-deficiency response in the nas mutant because of aberrant partitioning was significantly rescued by grafting of wild-type shoots or roots, suggesting that shoot-and root-ward translocation of nicotianamine-iron complexes is essential for iron mobilization. Thus, our micrografting chip will promote studies of long-distance signaling in plants.\n\nSignificance StatementA number of micrografting studies on systemic, long-distance signaling have been performed, but the technique is not yet used widely. Here, we developed a silicone-based micrografting chip to improve the ease-of-use, efficiency, and success rate of micrografting, even for untrained users.",

    "abstract": "Crosses between the wild tomato species Solanum peruvianum and S. chilense result in hybrid seed failure (HSF), characterized by endosperm misdevelopment and embryo arrest. We previously showed that genomic imprinting, the parent-of-origin-dependent expression of alleles, is perturbed in hybrid endosperm, with many of the normally paternally expressed genes losing their imprinted status. Here, we report transcriptome-based analyses of gene and small RNA expression levels. We identified 2,295 genes and 468 small RNAs (sRNAs) as differentially expressed (DE) when comparing reciprocal hybrid seed to seeds and endosperms from the two within-species crosses. Our analyses uncovered a pattern of overdominance in endosperm gene expression in both cross directions, in marked contrast to the patterns of sRNA expression in whole seeds. Intriguingly, patterns of increased gene expression resembled the previously reported increased maternal expression proportions in hybrid endosperms. We identified physical clusters of sRNAs; DE sRNAs exhibited reduced levels of expression in hybrid seeds from both cross directions. Moreover, sRNAs mapped to genes coding for key proteins involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression, suggesting a regulatory feedback mechanism. We describe examples of genes that are targets of sRNA-mediated gene silencing; in these cases, reduced sRNA expression was concomitant with increased gene expression in hybrid seeds. Our analyses also show that S. peruvianum dominance impacts gene and sRNA expression in hybrid seeds. Overall, our study indicates roles for sRNA-mediated epigenetic regulation in HSF between closely related wild tomato species.",

    "abstract": "Human epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs) can coordinate both immunogenic and tolerogenic immune responses, creating an attractive opportunity for immunomodulation strategies. To investigate transcriptional determinants of human primary LC tolerance we applied single cells RNA-sequencing combined with transcriptional network modelling and functional analysis. Unsupervised clustering of single cell transcriptomes revealed that steady-state LCs exist in immature and immunocompetent states, and become fully immunocompetent on migration. Interestingly, LC migration, which has been shown to result in upregulation of the transcription factor IRF4, led in parallel to increased expression of a tolerogenic gene module including IDO1, LGALS1, LAMTOR1 and IL10RA, which translated to efficient induction of regulatory T cells in co-culture assays by immunocompetent LCs. Using protein expression analysis and perturbation with inhibitors, we confirmed the role of IDO1 as a mediator of LC tolerogenic responses induced during LC migration. Computational analysis of regulons and Partial Information Decomposition analyses identified IRF4 as a key driver for LC tolerogenic programmes. The predicted IRF4-regulated genes were confirmed by analysis of CRISPR-Cas9 edited LCs. These findings suggest that efficient priming of tolerogenic responses by LCs requires upregulation of a migration-coupled maturation program which is superimposed with a tolerance-inducing genomic module.",

    "abstract": "The growth of single-particle cryo-EM into a mainstream structural biology tool has allowed for many important biological discoveries. Continued developments in data collection strategies alongside new sample preparation devices heralds a future where users will collect multiple datasets per microscope session. To make cryo-EM data processing more automatic and user-friendly, we have developed an automatic pipeline for cryo-EM data preprocessing and assessment using a combination of deep learning and image analysis tools. We have verified the performance of this pipeline on a number of datasets and extended its scope to include sample screening by the user-free assessment of the qualities of a series of datasets under different conditions. We propose that our workflow provides a decision-free solution for cryo-EM, making data preprocessing more generalized and robust in the high-throughput era as well as more convenient for users from a range of backgrounds.",

    "abstract": "Vaginal fistula is a shattering maternal complication characterized by an anomalous opening between the bladder and/or rectum and vagina resulting in continuous leakage of urine or stool. Although prevalent in Ethiopia, its magnitude and distribution is not well studied. We used statistical mapping models using 2005 and 2016 Ethiopia Demographic Health Surveys data combined with a suite of potential risk factors to estimate the burden of vaginal fistula among women of childbearing age. The estimated number of women of childbearing age with lifetime and untreated vaginal fistula in 2016 were 72,533 (95% CI 38,235-124,103) and 31,961 (95% CI 11,596-70,309) respectively. These figures show reduction from the 2005 estimates: 98,098 (95% CI 49,819-170,737) lifetime and 59,114 (95% CI 26,580-118,158) untreated cases of vaginal fistula. The number of districts having more than 200 untreated cases declined drastically from 54 in 2005 to 6 in 2016. Our results show a significant subnational variation in the burden of vaginal fistula. Overall, between 2005 and 2016 there was substantial reduction in the prevalence of vaginal fistula in Ethiopia. Our results help guide local level tracking, planning, spatial targeting of resources and implementation of interventions against vaginal fistula.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe rise of the Asian chestnut gall wasp Dryocosmus kuriphilus in France has benefited the native community of parasitoids originally associated with oak gall wasps by becoming an additional trophic subsidy and therefore perturbing population dynamics of local parasitoids. However, the successful biological control of this pest has then led to significant decreases in its population densities. Here we investigate how the invasion of the Asian chestnut gall wasp Dryocosmus kuriphilus in France and its subsequent control by the exotic parasitoid Torymus sinensis has impacted the local community of native parasitoids.\n\nWe explored 5 years of native community dynamics within 26 locations during the rise and fall of the invasive pest. In an attempt to understand how mechanisms such as local extinction or competition come into play, we analyzed how the patterns of co-occurrence between the different native parasitoid species changed through time.\n\nOur results demonstrate that native parasitoid communities experienced increased competition as the D. kuriphilus levels of infestation decreased. During the last year of the survey, two alternative patterns were observed depending on the sampled location: either native parasitoid communities were represented by an extremely limited number of species occurring at low densities, in some cases no native parasitoid species at all, or they were dominated by one main parasitoid: Mesopolobus sericeus. These two patterns seemed to correlate with the habitat type, M. sericeus being more abundant in semi-natural habitats compared to agricultural lands, the former known to be natural reservoirs for native parasitoids. These results highlight how the \"boom-and-bust\" dynamics of an invasive pest followed by successful biological control can deeply alter the structure of native communities of natural enemies.\n\nThis article has been peer-reviewed and recommended by Peer Community in Zoology https://doi.org/10.24072/pci.zool.100004",

    "abstract": "The explosion in population genomic data demands ever more complex modes of analysis, and increasingly these analyses depend on sophisticated simulations. Recent advances in population genetic simulation have made it possible to simulate large and complex models, but specifying such models for a particular simulation engine remains a difficult and error-prone task. Computational genetics researchers currently re-implement simulation models independently, leading to inconsistency and duplication of effort. This situation presents a major barrier to empirical researchers seeking to use simulations for power analyses of upcoming studies or sanity checks on existing genomic data. Population genetics, as a field, also lacks standard benchmarks by which new tools for inference might be measured. Here we describe a new resource, stdpopsim, that attempts to rectify this situation. Stdpopsim is a community-driven open source project, which provides easy access to a growing catalog of published simulation models from a range of organisms and supports multiple simulation engine backends. This resource is available as a well-documented python library with a simple command-line interface. We share some examples demonstrating how stdpopsim can be used to systematically compare demographic inference methods, and we encourage a broader community of developers to contribute to this growing resource.",

    "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex inflammatory disease mediated by autoreactive antibodies that damages multiple tissues in children and adults. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have statistically implicated hundreds of loci in the susceptibility to human disease, including SLE, but the majority have failed to identify the causal variants or the effector genes. As a physicochemical approach to detecting functional variants and connecting them to target genes, we generated comprehensive, high-resolution maps of SLE variant accessibility and gene connectivity in the context of the three-dimensional chromosomal architecture of human tonsillar follicular helper T cells (TFH), a cell type required for the production of anti-nuclear antibodies characteristic of SLE. These spatial epigenomic maps identified a shortlist of over 400 potentially functional variants across 48 GWAS-implicated SLE loci. Twenty percent of these variants were located in open promoters of highly-expressed TFH genes, while 80% reside in non-promoter genomic regions that are connected in 3D to genes that likewise tend to be highly expressed in TFH. Importantly, we find that 90% of SLE-associated variants exhibit spatial proximity to genes that are not nearby in the 1D sequence of the genome, and over 60% of variants  skip the nearest gene to physically interact only with the promoters of distant genes. Gene ontology confirmed that genes in spatial proximity to SLE variants reside in highly SLE-relevant networks, including accessible variants that loop 200-1000 kb to interact with the promoters of the canonical TFH genes BCL6 and CXCR5. CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing confirmed that these variants reside in novel, distal regulatory elements required for normal BCL6 and CXCR5 expression by T cells. Furthermore, SLE-associated SNP-promoter interactomes implicated a set of novel genes with no known role in TFH or SLE disease biology, including the homeobox-interacting protein kinase HIPK1 and the Ste kinase homolog MINK1. Targeting these kinases in primary human TFH cells inhibited production of IL-21, a requisite cytokine for production of class-switched antibodies by B cells. This 3D-variant-to-gene mapping approach gives mechanistic insight into the SLE-associated regulatory architecture of the human genome.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is characterised by A{beta} and tau pathology as well as synaptic degeneration. Recently, it was suggested that the development of these key disease features may at least in part be due to increased protein synthesis that is regulated by fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and its binding partner CYFIP2. Using an unbiased screen, we show that exposure of primary neurons to A{beta} increases FMRP-regulated protein synthesis and involves a reduction of CYFIP2 levels. Modelling this CYFIP2 reduction in mice, we find A{beta} accumulation, development of pre-tangle tau pathology, gliosis, loss of synapses, and deficits in memory formation with ageing. We conclude that reducing endogenous CYFIP2 expression is sufficient to cause some key features of AD in mice. We therefore propose a central role for CYFIP2 in AD as a modulator of protein synthesis, highlighting a novel direction for therapeutic targeting.",
