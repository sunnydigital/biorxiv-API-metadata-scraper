    "abstract": "The Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) pathway initiates potent immune responses upon recognition of DNA derived from bacteria, viruses and tumors. To signal, the C-terminal tail (CTT) of STING recruits TBK1, a kinase that phosphorylates serine 365 (S365) in the CTT. Phospho-S365 acts as a docking site for IRF3, a transcription factor that is phosphorylated and activated by TBK1, leading to transcriptional induction of type I interferons (IFNs). IFNs are essential for antiviral immunity and are widely viewed as the primary output of STING signaling in mammals. However, other more evolutionarily ancestral responses, such as induction of NF-{kappa}B or autophagy, also occur downstream of STING. The relative importance of the various outputs of STING signaling during in vivo infections is unclear. Here we report that mice harboring a serine 365-to-alanine (S365A) point mutation in STING exhibit normal susceptibility to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection but, unexpectedly, are resistant to Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)-1, despite lacking STING-induced type I IFN responses. Likewise, we find Irf3-/- mice exhibit resistance to HSV-1. By contrast, resistance to HSV-1 is abolished in mice lacking the STING CTT or TBK1, suggesting that STING protects against HSV-1 upon TBK1 recruitment by the STING CTT, independent of IRF3 or type I IFNs. Interestingly, we find that STING-induced autophagy is a TBK1-dependent IRF3-independent process that is conserved in the STING S365A mice, and autophagy has previously been shown to be required for resistance to HSV-1. We thus propose that autophagy and perhaps other ancestral interferon-independent functions of STING are required for STING-dependent antiviral responses in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Legionella pneumophila (Lp) is a water borne bacterium causing Legionnaires Disease (LD) in humans. Rapid detection of Lp in water system is essential to reduce the risk of LD outbreaks. The methods currently available require expert skills and are time intensive, thus delaying intervention. In situ detection of Lp by biosensor would allow rapid implementation of control strategies. To this end, a biorecognition element is required. Aptamers are considered promising biorecognition molecules for biosensing. Aptamers are short oligonucleotide sequence folding into a specific structure and are able to bind to specific molecules. Currently no aptamer and thus no aptamer-based technology exists for the detection of Lp. In this study, Systemic Evolution of Ligands through EXponential enrichment (SELEX) was used to identify aptamers binding specifically to Lp. Ten rounds of positive selection and two rounds of counter-selection against two Pseudomonas species were performed. Two aptamers binding strongly to Lp were identified with KD of 116 and 135 nM. Binding specificity of these two aptamers to Lp was confirmed by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Therefore, these two aptamers are promising biorecognition molecules for the detection of Lp in water systems.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic factors related to early life adversity (ELA) in childhood are major risk factors for borderline intellectual functioning (BIF). BIF affects both adaptive and intellectual abilities, commonly leading to school failure and to an increased risk to develop mental and social problems in the adulthood. This study aimed to investigate the neurobiological underpinnings of ELA associated with BIF in terms of global topological organization and structural connectivity and their relation with intellectual functioning.\n\nBIF (N=32) and age-matched typical development (TD, N=14) children were evaluated for intelligence quotient (IQ), behavioral competencies, and ELA. Children underwent an anatomical and diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) protocol. Global brain topological organization was assessed measuring segregation and integration indexes. Moreover, structural matrices, measuring normalized number of fibers (NFn), were compared between the 2 groups using network-based statistics. Finally, a linear regression model was used to explore the relationship between network parameters and clinical measures.\n\nResults showed increased behavioral difficulties and ELA, together with decreased network integration in BIF children. Moreover, significantly lower NFn was observed in the BIF group (p=.039) in a sub-network comprising anterior and posterior cingulate, the pericallosal sulcus, the orbital frontal areas, amygdala, basal ganglia, the accumbens nucleus, and the hippocampus. Linear regression showed that NFn significantly predicted IQ (p<.0001).\n\nThis study demonstrated that ELA in children with BIF is associated with a decreased information integration at the global level, and with an altered structural connectivity within the limbic system strictly related to the intellectual functioning.",

    "abstract": "Spatial attention can be oriented endogenously, based on current task goals, or exogenously, triggered by salient events in the environment. Based upon literature demonstrating differences in the time course and neural substrates of each type of orienting, these two attention systems are often treated as fundamentally distinct. However, recent studies suggest that rhythmic neural activity in the alpha band (8-13Hz) and slow waves in the event-related potential (ERP) may emerge over parietal-occipital cortex following both endogenous and exogenous attention cues. To assess whether these neural changes index common processes of spatial attention, we conducted two within-subject experiments varying the two main dimensions over which endogenous and exogenous attention tasks typically differ: cue informativity (spatially predictive vs. non-predictive) and cue format (centrally vs. peripherally presented). This task design allowed us to tease apart neural changes related to top-down goals and those driven by the reflexive orienting of spatial attention, as well as examine their interactions in a novel hybrid cross-modal attention task. Our data demonstrate that both central and peripheral cues elicit lateralized ERPs over parietal-occipital cortex, though at different points in time, consistent with these ERPs reflecting the orienting of spatial attention. Lateralized alpha activity was also present across all tasks, emerging rapidly for peripheral cues and sustaining only for spatially informative cues. Overall, these data indicate that distinct slow-wave ERPs index the spatial orienting of endogenous and exogenous attention, while lateralized alpha activity represents a common signature of visual enhancement in anticipation of potential targets across both types of attention.",

While visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) are implicated in the development of metabolic syndrome, the adipose depot-specific effects of prenatal BPA treatment are poorly understood.\n\nObjectiveTo determine the impact of prenatal BPA exposure on the transcriptome of VAT and SAT adipose depots.\n\nMethodsRNA sequencing was performed on SAT and VAT from 21-month old control and prenatal BPA-treated female sheep. Differences in transcriptional profiling of SAT and VAT in controls and the effect of prenatal BPA treatment on individual genes and gene pathways were determined.\n\nResultsThere were 179 differentially expressed genes (padjusted<0.05, log2-fold change >2.5) between SAT and VAT. Development and immune response pathways were upregulated in SAT, while metabolic pathways were upregulated in VAT. In SAT, BPA-treatment resulted in differential expression of 108 genes (78% upregulated with BPA) and altered pathways (immune response downregulated, RNA processing upregulated). In contrast in VAT, BPA-treatment differentially expressed 4 genes and upregulated chromatin and RNA processing pathways.\n\nConclusionPrenatal BPA-treatment induces adult depot-specific alterations in RNA expression in inflammation, RNA processing, and chromatin, reflecting the diverse roles of SAT and VAT in regulating lipid storage and insulin sensitivity. These adipose tissue transcriptional dysregulations may contribute to the metabolic disorders observed in prenatal BPA-treated female sheep.",

    "abstract": "Addressing the looming global food security crisis requires the development of high yielding crops. In this regard, the deficiency for the micronutrient copper in agricultural soils decreases grain yield and significantly impacts a globally important crop, wheat. In cereals, grain yield is determined by inflorescence architecture, flower fertility, grain size and weight. Whether copper is involved in these processes and how it is delivered to the reproductive organs is not well understood. We show that copper deficiency alters not only the grain set but also flower development in both wheat and its recognized model, Brachypodium distachyon, We then show that a brachypodium yellow-stripe-like 3 (YSL3) transporter localizes to the phloem and mediates copper delivery to flag leaves, anthers and pistils. Failure to deliver copper to these structures in the ysl3 CRISPR/Cas9 mutant results in delayed flowering, altered inflorescence architecture, reduced floret fertility, grain number, size, and weight. These defects are rescued by copper supplementation and are complemented by the YSL3 cDNA. This new knowledge will help to devise sustainable approaches for improving grain yield in regions where soil quality is a major obstacle for crop production.",

Only 4 species were well documented in Neodon for a long period of time until last years when a systematic work described and added three new species, adjusted three species used to belong to Lasiopodomys, Phaiomys, Microtus to Neodon and removed one species (Neodon juldaschi) to genus Blanfordimys, leading to a total of eight species recorded in Neodon. To gain a better insight into the phylogeny and ecology of Neodon, we have systematically sampled Neodon species along the whole Hengduan and Himalayan Mountains in the last 20 years. In addition to morphological identification, we generated 1x - 15x whole genome sequencing (WGS) data and achieved the mitochondrial genomes and an average of 5,382 nuclear genes for each morpho-species. Both morphology and phylogeny results supported an extra six new species in Neodon (nominated Neodon shergylaensis sp. nov., N. namchabarwaensis sp. nov., N. liaoruii sp. nov., N. chayuensis sp. nov., N. bomiensis sp. nov., and N. bershulaensis sp. nov.). This is the first study that included Neodon samples covering its entire distribution area in China and this systematic sampling also revealed a long-time underestimation of Neodons diversity, and suggested its speciation events linked highly to founder event via dispersal (from Plateau to surrounding mountains). The results also revealed that the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is the center of origin of Neodon, and the impetus of speciation include climate change, isolation of rivers and mountains.",

    "abstract": "Hemocytes, the immune cells in mosquitoes, participate in immune defenses against pathogens including malaria parasites. Mosquito hemocytes can also be infected by arthropod-borne viruses but the pro- or anti-viral nature of this interaction is unknown. Although there has been progress on hemocyte characterization during pathogen infections in mosquitoes, the specific contribution of hemocytes to immune responses and the hemocyte-specific functions of immune genes and pathways remain unresolved due to the lack of genetic tools to manipulate gene expression in these cells specifically. Here, we used the Gal4-UAS system to characterize the activity of the Drosophila hemocyte-specific hemolectin promoter in the adults of Anopheles gambiae, the malaria mosquito. We established an hml-Gal4 driver line that we further crossed to a fluorescent UAS responder line, and examined the expression pattern in the adult progeny driven by the hml promoter. We show that the hml regulatory region drives hemocyte-specific transgene expression in a subset of hemocytes, and that transgene expression is triggered after a blood meal. The hml promoter drives transgene expression in differentiating prohemocytes as well as in differentiated granulocytes. Analysis of different immune markers in hemocytes in which the hml promoter drives transgene expression revealed that this regulatory region could be used to study phagocytosis as well as melanization. Finally, the hml promoter drives transgene expression in hemocytes in which onyongnyong virus replicates. Altogether, the hml promoter constitutes a good tool to drive transgene expression in hemocyte only and to analyze the function of these cells and the genes they express during pathogen infection in Anopheles gambiae.",

    "abstract": "Cone photoreceptor cell death in inherited retinal diseases, such as Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), leads to the loss of high acuity and color vision and ultimately to blindness. In RP, a vast number of mutations perturb the structure and function of rod photoreceptors while cones remain initially unaffected. Cone death follows rod death secondarily due to increased oxidative stress, inflammation, and loss of structural and nutritional support provided by rods. Here, we show that secondary cone cell death in animal models for RP was associated with an increased activity of histone deacetylates (HDACs). A single intravitreal injection of an HDAC inhibitor at a late stage of the disease, when majority of rods have already degenerated, was sufficient to delay cone death and support long-term cone survival. Moreover, the surviving cones remained light sensitive and initiated light-driven ganglion cell responses. RNA-seq analysis of protected cones demonstrated that HDAC inhibition led to multi-level protection via regulation of different pro-survival pathways, including MAPK, PI3K-Akt, and autophagy. This study suggests a unique possibility for a targeted pharmacological protection of both primary degenerating rods and secondary dying cones by HDAC inhibition and creates hope to maintain vision in RP patients independent of the disease stage.",

    "abstract": "Bees efficiently learn asocial and social cues to optimise foraging from fluctuating floral resources. However, it remains unclear how bees respond to divergent sources of social information, and whether such social cues might modify bees\u2019 natural preferences for non-social cues (e.g. flower colour), hence affecting foraging decisions. Here, we investigated honeybees\u2019 (Apis mellifera) inspection and choices of unfamiliar flowers based on both natural colour preferences and simultaneous foraging information from conspecifics and heterospecifics. Individual honeybees\u2019 preferences for flowers were recorded when the reward levels of a learned flower type had declined and novel-coloured flowers were available where they would find either no social information or one conspecific and one heterospecific (Bombus terrestris), each foraging from a different coloured flower (magenta or yellow). Honeybees showed a natural preference for magenta flowers. Honeybees modified their inspection of both types of flowers in response to conspecific and heterospecific social information. The presence of either demonstrator on the less-preferred yellow flower increased honeybees\u2019 inspection of yellow flowers.

    "abstract": "Bees efficiently learn asocial and social cues to optimise foraging from fluctuating floral resources. However, it remains unclear how bees respond to divergent sources of social information, and whether such social cues might modify bees\u2019 natural preferences for non-social cues (e.g. flower colour), hence affecting foraging decisions. Here, we investigated honeybees\u2019 (Apis mellifera) inspection and choices of unfamiliar flowers based on both natural colour preferences and simultaneous foraging information from conspecifics and heterospecifics. Individual honeybees\u2019 preferences for flowers were recorded when the reward levels of a learned flower type had declined and novel-coloured flowers were available where they would find either no social information or one conspecific and one heterospecific (Bombus terrestris), each foraging from a different coloured flower (magenta or yellow). Honeybees showed a natural preference for magenta flowers. Honeybees modified their inspection of both types of flowers in response to conspecific and heterospecific social information. The presence of either demonstrator on the less-preferred yellow flower increased honeybees\u2019 inspection of yellow flowers. Conspecific social information influenced observers\u2019 foraging choices of yellow flowers, thus outweighing their original preference for magenta flowers.

    "abstract": "Lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer mortality, exhibits heterogeneity that enables adaptability, limits therapeutic success, and remains incompletely understood. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of metastatic lung cancer was performed using 44 tumor biopsies obtained longitudinally from 27 patients before and during targeted therapy. Over 20,000 cancer and tumor microenvironment (TME) single-cell profiles exposed a rich and dynamic tumor ecosystem. scRNAseq of cancer cells illuminated targetable oncogenes beyond those detected clinically. Cancer cells surviving therapy as residual disease (RD) expressed an alveolar-regenerative cell signature suggesting a therapy-induced primitive cell state transition, whereas those present at on-therapy progressive disease (PD) upregulated kynurenine, plasminogen, and gap junction pathways. Active T-lymphocytes and decreased macrophages were present at RD and immunosuppressive cell states characterized PD. Biological features revealed by scRNAseq were biomarkers of clinical outcomes in independent cohorts. This study highlights how therapy-induced adaptation of the multi-cellular ecosystem of metastatic cancer shapes clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Common alder (Alnus glutinosa) is an important tree species, especially in riparian and wet habitats. Alder is very common across Ireland and Northern Ireland, and provides a wide range of ecosystem services. Surveys along the river Lagan in Belfast, Northern Ireland led to the detection of several diseased Alnus trees. As it is known that Alnus suffers from a Phytophthora induced decline, this research set out to identify the presence and scale of the risk to Alnus health from Phytophthora and other closely related oomycetes. Sampling and a combination of morphological and molecular testing of symptomatic plant material and river baits identified the presence of several Phytophthora species, including Phytophthora lacustris. A survey of the tree vegetation along an 8.5 km stretch of the river revealed that of the 166 Alnus trees counted, 28 were severely defoliated/diseased and 9 were dead. Inoculation studies using potted Alnus saplings demonstrate that P. lacustris was able to cause disease, and Kochs postulates for this pathogen-host combination were completed, which suggests a future risk to Alnus health from P. lacustris in Northern Ireland.",

Embedding living cyanobacteria between the mirrors of an optical microresonator and using low intensity white light irradiation we observe vacuum Rabi splitting in the transmission and fluorescence spectra as a result of strong light matter coupling of the chlorophyll and the resonator modes. The Rabi-splitting scales with the number of chlorophyll a pigments involved in coherent coupling indicating forming a polaritonic state which is delocalized over the entire cyanobacterial thylakoid system, down to the single photon level. Our data provide evidence that a delocalized polaritonic state is the basis of the extremely high energy transfer efficiency under natural conditions.",

    "abstract": "Chromosome segregation in eukaryotes is driven by the kinetochore, the macromolecular protein complex that assembles onto centromeric DNA and binds spindle microtubules. Cells must tightly control the number and position of kinetochores so that all chromosomes assemble a single kinetochore. A central player in this process is the centromere-specific histone H3 variant CENP-A, which localizes constitutively at centromeres and promotes kinetochore assembly. However, CENP-A is absent from several eukaryotic lineages including kinetoplastids, a group of evolutionarily divergent eukaryotes that have an unconventional set of kinetochore proteins. There are six proteins that localize constitutively at centromeres in the kinetoplastid parasite Trypanosoma brucei, among which two homologous protein kinases (KKT2 and KKT3) have limited similarity to polo-like kinases. In addition to the N-terminal kinase domain and the C-terminal divergent polo boxes, KKT2 and KKT3 have a central domain of unknown function as well as putative DNA-binding motifs. Here we show that KKT2 and KKT3 are important for the localization of several kinetochore proteins and that their central domains are sufficient for centromere localization in T. brucei. Crystal structures of the KKT2 central domain from two divergent kinetoplastids reveal a unique zinc-binding domain (termed the CL domain for centromere localization), which promotes its kinetochore localization in T. brucei. Mutations in the equivalent domain in KKT3 abolish its kinetochore localization and function. Our work shows that the unique central domains play a critical role in mediating the centromere localization of KKT2 and KKT3.",

    "abstract": "In order to study the causes of pine wood nematode (PWN) departure from Monochamus alternatus, the effects of the feeding behavior of M. alternatus on the start date of the departure of PWN were studied. The start date of the departure of PWN carried by the directly fed M. alternatus was 5\u201413 d after beetle emergence, mainly concentrated within 6\u201410 d, with a mean (\u00b1SD) of 8.02 \u00b1 1.96 d. The start date of the departure of PWN carried by the M. alternatus fed after starvation was 5\u201414 d after beetle emergence, mainly concentrated within 6\u20149 d, with a mean of 7.76 \u00b1 2.28 d. The results show that there was no significant difference in the start departure date of PWN between the two treatments. This shows that the feeding behavior of M. alternatus is not the trigger for PWN departure. At the same time, it was found that the motility of the PWN carried by M. alternatus at 8 d after emergence was significantly greater than that of the PWN carried by the newly emerged M. alternatus. And the PWN carried by M. alternatus at 8 d after emergence was extracted more easily than the PWN carried by newly emerged beetles. These results show that greater motility was associated with easier departure of PWN from M. alternatus. In addition, transcriptome sequencing found that the level of oxidative phosphorylation metabolism of PWN carried by beetles at 8 d after emergence was significantly higher than that in the PWN carried by newly emerged beetle. High oxidative phosphorylation was associated with increased energy production and motility by the PWN and were the internal cause of the start of nematode departure.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Current expression quantification methods suffer from a fundamental but under-characterized type of error: the most likely estimates for transcript abundances are not unique. This means multiple estimates of transcript abundances generate the observed RNA-seq reads with equal likelihood, and the underlying true expression cannot be determined. This problem is called non-identifiability for probabilistic models, and is further exacerbated by incomplete reference transcriptome. That is, reads may be sequenced from unannotated expressed transcripts. Graph quantification is a generalization to transcript quantification, accounting for the reference incompleteness by allowing exponentially many unannotated transcripts to express reads. We propose methods to calculate a \"confidence range of expression\" for each transcript, representing its possible abundance across equally optimal estimates for both quantification models. This range informs both whether a transcript has potential estimation error due to non-identifiability and the extent of the error. Applying our methods to the Human Body Map data, we observe 35%-50% of transcripts potentially suffer from inaccurate quantification caused by non-identifiability. When comparing the expression between isoforms in one sample, we find that the degree of inaccuracy of 20%-47% transcripts can be so large that the ranking of expression between the transcript and its sibling isoforms cannot be determined. When comparing the expression of a transcript between two groups of RNA-seq samples in differential expression analysis, we observe that the majority of detected differentially expressed transcripts are reliable with a few exceptions after considering the ranges of the optimal expression estimates.

    "abstract": "Infestation by dipterous larvae - myiasis - is a major problem for livestock industries worldwide and can cause severe economic losses. The Oestroidea superfamily is an interesting model to study the evolution of myiasis-causing flies because of the diversity of parasitism strategies among closely-related species. These flies are saprophagous, obligate parasites, or facultative parasites and can be subdivided into cutaneous, nasopharyngeal, traumatic, and furuncular. We expect that closely-related species have genetic differences that lead to the diverse parasitic strategies. To identify genes with such differences, we used gene expression and coding sequence data from five species (Cochliomyia hominivorax, Chrysomya megacephala, Lucilia cuprina, Dermatobia hominis, and Oestrus ovis). We tested whether 1,287 orthologs have different expression and evolutionary constraints under different scenarios. We found two up-regulated genes; one in species causing cutaneous myiasis that is involved in iron transportation/metabolization (ferritin), and another in species causing traumatic myiasis that responds to reduced oxygen levels (anoxia up-regulated-like). Our evolutionary analysis showed a similar result. In the Ch. hominivorax branch, we found one gene with the same function as ferritin that may be evolving under positive selection, spook. This is the first step towards understanding origins and evolution of parasitic strategy diversity in Oestroidea.",

The construct consists of the electrondonor fluorophore eCFP and the acceptor citrine, linked by a calcium sensitive domain. Its conformation and therefore donor quenching is directly linked to cytosolic calcium concentrations. By combining intravital two-photon fluorescence lifetime microscopy with our numerical approach for phasor-based analysis, we are able to extract absolute cytoplasmic calcium concentrations in activated B cells for the first time in vivo. We show that calcium concentrations in B cells are highly dynamic and fluctuations persist in extrafollicular B cells with functional relevance.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral sensory neurons switch to a regenerative state after nerve injury to enable axon regeneration and functional recovery. Intrinsic mechanisms operating in sensory neurons are known to regulate nerve repair, but whether satellite glial cells (SGC), which completely envelop the neuronal soma, undergo injury-evoked transcriptional changes and contribute to nerve regeneration remains unexplored. This is largely due to the lack of molecular and genetic tools to study SGC. Using a single cell RNAseq approach to define the transcriptional profile of SGC in naive and injured conditions, we reveal that these cells are distinct from Schwann cells and share similarities with astrocytes. We find that nerve injury elicits gene expression changes in SGC, which are related to fatty acid synthesis and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling. Conditional deletion of Fatty acid synthase (Fasn), the committed enzyme in de novo fatty acid synthesis, in SGC, impairs axon regeneration. The PPAR agonist fenofibrate rescues the impaired axon regeneration in mice lacking Fasn in SGC, indicating that PPAR functions downstream of fatty acid synthesis in SGC to promote axon regeneration. These results identify fatty acid synthesis in SGC as a fundamental novel mechanism mediating axon regeneration in adult peripheral nerves. These results also highlight that the sensory neuron and its surrounding glial coat form a functional unit that orchestrates nerve repair.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo evaluate effects of a common CT contrast agent (iohexol) on the mechanical behaviors of cartilage and meniscus.\n\nMethodsIndentation responses of juvenile bovine cartilage and meniscus were monitored following exposure to undiluted contrast agent (100% CA), 50% CA/water, 50% CA/Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) or PBS alone, and during re-equilibration in PBS. The normalized peak force [Formula], effective osmotic strain ({varepsilon}osm), and normalized effective contact modulus [Formula] were calculated for every cycle, with time constants determined for both exposure and recovery via mono- or biexponential fits to [Formula].\n\nResultsAll cartilage CA groups exhibited long-term increases in [Formula] following exposure, although the hyperosmolal 100% CA and 50% CA/PBS groups showed an initial transient decrease. Meniscus presented opposing trends, with decreasing [Formula] for all CA groups. Re-equilibration in PBS for 1hr after exposure to 100% CA did not produce recovery to baseline [Formula] in either tissue. The recovery time for meniscus was substantially longer than that of cartilage. [Formula] increased with CA exposure time for cartilage but decreased for meniscus, suggesting an increased effective stiffness for cartilage and decreased stiffness for meniscus. Long-term changes to{varepsilon} osm in both tissues were consistent with changes in [Formula].\n\nConclusionExposure to iohexol solutions affected joint tissues differentially, with increased cartilage stiffness, likely relating to competing hyperosmotic and hypotonic interactions with tissue fixed charges, and decreased meniscus stiffness, likely dominated by hyperosmolarity. These altered tissue mechanics could allow non-physiological deformation during ambulatory weight-bearing, resulting in an increased risk of tissue or cell damage.",

Using a combination of functional genomics, genetic and biochemical approaches here we show that Zbtb11 plays essential roles in maintaining the homeostasis of mitochondrial function. Mechanistically, we find Zbtb11 facilitates the recruitment of Nuclear Respiratory Factor 2 (NRF-2) to its target promoters, activating a subset of nuclear genes with roles in the biogenesis of respiratory complex I and the mitoribosome. Genetic inactivation of Zbtb11 resulted in a severe complex I assembly defect, impaired mitochondrial respiration, mitochondrial depolarisation, and ultimately proliferation arrest and cell death. Experimental modelling of the pathogenic human mutations showed these have a destabilising effect on the protein, resulting in reduced Zbtb11 dosage, down-regulation of its target genes, and impaired complex I biogenesis. Our study establishes Zbtb11 as a novel essential mitochondrial regulator, improves our understanding of the transcriptional mechanisms of nuclear control over mitochondria, and provides a rationale for the aetiology of Zbtb11-associated intellectual disability.",

Superantigenicity, its hallmark function, was proposed to be a major underlying mechanism driving SAIE but was not directly tested. With the use of S. aureus MW2 expressing SEC toxoids, we show that superantigenicity does not sufficiently account for vegetation growth, myocardial inflammation, and acute kidney injury in the rabbit model of native valve SAIE. These results highlight the critical contribution of an alternative function of superantigens to SAIE. In support of this, we provide evidence that SEC exerts anti-angiogenic effects by inhibiting branching microvessel formation in an ex vivo rabbit aortic ring model and by inhibiting endothelial cell expression of one of the most potent mediators of angiogenesis, VEGF-A. SECs ability to interfere with tissue re-vascularization and remodeling after injury serves as a mechanism to promote SAIE and its life-threatening systemic pathologies.",

    "abstract": "We rely upon visual short-term memory (VSTM) for continued access to perceptual information that is no longer available. Despite the complexity of our visual environments, the majority of research on VSTM has focused on memory for lower-level perceptual features. Using more naturalistic stimuli, it has been found that recognizable objects are remembered better than unrecognizable objects. What remains unclear, however, is how semantic information changes brain representations in order to facilitate this improvement in VSTM for real-world objects. To address this question, we used a continuous report paradigm to assess VSTM (precision and guessing rate) while participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the underlying neural representation of 96 objects from 4 animate and 4 inanimate categories. To isolate semantic content, we used a novel image generation method that parametrically warps images until they are no longer recognizable while preserving basic visual properties. We found that intact objects were remembered with greater precision and a lower guessing rate than unrecognizable objects (this also emerged when objects were grouped by category and animacy). Representational similarity analysis of the ventral visual stream found evidence of category and animacy information in anterior visual areas during encoding only, but not during maintenance. These results suggest that the effect of semantic information during encoding in ventral visual areas boosts visual short-term memory for real-world objects.",

    "abstract": "Large sterile male releases are the gold standard for most insect population control methods and thus precise sex sorting is essential to the success of these technologies. Sex sorting is especially important for mosquito control because female mosquitoes bite and transmit diseases. However, current methods for insect sex sorting have deficiencies as they are error prone, low throughput, expensive, reduce male fitness, or lack cross species adaptability. Here we describe a novel drug-inducible system for insect sex-separation that demonstrates proof-of-principle for positive sex selection in D. melanogaster. The system exploits the toxicity of commonly used broad-spectrum antibiotics geneticin and puromycin and rescues only one sex. Sex specific rescue is achieved by inserting the sex-specific introns, TraF and DsxM, into the coding sequence of antibiotic resistance genes, NeoR or PuroR. We engineer a dual sex-sorter gene cassette and demonstrate sex specific, constitutive expression of NeoR and PuroR proteins in females and males, respectively. When raised on geneticin supplements, this sex-sorter line established 100% positive selection for female progeny, while the food supplemented with puromycin generated 100% male progeny. This system is 100% efficient and operates at remarkably low fitness costs in D. melanogaster. Since the described system exploits a conserved sex-specific splicing mechanism and reagents, which are active in many insects, it has the potential to be adaptable to insect species of medical and agricultural importance.\n\nGRAPHIC ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=65 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/875716v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4b98b3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11637edorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b1cc0aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cac010_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTComputational learning methods allow researchers to make predictions, draw inferences, and automate generation of mathematical models. These models are crucial to solving real world problems, such as antimicrobial resistance, pathogen detection, and protein evolution. Machine learning methods depend upon ground truth data to achieve specificity and sensitivity. Since the data is limited in this case, as we will show during the course of this paper, and as the size of available data increases super-linearly, it is of paramount importance to understand the distribution of ground truth data and the analyses it is suited and where it may have limitations that bias downstream learning methods. In this paper, we focus on training data required to model antimicrobial resistance (AR). We report an analysis of bacterial biochemical assay data associated with whole genome sequencing (WGS) from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), and discuss important implications when making use of assay data, utilizing genetic features as training data for machine learning models. Complete discussion of machine learning model implementation is outside the scope of this paper and the subject to a later publication.\n\nThe antimicrobial assay data was obtained from NCBI BioSample, which contains descriptive information about the physical biological specimen from which experimental data is obtained and the results of those experiments themselves.[1] Assay data includes minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of antibiotics, links to associated microbial WGS data, and treatment of a particular microorganism with antibiotics.\n\nWe observe that there is minimal microbial data available for many antibiotics and for targeted taxonomic groups. The antibiotics with the highest number of assays have less than 1500 measurements each. Corresponding bias in available assays makes machine learning problematic for some important microbes and for building more advanced models that can work across microbial genera. In this study we focus, therefore, on the antibiotic with most assay data (tetracycline) and the corresponding genus with the most available sequence (Acinetobacter with 14000 measurements across 49 antibiotic compounds). Using this data for training and testing, we observed contradictions in the distribution of assay outcomes and report methods to identify and resolve such conflicts. Per antibiotic, we find that there can be up to 30% of (resolvable) conflicting measurements. As more data becomes available, automated training data curation will be an important part of creating useful machine learning models to predict antibiotic resistance.\n\nCCS CONCEPTS* Applied computing [-&gt;] Computational biology; Computational genomics; Bioinformatics;",

The popular approaches to this require aligning each pair of sequences to calculate pairwise distances or aligning all the sequences to construct a multiple sequence alignment. The computational complexity and difficulties in getting accurate alignments have led to development of alignment-free methods to estimate phylogenies. However, the alignment free approaches focus on computing distances between species and do not utilize statistical approaches for phylogeny estimation. Herein, we present a simple alignment free method for phylogeny construction based on contiguous sub-sequences of length k termed k-mers. The presence or absence of these k-mers are used to construct a phylogeny using a maximum likelihood approach. The results suggest our method is competitive with other alignment-free approaches, while outperforming them in some cases.",

Optimal results were achieved using fibroblast-feeder-supported hPSCs compared to feeder-independent cells, related to differences in their transcriptomic states. Feeder-supported hPSCs display elevated activation of diverse TGF{beta} superfamily signaling pathways and increased expression of genes associated with naive pluripotency.

    "abstract": "The mechanisms resulting in the breakdown of the coral symbiosis once the process of bleaching has been initiated remain unclear. Distinguishing symbiont loss from the abiotic stress response may shed light on the cellular and molecular pathways involved in each process. This study examined physiological changes and global gene expression patterns associated with white patch syndrome (WPS) in P. lobata, which manifests in localized bleaching independent of thermal stress. In addition, a meta-analysis of global gene expression studies in other corals and anemones was used to contrast differential regulation as a result of abiotic stress from expression patterns correlated with symbiotic state. Symbiont density, chlorophyll a content, holobiont productivity, instant calcification rate, and total host protein content were uniformly reduced in WPS relative to healthy tissue. While expression patterns associated with WPS were secondary to fixed effects of source colony, specific functional enrichments suggest that the viral infection putatively giving rise to this condition affects symbiont rather than host cells. The meta-analysis revealed that expression patterns in WPS-affected tissues were significantly correlated with prior studies examining short-term thermal stress responses. This correlation was independent of symbiotic state, as the strongest correlations were found between WPS adults and both symbiotic adult and aposymbiotic coral larvae experiencing thermal stress, suggesting that the majority of expression changes reflect a non-specific stress response. Across studies, the magnitude and direction of expression change among particular functional enrichments suggests unique responses to stressor duration, and highlights unique responses to bleaching in an anemone model which engages in a non-obligate symbiosis.",

    "abstract": "DNA metabarcoding has become a powerful technique for identifying species and profiling biodiversity with the potential to improve efficiency, reveal rare prey species, and correct mistaken identification error in diet studies. However, the extent to which molecular approaches agree with traditional approaches is unknown for many species. Here, we compare diets from wolf scats profiled using both mechanical sorting and metabarcoding of amplified vertebrate DNA sequences. Our objectives were: (1) compare findings from mechanical sorting and metabarcoding as a method of diet profiling and (2) use results to better understand diets of wolves on Prince of Wales Island, a population of conservation concern. We predicted metabarcoding would reveal both higher diversity of prey and identify rare species that are overlooked with mechanical sorting. We also posited that the relative contribution of Sitka black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis) and beaver (Castor canadensis) would be overestimated with mechanical sorting methods because of the failure to account for the full diet diversity of these wolves. We found that there was substantial overlap in the diets revealed using both methods, indicating that deer, beaver, and black bear (Ursus americanus) were the primary prey species. However, there was a large discrepancy in the occurrence of beaver in scats (54% and 24% from mechanical sorting and metabarcoding, respectively) explained by the high rate of false positives with mechanical sorting methods. Metabarcoding revealed more diet diversity than mechanical sorting, thus supporting our initial predictions. Prince of Wales Island wolves appear to have a more diverse diet with greater occurrence of rare species than previously described including 14 prey species that contribute to wolf diet. Metabarcoding is an effective method for profiling carnivore diet and enhances our knowledge concerning the full diversity of wolf diets, even in the extremely wet conditions of southeast Alaska, which can lead to DNA degradation. Given the increasingly efficient and cost-effective nature of collecting eDNA, we recommend incorporating these molecular methods into field-based projects to further examine questions related to increased use of alternate prey coinciding with changes in abundance of primary prey and habitat alteration.",

Here, we propose a partitioned form of genomic selection, called Origin Specific Genomic Selection (OSGS), where we identify and target selection on favourable exotic alleles. Briefly, within a population derived from a bi-parental cross, we isolate alleles originating from the elite and exotic parents, which then allows us to separate out the predicted marker effects based on the allele origins. We validated the usefulness of OSGS using two nested association mapping (NAM) datasets: barley NAM (elite-exotic) and maize NAM (elite-elite), as well as by computer simulation. Our results suggest that OSGS works well in bi-parental crosses, and it is possible to extend the approach to broader multi-parental populations.",

Synaptic iGluSnFR signal time courses vary widely depending on experimental conditions and often last 10-100 times longer than the extracellular lifetime of synaptically released glutamate estimated with uptake measurements. iGluSnFR signals typically also decay much more slowly than the unbinding kinetics of the indicator. To resolve these discrepancies, here we have modeled synaptic glutamate diffusion, uptake and iGluSnFR activation to identify factors influencing iGluSnFR signal waveforms. Simulations suggested that iGluSnFR competes with transporters to bind synaptically released glutamate, delaying glutamate uptake. Accordingly, synaptic transporter currents recorded in iGluSnFR-expressing cortical astrocytes were slower than those in control astrocytes. Simulations also suggested that iGluSnFR reduces free glutamate levels in extrasynaptic spaces, likely limiting extrasynaptic receptor activation. iGluSnFR and lower-affinity variants nonetheless provide linear indications of vesicle release, underscoring their value for optical quantal analysis.",

    "abstract": "Organisms can adapt to a broad spectrum of sudden and dramatic changes in their environment. These abrupt changes are often perceived as stress and trigger responses that facilitate survival and eventual adaptation. The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is involved in most cellular processes. Unsurprisingly, components of the UPS also play crucial roles during various stress response programs. The budding yeast SCFMet30 complex is an essential Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase that connects metabolic and heavy metal stress to cell cycle regulation. Cadmium exposure results in the active dissociation of the F-box protein Met30 from the core ligase leading to SCFMet30 inactivation. Consequently, SCFMet30 substrate ubiquitylation is blocked and triggers a downstream cascade to activate a specific transcriptional stress response program. Signal-induced dissociation is initiated by autoubiquitylation of Met30 and serves as a recruitment signal for the AAA-ATPase Cdc48/p97, which actively disassembles the complex. Here we show that the UBX cofactor Shp1/p47 is an additional key element for SCFMet30 disassembly during heavy metal stress. Although the cofactor can directly interact with the ATPase, Cdc48 and Shp1 are recruited independently to SCFMet30 during cadmium stress. An intact UBX domain is crucial for effective SCFMet30 disassembly, and a concentration threshold of Shp1 recruited to SCFMet30 needs to be exceeded to initiate Met30 dissociation. The latter is likely related to Shp1-mediated control of Cdc48 ATPase activity. This study identifies Shp1 as the crucial Cdc48 cofactor for signal-induced, selective disassembly of a multi-subunit protein complex to modulate activity.\n\nSignificance StatementUbiquitylation affects many important cellular processes, and has been linked to a number of human diseases. It has become a synonym for protein degradation, but ubiquitylation also has important non-proteolytic signaling functions. Understanding the molecular concepts that govern ubiquitin signaling is of great importance for development of diagnostics and therapeutics. The cadmium-induced inactivation of the SCFMet30 ubiquitin ligase via the disassembly of the multi-subunit ligase complex, illustrates an example for non-proteolytic signaling pathways. Dissociation is triggered by autoubiquitylation of the F-box protein Met30, which is the recruiting signal for the highly conserved AAA-ATPase Cdc48/p97. Here we show that the UBX cofactor Shp1/p47 is important for this ubiquitin-dependent, active remodeling of a multi-protein complex in response to a specific environmental signal.",

    "abstract": "Diversity of the CRISPR locus of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex has been studied since 1997 for molecular epidemiology purposes. By targeting solely the 43 spacers present in the two first sequenced genomes (H37Rv and BCG), it gave a biased idea of CRISPR diversity and ignored diversity in the neighbouring cas-genes.\n\nWe set up tailored pipelines to explore the diversity of CRISPR-cas locus in Short Reads. We analyzed data from a representative set of 198 clinical isolates as evidenced by well-characterized SNPs.\n\nWe found a relatively low diversity in terms of spacers: we recovered only the 68 spacers that had been described in 2000. We found no partial or global inversions in the sequences, letting always the Direct Variant Repeats (DVR) in the same order. In contrast, we found an unexpected diversity in the form of: SNPs in spacers and in Direct Repeats, duplications of various length, and insertions at various locations of the IS6110 insertion sequence, as well as blocks of DVR deletions. The diversity was in part specific to lineages. When reconstructing evolutionary steps of the locus, we found no evidence for SNP reversal. DVR deletions were linked to recombination between IS6110 insertions or between Direct Repeats.\n\nThis work definitively shows that CRISPR locus of M. tuberculosis did not evolve by classical CRISPR adaptation (incorporation of new spacers) since the last most recent common ancestor of virulent lineages. The evolutionary mechanisms that we discovered could be involved in bacterial adaptation but in a way that remains to be identified.",

In LBC1936, connectome-wide and subnetwork-specific composite indices of node integrity were predictive of processing speed, visuospatial ability, and memory, whereas composite indices of edge integrity were associated specifically with processing speed. Childhood IQ was associated with greater node integrity at age 73. However, node and edge integrity remained associated with age 73 cognitive function after controlling for childhood IQ. Adult connectome integrity is therefore both a marker of early-life cognitive function and a substrate of late-life cognitive aging.",

However, all gene clustering pipelines are based on the analysis of protein distances, which are subject to many artefacts. In this paper we introduce Broccoli, a user-friendly pipeline designed to infer, with high precision, orthologous groups and pairs of proteins using a phylogeny-based approach. Briefly, Broccoli performs ultra-fast phylogenetic analyses on most proteins and builds a network of orthologous relationships. Orthologous groups are then identified from the network using a parameter-free machine learning algorithm. Broccoli is also able to detect chimeric proteins resulting from gene-fusion events and to assign these proteins to the corresponding orthologous groups. Tested on two benchmark datasets, Broccoli outperforms current orthology pipelines. In addition, Broccoli is scalable, with runtimes similar to those of recent distance-based pipelines. Given its high level of performance and efficiency, this new pipeline represents a suitable choice for comparative genomic studies.\n\nBroccoli is freely available at https://github.com/rderelle/Broccoli.",

A myriad of macromolecules, including the protein FUS, form condensates which behave as isotropic liquids. Here, we investigate the influence of filament dopants on the material properties of protein liquids. We find that the short, biopolymer filaments of actin spontaneously partition into FUS droplets to form composite liquid droplets. As the concentration of the filament dopants increases, the coalescence time decreases, indicating that the dopants control the relative surface tension to viscosity. The droplet shape is tunable ranging from spherical to tactoid as the filament length or concentration is increased. We find that the tactoids are well described by a model of a bipolar liquid crystal droplet, where nematic order from the anisotropic actin filaments competes with isotropic interfacial energy from the FUS, controlling droplet shape in a size-dependent manner. Our results demonstrate a versatile approach to construct tunable, anisotropic macromolecular liquids.",

While several groups have shown that TF-deficient virus exhibits reduced virulence, mechanism(s) by which this occurs remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate a role for TF in antagonizing the host interferon response. Using wild-type and type 1 interferon receptor-deficient mice and primary cells derived from these animals, we show that TF controls the induction of the host interferon responses at early times during infection. Loss of TF production leads to elevated interferon and a concurrent reduction in viral loads with a loss of pathogenicity. Palmitoylation of TF has been shown to be important for particle assembly and morphology. We find that palmitoylation of TF also contributes to the ability of TF to antagonize host interferon responses as dysregulated palmitoylation of TF reduces virulence in a manner similar to loss of TF.",

    "abstract": "Environmental sources of infection can play a primary role in shaping epidemiological dynamics, however the relative impact of environmental transmission on host-pathogen systems is rarely estimated. We developed and fit a spatially-explicit model of African swine fever virus (ASFV) in wild boar to estimate what proportion of carcass-based transmission is contributing to the low-level persistence of ASFV in Eastern European wild boar. Our model was developed based on ecological insight and data from field studies of ASFV and wild boar in Eastern Poland. We predicted that carcass-based transmission would play a substantial role in persistence, especially in low-density host populations where contact rates are low. By fitting the model to outbreak data using Approximate Bayesian Computation, we inferred that between 53 to 66% of transmission events were carcass-based - i.e., transmitted through contact of a live host with a contaminated carcass. Model fitting and sensitivity analyses showed that the frequency of carcass-based transmission increased with decreasing host density, suggesting that management policies should emphasize the removal of carcasses and consider how reductions in host densities may drive carcass-based transmission. Sensitivity analyses also demonstrated that carcass-based transmission is necessary for the autonomous persistence of ASFV under realistic parameters. Autonomous persistence through direct transmission alone required high host densities; otherwise re-introduction of virus periodically was required for persistence when direct transmission probabilities were moderately high. We quantify the relative role of different persistence mechanisms for a low-prevalence disease using readily collected ecological data and viral surveillance data. Understanding how the frequency of different transmission mechanisms vary across host densities can help identify optimal management strategies across changing ecological conditions.",

    "abstract": "F-Actin remodelling is important for the spread of HIV via cell-cell contacts, yet the mechanisms by which HIV corrupts the actin cytoskeleton are poorly understood. Through live cell imaging and focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM), we observed F-Actin structures that exhibit strong positive curvature to be enriched for HIV buds. Virion proteomics, gene silencing, and viral mutagenesis supported a Cdc42-IQGAP1-Arp2/3 pathway as the primary intersection of HIV budding, membrane curvature and F-Actin regulation. Whilst HIV egress activated the Cdc42-Arp2/3 filopodial pathway, this came at the expense of cell-free viral release. Importantly, release could be rescued by cell-cell contact, provided Cdc42 and IQGAP1 were present. From these observations we conclude that a proportion out-going HIV has corrupted a central F-Actin node that enables initial coupling of HIV buds to cortical F-Actin to place HIV at the leading cell edge. Whilst this initially prevents particle release, maturation of cell-cell contacts signals back to this F-Actin node to enable viral release & subsequent infection of the contacting cell.",

    "abstract": "Protomyces is a genus of yeast-like fungi that is currently defined as plant pathogens of only the Umbelliferae (Apiaceae) and Compositae (Asteraceae) family plants. Many Protomyces species have been proposed; however, there is a lack of molecular data and available specimens for Protomyces spp., just over ten species are officially accepted and only six species are preserved and available in public culture collections for examination. Phylogenetic relationships and species boundaries within this genus remain largely controversial. Recently, we isolated Protomyces strains from wild Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), a Brassicaceae family plant only distantly related to the accepted Protomyces hosts. We have previously sequenced the genomes of all the currently public available Protomyces species, together with a strain (SC29) we isolated from the Arabidopsis phyllosphere. Genome-wide phylogenetic analysis suggests that SC29 occupies a unique phylogenetic position in the genus Protomyces. The SC29 genome has low average nucleotide identity values in comparison with other species genomes. As physiological evidence, SC29 has morphological characteristics and carbon assimilation patterns that distinguish it from the other six Protomyces species. Analysis with several nuclear gene phylogenetic markers further confirms SC29 as a novel Protomyces species and suggests the act1 gene DNA sequences can be used together with ITS sequences for the rapid identification of Protomyces species. In our previous study, SC29 could persist on the Arabidopsis phyllosphere in both short term laboratory and overwinter outdoor garden experiments and Protomyces spp. (or OTUs) were found in the Arabidopsis phyllosphere at multiple sites in both Finland and Germany. We conclude that SC29 is a novel Protomyces species isolated from Arabidopsis and propose the name of Protomyces arabidopsidicola sp. nov. Additionally, the genus Protomyces may not be strictly associated with only Compositae or Umbelliferae family host plants, as evidenced by SC29 and Protomyces strains previously isolated from plants in other families. The merging of two Protomyces species found to have high genomic similarity (P. inouyei and P. lactucaedebilis) is also proposed.",

We identified thousands of predominantly bistable (CpG methylated or unmethylated) regions within neuronal gene bodies, established during the development of the mouse hippocampal dentate gyrus. Reducing DNA methylation and the proportion of the methylated epialleles at bistable regions compromised novel context-induced neuronal activation and spatial memory. Conversely, increasing methylation and the frequency of the methylated epialleles at bistable regions enhanced intrinsic excitability and spatial memory but impaired spatial working memory, indicating that the developmentally established methylated-unmethylated epiallelic balance at bistable regions is essential for proper neuronal excitability and hippocampal cognitive functions. Single-nucleus profiling revealed the enrichment of specific epialleles from a subset of bistable regions, primarily exonic, in encoding neurons. We propose a model in which epigenetically bistable regions create neuron heterogeneity, and specific constellations of exonic epialleles dictate, via modulating neuronal excitability, eligibility to a coding ensemble.",

By combining Illumina short-read and nanopore long-read direct RNA sequencing approaches, we mapped transcription start sites and cleavage and polyadenylation sites across the adenovirus genome. The canonical viral early and late RNA cassettes were confirmed, but analysis of splice junctions within long RNA reads revealed an additional 20 novel viral transcripts. These RNAs include seven new splice junctions which lead to expression of canonical open reading frames (ORF), as well as 13 transcripts encoding for messages that potentially alter protein functions through truncations or the fusion of canonical ORFs. In addition, we also detect RNAs that bypass canonical cleavage sites and generate potential chimeric proteins by linking separate gene transcription units.

This permissive/enabling function of neuromodulators has been associated with their capacity to facilitate the induction of Hebbian forms of long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) by affecting cellular and network excitability. In vitro studies indicate that neuromodulators can also affect the expression of Hebbian plasticity in a pull-push manner: receptors coupled to the G-protein Gs promote the expression of LTP at the expense of LTD, and Gq-coupled receptors promote LTD at the expense of LTD. Here we show that the pull-push mechanism can be recruited in vivo by pairing brief monocular stimulation with pharmacological or chemogenetical activation of Gs- or Gq-coupled receptors to respectively enhance or reduce visual cortical responses. These changes were stable, can be induced in adults after the termination of the critical period for juvenile ocular dominance plasticity, and can rescue deficits induced by prolonged monocular deprivation.",

    "abstract": "Thirty-four years since the small nervous system of the nematode C. elegans was manually reconstructed in the electron microscope (EM)1,  high-throughput EM techniques now enable the dense reconstruction of neural circuits within increasingly large brain volumes at synaptic resolution2-6. As with C. elegans, however, a key limitation for inferring brain function from neuronal wiring diagrams is that it remains unknown how the structure of a synapse seen in EM relates to its physiological transmission strength. Here, we related structure and function of the same synapses to bridge this gap: we combined paired whole-cell recordings of synaptically connected pyramidal neurons in slices of mouse somatosensory cortex with correlated light microscopy and high-resolution EM of all putative synaptic contacts between the neurons. We discovered a linear relationship between synapse size (postsynaptic density area) and synapse strength (excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitude), which provides an experimental foundation for assigning the actual physiological weights to synaptic connections seen in the EM. Furthermore, quantal analysis revealed that the number of vesicle release sites exceeded the number of anatomical synapses formed by a connection by a factor of at least 2.6, which challenges the current understanding of synaptic release in neocortex and suggests that neocortical synapses operate with multivesicular release, like hippocampal synapses7-11. Thus, neocortical synapses are more complex computational devices and may modulate their strength more flexibly than previously thought, with the corollary that the canonical neocortical microcircuitry possesses significantly higher computational power than estimated by current models.",

Here we have extensively characterized an ex-vivo cultured human lung derived, precision-cut lung slices model (hPCLS) using live fluorescence light microscopy as well as mass spectrometry-based techniques to obtain a proteomic and metabolomic fingerprint. Using an integrated approach of multiple readouts such as quantitative label-free Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) imaging to measure fibrillar collagen in the extracellular matrix and ELISA-based methods to measure soluble ECM biomarkers, we investigated TGFbeta1-mediated pro-fibrotic signalling in hPCLS. We demonstrate that hPCLS are viable and metabolically active with mesenchymal, epithelial, endothelial, and immune cells surviving for at least two weeks in ex vivo culture. Analysis of hPCLS-conditioned supernatants showed strong induction of ECM synthesis proteins P1NP and fibronectin upon TGFb stimulation. Importantly, this effect translated into an increased deposition of fibrillar collagen in ECM of cultured hPCLS as measured by a novel quantitative SHG-based imaging method only following addition of a metalloproteinase inhibitor (GM6001). Together the data show that an integrated approach of measuring soluble pro-fibrotic markers and quantitative SHG-based analysis of fibrillar collagen is a valuable tool for studying pro-fibrotic signalling and testing anti-fibrotic agents.",

    "abstract": "Guanosine tetraphosphate (G4P) and guanosine pentaphosphate (G5P) are signalling nucleotides found in bacteria and photosynthetic eukaryotes that are implicated in a wide-range of processes including stress acclimation, developmental transitions and growth control. Measurements of G4P/G5P levels are essential for studying the diverse roles of these nucleotides. However, G4P/G5P quantification is particularly challenging in plants and algae due to lower cellular concentrations, compartmentation and high metabolic complexity. Despite recent advances the speed and accuracy of G4P quantification in plants and algae can still be improved. Here, we report a new approach for rapid and accurate G4P quantification, applicable to plants and algae, which relies on the use of synthesised stable isotope-labelled as internal standards. We anticipate that this approach will accelerate research into the function of G4P signaling in plants, algae and other organisms.",

    "abstract": "AimTo determine the prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis, socio-cultural practices and health seeking behaviour of tribal people in four districts of Odisha.\n\nMethodologyThis was an action research study with qualitative and quantitative design following a sequential approach implemented in a 4-phased manner. It was carried out in the 6 selected villages from July,2015 to June,2017. The screening for active TB among chest symptomatics is followed as per the guidelines of the (RNTCP) Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program in India.\n\nResultsIn all, 1455 households were surveyed in the 6 tribal dominated villages of 4 districts, namely Balangir, Dhenkanal, Kandhmal and Mayurbhanj. Total population of the villages was 6681. Based on the eligibility, 5144 (97.7%) individuals were screened. About 139 (2.3%) could not be screened due to non-availability in their households during day time. Out of these, 126 chest symptomatic individuals were identified. Sputum samples were collected from these and sent to the National Reference Laboratory, RMRC, Bhubaneswar using public transport and maintaining cold chain. 35 patients were found to be having active TB disease. 18 were culture positive. The prevalence of pulmonary TB is 0.68%. The risk factors seemed to be ignorance about TB symptoms, addiction to alcoholic drinks, difficulty reaching the health facilities owing to the long distances, lack of communication and transport. In addition, other morbidities like Malaria, diabetes, hypertension, malnutrition, etc. were observed in the tribes of the study sites.\n\nConclusionObserved prevalence suggests further strengthening of TB control program. This study is the first of its kind in this State.",

Three studies examined the relationship between confidence and surprise in order to shed light on the psychology of overprecision in judgment.

Results show that more ex-ante confidence produces less ex-post surprise for correct answers; this relationship reverses for incorrect answers.

    "abstract": "G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent a significant target class for pharmaceutical therapies. However, to date, only about 10% of druggable GPCRs have had their structures characterized at atomic resolution. Further, because of the flexibility of GPCRs, alternative conformations remain to be modeled, even after an experimental structure is available. Thus, computational modeling of GPCRs is a crucial component for understanding biological function and to aid development of new therapeutics. Previous single- and multi-template homology modeling protocols in Rosetta often generated non-native-like conformations of transmembrane -helices and/or extracellular loops. Here we present a new Rosetta protocol for modeling GPCRs that is improved in two critical ways: Firstly, it uses a blended sequence- and structure-based alignment that now accounts for structure conservation in extracellular loops. Secondly, by merging multiple template structures into one comparative model, the best possible template for every region of a target GPCR can be used expanding the conformational space sampled in a meaningful way. This new method allows for accurate modeling of receptors using templates as low as 20% sequence identity, which accounts for nearly the entire druggable space of GPCRs. A model database of all non-odorant GPCRs is made available at www.rosettagpcr.org.\n\nAuthor SummaryStructure-based drug discovery is among the new technologies driving the development of next generation therapeutics. Inherent to this process is the availability of a protein structure for virtual screening. The most heavily drugged protein family, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), however suffers from a lack of experimental structures that could hinder drug development. Technical challenges prevent the determination of every protein structure, so we turn to computational modeling to predict the structures of the remaining proteins. Again, traditional techniques fail due to the high divergence of this family. Here, we build on available methods specifically for the challenge of modeling GPCRs. This new method outperforms other methods and allows for the ability to accurately model nearly 90% of the entire GPCR family. We therefore generate a model database of all GPCRs (www.rosettagpcr.org) for use in future drug development.",

    "abstract": "Cytokinesis is the final stage of the cell cycle which separates cellular constituents to produce two daughter cells. Using Schizosaccharomyces pombe we have investigated the role of various classes of proteins involved in this process. Central to these is anillin/Mid1p which forms a ring-like structure at the cell equator that predicts the site of cell separation through septation in fission yeast. Here we demonstrate a direct physical interaction between Mid1p and the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-associated protein Vps4p. The interaction is essential for cell viability, and Vps4p is required for the correct cellular localization of Mid1p. Furthermore, we show that Mid1p is phosphorylated by the aurora kinase Aurora A, that the interaction of mid1 and ark1 genes is essential for cell viability, and that Ark1p is also required for the correct cellular localization of Mid1p. We mapped the sites of phosphorylation of Mid1p by Aurora A and the polo kinase Plk1 and assessed their importance by mutational analysis. Mutational analysis revealed S332, S523 and S531 to be required for Mid1p function and its interaction with Vps4p, Ark1p and Plo1p. Combined our data suggest a physical interaction between Mip1p and Vps4p important for cytokinesis, and identify phosphorylation of Mid1p by aurora and polo kinases as being significant for this process.\n\nAuthor summaryReplication is a property of all living cells, with cell separation, so-called cytokinesis, the final step in the process. A large number of proteins have been identified that are required for cytokinesis, but in many cases it is not understand how they interact and regulate each other. In this research we have analysed two classes of proteins founds in all eukaryotic cells with central roles in cytokinesis: the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) proteins and the anillin protein Mid1p. We identify a direct physical interaction between the ESCRT protein Vps4 and anillin/Mid1p, and explore how it regulates cytokinesis. Midp1 activity is shown to controlled by the protein kinase Ark1p by direct phosphorylation, and this phosphorylation is important for Mid1p function. These observations identify new ways in which ESCRT and anillin/Mid1p control cell separation.",

Estimating larval densities through collection of post-emergent exuvia can be a practical and time efficient alternative. We evaluated the use of multiple pass depletion techniques of the post-emergent exuvia of Pteronarcys californica to estimate larval densities at ten sites in three Colorado rivers. Exuvia density was highly correlated with both final-instar larval density (R2 = 0.90) and total larval density (R2 = 0.88) and the multiple pass removal technique performed well. Exuvia surveys found P. californica at three low density sites where benthic sampling failed to detect it. At moderate and high density sites the exuvia surveys always produced lower density estimates than benthic surveys. Multiple pass depletion estimates of exuvia proved to be an accurate and efficient technique at estimating larval densities and provided an effective alternative for traditional benthic sampling when objectives are monitoring P. californica and detecting populations, especially at low density sites.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNew sensitive techniques have revealed a large population of bacteria in the human urinary tract, challenging the perception of the urine of healthy humans being sterile. While the role of this urinary microbiota is unknown, dysbiosis has been linked to disorders like urgency urinary incontinence and interstitial cystitis. When comparing studies it is crucial to account for possible confounders introduced due to methodological differences. Here we investigated whether storage condition or time of collection, had any impact on the urinary microbial composition.\n\nResultsFor comparison of different storage conditions, urine was collected from five healthy adult female donors, and analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Using the same methods, the daily or day-to-day variation in urinary microbiota was investigated in nineteen healthy donors, including four women, five men, five girls, and five boys. With the exception of two male adult donors, none of the tested conditions gave rise to significant differences in alpha and beta diversities between individuals. Conclusion: The composition of the urinary microbiota was found to be highly resilient to changes introduced by storage temperature and duration. In addition, we did not observe any intrapersonal daily or day-to-day variations in microbiota composition in women, girls or boys.\n\nTogether our study supports flexibility in study design, when conducting urinary microbiota studies.\n\nAuthor summaryThe discovery of bacteria native to the urinary tract in healthy people, a location previously believed to be sterile, has prompted research into the clinical potential of these bacteria. However, methodological weaknesses can significantly influence such studies, and thus development of robust techniques for investigating these bacteria are needed. In the present study, we investigated whether differences in storage following collection, could affect the bacterial composition of urine samples. Next, we investigated if this composition exhibited daily or day-to-day variations.\n\nFirstly, we found, that the bacterial composition of urine could be maintained by storage at -80 {degrees}C, -20 {degrees}C, or refrigerated at 4 {degrees}C. Secondly, the bacterial composition of urine remained stable over time. Overall, the results of this study provide information important to study design in future investigations into the clinical implications of urinary bacteria.",

During this period, 662.3h of boat-based photo-identification survey effort was carried out, and the sighting histories of 817 identified individuals were used to estimate abundance using mark-recapture modelling. The selected open population model (POPAN) provided an estimate of 2,295 individuals (95% CI: 1,157-4,553) for the entire study area. A model estimate was produced for a subset of the study area, Plettenberg Bay, which could be compared with a past estimate for this location (2002-2003). The comparison suggested a 72.3% decrease in abundance, from 6,997 (95% CI: 5,230-9,492) in 2002-2003 to 1,940 (95% CI: 1,448-2,600) in 2014-2016. The decline in abundance was supported by a 72% reduction in mean group size for Plettenberg Bay between the periods. It is essential to be able to assess abundance changes at other locations to inform revision of T. aduncus conservation status in South Africa.",
