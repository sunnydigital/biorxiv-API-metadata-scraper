    "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms for repairing DNA damages and point mutations have been well understood but it remains unclear how a frameshift mutation is repaired. Here we report that frameshift reversion occurs in E. coli more frequently than expected and appears to be a targeted gene repair signaled by premature termination codons (PTCs), producing high-level variations in the repaired genes. Genome resequencing shows that the revertant genome is highly stable, and the single-molecule variations in the repaired genes are derived from RNA editing. A multi-omics analysis shows that the expression levels change greatly in most the DNA and RNA manipulating genes. DNA replication, transcription, RNA editing, RNA degradation, nucleotide excision repair, mismatch repair, and homologous recombination were upregulated in the frameshift or revertant, but the base excision repair was not. Moreover, genes and transposons in a duplicate region silenced in wild type E. coli were activated in the frameshift. Finally, we propose a nonsense-mediated gene revising (NMGR) model for frame repair, which also acts as a driving force for molecular evolution. In essence, nonsense mRNAs are recognized, edited, and transported to template the repair of the coding gene by RNA-directed DNA repair, nucleotide excision, mismatch repair, and homologous recombination. Thanks to NMGR, the mutation rate temporarily rises in a frameshift gene, bringing genetic diversity while repairing the frameshift mutation and accelerating the evolution process without a high mutation rate in the genome.",

    "abstract": "Although three-dimensional (3D) fluorescence microscopy is an essential tool for life science research, the fundamentally-limited optical throughput, as reflected in the compromise between speed and resolution, so far prevents further movement towards faster, clearer, and higher-throughput applications. We herein report a dual-stage mutual-feedback deep-learning approach that allows gradual reversion of microscopy degradation from high-resolution targets to low-resolution images. Using a single blurred-and-pixelated 3D image as input, our trained network infers a 3D output with notably higher resolution and improved contrast. The performance is better than conventional 1-stage network approaches. It pushes the throughput limit of current 3D fluorescence microscopy in three ways: notably reducing the acquisition time for accurate mapping of large organs, breaking the diffraction limit for imaging subcellular events with faster lower-toxicity measurement, and improving temporal resolution for capturing instantaneous biological processes. Combining our network approach with light-sheet fluorescence microscopy, we demonstrate the imaging of vessels and neurons in the mouse brain at single-cell resolution and with a throughput of 6 minutes for a whole brain. We also image cell organelles beyond the diffraction limit at a 2-Hz volume rate, and map neuronal activities of freely-moving C. elegans at single-cell resolution and 30-Hz volume rate.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria occupy all major ecosystems and maintain an intensive relationship to the eukaryotes, developing together into complex biomes (i.e., phycosphere and rhizosphere). Interactions between eukaryotes and bacteria range from cooperative to competitive, with the associated microorganisms affecting their hosts development, growth, health and disease. Since the advent of non-culture dependent analytical techniques such as metagenome sequencing, consortia have been described but owing to the complex interactions rarely functionally dissected. Multifaceted analysis of the microbial consortium of the ancient phytoplankton Botryococcus as an attractive model food web revealed that its all abundant bacterial members belong to a distinct niche of biotin auxotrophs, essentially depending on the microalga. In addition, hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria without vitamin auxotrophies, which adversely affect the algal cell morphology, appear evidently decimated. Synthetic rearrangement of a minimal community consisting of alga, mutualistic and parasitic bacteria underpins the model of a eukaryote that domesticates its own mutualistic bacterial \"zoo\" to manipulate and control its surrounding biosphere. This model of domestication of mutualistic bacteria for the defense against destruents by a eukaryotic host could represent ecologically relevant interactions that cross species boundaries. Metabolic and system reconstruction disentangles the relationships and provide a blueprint for the construction of mutually beneficial synthetic ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Genome editing via the homology-directed repair (HDR) pathway in somatic plant cells is very inefficient compared to error-prone repair by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). Here, we increased HDR-based genome editing efficiency approximately 3-fold compared to a Cas9-based single-replicon system via the use of de novo multi-replicon systems equipped with CRISPR/LbCpf1 in tomato and obtained replicon-free but stable HDR alleles. The efficiency of CRISPR/LbCpf1-based HDR was significantly modulated by physical culture conditions such as temperature and light. Ten days of incubation at 31{degrees}C under a light/dark cycle after Agrobacterium-mediated transformation resulted in the best performance among the tested conditions. Furthermore, we developed our single-replicon system into a multi-replicon system that effectively increased HDR efficiency. Although this approach is still challenging, we showed the feasibility of HDR-based genome editing of a salt-tolerant SlHKT1;2 allele without genomic integration of antibiotic markers or any phenotypic selection. Self-pollinated offspring plants carrying the HKT1;2 HDR allele showed stable inheritance and germination tolerance in the presence of 100 mM NaCl. Our work may pave the way for transgene-free editing of alleles of interest in asexually as well as sexually reproducing plants.",

Photosynthetic light harvesting and reaction centre proteins from both groups of organisms have been exploited in a wide range of biohybrid devices for solar energy conversion, solar fuel synthesis and a variety of sensing technologies, but the energy harvesting abilities of these devices are limited by each proteins individual palette of (bacterio)chlorophyll, carotenoid and bilin pigments. In this work we demonstrate a range of genetically-encoded, self-assembling photosystems in which recombinant plant light harvesting complexes are covalently locked with reaction centres from a purple photosynthetic bacterium, producing macromolecular chimeras that display mechanisms of polychromatic solar energy harvesting and conversion not present in natural systems. Our findings illustrate the power of a synthetic biology approach in which bottom-up construction of a novel photosystem using naturally disparate but mechanistically complementary components is achieved in a predictable fashion through the genetic encoding of adaptable, plug-and-play covalent interfaces.\n\nToC image\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=168 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/565283v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (61K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12cc9c3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@172354corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10948b6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@84d88c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe study of the evolutionary history of biological networks enables deep functional understanding of various bio-molecular processes. Network growth models, such as the Duplication-Mutation with Complementarity (DMC) model, provide a principled approach to characterizing the evolution of protein-protein interactions (PPI) based on duplication and divergence. Current methods for model-based ancestral network reconstruction primarily use greedy heuristics and yield sub-optimal solutions.\n\nResultsWe present a new Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solution for maximum likelihood reconstruction of ancestral PPI networks using the DMC model. We prove the correctness of our solution that is designed to find the optimal solution. It can also use efficient heuristics from general-purpose ILP solvers to obtain multiple optimal and near-optimal solutions that may be useful in many applications. Experiments on synthetic data show that our ILP obtains solutions with higher likelihood than those from previous methods, and is robust to noise and model mismatch. We evaluate our algorithm on two real PPI networks, with proteins from the families of bZIP transcription factors and the Commander complex. On both the networks, solutions from our ILP have higher likelihood and are in better agreement with independent biological evidence from other studies.\n\nAvailabilityA Python implementation is available at https://bitbucket.org/cdal/.\n\nContactvaibhav.rajan@nus.edu.sg",

However it is not clear how these mechanisms form by trial and error learning. In this paper we present an initial effort to characterize the population activity in monkey prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC) during the learning phase of a paired-associate task. To analyze the population data, we introduce the normalized distance, a dimensionless metric that describes the encoding of cognitive variables from the geometrical relationship among neural trajectories in state space. It is found that PFC exhibits a more sustained encoding of task-relevant variables whereas HPC only transiently encodes the identity of the stimuli. We also found partial evidence on the learning-dependent changes for some of the task variables. This study shows the feasibility of using normalized distance as a metric to characterize and compare population level encoding of task variables, and suggests further directions to explore the learning-dependent changes in the population activity.",

    "abstract": "Polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMNs) are indispensable for controlling life-threatening fungal infections. In addition to various effector mechanisms, PMNs also produce extracellular vesicles (EVs). Their contribution to antifungal defense has remained unexplored. We reveal that the clinically important human pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus triggers PMNs to release a distinct set of antifungal EVs (afEVs). Proteome analyses indicated that afEVs are enriched in antimicrobial proteins. The cargo and release kinetics of EVs are modulated by the fungal strain confronted. Tracking of afEVs indicated that they associated with fungal cells and even entered fungal hyphae, resulting in alterations in the morphology of the fungal cell wall and dose-dependent antifungal effects. Two human proteins enriched in afEVs, cathepsin G and azurocidin, were heterologously expressed in fungal hyphae, which led to reduced fungal growth relative to a control retinol binding protein 7 producing strain. In conclusion, the production of afEVs by PMNs offers an intriguing, previously overlooked mechanism of antifungal defense against A. fumigatus.\n\nImportanceInvasive fungal infections caused by the mold Aspergillus fumigatus are a growing concern in the clinic due to the increasing use of immunosuppressive therapies and increasing antifungal drug resistance. These infections result in high mortality as treatment and diagnostic options remain limited. In healthy individuals, neutrophilic granulocytes are critical for elimination of A. fumigatus from the host; however, the exact extracellular mechanism of neutrophil-mediated antifungal activity remains unresolved. Here, we present a mode of antifungal defense employed by human neutrophils against A. fumigatus not previously described. We find that extracellular vesicles produced by neutrophils in response to A. fumigatus infection are able to associate with the fungus, limit growth, and elicit cell damage by delivering antifungal cargo. In the end, antifungal extracellular vesicle biology provides a significant step forward in our understanding of A. fumigatus host pathogenesis and opens up novel diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities.",

    "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is accompanied by severe energy deprivation and extensive epigenetic changes. However, how energy metabolism and chromatin modifications are interlinked during MI and heart repair has been poorly explored. Here, we examined the effect of different carbon sources that involved in the major metabolic pathways of acetyl-CoA synthesis on myocardial infarction and found that elevation of acetyl-CoA significantly improved heart function in I/R rats by administration of sodium octanoate (8C). Mechanistically, 8C prevented I/R injury by promoting histone acetylation which in turn activated the expression of antioxidant genes HO1, NQO1 and SOD2 and inhibited cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Furthermore, we identified that 8C-promoted histone acetylation and heart repair were carried out by metabolic enzyme medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) and histone acetyltransferase Kat2a. Therefore, our results demonstrate that 8C dramatically improves cardiac function through metabolic acetyl-CoA-mediated histone acetylation. This study uncovers an interlinked metabolic/epigenetic network comprising 8C, acetyl-CoA, MCAD, and Kat2a in stimulating histone acetylation and anti-oxidative stress gene expression to combat heart injury.",

Changes in the object representation along a hierarchical sensory system are associated with changes in the geometry of those manifolds, and recent theoretical progress connects this geometry with classification capacity, a quantitative measure of the ability to support object classification. Deep neural networks trained on object classification tasks are a natural testbed for the applicability of this relation. We show how classification capacity improves along the hierarchies of deep neural networks with different architectures. We demonstrate that changes in the geometry of the associated object manifolds underlie this improved capacity, and shed light on the functional roles different levels in the hierarchy play to achieve it, through orchestrated reduction of manifolds radius, dimensionality and inter-manifold correlations.",

    "abstract": "O_LIComplex networks have been useful to link experimental data with mechanistic models, and have become widely used across many scientific disciplines. Recently, the increasing amount and complexity of data, particularly in biology, has prompted the development of multidimensional networks, where dimensions reflect the multiple qualitative properties of nodes, links, or both. As a consequence, traditional quantities computed in single dimensional networks should be adapted to incorporate this new information. A particularly important problem is the detection of communities, namely sets of nodes sharing certain properties, which reduces the complexity of the networks, hence facilitating its interpretation.\nC_LIO_LIIn this work, we propose an operative definition of \"function\" for the nodes in multidimensional networks, and we exploit this definition to show that it is possible to detect two types of communities: i) modules, which are communities more densely connected within their members than with nodes belonging to other communities, and ii) guilds, which are sets of nodes connected with the same neighbours, even if they are not connected themselves. We provide two quantities to optimally detect both types of communities, whose relative values reflect their importance in the network.\nC_LIO_LIThe flexibility of the method allowed us to analyze different ecological examples encompassing mutualistic, trophic and microbial networks. We showed that by considering both metrics we were able to obtain deeper ecological insights about how these different ecological communities were structured. The method mapped pools of species with properties that were known in advance, such as plants and pollinators. Other types of communities found, when contrasted with external data, turned out to be ecologically meaningful, allowing us to identify species with important functional roles or the influence of environmental variables. Furthermore, we found the method was sensitive to community-level topological properties like the nestedness.\nC_LIO_LIIn ecology there is often a need to identify groupings including trophic levels, guilds, functional groups, or ecotypes.The method is therefore important in providing an objective means of distinguishing modules and guilds. The method we developed, functionInk (functional linkage), is computationally efficient at handling large multidimensional networks since it does not require optimization procedures or tests of robustness.

In this study, we investigated the effects of hepatitis C virus clearance on markers of systemic inflammation measured in plasma samples from CHC patients before, during and after DAA therapy. We identified a plasma soluble protein profile associated with CHC. Successful DAA therapy rapidly normalised the plasma inflammatory milieu, with the notable exception of soluble (s) CD163, a marker of macrophage activation, which remained elevated after viral clearance and segregated patients with high and low levels of cirrhosis. Patients who received DAA in combination with Ribavirin maintained elevated levels of CXCL10, consistent with an immune-stimulatory role of Ribavirin. As anticipated, DAA-treated patients experienced durable improvement in liver fibrosis measurements. Interestingly, pre-treatment levels of fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) were inversely associated with reduction of APRI and FIB-4 scores during treatment. Together, these results support the notion of a rapid restoration of many aspects of the inflammatory state in CHC patients in response to DAA therapy. Furthermore, the associations with sCD163 and FABP4 warrants further investigation into the role of macrophages in residual liver disease and fibrosis resolution after viral clearance.",

    "abstract": "The nitrogenase metalloenzyme family, essential for supplying fixed nitrogen to the biosphere, is one of lifes key biogeochemical innovations. The three isozymes of nitrogenase differ in their metal dependence, each binding either a FeMo-, FeV-, or FeFe-cofactor where the reduction of dinitrogen takes place. The history of nitrogenase metal dependence has been of particular interest due to the possible implication that ancient marine metal availabilities have significantly constrained nitrogenase evolution over geologic time. Here, we reconstructed the evolutionary history of nitrogenases, and combined phylogenetic reconstruction, ancestral sequence inference, and structural homology modeling to evaluate the potential metal dependence of ancient nitrogenases. We find that active-site sequence features can reliably distinguish extant Mo-nitrogenases from V- and Fe-nitrogenases, and that inferred ancestral sequences at the deepest nodes of the phylogeny suggest these ancient proteins most resemble modern Mo-nitrogenases. Taxa representing early-branching nitrogenase lineages lack one or more biosynthetic nifE and nifN genes that both contribute to the assembly of the FeMo-cofactor in studied organisms, suggesting that early Mo-nitrogenases may have utilized an alternate and/or simplified pathway for cofactor biosynthesis. Our results underscore the profound impacts that protein-level innovations likely had on shaping global biogeochemical cycles throughout the Precambrian, in contrast to organism-level innovations that characterize the Phanerozoic Eon.",

    "abstract": "Prior knowledge can help observers in various situations. Adults can simultaneously learn two location priors and integrate these with sensory information to locate hidden objects. Importantly, observers weight prior and sensory (likelihood) information differently depending on their respective reliabilities, in line with principles of Bayesian inference. Yet, there is limited evidence that observers actually perform Bayesian inference, rather than a heuristic, such as forming a look-up table. To distinguish these possibilities, we ask whether previously-learnt priors will be immediately integrated with a new, untrained likelihood. If observers use Bayesian principles, they should immediately put less weight on the new, less reliable, likelihood (\"Bayesian transfer\"). In an initial experiment, observers estimated the position of a hidden target, drawn from one of two distinct distributions, using sensory and prior information. The sensory cue consisted of dots drawn from a Gaussian distribution centred on the true location with either low, medium, or high variance; the latter introduced after block three of five to test for evidence of Bayesian transfer. Observers did not weight the cue (relative to the prior) significantly less in the high compared to medium variance condition, counter to Bayesian predictions. However, when explicitly informed of the different prior variabilities, observers placed less weight on the new high variance likelihood (\"Bayesian transfer\"), yet substantially diverged from ideal. Much of this divergence can be captured by a model that weights sensory information, according only to internal noise in using the cue. These results emphasise the limits of Bayesian models in complex tasks.",

    "abstract": "Regulatory authorities require animal toxicity tests for new chemical entities. Organ weight changes are accepted as a sensitive indicator of chemically induced organ damage, but can be difficult to interpret because changes in organ weight might reflect chemically-induced changes in overall body weight. A common solution is to calculate the relative organ weight (organ to body weight ratio), but this inadequately controls for the dependence on body weight - a point made by statisticians for decades, but which has not been widely adopted. The recommended solution is an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), but it is rarely used, possibly because both the method of statistical correction and the interpretation of the output may be unclear to those with minimal statistical training. Using relative organ weights can easily lead to incorrect conclusions, resulting in poor decisions, wasted resources, and an ethically questionable use of animals. We propose to cast the problem into a causal modelling framework as it directly assesses questions of scientific interest, the results are easy to interpret, and the analysis is simple to perform with freely available software. Furthermore, by taking a Bayesian approach we can model unequal variances, control for multiple testing, and directly provide evidence of safety.",

    "abstract": "The explore-exploit dilemma describes the trade off that occurs any time we must choose between exploring unknown options and exploiting options we know well. Implicit in this trade off is how we value future rewards -- exploiting is usually better in the short term, but in the longer term the benefits of exploration can be huge. Thus, in theory there should be a tight connection between how much people value future rewards, i.e. how much they discount future rewards relative to immediate rewards, and how likely they are to explore, with less  temporal discounting associated with more exploration. By measuring individual differences in temporal discounting and correlating them with explore-exploit behavior, we tested whether this theoretical prediction holds in practice. We used the 27-item Delay-Discounting Questionnaire to estimate temporal discounting and the Horizon Task to quantify two strategies of explore-exploit behavior: directed exploration, where information drives exploration by choice, and random exploration, where behavioral variability drives exploration by chance. We find a clear correlation between temporal discounting and directed exploration, with more temporal discounting leading to less directed exploration. Conversely, we find no relationship between temporal discounting and random exploration. Unexpectedly, we find that the relationship with directed exploration appears to be driven by a correlation between temporal discounting and uncertainty seeking at short time horizons, rather than information seeking at long horizons. Taken together our results suggest a nuanced relationship between temporal discounting and explore-exploit behavior that may be mediated by multiple factors.",

Here, we report that neutralization of IL-2 abrogated all IL-2 receptor signaling in Treg cells, resulting in rapid dendritic cell (DC) activation and subsequent Teff cell proliferation. By contrast, despite substantially reduced IL-2 sensitivity, Treg cells maintained selective IL-2 signaling and prevented immune dysregulation following treatment with the inhibitory anti-CD25 antibody PC61, even when CD25hi Treg cells were depleted. Thus, despite severely curtailed CD25 expression and function, Treg cells retain selective access to IL-2 that supports their anti-inflammatory functions in vivo. Antibody-mediated targeting of CD25 is being actively pursued for treatment of autoimmune disease and preventing allograft rejection, and our findings help inform therapeutic manipulation and design for optimal patient outcomes.",

While PHB depletion shortens lifespan of wild type animals, it enhances longevity of a plethora of metabolically compromised mutants, including target of rapamycin complex 2 (TORC2) mutants sgk-1 and rict-1. Here, we show that sgk-1 mutants have impaired mitochondrial homeostasis, lipogenesis, yolk formation and autophagy flux due to alterations in membrane lipid and sterol homeostasis. Remarkably, all these features are suppressed by PHB depletion. Lifespan analysis shows that autophagy and the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), but not mitophagy, are required for the enhanced longevity caused by PHB depletion in sgk-1 mutants. We hypothesize that UPRmt induction upon PHB depletion extends lifespan of sgk-1 mutants through autophagy. Our results strongly suggest that PHB depletion suppresses the autophagy defects of sgk-1 mutants by altering membrane lipid composition at ER-mitochondria contact sites, where TORC2 localizes.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveSudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of mortality in patients in patients with intractable epilepsy. However, the pathogenesis of SUDEP seems to be poorly understood. Our previous findings showed that the incidence of seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) was markedly reduced by atomoxetine in a murine SUDEP model. Because the central NE -1 receptor (NE-1R) plays a vital role in regulating respiratory function, we hypothesized that the suppression of S-IRA by atomoxetine was mediated by NE/NE-1R interactions that can be reversed by NE-1R antagonism.\n\nMethodsWe examined whether atomoxetine-mediated suppression of S-IRA evoked by either acoustic stimulation or pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) in DBA/1 mice can be reversed by intraperitoneal (IP) and intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of prazosin, a selective antagonist of NE-1R. The content and activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a rate-limiting enzyme for NE synthesis, in the lower brainstem was measured by ELISA. Electroencephalograms (EEG) were obtained by using the PTZ-evoked SUDEP model.\n\nResultsAtomoxetine-mediated suppression of S-IRA evoked by either acoustic stimulation or PTZ was significantly reversed by low doses of IP and ICV prazosin. Neither repetitive acoustic stimulation nor S-IRA reduced TH levels in lower brainstem. However, the enzyme activity of TH levels in lower brainstem was significantly increased by mechanical ventilation with DBA/1 mice ,which makes dead DBA/1 mice suffered from S-IRA and SUDEP recover. EEG data showed that although the protective effect of atomoxetine was reversed by prazosin, neither drug affected EEG activity.\n\nSignificanceThese data suggest that deficient synthesis of NE and norepinephrinergic neurotransmission contributes to S-IRA and that the NE-1R is a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of SUDEP.",

While U2AF1 S34F-associated splicing alterations have been described, the function of altered mRNA isoform changes remains largely unexplored. To better understand the impact U2AF1 S34F has on isoform fate and function, we conducted high-throughput long-read cDNA sequencing from isogenic human bronchial epithelial cells with and without U2AF1 S34F mutation. We found that nearly 75% (49,366) of our long-read constructed multiexon isoforms do not overlap GENCODE or short-read assembled isoforms. We found 198 transcript isoforms with significant expression and usage changes caused by U2AF1 S34F mutation, including a novel lncRNA. Isoforms from immune-related genes were largely downregulated in mutant cells, none of which were found to have splicing changes. Finally, isoforms likely targeted by nonsense-mediated decay were preferentially downregulated in U2AF1 S34F cells, suggesting that the impact of observed isoform changes may alter the translational output of affected genes. Altogether, long-read sequencing provided additional insights into transcriptome alterations and downstream functional consequences associated with U2AF1 S34F mutation.",

Vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGFC), the ligand for both VEGFR2 and VEGFR3, is a central lymphangiogenic regulator that also drives angiogenesis. Here we report that members of the highly conserved BACH (BTB and CNC homology) family of transcription factors regulate VEGFC expression, through direct binding to its promoter. Accordingly, downregulation of bach2a hinders blood-vessel formation and impairs lymphatic sprouting in a vegfc-dependent manner during zebrafish embryonic development. In contrast, BACH1-overexpression enhances intratumoral blood-vessel density and peritumoral lymphatic vessel diameter in ovarian and lung mouse tumor models. The effects on the vascular compartment correlate spatially and temporally with BACH1 transcriptional regulation of VEGFC expression. Altogether, our results uncover a novel role for the BACH/VEGFC signaling axis in lymphatic formation during embryogenesis and cancer, providing a novel potential target for therapeutic interventions.",

Yet, understanding the fundamental biology of the hBM in health and diseases remain difficult due to complexity of studying or manipulating the BM in humans. Accurate in vitro models of the hBM microenvironment are critical to further our understanding of the BM niche and advancing new clinical interventions. Although, in vitro culture models that recapitulate some key components of the BM niche have been reported, there are no examples of a fully human, in vitro, organoid platform that incorporates the various niches of the hBM - specifically the endosteal, central marrow, and perivascular niches - thus limiting their physiological relevance. Here we report an hBM-on-a-chip that incorporates these three niches in a single micro-physiological device. Osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs produced robust mineralization on the PDMS surface (\"bone layer\") and subsequent seeding of endothelial cells and hMSCs in a hydrogel network (\"central marrow\") created an interconnected vascular network (\"perivascular niche\") on top. We show that this multi-niche hBM accurately mimics the ECM composition, allows hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation and migration, and is affected by radiation. A key finding is that the endosteal niche significantly contributes to hBM physiology. Taken together, this multi-niche micro-physiological system opens up new opportunities in hBM research and therapeutics development, and can be used to better understand hBM physiology, normal and impaired hematopoiesis, and hBM pathologies, including cancer metastasis, multiple myelomas, and BM failures.",

    "abstract": "Identifying change points and/or anomalies in dynamic network structures has become increasingly popular across various domains, from neuroscience to telecommunication to finance. One of the particular objectives of the anomaly detection task from the neuroscience perspective is the reconstruction of the dynamic manner of brain region interactions. However, most statistical methods for detecting anomalies have the following unrealistic limitation for brain studies and beyond: that is, network snapshots at different time points are assumed to be independent. To circumvent this limitation, we propose a distribution-free framework for anomaly detection in dynamic networks. First, we present each network snapshot of the data as a linear object and find its respective univariate characterization via local and global network topological summaries. Second, we adopt a change point detection method for (weakly) dependent time series based on efficient scores, and enhance the finite sample properties of change point method by approximating the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic using the sieve bootstrap. We apply our method to simulated and to real data, particularly, two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data sets and the Enron communication graph. We find that our new method delivers impressively accurate and realistic results in terms of identifying locations of true change points compared to the results reported by competing approaches. The new method promises to offer a deeper insight into the large-scale characterizations and functional dynamics of the brain and, more generally, into intrinsic structure of complex dynamic networks.",

    "abstract": "A hippocampal place cell exhibits multiple firing fields within and across environments. What factors determine the configuration of these fields, and could they be set down in arbitrary locations? We conceptualize place cells as performing evidence combination across many inputs and selecting a threshold to fire. Thus, mathematically they are perceptrons, except that they act on geometrically organized inputs in the form of multiscale periodic grid-cell drive, and external cues. We analytically count which field arrangements a place cell can realize with structured grid inputs, to show that many more place-field arrangements are realizable with grid-like than one-hot coded inputs. However, the arrangements have a rigid structure, defining an underlying response scaffold. We show that the \"separating capacity\" or spatial range over which all potential field arrangements are realizable equals the rank of the grid-like input matrix, which in turn equals the sum of distinct grid periods, a small fraction of the unique grid-cell coding range. Learning different grid-to-place weights beyond this small range will alter previous arrangements, which could explain the volatility of the place code. However, compared to random inputs over the same range, grid-structured inputs generate larger margins, conferring relative robustness to place fields when grid input weights are fixed.\n\nSignificance statementPlace cells encode cognitive maps of the world by combining external cues with an internal coordinate scaffold, but our ability to predict basic properties of the code, including where a place cell will exhibit fields without external cues (the scaffold), remains weak. Here we geometrically characterize the place cell scaffold, assuming it is derived from multiperiodic modular grid cell inputs, and provide exact combinatorial results on the space of permitted field arrangements. We show that the modular inputs permit a large number of place field arrangements, with robust fields, but also strongly constrain their geometry and thus predict a structured place scaffold.",

    "abstract": "An organisms ability to adapt to heat can be key to its survival. Cells adapt to temperature shifts by adjusting lipid desaturation levels and the fluidity of membranes in a process that is thought to be controlled cell autonomously. We have discovered that subtle, step-wise increments in ambient temperature can lead to the conserved heat shock response being activated in head neurons of C. elegans. This response is exactly opposite to the expression of the lipid desaturase FAT-7 in the worms gut. We find that the over-expression of the master regulator of this response, Hsf-1, in head neurons, causes extensive fat remodeling to occur across tissues. These changes include a decrease in FAT-7 expression and a shift in the levels of unsaturated fatty acids in the plasma membrane. These shifts are in line with membrane fluidity requirements to survive in warmer temperatures. We have identified that the cGMP receptor, TAX-2/TAX-4, as well as TGF-{beta}/BMP signaling, as key players in the transmission of neuronal stress to peripheral tissues. This is the first study to suggest that a thermostat-based mechanism can centrally coordinate membrane fluidity in response to warm temperatures across tissues in multicellular animals.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the gene encoding the ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein ZC3H14 result in a non-syndromic form of autosomal recessive intellectual disability. Studies in Drosophila have defined roles for the ZC3H14 ortholog, Nab2 (aka Drosophila Nab2 or dNab2), in axon guidance and memory due in part to interaction with a second RNA-binding protein, the fly Fragile X homolog Fmr1, and coregulation of shared Nab2-Fmr1 target mRNAs. Despite these advances, neurodevelopmental pathways regulated by Nab2 remain poorly defined. Structural defects in Nab2 null brains resemble defects observed upon disruption of the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, which regulates planar orientation of static and motile cells. A kinked bristle phenotype in surviving Nab2 mutant adults additionally suggests a defect in F-actin polymerization and bundling, which is also a PCP-regulated processes. To test for Nab2-PCP genetic interactions, a collection of PCP loss-of-function alleles was screened for modification of a rough-eye phenotype produced by Nab2 overexpression in the eye (GMR-Nab2) and subsequently for modification of Nab2 null phenotypes. Multiple PCP alleles dominantly modify GMR-Nab2 eye roughening and a subset of these alleles also rescue low survival and thoracic bristle kinking in Nab2 zygotic nulls. Moreover, alleles of two X-linked PCP factors, dishevelled (dsh) and {beta} amyloid protein precursor-like (Appl), rescue GMR-Nab2 eye roughening in male progeny derived from hemizygous dsh or Appl mutant fathers, suggesting an additional effect inherited through the male germline. These findings demonstrate a consistent pattern of Nab2-PCP genetic interactions that suggest molecular links between Nab2 and the PCP pathway in the developing eye, wing and germline.",

We present the first de novo reference genome assembly and annotation, with ontogenic and postharvest transcriptome data relating to sulfur assimilation, transport, and utilization. Diverse gene expression patterns related to sulfur metabolism and GSL biosynthesis are present between inbred lines of rocket. A clear pattern of differential expression determines GSL abundance and the formation of hydrolysis products. One breeding line sustained GSL accumulation and hydrolysis product formation throughout storage. Copies of MYB28, SLIM1, SDI1 and ESM1 orthologs have increased and differential expression postharvest, and are associated with GSLs and hydrolysis product formation. Two glucosinolate transporter gene orthologs (GTR2) were found to be associated with increased GSL accumulations.",

    "abstract": "Glutamate-like receptors (GLRs) in plants play an important role in a number of physiological processes, including wound response, stomatal aperture control, seed germination, root development, innate immune responses, pollen tube growth and morphogenesis. GLRs share amino acid sequence similarity with ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) that mediate neurotransmission in the nervous system of vertebrates. In contrast to iGluRs, however, for which numerous full-length structures are available, the structural information about the plant GLRs has been missing. Here we determine crystal structures of Arabidopsis thaliana GLR3.2 ligand-binding domain (LBD) in complex with glycine and methionine to 1.57 and 1.86 [A] resolution, respectively. Our structures show a fold similar to iGluRs, with several secondary structure elements either missing or different. The closed clamshell conformation of GLR3.2 LBD suggests that both glycine and methionine act as agonists. The structures reveal molecular determinants of ligand binding and explain the promiscuity of GLRs ligand activation compared to iGluRs. Structural similarities of LBDs confirm an evolutionary relationship between GLRs and iGluRs and predict common molecular principles of their gating mechanisms that are driven by the bilobed clamshell-like LBDs.",

    "abstract": "1.BackgroundImpaired myelination may contribute to Huntingtons disease (HD) pathogenesis. This study assessed differences in white matter (WM) microstructure between HD patients and controls, and tested whether drumming training stimulates WM remodelling in HD. Furthermore, it examined whether training-induced microstructural changes are related to improvements in motor and cognitive function.\n\nMethodsParticipants undertook two months of drumming exercises. Working memory and executive function were assessed before and after training. Changes in WM microstructure were investigated with diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI)-based metrics, the restricted diffusion signal fraction (Fr) from the composite hindered and restricted model of diffusion (CHARMED) and the macromolecular proton fraction (MPF) from quantitative magnetization transfer (qMT) imaging. WM pathways linking the putamen and the supplementary motor area (SMA-Putamen), and three segments of the corpus callosum (CCI, CCII, CCIII) were studied using deterministic tractography. Baseline MPF differences between patients and controls were assessed with tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS).\n\nResultsMPF was reduced in HD patients compared to controls in the mid-section of the CC in HD subjects at baseline, while a significantly greater change in MPF was detected in HD patients relative to controls in the CCII, CCIII, and the right SMA-putamen post-training. Further, although patients improved their drumming and executive function performance, such improvements did not correlate with microstructural changes.\n\nConclusionsIncreased MPF suggests training-induced myelin changes in HD. Tailored behavioural stimulation may lead to neural benefits in early HD that could be exploited for delaying disease progression.",

    "abstract": "The striatum is postulated to play a role in gating cortical processing during goal-oriented behavior. However, the underlying circuit structure for striatal gating remains unclear. Deviating from previous approaches which typically treat the striatum as a homogenous structure or small compartments, we took a functional connectivity approach that utilizes the entire anatomical space of the caudate nucleus and examined its functional relationship with the cortex and how that relationship changes with age. We defined the topography of the caudate functional connectivity with the rest of the brain using three publicly available resting-state fMRI data samples. There were several key findings. First, our results revealed two stable gradients of connectivity patterns across the caudate: medial-lateral (M-L) and anterior-posterior (A-P) axes, which supports findings in previous anatomical studies of non-human primates that there is more than one organizational principle. Second, the differential connectivity patterns along the caudates M-L gradient were not limited to single structures but rather organized with respect to large-scale neural networks; in particular, networks associated with internal orienting behavior are closely linked to the medial extent of the caudate whereas networks associated with external orienting behavior are closely linked to the lateral extent of the caudate. Third, we found a decrease in the integrity of M-L organization with healthy aging which was associated with age-related changes in behavioral measures of flexible control. In sum, the caudate shows a topographic organization with respect to large-scale networks in the human brain and changes this organization seem to have implications for age-related decline in flexible control of behavior.",

This multi-vesicular release (MVR) occurs at most synapses but its spatiotemporal properties and relation to uni-vesicular release (UVR) are poorly understood. Nanoscale-resolution detection of individual release events in hippocampal boutons revealed a pattern of spatial organization of MVR, which preferentially overlapped with UVR at more central release sites. Pairs of fusion events comprising MVR were also not perfectly synchronized and the earlier event within the pair occurred closer to the active zone (AZ) center. Parallel to this organization, individual release sites had a gradient of release probability extending from the AZ center to periphery. This gradient, and spatial features of MVR, were similarly tightened by buffering intracellular calcium. These observations revealed a heterogeneous landscape of release site properties within individual AZs, which determines the spatiotemporal features of MVR and is controlled by non-uniform calcium elevation across the AZ.",

Such binary-like responses promote robust signaling of the winner in the presence of input ambiguity and neural noise. Here, we show that a  donut-like inhibitory mechanism in which each competing option suppresses all options except itself, is highly effective at generating categorical neural responses. It surpasses motifs of feedback inhibition, recurrent excitation, and divisive normalization invoked frequently in decision-making models. We demonstrate experimentally not only that this mechanism operates in the midbrain spatial selection network in barn owls, but also that it is necessary for categorical signaling by it. The functional pattern of neural inhibition in the midbrain forms an exquisitely structured  multi-holed donut consistent with this networks combinatorial inhibitory function for stimulus selection. Additionally, modeling reveals a generalizable neural implementation of the donut-like motif for categorical selection. Self-sparing inhibition may, therefore, be a powerful circuit module central to categorization.",

Neurite growth depends on non-fusogenic Sec22b-Stx1 SNARE complexes at endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-PM contacts. Here we show that Sec22b interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum lipid transfer proteins Extended-Synaptotagmins (E-Syts) and this interaction depends on the Longin domain of Sec22b. Overexpression of E-Syts stabilizes Sec22b-Stx1 association, whereas silencing of E-Syts has the opposite effect. Overexpression of wild-type E-Syt2, but not mutants unable to transfer lipids or attach to the ER, increase the formation of axonal filopodia and ramification of neurites in developing neurons. This effect is inhibited by a clostridial neurotoxin cleaving Stx1, expression of Sec22b Longin domain and a Sec22b mutant with extended linker between SNARE and transmembrane domains. We conclude that Sec22b-Stx1 ER-PM contact sites contribute to PM expansion by interacting with lipid transfer proteins such as E-Syts.",

Membrane shedding is thought to be key to this repair process, but a detailed view of how the process occurs is still missing. Here we used electron cryotomography to image the ultrastructural details of plasma membrane wound healing. We found that filopodia-like protrusions are built at damage sites, accompanied by retraction of neighboring filopodia, and that these repurposed protrusions act as scaffolds for membrane shedding. This suggests a new role for filopodia as reservoirs of membrane and actin for plasma membrane damage repair. Damage-induced shedding was dependent on F-actin dynamics and Myo1a, as well as Vps4B, an important component of the ESCRT machinery. Thus we find that damage shedding is more complex than current models of simple vesiculation from flat membrane domains. Rather, we observe structural similarities between damage-mediated shedding and constitutive shedding from enterocytes that argue for conservation of a general membrane shedding mechanism.",

The distribution of these inputs in cortical depth remains under debate. By measuring the calcium activities of LGN axons in V1 of awake mice, we systematically mapped their functional and structural properties. Although both types distributed evenly across cortical depth, we found that they differ significantly across multiple modalities. Compared to the location-sensitive axons, which possessed confined spatial receptive fields, the motion-sensitive axons lacked spatial receptive fields, preferred lower temporal, higher spatial frequencies and had wider horizontal bouton spread. Furthermore, the motion-sensitive axons showed a strong depth-dependent motion direction bias while the location-sensitive axons showed a depth-independent OFF dominance. Overall, our results suggest a new model of receptive biases and laminar structure of thalamic inputs to V1.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=177 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/888156v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (30K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@35c887org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1001d54org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8585b2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c8a35_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "According to Haldanes rule, sex chromosomes should harbour more incompatibilities than autosomes. As a consequence, transmission of sex-linked genes across a genetic barrier is expected to be hampered. A remarkable example of a contradiction of this assumption was reported from the hybrid zone between two house mouse subspecies in western Czechia and south-eastern Germany where unidirectional east[-&gt;]west Y chromosome introgression was observed. Since the phenomenon was coupled with differences in sex ratio, this was hypothesised to be caused by a genetic conflict between sex-specific genes on sex chromosomes or elsewhere in the genome. Here we capitalise on a large material consisting of almost 7500 mice collected across a vast area from the Baltic Sea to the Alps embracing a ~900 km long portion of the zone with the aim to (i) detect its exact course and (ii) reveal the extent and pattern of the Y chromosome introgression in Central Europe. We show that the path of the zone is quite tortuous even at the global scale and the introgression is rather a rule than an exception. We also show that although sex ratio perturbations described in our previous study appear also in other introgression areas, they may not be ubiquitous. Finally, we reveal that although not all Y chromosome types are associated with the introgression, it is not restricted to a single  winning haplotype.",

    "abstract": "In early autoimmune neuroinflammation, interferon (IFN){gamma} and its upregulation of the immunoproteasome (iP) is pathologic. However, during chronic multiple sclerosis (MS), IFN{gamma} has protective properties and, the role of the iP remains to be fully elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that IFN{gamma} signaling in regional astrocytes induces the iP and protects the CNS during autoimmunity. In MS tissue, iP expression was enhanced in spinal cord compared to brainstem lesions, which correlated with a decrease in oxidative stress. In vitro, IFN{gamma} stimulation enhanced iP expression, reduced reactive oxygen species burden, and decreased oxidatively damaged and poly-ubiquitinated protein accumulation preferentially in human spinal cord astrocytes, which was abrogated with the use of the iP inhibitor, ONX 0914. During the chronic phase of an MS animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), ONX 0914 treatment exacerbated disease and led to increased oxidative stress and poly-ubiquitinated protein build-up. Finally, mice with astrocyte-specific loss of the IFN{gamma} receptor exhibited worsened chronic EAE associated with reduced iP expression, enhanced lesion size and oxidative stress and poly-ubiquitinated protein accumulation in astrocytes. Taken together, our data reveal a protective role for IFN{gamma} in chronic neuroinflammation and identify a novel function of the iP in astrocytes during CNS autoimmunity.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWOptimality analysis has recently been proposed for value-based decision-making, in which decision agents are rewarded by the value of the selected option. This contrasts with psychophysics where decision agents are typically rewarded only if they choose the  correct or best option. The analysis of optimal policies for value-based decisions raises interesting and surprising parallels with decision rules proposed for accuracy-based decisions in binary and multi-alternative cases, and explains experimentally-observed deviations from rationality. However, the analysis assumes that decision agents should treat time as a linear cost, and thus optimise their Bayes Risk from decisions. A more naturalistic assumption is that future rewards are geometrically discounted, since they are less likely to be realised in an uncertain world. Changing the way in which time is costed leads to substantive changes in the resulting optimal policies, explains empirical data that previously could not be explained, and makes falsifiable predictions for future experiments.",

The VNC harbors neuronal circuits required for the execution of vital behaviors, such as flying and walking. Taking advantage of the lineage-based functional organization of the VNC and genetic tools we developed, we investigated the molecular and developmental basis of behavior by focusing on lineage-specific functions of the homeodomain transcription factor, Unc-4. We found that Unc-4 functions in lineage 11A to promote cholinergic neurotransmitter identity and suppress the GABA fate. In 7B lineage, Unc-4 promotes proper neuronal projections to the leg neuropil, the hub for leg-related neuronal circuits and a specific flight-related take-off behavior. We also uncovered that Unc-4 acts peripherally to promote the development of proprioceptive sense organs and the abilities of flies to execute specific leg-related behaviors such as walking, climbing, and grooming. Our findings, thus, initiates the work on revealing molecular and developmental events that shape the VNC related behaviors.",

The inadequacy of this simplification is highlighted by recent studies that have taken multiple measures of conditioned behavior: Different measures of conditioned behavior provide the basis for drawing opposite conclusions about VCS-US. Here, we develop a simple model involving reciprocal associations between the CS and US (VCS-US and VUS-CS) that simulates these qualitative individual differences in conditioned behavior. The new model, HeiDI (How excitation and inhibition Determine Ideo-motion), enables a broad range of phenomena to be accommodated, which are either beyond the scope of extant models or require them to appeal to additional (learning) processes. It also provides an impetus for new lines of inquiry and generates novel predictions.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinsons disease, the most vulnerable neurons are found in the ventral tier of the substantia nigra (SN), while the adjacent dopamine (DA) neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are mostly spared. Although a significant subset of adult VTA DA neurons expresses Vglut2, a vesicular glutamate transporter, and release glutamate as a second neurotransmitter in the striatum, only very few adult SN DA neurons have this capacity. Previous work has demonstrated that lesions created by neurotoxins such as MPTP and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) can upregulate the expression of Vglut2 in surviving DA neurons. Currently, the molecular mechanisms explaining the plasticity of Vglut2 expression in DA neurons are unknown, as are the physiological consequences for DA neuron function and survival. Here we aimed to characterize the developmental expression pattern of Vglut2 in DA neurons and the role of this transporter in post-lesional plasticity in these neurons. Using an intersectional genetic lineage-mapping approach, based on Vglut2-Cre and TH-Flpo drivers, we first found that more than 98% of DA neurons expressed Vglut2 at some point in their embryonic development. Expression of this transporter was detectable in most DA neurons until E11.5 and was found to be localized in developing axons. Moderate enhancement of VGLUT2 expression in primary DA neurons caused an increase in axonal arborization length. Compatible with a developmental role, constitutive deletion of Vglut2 caused a regional defect in TH-innervation of the dorsal striatum in E18.5 embryos. Moreover, using an in vitro neurotoxin model, we demonstrate that Vglut2 expression can be upregulated in post-lesional DA neurons by 2.5-fold, arguing that the developmental expression of Vglut2 in DA neurons can be reactivated at postnatal stages and contribute to post-lesional plasticity of dopaminergic axons. In support of this hypothesis, we find fewer mesostriatial dopaminergic projections in the striatum of conditional Vglut2 KO mice 7 weeks after a neurotoxic lesion, compared to control animals. Thus, we propose here that one of the functions of Vglut2 in adult DA neurons is to promote post-lesional recovery of meso-striatal axons.",

    "abstract": "Plants emit high rates of methanol (meOH), generally assumed to derive from pectin demethylation, and this increases during abiotic stress. In contrast, less is known about the emission and source of acetic acid (AA). In this study, Populus trichocarpa (California poplar) leaves in different developmental stages were desiccated and quantified for total meOH and AA emissions together with bulk cell wall acetylation and methylation content. While young leaves showed high emissions of meOH (140 mol m-2) and AA (42 mol m-2), emissions were reduced in mature (meOH: 69%, AA: 60%) and old (meOH: 83%, AA: 76%) leaves. In contrast, the ratio of AA/meOH emissions increased with leaf development (young: 35%, mature: 43%, old: 82%), mimicking the pattern of O-acetyl/methyl ester ratios of leaf bulk cell walls (young: 35%, mature: 38%, old: 51%), which is driven by an increase in O-acetyl and decrease in methyl ester content with age. The results are consistent with meOH and AA emission sources from cell wall de-esterification, with young expanding tissues producing highly methylated pectin that is progressively demethyl-esterified. We highlight the quantification of AA/meOH emission ratios as a potential tool for rapid phenotype screening of structural carbohydrate esterification patterns.",

A search of papers on viral vectors RNAi, CRISPR/Cas, TALENs, ZFNs and meganucleases was carried out in the Web of Science. A citation network of 16,746 papers was constructed. An analysis of network clustering combined with text mining was performed. In the case of viral vectors a long term process of incremental innovation in which the clusters of papers are organized around specific improvements of clinical relevance was identified. The most influential investigations on viral vectors were conducted in the United States and the European Union where the main funders were government agencies. The trajectory of RNAi research included clusters related to the study of RNAi as a biological phenomenon and its use in functional genomics, biomedicine and pest control. A British philanthropic organization and a US pharmaceutical company played a key role in the development of basic RNAi research and clinical application respectively, in addition to government agencies and academic institutions. In the case of CRISPR/Cas research, basic science discoveries led to the development of technical improvements, and these two in turn provided the information required for the development of biomedical, agricultural, livestock and industrial applications. The trajectory of CRISPR/Cas research exhibits a geopolitical division of the investigation efforts between the US, as the main producer of basic research and technical improvements, and China increasingly leading the applied research. A set of philanthropic foundations played a key role in specific stages of the CRISPR/Cas research. Our results reflect a change in the model in the financing of science and the emergence of China as a scientific superpower, with implications for the trajectory of development for applications of genomic technologies.",

Our screen identified NUMA1-mutations as the most significant inducer of PTC-318 cell death resistance. Independent validations on NUMA1-proficient HAP1 and non-small cell lung cancer cell lines exposed to BMI1 inhibition by PTC-318 or BMI1 knockdown resulted in cell death following mitotic arrest. Interestingly, cells with CRISPR-Cas9 derived NUMA1 knockout also showed a mitotic arrest phenotype following BMI1 inhibition but, contrary to cells with wildtype NUMA1, these cells were resistant to BMI1-dependent cell death. The current study brings new insights to BMI1 inhibition-induced mitotic lethality in cancer cells and presents a previously unknown role for NUMA1 in this process.",

    "abstract": "Sensory experience during a critical period alters sensory cortical responses and organization. We find that the earliest sound driven activity in the mouse auditory cortex (ACX) starts before ear-canal opening (ECO). Effects of auditory experience before ECO on ACX development are unknown. We find that mouse ACX subplate neurons (SPNs), crucial in thalamocortical maturation, respond to sounds before ECO showing oddball selectivity. Before ECO, SPNs are more selective to oddball sounds in auditory streams than thalamo-recipient layer 4 (L4) neurons and not after ECO. We hypothesize that SPNs oddball selectivity can direct development of L4 responses before ECO. Exposing mice before ECO with a rarely occurring tone in a stream of another tone occurring frequently leads to the strengthening of the adult cortical representation of the rare tone, but not that of the frequent tone. Results of control exposure experiments at multiple developmental windows and also with only a single tone corroborate the observations. A computational network model of known thalamic inputs to SPNs and L4 explains the observed developmental plasticity. Information-theoretic analysis with sparse coding assumptions also predicts the observations. Thus, salient low probability sounds in the earliest auditory environment cause long term changes in the ACX.",

    "abstract": "Interpretations of elevated blood levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) for drug-induced liver injury often assume that the biomarker is released passively from dying cells. However, the mechanisms driving that release have not been explored experimentally. The usefulness of ALT and related biomarkers will improve by developing mechanism-based explanations of elevated levels that can be expanded and elaborated incrementally. We provide the means to challenge the ability of closely related concretized model mechanisms to generate patterns of simulated hepatic injury and ALT release that scale (or not) to be quantitatively similar to the wet-lab validation targets. The validation targets for this work are elevated measures of plasma ALT following acetaminophen (APAP) exposure in mice. We build on a published model mechanism that helps explain the generation of characteristic spatiotemporal features of APAP hepatotoxicity within hepatic lobules. Discrete event and agent-oriented software methods are most prominent. We instantiate and leverage a small constellation of concrete model mechanisms. Their details during execution help bring into focus ways in which particular sources of uncertainty become entangled within and across several levels with cause-effect details. Monte Carlo sampling and simulations comprise a virtual experiment. Falsification of one (or more) of the model mechanisms provides new knowledge and shrinks the model mechanism constellation incrementally. We challenge the sufficiency of four potentially explanatory theories for ALT release. The first model mechanism tested failed to achieve the initial validation target, but each of the three others succeeded. We scale ALT amounts in virtual mice directly to target plasma ALT measures in individual mice. Results for one of the three model mechanisms matched all target ALT measures quantitatively. We assert that the actual mechanisms responsible for ALT measures in individual mice and the virtual causal processes occurring during model execution are strongly analogous within and among real hepatic lobular levels.\n\nAuthor summaryInterpretations of elevated biomarkers for drug-induced liver injury assume passive release during hepatocyte death, yet indirect evidence indicates that plasma levels can increase absent injury. Limitations on measurements make it infeasible to resolve causal linkages between drug disposition and plasma levels of biomarkers. To improve explanatory knowledge, we instantiate within virtual mice, plausible mechanism-based causal linkages between acetaminophen disposition and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) behavior that enables simulation results to meet stringent quantitative validation prerequisites. We challenge the sufficiency of four model mechanisms by scaling ALT measurements in virtual mice to corresponding plasma values. Virtual experiment results in which ALT release is a combined consequence of lobular-location-dependent hepatocyte death and drug-induced cellular damage, matches all validation targets. We assert that the actual mechanisms responsible for plasma ALT measures in individual mice and the virtual causal processes occurring during model execution are strongly analogous within and among real hepatic lobular levels.",

    "abstract": "Predicting three-dimensional protein structure and assembling protein complexes using sequence information belongs to the most prominent tasks in computational biology. Recently substantial progress has been obtained in the case of single proteins using a combination of unsupervised coevolutionary sequence analysis with structurally supervised deep learning. While reaching impressive accuracies in predicting residue-residue contacts, deep learning has a number of disadvantages. The need for large structural training sets limits the applicability to multi-protein complexes; and their deep architecture makes the interpretability of the convolutional neural networks intrinsically hard. Here we introduce FilterDCA, a simpler supervised predictor for inter-domain and inter-protein contacts. It is based on the fact that contact maps of proteins show typical contact patterns, which results from secondary structure and are reflected by patterns in coevolutionary analysis. We explicitly integrate averaged contacts patterns with coevolutionary scores derived by Direct Coupling Analysis, reaching results comparable to more complex deep-learning approaches, while remaining fully transparent and interpretable. The FilterDCA code is available at http://gitlab.lcqb.upmc.fr/muscat/FilterDCA.\n\nAuthor summaryThe de novo prediction of tertiary and quaternary protein structures has recently seen important advances, by combining unsupervised, purely sequence-based coevolutionary analyses with structure-based supervision using deep learning for contact-map prediction. While showing impressive performance, deep-learning methods require large training sets and pose severe obstacles for their interpretability. Here we construct a simple, transparent and therefore fully interpretable inter-domain contact predictor, which uses the results of coevolutionary Direct Coupling Analysis in combination with explicitly constructed filters reflecting typical contact patterns in a training set of known protein structures, and which improves the accuracy of predicted contacts significantly. Our approach thereby sheds light on the question how contact information is encoded in coevolutionary signals.",

    "abstract": "The precise control of eye size is essential for normal vision. TMEM98 is a highly conserved and widely expressed gene which appears to be involved in eye size regulation. Mutations in human TMEM98 are found in patients with nanophthalmos (very small eyes) and variants near the gene are associated in population studies with myopia and increased eye size. As complete loss of function mutations in mouse Tmem98 result in perinatal lethality, we produced mice deficient for Tmem98 in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), where Tmem98 is highly expressed. These mice have greatly enlarged eyes that are very fragile with very thin retinas. To gain insight into the mechanism of action we used a proximity labelling approach to discover interacting proteins and identified MYRF as an interacting partner. Mutations of MYRF are also associated with nanophthalmos. The protein is an endoplasmic reticulum-tethered transcription factor which undergoes autoproteolytic cleavage to liberate the N-terminal part which then translocates to the nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor. We find that TMEM98 inhibits the self-cleavage of MYRF, in a novel regulatory mechanism. In RPE lacking TMEM98, MYRF is ectopically activated and abnormally localised to the nuclei.\n\nAuthor summaryHaving the correct eye size is important, too large and you will be short-sighted and too small and you will be far-sighted. Nanophthalmos, literally very small eye from the Greek, is a condition where the eye is very small but structurally normal. In addition to being farsighted such eyes are prone to glaucoma which can lead to loss of vision. Here we studied a protein called TMEM98 which is found in the membranes of the cells which form a layer at the back of eye called the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Mutations in TMEM98 have been found in nanophthalmos patients. Patients have one normal copy of the gene and one carrying a mutation. We removed Tmem98 from the RPE of mice in order to ascertain its function. We found, surprisingly, that rather than having small eyes this led to the development of very large eyes that were structurally fragile. We went to on to identify protein partners of TMEM98 and found that it interacts with a protein called MYRF, mutations in which also causes nanophthalmos. This work demonstrates the importance of TMEM98 in eye size specification.",
