    "abstract": "Paracellular barriers play an important role in the pathogenesis of IBDs and maintain gut homeostasis. N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) has been reported to be a tumor suppressor gene and inhibits colorectal cancer metastasis. However, whether NDRG2 affects colitis initiation and colitis-associated colorectal cancer is unclear. Here, We found that intestine-specific Ndrg2 deficiency caused mild spontaneous colitis with ageing, aggravated DSS and TNBS induced colitis, increased AOM-DSS induced colitis-associated tumor. Ndrg2 loss led to adherens junction (AJ) structure destruction via E-cadherin expression attenuation, resulting in diminished epithelial barrier function and increased intestinal epithelial permeability. Mechanistically, NDRG2 enhancing the interaction of E3 ligase FBXO11 with Snail, the repressor of E-cadherin, to promote Snail degradation by ubiquitination, and maintained E-cadherin expression. In human ulcerative colitis patients, reduced NDRG2 expression is positively correlated with severe inflammation. These findings demonstrate that NDRG2 is an essential colonic epithelial barrier regulator and plays important role in gut homeostasis maintenance and colitis-associated tumor development.\n\nSUMMARYAdherens junctoin (AJ) as the key part of intestinal epithelial barrier plays important role in the pathogenesis of IBDs. Intestinal specific Ndrg2 loss attenuates E-cadherin expression and disrupts the integrity of AJ structure which is feasible for colitis and tumor development.",

    "abstract": "Histone methyltransferase polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) plays a critical role in cell fate determination, and its catalytic subunit EZH2 is a key oncogenic driver in GCB-DLBCL. EZH2 inhibition in some GCB-DLBCL cell models leads to a global loss of H3K27me3, the derepression of a subset of silenced PRC2 target genes, and ultimately cell death. Here we show that EZH2 inhibition causes global redistribution of PRC2 components. We observe a reduction in the already-low levels of PRC2 at active genes. On the other hand, focal PRC2 accumulation and concomitant H3K27me3 retention occur at many canonical embryonic stem cell PRC2 nucleation sites. PRC2 accumulation is also enriched in plasma/memory cell genes repressed by PRC2 activity in the germinal center. We see PRC2 redistribution to, and H3K27me3 retention at, differentiation-related genes not only in cell lines that are insensitive to killing by EZH2 inhibition, but also in sensitive cell lines. Thus, PRC2 redistribution to B cell differentiation genes is not sufficient to explain the resistance to EZH2 inhibitors in some DLBCL cell lines.",

But vergence has never been tested as an absolute distance cue divorced from obvious confounding cues such as binocular disparity. In this article we control for these confounding cues for the first time by gradually manipulating vergence, and find that observers fail to accurately judge distance from vergence. We consider a number of different interpretations of these results, and argue that the most principled response to these results is to question the general effectiveness of vergence as an absolute distance cue. Given other absolute distance cues (such as motion parallax and vertical disparities) are limited in application, this poses a real challenge to our contemporary understanding of visual scale.",

    "abstract": "Infection with a single influenza A virus (IAV) is only rarely sufficient to initiate productive infection. Here, we exploit both single-cell approaches and whole-animal systems to show that IAV reliance on multiple infection can form an important species barrier to infection. Namely, we find that H9N2 subtype viruses representative of those circulating widely at the poultry-human interface exhibit acute dependence on collective interactions in mammalian systems. This need for multiple infection is greatly reduced in the natural host. Quantification of incomplete viral genomes showed that their complementation accounts for the more moderate reliance on coinfection seen in avian cells, but not the added reliance seen in mammalian cells. This finding suggests an additional form of virus-virus interaction is needed to support infection in mammalian cells. Genetic mapping implicated the PA gene segment as a major driver of this phenotype and quantification of viral RNA synthesis indicated that both replication and transcription were affected. These findings indicate that multiple distinct mechanisms underlie IAV reliance on multiple infection and underscore the importance of virus-virus interactions in IAV infection, evolution and emergence.",

    "abstract": "Auditory phase-locked responses are affected by aging and it has been proposed that this increases the challenges experienced during speech perception in noise (SPiN). However, this proposal lacks direct support. This issue was addressed by measuring speech-evoked phase-locked responses at subcortical (frequency-following responses, FFRs) and cortical (theta-band phase-locking, {theta}-PLV) levels, and studying the relationship between these phase-locked responses and SPiN (word report accuracies of sentences listened to in noise) in adults across a wide age-range (19-75 years old). It was found that: (1) FFR magnitudes declined with age after hearing loss was controlled for; (2) {theta}-PLV increased with age, suggesting cortical hyperexcitability in audition; (3) SPiN correlated positively with FFR magnitudes obtained in quiet and with {theta}-PLV obtained in noise, suggesting that impacts of aging (smaller FFR magnitudes and greater {theta}-PLV) on SPiN differ at subcortical and cortical levels. Thus, the current study provided evidence for different mechanisms at subcortical and cortical levels through which age affects speech-evoked phase-locked activities and SPiN.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMulticellular organisms are characterized by a wide diversity of forms and complexity despite a restricted set of key molecules and mechanisms at the base of organismal development. Development combines three basic processes -- asymmetric cell division, signaling and gene regulation -- in a multitude of ways to create this overwhelming diversity of multicellular life-forms. Here, we use a generative model to test the limits to which such processes can be combined to generate multiple differentiation paths during development, and attempt to chart the diversity of multicellular organisms generated.\n\nResultsWe sample millions of biologically feasible developmental schemes, allowing us to comment on the statistical properties of cell-differentiation trajectories they produce. We characterize model-generated  organisms using the graph topology of their cell-type lineage maps. Remarkably, tree-type lineage differentiation maps are the rarest in our data. Additionally, a majority of the  organisms generated by our model appear to be endowed with the ability to regenerate using pluripotent cells.\n\nConclusionsOur results indicate that, in contrast to common views, cell-type lineage graphs are unlikely to be tree-like. Instead, they are more likely to be directed acyclic graphs, with multiple lineages converging on the same terminal cell-type. Furthermore, the high incidence of pluripotent cells in model-generated organisms stands in line with the long-standing hypothesis that whole body regeneration is an epiphenomenon of development. We discuss experimentally testable predictions of our model, and some ways to adapt the generative framework to test additional hypotheses about general features of development.",

    "abstract": "Given current clinical interest in vagus nerve stimulation, there are surprisingly few studies characterizing the anatomy of the vagus nerve in large animal models as it pertains to on-and off-target engagement of local fibers. We sought to address this gap by evaluating vagal anatomy in the domestic pig, whose vagus nerve organization and size approximates the human cervical vagus nerve. We provide data on key features across the cervical vagus nerve including diameter, number and diameter of fascicles, and distance of fascicles from the epineural surface where stimulating electrodes are placed. We also characterized the relative locations of the superior and recurrent laryngeal branches of the vagus nerve that have been implicated in therapy limiting side effects with common electrode placement. We identified key variants across the cohort that may be important for vagus nerve stimulation with respect to changing sympathetic/parasympathetic tone, such as cross-connections to the sympathetic trunk. We discovered that cell bodies of pseudo-unipolar cells aggregate together to form a very distinct grouping within the nodose ganglion. This distinct grouping gives rise to a larger number of smaller fascicles as one moves caudally down the cervical vagus nerve. This often leads to a distinct bimodal organization, or  vagotopy that may be advantageous to exploit in design of electrodes/stimulation paradigms. Finally, we placed our data in context of historic and recent histology spanning mouse, rat, canine, pig, non-human primate and human models, thus providing a comprehensive resource to understand similarities and differences across species.",

    "abstract": "Predicting drug sensitivity profiles from genotypes is a major challenge in personalized medicine. Machine learning and deep neural network methods have shown promise in addressing this challenge, but the \"black-box\" nature of these methods precludes a mechanistic understanding of how and which genomic and proteomic features contribute to the observed drug sensitivity profiles. Here we provide a combination of statistical and neural network framework that not only estimates drug IC50 in cancer cell lines with high accuracy (R2 = 0.861 and RMSE = 0.818) but also identifies features contributing to the accuracy, thereby enhancing explainability. Our framework, termed QSMART, uses a multi-component approach that includes (1) collecting drug fingerprints, cancer cell lines multi-omics features, and drug responses, (2) testing the statistical significance of interaction terms, (3) selecting features by Lasso with Bayesian information criterion, and (4) using neural networks to predict drug response. We evaluate the contribution of each of these components and use a case study to explain the biological relevance of several selected features to protein kinase inhibitor response in non-small cell lung cancer cells. Specifically, we illustrate how interaction terms that capture associations between drugs and mutant kinases quantitatively contribute to the response of two EGFR inhibitors (afatinib and lapatinib) in non-small cell lung cancer cells. Although we have tested QSMART on protein kinase inhibitors, it can be extended across the proteome to investigate the complex relationships connecting genotypes and drug sensitivity profiles.",

Here, we combine cryo-electron tomography, proteomics and cell biology studies to investigate the effects of protein aggregates in primary neurons. We use artificial amyloid-like {beta}-sheet proteins ({beta} proteins) to focus on the gain-of-function aspect of aggregation. These proteins form fibrillar aggregates and cause neurotoxicity. We show that late stages of autophagy are impaired by the aggregates, resulting in lysosomal alterations reminiscent of lysosomal storage disorders. Mechanistically, {beta} proteins interact with and sequester AP-31, a subunit of the AP-3 adaptor complex involved in protein trafficking to lysosomal organelles. This leads to destabilization of the AP-3 complex, missorting of AP-3 cargo, and lysosomal defects. Restoring AP-31 expression ameliorates neurotoxicity caused by {beta} proteins. Altogether, our results highlight the link between protein aggregation and neurotoxicity, pointing to lysosomes as particularly vulnerable organelles.",

    "abstract": "Primary cilia (PC) are important signaling hubs in cells and their deregulation has been associated with various diseases including cancer. Here we explored the role of PC in colorectal cancer (CRC) and colitis. In the colon we found PC to be mostly present on different subtypes of fibroblasts. Colons of mice exposed to either chemically induced colitis-associated colon carcinogenesis (CAC) or dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis had decreased numbers of PC. We employed conditional knock-out strains for the PC essential genes, Kif3A and Ift88, to generate mice with reduced numbers of PC on colonic fibroblasts. These mice showed an increased susceptibility in the CAC model as well as in DSS-induced colitis. Colons from DSS-treated mice with PC-deficiency on fibroblasts displayed an elevated production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and colonic epithelial cells had diminished levels of HES-1, a key transcription factor of Notch signaling. Notably, an analysis of PC presence on biopsies of patients with ulcerative colitis as well as CRC patients revealed decreased numbers of PC on colonic fibroblasts in pathological versus surrounding normal tissue. Taken together, we provide evidence that a decrease in colonic PC numbers promotes colitis and CRC.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=177 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/871772v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f8eccdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1829b3borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19d632aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d9833b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "A key goal of protein engineering is to accurately model the stability and catalytic activity of enzymes. However, the limitations of functional predictive abilities pose a major challenge for modeling algorithm design, and can be attributed to the lack of large data sets quantifying the functional properties of enzymes. Here, the thermal stability (TM) and Michaelis-Menten constants (kcat, KM, and kcat/KM) of six new variants of the {beta}-glucosidase B (BglB) protein are quantitatively characterized. Molecular stability of the enzyme variants were hypothesized using the Foldit software and BglB was synthesized in E. coli cells. Testing was done through a colorimetric kinetic assay and thermal stability fluorescence-based protein unfolding assay. Results from the assays suggest that all mutations, with the exception of variant Y169M, all experienced reduced catalytic efficiency compared to the wildtype. Assay results indicate that variant W123R is more thermally stable compared to the wildtype, while the differences in thermal stability between the other variants, and the wildtype are negligible. The collected thermal stability and catalytic efficiency data has been added to a data set with the aim of improving Rosetta algorithms for modeling and predicting the functional interactions between biomolecules through a machine learning algorithm and facilitate the precise engineering of protein catalysts.",

In an evolutionary twist, toxins betray the identity of their bearers when herbivores co-opt them as cues for host-plant finding, but the mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. We focused on Scaptomyza flava, an herbivorous drosophilid specialized on isothiocyanate (ITC)-producing (Brassicaceae) plants, and identified Or67b paralogs that were triplicated as mustard-specific herbivory evolved. Using heterologous systems for the expression of olfactory receptors, we found that S. flava Or67bs, but not homologs from microbe-feeding relatives, responded selectively to ITCs, each paralog detecting different ITC subsets. Consistent with this, S. flava was attracted to ITCs, as was Drosophila melanogaster expressing S. flava Or67b3 in the homologous Or67b olfactory circuit. Thus, our results show that plant toxins were likely co-opted as olfactory attractants through gene duplication and functional specialization (neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization) in drosophilid flies.",

An anion conductance was found essential for maturation and acidification of secretory granules four decades ago, but its genetic identity was unknown. We now demonstrate that chromogranin B (CHGB), an obligate granule protein, constitutes the long-sought anion channel. High-pressure freezing immuno-electron microscopy and biochemical assays showed native CHGB in close proximity to secretory granule membranes, and its membrane-bound and soluble forms both reconstituted Cl- channels. Release of secretory granules delivered CHGB clusters to plasma membranes, which dominate whole-cell anion conductance. Intragranular pH measurements and cargo maturation assays found that CHGB channels supported proinsulin - insulin conversion and dopamine-loading in neuroendocrine cells. {beta}-cells from Chgb-/- mice exhibited significant granule deacidification, accounting for hyperproinsulinemia, altered glucose-tolerance response and lower dopamine concentration in chromaffin granules in these animals.

    "abstract": "In spite of a large investment in the development of methodologies for analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data, there is still little agreement on how to best normalize such data, i.e. how to quantify gene expression states of single cells from such data. Starting from a few basic requirements such as that inferred expression states should correct for both intrinsic biological fluctuations and measurement noise, and that changes in expression state should be measured in terms of fold-changes rather than changes in absolute levels, we here derive a unique Bayesian procedure for normalizing single-cell RNA-seq data from first principles. Our implementation of this normalization procedure, called Sanity (SAmpling Noise corrected Inference of Transcription activitY), estimates log expression values and associated errors bars directly from raw UMI counts without any tunable parameters.\n\nComparison of Sanity with other recent normalization methods on a selection of scRNA-seq datasets shows that Sanity outperforms other methods on basic downstream processing tasks such as clustering cells into subtypes and identification of differentially expressed genes. More importantly, we show that all other normalization methods present severely distorted pictures of the data. By failing to account for biological and technical Poisson noise, many methods systematically predict the lowest expressed genes to be most variable in expression, whereas in reality these genes provide least evidence of true biological variability. In addition, by confounding noise removal with lower-dimensional representation of the data, many methods introduce strong spurious correlations of expression levels with the total UMI count of each cell as well as spurious co-expression of genes.",

    "abstract": "The flavours of foods and beverages are formed by the agricultural environment where the plants are grown. In the case of wine, the location and environmental features of the vineyard site imprint the wine with distinctive aromas and flavours. Microbial growth and metabolism play an integral role in wine production from the vineyard to the winery, by influencing grapevine health, wine fermentation, and the flavour, aroma and quality of finished wines. The mechanism by which microbial distribution patterns drive wine metabolites is unclear and while flavour has been correlated with bacterial composition for red wines, bacterial activity provides a minor biochemical conversion in wine fermentation. Here, we collected samples across six distinct winegrowing areas in southern Australia to investigate regional distribution patterns of both fungi and bacteria and how this corresponds with wine aroma compounds. Results show that soil and must microbiota distinguish winegrowing regions and are related to wine chemical profiles. We found a strong relationship between microbial and wine metabolic profiles, and this relationship was maintained despite differing abiotic drivers (soil properties and weather/ climatic measures). Notably, fungal communities played the principal role in shaping wine aroma profiles and regional distinctiveness. We found that the soil microbiome is a potential source of grape- and must-associated fungi, and therefore the weather and soil conditions could influence the wine characteristics via shaping the soil fungal community compositions. Our study describes a comprehensive scenario of wine microbial biogeography in which microbial diversity responds to surrounding environments and ultimately sculpts wine aromatic characteristics. These findings provide perspectives for thoughtful human practices to optimise food and beverage flavour and composition through understanding of fungal activity and abundance.",
