    "abstract": "The Drosophila Y-chromosome is gene poor and mainly consists of silenced, repetitive DNA. Nonetheless, the Y influences expression of hundreds of genes genome-wide, possibly by sequestering key components of the heterochromatin machinery away from other positions in the genome. To test the influence of the Y chromosome on the genome-wide chromatin landscape, we assayed the genomic distribution of histone modifications associated with gene activation (H3K4me3), or heterochromatin (H3K9me2 and H3K9me3) in fruit flies with varying sex chromosome complements (X0, XY and XYY males; XX and XXY females). Consistent with the general deficiency of active chromatin modifications on the Y, we find that Y gene dose has little influence on the genomic distribution of H3K4me3. In contrast, both the presence and the number of Y-chromosomes strongly influence genome-wide enrichment patterns of repressive chromatin modifications. Highly repetitive regions such as the pericentromeres, the dot, and the Y chromosome (if present) are enriched for heterochromatic modifications in wildtype males and females, and even more strongly in X0 flies. In contrast, the additional Y chromosome in XYY males and XXY females diminishes the heterochromatic signal in these normally silenced, repeat-rich regions, which is accompanied by an increase in expression of Y-linked repeats. We find hundreds of genes that are expressed differentially between individuals with aberrant sex chromosome karyotypes, many of which also show sex-biased expression in wildtype Drosophila. Thus, Y-chromosomes influence heterochromatin integrity genome-wide, and differences in the chromatin landscape of males and females may also contribute to sex-biased gene expression and sexual dimorphisms.",

    "abstract": "Neurogenesis in the developing neocortex begins with the generation of the preplate, which consists of early born neurons including Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells and subplate neurons. Here, utilizing the Ebf2-EGFP transgenic mouse in which EGFP initially labels the preplate neurons then persists in CR cells, we reveal the dynamic transcriptome profiles of early neurogenesis and CR cell differentiation. At E15.5 when Ebf2-EGFP+ cells are mostly CR neurons, single-cell sequencing analysis of purified Ebf2-EGFP+ cells uncovers molecular heterogeneity in CR neurons, but without apparent clustering of cells with distinct regional origins. Along a pseudotemporal trajectory these cells are classified into three different developing states, revealing genetic cascades from early generic neuronal differentiation to late fate specification during the establishment of CR neuron identity and function. Further genome-wide RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analyses at multiple early neurogenic stages have revealed the temporal gene expression dynamics of early neurogenesis and distinct histone modification patterns in early differentiating neurons. We have also identified a new set of coding genes and lncRNAs involved in early neuronal differentiation and validated with functional assays In Vitro and In Vivo. Our findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms governing the early differentiation steps during cortical development, especially CR neuron biology, and help understand the developmental basis for cortical function and diseases.",

    "abstract": "The forward time simulation tool rSHAPE (R-package for Simulated Haploid Asexual Population Evolution) was designed to complement the theoretical and empirical study of evolution. Included with rSHAPE are functions to programmatically build, run, and initially process results of an evolutionary experiment defined by the range of experimental conditions. As experimental evolution often studies both the emergence and fate of de novo mutants, I validated rSHAPE by confirming its ability to replicate seminal theoretical expectations concerning changes in fitness through time and the fixation probability of mutants. As an example of how rSHAPE can support both theoretical and empirical research, I applied rSHAPE to study how the laboratory protocol of serial passaging, common in microbial experimental evolution, affects the fixation probability of de novo mutants. Unlike related theoretical work which modelled growth as effectively exponential (Wahl et al., 2002), this study considered populations experiencing logistic growth which is common to microbes undergoing serial passaging. In contrast to exponential growth, when a population undergoes logistic growth the probability of a mutant arising and eventually fixing depends upon when a mutant arises during a growth phase.

An assembled T2SS has not yet been isolated in vitro. Here we use a fusion of negative stain and cryo-electron microscopy (EM) to reveal the core architecture of an assembled T2SS from the pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae. We show that 7 proteins form a [~]2.5 MDa complex that spans the cell envelope. The outer membrane complex (OMC) includes the secretin PulD with all domains modelled and the pilotin PulS. The inner membrane assembly platform (AP) components PulC, PulE, PulL, PulM and PulN have a relative stoichiometric ratio of 2:1:1:1:1, respectively. The PulE ATPase, PulL and PulM combine to form a flexible hexameric hub. Symmetry mismatch between the OMC and AP is overcome by PulC linkers spanning the periplasm with PulC HR domains binding independently at the secretin base. Our results show the T2SS to have a highly dynamic modular architecture with implication for pseudo-pilus assembly and substrate loading.",

    "abstract": "Spatially-indexed repeated detection-nondetection data is widely collected by ecologists interested in estimating parameters associated with species distribution, relative abundance, phenology, and more while accounting for imperfect detection. Recent model development has focused on accounting for false positive error as well, given growing recognition that misclassification is common across many sampling protocols. To date, however, the development of model-based solutions to false positive error has been largely restricted to occupancy models. We describe a general form of the observation confirmation protocol originally described for occupancy estimation that permits investigators to flexibly and intuitively extend several models for detection-nondetection data to account for false positive error. Simulation results demonstrate that estimators for relative abundance and arrival time exhibit relative bias greater than 20% under realistic levels of false positive prevalence (e.g., 5% of detections are false positive). Bias increases as true and false positives occur in more distinct places or times, but can also be sensitive to the values of the state variables of interest, sampling design, and sampling efficiency. Results from an empirical study focusing on patterns of gray fox relative abundance across Wisconsin, USA suggest that false positive error can also distort estimated spatial patterns often used to guide decision-making. The extended estimators described within typically improve performance at any level of confirmation, and when false positive error occurs at random and constitutes less than 10% of all detections, the estimators are essentially unbiased when more than 50 observations can be confirmed as true or false positives. The generalized form of the observation-confirmation protocol is a flexible model-based solution to false positive error useful for researchers collecting data with sampling devices like trail or smartphone cameras, acoustic recorders, or other techniques where classifications can be reviewed post-hoc.",

    "abstract": "Neurexins are neuronal adhesion molecules important for synapse maturation, function, and plasticity. Neurexins have been genetically associated with neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and schizophrenia, but can have variable penetrance and phenotypic severity. Heritability studies indicate that a significant percentage of risk for ASD and schizophrenia includes environmental factors, highlighting the poorly understood interplay between genetic and environmental factors in pathogenesis of these disorders. The singular C. elegans ortholog of human neurexins, nrx-1, controls experience-dependent morphologic remodeling of a GABAergic neuron in adult males. Here I show that this GABAergic neurons morphology is altered in response to each of three environmental stressors (nutritional, heat, or genotoxic stress) applied during sexual maturation, but not during adulthood. Increased outgrowth of axon-like neurites following adolescent stress results from an altered morphologic plasticity that occurs upon entry into adulthood. Despite axonal remodeling being induced by each of the three stressors, only nutritional stress (starvation) impacts behavior and is dependent on neurexin/nrx-1. Heat or genotoxic stress during sexual maturation did not alter behavior despite inducing GABAergic neuron remodeling, and this remodeling was independent of neurexin/nrx-1. Remodeling induced by starvation stress was found be dependent on neuroligin/nlg-1, the canonical binding partner for neurexin/nrx-1, as well as the stress signaling transcription factors FOXO/daf-16 and HSF1/hsf-1, each of which was also found to have unique roles in remodeling induced by heat and UV stress. The differential molecular mechanisms underlying GABAergic neuron remodeling in response to different stressors, and the disparate effects of stressors on behavior, is a novel paradigm for understanding how genetics, environmental exposures, and plasticity may contribute to brain dysfunction in ASDs and schizophrenia.",

We show that CTT aSyn localizes in mitochondria in PD patients and controls, whereas the organization of Ser129-p in a cytoplasmic network is strongly associated with pathology. Nigral Lewy bodies show an onion skin-like architecture, with a structured framework of Ser129-p aSyn and neurofilaments encapsulating CTT aSyn in their core, which displayed high content of proteins and lipids by label-free CARS microscopy.

    "abstract": "There is significant interest in the development and application of deep neural networks (DNNs) to neuroimaging data. A growing literature suggests that DNNs outperform their classical counterparts in a variety of neuroimaging applications, yet there are few direct comparisons of relative utility. Here, we compared the performance of three DNN architectures and a classical machine learning algorithm (kernel regression) in predicting individual phenotypes from whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) patterns. One of the DNNs was a generic fully-connected feedforward neural network, while the other two DNNs were recently published approaches specifically designed to exploit the structure of connectome data. By using a combined sample of almost 10,000 participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and UK Biobank, we showed that the three DNNs and kernel regression achieved similar performance across a wide range of behavioral and demographic measures. Furthermore, the generic feedforward neural network exhibited similar performance to the two state-of-the-art connectome-specific DNNs. When predicting fluid intelligence in the UK Biobank, performance of all algorithms dramatically improved when sample size increased from 100 to 1000 subjects. Improvement was smaller, but still significant, when sample size increased from 1000 to 5000 subjects. Importantly, kernel regression was competitive across all sample sizes. Overall, our study suggests that kernel regression is as effective as DNNs for RSFC-based behavioral prediction, while incurring significantly lower computational costs. Therefore, kernel regression might serve as a useful baseline algorithm for future studies.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWPlacing a new species on an existing phylogeny has increasing relevance to several applications. Placement can be used to update phylogenies in a scalable fashion and can help identify unknown query samples using (meta-)barcoding, skimming, or metagenomic data. Maximum likelihood (ML) methods of phylogenetic placement exist, but these methods are not scalable to reference trees with many thousands of leaves, limiting their ability to enjoy benefits of dense taxon sampling in modern reference libraries. They also rely on assembled sequences for the reference set and aligned sequences for the query. Thus, ML methods cannot analyze datasets where the reference consists of unassembled reads, a scenario relevant to emerging applications of genome-skimming for sample identification. We introduce APPLES, a distance-based method for phylogenetic placement. Compared to ML, APPLES is an order of magnitude faster and more memory efficient, and unlike ML, it is able to place on large backbone trees (tested for up to 200,000 leaves). We show that using dense references improves accuracy substantially so that APPLES on dense trees is more accurate than ML on sparser trees, where it can run. Finally, APPLES can accurately identify samples without assembled reference or aligned queries using kmer-based distances, a scenario that ML cannot handle.

Targeting either dCas9-VP16(10x) or dCas9-p300(core) to ERBS induces H3K27ac and activates nearby expression in a manner similar to an estrogen induction, with dCas9-VP16(10x) acting as a stronger activator. The sufficiency of individual ERBS is highly correlated with their necessity, indicating an inherent activation potential that is associated with the binding of RNA polymerase II and several transcription factors. By targeting ERBS combinations, we found that ERBS work independently to control gene expression when bound by synthetic activators. The sufficiency results contrast necessity assays that show synergy between these ERBS, suggesting that synergy occurs between ERBS in terms of activator recruitment, whereas directly recruiting activators leads to independent effects on gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Proteins need to interconvert between many conformations in order to function, many of which are formed transiently, and sparsely populated. Particularly when the lifetimes of these states approach the millisecond timescale, identifying the relevant structures and the mechanism by which they inter-convert remains a tremendous challenge. Here we introduce a novel combination of accelerated MD (aMD) simulations and Markov State modelling (MSM) to explore these  excited conformational states. Applying this to the highly dynamic protein CypA, a protein involved in immune response and associated with HIV infection, we identify five principally populated conformational states and the atomistic mechanism by which they interconvert. A rational design strategy predicted that the mutant D66A should stabilise the minor conformations and substantially alter the dynamics whereas the similar mutant H70A should leave the landscape broadly unchanged. These predictions are confirmed using CPMG and R1{rho} solution state NMR measurements. By accurately and reliably exploring functionally relevant, but sparsely populated conformations with milli-second lifetimes in silico, our aMD/MSM method has tremendous promise for the design of dynamic protein free energy landscapes for both protein engineering and drug discovery.",

To propagate they shed large parts of their body; to replace these lost tissues they regenerate proglottids (segments) as part of normal homeostasis. Their remarkable growth and regeneration are fueled by adult somatic stem cells that have yet to be characterized molecularly. Using the rat intestinal tapeworm, Hymenolepis diminuta, we find that regenerative potential is regionally limited to the neck, where head-dependent extrinsic signals create a permissive microenvironment for stem cell-driven regeneration. Using transcriptomic analyses and RNA interference, we characterize and functionally validate regulators of tapeworm growth and regeneration. We find no evidence that stem cells are restricted to the regeneration-competent neck. Instead, lethally irradiated tapeworms can be rescued when cells from either regeneration-competent or regeneration-incompetent regions are transplanted into the neck. Together, the head and neck tissues provide extrinsic cues that regulate stem cells, enabling region-specific regeneration in this parasite.",

We found that both species are remarkably resilient, as genetic diversity and gene flow patterns were unaffected by habitat loss.

Newer drugs with proven clinical efficacy correlating with in vitro susceptibility should be substituted with first- and second line anti-TB drug testing.",

    "abstract": "Although it is suspected that there are millions of distinct viral species, fewer than 9,000 are catalogued in GenBanks RefSeq database. We selectively enriched for and amplified the genomes of circular DNA viruses in over 70 animal samples, ranging from cultured soil nematodes to human tissue specimens. A bioinformatics pipeline, Cenote-Taker, was developed to automatically annotate over 2,500 circular genomes in a GenBank-compliant format. The new genomes belong to dozens of established and emerging viral families. Some appear to be the result of previously undescribed recombination events between ssDNA viruses and ssRNA viruses. In addition, hundreds of circular DNA elements that do not encode any discernable similarities to previously characterized sequences were identified. To characterize these \"dark matter\" sequences, we used an artificial neural network to identify candidate viral capsid proteins, several of which formed virus-like particles when expressed in culture. These data further the understanding of viral sequence diversity and allow for high throughput documentation of the virosphere.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORCl) plays an important role in dendritic translation, synaptic plasticity, and learning and memory. We previously showed that heavy alcohol use activates mTORC1 in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) of rodents. Here, we set out to determine the consequences of alcohol-dependent mTORC1 activation in the OFC. We found that although inhibition of mTORC1 in the OFC does not alter rat alcohol intake per se, it attenuates alcohol seeking. We then tested whether mTORC1 in the OFC is required for goal-directed or habitual alcohol seeking. To do so, rats were trained self-administer alcohol under a random ratio (RR) or a random interval (RI) schedule of reinforcement, which biases toward goal-directed or habitual responding, respectively, and tested whether mTORC1 inhibition alters lever presses following alcohol devaluation. We found that pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 or knockdown of the adaptor protein, Raptor, did not affect goal-directed alcohol responding but restored sensitivity to devaluation in RI-trained rats. In contrast, habitual responding for sucrose was unaltered by mTORC1 inhibition. These data suggest that mTORC1 in the OFC drives alcohol habit. We then elucidate the mechanism by which mTORC1 is activated by alcohol, and found that the recruitment of GluN2B during alcohol withdrawal stimulates mTORC1 in OFC cFos-positive neurons. Finally, we show that inhibition of GluN2B in the OFC attenuates both alcohol seeking and habitual responding for alcohol. Together, our data suggest that alcohol withdrawal promotes an NMDAR-dependent activation of mTORC1 which in turn drives habitual alcohol seeking.",

    "abstract": "In the nuclear pore complex (NPC), intrinsically disordered nuclear pore proteins (FG nups) form a selective barrier for transport into and out of the cell nucleus, in a way that remains poorly understood. The collective FG nup behaviour has long been conceptualized either as a polymer brush, dominated by entropic and excluded-volume (repulsive) interactions, or as a hydrogel, dominated by cohesive (attractive) interactions between FG nups. Here we compare mesoscale computational simulations with a wide range of experimental data to demonstrate that FG nups are at the crossover point between these two regimes. Specifically, we find that repulsive and attractive interactions are balanced, resulting in morphologies and dynamics that are close to those of ideal polymer chains. We demonstrate that this property of FG nups yields sufficient cohesion to seal the transport barrier, and yet maintains fast dynamics at the molecular scale, permitting the rapid polymer rearrangements needed for transport events.",

    "abstract": "Sequences of action potentials, or spikes, carry information in the number of spikes and their timing. Spike timing codes are critical in many sensory systems, but there is now growing evidence that millisecond-scale changes in timing also carry information in motor brain regions, descending decision-making circuits, and individual motor units. Across all the many signals that control a behavior how ubiquitous, consistent, and coordinated are spike timing codes? Assessing these open questions ideally involves recording across the whole motor program with spike-level resolution. To do this, we took advantage of the relatively few motor units controlling the wings of a hawk moth, Manduca sexta. We simultaneously recorded nearly every action potential from all major wing muscles and the resulting forces in tethered flight. We found that timing encodes more information about turning behavior than spike count in every motor unit, even though there is sufficient variation in count alone. Flight muscles vary broadly in function as well as in the number and timing of spikes. Nonetheless, each muscle with multiple spikes consistently blends spike timing and count information in a 3:1 ratio. Coding strategies are consistent. Finally, we assess the coordination of muscles using pairwise redundancy measured through interaction information. Surprisingly, not only are all muscle pairs coordinated, but all coordination is accomplished almost exclusively through spike timing, not spike count. Spike timing codes are ubiquitous, consistent, and essential for coordination.\\n\\nSignificance StatementBrains can encode precise sensory stimuli and specific motor systems also appear to be precise, but how important are millisecond changes in timing of neural spikes across the whole motor program for a behavior? We record every spike that the hawk moths nervous system sends to its wing muscles. We show that all muscles convey the majority of their information in spike timing. The number of spikes does play a role, but not in a coordinated way across muscles. Instead, all coordination is done using in the millisecond timing of in spikes. The importance and prevalence of timing across the motor program pose new questions for how nervous systems create precise, coordinated motor commands.",

    "abstract": "Purple nonsulfur bacteria (PNSB) use light for energy and organic substrates for carbon and electrons when growing photoheterotrophically. This lifestyle generates more reduced electron carriers than are required for biosynthesis, even during consumption of some of the most oxidized organic substrates like malate and fumarate. Excess reduced electron carriers must be oxidized for photoheterotrophic growth to occur. Diverse PNSB commonly rely on the CO2-fixing Calvin cycle to oxidize excess reduced electron carriers. Some PNSB also produce H2 or reduce terminal electron acceptors as alternatives to the Calvin cycle. Rhodospirillum rubrum Calvin cycle mutants defy this trend by growing phototrophically on malate or fumarate without H2 production or access to terminal electron acceptors. We used 13C-tracer experiments to examine how a Rs. rubrum Calvin cycle mutant maintains electron balance under such conditions. We detected the reversal of some TCA cycle enzymes, which carried reductive flux from malate or fumarate to -ketoglutarate. This pathway and the reductive synthesis of amino acids derived from -ketoglutarate are likely important for electron balance, as supplementing the growth medium with -ketoglutarate-derived amino acids prevented Rs. rubrum Calvin cycle mutant growth unless a terminal electron acceptor was provided. Flux estimates also suggested that the Calvin cycle mutant preferentially synthesized isoleucine using the reductive threonine-dependent pathway instead of the less-reductive citramalate-dependent pathway. Collectively, our results suggest that alternative biosynthetic pathways can contribute to electron balance within the constraints of a relatively constant biomass composition.",

    "abstract": "Juvenile hormone (JH) is a key regulator of insect development and reproduction. Given that JH commonly affects adult insect fertility, it has been hypothesized to also regulate behaviors such as dominance and aggression that are associated with reproduction. We tested this hypothesis in the bumble bee Bombus terrestris for which JH has been shown to be the major gonadotropin. We used the allatoxin Precocene-I (P-I) to reduce hemolymph JH titers and replacement therapy with the natural JH to revert this effect. In small orphan groups of workers with similar body size but mixed treatment, P-I treated bees showed lower aggressiveness, oogenesis, and dominance rank compared with control and replacement therapy treated bees. In similar groups in which all bees were treated similarly, there was a clear dominance hierarchy, even in P-I and replacement therapy treatment groups in which the bees showed similar levels of ovarian activation. In a similar experiment in which bees differed in body size, larger bees were more likely to be dominant despite their similar JH treatment and ovarian state. In the last experiment, we show that JH manipulation does not affect dominance rank in groups that had already established a stable dominance hierarchy. These findings solve previous ambiguities concerning whether or not JH affects dominance in bumble bees. JH positively affects dominance, but bees with similar levels of JH can nevertheless establish dominance hierarchies. Thus, multiple factors including JH, body size, and previous experience affect dominance and aggression in social bumble bees.",

    "abstract": "Although the lung is an obvious target for site-specific delivery of many therapeutics for respiratory airway diseases such as asthma, COPD, and cystic fibrosis, novel strategies are needed to avoid key physiologic barriers for efficient delivery and controlled release of therapeutics to the lungs. Specifically, deposition into the deep lung requires particles with a 1-5 {micro}m aerodynamic diameter; however, particles with a geometric diameter less than 6 {micro}m are rapidly cleared by alveolar macrophages. Additionally, epithelial, endothelial, and fibroblast cells prefer smaller (< 300 nm) nanoparticles for efficient endocytosis. Here we address these contradictory design requirements by using a nanoparticle-inside-microgel system (Nano-in-Microgel). Using an improved maleimide-thiol based Michael Addition during (water-in-oil) Emulsion (MADE) method, we fabricated both trypsin-responsive and neutrophil elastase-responsive polymeric Nano-in-Microgel to show the versatility of the system in easily exchanging enzyme-responsive crosslinkers for disease-specific proteases. By varying the initial macromer concentration, from 20-50 % w/v, the size distribution means ranged from 4-8 {micro}m, enzymatic degradation of the microgels is within 30 minutes, and in vitro macrophage phagocytosis is lower for the higher % w/v. We further demonstrated that in vivo lung delivery of the multi-stage carriers through the pulmonary route yields particle retention up to several hours and followed by clearance within in naive mice. Our results provide a further understanding of how enzymatically-degradable multi-stage polymeric carriers can be used for pulmonary drug delivery.\\n\\nGraphical Abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=60 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/650911v2_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (15K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dcd1dcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@55e23eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@788c02org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@30161f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "High Content Screening is an important tool in drug discovery and characterisation. Often, high content drug screens are performed on one single cell line. Yet, a single cell line cannot be thought of as a perfect disease model. Many diseases feature an important molecular heterogeneity. Consequently, a drug may be effective against one molecular subtype of a disease, but less so against another. To characterise drugs with respect to their effect not only on one cell line but on a panel of cell lines is therefore a promising strategy to streamline the drug discovery process. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we investigate whether we can predict drug mechanism of action (MOA) at the molecular level without optimisation of the MOA classes to the screen specificities. To this end, we benchmark a set of algorithms within a conventional pipeline, and evaluate their MOA prediction performance according to a statistically rigorous framework. Second, we extend this conventional pipeline to the simultaneous analysis of multiple cell lines, each manifesting potentially different morphological baselines. For this, we propose multitask autoencoders, including a domain-adaptive model used to construct domain-invariant feature representations across cell lines. We apply these methods to a pilot screen of two triple negative breast cancer cell lines as models for two different molecular subtypes of the disease.",

    "abstract": "The Ribosome-associated Quality Control (RQC) pathway co-translationally marks incomplete polypeptides from stalled translation with two signals that trigger their proteasome-mediated degradation. The E3 ligase Ltn1 adds ubiquitin and Rqc2 directs the large ribosomal subunit to append carboxy-terminal alanine and threonine residues (CAT tails). When excessive amounts of incomplete polypeptides evade Ltn1, CAT-tailed proteins accumulate and can self-associate into aggregates. CAT tail aggregation has been hypothesized to either protect cells by sequestering potentially toxic incomplete polypeptides or harm cells by disrupting protein homeostasis. To distinguish between these possibilities, we modulated CAT tail aggregation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae with genetic and chemical tools to analyze CAT tails in aggregated and un-aggregated states. We found that enhancing CAT tail aggregation induces proteotoxic stress and antagonizes degradation of CAT-tailed proteins, while inhibiting aggregation reverses these effects. Our findings suggest that CAT tail aggregation harms RQC-compromised cells and that preventing aggregation can mitigate this toxicity.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of high throughput technologies that produce vast amounts of genomic data, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) are transforming biological research. The dramatic increase in the volume of data makes analysis the main bottleneck for scientific discovery. The processing of high throughput datasets typically involves many different computational programs, each of which performs a specific step in a pipeline. Given the wide range of applications and organizational infrastructures, there is a great need for a highly-parallel, flexible, portable, and reproducible data processing frameworks. Flexibility ensures that pipelines can support a variety of applications without requiring one-off modifications. Portability ensures that users can leverage computationally available resources and work within economic constraints. Reproducibility warrants credibility to the results and is particularly challenging in the face of the sheer volume of data and the complexity of processing pipelines that vary widely between users.\\n\\nSeveral platforms currently exist for the design and execution of complex pipelines (e.g. Galaxy, GenePattern, GeneProf). Unfortunately, these platforms lack the necessary combination of parallelism, portability, flexibility and/or reproducibility that are required by the current research environment. To address these shortcomings, Nextflow was implemented to simplify portable, scalable, and reproducible scientific pipelines using containers. We have used Nextflow capabilities as leverage and developed a user interface, DolphinNext, for creating, deploying, and executing complex Nextflow pipelines for high throughput data processing. The guiding principle of DolphinNext is to facilitate the building and deployment of complex pipelines using a modular approach implemented in a graphical interface. DolphinNext provides: 1. A drag and drop user interface that abstracts pipelines and allows users to create pipelines without familiarity in underlying programming languages. 2. A user interface to monitor pipeline execution that allows the re-initiation of pipelines at intermediate steps 3. Reproducible pipelines with version tracking and stand-alone versions that can be run independently. 4. Seamless portability to distributed computational environments such as high-performance clusters or cloud computing environments.",

    "abstract": "Wilson Disease is a recessive genetic disorder caused by pathogenic loss-of-function variants in the ATP7B gene. It is characterized by disrupted copper homeostasis resulting in liver disease and/or neurological abnormalities. The variant NM_000053.3:c.1934T>G (Met645Arg) has been reported as compound heterozygous and is highly prevalent among Wilson Disease patients of Spanish descent. Accordingly, it is classified as pathogenic by leading molecular diagnostic centers. However, functional studies suggest that the amino acid change does not alter protein function, leading one ClinVar submitter to question its pathogenicity. Here we used a minigene system and gene-edited HepG2 cells to demonstrate that c.1934T>G causes approximately 70% skipping of exon 6. Exon 6 skipping results in frameshift and stop gain, which is expected to cause loss of ATP7B function. The elucidation of the mechanistic effect for this variant resolves any doubt about its pathogenicity and enables the development of genetic medicines for restoring correct splicing.",

    "abstract": "Many of the sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes encode regions of viral provenance. Yet, not all of these regions encode bona fide viruses. Gene transfer agents (GTAs) are thought to be former viruses that are now maintained in genomes of some bacteria and archaea and are hypothesized to enable exchange of DNA within bacterial populations. In Alphaproteobacteria, genes homologous to the  head-tail gene cluster that encodes structural components of the Rhodobacter capsulatus GTA (RcGTA) are found in many taxa, even if they are only distantly related to Rhodobacter capsulatus. Yet, in most genomes available in GenBank RcGTA-like genes have annotations of typical viral proteins, and therefore are not easily distinguished from their viral homologs without additional analyses. Here, we report a  support vector machine classifier that quickly and accurately distinguishes RcGTA-like genes from their viral homologs by capturing the differences in the amino acid composition of the encoded proteins. Our open-source classifier is implemented in Python and can be used to scan homologs of the RcGTA genes in newly sequenced genomes. The classifier can also be trained to identify other types of GTAs, or even to detect other elements of viral ancestry. Using the classifier trained on a manually curated set of homologous viruses and GTAs, we detected RcGTA-like  head-tail gene clusters in 57.5% of the 1,423 examined alphaproteobacterial genomes. We also demonstrated that more than half of the in silico prophage predictions are instead likely to be GTAs, suggesting that in many alphaproteobacterial genomes the RcGTA-like elements remain unrecognized.\\n\\nData depositionSequence alignments and phylogenetic trees are available in a FigShare repository at DOI 10.6084/m9.figshare.8796419.

In the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, there are nine BAMs which have apparently distinct functional and domain structures, although the functions of only a few of the BAMs are known and there are no 3-D structures of BAMs from this organism. Recently, AtBAM2 was proposed to form a tetramer based on chromatography and activity assays of mutants, however there was no direct observation of this tetramer. We collected small-angle X-ray scattering data on AtBAM2 and N-terminal mutants to describe the structure and assembly of the tetramer. Comparison of the scattering of the AtBAM2 tetramer to data collected using the sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) BAM5, which is also reported to form a tetramer, showed there were differences in the overall assembly. Analysis of N-terminal truncations of AtBAM2 identified a loop sequence found only in BAM2 orthologs that appears to be critical for AtBAM2 tetramer assembly as well as activity.",

    "abstract": "Memory is thought to be encoded by sparsely distributed neuronal ensembles in memory-related regions. However, it is unclear how memory-eligible neurons react incrementally during learning to encode trace fear memory, and how they respond to cues to retrieve the memory. We implemented fiber-optic confocal fluorescence endoscopy to directly visualize calcium dynamics of hippocampal CA1 neurons in freely behaving mice, which were subjected to trace fear conditioning. Here we report that the overall activity levels of CA1 principal neurons showed a right-skewed lognormal-like distribution. A small portion of highly active neurons (termed Primed Neurons) exhibited high sensitivity to sensory stimuli and marked activity plasticity. The Primed Neurons maintained random activity status for at least 5 hours in multiple contexts, including those prior to training and prior to recall. Repetitive training induced Primed Neurons to shift from random activity to a well-tuned synchronization. Importantly, the emergence of activity synchronization coincided with the appearance of mouse freezing behaviors. In recall, a partial synchronization among the same population of Primed Neurons was induced from originally random activity, which also coincided with mouse freezing behaviors. Additionally, training-induced synchronization facilitated robust calcium entry into individual Primed Neurons. In contrast, most CA1 neurons stayed silent and did not respond significantly to tone and foot-shock throughout the training and recall testing cycles. In conclusion, highly active Primed Neurons are preferably recruited to encode trace fear memory, and induction of activity synchronization among Primed Neurons out of random dynamics is critical for trace memory formation and memory retrieval.\\n\\nSignificance StatementO_LIThe overall activity levels of hippocampal principal CA1 neurons show a right-skewed lognormal-like distribution.\\nC_LIO_LIA small portion of CA1 neurons (termed Primed Neurons) exhibit high activity and marked activity plasticity during learning and recall.\\nC_LIO_LIPrimed Neurons in the hippocampus are preferably recruited to encode trace fear memory, whereas the majority of CA1 neurons show little activity and little activity change during fear conditioning and recall testing.\\nC_LIO_LIInduction of activity synchronization among Primed Neurons out of random dynamics is critical for trace memory formation and memory retrieval.\\nC_LIO_LITraining-induced synchronization drastically increases calcium entry into Primed Neurons, which may promote memory consolidation.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Measuring genome size across different species can yield important insights into evolution of the genome and allow for more informed decisions when designing next-generation genomic sequencing projects. New techniques for estimating genome size using shallow genomic sequence data have emerged which have the potential to augment our knowledge of genome sizes, yet these methods have only been used in a limited number of empirical studies. In this project, we compare estimation methods using next-generation sequencing (k-mer methods and average read depth of single-copy genes) to measurements from flow cytometry, the gold standard for genome size measures, using ground beetles (Carabidae) and other members of the beetle suborder Adephaga as our test system. We also present a new protocol for using read-depth of single-copy genes to estimate genome size. Additionally, we report flow cytometry measurements for five previously unmeasured carabid species, as well as 21 new draft genomes and six new draft transcriptomes across eight species of adephagan beetles. No single sequence-based method performed well on all species, and all tended to underestimate the genome sizes, although only slightly in most samples. For one species, Bembidion haplogonum, most sequence-based methods yielded estimates half the size suggested by flow cytometry. This discrepancy for k-mer methods can be explained by a large number of repetitive sequences, but we have no explanation for why read-depth methods yielded results that were also strikingly low.",

Salamanders (order Caudata) represent a taxonomic order in which hybridization plays a prevalent ecological and evolutionary role. We employed a recently developed model of trait-dependent diversification to test the hypothesis that hybridization impacts the diversification dynamics of species that are currently hybridizing. We find strong evidence supporting this hypothesis, showing that hybridizing salamander lineages have significantly greater net-diversification rates than non-hybridizing lineages. This pattern is driven by concurrently increased speciation rates and decreased extinction rates in hybridizing lineages. Our results support the hypothesis that hybridization can act as a generative force in macroevolutionary diversification.",

Here we demonstrate that combining sequence-based phylogenetic methods with structural information assists in making such mechanistic interpretations on a genomic scale. Our integrative analysis shows that positively selected sites tend to co-localise on protein structures and that positively selected clusters are found in functionally important regions of proteins, indicating that positive selection can contravene the well-known principle of evolutionary conservation of functionally important regions. This unexpected finding, along with our discovery that positive selection acts on structural clusters, opens new strategies for the development of better models of protein evolution. Remarkably, proteins where we detect the strongest evidence of clustering belong to just two functional groups: components of immune response and metabolic enzymes. This gives a coherent picture of immune response and xenobiotic metabolism as the drivers of adaptive evolution of mammals.",

    "abstract": "Novel pathogens can cause massive declines in populations, and even extirpation of hosts. But disease can also act as a selective pressure on survivors, driving the evolution of resistance or tolerance. Bat white-nose syndrome (WNS) is a rapidly spreading wildlife disease in North America. The fungus causing the disease invades skin tissues of hibernating bats, resulting in disruption of hibernation behavior, premature energy depletion, and subsequent death. We used whole-genome sequencing to investigate changes in allele frequencies within a population of Myotis lucifugus in eastern North America to search for genetic resistance to WNS. Our results show low FST values within the population across time, i.e. prior to WNS (Pre-WNS) compared to the population that has survived WNS (Post-WNS). However, when dividing the population with a geographical cut-off between the states of Pennsylvania and New York, a sharp increase in values on scaffold GL429776 is evident in the Post-WNS samples. Genes present in the diverged area are associated with thermoregulation and promotion of brown fat production. Thus, although WNS may not have subjected the entire M. lucifugus population to selective pressure, it may have selected for specific alleles in Pennsylvania through decreased gene flow within the population. However, the persistence of remnant sub-populations in the aftermath of WNS is likely due to multiple factors in bat life history.",

    "abstract": "Some individuals with chronic pain experience improvement in their pain with treatment, whereas others do not. The neurobiological reason is unclear, but an understanding of brain structure and functional patterns may provide insights into pains responsivity to treatment. In this investigation, we used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to determine grey matter density alterations on resting functional connectivity (RFC) strengths between pain responders and nonresponders. Brain metrics of pediatric patients at admission to an intensive pain rehabilitative treatment program were evaluated. Pain responders reported significant pain improvement at discharge and/or follow-up whereas nonresponders reported no improvements, increases in pain, or emergence of new pain symptoms. The pain (responder/nonresponder) groups were compared with pain-free healthy controls to examine predictors of pain responder status via brain metrics. Our results show: (1) on admission, pain nonresponders had decreased grey matter density (GMD) within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and reduced RFC strength between the NAc and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex vs. responders; (2) Connectivity strength was positively correlated with change in pain intensity from admission to discharge; (3) Compared with pain-free controls, grey matter and RFC differences emerged only among pain nonresponders; and (4) Using a discriminative model, combining GMD and RFC strengths assessed at admission showed the highest prediction estimate (87%) on potential for pain improvement, warranting testing in a de novo sample. Taken together, these results support the idea that treatment responsiveness on pain is underpinned by concurrent brain structure and resting brain activity.",

However, as popular clustering methods operate largely independently of visualization techniques, the fine-tuning of clustering parameters can be unintuitive and time-consuming. Here, I propose Galapagos, a simple and effective clustering workflow based on t-SNE and DBSCAN that does not require a gene selection step. In practice, Galapagos only involves the fine-tuning of two parameters, which is straightforward, as clustering is performed directly on the t-SNE visualization results. Using peripheral blood mononuclear cells as a model tissue, I validate the effectiveness of Galapagos in different ways. First, I show that Galapagos generates clusters corresponding to all main cell types present. Then, I demonstrate that the t-SNE results are robust to parameter choices and initialization points. Next, I employ a simulation approach to show that clustering with Galapagos is accurate and robust to the high levels of technical noise present. Finally, to demonstrate Galapagos accuracy on real data, I compare clustering results to true cell type identities established using CITE-Seq data. In this context, I also provide an example of the primary limitation of Galapagos, namely the difficulty to resolve related cell types in cases where t-SNE fails to clearly separate the cells. Galapagos helps to make clustering scRNA-Seq data more intuitive and reproducible, and can be implemented in most programming languages with only a few lines of code.",

Understanding the role of this process in vivo has been slowed by the lack of readily accessible model systems. Exposing the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to the polyunsaturated fatty acid dihomogamma-linolenic acid (DGLA; 20:3n-6) causes germ cell death and sterility that is largely independent of the canonical apoptosis pathway. Here we demonstrate that DGLA-induced germ cell death is modulated by small molecule ferroptosis inhibitors, genetic manipulation of ferritin, NADPH oxidase, and glutathione peroxidases, and by dietary co-supplementation with oleic acid. Thus, DGLA-induced germ cell death in C. elegans is highly analogous to ferroptosis in mammalian cells. DGLA can also induce ferroptosis in human cells, further highlighting this omega-6 PUFA as a metabolic instigator of ferroptosis. Together, these results establish C. elegans as a powerful animal model to study the induction and modulation of ferroptosis by dietary fats.\\n\\nHighlights- Dietary dihomogamma-linolenic acid (DGLA)-induced germ cell death in C. elegans is alleviated by small molecule antioxidants and iron chelators\\n- Dietary and endogenous oleic acid protects from DGLA-induced ferroptosis\\n- Ether-lipid deficiency increases sensitivity to DGLA-induced ferroptosis\\n- DGLA specifically induces ferroptosis in human cancer cells",

    "abstract": "The insulin superfamily proteins (ISPs), in particular, insulin, IGFs and relaxins are key modulators of animal physiology. They are known to have evolved from the same ancestral gene and have diverged into proteins with varied sequences and distinct functions, but maintain a similar structural architecture stabilized by highly conserved disulphide bridges. A recent surge of sequence data and the structures of these proteins prompted a need for a comprehensive analysis which connects the evolution of these sequences in the light of available functional and structural information and their interaction with cognate receptors. This study reveals a) unusually high sequence conservation of IGFs (>90%), which has never been reported before. In fact, it was interesting to observe that the functional domains (excluding signal peptide) of human, horse, pig and Ords kangaroo rat are 100% identical. (b) an updated definition of the signature motif of the relaxin family (c) a non-canonical C-peptide cleavage site in a few killifish insulin sequences and so on. We also provide a structure-based rationale for such conservation by introducing a concept called binding partners imposed evolutionary constraints. Furthermore, the high conservation of IGFs appears to represent a classic case of resistance to sequence diversity exerted by physiologically important interactions with multiple partners.

    "abstract": "AbstractsIdiopathy pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an intractable and fatal human disorder. Our previous study showed that eupatilin exerted a potent anti-fibrotic effect on both in vitro fibrogenesis and bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis model (BLM). Subsequently, an analog called ONG41008 had been identified as a more potent anti-fibrotic than eupatilin and also showed a potent anti-inflammatory capability. Orally administered ONG41008 significantly improved onset of BLM in both prophylactic and therapeutic model and its therapeutic efficacy was similarly compared to or better than pirfenidone by measuring production of collagen and hydroxyproline. Staining collagen or SMA corroborated these results.\n\nAs in vitro fibrogenesis models, DHLF (Diseased Human Lung Fibroblasts from IPF patients) and HSC (hepatic stellate cells) were used for direct effects of ONG41008 on pivotal cellular and molecular functions associated with pathogenic myofibroblasts; ONG41008 dismantled latent TGFb complex (LTC), generating inactive forms of TGF{beta}, likely limiting TGF{beta} to TGF{beta} receptor via depolymerization of F-actin and this blunted SMAD2/SMAD3 phosphorylation, thereby reprogramming EMT. A set of cell imaging studies and transcriptomic analysis were conducted to explore how ONG41008 elicited both anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory capabilities. Elastin (ELN) seemed to be a pioneering pharmacodynamic marker. It was also found that NOX4 played an important role in anti- fibrosis because it was functionally connected to major central nod proteins such as lysyl- oxidase (LOX) and numerous collagen family members in an ONG41008-specific fibrogenic interactome. Human NOX4 was significantly induced by TGF{beta} and completely knocked down by ONG41008. It has been shown that production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) led to activation of inflammasome. ONG41008 may be likely related to anti-inflammation, leading to a key protective effect on fibrogenesis. Concomitant with downregulation of NOX4, expression of macrophages homing chemokines, CCL2 and CCL7 were significantly attenuated by ONG41008. In vitro anti-inflammatory activities of ONG41008 were investigated in RAW264.7 cells, a mouse monocytic cell line stimulated with LPS. ONG41008 substantially attenuated TNF, CXCL10, CCL2 and CCL7, which are proinflammatory cytokine and important chemokines influencing T cells or macrophages. TNF was situated at the central nod in LPS-treated macrophages via an ONG41008-specific interactome analysis.\n\nTaken together, ONG41008 is a TGF{beta} biogenesis inhibitor, being a potent drug for a broad range of fibrotic diseases and could antagonize inflammatory diseases as well.",

    "abstract": "Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) belong to a class of ion channels involved in fast synaptic signaling in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Molecules acting as allosteric modulators target binding sites that are remote from the neurotransmitter binding site, but functionally affect coupling of ligand binding to channel opening. Here, we investigated an allosteric binding site in the ion channel vestibule, which has converged from a series of studies on prokaryote and eukaryote channel homologs. We discovered single domain antibodies, called nanobodies, which are functionally active as allosteric modulators, and solved co-crystal structures of the prokaryote channel ELIC bound either to a positive (PAM) or a negative (NAM) allosteric modulator. We extrapolate the functional importance of the vestibule binding site to eukaryote ion channels, suggesting a conserved mechanism of allosteric modulation. This work identifies key elements of allosteric binding sites and extends drug design possibilities in pLGICs using nanobodies.",

Despite this, transcriptional definition of cell populations that comprise both the medial (MHb) and lateral habenular (LHb) subregions in mammals remain undefined. To resolve this, we performed single-cell transcriptional profiling and highly multiplexed in situ hybridization experiments of the mouse habenula complex in naive mice and those exposed to an acute aversive stimulus. Transcriptionally distinct neuronal cell types identified within the MHb and LHb, were spatially defined, and differentially engaged by aversive stimuli. Cell types identified in mice, also displayed a high degree of transcriptional similarity to those previously described in zebrafish, highlighting the well conserved nature of habenular cell types across the phylum. These data identify key molecular targets within habenula cell types, and provide a critical resource for future studies.",

    "abstract": "The promotion of structural and functional plasticity by estrogens is a promising therapy to enhance central nervous system function in the aged. However, how the sensitivity to estrogens is regulated across brain regions, age and experience is poorly understood. To ask if estradiol treatment impacts structural and functional plasticity in sensory cortices, we examined the acute effect of 17 Estradiol in adult Long Evans (LE) rats following chronic monocular deprivation, a manipulation that reduces the strength and selectivity of deprived eye vision. Chronic monocular deprivation decreased thalamic input from the deprived eye to the binocular visual cortex and accelerated short-term depression of the deprived eye pathway, without changing the total density of excitatory synapses. Importantly, we found that the classical estrogen receptors ER and ER{beta} are robustly expressed in the adult visual cortex, and that a single dose of 17 Estradiol increased the size of excitatory postsynaptic densities, reduced the expression of parvalbumin and decreased the integrity of the extracellular matrix. Furthermore, 17 Estradiol enhanced experience-dependent plasticity in the amblyopic visual cortex, and promoted response potentiation of the pathway served by the non-deprived eye. The promotion of plasticity at synapses serving the non-deprived eye may reflect selectivity for synapses with an initially low probability of neurotransmitter release, and may inform applications to remap spared inputs around a scotoma or a cortical infarct",

    "abstract": "Methods for one-photon fluorescent imaging of calcium dynamics in vivo are popular due to their ability to simultaneously capture the dynamics of hundreds of neurons across large fields of view, at a low equipment complexity and cost. In contrast to two-photon methods, however, one-photon methods suffer from higher levels of crosstalk between cell bodies and the surrounding neuropil, resulting in decreased signal-to-noise and artifactual correlations of neural activity. Here, we address this problem by engineering cell body-targeted variants of the fluorescent calcium indicator GCaMP6f. We screened fusions of GCaMP6f to both natural as well as engineered peptides, and identified fusions that localized GCaMP6f to within approximately 50 microns of the cell body of neurons in live mice and larval zebrafish. One-photon imaging of soma-targeted GCaMP6f in dense neural circuits reported fewer artifactual spikes from neuropil, increased signal-to-noise ratio, and decreased artifactual correlation across neurons. Thus, soma-targeting of fluorescent calcium indicators increases neuronal signal fidelity and may facilitate even greater usage of simple, powerful, one-photon methods of population imaging of neural calcium dynamics.",

    "abstract": "The experience-dependent decrease in stimulus detection thresholds that underly perceptual learning can be induced by repetitive exposure to a visual stimulus. Robust stimulus-selective potentiation of visual responses is induced in the primary mouse visual cortex by repetitive low frequency visual stimulation (LFVS). How the parameters of the repetitive visual stimulus impact the site and specificity of this experience-dependent plasticity is currently a subject of debate. Here we demonstrate that the stimulus selective response potentiation induced by repetitive low frequency (1 Hz) stimulation, which is typically limited to layer 4, shifts to superficial layers following manipulations that enhance plasticity in primary visual cortex. In contrast, repetitive high frequency (10 Hz) visual stimulation induces response potentiation that is expressed in layers 4 and 5/6, and generalizes to novel visual stimuli. Repetitive visual stimulation also induces changes in the magnitude and distribution of oscillatory activity in primary visual cortex, however changes in oscillatory power do not predict the locus or specificity of response potentiation. Instead we find that robust response potentiation is induced by visual stimulation that resets the phase of ongoing gamma oscillations. Furthermore, high frequency, but not low frequency, repetitive visual stimulation entrains oscillatory rhythms with enhanced sensitivity to phase reset, such that familiar and novel visual stimuli induce similar visual response potentiation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundType 2 diabetes develops for many years before diagnosis. We aimed to reveal early metabolic features characterising liability to adult disease by examining genetic liability to adult type 2 diabetes in relation to detailed metabolic traits across early life.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsData were from up to 4,761 offspring from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort. Linear models were used to examine effects of a genetic risk score (GRS, including 162 variants) for adult type 2 diabetes on 4 repeated measures of 229 traits from targeted nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics. These traits included lipoprotein subclass-specific cholesterol and triglyceride content, amino and fatty acids, inflammatory glycoprotein acetyls, and others, and were measured in childhood (age 8y), adolescence (age 16y), young-adulthood (age 18y), and adulthood (age 25y). For replication, two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was conducted using summary data from genome-wide association studies of metabolic traits from NMR in an independent sample of adults (N range 13,476 to 24,925; mean (SD) age range 23.9y (2.1y) to 61.3y (2.9y)). Among ALSPAC participants (49.7% male), the prevalence of type 2 diabetes was very low across time points (< 5 cases when first assessed at age 16y; 7 cases (0.4%) when assessed at age 25y). At age 8y, type 2 diabetes liability (per SD-higher GRS) was associated with lower lipids in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particle subtypes - e.g. -0.03 SD (95% CI = -0.06, -0.003; P = 0.03) for total lipids in very-large HDL. At age 16y, associations remained strongest with lower lipids in HDL and became stronger with pre-glycemic traits including citrate (-0.06 SD, 95% CI = -0.09, -0.02; P = 1.41x10-03) and with glycoprotein acetyls (0.05 SD, 95% CI = 0.01, 0.08; P = 0.01). At age 18y, associations were stronger with branched chain amino acids including valine (0.06 SD; 95% CI = 0.02, 0.09; P = 1.24x10-03), while at age 25y, associations had strengthened with VLDL lipids and remained consistent with previously altered traits including HDL lipids. Results of two-sample MR in an independent sample of adults indicated persistent patterns of effect of type 2 diabetes liability, with higher type 2 diabetes liability positively associated with VLDL lipids and branched chain amino acid levels, and inversely associated with HDL lipids - again for large and very large HDL particularly (-0.004 SD (95% CI = -0.007, -0.002; P = 8.45x10-04) per 1 log odds of type 2 diabetes for total lipids in large HDL). Study limitations include modest sample sizes for ALSPAC analyses and limited coverage of protein and hormonal traits; insulin was absent as it is not quantified by NMR and not consistently available at each time point. Analyses were restricted to white-Europeans which reduced confounding by population structure but limited inference to other ethnic groups.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results support perturbed HDL lipid metabolism as one of the earliest features of type 2 diabetes liability which precedes higher branched chain amino acid and inflammatory glycoprotein acetyl levels. This feature is apparent in childhood as early as age 8y, decades before the clinical onset of disease.\\n\\nAuthor summaryO_ST_ABSWhy was this study done?C_ST_ABSO_LIType 2 diabetes develops for many years before diagnosis. Clinical disease is characterised by numerous metabolic perturbations that are detectable in circulation, but which of these reflect the developmental stages of type 2 diabetes - as opposed to independent causes of type 2 diabetes or markers of other disease processes - is unknown. Revealing traits specific to type 2 diabetes development could inform the targeting of key pathways to prevent the clinical onset of disease and its complications.\\nC_LIO_LIGenetic liability to type 2 diabetes is less prone to confounding than measured type 2 diabetes or blood glucose and may help reveal early perturbations in the blood that arise in response to type 2 diabetes liability itself.\\nC_LI\\n\\nWhat did the researchers do and find?O_LIWe examined effects of genetic liability to adult type 2 diabetes, based on a genetic risk score including 162 variants, on detailed metabolic traits measured on the same individuals across four stages of early life - childhood (age 8y), adolescence (age 16y), young-adulthood (age 18y), and adulthood (age 25y).\\nC_LIO_LIWe found that higher type 2 diabetes liability was associated most consistently across ages with lower lipid content in certain subtypes of HDL particles. Effects were more gradual on higher lipid content in VLDL particles and on higher branched chain amino acid and inflammatory glycoprotein acetyl levels.\\nC_LI\\n\\nWhat do these findings mean?O_LISigns of type 2 diabetes liability are detectable in the blood in childhood, decades before the disease becomes noticeable. These signs, taken to reflect the early features of, or coincident with, disease, likely involve lower lipid content in HDL particles, followed by higher levels of branched chain amino acids and inflammation.\\nC_LIO_LIGenetic risk scores for adult diseases can be integrated with metabolic measurements taken earlier in life to help to reveal the timing at which signs of disease liability become visible and the traits most central to its development.\\nC_LI",

The survival rate of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) were investigated by flat mount analysis and flow cytometry. A group of male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to five groups: negative control, NMDA80 (i.e., 80 nmoles NDMA intravitreally injected), NMDA80 + 10ng EPO, NMDA80 + 50ng EPO, and NMDA80 + 250ng EPO. The NMDA80 + 50ng EPO treatment group was used to evaluate various administrated points (pre-/co-/post-administration of NMDA80). Meanwhile, the transferase dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) assay of RGCs, the inner plexiform layer (IPL) thickness and the apoptotic signal transduction pathways of -calpain, Bax, and caspase 9 were assessed simultaneously using an immunohistochemical method (IHC). When EPO was co-administered with NMDA, attenuated cell death occurred through the downregulation of the apoptotic indicators: -calpain was activated first (peak at [~]18hrs), followed by Bax and caspase 9 (peak at [~]40hrs). Furthermore, the morphology of RGCs has clearly demonstrated the visual recovery of IPL thickness at 40 hours after injection. Exogenous EPO successfully protected RGCs by downregulating apoptotic factors to attenuate NMDA-mediated excitotoxic retinal damage.",

    "abstract": "Background and purposeHandling missing values is a prevalent challenge in the analysis of clinical data. The rise of data-driven models demands an efficient use of the available data. Methods to impute missing values are thus crucial. Here, we developed a publicly available framework to test different imputation methods and compared their impact in a typical stroke clinical dataset as a use case.\\n\\nMethodsA clinical dataset based on the 1000Plus stroke study with 380 completed-entries patients was used. 13 common clinical parameters including numerical and categorical values were selected. Missing values in a missing-at-random (MAR) and missing-completely-at-random (MCAR) fashion from 0% to 60% were simulated and consequently imputed using the mean, hot-deck, multiple imputation by chained equations, expectation maximization method and listwise deletion. The performance was assessed by the root mean squared error, the absolute bias and the performance of a linear model for discharge mRS prediction.\\n\\nResultsListwise deletion was the worst performing method and started to be significantly worse than any imputation method from 2% (MAR) and 3% (MCAR) missing values on. The underlying missing value mechanism seemed to have a crucial influence on the identified best performing imputation method. Consequently no single imputation method outperformed all others. A significant performance drop of the linear model started from 11% (MAR+MCAR) and 18% (MCAR) missing values.\\n\\nConclusionsIn the presented case study of a typical clinical stroke dataset we confirmed that listwise deletion should be avoided for dealing with missing values. Our findings indicate that the underlying missing value mechanism and other dataset characteristics strongly influence the best choice of imputation method. For future studies with similar data structure, we thus suggest to use the developed framework in this study to select the most suitable imputation method for a given dataset prior to analysis.",
