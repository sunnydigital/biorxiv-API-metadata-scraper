    "abstract": "Targeting T-cells against cancer cells is a direct means of treating cancer, and already showed great responses in clinical treatment of B-cell malignancies. A simple way to redirect T-cells to cancer cells is using multi-specific antibody (MsAb) that contains different arms for specifically \\\"grabbing\\\" the T-cells and cancer cells; as such, the T-cells are activated upon target engagement and the killing begins. Here, a Nucleic Acid mediated Protein-Protein Assembly (NAPPA) approach is implemented to construct a MsAb for T-cell engaging and tumor killing. Anti -CD19 and -CD3 single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) each are conjugated to different L-DNAs with sequences that form the Holliday junction, thus allowing spontaneous assembly of homogeneous protein-DNA oligomers containing two anti-CD19 and one anti-CD3 scFvs. The new MsAb shows strong efficacy in inducing Raji tumor cell cytotoxicity in the presence of T-cells with EC50 ~ 0.2 nM; it also suppresses tumor growth in the Raji xenograft mouse model. The data indicate that MsAbs assembled from protein-DNA conjugates are effective macromolecules for directing T-cells for tumor killing. The modular nature of the NAPPA platform allows rapid generation of complex MsAbs from simple antibody fragments, while offering a general solution for preparing antibodies with high-order specificity.",

They possess structurally and functionally different processes, axon and dendrites, to mediate information flow through the nervous system. Although it is well known that the microtubule cytoskeleton has a central role in establishing neuronal polarity, how its specific organization is established and maintained is little understood.\\n\\nUsing the in vivo model system Caenorhabditis elegans, we found that the highly conserved UNC-119 protein provides a link between the membrane-associated Ankyrin (UNC-44) and the microtubule-associated CRMP (UNC-33). Together they form a periodic membrane-associated complex that anchors axonal and dendritic microtubule bundles to the cell cortex. This anchoring is critical to maintain microtubule organization by opposing kinesin-1 powered microtubule sliding. Disturbing this molecular complex alters neuronal polarity and causes strong developmental defects of the nervous system leading to severely paralyzed animals.",

    "abstract": "Most mammalian genomes are diploid and previous studies have extensively investigated the average epigenetic profiles of homologous chromosomes. Here we use hybrid mice to distinguish the epigenetic status and three-dimensional organization of homologous chromosomes. We generated Hi-C, ChIP-seq and RNA-seq datasets from CD4 T cells of B6, Cast and hybrid mice, respectively, and systematically analyzed the 3D nucleus organization and epigenetic regulation. Our data indicate that the inter-chromosomal interaction patterns between homologous chromosomes are similar and the similarity is highly correlated with their allelic co-expression levels. Construction of 3D nucleus based on allele-specific interaction frequency revealed symmetric positioning of homologous chromosomes in the 3D nuclear space. The inter-chromosomal interactions at centromeres are significantly weaker than those at telomeres, indicating positioning of centromeres toward the inside of chromosome territories and telomeres toward the surface of chromosome territories. The majority A|B compartments or topologically associated domains (TADs) are consistent between B6 and Cast. We found 58% of the haploids in hybrids maintain their parental compartment status at B6/Cast divergent compartments due to cis-effect. About 95% of the trans-effected B6/Cast divergent compartments converge to same compartment status potentially due to a shared cellular environment. We found the differentially expressed genes between the two haploids in hybrid were associated with either genetic associated cis-effects or epigenetic associated trans-effects. The widespread epigenetic differences between B6 and Cast suggest that epigenetic changes may be major contributors to differences between B6 and Cast. Our data revealed symmetrical positioning of homologous chromosomes in 3D nucleus and enhanced our understanding of allele-specific epigenetic regulation.",

    "abstract": "Peptidase-containing ABC transporters (PCATs) are a widely distributed family of transporters which secrete double-glycine (GG) peptides. In the opportunistic pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), the PCATs ComAB and BlpAB have been shown to secrete quorum-sensing pheromones and bacteriocins related to the competence and pneumocin pathways. Here, we describe another pneumococcal PCAT, RtgAB, encoded by the rtg locus and found intact in 17% of strains. The Rgg/SHP-like quorum sensing system RtgR/S, which uses a peptide pheromone with a distinctive Trp-X-Trp motif, regulates expression of the rtg locus and provides a competitive fitness advantage in a mouse model of nasopharyngeal colonization. RtgAB secretes a set of co-regulated rtg GG peptides. ComAB and BlpAB, which share a substrate pool with each other, do not secrete the rtg GG peptides. Similarly, RtgAB does not efficiently secrete ComAB/BlpAB substrates. We examined the molecular determinants of substrate selectivity between ComAB, BlpAB, and RtgAB and found that the GG peptide signal sequences contain all the information necessary to direct secretion through specific transporters. Secretion through ComAB and BlpAB depends largely on the identity of four conserved hydrophobic signal sequence residues previously implicated in substrate recognition by PCATs. In contrast, a motif situated at the N-terminal end of the signal sequence, found only in rtg GG peptides, directs secretion through RtgAB. These findings illustrate the complexity in predicting substrate-PCAT pairings by demonstrating specificity that is not dictated solely by signal sequence residues previously implicated in substrate recognition.\\n\\nImportanceThe export of peptides from the cell is a fundamental process carried out by all bacteria. One method of bacterial peptide export relies on a family of transporters called peptidase-containing ABC transporters (PCATs). PCATs export so-called GG peptides which carry out diverse functions, including cell-to-cell communication and inter-bacterial competition. In this work, we describe a PCAT-encoding genetic locus, rtg, in the pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). The rtg locus is linked to increased competitive fitness advantage in a mouse model of nasopharyngeal colonization. We also describe how the rtg PCAT preferentially secretes a set of co-regulated GG peptides but not GG peptides secreted by other pneumococcal PCATs. These findings illuminate a relatively understudied part of PCAT biology: how these transporters discriminate between different subsets of GG peptides. Ultimately, expanding our knowledge of PCATs will advance our understanding of the many microbial processes dependent on these transporters.",

    "abstract": "Vector-borne flaviviruses are emerging threats to human health. For successful transmission, the virus needs to efficiently enter mosquito cells, replicate within, and escape several tissue barriers while mosquitoes elicit major transcriptional responses to flavivirus infection. This process will not only be affected by the specific mosquito-pathogen pairing, but also variation in key environmental variables such as temperature. Thus far, few studies have examined the molecular responses triggered by temperature and how these responses modify infection outcomes despite substantial evidence showing strong relationships between temperature and transmission in a diversity of systems. To define the host transcriptional changes associated with temperature variation during the early infection process, we compared the transcriptome of mosquito midgut samples from mosquitoes exposed to Zika virus (ZIKV) and non-exposed mosquitoes housed at three different temperatures (20, 28, and 36{degrees}C). While the high temperature samples did not have significant changes from standard rearing conditions (28{degrees}C) 48 hr post-exposure, the transcriptome profile of mosquitoes housed at 20{degrees}C was dramatically different. The expression of genes most altered by the cooler temperature involved aspects of blood-meal digestion, ROS metabolism, and mosquito innate immunity. Further, we did not find significant differences in the viral RNA copy number between 24 and 48 hr post-exposure at 20{degrees}C, suggesting ZIKV replication is limited by cold-induced changes to the mosquito midgut environment. In ZIKV-exposed mosquitoes, vitellogenin, a lipid carrier protein, was the most up-regulated at 20{degrees}C. Our results provide a deeper understanding of the temperature-triggered transcriptional changes in Aedes aegypti and can be used to further define the molecular mechanisms driven by environmental temperature variation.\\n\\nContribution to the Field StatementA variety of methods for engineering refractory mosquitoes are currently being studied and show promise for disease control. Although considerable effort has been put into understanding the immune system of mosquitoes in response to infections, almost nothing is understood about environmental influences in regulating these responses. Here, we used RNA sequencing to study the effect of temperature on the mosquito transcriptome profile, as well as assess the changes in the immune response to ZIKV infection at three different temperatures. We found a remarkable effect of temperature on the transcriptome profile of mosquitoes exposed to cool conditions (20{degrees}C) after imbibing a blood meal, as well as accumulation of transcripts involved with different mechanisms associated with blood meal digestion, metabolism, and some components of the immune response in mosquitoes. Our results provide new insights in potential mechanisms that limit temperature-driven pathogen establishment and replication within the mosquito vector.",

    "abstract": "The coxibs are a subset of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that primarily target cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) to inhibit prostaglandin signaling and reduce inflammation. However, mechanisms to inhibit other members of the prostaglandin signaling pathway may improve selectivity and reduce off-target toxicity. Here, we report a novel binding site for celecoxib on prostaglandin E synthase (PTGES), an enzyme downstream of COX-2 in the prostaglandin signaling pathway, using a cleavable chelation-assisted biotin probe 6. Evaluation of the multi-functional probe 6 revealed significantly improved tagging efficiencies attributable to the embedded picolyl functional group. Application of the probe 6 within the small molecule interactome mapping by photo-affinity labeling (SIM-PAL) platform using photo-celecoxib as a reporter for celecoxib identified PTGES and other membrane proteins in the top eight enriched proteins from A549 cells. Carbonic anhydrase 12, a known protein target of celecoxib, was also enriched. Four binding sites to photo-celecoxib were additionally mapped by the probe 6, including a binding site with PTGES. The binding interaction with PTGES was validated by competitive displacement with celecoxib and known PTGES inhibitor licofelone. The binding site of photo-celecoxib on PTGES enabled the development of a structural model of the interaction and will inform the design of new selective inhibitors of the prostaglandin signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Several types of drug-resistant epileptic encephalopathies of infancy have been associated with mutations in the KCNT1 gene, which encodes the sodium-activated potassium channel subunit KNa1.1. These mutations are commonly gain-of-function, increasing channel activity, therefore inhibition by drugs is proposed as a stratified approach to treat disorders. To date, quinidine therapy has been trialled with several patients, but mostly with unsuccessful outcomes, which has been linked to its low potency and lack of specificity. Here we describe the use of a cryo-electron microscopy-derived KNa1.1 structure and mutational analysis to identify the quinidine biding site and identified novel inhibitors that target this site using computational methods. We describe six compounds that inhibit KNa1.1 channels with low- and sub-micromolar potencies, likely through binding in the intracellular pore vestibule. In preliminary hERG inhibition and cytotoxicity assays, two compounds showed little effect. These compounds may provide starting points for the development of novel pharmacophores for KNa1.1 inhibition, with the view to treating KCNT1-associated epilepsy and, with their potencies higher than quinidine, could become key tool compounds to further study this channel. Furthermore, this study illustrates the potential for utilising cryo-electron microscopy in ion channel drug discovery.",

We provide a web-based visualization interface to generate and present the resulting age trends, enabling future studies of brain structure to compare their data with this normative reference of brain development and aging, and to examine deviations from normative ranges, potentially related to disease.",

This nanobody potently activates the Hedgehog pathway in vitro and in vivo by stabilizing an alternative conformation of a Patched1 \\\"switch helix\\\", as revealed by cryo-EM structure determination. Although this conformation likely constitutes part of the transport cycle, nanobody-trapping disrupts the cycle and prevents substrate movement through the Patched1 sterol conduit.

However, proneural mutants only display partial NB reduction, indicating the existence of additional genes with proneural activity. In addition, recent studies reveal involvement of key epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes in NB selection, but the regulatory interplay between Notch signalling and the EMT machinery is unclear. We find that the SoxB gene SoxNeuro and the Snail gene worniou are integrated with the Notch pathway, and constitute the missing proneural genes. Notch signalling, the proneural, SoxNeuro, and worniou genes regulate key EMT genes to orchestrate the NB specification process. Hence, we uncover an expanded lateral inhibition network for NB specification, and demonstrate its link to key players in the EMT machinery. Because of the evolutionary conservation of the genes involved, the Notch-SoxB-Snail-EMT network may control neural progenitor selection in many other systems.",

For example, cooperative interactions may allow populations to maintain high densities, and thus keep track of moving environmental optima. At the same time, changes in population density alter the marginal benefits of cooperative investments, creating a feedback loop between population dynamics and the evolution of cooperation. Here we model how the evolution of cooperation is affected by, and in turn affects, adaptation to a changing environment. We hypothesize that changes in the environment lower population size and thus promote the evolution of cooperation, and that this in turn helps the population keep up with the moving optimum. However, we find that the evolution of cooperation can have qualitatively different effects, depending on which fitness component is reduced by the costs of cooperation. If the costs decrease fecundity, cooperation indeed speeds adaptation by increasing population density; if, in contrast, the costs decrease viability, cooperation may in fact slow adaptation by lowering the effective population size, leading to evolutionary suicide. Thus, we show that cooperation can either promote or--counter-intuitively--hinder adaptation to a changing environment.",

In particular, by identifying homozygous protein truncating variants (hPTVs) in genes hypothesized to play a role in causing human diseases, it may be possible to elucidate mechanisms for the phenotypic impact of such variants through investigations that are infeasible in humans. The Caribbean vervet (Chlorocebus aethiops sabaeus) is uniquely valuable for this purpose, as the dramatic expansion of its population following severe bottlenecks has enabled PTVs that passed through the bottleneck to attain a relatively high frequency. Using whole genome sequence (WGS) data from 719 monkeys of the Vervet Research Colony (VRC) extended pedigree, we found 2,802 protein-truncating alleles in 1,747 protein-coding genes present in homozygous state in at least one monkey. Polymorphic sites for 923 SNV hPTVs were also observed in natural Caribbean populations from which the VRC descends.

Recent evolutionary divergence, however, can often lead to ambiguity in morphological and genetic differentiation, complicating the delineation of valid conservation units. Such is the case with the \\\"coregonine problem,\\\" where recent post-glacial radiations of coregonines into lacustrine habitats resulted in the evolution of numerous species flocks, often with ambiguous taxonomy. The application of genomics methods is beginning to shed light on this problem and the evolutionary mechanisms underlying divergence in these ecologically and economically important fishes. Here, we used restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing to examine genetic diversity and differentiation among sympatric species in the Coregonus artedi complex in the Apostle Islands of Lake Superior, the largest lake in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Using 29,068 SNPs, we were not only able to clearly distinguish the three most common forms for the first time, but putative hybrids and potentially mis-identified specimens as well. Assignment rates to form with our RAD data were 93-100% with the only mis-assignments arising from putative F1 hybrids, an improvement from 62-77% using microsatellites. Estimates of pairwise differentiation (FST: 0.045-0.056) were large given the detection of hybrids, suggesting that hybridization among forms may not be successful beyond the F1 state. We also used a newly built C. artedi linkage map to look for islands of adaptive genetic divergence among forms and found widespread differentiation across the genome, a pattern indicative of long-term drift, suggesting that these forms have been reproductively isolated for a substantial amount of time. The results of this study provide valuable information that can be applied to develop well-informed management strategies and stress the importance of re-evaluating conservation units with genomic tools to ensure they accurately reflect species diversity.",

    "abstract": "TEMPO nanofibrillated cellulose (TNFC), nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), and lignin were used as templates for the addition of two well-known antimicrobial substances, benzalkonium chloride (BZK) and copper. The resulting hybrid of cellulose and antimicrobial materials were analyzed for biocidal activity in three separate products. Assays of the nanocellulose-antimicrobials were assayed for viability against Escherichia coli in suspension, against Saccharomyces cerevisiae on PVA plastic, and against bacillus lincheniformis in paper additives. Instant biocidal activity was achieved with a minimal inhibitory concentration of 0.116 M BZK-TNFC hybrid suspension. BZK-Lignin and BZK-CMC suspensions demonstrated increased antimicrobial activity with longer exposure times during a 24-hour exposure which completely inhibited the bacteria. BZK was slowly released into the suspension, a desirable trait for long-term antimicrobial activity. PVA plastic incorporated with BZK/Cu-nanocellulose scaffolds created solid films that completely inhibited yeast growth by 270 seconds. Interestingly, lignin-BZK PVA films counteracted each other and showed no biocidal activity at all. The multiple combinations of nanocellulose and biocidal agents in the surface viability assay demonstrates the importance of synergy between both components in designing nanocellulose antimicrobials. TNFC-Cu was more suited to inhibit growth in paper than NFC-Cu as seen in a zone of inhibition assay. The most potent biocidal material in PVA was NFC-BZK. Here we show the diversity of the cellulosic derivatives and their impact on the antimicrobial additive. We employed a variety of assays to assess to biocidal of these nanoparticles against three species of bacteria and yeast relevant to food packaging and medical fields. From our study, there are many factors that play a role in the design of antimicrobial materials; cellulose derivative scaffold, antimicrobial agent, type of final material in which to be incorporated, target organism, and duration of application.",

    "abstract": "Purinergic receptors detect extracellular ATP and promote inflammatory processes. Emerging literature has demonstrated that inhibition of these proinflammatory receptors can block HIV-1 productive infection. The specificity of receptor type and mechanism of interaction has not yet been determined. Here we characterize the inhibitory activity of P2X1 receptor antagonists, NF279 and NF449 in cell lines, primary cells, and in a variety of envelope clades. NF279 and NF449 blocked productive infection at the level of viral membrane fusion with a range of inhibitory activities against different HIV-1 envelopes. A mutant virus carrying a truncation deletion of the C-terminal tail of HIV-1 envelope (Env) glycoprotein 41 (gp41) showed reduced sensitivity to P2X1 antagonists, indicating that the sensitivity of inhibition by these molecules is modulated by Env conformation. By contrast, a P2X7 antagonist, A438079, had limited effect on productive infection and fusion. Inhibition with NF449 interfered with the ability of the V1V2 targeted broadly neutralizing antibody PG9 to block productive infection, suggesting that these drugs may antagonize HIV-1 Env at gp120 V1V2 to block viral membrane fusion. Our observations indicate that P2X1 antagonism can inhibit HIV-1 replication at the level of viral membrane fusion through interaction with Env. Future studies will probe the nature of these compounds in inhibiting HIV-1 fusion and in development of a different class of small molecules to block HIV-1 entry.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEWhile effective treatment can lower the severe morbidity and mortality associated with HIV-1 infection, patients infected with HIV-1 suffer from significantly higher rates of non-communicable comorbidities associated with chronic inflammation. Emerging literature suggests a key role for P2X1 receptors in mediating this chronic inflammation but the mechanism is still unknown. Here, we demonstrate that HIV-1 infection is reduced by P2X1 receptor antagonism. This inhibition is mediated by interference with HIV-1 Env and can impact a variety of viral clades. These observations highlight the importance of P2X1 antagonists as potential novel therapeutics that could serve to block a variety of different viral clades with additional benefits for their anti-inflammatory properties.",

    "abstract": "Reorienting attention to unexpected events is essential in daily life. fMRI studies have revealed the involvement of the ventral attention network (VAN), including the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), in such process. In this MEG study with 34 participants (17 women) we used a bimodal (visual/auditory) attention task to determine the neuronal dynamics associated with suppression of the activity of the VAN during top-down attention and its recruitment when information from the unattended sensory modality is involuntarily integrated. We observed an anticipatory power increase of alpha/beta (12-20 Hz) oscillations in the VAN following a cue indicating the modality to attend. Stronger VAN power increases predicted better task performance, suggesting that the VAN suppression prevents shifting attention to distractors. Moreover, the TPJ was synchronized with the frontal eye field in that frequency band, suggesting that the dorsal attention network (DAN) might participate in such suppression. Furthermore, we found a 12-20 Hz power decrease, in both the VAN and DAN, when information of both sensory modalities was congruent, suggesting an involvement of these networks for attention capture. Our results show that effective multimodal attentional reorientation includes the modulation of the VAN and DAN through upper-alpha/beta oscillations. Altogether these results indicate that the suppressing role of alpha/beta oscillations might operate beyond sensory regions.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTReorienting attention to unexpected events from multiple sensory sources is essential in daily life. We explored the dynamics of the ventral attention network (VAN), a set of brain regions related to attentional reorienting, when relevant information was anticipated (i.e. during top-down attention) and when unexpected congruent information from another sensory modality was presented (involuntary attentional capture). We report that activity in the alpha/beta range (12-20 Hz) within the VAN indexed both top-down and attentional capture processes. Also, the VAN was synchronized with the dorsal attention network in this frequency band, suggesting an integrated role of both networks for attentional regulation. Our results shed light on the neurophysiological mechanisms that the brain carry out for reorienting attention to relevant environmental stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Small-molecule flux in tissue-microdomains is essential for organ function, but knowledge of this process is scant due to the lack of suitable methods. We developed two independent techniques that allow the quantification of advection (flow) and diffusion in individual bile canaliculi and in interlobular bile ducts of intact livers in living mice, namely Fluorescence Loss After Photoactivation (FLAP) and Intravital Arbitrary Region Image Correlation Spectroscopy (IVARICS). The results challenge the prevailing \u2018mechano-osmotic\u2019 theory of canalicular bile flow. After active transport across hepatocyte membranes bile acids are transported in the canaliculi primarily by diffusion. Only in the interlobular ducts, diffusion is augmented by regulatable advection. Photoactivation of fluorescein bis-(5-carboxymethoxy-2-nitrobenzyl)-ether (CMNB-caged fluorescein) in entire lobules demonstrated the establishment of diffusive gradients in the bile canalicular network and the sink function of interlobular ducts. In contrast to the bile canalicular network, vectorial transport was detected and quantified in the mesh of interlobular bile ducts. In conclusion, the liver consists of a diffusion dominated canalicular domain, where hepatocytes secrete small molecules and generate a concentration gradient and a flow-augmented ductular domain, where regulated water influx creates unidirectional advection that augments the diffusive flux.One Sentence Summary/Keywords Bile flux proceeds by diffusion in canaliculi, augmented by advection in ducts.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Chill-susceptible insects, like the migratory locust, often die when exposed to low temperatures from an accumulation of tissue damage that is unrelated to freezing (chilling injuries). Chilling injury is consistently associated with ion imbalance across the gut epithelia. It has recently been suggested that this imbalance is at least partly caused by a cold-induced disruption of epithelial barrier function. Here, we aim to test this hypothesis in the migratory locust (L. migratoria). First, chill tolerance was quantified by exposing locusts to -2{degrees}C for various durations and monitored for chill coma recovery time and survival 24h post-cold exposure. Longer exposure times significantly increased recovery time and caused injury and death. Ion-selective microelectrodes were also used to determine the presence of cold-induced ion imbalance. We found a significant increase and decrease of hemolymph K+ and Na+ concentrations over time, respectively. Next, barrier failure along the gut was tested by monitoring the movement of an epithelial barrier marker (FITC-dextran) across the gut epithelia during exposure to -2{degrees}C. We found minimal marker movement across the epithelia in the serosal to mucosal direction, suggesting that locust gut barrier function remains generally conserved during chilling. However, when tested in the mucosal to serosal direction, we saw significant increases of FITC-dextran with chilling. This instead suggests that while cold-induced barrier disruption is present, it is likely unidirectional. It is important to note that these data reveal only the phenomenon itself. The location of this leak as well as the underlying mechanisms remain unclear and require further investigation.\\n\\nSummary statementIn this study, we provide the first evidence for the presence of cold-induced paracellular leak along the gut of the migratory locust, and that this leak is strongest in the mucosal to serosal direction.",

For some taxa, this is relatively straightforward; however, for plants, the presence of cell walls and a diverse set of specialized metabolites such as lignin, phenolics, alkaloids, terpenes, and flavonoids present significant challenges in the generation of DNA suitable for production of long reads. Success in generating long read lengths and genome assemblies of plants has been reported using diverse DNA isolation methods, some of which were tailored to the target species and/or required extensive labor. To avoid the need to optimize DNA isolation for each species, we developed a taxa-independent DNA isolation method that is relatively simple and efficient. This method expands on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies high molecular weight genomic DNA protocol from plant leaves and utilizes a conventional cetyl trimethylammonium bromide extraction followed by removal of impurities and short DNA fragments using commercially available kits that yielded robust N50 read lengths and yield on Oxford Nanopore Technologies flow cells.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, with metabolic dysfunction seen years before the emergence of clinical symptoms. Increasing evidence suggests a role for primary and secondary bile acids, the end-product of cholesterol metabolism, influencing pathophysiology in AD. In this study, we analyzed transcriptomes from 2114 post-mortem brain samples from three independent cohorts and identified that the genes involved in alternative bile acid synthesis pathway was expressed in brain compared to the classical pathway. These results were supported by targeted metabolomic analysis of primary and secondary bile acids measured from post-mortem brain samples of 111 individuals. We reconstructed brain region-specific metabolic networks using data from three independent cohorts to assess the role of bile acid metabolism in AD pathophysiology. Our metabolic network analysis suggested that taurine transport, bile acid synthesis and cholesterol metabolism differed in AD and cognitively normal individuals. Using the brain transcriptional regulatory network, we identified putative transcription factors regulating these metabolic genes and influencing altered metabolism in AD. Intriguingly, we find bile acids from the brain metabolomics whose synthesis cannot be explained by enzymes we find in the brain, suggesting they may originate from an external source such as the gut microbiome. These findings motivate further research into bile acid metabolism and transport in AD to elucidate their possible connection to cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveInterferential stimulation (IFS) has generated considerable interest recently because of its potential to achieve focal electric fields in deep brain areas with transcranial currents. Conventionally, IFS applies sinusoidal currents through two electrode pairs with close-by frequencies. Here we propose to use an array of electrodes instead of just two electrode pairs; and to use algorithmic optimization to identify the currents required at each electrode to target a desired location in the brain.\n\nApproachWe formulate rigorous optimization criteria for IFS to achieve either maximal modulation-depth or maximally focal stimulation. We find the solution for optimal modulation-depth analytically and maximize for focal stimulation numerically.\n\nMain resultsMaximal modulation is achieved when IFS equals conventional high-definition multi-electrode transcranial electrical stimulation (HD-TES) with a modulated current source. This optimal solution can be found directly from a current-flow model, i.e. the \"lead field\" without the need for algorithmic optimization. Once currents are optimized numerically to achieve optimal focal stimulation, we find that IFS can indeed be more focal than conventional HD-TES, both at the cortical surface and deep in the brain. Generally, however, stimulation intensity of IFS is weak and the locus of highest intensity does not match the locus of highest modulation.\n\nSignificanceThis proof-of-principle study shows the potential of IFS over HD-TES for focal non-invasive deep brain stimulation. Future work will be needed to improve on intensity of stimulation and convergence of the optimization procedure.",

    "abstract": "Specific cell and tissue form is essential to support many biological functions of living organisms. During development, the creation of different shapes at the cellular and tissue level fundamentally requires the integration of genetic, biochemical and physical inputs.\\n\\nIt is well established that the cortical microtubule network plays a key role in the morphogenesis of the plant cell wall by guiding the organisation of new cell wall material. Moreover, it has been suggested that light or mechanical stresses can orient the microtubules thereby controlling wall architecture and plant cell shape. The cytoskeleton is thus a major determinant of plant cell shape. What is less clear is how cell shape in turn influences cytoskeletal organization.\\n\\nRecent in vitro experiments and numerical simulations predicted that a geometry-based rule is sufficient to explain some of the microtubule organization observed in cells. Due to their high flexural rigidity and persistence length of the order of a few millimeters, MTs are rigid over cellular dimensions and are thus expected to align along their long axis if constrained in specific geometries. This hypothesis remains to be tested in cellulo.\\n\\nHere we present an experimental approach to explore the relative contribution of geometry to the final organization of actin and microtubule cytoskeletons in single plant cells. We show that, in cells constrained in rectangular shapes, the cytoskeleton align along the long axis of the cells. By studying actin and microtubules in cells with the same system we show that while actin organisation requires microtubules to be present to align the converse is not the case. A model of self organizing microtubules in 3D predicts that severing of microtubules is an important parameter controlling the anisotropy of the microtubule network. We experimentally confirmed the model predictions by analysing the response to shape change in plant cells with altered microtubule severing dynamics. This work is a first step towards assessing quantitatively how cell geometry contributes to the control of cytoskeletal organization in living plant cells.",

    "abstract": "NMR spectroscopy provides a powerful approach for the characterisation of chemical exchange and molecular interactions by analysis of series of experiments acquired over the course of a titration measurement. The appearance of NMR resonances undergoing chemical exchange depends on the frequency difference relative to the rate of exchange, and in the case of one-dimensional experiments chemical exchange regimes are well established and well known. However, two-dimensional experiments present additional complexity, as at least one additional frequency difference must be considered. Here we provide a systematic classification of chemical exchange regimes in two-dimensional NMR spectra. We highlight important differences between exchange in HSQC and HMQC experiments, that on a practical level result in more severe exchange broadening in HMQC spectra, but show that complementary alternatives to the HMQC are available in the form of HZQC and HDQC experiments. We present the longitudinal relaxation optimised SOFAST-H(Z/D)QC experiment for the simultaneous acquisition of sensitivity-enhanced HZQC and HDQC spectra, and the longitudinal and transverse relaxation optimised BEST-ZQ-TROSY for analysis of large molecular weight systems. We describe the application of these experiments to the characterisation of the interaction between the Hsp90 N-terminal domain and a small molecule ligand, and show that the independent analysis of HSQC, HMQC, HZQC and HDQC experiments provides improved confidence in the fitted dissociation constant and dissociation rate. Joint analysis of such data may provide improved sensitivity to detect and analyse more complex multi-state interaction mechanisms such as induced fit or conformational selection.",

    "abstract": "It has been well documented that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) responds to cellular stresses through the unfolded protein response (UPR), but it is unknown how the Golgi responds to similar stresses. In this study, we treated HeLa cells with ER stress inducers, thapsigargin (TG), tunicamycin (Tu) and Dithiothreitol (DTT), and found that only TG treatment caused Golgi fragmentation. TG induced Golgi fragmentation at a low dose and short time when UPR was undetectable, demonstrating that Golgi fragmentation occurs independently of ER stress. Further experiments demonstrated that TG induces Golgi fragmentation through elevated intracellular Ca2+ and protein kinase C (PKC) activity, which phosphorylates the Golgi stacking protein GRASP55. Significantly, activation of PKC with other activating or inflammatory agents, including Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and histamine, modulates the Golgi structure in a similar fashion. Hence, our study revealed a novel mechanism through which increased cytosolic Ca2+ modulates Golgi structure and function.",

    "abstract": "During embryonic development, cells must navigate through diverse three-dimensional environments robustly and reproducibly. The zebrafish posterior lateral line primordium (PLLp), a group of approximately 120 cells which migrates from the otic vesicle to the tip of the tail, spearheading the development of the lateral line sensory system, is an excellent model to study such collective migration in an in vivo context. This system migrates in a channel formed by the underlying horizontal myoseptum and somites, and the overlying skin. While cells in the leading part of the PLLp are flat and have a more mesenchymal morphology, cells in the trailing part progressively reorganize to form epithelial rosettes, called protoneuromasts. These epithelial cells extend basal cryptic lamellipodia in the direction of migration in response to both chemokine and FGF signals. In this study, we show that, in addition to these cryptic lamellipodia, the core epithelial cells are in fact surrounded by a population of motile cells which extend actin-rich migratory processes apposed to the overlying skin. These thin cells wrap around the protoneuromasts, forming a continuous sheath of cells around the apical and lateral surface of the PLLp. The processes extended by these cells are highly polarized in the direction of migration and this directionality, like that of the basal lamellipodia, is dependent on FGF signaling. Consistent with interactions of sheath cells with the overlying skin contributing to migration, removal of the skin stalls migration. However, this is accompanied by some surprising changes. There is a profound change in the morphology of the sheath cells, with directional superficial lamellipodia being replaced with the appearance of undirected blebs or ruffles. Furthermore, removal of the skin not only affects underlying lamellipodia, it simultaneously alters the morphology and behavior of the deeper basal cryptic lamellipodia, even though these cells do not directly contact the skin. Directional actin-rich protrusions on both the apical and basal surface and migration are completely and simultaneously restored upon regrowth of the skin over the PLLp. We suggest that this system utilizes a circumferential sheath of motile cells to allow the internal epithelial cells to migrate collectively in the confined space of the horizontal myopseptum and that elastic confinement provided by the overlying skin is essential for effective collective migratory behavior of primordium cells.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila telomeres have been maintained by three families of active transposable elements (TEs), HeT-A, TAHRE and TART, collectively referred to as HTTs, for tens of millions of years, which contrasts with an unusually high degree of HTT interspecific variation. While the impacts of conflict and domestication are often invoked to explain HTT variation, the telomeres are unstable structures such that neutral mutational processes and evolutionary tradeoffs may also drive HTT evolution. We leveraged population genomic data to analyze nearly 10,000 HTT insertions in 85 D. melanogaster genomes and compared their variation to other more typical TE families. We observe that occasional large-scale copy number expansions of both HTTs and other TE families occur, highlighting that the HTTs are, like their feral cousins, typically repressed but primed to take over given the opportunity. However, large expansions of HTTs are not caused by the runaway activity of any particular HTT subfamilies or even associated with telomere-specific TE activity, as might be expected if HTTs are in strong genetic conflict with their hosts. Rather than conflict, we suggest instead that distinctive aspects of HTT copy number variation and sequence diversity largely reflect telomere instability, with HTT insertions being lost at much higher rates than other TEs elsewhere in the genome. We extend previous observations that telomere deletions occur at a high rate, and surprisingly discover that more than a third do not appear to have been healed with an HTT insertion. We also report that some HTT families may be preferentially activated by the erosion of whole telomeres, implying the existence of HTT-specific host control mechanisms. We further suggest that the persistent telomere localization of HTTs may reflect a highly successful evolutionary strategy that trades away a stable insertion site in order to have reduced impact on the host genome. We propose that HTT evolution is driven by multiple processes with niche specialization and telomere instability being previously underappreciated and likely predominant.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning models have shown great promise in predicting genome-wide regulatory effects from DNA sequence, but their informativeness for human complex diseases and traits is not fully understood. Here, we evaluate the disease informativeness of allelic-effect annotations (absolute value of the predicted difference between reference and variant alleles) constructed using two previously trained deep learning models, DeepSEA and Basenji. We apply stratified LD score regression (S-LDSC) to 41 independent diseases and complex traits (average N=320K) to evaluate each annotations informativeness for disease heritability conditional on a broad set of coding, conserved, regulatory and LD-related annotations from the baseline-LD model and other sources; as a secondary metric, we also evaluate the accuracy of models that incorporate deep learning annotations in predicting disease-associated or fine-mapped SNPs. We aggregated annotations across all tissues (resp. blood cell types or brain tissues) in meta-analyses across all 41 traits (resp. 11 blood-related traits or 8 brain-related traits). These allelic-effect annotations were highly enriched for disease heritability, but produced only limited conditionally significant results - only Basenji-H3K4me3 in meta-analyses across all 41 traits and brain-specific Basenji-H3K4me3 in meta-analyses across 8 brain-related traits. We conclude that deep learning models are yet to achieve their full potential to provide considerable amount of unique information for complex disease, and that the informativeness of deep learning models for disease beyond established functional annotations cannot be inferred from metrics based on their accuracy in predicting regulatory annotations.",

Symbiodinium is a basal symbiodiniacean lineage and includes symbiotic and free-living taxa. However, the molecular mechanisms underpinning these distinct lifestyles remain little known. Here, we present high-quality de novo genome assemblies for the symbiotic Symbiodinium tridacnidorum CCMP2592 (genome size 1.3 Gbp) and the free-living Symbiodinium natans CCMP2548 (genome size 0.74 Gbp). These genomes display extensive sequence divergence, sharing only ~1.5% conserved regions ([&ge;]90% identity). We predicted 45,474 and 35,270 genes for S. tridacnidorum and S. natans, respectively; of the 58,541 homologous gene families, 28.5% are common to both genomes. We recovered a greater extent of gene duplication and higher abundance of repeats, transposable elements and pseudogenes in the genome of S. tridacnidorum than in that of S. natans. These findings demonstrate that genome structural rearrangements are pertinent to distinct lifestyles in Symbiodinium, and may contribute to the vast genetic diversity within the genus, and more broadly in Symbiodiniaceae. Moreover, the results from our whole-genome comparisons against a free-living outgroup support the notion that the symbiotic lifestyle is a derived trait in, and that the free-living lifestyle is ancestral to, Symbiodinium.",

    "abstract": "Down syndrome is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability and occurs due to the trisomy of human chromosome 21. Adolescent and adult brains from humans with Down syndrome exhibit various neurological phenotypes including a reduction in the size of the corpus callosum, hippocampal commissure and anterior commissure. However, it is unclear when and how these interhemispheric connectivity defects arise. Using the Ts65Dn mouse model of Down syndrome, we examined interhemispheric connectivity in postnatal day 0 (P0) Ts65Dn mouse brains. We find that there is no change in the volume of the corpus callosum or anterior commissure in P0 Ts65Dn mice. However, the volume of the hippocampal commissure is significantly reduced in P0 Ts65Dn mice, and this may contribute to the impaired learning and memory phenotype of this disorder. Interhemispheric connectivity defects that arise during development may be due to disrupted axon growth. In line with this, we find that developing hippocampal neurons display reduced axon length in vitro, as compared to neurons from their euploid littermates. This study is the first to report the presence of defective interhemispheric connectivity at the time of birth in Ts65Dn mice, providing evidence that early therapeutic intervention may be an effective time window for the treatment of Down syndrome.",

    "abstract": "The explore-exploit dilemma describes the trade off that occurs any time we must choose between exploring unknown options and exploiting options we know well. Implicit in this trade off is how we value future rewards -- exploiting is usually better in the short term, but in the longer term the benefits of exploration can be huge. Thus, in theory there should be a tight connection between how much people value future rewards, i.e. how much they discount future rewards relative to immediate rewards, and how likely they are to explore, with less  temporal discounting associated with more exploration. By measuring individual differences in temporal discounting and correlating them with explore-exploit behavior, we tested whether this theoretical prediction holds in practice. We used the 27-item Delay-Discounting Questionnaire to estimate temporal discounting and the Horizon Task to quantify two strategies of explore-exploit behavior: directed exploration, where information drives exploration by choice, and random exploration, where behavioral variability drives exploration by chance. We find a clear correlation between temporal discounting and directed exploration, with more temporal discounting leading to less directed exploration. Conversely, we find no relationship between temporal discounting and random exploration. Unexpectedly, we find that the relationship with directed exploration appears to be driven by a correlation between temporal discounting and uncertainty seeking at short time horizons, rather than information seeking at long horizons. Taken together our results suggest a nuanced relationship between temporal discounting and explore-exploit behavior that may be mediated by multiple factors.",

    "abstract": "Multiple organ dysfunction induced by sepsis often involves kidney injury. Extracellular histones released in response to damage-associated molecular patterns are known to facilitate sepsis-induced organ dysfunction. Recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rhTM) and its lectin-like domain (D1) exert anti-inflammatory effects and neutralize damage-associated molecular patterns. However, the effects of rhTM and D1 on extracellular histone H3 levels and kidney injury remain poorly understood. Our purpose was to investigate the association between extracellular histone H3 levels and kidney injury, and to clarify the effects of rhTM and D1 on extracellular histone H3 levels, kidney injury, and survival in sepsis-induced rats. Rats in whom sepsis was induced via cecal ligation and puncture were used in this study. Histone H3 levels, histopathology of the kidneys, and the survival rate of rats at 24 h after cecal ligation and puncture were investigated. Histone H3 levels increased over time following cecal ligation and puncture. Histopathological analyses indicated that the distribution of degeneration foci among tubular epithelial cells of the kidney and levels of histone H3 increased simultaneously. Administration of rhTM and D1 significantly reduced histone H3 levels compared with that in the vehicle-treated group and improved kidney injury. The survival rates of rats in rhTM- and D1-treated groups were significantly higher than that in the vehicle-treated group. The results of this study indicated that rhTM and its D1 similarly reduce elevated histone H3 levels, thereby reducing acute kidney injury. Our findings also proposed that rhTM and D1 show potential as new treatment strategies for sepsis combined with acute kidney injury.",

These T2Rs can be activated by several bacterial products and regulate innate immune responses in several cell types. Expression of T2Rs has been demonstrated in immune cells like neutrophils; however, the molecular details of their signaling are unknown. We examined mechanisms of T2R signaling in primary human monocyte-derived unprimed (M0) macrophages (M{Phi}s) using live cell imaging techniques. Known bitter compounds and bacterial T2R agonists activated low-level calcium signals through a pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive, phospholipase C-dependent, and inositol trisphosphate receptor-dependent calcium release pathway. These calcium signals activated low-level nitric oxide (NO) production via endothelial and neuronal NO synthase (NOS) isoforms. NO production increased cellular cGMP and enhanced acute phagocytosis [~]3-fold over 30-60 min via protein kinase G. In parallel with calcium elevation, T2R activation lowered cAMP, also through a PTX-sensitive pathway. The cAMP decrease also contributed to enhanced phagocytosis. Moreover, a co-culture model with airway epithelial cells demonstrated that NO produced by epithelial cells can also acutely enhance M{Phi} phagocytosis. Together, these data define M{Phi} T2R signal transduction and support an immune recognition role for T2Rs in M{Phi} cell physiology.",

Regeneration is initiated by rapid accumulation of auxin near the injury site but the source of this auxin is unknown. Here, we show that auxin accumulation arises from the activity of multiple auxin biosynthetic sources that are newly specified near the cut site and that their continuous activity is required for the regeneration process. Auxin synthesis is highly localized and PIN-mediate transport is dispensable for auxin accumulation and tip regeneration. Roots lacking the activity of the regeneration competence factor ERF115, or that are dissected at a zone of low-regeneration potential, fail to activate local auxin sources. Remarkably, restoring auxin supply is sufficient to confer regeneration capacity to these recalcitrant tissues. We suggest that regeneration competence relies on the ability to specify new local auxin sources in a precise spatio-temporal pattern.",

Here we assayed the larvicidal activity of six common HIPVs from three different biochemical pathways and tested the hypothesis that the larvicidal activity of HIPVs is related to the host specialization of the insect pest. We first assessed {beta}-caryophyllene, linalool, z-3-hexenyl acetate, z-3-hexenol, e-2-hexenol, and indole against the beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua), and found that indole was 7-fold more toxic compared to the other volatiles when incorporated into diet. Then, we tested the larvicidal activity of indole against six common, destructive pest caterpillars with varying host ranges. Consistent with our hypothesis, indole toxicity varied with caterpillar host range: indole toxicity was seven-fold higher in more specialized insect species relative to generalist insect species. That said, the LC50 of indole was comparable to other reported anti-herbivore agents even against the generalist caterpillars. Yet, indole in headspace had neither larvicidal nor ovicidal activity on any caterpillar species tested. These results support a key ecological precept regarding tradeoffs between host specialization and chemical detoxification, and also indicate that indole functions as a direct defense against herbivores that could be potentially useful in integrated pest management strategies.\\n\\nKey messageO_LIWe measured the direct toxicity of six common HIPVs against the beet armyworm.\\nC_LIO_LIIndole was the most toxic HIPV against the beet armyworm.\\nC_LIO_LIWe determined the toxicity of indole against six different pest caterpillar species.\\nC_LIO_LIToxicity of indole was associated with the host preference of the insect species.\\nC_LIO_LIIndole exposure in headspace had no effect on egg hatching or caterpillar survival.\\nC_LIO_LIIndole has the potential to be developed as an insecticide against crop pests.\\nC_LI\\n\\nAuthor Contribution StatementCJF and AKM designed research.

    "abstract": "BackgroundDuring the last decade, the analysis of ancient DNA (aDNA) sequence has become a powerful tool for the study of past human populations. However, the degraded nature of aDNA means that aDNA molecules are short and frequently mutated by post-mortem chemical modifications. These features decrease read mapping accuracy and increase reference bias, in which reads containing non-reference alleles are less likely to be mapped than those containing reference alleles. Recently, alternative approaches for read mapping and genetic variation analysis have been developed that replace the linear reference by a variation graph which includes known alternative variants at each genetic locus. Here, we evaluate the use of variation graph software vg to avoid reference bias for ancient DNA and compare our approach to existing methods.\n\nResultsWe used vg to align simulated and real aDNA samples to a variation graph containing 1000 Genome Project variants, and compared these with the same data aligned with bwa to the human linear reference genome. We show that use of vg leads to a balanced allelic representation at polymorphic sites, effectively removing reference bias, and more sensitive variant detection in comparison with bwa, especially for insertions and deletions (indels). Alternative approaches that use relaxed bwa parameter settings or filter bwa alignments can also reduce bias, but can have lower sensitivity than vg, particularly for indels.\n\nConclusionsOur findings demonstrate that aligning aDNA sequences to variation graphs effectively mitigates the impact of reference bias when analysing aDNA, while retaining mapping sensitivity and allowing detection of variation, in particular indel variation, that was previously missed.",

    "abstract": "MDM2 is an oncogene and critical negative regulator of tumor suppressor p53. Genotoxic stress causes alternative splicing of MDM2 transcripts, which leads to alterations in p53 activity and contributes to tumorigenesis. MDM2-ALT1 is one of transcripts predominantly produced in response to genotoxic stress and is comprised of terminal coding exons 3 and 12. Previously, we found that SRSF1 induces MDM2-ALT1 by promoting MDM2 exon 11 skipping. Here we report that splicing regulator SRSF2 antagonizes the regulation of SRSF1 by facilitating the inclusion of exon 11 through binding at two conserved exonic splicing enhancers. Overexpression of SRSF2 reduced the generation of MDM2-ALT1 in genotoxic stress condition, whereas knockdown induces the expression of MDM2-ALT1 in absence of genotoxic stress. Consistently, blocking the exon 11 SRSF2 binding sites using oligonucleotides promotes MDM2-ALT1. The regulation of MDM2 splicing by SRSF2 is also conserved in mouse as mutation of one SRSF2 binding site in Mdm2 exon 11, using CRISPR-Cas9, increases the expression MDM2-ALT1 homolog Mdm2-MS2 and proliferation of NIH 3T3 cells. Taken together, these findings underscore the relevance of MDM2 alternative splicing in cancer and suggest that p53 levels can be modulated by artificially regulating MDM2 splicing.",

    "abstract": "Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor with high fatality rate. Recent large-scale studies utilizing genome-wide technologies have sub-grouped medulloblastomas into four major subgroups: wingless (WNT), sonic hedgehog (SHH), group 3, and group 4. However, there has yet to be a global analysis of long non-coding RNAs, a crucial part of the regulatory transcriptome, in medulloblastoma. Here, we performed bioinformatic analysis of RNA-seq data from 175 medulloblastoma patients. Differential lncRNA expression sub-grouped medulloblastomas into the four main molecular subgroups. Some of these lncRNAs were subgroup-specific, with a random forest-based machine-learning algorithm identifying an 11-lncRNA diagnostic signature. We also validated the diagnostic signature in patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. We further identified a 17-lncRNA prognostic model using LASSO based penalized Cox PH model (Score HR= 13.6301, 95% CI= 8.857-20.98, logrank p-value=< 2e-16). Our analysis represents the first global lncRNA analysis in medulloblastoma. Our results identify putative candidate lncRNAs that could be evaluated for their functional role in medulloblastoma genesis and progression or as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "Soybean is a crop of major economic importance with low rates of genetic gains for grain yield compared to other field crops. A deeper understanding of the genetic architecture of yield components may enable better ways to tackle the breeding challenges. Key yield components include the total number of pods, nodes and the ratio pods per node. We evaluated the SoyNAM population, containing approximately 5600 lines from 40 biparental families that share a common parent, in 6 environments distributed across 3 years. The study indicates that the yield components under evaluation have low heritability, a reasonable amount of epistatic control, and partially oligogenic architecture: 18 quantitative trait loci were identified across the three yield components using multi-approach signal detection. Genetic correlation between yield and yield components was highly variable from family-to-family, ranging from -0.2 to 0.5. The genotype-by-environment correlation of yield components ranged from -0.1 to 0.4 within families. The number of pods can be utilized for indirect selection of yield. The selection of soybean for enhanced yield components can be successfully performed via genomic prediction, but the challenging data collections necessary to recalibrate models over time makes the introgression of QTLs a potentially more feasible breeding strategy. The genomic prediction of yield components was relatively accurate across families, but less accurate predictions were obtained from within-family predictions and predicting families not observed included in the calibration set.",

One reason for this is that they are mostly genetically intractable. As a consequence, it is not possible to engineer strains expressing fluorescent proteins and therefore fluorescence light microscopy - a key tool in host-pathogen cell biology studies - is difficult. Strain diversity limits the universality of antibody-based immunofluorescence approaches. Here, we have developed a universal labelling protocol for intracellular bacteria based on a clickable methionine analog.

    "abstract": "Voluntary actions are preceded by a Readiness Potential (RP), a slow EEG component generated in medial frontal cortical areas. The RP is classically thought to be specific to internally-driven decisions to act, and to reflect post-decision motor preparation. Recent work suggests instead that it may reflect noise or conflict during the decision itself, with internally-driven decisions tending to be more random, more conflictual and thus more uncertain than externally-driven actions. To contrast accounts based on endogenicity with accounts based on uncertainty, we recorded EEG in a task where participants decided to act or withhold action to accept or reject visually-presented gambles, and used multivariate methods to extract an RP-like component.. We found no difference in amplitude of this component between actions driven by strong versus weak evidence, suggesting that the RP may not reflect uncertainty. In contrast, the same RP-like component showed higher amplitudes prior to actions performed without any external evidence (guesses) than for actions performed in response to equivocal, conflicting evidence. This supports the view that the RP reflects the internal source of action, rather than decision uncertainty.\n\nSignificance StatementThe EEG Readiness Potential (RP) seen prior to self-initiated actions is often taken as a neural marker of volition (Shibasaki & Hallett, 2006). It has been argued that the RP may instead reflect conflict and uncertainty in the decisions leading up to these actions, raising questions about decades of previous findings. We directly tested these explanations by asking participants to decide whether to act or not in a gambling task, while manipulating both uncertainty and the source of the information (internal or external) guiding the decision. Only the source of information affected the presence of the RP. Therefore, the RP remains a marker of internally-generated voluntary action, not a marker of uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "An animals behavioral and physiological response to stressors includes changes to its responses to stimuli. How such changes occur is not well understood. Here we describe a Caenorhabditis elegans quiescent behavior, post-response quiescence (PRQ), which is modulated by the C. elegans response to cellular stressors. Following an aversive mechanical or blue light stimulus, worms respond first by briefly moving, and then become more quiescent for a period lasting tens of seconds. PRQ occurs at low frequency in unstressed animals, but is more frequent in animals that have experienced cellular stress due to ultraviolet light exposure as well as in animals following overexpression of epidermal growth factor (EGF). PRQ requires the function of the carboxypeptidase EGL-21 and the calcium-activated protein for secretion (CAPS) UNC-31, suggesting it has a neuropeptidergic mechanism. Although PRQ requires the sleep-promoting neurons RIS and ALA, it is not accompanied by decreased arousability, and does not appear to be homeostatically regulated, suggesting that it is not a sleep state. PRQ represents a simple, tractable model for studying how neuromodulatory states like stress alter behavioral responses to stimuli.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveHigh-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a promising biomarker for the epileptogenic zone. However, no physiological definition of an HFO has been established, so detection relies on the empirical definition of an HFO derived from visual observation. This can bias estimates of HFO features such as amplitude and duration, thereby hindering their utility as biomarkers. Therefore, we set out to develop an algorithm that detects high frequency events in the intracranial EEG that stand out from the background and does not require assumptions about event amplitude or morphology.\\n\\nMethodWe propose the anomaly detection algorithm (ADA), which integrates several unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify segments of data that are distinct from the background. We apply ADA and a standard HFO detector using a root-mean-square amplitude threshold to intracranial EEG from 11 patients undergoing evaluation for epilepsy surgery. The rate, amplitude, and duration of the detected events and the percent overlap between the two detectors are compared.\\n\\nResultIn the seizure onset zone (SOZ), ADA detected a subset of conventional HFOs. In non-SOZ channels, ADA detected at least twice as many events as the standard approach, including some conventional HFOs; however, ADA also identified many low and intermediate amplitude events missed by the standard amplitude-based method. The rate of ADA events was similar across all channels; however, the amplitude of ADA events was significantly higher in SOZ channels, and the threshold between SOZ and non-SOZ channels was relatively consistent across patients.\\n\\nSignificanceADA does not require human supervision, parameter optimization, or prior assumptions about event shape, amplitude, or duration. It provides an unbiased estimate of HFO features, and our results suggest that amplitude may differentiate SOZ and non-SOZ channels. Further studies will examine the utility of HFO amplitude as a biomarker for epilepsy surgical outcome.",

We present a novel approach using the word-by-word technique from improvisational theatre, in which two speakers jointly produce one sentence. This paradigm allows the assessment of behavioural aspects, such as turn-times, and electrophysiological responses, such as event-related-potentials (ERPs). Twenty-five participants constructed a cued but spontaneous four-word German sentence together with a confederate, taking turns for each word of the sentence. In 30% of the trials, an unexpected gender-marked article was uttered by the confederate. To complete the sentence in a meaningful way, the participant had to detect the violation, (possibly) inhibit a prepared response, and retrieve and utter a new fitting response. We found significant increases in response times after unexpected words and - despite allowing unscripted language production and naturally varying speech material - successfully detected significant N400 and P600 ERP effects for the unexpected word. The N400 EEG activity further significantly predicted the response time of the subsequent turn. Our results show that combining behavioural and neuroscientific measures of verbal interactions while retaining sufficient experimental control is possible, and that this combination provides promising insights into the mechanisms of spontaneous spoken dialogue.",

    "abstract": "Organisms must learn novel strategies to adapt to changing environments. Synchrony, which enhances neuronal communication, might create dynamic brain states, facilitating such adaptation. Although synchronization is common in neural systems, its functional significance remains controversial. We studied the role of gamma-frequency (~40 Hz) synchronization, promoted by parvalbumin interneurons, in mice learning multiple new cue-reward associations. Voltage imaging revealed cell type-specific increases of interhemispheric gamma synchrony within prefrontal parvalbumin interneurons, when mice received feedback that previously-learned associations were no longer valid. Disrupting this synchronization by delivering out-of-phase optogenetic stimulation caused mice to perseverate on outdated associations, an effect not reproduced by stimulating in-phase or out-of-phase at other frequencies. Gamma synchrony was specifically required when new associations utilized familiar cues that were previously irrelevant to behavioral outcomes, not when associations involved novel cues, or for reversing previously learned associations. Thus, gamma synchrony is indispensable for reappraising the behavioral salience of external cues.",

In addition, at T00 and T12, we assessed lower-limb muscle volume using MRI, and cross-sectional area (CSA) and radiological density using CT.\\n\\nResultsThigh muscle volume increased (15%) in TM, which was paralleled by increased quadriceps CSA (15%) and radiological density (6%). In TW, the corresponding parameters decreased by -5% (muscle volume) and -4% (CSA), while density remained unaltered. The TM increased strength over the assessment period, while the TW generally maintained or slightly increased in strength. Baseline muscle volume correlated highly with strength (R>0.75), yet the relative change in muscle volume and strength correlated only moderately (R=0.65 in TW and R=0.32 in TM). The absolute levels of muscle volume and knee extension strength after the intervention still favored the TW.\\n\\nConclusionCross-sex hormone treatment markedly affects muscle strength, size and composition in transgender individuals. Despite the robust increases in muscle mass and strength in TM, the TW were still stronger and had more muscle mass following 12 months of treatment.

We used a green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagging strategy to identify the low expression of Bik1 (polyketide synthase) as the bottleneck step in the pathway, and a promoter exchange strategy to increase expression of Bik1 and bikaverin yield. To further increase product yield, we used an enzyme-fusion strategy to couple the monooxygenase (Bik2) and methyltransferase (Bik3) to efficiently channel intermediates between modifying enzymes, leading to a dramatic improvement of Bikaverin yield of nearly 60-fold.

    "abstract": "Robust organismal development relies on temporal coordination of disparate physiological processes. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the timely transition from juvenile to adult is controlled by the heterochronic pathway, a regulatory cascade of conserved proteins and small RNAs. The heterochronic pathway culminates in accumulation of the transcription factor LIN-29, which triggers coordinated execution of juvenile-to-adult (J/A) transition events. Here, we reveal that two LIN-29 isoforms fulfill distinct functions during the J/A transition. We show that the functional differences between the isoforms do not stem from differences in their sequences, but from their distinct spatiotemporal expression, and we propose that distinct LIN-29 dose sensitivities of the individual J/A transition events help to ensure their temporal ordering. We demonstrate that unique lin-29 isoform expression patterns are generated by the RNA-binding protein LIN-41 for lin-29a, and the transcription factor HBL-1 for lin-29b. By regulating both HBL-1 and LIN-41, the RNA-binding protein LIN-28 coordinates LIN-29 isoform activity. Thus, our findings reveal that a coordinated transition from juvenile to adult involves branching of a linear pathway to achieve timely control of multiple events.",

    "abstract": "The diversity of immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires is a focal point of immunological studies. Rhesus macaques are key for modeling human immune responses, placing critical importance on the accurate annotation and quantification of their Ig and TCR repertoires. However, due to incomplete reference resources, the coverage and accuracy of the traditional targeted amplification strategies for profiling rhesus Ig and TCR repertoires are largely unknown. Here, using long read sequencing, we sequenced four Indian-origin rhesus macaque tissues and obtained high quality, full-length sequences for over 6,000 unique Ig and TCR transcripts, without the need for sequence assembly. We constructed the first complete reference set for the constant regions of all known isotypes and chain types of rhesus Ig and TCR repertoires. We show that sequence diversity exists across the entire variable regions of rhesus Ig and TCR transcripts. Consequently, existing strategies using targeted amplification of rearranged variable regions comprised of V(D)J gene segments miss a significant fraction (27% to 53% and 42% to 49%) of rhesus Ig/TCR diversity. To overcome these limitations, we designed new rhesus-specific assays that remove the need for primers conventionally targeting variable regions and allow single cell-level Ig and TCR repertoire analysis. Our improved approach will enable future studies to fully capture rhesus Ig and TCR repertoire diversity and is applicable for improving annotations in any model organism.",

    "abstract": "Cachexia is an immune-metabolic disease of progressive muscle wasting that impairs patient survival and quality of life across a range of chronic diseases. T. gondii is a protozoan parasite that causes lifelong infection in many warm-blooded organisms, including humans and mice. Here we show that mice infected with T. gondii develop robust, sustained cachexia and perivascular fibrosis in metabolic tissues. Consistent with an emerging role for the IL-1 axis in disease tolerance, we show that mice deficient in the Type 1 IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) have more severe acute muscle wasting, adipocyte and hepatocyte necrosis, independent of parasite burden. Unexpectedly, IL-1R-/- mice rapidly recover from acute disease, despite sustained parasite infection, and are protected from chronic cachexia as well as perivascular liver and muscle fibrosis. These data are consistent with a model where IL-1R signaling benefits cell survival and tissue integrity over short periods of inflammation, but sustained reliance on IL-1 mediated tolerance programs come at the cost of fibrosis and cachexia.\\n\\nSummaryIL-1R signaling drives a disease tolerance program that protects mice from tissue pathology during acute Toxoplasma gondii infection.

    "abstract": "It is thought that memory is stored in  engrams, a subset of neurons that undergo learning-induced alterations. The role of gene-expression during learning and short-term memory has been studied extensively, but little is known about remote memory that can persist for a lifetime. Using long-term contextual fear memory as a paradigm, an activity-dependent transgenic model for engram-specific labeling, and single-cell transcriptomics we probed the gene-expression landscape underlying remote memory consolidation and recall in the medial prefrontal cortex. Remarkably, we find sustained activity-specific transcriptional alterations in diverse populations of neurons that persist even weeks after fear-learning and are distinct from those previously identified in learning. Out of a vast plasticity-coding space, we uncover select membrane-fusion genes that could play important roles in maintaining remote memory traces. Unexpectedly, astrocytes and microglia also acquire new persistent gene signatures upon recall of remote memory, suggesting that they actively contribute to memory circuits. Our discovery of novel distinct gene-expression programs involved in long term memory adds an important dimension of activity-dependent cellular states to existing brain taxonomy atlases and sheds light on the elusive mechanisms of remote memory storage.",

    "abstract": "Emotional egocentric bias (EEB) occurs when, due to a partial failure in self-other distinction, empathy for anothers emotions is influenced by our own emotional state. Recent studies have demonstrated that this bias is higher in children, adolescents and older adults than in young adults. In the latter, overcoming emotional egocentrism has been associated with significant activity in the right supramarginal gyrus (rSMG), as well as increased connectivity between rSGM and somatosensory and visual cortices. Investigations on the neural correlates of EEB in adolescents and older adults are missing. We filled this gap, by asking female participants from three different age groups (adolescents, young adults and older adults, N=92) to perform a well-validated EEB task (Silani et al., 2013) in an MRI scanner. A multi-level analysis approach of MRI data including functional segregation, effective connectivity and structural analyses was adopted. Results revealed higher EEB in older compared to young adults and a comparable EEB in adolescents and young adults. Age-related differences in EEB were associated with differences in task-related rSMG connectivity with somatosensory cortices, especially with S2, which acted as a partial mediator between age and EEB. These findings provide further evidence for the crucial role of the rSMG in self-other distinction in the emotional domain, and suggest that the age-related decline in overcoming EEB is best explained by changes in rSMG connectivity rather than decreased regional activity in that area. This advocates a more systematic investigation of task-related connectivity in studies on aging and life-span development of social-cognitive phenomena.\\n\\nSignificance StatementEmpathy comprises both the ability to identify and share anothers emotional state, and the ability to disentangle ones own from the others emotional state. When self- and other-related emotions are conflicting, empathy might be negatively influenced by egocentric tendencies. This phenomenon is referred to as emotional egocentric bias (EEB), with previous research showing that its extent changes across the life-span. Here, we provide evidence that age-related differences in EEB are mainly associated with age-related changes in rSMG effective connectivity, and in particular that higher EEB in older adults is associated to lower rSMG effective connectivity with somatosensory cortices. These findings suggest the importance, particularly in aging, of intact functional connectivity for optimal socio-cognitive functioning.",

    "abstract": "The amount of short wavelength (UV, violet and blue) light that reaches the retina depends on the transmittance properties of the ocular media, especially the lens, and varies greatly across species in all vertebrate groups studied previously. We measured the lens transmittance in 32 anuran amphibians with different habits, geographic distributions, and phylogenetic positions and used them together with eye size and pupil shape to evaluate the relationship with diel activity pattern, elevation and latitude. We found an unusually high lens UV transmittance in the most basal species, and a range that extends into the visible spectrum for the rest of the sample, with lenses even absorbing violet light in some diurnal species. However, other diurnal frogs had lenses that transmit UV light like the nocturnal species. This unclear pattern in the segregation of ocular media transmittance and diel activity is shared with other vertebrates and is consistent with the absence of significant correlations in our statistical analyses. Although we did not detect a significant phylogenetic effect, closely related species tend to have similar transmittances, irrespective of whether they share the same diel pattern or not, suggesting that ocular media transmittance properties might be related to phylogeny.",

Epidemiological studies have established a link between night shift work and increased cancer risk, suggesting that circadian disruption may interfere with carcinogenesis. We aim to shed light on the effect of chronic jetlag on mammary tumour development. Therefore, we used a mouse model of spontaneous mammary tumorigenesis that we exposed to chronic circadian disruption. We observed that circadian disruption significantly increases cancer cell dissemination and metastasis. It also enhances the stemness and tumour-initiating potential of tumour cells and creates an immunosuppressive shift in the tumour microenvironment.

    "abstract": "The importance of cancer-associated stroma (CAS) for initiation and progression of cancer is well accepted. However, as stromal changes in benign forms of naturally occurring tumours are poorly understood, it remains unclear how CAS from benign and malignant tumours compare. Spontaneous canine mammary tumours are viewed as excellent models of human mammary carcinomas (mCA). We have recently reported highly conserved stromal reprogramming between canine and human mCA based on transcriptome analysis of laser-capture-microdissected FFPE specimen. To identify stromal changes between benign and malignant mammary tumours, we have analysed CAS and matched normal stroma from 13 canine mammary adenomas and compared them to 15 canine mCA. Our analyses revealed distinct stromal reprogramming even in small benign tumours. While similarities in stromal reprogramming exist, the CAS signature clearly distinguished adenomas from mCA, suggesting that it may reliably discriminate between benign and malignant tumours. We identified strongly discriminatory genes and found strong differential enrichment in several hallmark signalling pathways between benign and malignant CAS. The distinction between CAS from adenoma and mCA was further substantiated by differential abundance in cellular composition. Finally, to determine key players in CAS reprograming between adenomas and mCA, a network-based gene screening method identified modules of co-expressing genes with distinct expression profile in benign and malignant CAS, and revealed several hub genes as potential molecular drivers in CAS. Given the relevance of canine CAS as a model for the human disease, our approach identifies potential stromal drivers of tumour malignancy with implications for human mCA.\\n\\nSummary statementRNAsequencing-based analysis of stromal reprogramming between benign and malignant naturally occurring canine mammary tumours identifies potential molecular drivers in cancer-associated stroma that support tumour growth and malignancy.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRotavirus (RV) is the 5th leading cause of death in children <5 years old but the leading cause of diarrhea related deaths in this age group. The mechanism of RV diarrhea involves decreased activity of Na+-dependent solute transporters with increased luminal secretion of Cl- in the absence of significant histologic damage. While our understanding of RV diarrhea has come from studies in animal models and cancer cell lines, the mechanism of the diarrhea and the transport proteins affected in human RV disease remains only partially understood. This understanding is likely to impact drug development therapy for RV diarrhea.\\n\\nMethodsFormalin-fixed paraffin-embedded small intestinal specimens from patients diagnosed with RV diarrhea (confirmed by anti-RV antibodies) were analyzed by immunofluorescence for changes in apical/basolateral ion/nutrient transporters/channels as well as tight junctional and cytoskeletal proteins. Proximal small intestinal enteroids generated from biopsies obtained from healthy human subjects were grown as monolayers, differentiated to resemble villus epithelial cells, and infected with human RV.\\n\\nResultsRV diarrhea was associated with reduced expression and intracellular localization of transport proteins normally found in the brush border membranes, including SGLT1, NHE3, NHE2, the Na+-dependent amino acid transporter SLC6A19, and CFTR. In contrast, basolateral proteins, including Na+/K+-ATPase, NKCC1, and {beta}-catenin, the brush border marker ezrin, as well as the tight junction protein, ZO-1, were expressed and localized normally. RV-induced mislocalization of NHE3, SGLT1, SLC6A19 and CFTR was also seen when human small intestinal enteroids were infected with RV.\\n\\nConclusionsThese data demonstrate a new pathophysiologic mechanism of acute diarrhea in which expression of multiple apical transport proteins are reduced. This acute diarrhea is likely to be caused by an effect on a common apical trafficking pathway, as exemplified by RV diarrhea, and its contribution to other enteric pathogen-induced diarrheal diseases should be determined.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFamilial sitosterolemia is a rare, recessive Mendelian disorder characterized by hyperabsorption and decreased biliary excretion of dietary sterols. Affected individuals typically have complete genetic deficiency - homozygous loss-of-function (LoF) variants -- in the ATP-binding cassette transporter G5 (ABCG5) or G8 (ABCG8) genes, and have substantially elevated plasma sitosterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. The impact of partial genetic deficiency of ABCG5 or ABCG8, as occurs in heterozygous carriers of LoF variants, on LDL-C and risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) has remained uncertain.\\n\\nMethodsWe first recruited nine sitosterolemia families, identified causative LoF variants in ABCG5 or ABCG8, and evaluated the associations of these ABCG5 or ABCG8 LoF variants with plasma phytosterols and lipid levels. We next assessed for LoF variants in ABCG5 or ABCG8 in CAD cases (n=29,361) versus controls (n=357,326). We tested the association of rare LoF variants in ABCG5 or ABCG8 with blood lipids and risk for CAD. Rare LoF variants were defined as protein-truncating variants with minor allele frequency less than 0.1% in ABCG5 or ABCG8.\\n\\nResultsIn sitosterolemia families, seven pedigrees harbored causative LoF variants in ABCG5 and two pedigrees in ABCG8. Homozygous LoF variants in either ABCG5 or ABCG8 led to marked elevations in sitosterol and LDL-C. Of those sitosterolemia families, heterozygous carriers of ABCG5 LoF variants exhibited increased sitosterol and LDL-C levels compared to non-carriers. Within the large-scale CAD case-control cohorts, prevalence of rare LoF variants in ABCG5 and in ABCG8 were approximately 0.1% each. ABCG5 heterozygous LoF variant carriers had significantly elevated LDL-C levels (24.7 mg/dL; 95% confidence interval [CI] 14 to 35; P=1.1x10-6), and were at two-fold increased risk of CAD (odds ratio 2.06, 95% CI 1.27 to 3.35; P=0.004). By contrast, ABCG8 heterozygous LoF carrier status was not associated with increased LDL-C or risk of CAD.\\n\\nConclusionsAlthough familial sitosterolemia is traditionally considered as a recessive disorder, we observed that heterozygous carriers of a LoF variant in ABCG5 had significantly increased sitosterol and LDL-C levels and a two-fold increase in risk of CAD.",

    "abstract": "While prokaryotic promoters controlled by signal-responding regulators typically display a range of input/output ratios when exposed to cognate inducers, virtually no naturally occurring cases are known to have an off state of zero transcription--as ideally needed for synthetic circuits. To overcome this problem we have modelled and implemented simple digitalizer module that completely suppresses the basal level of otherwise strong promoters in such a way that expression in the absence of induction is entirely impeded. The circuit involves the interplay of a translation-inhibitory sRNA with the translational coupling of the gene of interest to a repressor such as LacI. The digitalizer module was validated with the strong inducible promoters Pm (induced by XylS in the presence of benzoate) and PalkB (induced by AlkS/dicyclopropylketone) and shown to perform effectively both in E. coli and the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida. The distinct expression architecture allowed cloning and conditional expression of e.g. colicin E3, one molecule of which per cell suffices to kill the host bacterium. Revertants that escaped ColE3 killing were not found in hosts devoid of insertion sequences, suggesting that mobile elements are a major source of circuit inactivation in vivo.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAnswering the question how conserved patterning systems are across evolutionary lineages requires a broad taxon sampling. Phoronid development has previously been studied using fate mapping and morphogenesis, yet molecular descriptions are missing. Here we report the expression patterns of the evolutionarily conserved anterior (otx, gsc, six3/6, nk2.1), posterior (cdx, bra) and endomesodermal (foxA, gata4/5/6, twist) markers in the phoronid Phoronopsis harmeri.\\n\\nResultsThe transcription factors foxA, gata4/5/6 and cdx show conserved expression in patterning the development and regionalization of the phoronid embryonic gut, with foxA expressed in the presumptive foregut, gata4/5/6 demarcating the midgut and cdx confined to the hindgut. Surprisingly, brachyury, an evolutionary conserved transcription factor often associated with gastrulation movements and patterning of the mouth and hindgut, seems to be unrelated with gastrulation and mouth patterning in phoronids. Furthermore, six3/6, a well-conserved anterior marker, shows a remarkably dynamic expression, demarcating not only the apical organ and the oral ectoderm, but also clusters of cells of the developing midgut and the anterior mesoderm, similar to what has been reported for brachiopods, bryozoans and some deuterostome Bilateria.\\n\\nConclusionsOur comparison of gene expression patterns with other studied Bilateria reveals that the timing of axis determination and cell fate distribution of the phoronid shows highest similarities to rhynchonelliform brachiopods. Despite these similarities, the phoronid P. harmeri shows also particularities in its development, which hint to divergences in the arrangement of gene regulatory networks responsible for germ layer formation and axis specification.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) encoded by DRD2 gene, is located on chromosome 11q22-23. Dopamine plays the central role in motivation, cognition, and reward seeking behaviour. Its dysfunction is implicated in numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders including drug abuse, schizophrenia, ADHD etc. The TaqI A polymorphism is localized 9.8 kb downstream from DRD2 gene in exon 8 of protein kinase gene (ANKK1). It is a SNP demonstrated to cause Glutamate to Lysine substitution at 713 amino acid residue in putative binding domain of ANKK1. Due to the central role of dopamine in reward seeking behavior, DRD2 TaqI A loci is a suitable candidate for investigation of molecular basis of addiction. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the frequency of DRD2 TaqI A polymorphism in Eastern Uttar Pradesh population. 3ml blood samples were collected from 50 individuals randomly selected from Eastern UP. Written informed consent along with profile detail was taken from each subject prior to blood sample collection. DRD2 TaqI A polymorphism analysis was done by PCR-RFLP method. Genomic DNA was extracted from each collected blood samples and amplified using DRD2 Taq1 region specific primers. PCR amplification produced 310bp long amplicon which was digested with Taq I enzyme for polymorphism analysis. In case of A2 allele, Taq1 enzyme cleaved 310bp long fragment into two fragments of 180bp and 130bp. In case of A1 allele, a C to T substitution demolished the restriction site of Taq1, so amplicon of A1 allele remained uncut. In total 50 sample analyzed in present study, A2/A2, A2/A1 and A1/A1 genotype were found in 12, 32 and 06 samples respectively. The genotypic frequencies of mutant homozygous (A1/A1) is 0.12, heterozygous (A2/A1) is 0.64 and normal homozygous (A2/A2) is 0.24. The allelic frequency of A1 is 0.44 and of A2 is 0.56. In conclusion, the results of present study suggests that in TaqI A polymorphism of DRD2 gene, the frequency of allele A2 is higher than that of A1 allele in population of Eastern Uttar Pradesh.",

The developments described here allow the quantitation of in-vivo protein-protein interactions using a novel GFP-linked reporter system. Here, we have combined this assay with in-vitro X-ray crystallography and molecular dynamics studies characterise the molecular determinants of the interaction between NHERF1 PDZ2 and CFTR, a protein complex pertinent to the genetic disease cystic fibrosis. These studies have revealed the crystal structure of the extended PDZ domain of NHERF1, and indicated, contrary to previous reports, that residue selection at -1 and -3 PDZ-binding motif positions influence the affinity and specificity of the interaction. The results presented here demonstrate that the iBox-PAK4cat assay could easily be utilised to screen other protein-protein interactions.",

    "abstract": "Rod-shaped bacteria frequently localise proteins to one or both cell poles in order to regulate processes such as chromosome replication or polar organelle development. However, the role of such polar factors in responses to extracellular stimuli has been generally unexplored. We employed chemical-genetic screening to probe the interaction between one such factor from Caulobacter crescentus, TipN, and extracellular stress and found that TipN is required for normal tolerance of cell envelope-directed antibiotics, including vancomycin that does not normally inhibit growth of Gram-negative bacteria. Forward genetic screening for suppressors of vancomycin sensitivity in the absence of TipN revealed the TonB-dependent receptor ChvT as the mediator of vancomycin tolerance. Loss of ChvT improved resistance to vancomycin and cefixime in the otherwise sensitive {Delta}tipN strain. The activity of the two-component system regulating ChvT (ChvIG) was increased in {Delta}tipN cells relative to wild type under some, but not all, cell wall stress conditions that this strain was sensitised to, in particular cefixime and detergent exposure. Together, these results indicate that the ChvIG two-component system has been co-opted as a sensor of cell wall stress and that TipN can influence cell envelope stability and ChvIG-mediated signaling in addition to its roles in intracellular development.\\n\\nAuthor summaryMaintenance of an intact cell envelope is essential for free-living bacteria to survive harsh conditions they may encounter in their environment. In the case of rod-shaped bacteria, the poles of the cell are potential weak points in the cell envelope due to the high curvature of the layers and the need to break and re-form parts of the cell envelope at the division plane in order to form new poles as the cells replicate and divide. We have found that TipN, a factor required for correct division and cell pole development in the rod-shaped bacterium, Caulobacter crescentus, is also needed for maintaining normal levels of resistance to cell wall-targeting antibiotics such as vancomycin and cefixime, which interfere with peptidoglycan synthesis. We also identified an outer membrane receptor, ChvT, that was responsible for allowing vancomycin access to the cells and found that the two-component system that negatively regulates ChvT production was activated by various kinds of cell wall stress. Presence or absence of TipN influenced how active this system was in the presence of cefixime or of the membrane-disrupting detergent sodium deoxycholate. Since TipN is normally located at the poles of the cell and at the division plane just before cells complete division, our results suggest that it is involved in stabilisation of these weak points of the cell envelope as well as its other roles inside the cell.",

    "abstract": "Animal behavior constantly adapts to changes, for example when the statistical properties of the environment change unexpectedly. For an agent that interacts with this volatile setting, it is important to react accurately and as quickly as possible. It has already been shown that when a random sequence of motion ramps of a visual target is biased to one direction (e.g. right or left), human observers adapt their eye movements to accurately anticipate the targets expected direction. Here, we prove that this ability extends to a volatile environment where the probability bias could change at random switching times. In addition, we also recorded the explicit prediction of the next outcome as reported by observers using a rating scale. Both results were compared to the estimates of a probabilistic agent that is optimal in relation to the assumed generative model. Compared to the classical leaky integrator model, we found a better match between our probabilistic agent and the behavioral responses, both for the anticipatory eye movements and the explicit task. Furthermore, by controlling the level of preference between exploitation and exploration in the model, we were able to fit for each individuals experimental dataset the most likely level of volatility and analyze inter-individual variability across participants. These results prove that in such an unstable environment, human observers can still represent an internal belief about the environmental contingencies, and use this representation both for sensory-motor control and for explicit judgments. This work offers an innovative approach to more generically test the diversity of human cognitive abilities in uncertain and dynamic environments.\n\nAuthor summaryUnderstanding how humans adapt to changing environments to make judgments or plan motor responses based on time-varying sensory information is crucial for psychology, neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Current theories for how we deal with the environments uncertainty, that is, in response to the introduction of some randomness change, mostly rely on the behavior at equilibrium, long after after a change. Here, we show that in the more ecological case where the context switches at random times all along the experiment, an adaptation to this volatility can be performed online. In particular, we show in two behavioral experiments that humans can adapt to such volatility at the early sensorimotor level, through their anticipatory eye movements, but also at a higher cognitive level, through explicit ratings. Our results suggest that humans (and future artificial systems) can use much richer adaptive strategies than previously assumed.",

However, the mouse pad has been neglected with regard to both research and regular cleaning and disinfection in hospitals. In our study, we monitored and evaluated the bacteriology degrees of 74 computers keyboards, mouses and mouse pads from six departments. The results showed that before cleaning-disinfection, the contamination rate of the mouse pad ranked second following the keyboards. Enterococcus Faecium was cultured from the mouse pads. The computer-related equipment in the wards and outpatient rooms were much more contaminated than that in the operating rooms. Acinetobacter spp. was only isolated from the doctors computers. After cleaning-disinfection, 4 strains of MRSA were isolated from the keyboards and the mouses, one and 3 were cultured at day 3 and day 5 after cleaning-disinfection, respectively. One strain of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa was isolated from the mouses at day 3 after cleaning-disinfection. These demonstrated that the bacterial contamination of the mouse pads must be as emphasized as that of the keyboards and mouses. Furthermore, It is better to clean and disinfect the computer-related equipment(keyboards, mouses, mouse pads) at least once a day.",

In this study, we report the association of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the HOMER1 gene (rs3822568) with specific aspects of sleep in a sample of the Brazilian population. To accomplish this, 1,042 individuals were subjected to a full-night polysomnography, and a subset of 983 subjects had rs3822568 genotyping data available. When compared with the A allele carriers, GG genotyped individuals showed higher sleep latency, lower sleep efficiency, reduced number of arousals per hour, lower apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and lower theta spectral power. In summary, the present findings suggest that the rs3822568 polymorphism in the HOMER1 gene is associated with sleep EEG profiles and might have an impact on sleep quality and sleep structure, with potential to explain inter-individual variation in sleep homeostasis.",

In this study, we investigated the effects of captivity on the fecal bacterial microbiome of an insectivorous microbat, Mops condylurus, a bat species that roosts in close proximity to humans and has likely transmitted viral infections to humans. Using amplicon 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we characterized changes in fecal bacterial community composition for individual bats directly at the time of capture and again after six weeks in captivity. We found that microbial community richness by measure of the number of observed operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in bat feces does increase significantly in captivity. Importantly, we found the similarity of microbial community structures of fecal microbiomes between different bats to converge during captivity. We propose a six week-acclimatization period prior to carrying out infection studies or other research influenced by the microbiome composition, which may be advantageous to reduce variation in microbiome composition and minimize biological variation inherent to in vivo experimental studies.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen. Despite high incidence and morbidity, molecular mechanisms occurring during infection remain largely unknown. Under defined conditions, biofilm formation contributes to the severity of S. aureus related infections. Extracellular DNA (eDNA), a component of biofilm matrix released from apoptotic bacteria, is involved in biofilm structure and stability. In many bacterial biofilms, eDNA originates from cell lysis although eDNA can also be actively secreted or exported by bacterial membrane vesicles. By screening the Nebraska transposon library, we identified rpiRc as a biofilm regulator involved in eDNA regulation. RpiRc is a transcription factor from the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) whose product is a polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) precursor. However, rpiRc mutant strain showed neither susceptibility to DispersinB(R) (a commercially available enzyme disrupting PIA biofilms) nor alteration of ica transcription (the operon regulating PIA production). Decreased biofilm formation was linked to Sln, an extracellular compound degrading eDNA in an autolysis independent pathway. Biofilm susceptibility to antibiotics in wt and mutant strains was tested using a similar protocol as the Calgary biofilm device. Involvement of RpiRc in S. aureus virulence was assessed ex vivo by internalization experiments into HEK293 cells and in vivo in a mouse model of subcutaneous catheter infection. While minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of planktonic cells were not affected in the mutant strain, we observed increased biofilm susceptibility to almost all tested antibiotics, regardless of their mode of action. More importantly, the rpiRc mutant showed reduced virulence in both ex vivo and in vivo experiments related to decreased fnbpA-B transcription and eDNA production. RpiRc is an important regulator involved in eDNA degradation inside the matrix of mature PIA independent biofilms. These results illustrate that RpiRc contributes to increased antibiotic tolerance in mature bacterial biofilm and also to S. aureus cell adhesion and virulence during subcutaneous infection.\\n\\nAuthor summaryBiofilm formation contributes to the severity of Staphylococcus aureus related infections. Biofilm matrix is mainly composed by polysaccharide intercellular adhesion (PIA), proteins and extracellular DNA (eDNA). By screening a mutant library of S. aureus, RpiRc was identified as a new regulator of eDNA dependent biofilm formation. How RpiRc regulates biofilm and its role in S. aureus virulence was studied in four different S. aureus strains. Deletion of RpiRc resulted in a pronounced decreased eDNA dependent biofilm formation, but not PIA dependent biofilm formation. Decreased biofilm formation was not related to increased autolysis, but was linked to extracellular compounds found in the supernatant of mutant biofilms. Sln was identified as one of this compound. RpiRc deletion also decreased biofilm recalcitrance (resistance) to selected antibiotics. Involvement of RpiRc in S. aureus pathogenesis was investigated ex vivo by internalization into HEK293 cells and in vivo in a mouse model of catheter infection. RpiRc deletion resulted in decreased virulence related to decreased expression of surface proteins like the fibronectin binding proteins A and B (FnbpA-B). These results illustrate that RpiRc contributes to increased antibiotic tolerance in mature bacterial biofilm and also to S. aureus cell adhesion and virulence during subcutaneous infection.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated the age-dependency of the neuroprotective effect of an small-conductance calcium activated potassium channel 3 (SK3) agonist, 1-EBIO, on AMPA excitoxicity to dopaminergic neurons (DN) in organotypic cultures. Most TH+ neurons were also SK3+. SK3+/TH-cells (DN+) were common at each developmental stage but more prominently at day in vitro (DIV) 8. Young DN+ neurons were small bipolar and fusiform, whereas mature ones were large and multipolar. Exposure of organotypic cultures to AMPA (100 m, 16 h) had no effect on the survival of DN+ at DIV 8, but caused significant toxicity at DIV 15 (n=15, p=0.005) and DIV 22 (n=15, p<<0.001). These results indicate that susceptibility of DN to AMPA excitotoxicity is developmental stage-dependent in embryonic VM organotypic cultures. Immature DN+ (small, bipolar) were increased after AMPA (100 m, 16 h) at DIV 8, at the expense of the number of differentiated (large, multipolar) DN+ (p=0.039). This effect was larger at DIV 15 (p<<<0.0001) and at DIV 22 (p<<<0.0001). At DIV 8, 30 M 1-EBIO resulted in a large increase in DN+. At DIV 15, AMPA toxicity was prevented by exposure to 30 M, but not 100 M 1-EBIO. At DIV 22, excitotoxicity was unaffected by 30 M 1-EBIO, and partially reduced by 100 M 1-EBIO. The effects of the SK3. channel agonist 1-EBIO on the survival of SK3.-expressing dopaminergic neurons were concentrationdependent and influenced by neuronal developmental stage.",
