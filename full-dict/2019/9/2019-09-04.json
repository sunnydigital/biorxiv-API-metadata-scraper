    "abstract": "ObjectiveEndothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) promote the maintenance of the endothelium by the secretion of vasoreparative factors. A population of EPCs known as early outgrowth cells (EOCs) are currently being investigated as novel cell-based therapies for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. We previously demonstrated that the absence of liver x receptors (LXRs) is detrimental to the formation and function of EOCs under hypercholesterolemic conditions. Here, we investigate whether LXR gain-of-function in EOCs is beneficial for the treatment of atherosclerosis.\\n\\nApproach and ResultsEOCs were differentiated from the bone marrow of wildtype (WT) and LXR-knockout (Lxr{beta}-/-) mice in the presence of vehicle or LXR agonist (GW3965). WT EOCs treated with GW3965 throughout differentiation showed reduced expression of endothelial lineage markers (Cd144, Vegfr2) compared to WT vehicle and Lxr{beta}-/- cells. GW3965-treated EOCs produced secreted factors that reduced monocyte adhesion to activated endothelial cells in culture. When injected into atherosclerosis-prone Ldlr-/- mice, GW3965-treated EOCs and concentrated conditioned media (CM) from GW3965-treated EOCs, reduced plaque burden within the aortic sinus. Furthermore, when CM from human EOCs (obtained from patients with established CAD) were treated with GW3965, monocyte to endothelial adhesion was decreased suggesting the translatability of the results.\\n\\nConclusionsEx vivo LXR agonist treatment of EOCs produces a secretome that decreases early atherosclerosis in Ldlr-/- mice. CM from human EOCs significantly inhibits monocyte to endothelial adhesion. Thus, active factor(s) within the GW3965-treated EOC secretome have the potential to be useful for the treatment of atherosclerosis.",

    "abstract": "Macaques are one of the most widely used model organisms in biomedical research. Macaca mulatta and M. fascicularis are currently being used for toxicology, HIV, diabetes, neuroscience and psychiatric and psychological disorder researches. Many studies have been conducted on M. mulatta and M. fascicularis genomes for this purpose in order to understand the genomic properties of these species. Several M. fascicularis individuals from different geographical locations and also M. mulatta genomes have been sequenced and studied in depth for the purpose of understanding the phylogenetic and evolutionary relationships between various macaque populations. But still a gap in knowledge remains for other macaque populations such as the Sinica group. In this study for the very first time, we sequenced the exome of toque macaques (M. sinica), an endemic island population of Sri Lanka. Here we confirmed that M. sinica and M. thibetana cluster together and are closely related, also the three distinct phylogenetic groupings of fascicularis and sinica. We also found that M. sinica has less number of polymorphisms with respect to the reference genome M. mulatta signifying the smaller and restricted population size of this species.",

    "abstract": "The proportion of samples with one or more close relatives in a genetic dataset increases rapidly with sample size, necessitating relatedness modeling and enabling pedigree-based analyses. Despite this, relatives are generally unreported and current inference methods typically detect only the degree of relatedness of sample pairs and not pedigree relationships. We developed CREST, an accurate and fast method that identifies the pedigree relationships of close relatives. CREST utilizes identical by descent (IBD) segments shared between a pair of samples and their mutual relatives, leveraging the fact that sharing rates among these individuals differ across pedigree configurations. Furthermore, CREST exploits the profound differences in sex-specific genetic maps to classify pairs as maternally or paternally related--e.g., paternal half-siblings--using the locations of autosomal IBD segments shared between the pair. In simulated data, CREST correctly classifies 91.5-99.5% of grandparent-grandchild (GP) pairs, 70.5-97.0% of avuncular (AV) pairs, and 79.0-98.0% of half-siblings (HS) pairs compared to PADREs rates of 38.5-76.0% of GP, 60.5-92.0% of AV, 73.0-95.0% of HS pairs. Turning to the real 20,032 sample Generation Scotland (GS) dataset, CREST correctly determines the relationship of 99.0% of GP, 85.7% of AV, and 95.0% of HS pairs that have sufficient mutual relative data, completing this analysis in 10.1 CPU hours including IBD detection. CRESTs maternal and paternal relationship inference is also accurate, as it flagged five pairs as incorrectly labeled in the GS pedigrees-- three of which we confirmed as mistakes, and two with an uncertain relationship--yielding 99.7% of HS and 93.5% of GP pairs correctly classified.",

    "abstract": "The bacterium E. coli can initiate replication in the absence of the replication initiator protein DnaA and / or the canonical origin of replication oriC in a{Delta} rnhA background. This phenomenon, which can be primed by R-loops, is called constitutive stable DNA replication (cSDR). Whether DNA replication during cSDR initiates in a stochastic manner through the length of the chromosome or at specific sites, and how E. coli can find adaptations to loss of fitness caused by cSDR remain inadequately answered. We use laboratory evolution experiments of{Delta} rnhA-{Delta}dnaA followed by deep sequencing to show that DNA replication preferentially initiates within a broad region located [~]0.4-0.7 Mb clockwise of oriC. This region includes many bisulfite-sensitive sites, which have been previously defined as R-loop forming regions; and includes a site containing sequence motifs that favour R-loop formation. Initiation from this region would result in head-on replication-transcription conflicts at rRNA loci. Inversions of these rRNA loci, which can partly resolve these conflicts, help the bacterium suppress the fitness defects of cSDR. These inversions partially restore the gene expression changes brought about by cSDR. The inversion however increases the possibility of conflicts at essential mRNA genes, which would utilise only a miniscule fraction of RNA polymerase molecules most of which transcribe rRNA genes. Whether subsequent adaptive strategies would attempt to resolve these conflicts remains an open question.\n\nImportanceThe bacterium E. coli can replicate its DNA even in the absence of the molecules that are required for canonical replication initiation. This often requires the formation of RNA-DNA hybrid structures, and is referred to as constitutive stable DNA replication (cSDR). Where on the chromosome does cSDR initiate? We answer this question using laboratory evolution experiments and genomics, and show that selection favours cSDR initiation predominantly at a region [~]0.6 Mb clockwise of oriC. Initiation from this site will result in more head on collisions of DNA polymerase with RNA polymerase operating on rRNA loci. The bacterium adapts to this problem by inverting a region of the genome including several rRNA loci such that head-on collisions between the two polymerases are minimised. Understanding such evolutionary strategies in the context of cSDR can provide insights into the potential causes of resistance against antibiotics that target initiation of DNA replication.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of different nutrient formulations as biostimulation agents, in order to improve the elimination of diesel fuel from Antarctic soils, in both oxic and anoxic conditions. A field test was performed in microcosms (15 kg of soil each) as experimental systems. Each microcosm was prepared by triplicate, sampled every 10 days over a 50-days period and sampled again one year later. Changes in bacterial communities, and qualitative and quantitative HCs analysis were determined. Our results showed that, during the early stages of the process, a multi-component commercial product like OSEII(R) (containing nutrients, enzymes and surfactants) determines a rapid elimination of HCs with changes in the structure of the bacterial soil community, whereas a more cost-effective slow-release fertilizer like Nitrofoska(R) would be efficient in a long-term bioremediation process.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWolbachia, one of the most abundant taxa of intracellular Alphaproteobacteria, is widespread among arthropods and filarial nematodes. The presence of these maternally inherited bacteria is associated with modifications of host fitness, including a variety of reproductive abnormalities, such as cytoplasmic incompatibility, thelytokous parthenogenesis, host feminization and male-killing. Wolbachia has attracted much interest for its role in biological, ecological and evolutionary processes as well as for its potential use in novel and environmentally-friendly strategies for the control of insect pests and disease vectors including a major agricultural pest, the South American fruit fly, Anastrepha fraterculus Wiedemann (Diptera: Tephritidae).\\n\\nResultsWe used wsp, 16S rRNA and a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme including gatB, coxA, hcpA, fbpA, and ftsZ genes to detect and characterize the Wolbachia infection in laboratory strains and wild populations of A. fraterculus from Argentina. Wolbachia was found in all A. fraterculus individuals studied. Nucleotide sequences analysis of wsp gene allowed the identification of two Wolbachia nucleotide variants (named wAfraCast1_A and wAfraCast2_A). After the analysis of 76 individuals, a high prevalence of the wAfraCast2_A variant was found both, in laboratory (82%) and wild populations (95%). MLST analysis identified both Wolbachia genetic variants as sequence type 13. Phylogenetic analysis of concatenated MLST datasets clustered wAfraCast1/2_A in the supergroup A. Paired-crossing experiments among single infected laboratory strains showed a phenotype specifically associated to wAfraCast1_A that includes slight detrimental effects on larval survival, a female-biased sex ratio; suggesting the induction of male-killing phenomena, and a decreased proportion of females producing descendants that appears attributable to the lack of sperm in their spermathecae.\\n\\nConclusionsWe detected and characterized at the molecular level two wsp gene sequence variants of Wolbachia both in laboratory and wild populations of A. fraterculus sp.1 from Argentina. Crossing experiments on singly-infected A. fraterculus strains showed evidence of a male killing-like mechanism potentially associated to the wAfraCast1_A - A. fraterculus interactions. Further mating experiments including antibiotic treatments and the analysis of early and late immature stages of descendants will contribute to our understanding of the phenotypes elicited by the Wolbachia variant wAfraCast1_A in A. fraterculus sp.1.",

Extinction procedures can weaken this association between drug-associated cues and drug-taking behavior and may reduce the probability of relapse. This study evaluated a regimen of extinction training on cocaine and heroin self-administration in rhesus monkeys under a drug-vs.-food choice procedure. Behavior was initially maintained under a concurrent schedule of food (1-g food pellets; fixed-ratio 100 schedule) and cocaine injections (0-0.1 mg/kg/injection; fixed-ratio 10) (n=4 males) or heroin injections (0-0.01 mg/kg/injection; fixed-ratio 10) (n=3 females and 1 male) during daily 2-h choice sessions. Subsequently, choice sessions were supplemented by daily 20-h extinction sessions for 14 consecutive days. During extinction sessions, drug-associated discriminative stimuli were presented, but responding produced saline injections. Drug continued to be available during choice sessions. Prior to extinction, both cocaine- and heroin-maintained dose-dependent increases in drug-vs.-food choice. Exposure to 14 extinction sessions failed to significantly decrease drug choice and increase food choice. These preclinical results do not support the effectiveness of extinguishing drug-associated discriminative stimuli as a non-pharmacological treatment strategy for reducing drug choice.",

Whilst the concept of stochastic damage is often invoked as the driver of the ageing process, this can be too abstract to understand ageing at a higher mechanistic resolution. However, there do exist general mechanisms that describe how stochastic damage interferes with biological function, such as through genetic mutations. In a similar manner, we argue that a  molecular habituation phenomenon occurs during biological ageing where constitutive signals arising from damage accumulation drive an average decrease in network sensitivity and information transmission, as well as an increase in noise, across cells and tissue.",

Peroxisome Biogenesis Factor (Peroxin, Pex) genes encode proteins essential to peroxisome biogenesis or function. In yeast and mammals, PEROXIN7 acts as a cytosolic receptor protein that targets a subset of enzymes for peroxisome matrix import.\\n\\nProteins targeted by PEROXIN7 contain a peroxisome targeting sequence 2 (PTS2) motif. The PTS2 was not found in the D. melanogaster homologs of proteins that are PEROXIN7 targets in yeast or mammals, however comparative genomics suggest a Pex7 homolog is present in the D. melanogaster genome. Herein we report novel, tissue-specific patterns for transcription and translation of Pex7 in the D. melanogaster embryo that appear to be strongest in presumptive neuronal lineages. We also show that targeted somatic Pex7 knockout in neural precursors via targeted somatic CRISPR knockout affected survival of mutant embryos. Pex7 over-expression via Gal4-UAS also reduced adult survival but was not deleterious at the embryo stage. Notably, targeted somatic rescue of Pex7 in the neural precursors of Pex7 homozygous mutants also impaired embryo survival. We conclude that D. melanogaster has tissue-specific developmental requirements of Pex7 expression. This may be related to the requirement for peroxisome-mediated lipid synthesis in cells of the central nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids; n-3 PUFAs) are essential for the functional maturation of the brain. Westernization of dietary habits in both developed and developing countries is accompanied by a progressive reduction in dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs. Low maternal intake of n-3 PUFAs has been linked to neurodevelopmental diseases in epidemiological studies, but the mechanisms by which a n-3 PUFA dietary imbalance affects CNS development are poorly understood. Active microglial engulfment of synaptic elements is an important process for normal brain development and altered synapse refinement is a hallmark of several neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we identify a molecular mechanism for detrimental effects of low maternal n-3 PUFA intake on hippocampal development. Our results show that maternal dietary n-3 PUFA deficiency increases microglial phagocytosis of synaptic elements in the developing hippocampus, through the activation of 12/15- lipoxygenase (LOX)/12-HETE signaling, which alters neuronal morphology and affects cognition in the postnatal offspring. While women of child bearing age are at higher risk of dietary n-3 PUFA deficiency, these findings provide new insights into the mechanisms linking maternal nutrition to neurodevelopmental disorders.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryLow maternal omega-3 fatty acids intake impairs microglia-mediated synaptic refinement via 12-HETE pathway in the developing brain.",

    "abstract": "Throughout the vector-borne disease modeling literature, there exist two general frameworks for incorporating vector management strategies (e.g. area-wide adulticide spraying and larval source reduction campaigns) into vector population models, namely, the \\\"implicit\\\" and \\\"explicit\\\" control frameworks. The more simplistic \\\"implicit\\\" framework facilitates derivation of mathematically rigorous results on disease suppression and optimal control, but the biological connection of these results to realworld \\\"explicit\\\" control actions that could guide specific management actions is vague at best. Here, we formally define the biological and mathematical relationships between implicit and explicit control, and we provide detailed mathematical expressions relating the strength of implicit control to management-relevant properties of explicit control for four common intervention strategies. These expressions allow optimal control and sensitivity analysis results in existing implicit control studies to be interpreted in terms of real world actions. Our work reveals a previously unknown fact: implicit control is a meaningful approximation of explicit control only when resonance-like synergistic effects between multiple controls have a negligible effect on average population reduction. When non-negligible synergy exists, implicit control results, despite their mathematical tidiness, fail to provide accurate predictions regarding vector control and disease spread. The methodology we establish can be applied to study the interaction of phenological effects with control strategies, and we present a new technique for finding impulse control strategies that optimally reduce a vector population in the presence of seasonally oscillating model parameters. Collectively, these elements build an effective bridge between analytically interesting and mathematically tractable implicit control and the challenging, action-oriented explicit control.",

    "abstract": "Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are common hospital-acquired infections and frequently polymicrobial, which complicates effective treatment. However, few studies experimentally address the consequences of polymicrobial interactions within the urinary tract, and the clinical significance of polymicrobial bacteriuria is not fully understood. Proteus mirabilis is one of the most common causes of monomicrobial and polymicrobial CAUTI, and frequently co-colonizes with Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Providencia stuartii, and Morganella morganii. P. mirabilis infections are particularly challenging due to its potent urease enzyme, which facilitates formations of struvite crystals, catheter encrustation, blockage, and formation of urinary stones. We previously determined that interactions between P. mirabilis and other uropathogens can enhance P. mirabilis urease activity, resulting in greater disease severity during experimental polymicrobial infection. Our present work reveals that M. morganii acts on P. mirabilis in a contact-independent manner to decrease urease activity. Furthermore, M. morganii actively prevents urease enhancement by E. faecalis, P. stuartii, and E. coli. Importantly, these interactions translate to modulation of disease severity during experimental CAUTI, predominantly through a urease-dependent mechanism. Thus, products secreted by multiple bacterial species in the milieu of the catheterized urinary tract can directly impact prognosis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn recent years, the rapid development of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques enables the quantitative characterization of cell types at a single-cell resolution. With the explosive growth of the number of cells profiled in individual scRNA-seq experiments, there is a demand for novel computational methods for classifying newly-generated scRNA-seq data onto annotated labels. Although several methods have recently been proposed for the cell-type classification of single-cell transcriptomic data, such limitations as inadequate accuracy, inferior robustness, and low stability greatly limit their wide applications.\\n\\nResultsWe propose a novel ensemble approach, named EnClaSC, for accurate and robust cell-type classification of single-cell transcriptomic data. Through comprehensive validation experiments, we demonstrate that EnClaSC can not only be applied to the self-projection within a specific dataset and the cell-type classification across different datasets, but also scale up well to various data dimensionality and different data sparsity. We further illustrate the ability of EnClaSC to effectively make cross-species classification, which may shed light on the studies in correlation of different species. EnClaSC is freely available at https://github.com/xy-chen16/EnClaSC.\\n\\nConclusionsEnClaSC enables highly accurate and robust cell-type classification of single-cell transcriptomic data via an ensemble learning method. We expect to see wide applications of our method to not only transcriptome studies, but also the classification of more general data.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveREM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a prodromal synucleinopathy, as >80% will eventually convert to overt synucleinopathy. We performed an in-depth analysis of the SNCA locus to identify RBD-specific risk variants.\\n\\nMethodsFull sequencing and genotyping of SNCA was performed in isolated/idiopathic RBD (iRBD, n=1,076), Parkinsons disease (PD, n=1,013), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n=415), and in control subjects (n=6,155). A replication cohort from 23andMe of PD patients with probable RBD (pRBD) was also analyzed (cases n=1,782, controls n=131,250). Adjusted logistic regression models and meta-analyses were performed. Effects on conversion rate were analyzed in 432 RBD patients with available data using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.\\n\\nResultsA 5-region SNCA variant (rs10005233) was associated with iRBD (OR=1.43, p=1.1E-08), which was replicated in pRBD. This variant is in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with other 5 risk variants across the different synucleinopathies. An independent iRBD-specific suggestive association (rs11732740) was detected at the 3 of SNCA (OR=1.32, p=4.7E-04, not statistically significant after Bonferroni correction). Homozygous carriers of both iRBD-specific SNPs were at highly increased risk for iRBD (OR=5.74, p=2E-06). The known top PD-associated variant (3 variant rs356182) had an opposite direction of effect in iRBD compared to PD.\\n\\nInterpretationThere is a distinct pattern of association at the SNCA locus in RBD as compared to PD, with an opposite direction of effect at the 3 of SNCA.

    "abstract": "Host selection is often required to foster beneficial microbial symbionts and suppress deleterious pathogens. In animals, the host immune system is at the center of this relationship. Failed host immune system-microbial interactions can result in a persistent inflammatory response in which the immune system indiscriminately attacks resident microbes, and at times the host cells themselves, leading to diseases such as Ulcerative Colitis, Crohns Disease, and Psoriasis. Host genetic variation has been linked to both microbiome diversity and to severity of such inflammatory disease states in humans. However, the microbiome and inflammatory states manifest as quantitative traits, which encompass many genes interacting with one another and the environment. The mechanistic relationships among all of these interacting components are still not clear. Developing natural genetic models of host-microbe interactions is therefore fundamental to understanding the complex genetics of these and other diseases. Threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) fish are a tractable model for attacking this problem because of abundant population-level genetic and phenotypic variation in the gut inflammatory response. Previous work in our laboratory identified genetically divergent stickleback populations exhibiting differences in intestinal neutrophil activity. We took advantage of this diversity to genetically map variation in an emblematic element of gut inflammation - intestinal neutrophil recruitment - using an F2-intercross mapping framework. We identified three regions of the genome associated with increased intestinal inflammation containing several promising candidate genes. Within these regions we found candidates in the Coagulation/Complement System, NFkB and MAPK pathways along with several genes associated with neurodegenerative diseases commonly accompanying intestinal inflammation as a secondary symptom. These findings highlight the utility of using naturally genetically diverse  evolutionary mutant models such as threespine stickleback to better understand interactions among host genetic diversity and microbiome variation in health and disease states.",

    "abstract": "Viruses have evolved strategies that highlight critical, intertwined host immune mechanisms. As postulated by the missing-self hypothesis, natural killer (NK) cells and major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I)-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) have opposing requirements for ubiquitously expressed MHC-I molecules. Since NK cell MHC-I-specific Ly49 inhibitory receptors prevent killing of cells with normal MHC-I, viruses evading CTLs by down-regulating MHC-I should be vulnerable to NK cells. However, definitive integrated in vivo evidence for this interplay has been lacking, in part due to receptor polymorphism and a proposed second function of Ly49 receptors in licensing NK cells via self-MHC-I. Here we generated mice lacking specific Ly49 inhibitory receptors to show their essential role in licensing and controlling murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection in vivo in an MHC-restricted manner. When MCMV cannot down-regulate MHC-I, NK cells cannot control infection that instead is mediated by CTLs, as predicted by the missing-self hypothesis.",

We integrated and optimized multiple recent developments to establish a proteomics workflow to quantify proteins from as few as 1,000 mammalian stem cells. The method uses chemical peptide labeling, does not require specific equipment other than cell lysis tools, and quantifies >2,500 proteins with high reproducibility. We validated the method by comparing mouse embryonic stem cells and in vitro differentiated motor neurons. We identify differentially expressed proteins with small fold-changes, and a dynamic range in abundance similar to that of standard methods. Protein abundance measurements obtained with our protocol compare well to corresponding transcript abundance and to measurements using standard inputs. The protocol is also applicable to other systems, such as FACS-purified cells from the tunicate Ciona.

The molecular mechanisms that drive these stalling events, however, are still unknown. Here, we use a combination of in vitro biochemistry, ribosome profiling, and cryo-EM to define molecular mechanisms that lead to these ribosome stalls. First, we use an in vitro reconstituted yeast translation system to demonstrate that inhibitory codon pairs slow elongation rates which are partially rescued by increased tRNA concentration or by an artificial tRNA not dependent on wobble base pairing. Ribosome profiling data extend these observations by revealing that paused ribosomes with empty A sites are enriched on these sequences. Cryo-EM structures of stalled ribosomes provide a structural explanation for the observed effects by showing decoding-incompatible conformations of mRNA in the A sites of all studied stall-inducing sequences. Interestingly, in the case of poly(A) tracts, the inhibitory conformation of the mRNA in the A site involves a nucleotide stacking array. Together, these data demonstrate novel mRNA-induced mechanisms of translational stalling in eukaryotic ribosomes.",

    "abstract": "Dendritic cell therapy has been a promising addition to the current armoury of therapeutic options in cancer for more than 20 years but has not yet achieved break-through success. To successfully initiate immunity, dendritic cells have to enter the lymph nodes. However, previous experience of therapeutic dendritic cell administration indicates that this is frequently an extremely inefficient process. The major regulator of dendritic cell migration to the lymph nodes is the chemokine receptor CCR7 and in vitro generated dendritic cells typically display heterogenous expression of this receptor. Here we demonstrate that positive-selection for the dendritic cell subpopulation expressing CCR7 enriches for cells with enhanced lymph node migration and antigen presentation competence as well as a chemokine expression profile indicative of improved interactions with T cells. In models of both subcutaneous and metastatic melanoma we demonstrate that the dendritic cells sorted for CCR7 expression trigger enhanced CD8 T-cell driven antitumour immune responses which correlate with reduced tumour burden and increased survival. Finally we demonstrate that this approach is directly translatable to human dendritic cell therapy using clinical-grade cell sorting.\\n\\nSynopsisTherapeutic dendritic cells drive anti-cancer immune responses but they migrate inefficiently to lymph nodes.

We further observed a surprising biased one-dimensional diffusion of Cas9 from 3 to 5 end of the non-target strand under physiological salt condition, whereas low ionic concentration or mutations on PAM recognition residues induce unbiased one-dimensional diffusion of Cas9 along dsDNA. We quantified the diffusion length of 27 bp, which accelerates the target search efficiency of Cas9 by [~] 10 folds.

    "abstract": "Early identification of individuals at risk of developing Alzheimers disease (AD) dementia is important for developing disease-modifying therapies. In this study, given multimodal AD markers and clinical diagnosis of an individual from one or more timepoints, we seek to predict the clinical diagnosis, cognition and ventricular volume of the individual for every month (indefinitely) into the future. We proposed and applied a minimal recurrent neural network (minimalRNN) model to data from The Alzheimers Disease Prediction Of Longitudinal Evolution (TADPOLE) challenge, comprising longitudinal data of 1677 participants (Marinescu et al. 2018) from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We compared the performance of the minimalRNN model and four baseline algorithms up to 6 years into the future. Most previous work on predicting AD progression ignore the issue of missing data, which is a prevalent issue in longitudinal data. Here, we explored three different strategies to handle missing data. Two of the strategies treated the missing data as a \"preprocessing\" issue, by imputing the missing data using the previous timepoint (\"forward filling\") or linear interpolation (\"linear filling). The third strategy utilized the minimalRNN model itself to fill in the missing data both during training and testing (\"model filling\"). Our analyses suggest that the minimalRNN with \"model filling\" compared favorably with baseline algorithms, including support vector machine/regression, linear state space (LSS) model, and long short-term memory (LSTM) model. Importantly, although the training procedure utilized longitudinal data, we found that the trained minimalRNN model exhibited similar performance, when using only 1 input timepoint or 4 input timepoints, suggesting that our approach might work well with just cross-sectional data. An earlier version of our approach was ranked 5th (out of 53 entries) in the TADPOLE challenge in 2019. The current approach is ranked 2nd out of 63 entries as of June 3rd, 2020.",

    "abstract": "Many animals have large visual fields, and sensory circuits may sample those regions of visual space most relevant to behaviours such as gaze stabilisation and hunting. Despite this, relatively small displays are often used in vision neuroscience. To sample stimulus locations across most of the visual field, we built a spherical stimulus arena with 14,848 independently controllable LEDs, measured the optokinetic response gain of immobilised zebrafish larvae, and related behaviour to previously published retinal photoreceptor densities. We measured tuning to steradian stimulus size and spatial frequency, and show it to be independent of visual field position. However, zebrafish react most strongly and consistently to lateral, nearly equatorial stimuli, consistent with previously reported higher spatial densities in the central retina of red, green and blue photoreceptors. Upside-down experiments suggest further extra-retinal processing. Our results demonstrate that motion vision circuits in zebrafish are anisotropic, and preferentially monitor areas with putative behavioural relevance.\n\nAuthor summaryThe visual system of larval zebrafish mirrors many features present in the visual system of other vertebrates, including its ability to mediate optomotor and optokinetic behaviour. Although the presence of such behaviours and some of the underlying neural correlates have been firmly established, previous experiments did not consider the large visual field of zebrafish, which covers more than 160{degrees} for each eye. Given that different parts of the visual field likely carry unequal amount of behaviourally relevant information for the animal, this raises the question whether optic flow is integrated across the entire visual field or just parts of it, and how this shapes behaviour such as the optokinetic response. We constructed a spherical LED arena to present visual stimuli almost anywhere across their visual field, while tracking horizontal eye movements. By displaying moving gratings on this LED arena, we demonstrate that the optokinetic response, one of the most prominent visually induced behaviours of zebrafish, indeed strongly depends on stimulus location and stimulus size, as well as on other parameters such as the spatial and temporal frequency of the gratings. This location dependence is consistent with areas of high retinal photoreceptor densities, though evidence suggests further extraretinal processing.",

    "abstract": "Serotonin receptor 4 (5-HT4R) plays an important role in regulating mood, anxiety, and cognition, and drugs that activate this receptor have fast-acting antidepressant (AD)-like effects in preclinical models. However, 5-HT4R is widely expressed throughout the central nervous system (CNS) and periphery, making it a poor therapeutic target and difficult to pinpoint the cell types and circuits underlying its effects. Therefore, we generated a Cre-dependent 5-HT4R knockout mouse line to dissect the function of 5-HT4R in specific brain regions and cell types. We show that the loss of functional 5-HT4R specifically in the mature excitatory neurons of hippocampus led to robust AD-like behavioral responses and an elevation in baseline anxiety. 5-HT4R was necessary to maintain the proper excitability of mature dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells and cell type specific molecular profiling revealed a dysregulation of genes necessary for normal neural function and plasticity in cells lacking 5-HT4R. These adaptations were accompanied by an increase in the number of immature neurons in ventral, but not dorsal, dentate gyrus, indicating a broad impact of 5-HT4R loss on the local cellular environment. This study is the first to use conditional genetic targeting to demonstrate a direct role for hippocampal 5-HT4R signaling in modulating mood and anxiety. Our findings also underscore the need for cell type-based approaches to elucidate the complex action of neuromodulatory systems on distinct neural circuits.",

    "abstract": "Memory is thought to be encoded by sparsely distributed neuronal ensembles in memory-related regions. However, it is unclear how memory-eligible neurons react incrementally during learning to encode trace fear memory, and how they respond to cues to retrieve the memory. We implemented fiber-optic confocal fluorescence endoscopy to directly visualize calcium dynamics of hippocampal CA1 neurons in freely behaving mice, which were subjected to trace fear conditioning. Here we report that the overall activity levels of CA1 principal neurons showed a right-skewed lognormal-like distribution. A small portion of highly active neurons (termed Primed Neurons) exhibited high sensitivity to sensory stimuli and marked activity plasticity. The Primed Neurons maintained random activity status for at least 5 hours in multiple contexts, including those prior to training and prior to recall. Repetitive training induced Primed Neurons to shift from random activity to a well-tuned synchronization. Importantly, the emergence of activity synchronization coincided with the appearance of mouse freezing behaviors. In recall, a partial synchronization among the same population of Primed Neurons was induced from originally random activity, which also coincided with mouse freezing behaviors. Additionally, training-induced synchronization facilitated robust calcium entry into individual Primed Neurons. In contrast, most CA1 neurons stayed silent and did not respond significantly to tone and foot-shock throughout the training and recall testing cycles. In conclusion, highly active Primed Neurons are preferably recruited to encode trace fear memory, and induction of activity synchronization among Primed Neurons out of random dynamics is critical for trace memory formation and memory retrieval.\\n\\nSignificance StatementO_LIThe overall activity levels of hippocampal principal CA1 neurons show a right-skewed lognormal-like distribution.\\nC_LIO_LIA small portion of CA1 neurons (termed Primed Neurons) exhibit high activity and marked activity plasticity during learning and recall.\\nC_LIO_LIPrimed Neurons in the hippocampus are preferably recruited to encode trace fear memory, whereas the majority of CA1 neurons show little activity and little activity change during fear conditioning and recall testing.\\nC_LIO_LIInduction of activity synchronization among Primed Neurons out of random dynamics is critical for trace memory formation and memory retrieval.\\nC_LIO_LITraining-induced synchronization drastically increases calcium entry into Primed Neurons, which may promote memory consolidation.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "In the central nervous system, certain neurons store zinc within the synaptic vesicles of their axon terminals. This vesicular zinc can then be released in an activity-dependent fashion as an intercellular signal. The functions of vesicular zinc are not entirely understood, but evidence suggests that it is important for some forms of experience-dependent plasticity in the brain. The ability of neurons to store and release vesicular zinc is dependent on expression of the vesicular zinc transporter, ZnT3. Here, we examined the neuronal morphology of mice that lack ZnT3. Brains were collected from mice housed under standard laboratory conditions and from mice housed in enriched environments - large, multilevel enclosures with running wheels, numerous objects and tunnels, and a greater number of cage mates. Golgi-Cox staining was used to visualize neurons for analysis of dendritic length and dendritic spine density. Neurons were analyzed from the barrel cortex, striatum, basolateral amygdala, and hippocampus (CA1). ZnT3 knockout mice, relative to wild type mice, exhibited increased basal dendritic length in the layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of barrel cortex, independently of housing condition. Environmental enrichment decreased apical dendritic length in these same neurons and increased dendritic spine density on striatal medium spiny neurons. Elimination of ZnT3 did not modulate any of the effects of enrichment. Our results provide no evidence that vesicular zinc is required for the experience-dependent changes that occur in response to environmental enrichment. They are consistent, however, with recent reports suggesting increased cortical volume in ZnT3 knockout mice.",

Despite this, devices that can provide precise current or voltage stimulation are expensive and closed-source. Here, we introduce Stimjim, a capable and inexpensive ($200 USD) open-source instrument for electrical stimulation that combines both function generation and electrical isolation. Stimjim provides microsecond temporal resolution with microampere or millivolt scale precision on two electrically isolated output channels. We demonstrate Stimjims utility both in vitro by precisely stimulating brain slices, and in vivo by training mice to perform intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) for brain stimulation reward. During ICSS, Stimjim enables the experimenter to smoothly tune the strength of reward-seeking behavior by varying either the output frequency or amplitude. We envision Stimjim will enable new kinds of experiments due to its open-source and scalable nature.",

    "abstract": "Myelinating Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) express numerous ion channels and transporters, and have the capacity to respond to neuronal activity. However, it remains unknown how the response of Schwann cells to neuronal activity affects peripheral nerve formation, health or function in vivo. Through a genetic screen in zebrafish, we identified a mutant, ue58, with severe disruption to the morphology of myelin along peripheral nerves and associated nerve oedema. Molecular analyses indicated that this phenotype was caused by the loss of function of a previously uncharacterized gene, slc12a2b, which encodes a zebrafish paralog of the solute carrier NKCC1. NKCC1 is a co-transporter of Na+, K+, and Cl- ions and water, typically from the extracellular space into cells. Upon impairing slc12a2b function, constitutively, or specifically in neurons or myelinating Schwann cells, we observed disruption to myelin and nerve oedema. Strikingly, we found that treatment of slc12a2b mutants with TTX completely prevented the emergence of these pathologies. Furthermore, TTX treatment rescued pathology in animals with cell-type specific loss of slc12a2b from myelinating Schwann cells. Together our data indicate that NKCC1 regulates ion homeostasis following neuronal activity and that this is required to maintain myelinated axon and peripheral nerve integrity.",

    "abstract": "Secretion of bacterial effector proteins into host cells plays a key role in bacterial virulence. Yet, the dynamics of the secretion systems activity remains poorly understood, especially when machineries deal with the export of numerous effectors. We address the question of multi-effector secretion by focusing on the Legionella pneumophila Icm/Dot T4SS that translocates a record number of 300 effectors. We set up a kinetic translocation assay, based on the {beta}-lactamase translocation reporter system combined with the effect of the protonophore CCCP. When used for translocation analysis of Icm/Dot substrates constitutively produced by L. pneumophila, this assay allows a fine monitoring of the secretion activity of the T4SS, independently of the expression control of the effectors. We observed that effectors are translocated with a specific timing, suggesting a control of their docking/translocation by the T4SS. Their delivery is accurately organized to allow effective manipulation of the host cell, as exemplified by the sequential translocation of effectors targeting Rab1, namely SidM/DrrA, LidA, LepB. Remarkably, the timed delivery of effectors does not depend only on their interaction with chaperone proteins but implies cyclic-di-GMP signaling, as the diguanylate cyclase Lpl0780/Lpp0809, contributes to the timing of translocation.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=179 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/754762v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (38K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17b7245org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18b2443org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f9b7ceorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19275ff_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIThe dynamics of multi-effector secretion is addressed in the paradigm Legionella Icm/Dot T4SS\nC_LIO_LIA kinetic translocation assay allowing a fine monitoring of the T4SS activity is set up\nC_LIO_LISpecific secretion patterns consistent with sequential functions in the host are reported\nC_LIO_LIT4SS-dependent translocation is promoted by a diguanylate cyclase\nC_LIO_LIUnreported control of Type 4 secretion by the second messenger c-di-GMP signaling is revealed\nC_LI",

AlleleDB is a high-quality resource that reports on about 30,000 ASE variants (ASE-V) from hundreds of human samples. In this study, we present the genomic characteristics and phenotypic implications of ASE. We identified tens of segments with extreme density of ASE-V, many of them are located at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus. Notably, at a resolution of 100 nucleotides, the likelihood of ASE-V increases with the density of polymorphic sites. Another dominant trend of ASE is a strong bias of the expression to the major allele. This observation relies on the known allele frequencies in the healthy human population. Overlap of ASE-V and GWAS associations was calculated for 48 phenotypes from the UK-Biobank. ASE-V were significantly associated with a risk for inflammation (e.g. asthma), autoimmunity (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and type 1 diabetes) and several blood cell traits (e.g., red cell distribution width). At the level of the ASE-genes, we seek association with all traits and conditions reported in the GWAS catalog. The statistical significance of ASE-genes to GWAS catalog reveals association with the susceptibility to virus infection, autoimmunity, inflammation, allergies, blood cancer and more. We postulate that ASE determines phenotype diversity between individuals and the risk for a variety of immune-related conditions.",

    "abstract": "Plasmids, when transferred by conjugation, must overpass restriction-modification systems of the recipient cell. We demonstrate that protein ArdC, encoded by broad host range plasmid R388, was required for conjugation from Escherichia coli to Pseudomonas putida, but not from E. coli to E. coli. Surprisingly, expression of ardC was required in the recipient cells, but not in the donor cells. Besides, ardC was not required for conjugation if the hsdRMS system was deleted in P. putida recipient cells. Thus, ArdC has antirestriction activity against HsdRMS system, and consequently broadens R388 plasmid host range. The crystal structure of ArdC was solved both in the absence and in the presence of Mn2+. ArdC is composed of a non-specific ssDNA binding N-terminal domain and a C-terminal metalloprotease domain, although the metalloprotease activity is not needed for antirestriction function. We also observed by RNA-seq that ArdC-dependent conjugation triggers an SOS response in the P. putida recipient cells. Our findings give new insights, and open new questions, into the antirestriction strategies developed by plasmids to counteract bacterial restriction strategies.",

    "abstract": "Numerous ecological studies for myxobacteria have been conducted well, but their true diversity hidden in plain sight remains to be explored. To bridge this gap, we here implemented a comprehensive survey of diversity and distribution of myxobacteria by using 4997 publicly available 16S rRNA gene sequences ([&ge;]1200 bp) collected from several hundreds of sites across multiple countries and regions. In the study, the meta-16S rRNA gene phylogenetic reconstruction clearly revealed that these sequences were classified to 998 species, 445 genera, 58 families, and 20 suborders, highlighting a considerable taxonomic diversity of myxobacteria, the great majority of which belonged to new taxa. Most cultured myxobacteria including the well-described type strains were strongly inclined to locate on the shallow branches of the phylogenetic tree; on the contrary, the majority of uncultured myxobacteria the deep branches. The geographical analysis of sequences based on their environmental categories clearly demonstrated that myxobacteria showed a nearly cosmopolitan distribution, despite the presence of some habitat-specific taxa, especially at genus and species levels. Among all abundant suborders, members of Suborder_4, Suborder_15, and Suborder_17 were more widely distributed in marine environments, the remaining suborders preferred to reside in terrestrial ecosystems, particularly in soils, indicating a potential selectivity of geographical distribution. In conclusion, this study profiles a clear framework of diversity and distribution of the cosmopolitan myxobacteria and sheds light on the isolation of the uncultured myxobacteria.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEMyxobacteria are an attractive bacterial group ubiquitous in soil and aquatic environments. However, the biodiversity and ecological preferences of myxobacteria remain poorly understood across heterogeneous environments. We analyzed thousands of publicly available and high-quality 16S rRNA gene sequences of myxobacteria by using the phylogenetic reconstruction. The study presented an astonishing diversity than that expected from the previous studies. This study further demonstrated that the culturability of myxobacteria was perfectly comparable to its phylogeny in the phylogenetic tree. The geographical analysis clearly indicated that myxobacteria showed a nearly cosmopolitan distribution, while some taxa exhibited obvious preferences for specific environmental conditions. Together, our study provides novel insights into the diversity, distributions, and ecological preferences of of myxobacteria from diverse environments and lays the foundation for innovation of isolation techniques and the discovery of new secondary metabolites.",

    "abstract": "Ubiquitylation is a common post translational modification of eukaryotic proteins and in the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) overall ubiquitylation increases in the transition from intracellular schizont to extracellular merozoite stages in the asexual blood stage cycle. Here, we identify specific ubiquitylation sites of protein substrates in three intracellular parasite stages and extracellular merozoites; a total of 1464 sites in 546 proteins were identified (data available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD014998). 469 ubiquitylated proteins were identified in merozoites compared with only 160 in the preceding intracellular schizont stage, indicating a large increase in protein ubiquitylation associated with merozoite maturation. Following merozoite invasion of erythrocytes, few ubiquitylated proteins were detected in the first intracellular ring stage but as parasites matured through trophozoite to schizont stages the extent of ubiquitylation increased. We identified commonly used ubiquitylation motifs and groups of ubiquitylated proteins in specific areas of cellular function, for example merozoite pellicle proteins involved in erythrocyte invasion, exported proteins, and histones. To investigate the importance of ubiquitylation we screened ubiquitin pathway inhibitors in a parasite growth assay and identified the ubiquitin activating enzyme (UBA1 or E1) inhibitor MLN7243 (TAK-243) to be particularly effective. This small molecule was shown to be a potent inhibitor of recombinant PfUBA1, and a structural homology model of MLN7243 bound to the parasite enzyme highlights avenues for the development of P. falciparum specific inhibitors. We created a genetically modified parasite with a rapamycin-inducible functional deletion of uba1; addition of either MLN7243 or rapamycin to the recombinant parasite line resulted in the same phenotype, with parasite development blocked at the late schizont stage. These results indicate that the intracellular target of MLN7243 is UBA1, and this activity is essential for the final differentiation of schizonts to merozoites. The ubiquitylation of many merozoite proteins and their disappearance in ring stages are consistent with the idea that ubiquitylation leads to their destruction via the proteasome once their function is complete following invasion, which would allow amino acid recycling in the period prior to the parasites elaboration of a new food vacuole.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities are highly responsive to environmental cues, and both their structure and activity can be altered in response to changing conditions. We hypothesized that host-associated microbial communities, particularly those colonizing host surfaces, can serve as in situ sensors to reveal environmental conditions experienced by both microorganisms and the host. For a proof-of-concept, we studied a model plant-soil system and employed a non-deterministic gene-centric approach. A holistic analysis was performed using plants of two species and irrigation with water of low quality to induce host stress. Our analyses examined the genetic potential (DNA) and gene expression patterns (RNA) of plant-associated microbial communities, as well as transcriptional profiling of host plants. Transcriptional analysis of plants irrigated with treated wastewater revealed significant enrichment of general stress-associated root transcripts relative to plants irrigated with fresh water. Metagenomic analysis of root-associated microbial communities in treated wastewater-irrigated plants, however, revealed enrichment of more specific stress-associated genes relating to high levels of salt, high pH and lower levels of oxygen. Meta-analysis of these differentially abundant genes obtained from other metagenome studies provided evidence of the link between environmental factors such as pH and oxygen and these genes. Analysis of microbial transcriptional response demonstrated that enriched gene content was actively expressed, which implies contemporary response to elevated levels of pH and salt. We demonstrate here that microbial profiling can elucidate stress signals that cannot be observed even through interrogation of host transcriptome, leading to an alternate mechanism for evaluating in situ conditions experienced by host organisms.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThis study examines the potential for microbial communities to provide insight into stresses experienced by their eukaryotic host organisms, through profiling of metagenomes and metatranscriptomes. Our study uses plant host-associated microorganisms as an in vivo and in situ microsensor to identify environmental stresses experienced by the microbial community and by the plant. Transcriptionally active host-associated microbial communities are responsive in a highly specific manner to environmental conditions. Conversely, host transcriptome sequencing provides only a very general stress response. This study is a proof-of-concept for the use of microbial communities as microsensors, with a great potential for interrogation of a wide range of host systems.",

    "abstract": "The ter region of the bacterial chromosome, where replication terminates, is the last to be segregated before cell division in Escherichia coli. Delayed segregation is controlled by the MatP protein, which binds to specific sites (matS) within ter, and interacts with other proteins such as ZapB. Here, we investigate the role of MatP by combining short-time mobility analyses of the ter locus with biochemical approaches. We find that ter mobility is similar to that of a non-ter locus, except when sister ter loci are paired after replication. This effect depends on MatP, the persistence of catenanes, and ZapB. We characterise MatP/DNA complexes and conclude that MatP binds DNA as a tetramer, but bridging matS sites in a DNA-rich environment remains infrequent. We propose that tetramerisation of MatP links matS sites with ZapB and/or with non-specific DNA to promote optimal pairing of sister ter regions until cell division.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The mycomembrane layer of the mycobacterial cell envelope is a barrier to environmental, immune and antibiotic insults. We find that there is mycomembrane remodeling along the periphery of nutrient-starved, non-replicating mycobacterial cells. Remodeling is supported by recycling of trehalose, a non-mammalian disaccharide that shuttles long-chain mycolate lipids to the mycomembrane. In the absence of trehalose recycling, mycomembrane synthesis continues but mycobacteria experience ATP depletion, enhanced respiration and redox stress. Redox stress from depletion of the trehalose pool is suppressed in a mutant that lacks the OtsAB de novo trehalose synthesis pathway. Our data suggest that trehalose recycling alleviates the energetic burden of mycomembrane remodeling. Loss of trehalose salvage is known to attenuate M. tuberculosis during infection and render the bacterium more susceptible to a variety of drugs. Recycling pathways are emerging targets for sensitizing resource-limited bacterial pathogens to host and antibiotic stress.",

Integration of fluorescent dyes directly into the metabolic flux assay generates a more complete data set of mitochondrial features in a single assay.

    "abstract": "Social communication in most mammals is mediated by chemosignals, collected by active sniffing and detected mainly by the vomeronasal organ (VNO). In reptiles, however, chemosignals are delivered to the VNO through the oral cavity via the nasopalatine ducts (NPDs) - two direct passageways connecting the nasal and the oral cavities. While the structure of the NPDs is highly conserved across terrestrial vertebrate, it is unclear whether they retain any functional role in mammalian chemosignaling. Here we assess the role of the mouse NPDs in VNO function and associated behavioral responses. By reconstructing the 3D morphological architecture of the mouse snout using micro CT, we identify a net of micro-tunnels forming a direct passageway connecting the NPDs to the nasal cavity and the vomeronasal organ. We further demonstrate that physical obstruction of the NPDs destructs VNO clearance, and reduces chemosignaling-evoked neuronal activation in the medial amygdala. Obstruction of the NPDs also impaired the innate male preference for female chemosignals as well as social approach behavior, indicating the crucial role of the murine nasopalatine ducts in pheromone sensing.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEsters are versatile chemicals and potential drop-in biofuels. To develop a sustainable production platform, microbial ester biosynthesis using alcohol acetyltransferases (AATs) has been studied for decades. Volatility of esters endows thermophilic production with advantageous downstream product separation. However, due to the limited thermal stability of AATs known, the ester biosynthesis has largely relied on use of mesophilic microbes. Therefore, developing thermostable AATs is important for thermophilic ester production directly from lignocellulosic biomass by the thermophilic consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) microbes, e.g., Clostridium thermocellum.\\n\\nResultsIn this study, we engineered a thermostable chloramphenicol acetyltransferase from Staphylococcus aureus (CATSa) for enhanced isobutyl acetate production at elevated temperature. We first analyzed the broad alcohol substrate range of CATSa. Then, we targeted a highly conserved region in the binding pocket of CATSa for mutagenesis. The mutagenesis revealed that F97W significantly increased conversion of isobutanol to isobutyl acetate. Using CATSa F97W, we demonstrated the engineered C. thermocellum could produce isobutyl acetate directly from cellulose.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study highlights that CAT is a potential thermostable AAT that can be harnessed to develop the thermophilic CBP microbial platform for biosynthesis of designer bioesters directly from lignocellulosic biomass.",

    "abstract": "Rapid detection of antibiotic resistance using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) could improve clinical outcomes and limit the spread of resistance. For this to succeed, we need an accurate way of linking genotype to phenotype, that identifies new resistance mechanisms as they appear. To assess how close we are to this goal, we characterized antimicrobial resistance determinants in >4,000 Staphylococcus aureus genomes of isolates associated with bloodstream infection in the United Kingdom and Ireland. We sought to answer three questions: 1) how well did known resistance mechanisms explain phenotypic resistance in our collection, 2) how many previously identified resistance mechanisms appeared in our collection, and 3) how many of these were detectable using four contrasting genome-wide association study (GWAS) methods. Resistance prediction based on the detection of known resistance determinants was 98.8% accurate. We identified challenges in correcting for population structure, clustering orthologous genes, and identifying causal mechanisms in rare or common phenotypes, which reduced the recovery of known mechanisms. Limited sensitivity and specificity of these methods made prediction using GWAS-discovered hits alone less accurate than using literature-derived genetic determinants. However, GWAS methods identified novel mutations associated with resistance, including five mutations in rpsJ, which improved tetracycline resistance prediction for 28 isolates, and a T118I substitution in fusA which resulted in better fusidic acid resistance prediction for 5 isolates. Thus, GWAS approaches in conjunction with phenotypic testing data can support the development of comprehensive databases to enable real-time use of WGS for patient management.",

Recent work has successfully applied a method of deriving distributed vector representations from structured biomedical knowledge, known as Embedding of Semantic Predications (ESP), to the problem of predicting individual drug side effects. In the current paper we extend this work by applying ESP to the problem of predicting polypharmacy side-effects for particular drug combinations, building on a recent reconceptualization of this problem as a network of drug nodes connected by side effect edges. We evaluate ESP embeddings derived from the resulting graph on a side-effect prediction task against a previously reported graph convolutional neural network approach, using the same data and evaluation methods. We demonstrate that ESP models perform better, while being faster to train, more re-usable, and significantly simpler.",

In this work, we have employed a network interdiction model free of growth optimality assumptions, a special case of bilevel optimisation, for computational strain design and have developed a hybrid Benders algorithm (HBA) that deals with complicating binary variables in the model, thereby achieving high efficiency without numeric issues in search of best design strategies. More importantly, HBA can list solutions that meet users production requirements during the search, making it possible to obtain numerous design strategies at a small runtime overhead (typically[~] 1 hour).",

We also investigated the correlation of PD-L1 with the presence and degree of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in a subset of cases. IHC was performed using the PD-L1 SP263 companion kit (VENTANA) on tissue microarrays from an archival cohort. Evaluation of PD-L1 and TILs was performed on full sections for a subset of 23 cases. Fishers exact and Mann Whitney test were used to establish significance (P <0.05). PD-L1 positive expression ([&ge;]1%) was identified in 31% of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas, 29% of angiosarcomas, 26% of rhabdomyosarcomas, 18% of myxofibrosarcomas, 11% of leiomyosarcomas and 10% of dedifferentiated liposarcomas. Negative expression was present in all atypical lipomatous tumous/well-differentiated lipoasarcomas, myxoid liposarcomas, synovial sarcomas, pleomorphic liposarcomas, and Ewing sarcomas. PD-L1 IHC was concordant in 81% (38 of 47) of matched/paired samples. PD-L1 IHC was discordant in 19% (9 of 47 matched/paired samples), displaying differences in the proportion of cells expressing PD-L1 amongst paired samples with the percentage of PD-L1-positive cells increasing in the metastatic/recurrent site compared to the primary in 6 of 9 cases (67%). Significant correlation between PD-L1 expression and the degree of TILs was exclusively identified in the general cohort of leiomyosarcomas, but not in other sarcoma subtypes or in metastatic/recurrent samples. We conclude that the prevalence of PD-L1 expression in selected sarcomas is variable and likely to be clone dependent. Importantly, we demonstrated that PD-L1 can objectively increase in a small proportion of metastases/recurrent sarcomas, offering the potential of treatment benefit to immune checkpoint inhibitors in this metastatic setting.",

    "abstract": "Schistosomes are parasitic blood flukes that survive for many years within the mammalian host vasculature. How the parasites establish a chronic infection in the hostile bloodstream environment, whilst evading the host immune response is poorly understood. The parasite develops morphologically and grows as it migrates to its preferred vascular niche, avoiding or repairing damage from the host immune system. In this study, we investigated temporal changes in gene expression during the intra-mammalian development of Schistosoma mansoni. RNA-seq data were analysed from parasites developing in the lung through to egg-laying mature adult worms, providing a comprehensive picture of in vivo intra-mammalian development. Remarkably, genes involved in signalling pathways, developmental control, and adaptation to oxidative stress were up-regulated in the lung stage. The data also suggested a potential role in immune evasion for a previously uncharacterised gene. This study not only provides a large and comprehensive data resource for the research community, but also reveals new directions for further characterising host-parasite interactions that could ultimately lead to new control strategies for this neglected tropical disease pathogen.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe life cycle of the parasitic flatworm Schistosoma mansoni is split between snail and mammalian (often human) hosts. An infection can last for more than 10 years, during which time the parasite physically interacts with its mammalian host as it moves through the bloodstream, travelling through the lungs and liver, to eventually establish a chronic infection in the blood vessels around the host gut. Throughout this complex journey, the parasite develops from a relatively simple larval form into a more complex, sexually reproducing adult. To understand the molecular basis of parasite interactions with the host during this complex journey we have produced genome-wide expression data from developing parasites. The parasites were collected from experimentally-infected mice over its developmental time-course from the poorly studied lung stage, to the fully mature egg-laying adult worm. The data highlight many genes involved in processes known to be associated with key stages of the infection. In addition, the gene expression data provide a unique view of interactions between the parasite and the immune system in the lung, including novel players in host-parasite interactions. A detailed understanding of these processes may provide new opportunities to design intervention strategies, particularly those focussed on the early stages of the infection that are not targeted by current chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Null mice for the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) have been instrumental in understanding the function of this protein in the central nervous system. Several lines of D2R knockout mice have been generated, which share some characteristics but differ in others. The D2R functional knockout mouse, first described in 1997, is functionally null for D2R-mediated signaling but the Drd2 gene was interrupted at the most extreme distal end leaving open the question about whether transcript and protein are produced. We decided to determine if there are D2R transcripts, the characteristics of these transcripts and whether they are translated in the brain of D2R functional knockout mice. Sequence analysis of 3 Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends showed that D2R functional knockout mice express transcripts that lack only the exon eight. Immunofluorescence showed D2R-like protein in the brain of the knockout mice. As previously reported, D2R functional knockout mice are hypoactive and insensitive to the D2R agonist quinpirole (QNP). However, the heterozygous showed locomotor activity and response to QNP similar to the wild-type mice. Intriguingly, microdialysis experiments showed that heterozygous mice, such as knockouts, have half the normal levels of synaptic dopamine in the striatum. However, heterozygous mice responded similarly to wild-type mice to an acute injection of QNP, showing a 50% decrease in synaptic dopamine. In conclusion, D2R functional knockout mice express transcripts that lead to a truncated D2R protein that lacks from the sixth transmembrane domain to the C-terminal end but retains the third intracellular loop. We discuss the implications of this truncated D2R coexisting with the native D2R that may explain the unexpected outcomes observed in the heterozygous. Finally, we suggest that the D2R functional knockout mouse can be a useful model for studying protein-protein interaction and trafficking of D2R.",
