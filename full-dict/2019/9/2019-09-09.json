    "abstract": "Activity cascades are found in many complex systems. In the cortex, they arise in the form of neuronal avalanches that capture ongoing and evoked neuronal activities at many spatial and temporal scales. The scale-invariant nature of avalanches suggests that the brain is in a critical state, yet predictions from critical theory on the temporal unfolding of avalanches have yet to be confirmed in vivo. Here we show in awake nonhuman primates that the temporal profile of avalanches follows a symmetrical, inverted parabola spanning up to hundreds of milliseconds. This parabola constrains how avalanches initiate locally, extend spatially and shrink as they evolve in time. Importantly, parabolas of different durations can be collapsed with a scaling exponent close to 2 supporting critical generational models of neuronal avalanches. Spontaneously emerging, transient {gamma}-oscillations coexist with and modulate these avalanche parabolas thereby providing a temporal segmentation to inherently scale-invariant, critical dynamics. Our results identify avalanches and oscillations as dual principles in the temporal organization of brain activity.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe most common framework for understanding the temporal organization of brain activity is that of oscillations, or  brain waves. In oscillations, distinct physiological frequencies emerge at well-defined temporal scales, dividing brain activity into time segments underlying cortex function. Here, we identify a fundamentally different temporal parsing of activity in cortex. In awake Macaque monkeys, we demonstrate the motif of an inverted parabola that governs the temporal unfolding of brain activity in the form of neuronal avalanches. This symmetrical motif is scale-invariant, that is, it is not tied to time segments, and exhibits a scaling exponent close to 2, in line with prediction from theory of critical systems. We suggest that oscillations provide a transient regularity in an otherwise scale-invariant temporal organization pervading cortical activity at numerous scales.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is an intricate neuropsychiatric brain disorder characterized by social deficits and repetitive behaviors. Associated ASD biomarkers can be supportive of apprehending the underlying roots of the disease and lead the targeted diagnosis as well as treatment. Although deep learning approaches have been applied in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) based clinical or behavioral identification of ASD, most erstwhile models are inadequate in their capacity to exploit the data richness. Classification techniques often solely rely on region-based summary and/or functional connectivity analysis of one pipeline or unique site dataset. Besides these, biomedical data modeling to analyze big data related to ASD is still perplexing due to its complexity and heterogeneity. Single volume image consideration has not been previously investigated in classification purposes. By deeming these challenges, in this work, firstly, we design an image generator to generate single volume brain images from the whole-brain image of each subject. Secondly, the single volume images are analyzed by evaluating four deep learning approaches comprising one amended volume base Convolutional Neural Network framework to classify ASD and typical control participants. Thirdly, we propose a novel deep ensemble learning classifier using VGG16 as feature extractor to ensure further classification performance. Then, to evaluate the classifier performance across the inter sites, we apply the proposed method on each site individually and validate our findings by comparing literature reports. We showcase our approaches on large-scale multi-site brain imaging dataset (ABIDE) by considering four preprocessing pipelines, and the outcome demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance compared with the literature findings; hence, which are robust and consistent.",

    "abstract": "Mental imagery is the process through which we retrieve and recombine information from our memory to elicit the subjective impression of \"seeing with the minds eye\". In the social domain, we imagine other individuals while recalling our encounters with them or modelling alternative social interactions in future. Many studies using imaging and neurophysiological techniques have shown several similarities in brain activity between visual imagery and visual perception, and have identified frontoparietal, occipital and temporal neural components of visual imagery. However, the neural connectivity between these regions during visual imagery of socially relevant stimuli have not been studied. Here we used electroencephalography to investigate neural connectivity and its dynamics between frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal electrodes during visual imagery of faces. We found that voluntary visual imagery of faces is associated with long-range phase synchronisation in the gamma frequency range between frontoparietal electrode pairs and between occipitoparietal electrode pairs. In contrast, no effect of imagery was observed in the connectivity between occipitotemporal electrode pairs. Gamma range synchronisation between occipitoparietal electrode pairs predicted subjective ratings of the contour definition of imagined faces. Furthermore, we found that visual imagery of faces is associated with an increase of short-range frontal synchronisation in the theta frequency range, which temporally preceded the long-range increase in the gamma synchronisation. We speculate that the local frontal synchrony in the theta frequency range might be associated with an effortful top-down mnemonic reactivation of faces. In contrast, the long-range connectivity in the gamma frequency range along the fronto-parieto-occipital axis might be related to the endogenous binding and subjective clarity of facial visual features.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing the neural dynamics underlying sensory processing is one of the central areas of investigation in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Neuroimaging techniques such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) have provided significant insights into the neural processing of continuous stimuli, such as speech, thanks to their high temporal resolution. Existing work in the context of auditory processing suggests that certain features of speech, such as the acoustic envelope, can be used as reliable linear predictors of the neural response manifested in M/EEG. The corresponding linear filters are referred to as temporal response functions (TRFs). While the functional roles of specific components of the TRF are well-studied and linked to behavioral attributes such as attention, the cortical origins of the underlying neural processes are not as well understood. In this work, we address this issue by estimating a linear filter representation of cortical sources directly from neuroimaging data in the context of continuous speech processing. To this end, we introduce Neuro-Current Response Functions (NCRFs), a set of linear filters, spatially distributed throughout the cortex, that predict the cortical currents giving rise to the observed ongoing MEG (or EEG) data in response to continuous speech. NCRF estimation is cast within a Bayesian framework, which allows unification of the TRF and source estimation problems, and also facilitates the incorporation of prior information on the structural properties of the NCRFs. To generalize this analysis to M/EEG recordings which lack individual structural magnetic resonance (MR) scans, NCRFs are extended to free-orientation dipoles and a novel regularizing scheme is put forward to lessen reliance on fine-tuned coordinate co-registration. We present a fast estimation algorithm, which we refer to as the Champ-Lasso algorithm, by leveraging recent advances in optimization, and demonstrate its utility through application to simulated and experimentally recorded MEG data under auditory experiments. Our simulation studies reveal significant improvements over existing methods that typically operate in a two-stage fashion, in terms of spatial resolution, response function reconstruction, and recovering dipole orientations. The analysis of experimentally-recorded MEG data without MR scans corroborates existing findings, but also delineates the distinct cortical distribution of the underlying neural processes at high spatiotemporal resolution. In summary, we provide a principled modeling and estimation paradigm for MEG source analysis tailored to extracting the cortical origin of electrophysiological responses to continuous stimuli.",

    "abstract": "SSRIs are commonly used to treat pregnant women with depression. However, SSRIs can cross the placenta and affect the development of the fetus. The effects of perinatal SSRI exposure, and especially the effects on social behavior, are still incompletely documented. This study first aims to investigate whether rats show prosocial behavior in the form of consolation behavior. Secondly, it aims to investigate whether perinatal SSRI exposure affects this prosocial behavior. At last, we investigate whether the behavior changed after the rats had been exposed to an additional white-noise stressor.\n\nRat dams received 10 mg/kg/d fluoxetine (FLX) or vehicle (CTR) via oral gavage from gestational day 1 until postnatal day 21. At adulthood, the rat offspring were housed in four cohorts of 4 females and 4 males in a seminatural environment. As prosocial behaviors are more prominent after stressful situations, we investigated the behavioral response of rats immediately after natural aggressive encounters (fights). Additionally, we studied whether a stressful white-noise exposure would alter this response to the aggressive encounters.\n\nOur study indicates that CTR-female rats are able to show third party prosocial behavior in response to witnessing aggressive encounters between conspecifics in a seminatural environment. In addition, we showed that perinatal FLX exposure impairs the display of prosocial behavior in female rats. Moreover, we found no signs of prosocial behavior in CTR- and FLX-males after natural aggressive encounters. After white-noise exposure the effects in third party prosocial behavior of CTR-females ceased to exist. We conclude that female rats are able to show prosocial behavior, possibly in the form of consolation behavior. In addition, the negative effects of perinatal fluoxetine exposure on prosocial behavior could provide additional evidence that SSRI treatment during pregnancy could contribute to the risk for social impairments in the offspring.",

    "abstract": "The Ferric Iron Uptake (Fiu) transporter from Escherichia coli functions in the transport of iron-catecholate complexes across the bacterial outer membrane, providing the bacterium with iron which is an essential element for growth. Recently, it became clear that Fiu also represents a liability: its activity allows the import of antimicrobial compounds that have evolved to mimic catecholate. In this work we have determined the structure of Fiu and analyzed its function to address how Fiu and related transporters from other bacterial species can bind catecholate in a surface-exposed cavity. In addition, the crystal structure of Fiu reveals the presence of a large, selectively gated cavity in the interior of this transporter. This chamber is large enough to accommodate the Fiu substrate and may act to regulate substrate import. These data provide insight into the mechanism of substrate uptake by Fiu and related transporters identified in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. As Fiu and its homologues are the targets of substrate mimicking antibiotics, these data will assist in the development of antibiotics that target these receptors for cell entry.",

    "abstract": "Recent work on self-organized remodeling of vasculature in slime-mold, leaf venation systems and vessel systems in vertebrates has put forward a plethora of potential adaptation mechanisms. All these share the underlying hypothesis of a flow-driven machinery, meant to alter rudimentary vessel networks in order to optimize the systems dissipation, flow uniformity, or more, with different versions of constraints. Nevertheless, the influence of environmental factors on the long-term adaptation dynamics as well as the networks structure and function have not been fully understood. Therefore, interwoven capillary systems such as found in the liver, kidney and pancreas, present a novel challenge and key opportunity regarding the field of coupled distribution networks. We here present an advanced version of the discrete Hu-Cai model, coupling two spatial networks in 3D. We show that spatial coupling of two flow-adapting networks can control the onset of topological complexity in concert with short-term flow fluctuations. We find that both fluctuation-induced and spatial coupling induced topology transitions undergo curve collapse obeying simple functional rescaling. Further, our approach results in an alternative form of Murrays law, which incorporates local vessel interactions and flow interactions. This geometric law allows for the estimation of the model parameters in ideal Kirchhoff networks and respective experimentally acquired network skeletons.",

    "abstract": "vi.AimFossil pollen is an important tool for understanding biogeographic patterns in the past, but the taxonomic resolution of the fossil-pollen record may be limited to genus or even family level. Chemical analysis of pollen grains has the potential to increase the taxonomic resolution of pollen, but present-day chemical variability is poorly understood. This study aims to investigate whether a phylogenetic signal is present in the chemical variations of Quercus L. pollen and to assess the prospects of chemical techniques for identification in biogeographic research.\n\nLocationPortugal\n\nTaxonSix taxa (five species, one subspecies) of Quercus L., Q. faginea, Q. robur, Q. robur ssp. estremadurensis, Q. coccifera, Q. rotundifolia and Q. suber belonging to three sections: Cerris, Ilex, and Quercus (Denk, Grimm, Manos, Deng, & Hipp, 2017)\n\nMethodsWe collected pollen samples from 297 individual Quercus trees across a 4{degrees} ([~]450 km) latitudinal gradient and determined chemical differences using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). We used canonical powered partial least-squares regression (CPPLS) and discriminant analysis to describe within- and between-species chemical variability.\n\nResultsWe find clear differences in the FTIR spectra from Quercus pollen at the section level (Cerris: [~]98%; Ilex: [~]100%; Quercus: [~]97%). Successful discrimination is based on spectral signals related to lipids and sporopollenins. However, discrimination of species within individual Quercus sections is more difficult: overall, species recall is [~]76% and species misidentifications within sections lie between 18% and 31% of the test-set.\n\nMain ConclusionsOur results demonstrate that subgenus level differentiation of Quercus pollen is possible using FTIR methods, with successful classification at the section level. This indicates that operator-independent FTIR approaches can surpass traditional morphological techniques using the light microscope. Our results have implications both for providing new insights into past colonisation pathways of Quercus, and likewise for forecasting future responses to climate change. However, before FTIR techniques can be applied more broadly across palaeoecology and biogeography, our results also highlight a number of research challenges that still need to be addressed, including developing sporopollenin-specific taxonomic discriminators and determining a more complete understanding of the effects of environmental variation on pollen-chemical signatures in Quercus.",

    "abstract": "Recent technical advances combined with novel computational approaches promised the acceleration of our understanding of the tree of life. However, when it comes to hyperdiverse and poorly known groups of invertebrates, studies are still scarce. As published phylogenies will be rarely challenged by future taxonomists, careful attention must be paid to potential analytical bias. We present the first molecular phylogenetic hypothesis for the family Chalcididae, an emblematic group of parasitoid wasps, with a representative sampling (144 ingroups and 7 outgroups) that covers all described subfamilies and tribes and 82% of the known genera. Analyses of 538 Ultra-Conserved Elements (UCEs) with supermatrix (RAxML and IQTREE) and gene-tree reconciliation approaches (ASTRAL, ASTRID) resulted in highly supported topologies in overall agreement with morphology but reveal conflicting topologies for some of the deepest nodes. To resolve these conflicts, we explored the phylogenetic tree space with clustering and gene genealogy interrogation methods, analyzed marker and taxon properties that could bias inferences and performed a thorough morphological analysis (130 characters encoded for 40 taxa representative of the diversity). This joint analysis reveals that UCEs enable attainment of resolution between ancestry and convergent /divergent evolution when morphology is not informative enough, but also shows that a systematic exploration of bias with different analytical methods and a careful analysis of morphological features is required to prevent publication of artefactual results. We highlight a GC-content bias for ML approaches, an artefactual mid-point rooting of the ASTRAL tree and a deleterious effect of high percentage of missing data on gene tree reconciliation methods. Based on the results we propose a new classification of the family into eight subfamilies and 10 tribes that lay the foundation for future studies on the evolutionary history of Chalcididae.",

A common complication is that multiple disease states present with the same set of symptoms, and hence share the clinical diagnosis. Because 1) disease states might have distinct genetic bases; and 2) frequencies of the disease states within the clinical diagnosis vary by the environmental variables, analyses of association with the clinical diagnosis as an outcome variable might result in false positive or false negative findings. We develop estimates for assessment of GxE in a case-only study and compare the case-control and case-only estimates. We report extensive simulation studies that evaluate empirical properties of the estimates and show the application to a study of Alzheimers disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEpidemiological studies report evidence for an association between folate and the risk of several common cancers. However, both protective and harmful effects have been reported, and effects may differ by cancer site. Using Mendelian randomisation (MR), we investigated the causal relationships of genetically predicted serum folate with pan-cancer risk (all cancers excluding non-melanoma skin cancers); breast, prostate, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers; and malignant melanoma.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a two-sample MR analysis, using genetic instruments for serum folate to appraise the possible causal role on risk of pan-cancer and six site-specific cancers using summary statistics available from large consortia and the population-based cohort study UK Biobank (UKBB).\n\nResultsThere was little evidence that genetically elevated serum folate was causally associated with risk of pan-cancer or six site-specific cancers. Meta-analysis showed odds ratios (OR) per SD increase in log serum folate of 0.93 (95% CI 0.78-1.11) for breast cancer, 0.87 (95% CI 0.71-1.06) for prostate cancer, 0.84 (95% CI 0.59-1.20) for ovarian cancer, and 0.87 (95% CI 0.57-1.32) for lung cancer. The OR for colorectal cancer was 1.18 (95% CI 0.64-2.18) in large consortia analysis, while ORs for pan-cancers and malignant melanoma in UKBB were 0.88 (95% CI 0.73-1.06) and 0.56 (95% CI 0.29-1.08) respectively. The results were powered to detect modest effect sizes (>90% power ( 0.05) to detect ORs 1.2 (0.8) for the GWAS consortia) and were consistent between the two statistical approaches used (inverse variance weighted (IVW) and likelihood-based).\n\nConclusionsThere is little evidence that genetically elevated serum folate may affect the risk of pan-cancer and six site-specific cancers. However, we may still be underpowered to detect clinically relevant but smaller magnitude effects. Our results provide some evidence that increasing levels of circulating folate through widespread supplementation or deregulation of fortification of foods with folic acid is unlikely to lead to moderate unintended population-wide increase in cancer risk.\n\nKey MessagesO_LIObservational studies have identified associations between folate (both intake and circulating levels) and risk of developing site-specific cancers.

    "abstract": "Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) are instrumental in natural prokaryotic genome editing, permitting genome plasticity and allowing microbes to accumulate immense genetic diversity. MGEs include DNA elements such as plasmids, transposons and Insertion Sequences (IS-elements), as well as bacteriophages (phages), and they serve as a vast communal gene pool. These mobile DNA elements represent a human health risk as they can add new traits, such as antibiotic resistance or virulence, to a bacterial strain. Sequencing libraries targeting circular MGEs, referred to as mobilomes, allows the expansion of our current understanding of the mechanisms behind the mobility, prevalence and content of these elements. However, metamobilomes from bacterial communities are not studied to the same extent as metagenomics, partly because of methodological biases arising from multiple displacement amplification (MDA), often used in previous metamobilome publications. In this study, we show that MDA is detrimental to the detection of larger-sized plasmids if small plasmids are present by comparing the abundances of reads mapping to plasmids in a wastewater sample spiked with a mock community of selected plasmids with and without MDA. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to produce samples consisting almost exclusively of circular MGEs and obtain a catalog of larger, complete, circular MGEs from complex samples without the use of MDA.\\n\\nImportanceMobile genetic elements (MGEs) can transport genetic information between genomes in different bacterial species, adding new traits, potentially generating dangerous multidrug-resistant pathogens. In fact, plasmids and circular MGEs can encode bacterial genetic specializations such as virulence, resistance to metals, antimicrobial compounds, and bacteriophages, as well as the degradation of xenobiotics. For this reason, circular MGEs are crucial to investigate, but they are often missed in metagenomics and ecological studies. In this study, we present, for the first time, an improved method, which reduces the bias towards small MGEs and we demonstrate that this method can unveil larger, complete circular MGEs from complex samples without the use of multiple displacement amplification. This method may result in the detection of larger-sized plasmids that have hitherto remained unnoticed and therefore has the potential to reveal novel accessory genes, acting as possible targets in the development of preventive strategies directed at pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Rare copy number variants associated with increased risk for neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders (referred to as ND-CNVs) are characterized by heterogeneous phenotypes thought to share a considerable degree of overlap. Altered neural integration has often been linked to psychopathology and is a candidate marker for potential convergent mechanisms through which ND-CNVs modify risk; however, the rarity of ND-CNVs means that few studies have assessed their neural correlates. Here, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate resting-state oscillatory connectivity in a cohort of 42 adults with ND-CNVs, including deletions or duplications at 22q11.2, 15q11.2, 15q13.3, 16p11.2, 17q12, 1q21.1, 3q29, and 2p16.3, and 42 controls. We observed decreased connectivity between occipital, temporal and parietal areas in participants with ND-CNVs. This pattern was common across genotypes and not exclusively characteristic of 22q11.2 deletions, which were present in a third of our cohort. Furthermore, a data-driven graph theory framework enabled us to successfully distinguish participants with ND-CNVs from unaffected controls using differences in node centrality and network segregation. Together, our results point to alterations in electrophysiological connectivity as a putative common mechanism through which genetic factors confer increased risk for neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "As a severe lethal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) usually originates from chronic liver injury and inflammation, in which the discovery of key genes is important for HCC prevention. Here, we analyzed the time serial (from 0 week to 30 weeks) transcriptome data of liver injury samples in diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC mouse model. Through expression and function analyses, we identified that Cyp2c29 was a key gene continuously downregulated during liver injury. Overexpression of Cyp2c29 suppressed the NF-{kappa}B activation, proinflammatory cytokine production and hepatocyte proliferation by increasing its production 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (14,15-EET). Furthermore, in vivo Cyp2c29 protected against liver inflammation in liver injury mice models by reversing the expression on functions of cell proliferation, metabolism and inflammation including suppressing NF-{kappa}B pathway and compensatory proliferation. CYP2C8 and CYP2C9, two human homologs of mouse Cyp2c29, were decreased in human HCC progression and positively correlated with HCC patient survival. Therefore, through systematical analysis and verification, we identified that Cyp2c29 is a novel gene in liver injury and inflammation, which may be a potential biomarker for HCC prevention and prognosis.",

    "abstract": "The signal delay during the propagation of action potentials is one of the key issues in understanding the mechanisms of generation and propagation of neural signals. Here we reanalyzed related experimental data to demonstrate that action potentials in the propagation process along a myelinated axon are highly overlapped in the time scale. The shift in time of two successive signals from neighboring nodes, defined as delay time{tau} in this work, is only tens of microseconds (16.3-87.0 s), thus is only ~ 0.8-4.4 % of the measured average duration of an action potential, ~ 2 ms. This fact may reveal a huge gap to the commonly accepted picture for propagation of neural signal. We could apply the electromagnetic soliton-like model to well explain this phenomenon, and attribute{tau} to the waiting time that one signal source (i.e., ion channel cluster at one node) needs to take when it generates an electromagnetic neural pulse with increasing intensity until the intensity is higher than a certain point so as to activate neighboring signal source. This viewpoint may shed some light on a better understanding of the exact physical mechanism of neural signal communication in a variety of biosystems.\\n\\nStatement of SignificanceThe delay time during the propagation of action potentials is an important term in understanding the mechanisms of generation and propagation of neural signals. In this article we analyzed published experimental data and showed that action potentials from two neighboring Ranvier nodes are highly overlapped in time, with an average shift of tens of microseconds, which occupied only ~ 0.8-4.4 % of the average duration of an action potential (2 ms). The electromagnetic soliton-model seemed the best model to explain this phenomenon.\\n\\nThe viewpoint of this article may shed some light on a better understanding of the exact physical mechanism of neural signal communication, and be tractive to researchers in a variety of fields, such as neuroscience, brain-computer interface, etc..",

It is especially relevant for conservation and management of indigenous fishes in western North America, represented herein by two species with dissimilar life-histories co-distributed in the highly modified Colorado River (i.e., Flannelmouth Sucker, Catostomus latipinnis; Bluehead Sucker, C. Pantosteus discobolus). To quantify phylogenomic patterns and examine proposed taxonomic revisions, we first employed double-digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD), yielding 39,755 unlinked SNPs across 139 samples. These were subsequently evaluated with multiple analytical approaches and by contrasting life history data. Three phylogenetic methods and a Bayesian assignment test highlighted similar phylogenomic patterns in each, but with considerable difference in presumed times of divergence. Three lineages were detected in Bluehead Sucker, supporting elevation of C. P. virescens to species-status, and recognizing C. P. discobolus yarrowi (Zuni Bluehead Sucker) as a discrete entity. Admixture in the latter necessitated a reevaluation of its contemporary and historic distributions, underscoring how biodiversity identification can be confounded by complex evolutionary histories. In addition, we defined three separate Flannelmouth Sucker lineages as ESUs (Evolutionarily Significant Units), given limited phenotypic and genetic differentiation, contemporary isolation, and lack of concordance (per the genealogical concordance component of the phylogenetic species concept). Introgression was diagnosed in both species, with the Little Colorado and Virgin rivers in particular. Our diagnostic methods, and the alignment of our SNPs with previous morphological, enzymatic, and mitochondrial work, allowed us to partition complex evolutionary histories into requisite components, such as isolation versus secondary contact.",

This novel bare-part coloration offers a unique opportunity to understand how leg and bill coloration evolve in birds. To identify the causative locus, we resequenced the genome of urucum canaries and performed a range of analyses to search for genotype-to-phenotype associations across the genome. We identified a nonsynonymous mutation in the gene BCO2 (beta-carotene oxygenase 2, also known as BCDO2), an enzyme involved in the cleavage and breakdown of full-length carotenoids into short apocarotenoids. Protein structural models and in vitro functional assays indicate that the urucum mutation abrogates the carotenoid cleavage activity of BCO2. Consistent with the predicted loss of carotenoid cleavage activity, urucum canaries had increased levels of full-length carotenoid pigments in bill tissue and a significant reduction in levels of carotenoid cleavage products (apocarotenoids) in retinal tissue compared to other breeds of canaries. We hypothesize that carotenoid-based bare-part coloration might be readily gained, modified, or lost through simple switches in the enzymatic activity or regulation of BCO2 and this gene may be an important mediator in the evolution of bare-part coloration among bird species.",

    "abstract": "Loss of function of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) in human Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and in model organisms results in phenotypes of abnormal neuronal structure and dynamics, synaptic function and connectivity which may contribute to a state of neuronal, circuit and organism hyperexcitability. Previous in vivo identification of FMRP association with specific mRNA targets in mouse brain revealed that FMRP regulates the translation of a large fraction of the synaptic proteome in both pre- and post-synaptic compartments as well as many transcription factors and chromatin modifying proteins. However, it was not previously possible to determine the ratio of FMRP binding to transcript abundance due to the complexity of different neuronal cell types in whole brain. Moreover, it has been difficult to link the translational regulation of specific targets to model phenotypes or human symptoms. For example, loss-of-function of FMRP in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum results in three cell autonomous phenotypes related to learning and memory, including enhanced mGluR-LTD at parallel fiber synapses, altered dendritic spines and behavioral deficits in a eyeblink-conditioning learning paradigm shared by human FXS patients. The molecular basis for these and related human Fragile X phenotypes is unknown. To address these critical issues we have developed a new mouse model (the Fmr1 cTAG mouse) in which endogenous FMRP can be conditionally tagged for RNA:protein crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) identification of the RNAs with which it interacts in vivo. We used the Fmr1 cTAG mouse to quantitatively evaluate FMRP-mRNA association in Purkinje and cerebellar granule neurons which together comprise the parallel-fiber synapse. We calculated a stoichiometrically ranked list of FMRP RNA binding events by normalizing to ribosome-associated transcript abundance determined by TRAP-seq, and now definitively find that FMRP associates with specific sets of mRNAs which differ between the two cell types. In Purkinje cells, many components of the mGluR signaling pathway are FMRP targets including the top-ranked Purkinje cell mRNA Itpr1, encoding the IP3 receptor, the function of which is critical to proper mGluR-dependent synaptic plasticity. In sum, this novel approach provides the first ranked list of FMRP target mRNAs and further reveals that FMRP regulates a specific set of long neural genes related to relevant cell autonomous phenotypes.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIWe have created a mouse model in which endogenous FMRP can be conditionally tagged.\\nC_LIO_LIUsing tag-specific CLIP we describe ranked and specific sets of in vivo FMRP mRNA targets in two types of neurons.\\nC_LIO_LIThis ranking was used to reveal that FMRP regulates mRNAs with long coding sequences.\\nC_LIO_LIFMRP mRNA targets in Purkinje cells, including the top-ranked IP3 receptor, are related to cell-autonomous Fragile X phenotypes.\\nC_LIO_LIWe have updated our previous list of whole mouse brain FMRP mRNA targets with more replicates, deeper sequencing and improved analysis\\nC_LIO_LIThe use of tagged FMRP in less abundant cell populations allowed identification of novel mRNA targets missed in a whole brain analysis\\nC_LI",

The canonical short-term regulation mechanisms are receptor desensitization and degradation of the response. Here for the first time a pharmacological model for measuring drug parameters is developed that incorporates short-term mechanisms of regulation of signaling. The model is formulated in a manner that enables measurement of drug parameters using familiar curve fitting methods. The efficacy parameter is k{tau}, which is simply the initial rate of signaling before it becomes limited by regulation mechanisms. The regulation parameters are rate constants, kDES for receptor desensitization and kD for response degradation. Efficacy and regulation are separate parameters, meaning these properties can be optimized independently of one another in drug discovery. The parameters can be applied to translate in vitro findings to in vivo efficacy in terms of the magnitude and duration of drug effect. When the time course data conform to certain shapes, for example the association exponential curve, a mechanism-agnostic approach can be applied to estimate agonist efficacy, without the need to know the underlying regulatory mechanisms. The model was verified by comparison with historical data and by fitting these data to estimate the model parameters. This new model for quantifying drug activity can be broadly applied to the short-term cell signaling assays used routinely in drug discovery and to aid their translation to in vivo efficacy, facilitating the development of new therapeutics.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIRegulation of signaling impacts measurement of drug effect\\nC_LIO_LIReceptor desensitization is incorporated here into a kinetic model of signaling\\nC_LIO_LIDrug effect and signaling regulation can now be measured independently\\nC_LIO_LIThe analysis framework is designed for signaling assays used in drug discovery\\nC_LIO_LIThese new analysis capabilities will aid development of new therapeutics\\nC_LI",

We added four Indian rice accessions to it and made original panel of 3004 accessions. However, large set of germplasms are difficult to preserve and evaluate. Construction of core and mini-core collections is an efficient method for managing genetic resources. This study aims to designing of mini-core comprised of 520 accessions representing original panel. The designed mini-core captured most of the SNPs and represented all phenotypes and geographical regions. The mini-core was validated using different statistical analyses and had representation from all major groups including japonica, indica, aus/boro and aromatic/basmati. GWAS analyses with mini-core panel efficiently reproduced the marker-traits association identified among original 3004 panel. Expression analysis of trait-associated genes highlights the relevance of such mini-core panel. Haplotype analysis could also validate our mini-core panel. Apart from mini-core, we identified few regional and varietal specific marker-trait associations which were not evident in original panel. In this era of large-scale sequencing projects, such a strategy of designing mini-core will be very useful.\\n\\nOne-sentence summaryDesigning of mini-core as manageable association panel that efficiently mirroring the large and diverse collection of 3004 rice accessions.",

    "abstract": "Golden redfish (Sebastes norvegicus) are a long-living (>50 years), late maturing (>10 years) species of commercial interest, distributed along the coast, shelves and continental slope of Norway, down to approximately 400 m depth in the water column. In recent years, analyses of size-at-age data have revealed variable growth trajectories for this species. Whilst some individuals appear to grow slowly after sexual maturity (37cm at ~ 15 years), others continue to grow throughout their lifetime up to 100 cm or more. To investigate how depth and latitude affect golden redfish growth patterns, we developed non-linear mixed effects statistical models. Alongside this, small scale experiments were also conducted to assess the quality of age-determination. The results showed that individuals found in deeper, northern waters present a higher growth potential, even when uncertainty in age determination and species identification were considered. The proximal causes for variations in the growth potential of S. norvegicus are still unresolved and the existence of a possible cryptic species remains a fundamental issue that will need to be addressed, in order to understand the causes behind observed growth variations.",

Here we demonstrate that combining sequence-based phylogenetic methods with structural information assists in making such mechanistic interpretations on a genomic scale. Our integrative analysis shows that positively selected sites tend to co-localise on protein structures and that positively selected clusters are found in functionally important regions of proteins, indicating that positive selection can contravene the well-known principle of evolutionary conservation of functionally important regions. This unexpected finding, along with our discovery that positive selection acts on structural clusters, opens new strategies for the development of better models of protein evolution. Remarkably, proteins where we detect the strongest evidence of clustering belong to just two functional groups: components of immune response and metabolic enzymes. This gives a coherent picture of immune response and xenobiotic metabolism as the drivers of adaptive evolution of mammals.",

    "abstract": "We present Nubeam (nucleotide be a matrix) as a novel reference-free approach to analyze short sequencing reads. Nubeam represents nucleotides by matrices, transforms a read into a product of matrices, and based on which assigns numbers to reads. Nubeam capitalizes on the non-commutative property of matrix multiplication, such that different reads are assigned different numbers, and similar reads similar numbers. A sample, which is a collection of reads, becomes a collection of numbers that form an empirical distribution. We demonstrate that the genetic difference between samples can be quantified by the distance between empirical distributions. Nubeam can account for GC bias and nucleotide quality, and is computationally efficient; the K-mer method is a special case of Nubeam, but without those benefits. As a reference-free approach, Nubeam avoids reference bias and mapping bias and can work with organisms without reference genomes. Thus, Nubeam is ideal to analyze datasets from metagenomic whole-genome sequencing, where the amount of unmapped reads is substantial. When applied to human microbiome sequencing, Nubeam recapitulated findings made by mapping-based methods, and shed lights on contributions of unmapped reads. In particular, body habitats dominate clustering of unmapped pseudo-samples; there are more outliers in skin whole samples than the skin mapped pseudo-samples; and analysis of unmapped reads suggested that the sequencing depth is far from sufficient for urogenital samples.",

Moreover, declared components can be present in false proportions, since expensive taxa might be exchanged for cheaper ones. We have previously reported that PCR-free metagenomic sequencing of total DNA extracted from sausage samples combined with bioinformatic analysis (termed All-Food-Seq, AFS), can be a valuable screening tool to identify the taxon composition of food ingredients. Here we illustrate this principle by analysing regional Doner kebap samples, which revealed unexpected and unlabelled poultry and plant components in three of five cases. In addition, we systematically apply AFS to a broad set of reference meat material of known composition (i.e. reference sausages) to evaluate quantification accuracy and potential limitations. We include a detailed analysis of the effect of different food matrices and the possibility of false-positive sequence read assignment to closely related species, and we compare AFS quantification results to quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). AFS emerges as a potent PCR-free screening tool, which can detect multiple target species of different kingdoms of life within a single assay. Mathematical calibration accounting for pronounced matrix effects can significantly improves AFS quantification accuracy. In comparison, AFS performs better than classical qPCR, and is on par with ddPCR.",

    "abstract": "The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a cellular homeostatic circuit regulating protein synthesis and processing in the ER by three ER-to-nucleus signaling pathways. One pathway is triggered by the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), which splices the X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA, thereby enabling expression of XBP1s. Another UPR pathway activates the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). Here we show that murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), a prototypic {beta}-herpesvirus, harnesses the UPR to regulate its own life cycle. MCMV activates the IRE1-XBP1 pathway early post infection to relieve repression by XBP1u, the product of the unspliced XBP1 mRNA. XBP1u inhibits viral gene expression and replication by blocking the activation of the viral major immediate-early promoter by XBP1s and ATF6. These findings reveal a redundant function of XBP1s and ATF6 as activators of the viral life cycle, and an unexpected role of XBP1u as a potent repressor of both XBP1s and ATF6-mediated activation.",

Additionally, the blue pigment co-existence in specific Bouligand structure is proved for the green crab Carcinus aestuarii, although the crab does not appear blue.

    "abstract": "The Banana Bunchy Top Virus (BBTV) is one of the most economically important vector-borne banana diseases throughout the Asia-Pacific Basin and presents a significant challenge to the agricultural sector. Current models of BBTV are largely deterministic, limited by an incomplete understanding of interactions in complex natural systems, and the appropriate identification of parameters. A stochastic network-based Susceptible-Infected model has been created which simulates the spread of BBTV across the subsections of a banana plantation, parameterising nodal recovery, neighbouring and distant infectivity across summer and winter. Findings from posterior results achieved through Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to approximate Bayesian computation suggest seasonality in all parameters, which are influenced by correlated changes in inspection accuracy, temperatures and aphid activity. This paper demonstrates how the model may be used for monitoring and forecasting of various disease management strategies to support policy-level decision making.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe Banana Bunchy Top Virus (BBTV) poses one of the greatest threats to the food security of developing nations and the banana industry throughout the Asia-Pacific Basin. Decision-makers face significant challenges in mitigating BBTV spread in banana plantations due to the vector-borne spread of this disease, which is significantly influenced by a vast array of external environmental factors that are unique to each plantation.\\n\\nWe propose a flexible network-based model that describes the spread of BBTV in a real banana plantation through a random process while accounting for individual plantation characteristics and utilise a principled methodology for estimating model parameters. Our findings quantify the effect of seasonal changes and plantation configuration on BBTV spread and predict for high-risk areas in this plantation. We believe that our model might be used by decision-makers to evaluate the effectiveness of current disease management strategies and explore opportunities for improvements.",

Experimental MI was induced in wild-type (WT) and eosinophil-depleted mice ({Delta}dblGATA or anti-Siglec F antibody treated). Cardiac function was characterised by high-resolution ultrasound and immune cell infiltration by flow cytometry of infarct digests.\\n\\nResultsBlood eosinophil count declined in the hours following STEMI in patients and following MI induction in mice. Eosinophils were subsequently identified in the myocardium of patients and mice. Genetic eosinophil depletion in mice increased LV dilatation (end-systolic area: 29.0{+/-}2.2cm2 v 21.6{+/-}1.6cm2; p=0.02) and reduced ejection fraction (22.0{+/-}3.6% v 34.3{+/-}4.0% in p=0.04,) in {Delta}dblGATA v WT following MI (n=8-9/group), an outcome reproduced by pharmacological depletion. {Delta}dblGATA mice had increased scar size with disrupted collagen deposition and altered expression of the collagen cross-linking genes plod2 and lox.

    "abstract": "Antibody-antigen binding relies on the specific interaction of amino acids at the paratope-epitope interface. The predictability of antibody-antigen binding is a prerequisite for de novo antibody and (neo-)epitope design. A fundamental premise for the predictability of antibody-antigen binding is the existence of paratope-epitope interaction motifs that are universally shared among antibody-antigen structures. In the largest set of non-redundant antibody-antigen structures, we identified structural interaction motifs, which together compose a commonly shared structure-based vocabulary of paratope-epitope interactions. We show that this vocabulary enables the machine learnability of antibody-antigen binding on the paratope-epitope level using generative machine learning. The vocabulary (i) is compact, less than 104 motifs, (ii) distinct from non-immune protein-protein interactions, and (iii) mediates specific oligo- and polyreactive interactions between paratope-epitope pairs. Our work successfully leveraged combined structure- and sequence-based learning showing that machine-learning-driven predictive paratope and epitope engineering is feasible.",

    "abstract": "Multiband (MB) or Simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) acquisition schemes allow the acquisition of MRI signals from more than one spatial coordinate at a time. Commercial availability has brought this technique within the reach of many neuroscientists and psychologists. Most early evaluation of the performance of MB acquisition employed resting state fMRI or the most basic tasks. In this study, we tested whether the advantages of using MB acquisition schemes generalize to group analyses using a cognitive task more representative of typical cognitive neuroscience applications. Twenty-three subjects were scanned on a Philips 3T scanner using five sequences up to eight-fold acceleration with MB-factors 1 to 4, SENSE factors up to 2 and corresponding TRs of 2.45s down to 0.63s, while they viewed (i) movies showing complex actions with hand object interactions and (ii) control movies without hand object interaction. Using random effects group-level, voxel-wise analysis we found that all sequences were able to detect the basic action observation network known to be recruited by our task. The highest t-values were found for sequences with MB4 acceleration. For the MB1 sequence, a 50% bigger voxel volume was needed to reach comparable t-statistics. The group-level t-values for resting state networks (RSNs) were also highest for MB4 sequences. Here the MB1 sequence with larger voxel size did not perform comparable to the MB4 sequence. Altogether, we can thus recommend the use of MB4 (and SENSE 1.5 or 2) on a Philips scanner when aiming to perform group-level analyses using cognitive block design fMRI tasks and voxel sizes in the range of cortical thickness (e.g. 2.7mm isotropic). While results will not be dramatically changed by the use of multiband, our results suggest that MB will bring a moderate but significant benefit.",

    "abstract": "Gene pairs resulting from whole genome duplication (WGD), so-called ohnologous genes, are retained only if at least one gene of the pair undergoes neo- or subfunctionalization. Sequence-based phylogenetic analyses of the ohnologous genes ALBOSTRIANS (HvAST/HvCMF7) and ALBOSTRIANS-LIKE (HvASL/HvCMF3) of barley (Hordeum vulgare) revealed that they belong to a newly identified subfamily of genes encoding CCT domain proteins with putative N-terminal chloroplast transit peptides. Recently, we showed that HvCMF7 is needed for chloroplast ribosome biogenesis. Here we demonstrate that mutations in HvCMF3 lead to seedlings delayed in development. They exhibit a xantha phenotype and successively develop pale green leaves. Compared to the wild type, plastids of the mutant seedlings show decreased PSII efficiency and lower amounts of ribosomal RNAs; they contain less thylakoids and grana with a higher number of more loosely stacked thylakoid membranes. Site-directed mutagenesis of HvCMF3 identified a previously unknown functional region, which is highly conserved within this subfamily of CCT domain containing proteins. HvCMF3:GFP fusion constructs localized to plastids. Hvcmf3Hvcmf7 double mutants indicated epistatic activity of HvCMF7 over HvCMF3. The chloroplast ribosome deficiency is discussed as the primary defect of the Hvcmf3 mutants. Our data suggests that HvCMF3 and HvCMF7 have similar but not identical functions.\\n\\nOne-sentence summaryPhylogenetic and mutant analyses of the barley protein HvCMF3 (ALBOSTRIANS-LIKE) identified, in higher plants, a subfamily of CCT domain proteins with essential function in chloroplast development.",

    "abstract": "The role of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons degeneration is well established in the pathophysiology of Parkinsons disease. However, it is unclear if and how the degeneration of the dopamine pathways affects the manifestation of the neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of Parkinsons disease (PD). Dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging, a technique to measure the reduction in the dopamine transporters is increasingly used as a tool in the diagnosis of PD. In this study, we examine if the baseline dopamine transporter density in the striatum measured by striatal binding ratio (SBR) is associated with the longitudinal onset and/or progression of NPS in PD as measured by the part 1 of Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale, over four years. Data of patients with PD and an abnormal screening present on 123I-ioflupane single-proton emission computed tomography were obtained from Parkinsons Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database. Latent Growth Modeling (LGM), a statistical technique that can model the change over time while considering the variability in rate of change at the individual level was used to examine the progression of NPS over time. The results indicate the SBR did not correlate with the baseline NPS but did correlate with the rate of change of NPS (p<0.001) over the next four years, even after eliminating age related variance which can be a significant confounding factor. In conclusion, this study showed gradual worsening in NPS in patients with Parkinsons disease which inversely correlates with the density of the dopamine transporters as measured by SBR at baseline.",

Previously, we have reported that the absence of WDR13 in diabetic Leprdb/db mice helps in amelioration of fatty liver phenotype along with diabetes and systemic inflammation. This intrigued us to study direct liver injury and hepatic regeneration in Wdr13-/0 mice using hepatotoxin CCl4.\\n\\nMethodsMice were injected with CCl4 twice a week for 8 consecutive weeks.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe needs of people diagnosed with Mental Neurological and Substance-Use (MNS) conditions are complex including interactions physical, social, medical and environmental factors. Treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach including health and social services at different levels of care. However, due to inadequate assessment, services and scarcity of human resource for mental health, treatment of persons diagnosed with MNS conditions in many LMICs is mainly facility-based pharmacotherapy with minimal non-pharmacology treatments and social support services. In low resource settings, gaps in human resource capacity may be met using layperson health workers. A layperson health working is one without formal mental health training and may be equivalent to community health worker (CHW) or less cadre in primary health care system.\\n\\nObjectivesThis study reviewed layperson mental health screening tools for use in supporting mental health in developing countries, including the content and psychometric properties of the tools. Based on this review this study proposes recommendations for the design and effective use of layperson mental health screening tools based on the Five Pillars of global mental health.\\n\\nMethodsA systematic review was used to identify and examine the use of mental health screening tools among laypersons supporting community-based mental health programs. PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL and PsychInfo databases were reviewed using a comprehensive list of keywords and MESH terms that included mental health, screening tools, lay-person, lower and middle income countries. Articles were included if they describe mental health screening tools used by laypersons for screening, delivery or monitoring of MNS conditions in community-based program in LMICs. Diagnostic tools were not included in this study. Trained research interviewers or research assistants were not considered as lay health workers for this study.\\n\\nResultsThere were eleven studies retained after 633 were screened. Twelve tools were identified covering specific disorders (E.g. alcohol and substance use, subcortical dementia associated with HIV/AIDS, PTSD) or common mental disorders (mainly depression and anxiety). These tools have been tested in LMICs including South Africa, Zimbabwe, Haiti, Malaysia, Pakistan, India, Ethiopia and Brazil. The included studies show that simple screening tools can enhance the value of laypersons and better support their roles in providing community-based mental health support. However, most of the layperson MH screening tools used in LMICs do not provide comprehensive information that can inform integrated comprehensive treatment planning and understanding of the broader mental health needs of the community.\\n\\nConclusionDeveloping a layperson screening tools is vital for integrated community-based mental health intervention. This study proposed a holistic framework which considers the relationship between individuals physical, mental and spiritual aspect of mental health, interpersonal as well as broader contextual determinants (community, policy and different level of the health system) that can be consulted for developing or selecting a layperson mental health screening instrument. More research are needed to evaluate the practical application of this framework.",

    "abstract": "All living systems acquire information about their environment. At the cellular level, they do so through signaling pathways, which rely on interactions between molecules that detect and transmit the presence of an extracellular cue or signal to the cells interior. Such interactions are inherently stochastic and thus noisy. In classical information theory, a noisy communication channel degrades the amount of transmissible information relative to a noise-free channel. For this reason, one would expect that the kinetic parameters that determine a pathways operation minimize noise. We show that this is not the case under a wide range of biologically sensible parameter values. Specifically, we perform computational simulations of simple signaling systems, which show that a noisy molecular interaction dynamics is a necessary condition for information acquisition. Moreover, we show that optimal information acquisition, where a system reacts most sensitively to changes in the environment, can be obtained close to the maximal attainable level of noise in the system. Our work highlights the positive role that noise can have in biological information processing.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe acquisition of information is fundamental for living systems, because the decisions they take based on such information directly affect survival and reproduction. The molecular mechanisms used by cells to acquire information are signaling pathways. The molecular interactions of signaling pathways, such as the binding of a signal to a receptor, are by nature noisy. This is important, because noise disrupts information. Hence, to maximize the acquisition of information, signaling pathways should minimize the noise of their molecular interactions. Here we show that a noisy dynamic of the molecular interactions can improve the acquisition of information, and that the maximal capacity to acquire information can be obtained with a close-to-maximal level of noise in a signaling pathway. Thus, contrary to expectations, noise can improve the acquisition of information in living systems.",

    "abstract": "Amblyomma americanum ticks transmit more than a third of human tick-borne disease (TBD) agents in the United States. Tick saliva proteins are critical to success of ticks as vectors of TBD agents, and thus might serve as targets in tick antigen-based vaccines to prevent TBD infections. We describe a systems biology approach to identify, by LC-MS/MS, saliva proteins (tick=1182, rabbit=335) that A. americanum ticks likely inject into the host every 24 h during the first 8 days of feeding, and towards the end of feeding using two different sample preparation approaches (in-gel and in-solution). The in-gel approach determined molecular identification of predominant protein bands in tick saliva, and the in-solution added depth to discovery of proteins. Searching against entries in GenBank grouped tick and rabbit proteins in this study into 27 and 25 functional categories. Aside from housekeeping-like proteins, majority of tick saliva proteins belong to the tick-specific (no homology to non-tick organisms: 32%), protease inhibitors (13%), proteases (8%), glycine-rich proteins (6%) and lipocalins (4%) categories. Global secretion dynamics analysis suggests that majority (74%) of proteins in this study are associated with regulating initial tick feeding functions and transmission of pathogens as they are secreted within 24-48 h of tick attachment. Comparative analysis of the A. americanum tick saliva proteome to five other tick saliva proteomes identified 284 conserved tick saliva proteins: we speculate that these regulate critical tick feeding functions and might serve as tick vaccine antigens. We discuss our findings in the context of understanding A. americanum tick feeding physiology as a means through which we can find effective targets for a vaccine against tick feeding.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum, is a medically important species in US that transmits 5 of the 16 reported tick-borne disease agents. Most recently, bites of this tick were associated with red meat allergies in humans. Vaccination of animals against tick feeding has been shown to be a sustainable and effective alternative to current acaricide based tick control method which has several limitations. The pre-requisite to tick vaccine development is to understand the molecular basis of tick feeding physiology. Toward this goal, this study has identified proteins that A. americanum ticks inject into the host at different phases of its feeding cycle. This data set has identified proteins that A. americanum inject into the host within 24-48 h of feeding before it starts to transmit pathogens. Of high importance, we identified 284 proteins that are present in saliva of other tick species, which we suspect regulate important role(s) in tick feeding success and might represent rich source target antigens for a tick vaccine. Overall, this study provides a foundation to understand the molecular mechanisms regulating tick feeding physiology.",

    "abstract": "We developed an integrated R library called BWGS to enable easy computation of Genomic Estimates of Breeding values (GEBV) for genomic selection. BWGS relies on existing R-libraries, all freely available from CRAN servers. The two main functions enable to run 1) replicated random cross validations within a training set of genotyped and phenotyped lines and 2) GEBV prediction, for a set of genotyped-only lines. Options are available for 1) missing data imputation, 2) markers and training set selection and 3) genomic prediction with 15 different methods, either parametric or semi-parametric.\\n\\nThe usefulness and efficiency of BWGS are illustrated using a population of wheat lines from a real breeding programme. Adjusted yield data from historical trials (highly unbalanced design) were used for testing the options of BWGS. On the whole, 760 candidate lines with adjusted phenotypes and genotypes for 47 839 robust SNP were used. With a simple desktop computer, we obtained results which compared with previously published results on wheat genomic selection. As predicted by the theory, factors that are most influencing predictive ability, for a given trait of moderate heritability, are the size of the training population and a minimum number of markers for capturing every QTL information. Missing data up to 40%, if randomly distributed, do not degrade predictive ability once imputed, and up to 80% randomly distributed missing data are still acceptable once imputed with Expectation-Maximization method of package rrBLUP. It is worth noticing that selecting markers that are most associated to the trait do improve predictive ability, compared with the whole set of markers, but only when marker selection is made on the whole population. When marker selection is made only on the sampled training set, this advantage nearly disappeared, since it was clearly due to overfitting. Few differences are observed between the 15 prediction models with this dataset. Although non-parametric methods that are supposed to capture non-additive effects have slightly better predictive accuracy, differences remain small. Finally, the GEBV from the 15 prediction models are all highly correlated to each other. These results are encouraging for an efficient use of genomic selection in applied breeding programmes and BWGS is a simple and powerful toolbox to apply in breeding programmes or training activities.",

Based on the gene-for-gene theory, nine major rust resistance genes (SH1-9) have been proposed. However, these genes have not been characterized at the molecular level. Consequently, the lack of molecular data regarding rust resistance genes or candidates is a major bottleneck in coffee breeding. To address this issue, we screened a BAC library with resistance gene analogs (RGAs), identified RGAs, characterized and explored for any SH related candidate genes. Herein, we report the identification and characterization of a gene (gene 11), which shares conserved sequences with other SH genes and displays a characteristic polymorphic allele conferring different resistance phenotypes. Furthermore, comparative analysis of the two RGAs belonging to CC-NBS-LRR revealed more intense diversifying selection in tomato and grape genomes than in coffee. For the first time, the present study has unveiled novel insights into the molecular nature of the SH genes, thereby opening new avenues for coffee rust resistance molecular breeding.

    "abstract": "Currently, Diabetes and the associated Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) instances are increasing at an alarming rate. Numerous previous research has focused on automated DR detection from fundus photography. The classification of severe cases of pathological indications in the eye has achieved over 90% accuracy. Still, the mild cases are challenging to detect due to CNN inability to identify the subtle features, discrimnative of disease. The data used (i.e. annotated fundus photographies) was obtained from 2 publicly available sources - Messidor and Kaggle. The experiments were conducted with 13 Convolutional Neural Networks architectures, pre-trained on large-scale ImageNet database using the concept of Transfer Learning. Several performance improvement techniques were applied, such as: (i) fine-tuning, (ii) data augmentation, and (iii) volume increase. The results were measured against the standard Accuracy metric on the testing dataset. After the extensive experimentation, the maximum Accuracy of 86% on No DR/Mild DR classification task was obtained for ResNet50 model with fine-tuning (un-freeze and re-train the layers from 100 onwards), and RMSProp Optimiser trained on the combined Messidor + Kaggle (aug) datasets. Despite promising results, Deep learning continues to be an empirical approach that requires extensive experimentation in order to arrive at the most optimal solution. The comprehensive evaluation of numerous CNN architectures was conducted in order to facilitate an early DR detection. Furthermore, several performance improvement techniques were assessed to address the CNN limitation in subtle eye lesions identification. The model also included various levels of image quality (low/high resolution, under/over-exposure, out-of-focus etc.), in order to prove its robustness and ability to adapt to real-world conditions.",

    "abstract": "Because cancer evolution underlies the therapeutic difficulties of cancer, it is clinically important to understand the evolutionary dynamics of cancer. Thus far, a number of evolutionary processes have been proposed to be working in cancer evolution. However, there exists no simulation model that can describe the different evolutionary processes in a unified manner. In this study, we constructed a unified simulation model for describing the different evolutionary processes and performed sensitivity analysis on the model to determine the conditions in which cancer growth is driven by each of the different evolutionary processes. Our sensitivity analysis has successfully provided a series of novel insights into the evolutionary dynamics of cancer. For example, we found that, while a high neutral mutation rate shapes neutral intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) characterized by a fractal-like pattern, a stem cell hierarchy can also contribute to shaping neutral ITH by apparently increasing the mutation rate. Although It has been reported that the evolutionary principle shaping ITH shifts from selection to accumulation of neutral mutations during colorectal tumorigenesis, our simulation revealed the possibility that this evolutionary shift is triggered by drastic evolutionary events that occur in a a short time and confer a marked fitness increase on one or a few cells. This result helps us understand that each process works not separately but simultaneously and continuously as a series of phases of cancer evolution. Collectively, this study serves as a basis to understand in greater depth the diversity of cancer evolution.",

Despite the available treatments, some patients present late in the course of the disease when treatment is more difficult.

In this study, we constructed the DR animal model and the high model in HRMEC cell to investigate the relationship between ASK1/p38 and NLRP3 in DR. The results showed that DR could cause the inflammatory response and microvascular proliferation. NLRP3 contributed to DR-mediated inflammatory development and progression, which promoted the inflammatory related cytokine expression. Meanwhile, it could promote the tube formation of retinal microvascular endothelial and angiogenesis. Moreover, further research showed that NLRP3 mediated aberrant retinal angiogenesis in diabetic retinopathy was regulated by ASK1 and p38. It suggested that ASK1/p38 could become a new target in DR treatment.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDengue is an important mosquito-borne viral disease in tropical and sub-tropical countries. In this study molecular characterization was carried out to determine dengue viruses circulating among patients at health facilities during 2019 epidemic in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.\\n\\nMethodsThe study involved outpatients seeking care for febrile illness at four health facilities in Kinondoni and Ilala Districts of Dar es Salaam City in Tanzania. A total of 45 sera from the outpatients were confirmed dengue-positive for dengue virus (DENV) non-structural protein 1 (NS1) antigen and/or NS1-IgG/IgM antibodies using on-site rapid test. The presence of the virus was detected by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. Of the 45 sera, 20 samples were selected randomly for identification of specific dengue virus serotypes using RT-PCR followed by evaluation of resulting amplicons on agarose gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nFindings and significanceBoth Dengue virus serotypes 1 (DENV-1) and 3 (DENV-3) were detected in the samples tested with the former being dominant. We present the first evidence of dengue virus co-infection of DENV-1 and DENV-3 serotypes in Tanzania. The emergence of DENV-1 indicates the possibility of importation of the virus to Tanzania from endemic countries. Due to DENV serotype co-circulation, there is an increased risk of severe dengue in future epidemics. Our findings advocate the importance of genomic-based surveillance to provide rapid evidence of dengue virus emergence/re-emergence and spread.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryDengue viruses are the most important mosquito-borne pathogens that pose a serious global health threat. Tanzania has reported several dengue virus epidemics since 2010 with the majority of the epidemics occurring in Dar-es-Salaam city. Until August 2019, a total of 6,859 dengue cases have been confirmed in the country. We performed molecular characterization of dengue viruses (DENV) circulating during the 2019 epidemic phase. It was found that DENV-1 serotype was dominant during the epidemic and two samples of the tested sera were co-infected by DENV-1 and DENV-3 serotypes. These findings emphasize the importance of genomic-based surveillance of dengue viruses in Tanzania to guide strategies for appropriate interventions.",

    "abstract": "Alterations in protein folding may lead to aggregation of misfolded proteins, which is strongly correlated with neurotoxicity and cell death. Protein aggregation has been shown as a normal consequence of aging, but it is largely associated with age-related disease, particularly neurodegenerative diseases like Huntington disease (HD). Huntington disease is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene and serves as a useful model for neurodegeneration due to its strictly genetic origin. Research in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans suggests that glucose protects against cell stress, including proteotoxicity related to aggregation, despite the well-known, lifespan-shortening effects of glucose. We hypothesized that glucose could be beneficial by alleviating energy deficiency, a well-characterized phenomenon in HD, or by upregulating stress resistance pathways. We used C. elegans expressing polyglutamine repeats to quantify lifespan, motility, reproduction, learning, and activity of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), with and without glucose, to identify the role of glucose in proteotoxicity and neuroprotection. Our data show HD worms on glucose plates exhibited shorter lifespans, no change in motility, learning, or SDH product formation, but had altered reproductive phenotypes similar to dietary restriction. Additionally, worms expressing toxic polyglutamine repeats were unable to learn association of food with a neutral odorant. We also observed tissue-specific differences; polyglutamine appeared to be slightly more toxic to muscle cells than neurons. Rather than increasing energy production, glucose appeared to decrease mitochondrial metabolism, as SDH formation decreases with added glucose. Future work investigating glucose-mediated neuroprotection should focus on connecting metabolism, sirtuin activation, and DAF-16 activation.",

Seven days before wound induction, low dose simvastatin was orally administered to the DM+SIM and DM+MSCs+SIM groups. Eleven weeks after the induction of diabetes, all mice were given bilateral full-thickness excisional back skin wounds.\\n\\nResultsBy comparing the DM+MSCs+SIM and DM+MSCs groups, the results showed that on day 14; the wound closure (%WC) and capillary vascularity (%CV) in the DM+MSCs+SIM group were significantly increased compared to those in the DM+MSCs group. In addition, by using immunohistochemical techniques, it was also shown that the expression of SDF-1, a chemotactic factor regulating the migration of stem cells, in the DM+SIM+MSCs group was increased compared with that in the DM+MSCs group. Furthermore, using phospho-Akt (S473) Pan Specific DuoSet IC ELISA (R&D Systems, USA) kits, the increased tissue Akt levels were found in the DM+SIM+MSCs group but not in the other groups.\\n\\nConclusionsOur study suggests that a low dose of simvastatin enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs in diabetic wound healing, and this effect was associated with increases in pAkt levels, SDF-1 levels, and angiogenesis, and improved wound closure.",

    "abstract": "The diversity in baobab was studied on 75 trees located at Adaklu District and Ho and Hohoe Municipalities. Thirteen morphological traits were used in the characterisation based on Bioversity descriptors for baobab. GenStat edition 12 was used to analyse the diversity as well as germination and growth data. Group average hierarchical clustering with Jaccard similarity coefficient discriminated among most of the baobab trees. Clustering was not based on location although few trees that were not discriminated were from the same communities. The clustering can be used in selecting trees for further studies and domestication. Germination tests were conducted with soaked, boiled and sulphuric acid treated seeds. Only the sulphuric acid treated seeds had germination significantly higher than the control. More studies should be done to find easier way of breaking seed dormancy of baobab. There were significant differences in 100 seed weight, seed length and thickness among seeds from three different trees. However, there were no significant difference in seed width of the same sample. Seed size traits should be considered in selecting baobab for domestication because of the high variability revealed. Observation on seedling growth revealed less than 10 leaves in the first month and increased to about 20 in the fourth month. Growth in girth was 5mm and 8mm in the first and fourth months respectively. Seedling height of 17cm in the first month reached 40cm in four months. Information from this research is valuable for further work on domestication of baobab.",

Addressing the musculoskeletal health complaints (MHCs) among full-time employees has not been fully explored. The current study investigates the association between RTDs-related factors and MHCs among bank employees.\\n\\nMethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study among full-time employees from 32 banks in Dhaka city. Descriptive statistics summarized the gaps in the socio-demographic and RTDs-related factors on the one-month prevalence of MHCs. Random intercept logistic regression models were used to identify the associate factors of the MHCs.\\n\\nResultsOut of 628 full-time bank employees, the one-month prevalence of MHCs was 57.7%. The MHCs are more prevalent among adults of age group 40-60 years (68%) than the age group 20-40 years (54%). The one-month prevalence of lower back pain (LBP) was highest (36.6%), followed by neck pain (22.9%) and upper back pain (21.2%). Multilevel logistic regression analysis of employees showed that the odds of MHCs were lower among male employees (AOR=0.42, 95% CI= 0.27, 0.64), car commuters (AOR = 0.38, 95% CI=0.19-0.76, reference: bus commuters) and rickshaw commuters (AOR=. = 0.39, 95% CI=0.22-0.69, reference: bus commuters). The MHCs were significantly higher among employees with following factors: obesity (AOR= 1.50, 95% CI= 1.02-2.21), prolonged commute time to the office (AOR = 7.48, 95% CI =3.64-15.38) and working extended-time in a day (AOR= 1.50, 95% CI= 1.02-2.21).\\n\\nConclusionsThe study indicates a high burden of musculoskeletal health complaints among the employees in Dhaka city, and the most prevalent complaint was low back pain.

    "abstract": "Denned polar bears are invisible under the snow, therefore winter-time petroleum exploration and development activities in northern Alaska have potential to disturb maternal polar bears and their cubs. Previous research determined forward looking infrared (FLIR) imagery could detect many polar bear maternal dens under the snow, but also identified limitations of FLIR imagery. We evaluated the efficacy of FLIR-surveys conducted by oil-field operators from 2004-2016. Aerial FLIR surveys detected 15 of 33 (45%) and missed 18 (55%) of the dens known to be within surveyed areas. While greater adherence to previously recommended protocols may improve FLIR detection rates, the physical characteristics of polar bear maternal dens, increasing frequencies of weather unsuitable for FLIR detections--caused by global warming, and competing \\\"hot spots\\\" are likely to prevent FLIR surveys from detecting maternal dens reliably enough to afford protections consonant with increasing global threats to polar bear welfare.",

    "abstract": "Five out of six people receive at least one antibiotic prescription per year. However, the ever-expanding use of antibiotics in medicine, agriculture, and food production has accelerated the evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which, in turn, made the development of novel antibiotics based on new molecular targets a priority in medicinal chemistry. One way of possibly combatting resistant bacterial infections is by inhibiting the copper transporters in prokaryotic cells. Copper is a key element within all living cells, but it can be toxic in excess. Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells have developed distinct copper regulation systems to prevent its toxicity. Therefore, selectively targeting the prokaryotic copper regulation system might be an initial step in developing next-generation antibiotics. One such system is the Gram-negative bacterial CusCFBA efflux system. CusB is a key protein in this system and was previously reported to play an important role in opening the channel for efflux via significant structural changes upon copper binding while also controlling the assembly and disassembly process of the entire channel. In this study, we aimed to develop novel peptide copper channel blockers, designed by in silico calculations based on the structure of CusB. Using a combination of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and various biochemical methods, we found a lead peptide that promotes copper-induced cell toxicity. Targeting copper transport in bacteria has not yet been pursued as an antibiotic mechanism of action. Thus, our study lays the foundation for discovering novel antibiotics.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryHerein, we apply a novel approach for the development of a new generation of antibiotics based on copper toxicity. In cells, copper ions are double-edge swords. On the one hand, various enzymes depend on them as cofactors for catalysis, but on the other hand, they are highly toxic. Thus, cells have developed sophisticated regulation systems to very precisely control copper concentration. Prokaryotic organisms are more sensitive to copper than eukaryotic systems, and therefore they employ additional copper transporters that have no homology in the eukaryotic cells in general and specifically in the human cell. Here, we suggest to take advantage of this fact, by developing inhibitors against one of the bacterial copper transporter: CusCBA. The adaptor protein within this transporter, CusB, plays a critical role in the opening of the whole transporter. We designed a peptide that interfere with its proper function and assembly, and therefore inhibits the opening of the transporter upon copper stress. This study lays the foundation for designing better and novel antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "Warm fresh water is a natural habitat for many single-celled organisms, including protozoan parasites such as the infamous brain-eating amoeba, Naegleria fowleri, which can become pathogenic for mammals, including humans. The condition caused by N. fowleri is known as primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, which is a generic and usually fatal infection of the brain with rapid onset. One of the important factors influencing a wide spectrum of pathogens, including N. fowleri, is the bioavailability of iron in the environment. The strategy of withholding iron evolved in mammalian hosts, and the different strategies of pathogens to obtain it are an important part of host-parasite interactions.\\n\\nIn the present study, we employ different biochemical and analytical methods to explore the effect of decreased iron availability on the cellular processes of N. fowleri. We show that under iron starvation, nonessential, iron-dependent, mostly cytosolic pathways in N. fowleri are downregulated, while the metal is utilized in the mitochondria to maintain vital respiratory processes. Surprisingly, N. fowleri fails to respond to acute shortages of iron by the induction of a reductive iron uptake system that seems to be the main iron-obtaining strategy of the parasite. Our work aims to demonstrate the importance of mitochondrial iron in the biology of N. fowleri and to explore the plausibility of exploiting it as a potential target for therapeutic interference.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryNaegleria fowleri is undoubtedly one of the deadliest parasites of humans, hence the name \\\"brain-eating amoeba\\\". Being dangerous, but rare, it may be regarded as a highly understudied pathogen of humans. Unfortunately, the symptoms of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis may be confused with much more common bacterial meningoencephalitis; therefore, it is quite probable that many infections caused by N. fowleri have been misdiagnosed as bacterial infections without further inquiry. In many cases, fast diagnosis is vital for commencing the correct therapy, and even then, complete success of the treatment is very rare. Our laboratory focuses on the uptake and intracellular metabolism of metals in unicellular eukaryotes, so we decided to explore the biology of N. fowleri from this aspect. Changes in the proteome, as a direct effect of iron-deficient conditions, were described, and these data were used to further explore the ways in which N. fowleri responds to these conditions on a cellular level and how its biology changes. Based on these findings, we propose that the struggle of N. fowleri to obtain iron from its host could be exploited for therapeutic interference purposes in primary amoebic meningoencephalitis patients.",

In this work, we considered 1411 wine isolates from 21 countries that were genotyped using twelve microsatellite markers. We confirmed that B. bruxellensis isolates from wine environments show high genetic diversity, with 58 and 42% of triploid and diploid individuals respectively distributed in 5 main genetic groups. The distribution in the genetic groups varied greatly depending on the country and/or the wine-producing region. However, the two wine triploid groups showing sulfite resistance/tolerance were identified in almost all regions/countries. Genetically identical isolates were also identified. The analysis of these clone groups revealed that a given genotype could be isolated repeatedly in the same winery over decades, demonstrating unsuspected remanence ability. Besides cellar residency, a great geographic dispersal was also evidenced, with some genotypes isolated in wines from different continents. Finally, the study of old isolates and/or isolates from old vintages revealed that only the diploid groups were identified prior 1990 vintages. The triploid groups were identified in subsequent vintages, and their proportion has increased steadily these last decades, suggesting adaptation to winemaking practices such as sulfite use.

    "abstract": "The importance of geographic location and annual variation on the detection of differences in the rhizomicrobiome caused by the genetic modification of maize (Bt-maize, event MON810) was evaluated at experimental field sites across Europe including Sweden, Denmark, Slovakia and Spain. DNA of the rhizomicrobiome was collected at the maize flowering stage in three consecutive years and analyzed for the abundance and diversity of PCR-amplified structural genes of Bacteria, Archaea and Fungi, and functional genes for bacterial nitrite reductases (nirS, nirK). The nirK genes were always more abundant than nirS. Maize MON810 did not significantly alter the abundance of any microbial genetic marker, except for sporadically detected differences at individual sites and years. In contrast, annual variation between sites was often significant and variable depending on the targeted markers. Distinct, site-specific microbial communities were detected but the sites in Denmark and Sweden were similar to each other. A significant effect of the genetic modification of the plant on the community structure in the rhizosphere was detected among the nirK denitrifiers at the Slovakian site in only one year. However, most nirK sequences with opposite response were from the same or related source organisms suggesting that the transient differences in community structure did not translate to the functional level. Our results show a lack of effect of the genetic modification of maize on the rhizosphere microbiome that would be stable and consistent over multiple years. This demonstrates the importance of considering annual variability in assessing environmental effects of genetically modified crops.",

    "abstract": "We have designed a simple, inexpensive system for the studying the response of soil microbes to fire. This system allows one to create post-fire environments in soil in reproducible and realistic ways. Using it we show that the peak soil temperature achieved at a given depth occurs hours after the fire is out, lingers near peak temperature for a significant time, and is accurately predicted by the log of soil depth and the mass charcoal burned. Flash fuels that left no large coals were found to have a negligible soil heating effect. Coupling this system with Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the control and post-fire soil we show that we can stimulate a rapid, massive response by Pyronema, a well-known genus of postfire fungus, from uninoculated forest soil within two weeks of a test fire. This specific stimulation occurs in a background of many other fungal taxa that do not change significantly with the fire, although there is an overall reduction in richness and evenness. Extrapolating from the physical relationships we predict soil heating effects in wild fires are likely to be very patchy across the forest floor but the width of a survivable \\\"goldilocks zone\\\" will stay relatively constant across a range of fuel loads. We further predict that a necromass zone above it, which represents an open niche for pyrophilous microbes, increases in size rapidly with addition of fuel, and then remains nearly constant over a broad range of fuel loads. The simplicity of this experimental system, coupled with the availability of a set of sequenced, assembled and annotated genomes of pyrophilous fungi, offers a powerful tool for dissecting the ecology of post-fire microbial communities.",

The pooled sensitivities and specificities were 0.93 and 0.97 for the ELISA test. For the reference test (DID and/or CIE), these values were 0.64 and 0.99. Analyses of summary receiver operating characteristic curves yielded 0.99 for ELISA and 0.99 for the reference test (DID and/or CIE). Our meta-analysis suggests that the diagnostic accuracy of ELISA is greater than that of the reference tests (DID and/or CIE) in early detection of CPA.",

    "abstract": "The Old World cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera was first detected in Brazil with subsequent reports from Paraguay, Argentina, Bolivia, and Uruguay. This pattern suggests that the H. armigera spread across the South American continent following incursions into northern/central Brazil, however, this hypothesis has not been tested. Here we compare northern and central Brazilian H. armigera mtDNA COI haplotypes with those from southern Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, and Paraguay. We infer spatial genetic and gene flow patterns of this dispersive pest in the agricultural landscape of South America. We show that the spatial distribution of H. armigera mtDNA haplotypes and its inferred gene flow patterns in the southwestern region of South America exhibited signatures inconsistent with a single incursion hypothesis. Simulations on spatial distribution patterns show that the detection of rare and/or the absence of dominant mtDNA haplotypes in southern H. armigera populations are inconsistent with genetic signatures observed in northern and central Brazil. Incursions of H. armigera into the New World are therefore likely to have involved independent events in northern/central Brazil, and southern Brazil/Uruguay-Argentina-Paraguay. This study demonstrates the significant biosecurity challenges facing the South American continent, and highlights alternate pathways for introductions of alien species into the New World.",
