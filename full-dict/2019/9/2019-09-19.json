    "abstract": "Diet and environment profoundly modulate lifespan. We measured longevity as a function of diet and weight gain across a genetically diverse family of mice. We followed 1348 females from two parental strains--C57BL/6J and DBA/2J--and 146 cohorts of BXD isogenic progeny strains (n = 73) across their lifespan on a low fat chow diet (CD, 18% calories from fat) and on a high fat diet (HFD, 60% calories from fat). On average, HFD shortens lifespan by 85 days or 12%, roughly equivalent to an 8-10 year decrease in humans. However, strain variation in the response of diet on longevity is remarkably high, ranging from a longevity loss of 54% in BXD65 to a gain of 37% in BXD8. Baseline weights and early weight gain are both associated with a mean decrease in longevity of [~]4 days/g. By 500 days-of-age, cases fed HFD gained four times as much weight as control on average. However, strain-specific variation was substantial, thus weight gain did not correlate well with lifespan. In summary, high fat had a strong negative effect on longevity, but genetic interactions effects were even stronger. This highlights the unequivocal importance of genetic differences in making dietary recommendations.",

    "abstract": "In this study, part of a research project on Chagas disease among residents of Bolivia in Sao Paulo, we describe socioeconomic characteristics, knowledge about the disease and access to health services. A structured questionnaire was applied to a sample of 472 Bolivian adults (> 18 years) living in Sao Paulo enrolled in the Barra Funda School Health Center. The median age of participants was 28.5 years, 75.0% from the Bolivian department of La Paz, who were living in Sao Paulo for an average of 5.8 years. Regarding knowledge about the disease and exposure to certain risk factors, 47.7% indicated familiarity with the vector, 23.9% had seen vinchuca in their homes in Bolivia and 6.4% reported having been bitten by a triatomine. The conditions of living in rural areas in Bolivia or in other department than La Paz, have a relative with illness, high school graduation and have seen or been bitten by a vinchuca were significantly associated with the knowledge of the vector. This study provides a view on migration that has important implications for the distribution of Chagas disease and access to health care by providing subsidies for proposing public health policies.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThis article expresses part of the results of a research project called \\\"Chagas disease in a population of Bolivian immigrants in Sao Paulo: an analysis of the prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection and morbidity of Chagas disease, knowledge of the population about the disease and access to different levels of health care\\\". The problem of chronic Chagas disease occurs in many countries, including those not considered endemic, as a result of population movements, mainly by immigration due to urbanization which has led to its globalization. It is now considered an emerging disease with significant potential for transmission via blood transfusions, organ transplants and congenital via, in the absence of appropriate strategies in terms of public health, as well as reactivation of chronic disease in urban centers. Its no different this phenomenon to the city of Sao Paulo. This study analyzed the sociodemographic inserts, labor, migration and knowledge about Chagas disease and its impact on personal, family and professional life of Bolivian immigrants living in Sao Paulo.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the gating mechanism of ion channel proteins is key to understanding the regulation of cell signaling through these channels. Channel opening and closing are regulated by diverse environmental factors that include temperature, electrical voltage across the channel, and proton concentration. Low permeability in voltage-gated potassium ion channels (Kv) is intimately correlated with the prolonged action potential duration observed in many acidosis diseases. The Kv channels consist of voltage-sensing domains (S1-S4 helices) and central pore domains (S5-S6 helices) that include a selectivity filter and water-filled cavity. The voltage-sensing domain is responsible for the voltage-gating of Kv channels. While the low permeability of Kv channels to potassium ion is highly correlated with the cellular proton concentration, it is unclear how an intracellular acidic condition drives their closure, which may indicate an additional pH-dependent gating mechanism of the Kv family. Here, we show that two residues E327 and H418 in the proximity of the water cavity of Kv1.2 play crucial roles as a pH switch. In addition, we present a structural and molecular concept of the pH-dependent gating of Kv1.2 in atomic detail, showing that the protonation of E327 and H418 disrupts the electrostatic balance around the S6 helices, which leads to a straightening transition in the shape of their axes and causes dewetting of the water-filled cavity and closure of the channel. Our work offers a conceptual advancement to the regulation of the pH-dependent gating of various voltage-gated ion channels and their related biological functions.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe acid sensing ion channels are a biological machinery for maintaining the cell functional under the acidic or basic cellular environment. Understanding the pH-dependent gating mechanism of such channels provides the structural insight to design the molecular strategy in regulating the acidosis. Here, we studied the voltage-gated potassium ion channel Kv1.2 which senses not only the electrical voltage across the channels but also the cellular acidity. We uncovered that two key residues E327 and H418 in the pore domain of Kv1.2 channel play a role as pH-switch in that their protonation control the gating of the pore in Kv1.2 channel. It offered a molecular insight how the acidity reduces the ion permeability in voltage-gated potassium channels.",

The species specific activities of different cyanobacterial species as well as the N- and C-exchange of associated heterotrophic bacteria in these processes, however, are widely unknown. Within one time series experiment we tested the cycling in a natural, late stage cyanobacterial bloom by adding 13C bi-carbonate and 15N2, and performed sampling after 10 min, 30 min, 1 h, 6 h and 24 h in order to determine the fixing species as well as the fate of the fixed carbon and nitrogen in the associations. Uptake of 15N and 13C isotopes by the most abundant cyanobacterial species as well as the most abundant associated heterotrophic bacterial groups was then analysed with a NanoSIMS. Overall, the filamentous, heterocystous species Dolichospermum sp., Nodularia sp., and Aphanizomenon sp. revealed no or erratic uptake of carbon and nitrogen, indicating mostly inactive cells. In contrary, non-heterocystous Pseudanabaena sp. dominated the nitrogen and carbon fixation, with uptake rates up to 1.49 {+/-} 0.47 nmol N h-1 l-1 and 2.55 {+/-} 0.91 nmol C h-1 l-1. Associated heterotrophic bacteria dominated the subsequent nitrogen cycling with uptake rates up to 1.2 {+/-} 1.93 fmol N h-1 cell -1, but were also indicative for fixation of di-nitrogen.",

    "abstract": "Objectivesgiven the scarcity of data regarding prevalence of various infectious diseases in Latin-American countries, our study aims to assess the burden of T.cruzi, S.stercoralis, HIV and viral hepatitis in Latin-American migrants, with a focus on Bolivian migrants.\\n\\nMethodswe performed a retrospective observational study of 565 screening evaluations on adults ([&ge;] 18 years) carried out at our referral International Healthcare service in Barcelona. We reviewed structured clinical records and microbiological results of patients attended between February 2012 and April 2015.\\n\\nResultsthe median 35 years old and 74% were women. Bolivian origin accounted for 87% of the screened population. We found a 48% prevalence of T.cruzi, 16% of S.stercoralis, 0.2% of HIV, 92% of HAV, 0.2% HBV and 0.2% HCV.\\n\\nConclusionsthese results support the relevance of the screening of T. cruzi and S. stercoralis in Bolivian migrants, but challenge the pertinence of systematic screening of HBV in this population.\\n\\nAuthor summaryIn response to the challenge of detecting diseases not previously present in host countries, screening programs have been implemented for migrants based on the probability of having certain diseases depending on their country of origin and / or migratory route. This increased risk is very clearly established in some cases such as Trypanosoma cruzi infection (the cause of Chagas disease) in people from Latin America; especially from Bolivia. In recent years screening recommendations for Strongyloides stercoralis in this population was proven necessary. Current recommendations regarding systematic screening for hepatitis B establish the relevance of screening based on the probability of the disease in the 2% population of origin. Since there are no reliable and up to date data regarding prevalence of hepatitis B virus in Bolivia, we aimed to analyze data available for migrants from Bolivia in Spain.\\n\\nOur results support the importance of screening for T. cruzi and S.stercoralis in patients from Bolivia. However, our data show a much lower prevalence of this hepatitis B virus (0.2%) than the 2% threshold that would justify systematic screening, so we question the relevance of screening for hepatitis B virus in this population in the absence of other risk factors.",

    "abstract": "Systolic and diastolic blood pressures are reported as single point values by the non-invasive techniques used in clinical practice, while, in fact, they are highly varying signals. The objective of this study was to document the magnitude of variation of systolic and diastolic pressures over a few minutes by analysing intra-arterial pressure recordings made in 51 haemodynamically stable patients in an intensive care unit. Intra-arterial pressure data were acquired by a validated data acquisition system. Fast-Flush test was performed and the dynamic characteristics of the catheter transducer system namely natural frequency and damping co-efficient were calculated. Only those recordings with acceptable dynamic characteristics were included in the analysis. Power spectral calculation using the Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the pressure recording revealed two frequency peaks below the peak at heart rate. The lower and higher frequency peaks below the heart rate peak are referred to as Mayer and Traube waves in this study. Mayer wave peaks were observed in DFT spectra of 49 out of 51 patients. The Mayer wave frequency peaks ranged between 0.045 Hz to 0.065 Hz in 41 out of 51 patients. The frequency of Traube waves or the respiratory variations was more than 0.14 Hz. Three categories of systolic and diastolic pressure variabilities namely beat-to-beat variability, Respiratory variability (Traube wave amplitude) and Total magnitude of variation are reported for all 51 patients. The mean systolic and diastolic pressure variations (in a period of about 10 minutes) in the study sample were 21 {+/-} 9 mm Hg and 14 {+/-} 5 mm Hg respectively. Given the magnitude of systolic and diastolic pressure variations over a few minutes, the validity of reporting single point values for these pressures and using single point cut-offs for diagnosis and treatment of hypertension must be re-evaluated.",

    "abstract": "It is well established that lack of physical activity is detrimental to overall health of an individual. Modern day activity trackers enable individuals to monitor their daily activity to meet and maintain targets and to promote activity encouraging behavior. However, the benefits of activity trackers are attenuated over time due to waning adherence. One of the key methods to improve adherence to goals is to motivate individuals to improve on their historic performance metrics. In this work we developed a machine learning model to dynamically adjust the activity target for the forthcoming week that can be realistically achieved by the activity-tracker users. This model prescribes activity target for the forthcoming week. We considered individual user-specific personal, social, and environmental factors, daily step count through the current week (7 days). In addition, we computed an entropy measure that characterizes the pattern of daily step count for the current week. Data for training the machine learning model was collected from 30 participants over a duration of 9 weeks. The model predicted target daily count with mean absolute error of 1545 steps. The proposed work can be used to set personalized goals in accordance with the individuals level of activity and thereby improving adherence to fitness tracker.",

Ticks were more frequent, and they belonged to three genera and four species, and the later included Hyalomma (H.) anatolicum (11.03%), Hyalomma (H.) rufipes (0.67%), Rhipicephalus (R.) everts (73.1%) and Amblyoma (A.) lepidium (15.2%).

There is a massive knowledge gap in transmission, infection route, and historically, it is believed to be associated with minor trauma caused by thorn pricks. This study was designed to determine the possible role of arthropods in mycetoma transmission in an endemic area in Sudan during the cold dry season. Pools of medically important arthropods were screened for mycetoma causative agents using DNA based method. The villagers habits and knowledge on arthropod vectors were examined using a pre-designed questionnaire. The results showed various presences of many arthropod vectors. Ticks were found in high prevalence, and densities in domestic animals found inside houses and the villagers had high contact level with the ticks in comparison to other vectors. The study reports for the first time, the detection of the causative agents of mycetoma in a pool of ticks. More studies on the possible role of ticks in the transmission of mycetoma diseases are badly needed to delineate the possible role of ticks on transmission of mycetoma.",

    "abstract": "Mosaic analysis provides a means to probe developmental processes in situ by generating loss-of-function mutants within otherwise wildtype tissues. Combining these techniques with quantitative microscopy enables researchers to rigorously compare RNA or protein expression across the resultant clones. However, visual inspection of mosaic tissues remains common in the literature because quantification demands considerable labor and computational expertise. Practitioners must segment cell membranes or cell nuclei from a tissue and annotate the clones before their data are suitable for analysis. Here, we introduce Fly-QMA, a computational framework that automates each of these tasks for confocal microscopy images of Drosophila imaginal discs. The framework includes an unsupervised annotation algorithm that incorporates spatial context to inform the genetic identity of each cell. We use a combination of real and synthetic validation data to survey the performance of the annotation algorithm across a broad range of conditions. By contributing our framework to the open-source software ecosystem, we aim to contribute to the current move toward automated quantitative analysis among developmental biologists.\\n\\nAuthor summaryBiologists use mosaic tissues to compare the behavior of genetically distinct cells within an otherwise equivalent context. The ensuing analysis is often limited to qualitative insight. However, it is becoming clear that quantitative models are needed to unravel the complexities of many biological systems. In this manuscript we introduce Fly-QMA, an open-source software framework that automates the quantification of mosaic analysis for Drosophila imaginal discs, a common setting for studies of developmental processes. The software automatically extracts quantitative measurements from confocal images of mosaic tissues, rectifies any cross-talk between fluorescent reporters, and identifies clonally-related subpopulations of cells. Together, these functions allow users to rigorously ascribe changes in gene expression to the presence or absence of particular genes. We validate the performance of our framework using both real and synthetic data. Through its publication, we aim to contribute to the current move toward automated quantitative analysis among biologists.",
