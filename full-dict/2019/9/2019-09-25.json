    "abstract": "Tumor heterogeneity and cisplatin resistance are a major cause of tumor relapse and poor survival. Here we show that in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), paxillin (PXN) and integrin beta 4 (ITGB4) are associated with tumor progression, and cisplatin resistance. Silencing PXN and ITGB4 render cisplatin tolerant cells sensitive, and immunologically neutralizing ITGB4 improves sensitivity. The N-terminal half of PXN is intrinsically disordered and interacts with ITGB4 to regulate expression of USP1 and VDAC1 which are required for maintaining genomic stability and mitochondrial function in LUAD. By virtual screening an FDA-approved compound library, we identified compounds that interact with PXN in silico and attenuate cisplatin resistance in LUAD cells. RNAseq analysis identified a double negative feedback loop between ITGB4 and microRNA miR-1-3p, suggesting that bistability could lead to stochastic switching between cisplatin-sensitive and resistant states in these cells. The data highlight an alternate, non-genetic, mechanism underlying chemoresistance in lung cancer.",

    "abstract": "BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA)-deficient tumor cells have defects in DNA double strand break repair by homologous recombination (HR) and fork protection (FP) that are thought to underlie the sensitivity to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi). Given the recent finding that PARPi accelerates DNA replication, it was proposed that high speed DNA replication leads to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). Here, we tested the alternative hypothesis that PARPi sensitivity in BRCA deficient cells results from combined replication dysfunction that causes a lethal accumulation of replication-associated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) gaps. In support of a gap toxicity threshold, PARPi-induced ssDNA gaps accumulate more excessively in BRCA deficient cells and are suppressed in de novo and genetic models of PARPi resistance while defects in HR or FP often lack this correlation. We also uncouple replication speed from lethality. The clear link between PARPi sensitivity and ssDNA gaps provides a new paradigm for understanding synthetic lethal interactions.",

    "abstract": "During active transcription, the COMPASS complex methylates histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me). In Caenorhabditis elegans, mutations in COMPASS subunits, including WDR-5, extend lifespan and enable the inheritance of increased lifespan in wild-type descendants. Here we show that the increased lifespan of wdr-5 mutants is itself a transgenerational trait that manifests after eighteen generations and correlates with changes in the heterochromatin factor H3K9me2. Additionally, we find that wdr-5 mutant longevity and its inheritance requires the H3K9me2 methyltransferase MET-2 and can be recapitulated by a mutation in the putative H3K9me2 demethylase JHDM-1. These data suggest that lifespan is constrained by reduced H3K9me2 due to transcription-coupled H3K4me. wdr-5 mutants alleviate this burden, extending lifespan and enabling the inheritance of increased lifespan. Thus, H3K9me2 functions in the epigenetic establishment and inheritance of a complex trait. Based on this model, we propose that lifespan is limited by the germline in part because germline transcription reduces heterochromatin.",

    "abstract": "Efficient generation of antibodies by B cells is one of the prerequisites of protective immunity. B cell activation by cognate antigens via B cell receptors (BCR), or pathogen-associated molecules through pattern-recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), leads to transcriptional and metabolic changes that ultimately transform B cells into antibody producing plasma cells or memory cells. BCR signaling and a number of steps downstream of it rely on coordinated action of cellular membranes and the actin cytoskeleton, tightly controlled by concerted action of multiple regulatory proteins, some of them exclusive to B cells. Here, we dissect the role of Missing-In-Metastasis (MIM), or Metastasis suppressor 1 (MTSS1), a cancer-associated membrane and actin cytoskeleton regulating protein, in B cell-mediated immunity by taking advantage of MIM knockout mouse strain. We show undisturbed B cell development and largely normal composition of B cell compartments in the periphery. Interestingly, we found that MIM-/- B cells are defected in BCR signaling in response to surface-bound antigens but, on the other hand, show increased metabolic activity after stimulation with LPS or CpG. In vivo, MIM knockout animals exhibit impaired IgM antibody responses to immunization with T cell-independent antigen. This study provides the first comprehensive characterization of MIM in B cells, demonstrates its regulatory role for B cell-mediated immunity, as well as proposes new functions for MIM in tuning receptor signaling and cellular metabolism, processes which may also contribute to the poorly understood functions of MIM in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Legionella pneumophila requires the Dot/Icm translocation system to replicate in a vacuolar compartment within host cells. Strains lacking the translocated substrate SdhA form a permeable vacuole during residence in the host cell, exposing bacteria to the host cytoplasm. In primary macrophages, mutants are defective for intracellular growth, with a pyroptotic cell death response mounted due to bacterial exposure to the cytosol. To understand how SdhA maintains vacuole integrity during intracellular growth, we performed high-throughput RNAi screens against host membrane trafficking genes to identify factors that antagonize vacuole integrity in the absence of SdhA. Depletion of host proteins involved in endocytic uptake and recycling resulted in enhanced intracellular growth and lower levels of permeable vacuoles surrounding the {Delta}sdhA mutant. Of interest were three different Rab GTPases involved in these processes: Rab11b, Rab8b and Rab5 isoforms, that when depleted resulted in enhanced vacuole integrity surrounding the sdhA mutant. Proteins regulated by these Rabs are responsible for interfering with proper vacuole membrane maintenance, as depletion of the downstream effectors EEA1, Rab11FIP1, or VAMP3 rescued vacuole integrity and intracellular growth of the sdhA mutant. To test the model that specific vesicular components associated with these effectors could act to destabilize the replication vacuole, EEA1 and Rab11FIP1 showed enhanced colocalization with the vacuole surrounding the sdhA mutant compared with the WT vacuole. Depletion of Rab5 isoforms or Rab11b reduced this aberrant colocalization. These findings are consistent with SdhA interfering with both endocytic and recycling membrane trafficking events that act to destabilize vacuole integrity during infection.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas systems provide bacteria with adaptive immunity against bacteriophages1. However, DNA modification2,3, the production of anti-CRISPR proteins4,5 and potentially other strategies enable phages to evade CRISPR-Cas. Here we discovered a Serratia jumbophage that evaded type I CRISPR-Cas systems, but was sensitive to type III immunity. Jumbophage infection resulted in a nucleus-like structure enclosed by a proteinaceous phage shell - a phenomenon only reported recently for distantly related Pseudomonas phages6,7. All three native CRISPR-Cas complexes in Serratia - type I-E, I-F and III-A - were spatially excluded from the phage nucleus and phage DNA was not targeted. However, the type III-A system still arrested jumbophage infection by targeting phage RNA in the cytoplasm in a process requiring Cas7, Cas10 and an accessory nuclease. Type III, but not type I, systems frequently targeted nucleus-forming jumbophages that were identified in global viral sequence datasets. These findings explain why many bacteria harbour both RNA- and DNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas systems1,8. Together, our results indicate that jumbophage nucleus-like compartments serve as a barrier to DNA-targeting, but not RNA-targeting defences, and that this phenomenon is widespread amongst jumbophages.",

    "abstract": "Urbanicity, the impact of living in urban areas, is among the greatest environmental challenges for mental health. While urbanicity might be distinct in different sociocultural conditions and geographic locations, there are likely to exist common features shared in different areas of the globe. Understanding these common and specific relations of urbanicity with human brain and behavior will enable to assess the impact of urbanicity on mental disorders, especially in childhood and adolescence, where prevention and early interventions are likely to be most effective.\\n\\nWe constructed from satellite-based remote sensing data a factor for urbanicity that was highly correlated with population density ground data. This factor,  UrbanSat was utilized in the Chinese CHIMGEN sample (N=831) and the longitudinal European IMAGEN cohort (N=810) to investigate if exposure to urbanicity during childhood and adolescence is associated with differences in brain structure and function in young adults, and if these changes are linked to behavior.\\n\\nUrbanicity was found negatively correlated with medial prefrontal cortex volume and positively correlated with cerebellar vermis volume in young adults from both China and Europe. We found an increased correlation of urbanicity with functional network connectivity within- and between- brain networks in Chinese compared to European participants. Urbanicity was highly correlated with a measure of perceiving a situation from the perspective of others, as well as symptoms of depression in both datasets. These correlations were mediated by the structural and functional brain changes observed. Susceptibility to urbanicity was greatest in two developmental windows during mid-childhood and adolescence.\\n\\nUsing innovative technology, we were able to probe the relationship between urban upbringing with brain change and behavior in different sociocultural conditions and geographic locations. Our findings help to identify shared and distinct determinants of adolescent brain development and mental health in different regions of the world, thus contributing to targeted prevention and early-intervention programs for young people in their unique environment.

    "abstract": "Motivation theories of obesity suggest that one of the brain mechanisms underlying pathological eating and weight gain is the dysregulation of dopaminergic circuits. While these dysregulations occur likely at the microscopic level, studies on gray matter volume reported macroscopic differences associated with obesity. One region suggested to play a key role in the pathophysiology of obesity is the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). We performed a meta-analysis of findings regarding NAcc volume and overweight/obesity. We additionally examined whether gray matter volume in the NAcc and other mesolimbic areas depends on the longitudinal trajectory of obesity, using the UK Biobank dataset. To this end, we analysed the data using a latent growth model, which identifies whether certain variables of interest (e.g. NAcc volume) is related to another variables (BMI) initial values or longitudinal trajectories. Our meta-analysis showed that, overall, NAcc volume is positively related to BMI. However, further analyses revealed that the relationship between NAcc volume and BMI is dependent on age. For younger individuals such relationship is positive, while for older adults it is negative. This was corroborated by our analysis in the UK Biobank dataset, which includes older adults, where we found that higher BMI was associated with lower NAcc and thalamus volume. Overall, our study suggests that increased NAcc volume in young age might be a vulnerability factor for obesity, while in the older age decreased NAcc volume with increased BMI might be an effect of prolonged influences of neuroinflammation on the brain.",

    "abstract": "Lithium is a mood stabilizer broadly used to prevent and treat symptoms of mania and depression in people with bipolar disorder (BD). Little is known, however, about its mode of action. Here, we analyzed the impact of lithium on synaptic vesicle (SV) cycling at presynaptic terminals releasing glutamate, a neurotransmitter previously implicated in BD and other neuropsychiatric conditions. We used the pHluorin-based synaptic tracer vGpH and a fully automated image processing pipeline to quantify the effect of lithium on both SV exocytosis and endocytosis in hippocampal neurons. We found that lithium selectively reduces SV exocytic rates during electrical stimulation, and markedly slows down SV recycling post-stimulation. Analysis of single bouton responses revealed the existence of functionally distinct excitatory synapses with varying sensitivity to lithium [-] some terminals show responses similar to untreated cells, while others are markedly impaired in their ability to recycle SVs. While the cause of this heterogeneity is unclear, these data indicate that lithium interacts with the SV machinery and influences glutamate release in a large fraction of excitatory synapses. Together, our findings show that lithium down modulates SV cycling, an effect consistent with clinical reports indicating hyperactivation of glutamate neurotransmission in BD.",

    "abstract": "Isogenic cells cultured together show heterogeneity in their proliferation rate. To determine the differences between fast and slow-proliferating cells, we developed a method to sort cells by proliferation rate, and performed RNA-seq on slow and fast proliferating subpopulations of pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and mouse fibroblasts. We found that slowly proliferating mESCs have a more naive pluripotent character. We identified an evolutionarily conserved proliferation-correlated transcriptomic signature that is common to all eukaryotes: fast cells have higher expression of genes for protein synthesis and protein degradation. This signature accurately predicted growth rate in yeast and cancer cells, and identified lineage-specific proliferation dynamics during development, using C. elegans scRNA-seq data. In contrast, sorting by mitochondria membrane potential revealed a highly cell-type specific mitochondria-state related transcriptome. mESCs with hyperpolarized mitochondria are fast proliferating, while the opposite is true for fibroblasts. The mitochondrial electron transport chain inhibitor antimycin affected slow and fast subpopulations differently. While a major transcriptional-signature associated with cell-to-cell heterogeneity in proliferation is conserved, the metabolic and energetic dependency of cell proliferation is cell-type specific.\n\nSynopsisBy performing RNA-seq on cells FACS sorted by their proliferation rate, this study identifies a gene expression signature capable of predicting proliferation rates in diverse eukaryotic cell types and species. This signature, applied to scRNAseq data from C.elegans, reveals lineage-specific differences in proliferation during development. In contrast to the universality of the proliferation signature, mitochondria and metabolism related genes show a high degree of cell-type specificity; mouse pluripotent stem cells (mESCs) and differentiated cells (fibroblasts) exhibit opposite relations between mitochondria state and proliferation. Furthermore, we identified a slow proliferating subpopulation of mESCs with higher expression of pluripotency genes.

DNA fiber analysis and electron microscopy reveal that TLS restricts replication fork slowing, reversal, and fork degradation without inducing replication fork gaps. Evidence that TLS gap suppression is fundamental to cancer, a small molecule inhibitor targeting the TLS factor, REV1, not only disrupts DNA replication and cancer cell fitness, but also synergizes with gap-inducing therapies.

    "abstract": "The genomes of different individuals of the same prokaryote species can vary widely in gene content, displaying different proportions of core genes, which are present in all genomes, and accessory genes, whose presence varies between genomes. Together, these core and accessory genes make up a species pangenome. The reasons behind this extensive diversity in gene content remain elusive, and there is an ongoing debate about the contribution of accessory genes to fitness, that is, whether their presence is on average advantageous, neutral, or deleterious. In order to explore this issue, we developed a mathematical model to simulate the gene content of prokaryote genomes and pangenomes. Our model focuses on testing how the fitness effects of genes and their rates of gene gain and loss would affect the properties of pangenomes. We first show that pangenomes with large numbers of low-frequency genes can arise due to the gain and loss of neutral and nearly neutral genes in a population. However, pangenomes with large numbers of highly beneficial, low-frequency genes can arise as a consequence of genotype-by-environment interactions when multiple niches are available to a species. Finally, pangenomes can arise, irrespective of the fitness effect of the gained and lost genes, as long as gene gain and loss rates are high. We argue that in order to understand the contribution of different mechanisms to pangenome diversity, it is crucial to have empirical information on population structure, gene-by-environment interactions, the distributions of fitness effects and rates of gene gain and loss in different prokaryote groups.",

    "abstract": "The pH 6 antigen of Yersinia pestis is a virulence factor that is expressed in response to high temperature (37 {degrees}C) and low pH (6.0). Previous studies have implicated the PsaE and PsaF regulators in the temperature- and pH-dependent regulation of psaA. Here, we show that PsaE levels are themselves controlled by pH and temperature, explaining the regulation of psaA. We identify hundreds of binding sites for PsaE across the Y. pestis genome, with the majority of binding sites located in intergenic regions. However, we detect direct regulation of very few genes by PsaE, suggesting either that most binding sites are non-regulatory, or that they require additional environmental cues. We also identify the precise binding site for PsaE that is required for temperature- and pH-dependent regulation of psaA. Thus, our data reveal the critical function that PsaE plays in regulation of psaA, and suggest that PsaE may have many additional regulatory targets.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic feedback between the gut and the brain relayed via the vagus nerve contributes to energy homeostasis. We investigated in healthy adults whether non-invasive stimulation of vagal afferents impacts energy homeostasis via efferent effects on metabolism or digestion. In a randomized crossover design, we applied transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) while recording efferent metabolic effects using simultaneous electrogastrography (EGG) and indirect calorimetry. We found that taVNS reduced gastric myoelectric frequency (p =.008), but did not alter resting energy expenditure. We conclude that stimulating vagal afferents induces gastric slowing via vagal efferents without acutely affecting net energy expenditure at rest. Collectively, this highlights the potential of taVNS to modulate digestion by activating the dorsal vagal complex. Thus, taVNS-induced changes in gastric frequency are an important peripheral marker of brain stimulation effects.",

    "abstract": "Manganese Enhanced MRI (MEMRI) utilizing different manganese chloride (MnCl2) delivery methods, has yielded valuable architectural, functional and connection information about the brain. MEMRI also has the potential in characterizing neural pathways in the spinal cord. The spinal cord grey matter is anatomically composed of nine distinct cellular laminae, where each of the laminae receives input from a specific type of neuronal population and process or serves as a relay region in a specific sensory or motor pathway. This type of laminar arrangement in the spinal cord is currently only visualized by histological methods. It is of significant interest to determine whether laminar specific enhancement by Mn2+ can be achieved in the spinal cord, as has been reported in the brain and olfactory pathway. Here we focus on using MEMRI to determine the specific laminae of the thoracic region of the spinal cord. We focus on MnCl2 changes in the ascending and descending tracts of the spinal cord. Major factors in applying this technique in the spinal cord are the ability to acquire high-resolution spinal cord images and to determine a noninvasive route of administration which will result in uptake by the central nervous system.\\n\\nWe have applied the MEMRI approach by intraperitoneal (i.p). delivery of MnCl2 and imaged lumbar and thoracic spinal cord levels in rats to determine whether T1 weighted MRI can detect spinal cord laminae 48 hours following MnCl2 administration. T1 weighted images of the lower lumbar level were obtained from MnCl2 injected and control rats. Here we demonstrate laminar specific signal enhancement in the spinal cord of rats administered with MnCl2 vs. controls in MRI of the cord with ultra-high, 69 m in-plane resolution. We also report reduced T1 values over time in MnCl2 groups across laminae I-IX. The regions with the largest T1 enhancements were observed to correspond to laminae that contain either high cell density or large motor neurons, making MEMRI an excellent tool for studying spinal cord architecture, physiology and function in different animal models.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial oxidative metabolism is central to glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Whether Ca2+ uptake into pancreatic {beta}-cell mitochondria potentiates or antagonises this process is still a matter of debate. Although the mitochondrial importer (MCU) complex is thought to represent the main route for Ca2+ transport across the inner mitochondrial membrane, its role in {beta}-cells has not previously been examined in vivo. Here, we inactivated the pore-forming subunit MCUa (MCU) selectively in the {beta}-cell in mice using Ins1Cre-mediated recombination. Glucose-stimulated mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation, ATP production and insulin secretion were strongly (p<0.05 and p<0.01) inhibited in MCU null animals ({beta}MCU-KO) in vitro. Interestingly, cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations increased (p<0.001) whereas mitochondrial membrane depolarisation improved in {beta}MCU-KO animals. Male {beta}MCU-KO mice displayed impaired in vivo insulin secretion at 5 (p<0.001) but not 15 min. post intraperitoneal (IP) injection of glucose while the opposite phenomenon was observed following an oral gavage at 5 min. Unexpectedly, glucose tolerance was improved (p<0.05) in young {beta}MCU-KO (<12 weeks), but not older animals. We conclude that MCU is crucial for mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in pancreatic {beta}-cells and is required for normal GSIS. The apparent compensatory mechanisms which maintain glucose tolerance in {beta}MCU-KO mice remain to be established.",

    "abstract": "Government regulators and others concerned about toxic chemicals in the environment hold that a mechanistic, causal explanation of toxicity is strongly preferred over a statistical or machine learning-based prediction by itself. Elucidating a mechanism of toxicity is, however, a costly and time-consuming process that requires the participation of specialists from a variety of fields, often relying on animal models. We present an innovative mechanistic inference framework (MechSpy), which can be used as a hypothesis generation aid to narrow the scope of mechanistic toxicology analysis. MechSpy generates hypotheses of the most likely mechanisms of toxicity, by combining a semantically-interconnected knowledge representation of human biology, toxicology and biochemistry with gene expression time series on human tissue. Using vector representations of biological entities, MechSpy seeks enrichment in a manually-curated list of high-level mechanisms of toxicity, represented as biochemically- and causally-linked ontology concepts. Besides predicting the canonical mechanism of toxicity for many well-studied compounds, we experimentally validated some of our predictions for other chemicals without an established mechanism of toxicity. This framework can be modified to include additional mechanisms of toxicity, and is generalizable to other types of mechanisms of human biology.\\n\\nAuthor summarySeveral recent computational methods have displayed excellent performance in predicting toxicity outcomes [1-3] of chemicals. Yet, to our knowledge, there is to date no computational approach to generate mechanistic hypotheses to answer why these chemicals elicit a toxic response. There is great value in understanding the mechanism of toxicity for a chemical that appears to elicit an adverse response. Novel small molecule development is one example, where a chemical that failed initial toxicological screenings could be assessed to evaluate the actual mechanism of toxicity, greatly reducing research time and expenses on subsequent ones. The value of a mechanistic awareness of toxicity also applies to pharmacovigilance, when researching rare adverse effects of a drug in subsets of the population. The development of oncological chemotherapeutics is another example, where certain mechanisms of cytotoxicity can actually be desirable to eliminate different types of tumor cells. More importantly, the costs, time expenditure, and ethical concerns of toxicity animal models, make in vitro and in silico approaches an enticing alternative. We present a solution that uses a combination of gene expression assays and biomedical knowledge to address the gap of answering the why question.",

    "abstract": "Fibrolamellar Hepatocellular Carcinoma (FLC) is a rare liver cancer that primarily affects adolescents and young adults. Up to now there is only one identified molecular target responsible for driving the disease, the chimeric protein encoded by DNAJB1-PRKACA (J-PKAca). Immune cells have been identified as key players in liver cancer biology, however the effect of J-PKAca on inflammation in the liver microenvironment is not known. Here we report a new zebrafish model of FLC with non-invasive live imaging capabilities that allows the study of the interactions between immune cells and transformed hepatocytes. We found that overexpression of the dnajb1a-prkcaaa fusion gene specifically in hepatocytes induces early malignancy features in FLC transgenic larvae, such as increased liver and hepatocyte size. In addition, this aberrant form of PKA promotes a pro-inflammatory liver microenvironment by increasing the number of neutrophils and macrophages in the liver area and inducing macrophage polarization to a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Increased caspase-a activity was also found in the liver of FLC transgenic larvae. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of TNF secretion and caspase-a activity decreased liver size and inflammation. Overall, these findings suggest that inflammation may be an early feature of FLC involved in progression, and that targeting TNFand caspase-1 may be beneficial in treating FLC.",

    "abstract": "Fusarium verticillioides is a fungal pathogen that is responsible for maize ear rot and stalk rot diseases worldwide. The fungus also produces carcinogenic mycotoxins, fumonisins, on infested maize. Unfortunately, we still lack clear understanding of how the pathogen responds to host and environmental stimuli to trigger fumonisin biosynthesis. The heterotrimeric G protein complex, consisting of canonical G, G{beta}, and G{gamma} subunits, is involved in transducing signals from external stimuli to regulate downstream signal transduction pathways. Previously, we demonstrated that G{beta} protein FvGbb1 has direct impact on fumonisin regulation but no other physiological aspects in F. verticillioides. In this study, we identified and characterized a putative receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) homolog FvGbb2 as a putative G{beta}-like protein in F. verticillioides. The mutant exhibited severe defects not only in fumonisin biosynthesis but also vegetative growth and conidiation. FvGbb2 was positively associated with carbon source utilization and stress agents but negatively regulated general amino acid control. While FvGbb2 does not interact with canonical G protein subunits, it may interact with diverse proteins in the cytoplasm to regulate vegetative growth, virulence, fumonisin biosynthesis, and stress response in F. verticillioides.",

Different strategies to prevent this infection have been evaluated, including live-attenuated vaccines (LAV) based on SH and/or G protein deletions. This approach showed promising outcomes but has not been evaluated further using different viral strains. In that regard, we previously showed that different HMPV strains harbor distinct in vitro fusogenic and in vivo pathogenic phenotypes, possibly influencing the selection of vaccine strains. In this study, we investigated the putative contribution of the low conserved SH or G accessory proteins in such strain-dependent phenotypes and generated recombinant wild type (WT) and SH- or G-deleted viruses derived from two different patient-derived HMPV strains, A1/C-85473 and B2/CAN98-75.\\n\\nThe {Delta}SH and {Delta}G deletions led to different strain-specific phenotypes in both LLC-MK2 cell and reconstituted human airway epithelium models.

In conclusion, our results show that the viral genetic backbone should be considered in the design of live-attenuated HMPV vaccines, and that a SH-deleted virus based on the A1/C-85473 HMPV strain could be a promising LAV candidate as it is both attenuated and protective in mice while being efficiently produced in a cell-based system.",

    "abstract": "Brazil is the largest world producer of yellow passion fruit, but the mean yield (14.3t.ha-1) is less than half the potential of the crop. Part of this difference can be explained by plant health problems, including anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. In regions with favorable climatic conditions, anthracnose can be a factor of significant yield reduction, but these regions have not yet been zoned. The objective of this study was to model the pre-infection dynamics of the fungus. The influence of temperature and photoperiod was studied on mycelia growth, sporulation and conidia germination. Mathematical models were fitted to the results and the optima for the environmental variables were estimated. The maximum mycelia growth was estimated to occur at 26.5{degrees}C. Between 24.5{degrees}C and 28.5{degrees}C the fungus grew from 95% to 100% of the estimated maximum. Temperatures below 13{degrees}C or above 34{degrees}C were harmful to mycelia growth. Temperatures over 26{degrees}C were the most favorable to sporulation while below 13{degrees}C sporulation was only 5% of the maximum. Optimum germination occurred between 25{degrees}C and 29{degrees}C with the ideal wetness period between 11h and 13h. These results can be used as a basis for zoning the risk of anthracnose occurrence in passion fruit producing regions.\\n\\nSignificance and Impact of the StudyMany diseases affect the yellow passion fruit crop, limiting its yield; among them anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum spp. The disease occurs in both field (leaf and stem symptoms) and post-harvest (fruits) conditions. Understanding the role environmental conditions play in the biological cycle of such diseases is essential for developing management strategies. By modelling mycelial growth, spore production and spore germination of Colletotrichum spp. as affected by temperature, photoperiod and wetness period, it was possible to characterize the pathogens pre-infectional dynamics. The results should be used as a first approximation to estimate the risk of anthracnose occurrence in pre- or post-harvest.",

The effect of formula was especially strong in premature newborns and newborns treated with antibiotics. Interestingly, antibiotics alone without formula did not have a detectable impact on the ARG load of the newborn gut. We also observed that formula-fed infants had enriched numbers of pathogenic species and were depleted in typical infant gut species such as Bifidobacterium bifidum.

Although the incidence of pertussis was reduced through vaccination, during the last thirty years it has returned to high levels in a number of countries.

Protection afforded by acellular vaccines appears to be short-lived compared to that afforded by whole cell vaccines. In order to inform future vaccine improvement by identifying immune correlates of protection, a human challenge model of B. pertussis colonisation has been developed. Accurate measurement of colonisation status in this model has required development of a qPCR-based assay to enumerate B. pertussis in samples that distinguishes between viable and dead bacteria. Here we report the development of this assay and its performance in the quantification of B. pertussis from human challenge model samples. This assay has future utility in diagnostic labs and in research where a quantitative measure of both B. pertussis number and viability is required.",

    "abstract": "A defined amount of transcript is produced from transcription start sites (TSSs) of each gene, suggesting that the binding frequency of RNA polymerase varies among genes. However, what structure in chromatin controls this frequency remains elusive. We established a method to fractionate chromatin according to its degree of three-dimensional compaction. Nucleosomes were evenly detected through all of the fractions, but histone H1 was more highly enriched in the more compact chromatin fractions. Similarly, HP1 and MBD2b were more abundant in more compact chromatin, while the levels of tri-methylated H3 (Lys9) and 5-methyl cytosine subtly increased. Via genome-wide analyses, nearly the entire genome was found to exist in compact chromatin without variations between repeat and non-repeat sequences; however, active TSSs were rarely found in compact chromatin. Based on a correlation between weak compaction and RNA polymerase binding at TSSs, it appears that local states of chromatin compaction determine transcription levels.",

    "abstract": "The plant hormone auxin regulates almost every aspect of plant development via the TIR1/AFB-auxin-Aux/IAA auxin co-receptor complex. Within this ternary complex, auxin acts as a molecular glue to promote the binding of Aux/IAA transcriptional repressor proteins to SCFTIR1/AFB ubiquitin-ligase complexes, thereby catalysing their ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. A conspicuous feature of the crystal structure of the complex is a rare cis W-P bond within the Aux/IAA degron motif. To study receptor complex assembly, we have used NMR to determine the solution structure of the amino-terminal half of the Aux/IAA protein AXR3/IAA17, including the degron, both in isolation and in complex with TIR1 and auxin. We show that this region of AXR3 is intrinsically-disordered with only limited elements of structure and yet the critical degron W-P bond occurs with an unusually high (1:1) ratio of cis to trans isomers. We show that assembly of the co-receptor complex involves both auxin-dependent and -independent interaction events in which the disorder of the Aux/IAA is retained. Further, using the synthetic auxin molecule cvxIAA and by analysing specific Aux/IAA conformers, we show that a subset of auxin-dependent binding events occur away from the base of the canonical auxin binding pocket in TIR1. Our results reveal the existence of a fuzzy, topologically-distinct ternary encounter complex and thus that auxin perception is not limited to sequential, independent binding of auxin and then Aux/IAA to TIR1.",

    "abstract": "A growing number of studies indicate that plant viruses enhance their own transmission by modifying host phenotypes and vector behavior, leading to the hypothesis that such effects are manipulations resulting from virus adaptations. However, few studies have linked putative manipulations with virus components, and the true frequency and magnitude of host and vector manipulation across virus taxa remains unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we performed a meta-analysis to quantify convergence in virus effects on hosts and vectors across taxonomic groups that share transmission mechanism traits, and thereby stand to benefit from similar sequences of vector behavior. We then combined meta-analysis outputs with an epidemiological model to assess consequences of manipulation for virus spread. Overall, transmission mechanism traits strongly predicted the magnitude and nature of virus effects on vector preferences and performance. Models parameterized with meta-analysis data demonstrate that manipulation effects enhance virus spread, and that viruses with long acquisition times and retention durations are under strong selection pressure to manipulate transmission. By combining meta-analysis with epidemiological modeling, our results confirm that host and vector manipulation are important aspects of plant virus ecology and evolution while emphasizing the need to incorporate more pathosystems and transmission mechanism traits in future studies.",

However, testing single genes separately does not consider the complex interaction landscape of genes, nor the downstream effects of non-synonymous variants on protein structure and function. Here we present the NETwork Propagation-based Assessment of Genetic Events (NETPAGE), an integrative approach aimed at investigating the biological pathways through which rare variation results in complex disease phenotypes.\\n\\nResultsWe applied NETPAGE to sporadic, late-onset Alzheimers disease (AD), using whole-genome sequencing from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, as well as whole-exome sequencing from the AD Sequencing Project (ADSP). NETPAGE is based on network propagation, a framework that models information flow on a graph and simulates the percolation of genetic variation through gene networks. The result of network propagation is a set of smoothed gene scores used to predict disease status through sparse regression. The application of NETPAGE to AD enabled the identification of a set of connected genes whose smoothed mutation profile acted as a robust predictor of case-control status, based on gene interactions in the hippocampus. Additionally, smoothed scores significantly correlated with risk of conversion to AD in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) subjects. Lastly, we showed tissue-specific transcriptional dysregulation of the core genes in two independent RNA-seq datasets, as well as significant enrichments in terms and gene sets with known connections to AD.\\n\\nConclusionsThe presented framework enables enhanced genetic association testing for a wide range of traits, diseases, and sample sizes.",

    "abstract": "Population genetic theory states that adaptation most frequently occurs from standing genetic variation, which results from the interplay between different evolutionary processes including mutation, chromosomal rearrangements, drift, gene flow and selection. To date, empirical work focusing on the contribution of standing genetic variation to local adaptation in the presence of high gene flow has been limited to a restricted number of study systems. Marine organisms are excellent biological models to address this issue since many species have to cope with variable environmental conditions acting as selective agents despite high dispersal abilities. In this study, we examined how, demographic history, standing genetic variation linked to chromosomal rearrangements and shared polymorphism among glacial lineages contribute to local adaptation to environmental conditions in the marine fish, the capelin (Mallotus villosus). We used a comprehensive dataset of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (25,904 filtered SNPs) genotyped in 1,359 individuals collected from 31 spawning sites in the northwest Atlantic (North America and Greenland waters). First, we reconstructed the history of divergence among three glacial lineages and showed that they diverged from 3.8 to 1.8 MyA. Depending on the pair of lineages considered, historical demographic modelling provided evidence for divergence with gene flow and secondary contacts, shaped by barriers to gene flow and linked selection. We next identified candidate loci associated with reproductive isolation of these lineages. Given the absence of physical or geographic barriers, we thus propose that these lineages may represent three cryptic species of capelin. Within each of these, our analyses provided evidence for large Ne and high gene flow at both historical and contemporary time scales among spawning sites. Furthermore, we detected a polymorphic chromosomal rearrangement leading to the coexistence of three haplogroups within the Northwest Atlantic lineage, but absent in the other two clades. Genotype-environment associations revealed molecular signatures of local adaptation to environmental conditions prevailing at spawning sites. Altogether, our study shows that standing genetic variation associated with both chromosomal rearrangements and ancestral polymorphism contribute to local adaptation in the presence of high gene flow.",

    "abstract": "A key step in the chlorine cycle is the reduction of perchlorate (ClO4-) and chlorate (ClO3-) to chloride by microbial respiratory pathways. Perchlorate-reducing bacteria and chlorate-reducing bacteria differ in that the latter cannot use perchlorate, the most oxidized chlorine compound. However, a recent study identified a bacterium with the chlorate reduction pathway dominating a community provided only perchlorate. Here we confirm a metabolic interaction between perchlorate- and chlorate-reducing bacteria and define its mechanism. Perchlorate-reducing bacteria supported the growth of chlorate-reducing bacteria to up to 90% of total cells in communities and co-cultures. Chlorate-reducing bacteria required the gene for chlorate reductase to grow in co-culture with perchlorate-reducing bacteria, demonstrating that chlorate is responsible for the interaction, not the subsequent intermediates chlorite and oxygen. Modeling of the interaction suggested that cells specialized for chlorate reduction have a competitive advantage for consuming chlorate produced from perchlorate, especially at high concentrations of perchlorate, because perchlorate and chlorate compete for a single enzyme in perchlorate-reducing cells. We conclude that perchlorate-reducing bacteria inadvertently support large populations of chlorate-reducing bacteria in a parasitic relationship through the release of the intermediate chlorate. An implication of these findings is that undetected chlorate-reducing bacteria have likely negatively impacted efforts to bioremediate perchlorate pollution for decades.",

We hypothesized that this discrepancy in tumor location is a consequence of the differential sensitivity of BRAF and NRAS-mutant melanocytes to ultraviolet light (UV)-mediated carcinogenesis. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the mutagenic consequences of a single, narrow band ultraviolet-A (UVA; 320-400nm) or ultraviolet-B (UVB; 280-320nm) exposure in mouse models predisposed to Braf- or Nras-mutant melanoma. Exposures approximated the amount of UVA or UVB energy contained in ~40 minutes of summer sunlight. Tumor onset was accelerated in all UVB-, but only half of UVA- irradiated mice as compared to unirradiated controls. Melanomas from both mouse models, harbored recurrent mutations affecting the RING domain of MAP3K1 and Actin-binding domain of Filamin A irrespective of UV status. Melanomas from UVB-irradiated, Braf-mutant mice averaged twice as many SNVs (1,025 vs. 435) and five times as many dipyrimidine variants (33.3 vs. 5.7) than tumors from similarly irradiated Nras-mutant mice. We identified a mutational signature enriched in UVB-accelerated tumors which mirrored COSMIC signatures associated with human skin cancer. Notably, this signature was enriched to a greater extent in Braf- than Nras-mutant murine melanomas. These data suggest that oncogenic BRAF may enhance UVB carcinogenesis to promote melanoma formation at anatomic sites with low or intermittent sun exposure.",

    "abstract": "Drug addiction is a worldwide health problem, with overdose rates of both psychostimulants and opioids currently on the rise in many developed countries. Drugs of abuse elevate dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and alter transcriptional programs believed to promote long-lasting synaptic and behavioral adaptations. However, even with well-studied drugs such as cocaine, drug-induced transcriptional responses remain poorly understood due to the cellular heterogeneity of the NAc and complex drug actions via multiple neurotransmitter systems. Here, we leveraged high-throughput single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to create a comprehensive molecular atlas of cell subtypes in the NAc, defining both sex-specific and cell type-specific responses to acute cocaine experience in a rat model system. Using this transcriptional map, we identified specific neuronal subpopulations that are activated by cocaine, and defined an immediate early gene expression program that is upregulated following cocaine experience in vivo and dopamine (DA) receptor activation in vitro. To characterize the neuronal response to this DA-mediated gene expression signature, we engineered a large-scale CRISPR/dCas9 activation strategy to recreate this program. Multiplexed induction of this gene program initiated a secondary synapse-centric transcriptional profile, altered striatal physiology in vitro, and enhanced cocaine sensitization in vivo. Taken together, these results define the genome-wide transcriptional response to cocaine with cellular precision, and demonstrate that drug-responsive gene programs are sufficient to initiate both physiological and behavioral adaptations to drugs of abuse.",

    "abstract": "Neuromelanin-sensitive MRI (NM-MRI) provides a noninvasive measure of the content of neuromelanin (NM), a product of dopamine metabolism that accumulates with age in dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra (SN). NM-MRI has been validated as a measure of both dopamine neuron loss, with applications in neurodegenerative disease, and dopamine function, with applications in psychiatric disease. Furthermore, a voxelwise-analysis approach has been validated to resolve substructures, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA), within midbrain dopaminergic nuclei thought to have distinct anatomical targets and functional roles. NM-MRI is thus a promising tool that could have diverse research and clinical applications to noninvasively interrogate in vivo the dopamine system in neuropsychiatric illness. Although a test-retest reliability study by Langley et al. using the standard NM-MRI protocol recently reported high reliability, a systematic and comprehensive investigation of the performance of the method for various acquisition parameters and preprocessing methods has not been conducted. In particular, most previous studies used relatively thick MRI slices ([~]3 mm), compared to the typical in-plane resolution ([~]0.5 mm) and to the height of the SN ([~]15 mm), to overcome technical limitations such as specific absorption rate and signal-to-noise ratio, at the cost of partial-volume effects. Here, we evaluated the effect of various acquisition and preprocessing parameters on the strength and test-retest reliability of the NM-MRI signal to determine optimized protocols for both region-of-interest (including whole SN/VTA-complex and atlas-defined dopaminergic nuclei) and voxelwise measures. Namely, we determined a combination of parameters that optimizes the strength and reliability of the NM-MRI signal, including acquisition time, slice-thickness, spatial-normalization software, and degree of spatial smoothing. Using a newly developed, detailed acquisition protocol, across two scans separated by 13 days on average, we obtained intra-class correlation values indicating excellent reliability and high contrast-to-noise, which could be achieved with a different set of parameters depending on the measures of interest and experimental constraints such as acquisition time.

    "abstract": "Immunostaining of brain slices is a ubiquitous technique used throughout neuroscience for the purposes of understanding the anatomical and molecular characteristics of brain circuits. Yet the variety of distortions introduced, and the manual nature of the preparation, hinder the use of the generated images from being rigorously quantified; instead most registration of brain slices is done laboriously by hand. Existing automated registration methods rarely make use of geometric shape information. When registering anterior-posterior brain slices, for example, small errors between consecutive planes accumulate, causing the symmetry axis of a plane to drift away from its starting position as depth increases. Furthermore, planes with imaging artifacts - e.g. one half of the slice is missing - can cause large errors, which are difficult to fix by changing global parameters. In this work we describe a method in which we register a set of consecutive brain slices enforcing all slices to have a vertical axis of symmetry, and then pair these slices optimally to planes from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas via Dynamic Programming. The pipeline offers multiple human-in-the-loop opportunities, allowing users to fix algorithmic errors in various stages, including symmetry detection and pairwise assignment, via custom graphical interfaces. This pipeline enables large-scale analysis of brain slices, allowing this common technique to be used to generate quantitative datasets.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to investigate insulin amyloid fibril polymorphism caused by salt effects and heating temperature, and to visualize the structural differences of the polymorphisms in situ using Raman imaging without labeling. The time course monitoring for amyloid formation was carried out in an acidic condition without any salts and with two species of salts (NaCl and Na2SO4) by heating at 60, 70, 80, and 90 . The intensity ratio of two Raman bands at 1672 and 1657 cm-1 due to {beta}-sheet and -helix structures was revealed to be an indicator of amyloid fibril formation, and the relative proportion of the {beta}-sheet structure was higher in the case with salts, especially at a higher temperature and with Na2SO4. In conjunction with the secondary structural changes of proteins, the S-S stretching vibrational mode of a disulfide bond ([~]514 cm-1) and the ratio of the tyrosine doublet R(I850/I826) were also found to be markers distinguishing polymorphisms of insulin amyloid fibrils by principal component analysis (PCA). Especially, amyloid fibrils with Na2SO4 media formed the g-g-g conformation of disulfide bond at a higher rate and without any salts; on the contrary, the g-g-g conformation was partially transformed into the g-g-t conformation at higher temperatures. The different environments of the hydroxyl groups of the tyrosine residue were assumed to be caused by fibril polymorphism. Raman imaging using these marker bands also successfully visualized the two- and three-dimensional structural differences of amyloid polymorphisms. The present results indicate the potential of Raman imaging as a diagnostic tool for polymorphisms in tissues of amyloid-related diseases.\\n\\nStatement of SignificanceOur results revealed three Raman markers distinguishing amyloid fibril polymorphisms caused by salt and temperature effects; the relative proportion of protein secondary structures (-helix and {beta}-sheet), the ratio of tyrosine doublet, and the conformational differences of disulfide bonds. The lower values of tyrosine doublet in the case with salts were interpreted as the anions rob the hydration water from proteins which induced protein misfolding. Using these parameters, Raman images captured their higher order structural differences in situ without labeling. The images of hydrogen bonds strength variations due to tyrosine doublet is believed to include significant novelty. The present results imply the potential of Raman imaging for use as a diagnostic imaging tool for tissues with amyloid-induced diseases.",

We isolated an Escherichia strain from an international traveller and resolved the complete DNA sequence of the chromosome and an IncI multi-drug resistance plasmid using Illumina and Nanopore whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Strain OPT1704T can be differentiated from existing Escherichia spp. using biochemical (VITEK2) and genomic tests (average nucleotide identity [ANI] and digital DNA:DNA hybridisation [dDDH]). Phylogenetic analysis based on alignment of 16S rRNA sequences and 682 concatenated core genes showed similar results. Our analysis further revealed that strain OPT1704T falls within Escherichia cryptic clade IV, and is closely related to cryptic clade III. Combining our analyses with publicly available WGS data of cryptic clades III and IV from Enterobase confirmed the close relationship between clades III and IV (>96% interclade ANI), warranting assignment of both clades to the same novel species. We propose E. ruysiae sp. nov. as a novel species, encompassing Escherichia cryptic clades III and IV (type strain OPT1704T = NCCB 100732T = NCTC 14359T).\n\nAuthor notesThe Genbank accession number for the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain OPT1704T is LR745848.

    "abstract": "Mendelian randomisation analysis has emerged as an important tool to elucidate the causal relevance of a range of environmental and biological risk factors for human disease. However, inference on cause is undermined if the genetic variants used to instrument a risk factor of interest also associate with other traits that open alternative pathways to the disease (horizontal pleiotropy). We show how the  no horizontal pleiotropy assumption in MR analysis is strengthened when proteins are the risk factors of interest. Proteins are the proximal effectors of biological processes encoded in the genome, and are becoming assayable on an-omics scale. Moreover, proteins are the targets of most medicines, so Mendelian randomization (MR) studies of drug targets are becoming a fundamental tool in drug development. To enable such studies we introduce a formal mathematical framework that contrasts MR analysis of proteins with that of risk factors located more distally in the causal chain from gene to disease. Finally, we illustrate key model decisions and introduce an analytical framework for maximizing power and elucidating the robustness of drug target MR analyses.",

    "abstract": "Difficulties with sociability include a tendency to avoid social contacts and activities, and to prefer being alone rather than being with others. While sociability is a continuously distributed trait in the population, decreased sociability represent a common early manifestation of multiple neuropsychiatric disorders such as Schizophrenia (SCZ), Bipolar Disorder (BP), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs), and Alzheimers disease (AD). We aimed to investigate the genetic underpinnings of sociability as a continuous trait in the general population. In this respect, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a sociability score based on 4 social functioning-related self-report questions in the UK Biobank sample (n=342,461) to test the effect of individual genetic variants. This was followed by LD score analyses to investigate the genetic correlation with psychiatric disorders (SCZ, BP, MDD, ASDs) and a neurological disorder (AD) as well as related phenotypes (Loneliness and Social Anxiety). The phenotypic data indeed showed that the sociability score was decreased in individuals with ASD, (probable) MDD, BP and SCZ, but not in individuals with AD. Our GWAS showed 604 genome-wide significant SNPs, coming from 18 independent loci (SNP-based h2=0.06). Genetic correlation analyses showed significant correlations with SCZ (rg=0.15, p=9.8e-23), MDD (rg=0.68, p=6.6e-248) and ASDs (rg=0.27, p=4.5e-28), but no correlation with BP (rg=0.01, p=0.45) or AD (rg=0.04, p=0.55). Our sociability trait was also genetically correlated with Loneliness (rg=0.45, p=2.4e-8) and Social Anxiety (rg=0.48, p=0.002). Our study shows that there is a significant genetic component to variation in population levels of sociability, which is relevant to some psychiatric disorders (SCZ, MDD, ASDs), but not to BP and AD.",

Here, we developed a biophysically constrained statistical framework for addressing this question and applied it to assess the performance of a widely used method based on a failure-rate analysis to quantify the occurrence of silent (AMPAR-lacking) synapses in neural networks. We simulated this method in silico and found that it is characterized by strong and systematic biases, poor reliability and weak statistical power. Key conclusions were validated by whole-cell recordings from hippocampal neurons. To address these shortcomings, we developed a simulator of the experimental protocol and used it to compute a synthetic likelihood. By maximizing the likelihood, we inferred silent synapse fraction with no bias, low variance and superior statistical power over alternatives. Together, this generalizable approach highlights how a simulator of experimental methodologies can substantially improve the estimation of physiological properties.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary inflammatory responses lie under circadian control; however the importance of circadian mechanisms in fibrosis is not understood. Here, we identify a striking change to these mechanisms resulting in a gain of amplitude and lack of synchrony within pulmonary fibrotic tissue. These changes result from an infiltration of mesenchymal cells, an important cell type in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. Mutation of the core clock protein REVERB in these cells exacerbated the development of bleomycin-induced fibrosis, whereas mutation of REVERB in club or myeloid cells had no effect on the bleomycin phenotype. Knockdown of REVERB revealed regulation of the poorly described transcription factor TBPL1. Both REVERB and TBPL1 altered integrin{beta}1 focal adhesion formation, resulting in increased myofibroblast activation. The translational importance of our findings was established through analysis of two human cohorts. In the UK Biobank circadian strain markers (sleep length, chronotype and shift work) are associated with pulmonary fibrosis making them novel risk factors. In a separate cohort REVERB expression was increased in human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) lung tissue. Pharmacological targeting of REVERB inhibited myofibroblast activation in IPF fibroblasts and collagen secretion in organotypic cultures from IPF patients, suggesting targeting REVERB could be a viable therapeutic approach.\\n\\nSignificanceThe circadian clock plays an essential role in energy metabolism, and inflammation. In contrast the importance of the clock in the pathogenesis of fibrosis remains poorly explored. This study describes a striking alteration in circadian biology during pulmonary fibrosis where the relatively arrhythmic alveolar structures gain circadian but desynchronous rhythmicity due to infiltration by fibroblasts. Disruption of the clock in these cells, which are not widely implicated in circadian pathophysiology, results in a pro-fibrotic phenotype. Translation of these findings in humans revealed previously unrecognised important circadian risk factors for pulmonary fibrosis (sleep length, chronotype and shift work). In addition, targeting REVERB repressed collagen secretion from human fibrotic lung tissue making this protein a promising therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionTobacco smoking is a major health burden worldwide, especially in populations suffering from other substance use disorders (SUDs). Several smoking phenotypes have been associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Yet, little is known about the genetics of tobacco smoking in populations with other SUDs, particularly regarding gene-gene interactions and pleiotropy, which are likely involved in the polygenic architecture of SUDs. Thus, we undertook a candidate pathway association study of nAChR-related genes and smoking phenotypes in a sample of SUD patients.\\n\\nMethods493 patients with genetically-verified Caucasian ancestry were characterized extensively regarding patterns of tobacco smoking, other SUDs, and 83 SNPs from the nicotinic pathway, encompassing all brain nAChR subunits and metabolic/chaperone/trafficking proteins. Single-SNP, gene-based and SNP x SNP interactions analyses were performed to investigate associations with relevant tobacco smoking phenotypes. This included Bayesian analyses to detect pleiotropy, and adjustment on clinical and sociodemographic confounders.\\n\\nResultsAfter multiple adjustment, we found independent associations between CHRNA3 rs8040868 and a higher number of cigarettes per day (CPD), and between RIC3 rs11826236 and a lower age at smoking initiation. Two SNP x SNP interactions were associated with age at onset (AAO) of daily smoking. There was pleiotropy regarding three SNPs in CHRNA3 (CPD, AAO daily smoking), ACHE (CPD, HSI) and CHRNB4 (CPD, both AAOs).\\n\\nDiscussionDespite limitations, the present study shows that the genetics of tobacco smoking in SUD patients are both distinct and partially shared across smoking phenotypes, and involve metabolic and chaperone effectors of the nicotinic pathway.",

    "abstract": "Microsatellites are short tandem repeats, ubiquitous in all eukaryotes and represent [~]2% of the human genome. Among them, trinucleotide repeats are responsible for more than two dozen neurological and developmental disorders. Targeting microsatellites with dedicated DNA endonucleases could become a viable option for patients affected with dramatic neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we used the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 to induce a double-strand break within the expanded CTG repeat involved in myotonic dystrophy type 1, integrated in a yeast chromosome. Repair of this double-strand break generated unexpected large chromosomal rearrangements around the repeat tract. These rearrangements depended on RAD52, DNL4 and SAE2, and both non-homologous end-joining and single-strand annealing pathways were involved. Resection and repair of the double-strand break (DSB) were totally abolished in a rad50{Delta} strain, whereas they were impaired in a sae2{Delta} mutant, only on the DSB end containing most of the repeat tract. This proved that Sae2 plays significant different roles in resecting a DSB end containing a repeated and structured sequence as compared to a non-repeated DSB end.\\n\\nIn addition, we also discovered that gene conversion was less efficient when the DSB could be repaired using a homologous template, suggesting that the trinucleotide repeat may interfer with gene conversion too. Altogether, these data show that SpCas9 is probably not a good choice when inducing a double-strand break at or near a microsatellite, especially in mammalian genomes that contain many more dispersed repeated elements than the yeast genome.",

    "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii possesses an armada of secreted virulent factors that enable parasite invasion and survival into host cells. These factors are contained in specific secretory organelles, the rhoptries, micronemes and dense granules that release their content upon host cell recognition. Dense granules are secreted in a constitutive manner during parasite replication and play a crucial role in modulating host metabolic and immune responses. While the molecular mechanisms triggering rhoptry and microneme release upon host cell adhesion have been well studied, constitutive secretion remains a poorly explored aspect of T. gondii vesicular trafficking. Here, we investigated the role of the small GTPase Rab11A, a known regulator of exocytosis in eukaryotic cells. Our data revealed an essential role of Rab11A in promoting the cytoskeleton driven transport of DG and the release of their content into the vacuolar space. Rab11A also regulates transmembrane protein trafficking and localization during parasite replication, indicating a broader role of Rab11A in cargo exocytosis at the plasma membrane. Moreover, we found that Rab11A also regulates extracellular parasite motility and adhesion to host cells. In line with these findings, MIC2 secretion was altered in Rab11A-defective parasites, which also exhibited severe morphological defects. Strikingly, by live imaging we observed a polarized accumulation of Rab11A-positive vesicles and dense granules at the apical pole of extracellular motile parasites suggesting that a Rab11A-dependent apically polarized transport of cargo regulates parasite motility.",

    "abstract": "Acanthamoeba-infecting Mimiviridae belong to three clades: Mimiviruses (A), Moumouviruses (B) and Megaviruses (C). The uniquely complex mobilome of these giant viruses includes virophages and linear 7 kb-DNA molecules called \\\"transpovirons\\\". We recently isolated a virophage (Zamilon vitis) and two transpovirons (maBtv and mvCtv) respectively associated to B-clade and C-clade mimiviruses. We used the capacity of the Zamilon virophage to replicate both on B-clade and C-clade host viruses to investigate the three partite interaction network governing the propagation of transpovirons. We found that the virophage could transfer both types of transpovirons to B-clade and C-clade host viruses provided they were devoid of a resident transpoviron (permissive effect). If not, only the resident transpoviron was replicated and propagated within the virophage progeny (dominance effect). Although B- and C-clade viruses devoid of transpoviron could replicate both maBtv and mvCtv, they did it with a lower efficiency across clades, suggesting an ongoing process of adaptive co-evolution. We performed proteomic comparisons of host viruses and virophage particles carrying or cleared of transpovirons in search of proteins involved in this adaptation process. These experiments revealed that transpoviron-encoded proteins are synthetized during the combined mimiviruses/virophage/transpoviron replication process and some of them are specifically incorporated into the virophage and giant virus particles together with the cognate transpoviron DNA. This study also highlights a unique example of intricate commensalism in the viral world, where the transpoviron uses the virophage to propagate from one host virus to another and where the Zamilon virophage and the transpoviron depend on their host giant virus to replicate, this without affecting the giant virus infectious cycle, at least in laboratory conditions.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe Mimiviridae are giant viruses with dsDNA genome up to 1.5 Mb. They build huge viral factories in the host cytoplasm in which the nuclear-like virus-encoded functions (transcription and replication) take place. They are themselves the target of infections by 20 kb-dsDNA virophages, replicating in the giant virus factories. They can also be found associated with 7kb-DNA episomes, dubbed transpovirons. We investigated the relationship between these three players by combining competition experiments involving the newly isolated Zamilon vitis virophage as a vehicle for transpovirons of different origins with proteomics analyses of virophage and giant virus particles. Our results suggest that relationship of the virophage, the transpoviron, and their host giant virus, extend the concept of commensalism to the viral world.",

    "abstract": "Coronaviruses express a multifunctional papain-like protease, termed PLP2. PLP2 acts as a protease that cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein, and a deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme which removes ubiquitin moieties from ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Previous in vitro studies implicated PLP2 DUB activity as a negative regulator of the host interferon (IFN) response, but the role of DUB activity during virus infection was unknown. Here, we used X-ray structure-guided mutagenesis and functional studies to identify amino acid substitutions within the ubiquitin-binding surface of PLP2 that reduced DUB activity without affecting polyprotein processing activity. We engineered a DUB mutation (Asp1772 to Ala) into a murine coronavirus and evaluated the replication and pathogenesis of the DUB mutant virus (DUBmut) in cultured macrophages and in mice. We found that the DUBmut virus replicates similarly as the wild-type virus in cultured cells, but the DUBmut virus activates an IFN response at earlier times compared to the wild-type virus infection in macrophages, consistent with DUB activity negatively regulating the IFN response. We compared the pathogenesis of the DUBmut virus to the wild-type virus and found that the DUBmut-infected mice had a statistically significant reduction (p<0.05) in viral titer in livers and spleens at day 5 post-infection, albeit both wild-type and DUBmut virus infections resulted in similar liver pathology. Overall, this study demonstrates that structure-guided mutagenesis aids the identification of critical determinants of PLP2-ubiquitin complex, and that PLP2 DUB activity plays a role as an interferon antagonist in coronavirus pathogenesis.\n\nImportanceCoronaviruses employ a genetic economy by encoding multifunctional proteins that function in viral replication and also modify the host environment to disarm the innate immune response. The coronavirus papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) domain possesses protease activity, which cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein, and also DUB activity (de-conjugating ubiquitin/ubiquitin-like molecules from modified substrates) using identical catalytic residues. To separate the DUB activity from the protease activity, we employed a structure-guided mutagenesis approach and identified residues that are important for ubiquitin-binding. We found that mutating the ubiquitin-binding residues results in a PLP2 that has reduced DUB activity but retains protease activity. We engineered a recombinant murine coronavirus to express the DUB mutant and showed that the DUB mutant virus activated an earlier type I interferon response in macrophages and exhibited reduced pathogenesis in mice. The results of this study demonstrate that PLP2/DUB is an interferon antagonist and a virulence trait of coronaviruses.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveGait movies recorded in daily clinical practice are usually not filmed with specific devices, which prevents neurologists benefitting from leveraging gait analysis technologies. Here we propose a novel unsupervised approach to quantifying gait features and to extract cadence from normal and parkinsonian gait movies recorded with a home video camera by applying OpenPose, a deep learning-based 2D-pose estimator that can obtain joint coordinates from pictures or videos recorded with a monocular camera.\\n\\nMethodsOur proposed method consisted of two distinct phases: obtaining sequential gait features from movies by extracting body joint coordinates with OpenPose; and estimating cadence of periodic gait steps from the sequential gait features using the short-time pitch detection approach.\\n\\nResultsThe cadence estimation of gait in its coronal plane (frontally viewed gait) as is frequently filmed in the daily clinical setting was successfully conducted in normal gait movies using the short-time autocorrelation function (ST-ACF). In cases of parkinsonian gait with prominent freezing of gait and involuntary oscillations, using ACF-based statistical distance metrics, we quantified the periodicity of each gait sequence; this metric clearly corresponded with the subjects baseline disease statuses.\\n\\nConclusionThe proposed method allows us to analyze gait movies that have been underutilized to date in a completely data-driven manner, and might broaden the range of movies for which gait analyses can be conducted.",

All participants provided a fasted, resting blood sample and completed assessments of resting metabolic rate, body composition, muscle morphology, isometric mid-thigh pull strength, peak aerobic capacity, and a 3-minute maximal cycle ergometer sprint across two separate occasions (separated by 3-7 days). Blood samples were analyzed for testosterone, cortisol, and insulin-like growth factor-1. One-way analysis of variance revealed ADV to possess lower body fat percentage (6.7-8.3%, p = 0.007), greater bone and non-bone lean mass (12.5-26.8%, p [&le;] 0.028), muscle morphology characteristics (14.2-59.9%, p < 0.05), isometric strength characteristics (15.4-41.8%, p < 0.05), peak aerobic capacity (18.8-19.1%, p = 0.002), and anaerobic performance (15.4-51.1%, p [&le;] 0.023) compared to both REC and CON. No differences were seen between REC and CON, or between all groups for resting metabolic rate or hormone concentrations. These data suggest ADV possess several physiological advantages over REC and CON, whereas similar physiological characteristics were present in individuals who have been regularly participating in either CF or resistance and cardiovascular training for the past year.",

    "abstract": "Poultry sector contributes to four percent in national GDP of Nepal. However, this sector is under threat with periodic outbreaks of Avian Influenza (AI) subtypes H5 and H9 since 2009. This has been both a both public health threat and an economic issue. Since last three years, outbreaks of AI subtype H9 has caused huge economic losses in major poultry producing areas of Nepal. However, the risk factors associated with these outbreaks have not been assessed. A retrospective case-control study was conducted from April 2018 to May 2019 in Kathmandu Valley to understand the risk factors associated with AI subtype H9 outbreaks. Out of 100 farms selected, 50 were \\\"case\\\" farms, confirmed positive to H9 at Central Veterinary Laboratory, Kathmandu, and other 50 farms were \\\"control\\\" farms, matched for farm size and locality within a radius of three km from the case farm. Each farm was visited to collect information using semi-structured questionnaire. Nineteen potential risk factors were included in the questionnaire under the broad categories: birds and farm characteristics, management aspects and biosecurity status of the farms. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis were conducted to calculate corresponding odds ratios. Identified risk factors associated with AI subtype H9 outbreaks in Kathmandu valley were: \\\"Birds of age 31-40 days\\\" (OR= 11.31, 95% CI: 1.31-98.02, p=0.028), \\\"Older farms operating for >5 years\\\" (OR= 10.9, 95% CI: 1.76-66.93, p=0.01), \\\"Commercial layers farms\\\" (OR=36.0, 95% CI: 0.97-1332.40, p=0.052), \\\"Used stream water to water birds (OR= 5.7, 95% CI: 1.10-30.13, p=0.039)\\\", \\\"Farms without practice of fumigation after each batch of poultry (OR= 4, 95% CI: 1.44-13.13, p=0.009)., \\\"Farm with previous history of AI (OR= 13.8, 95% CI: 1.34-143.63, p = 0.028), \\\"Did not applied farm boots (OR= 2.58, 95% CI: 0.98-6.80, p= 0.055), \\\"Visitors allowed to enter the farms (OR= 2.5, 95% CI: 1.011-6.17, p = 0.047) and \\\"No foot bath at entry of farms (OR= 3.3, 95% CI: 1.29-8.38, p = 0.013). This study depicts that outbreaks of AI subtype H9 in Kathmandu valley was related to poor management practices and biosecurity in the poultry farms. We suggest improving management practices and increase biosecurity in the farms to reduce incidences of AI subtype H9 outbreaks in Kathmandu valley.",
