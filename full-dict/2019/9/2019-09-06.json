    "abstract": "Local field potential oscillations reflect temporally coordinated neuronal ensembles-- coupling distant brain regions, gating processing windows, and providing a reference for spike timing-based codes. In phase amplitude coupling (PAC), the amplitude of the envelope of a faster oscillation is larger within a phase window of a slower carrier wave. Here, we characterized PAC, and the related theta phase-referenced high gamma and beta power (PRP), in the olfactory bulb of mice learning to discriminate odorants. PAC changes throughout learning, and odorant-elicited changes in PRP increase for rewarded and decrease for unrewarded odorants. Contextual odorant identity (is the odorant rewarded?) can be decoded from peak PRP in animals proficient in odorant discrimination, but not in naive mice. As the animal learns to discriminate the odorants the dimensionality of PRP decreases. Therefore, modulation of phase-referenced chunking of information in the course of learning plays a role in early sensory processing in olfaction.\n\nSignificanceEarly processing of olfactory information takes place in circuits undergoing slow frequency theta oscillations generated by the interplay of olfactory input modulated by sniffing and centrifugal feedback from downstream brain areas. Studies in the hippocampus and cortex suggest that different information \"chunks\" are conveyed at different phases of the theta oscillation. Here we show that in the olfactory bulb, the first processing station in the olfactory system, the amplitude of high frequency gamma oscillations encodes for information on whether an odorant is rewarded when it is observed at the peak phase of the theta oscillation. Furthermore, encoding of information by the theta phase-referenced gamma oscillations becomes more accurate as the animal learns to differentiate two odorants.",

    "abstract": "Stress response is mediated by transcription of stress responsive genes. F-box motif protein Saf1 involves in SCF-E3 ligase mediated degradation of the adenine deaminase, Aah1 upon nutrient stress. Four transcription regulators, BUR6, MED6, SPT10, SUA7, have been reported for SAF1 gene in genome database of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here in this study an in-silco analysis of gene expression and transcription factor databases was carried out to understand the regulation of SAF1 gene expression during stress for hypothesis generation and experimental analysis. The GEO profile database analysis showed increased expression of SAF1 gene when treated with clioquinol, pterostilbene, gentamicin, hypoxia, genotoxic, desiccation, and heat stress, in WT cells. SAF1 gene expression in stress conditions correlated positively whereas AAH1 expression negatively with RLM1 transcription factor, which was not reported earlier. Based on analysis of expression profile and regulatory association of SAF1 and RLM1, we hypothesized that inactivation of both the genes may contribute to stress tolerance. The experimental analysis with the double mutant, saf1{Delta}rlm1{Delta} for cellular growth response to stress causing agents, showed tolerance to calcofluor white, SDS, and hydrogen peroxide. On the contrary, saf1{Delta}rlm1{Delta} showed sensitivity to MMS, HU, DMSO, Nocodazole, Benomyl stress. Based on in-silico and experimental data we suggest that SAF1 and RLM1 both interact genetically in differential response to genotoxic and general stressors.",

Although human PUM1 and PUM2 are closely related to each other and recognize the same RNA binding motif, there is some evidence for functional diversity, particularly related to their roles in fertility. Here, by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) approaches, we identified separate mRNA pools regulated by PUM1 and PUM2 proteins in human male germ cells. Using global mass spectrometry-based profiling, we identified distinct PUM1- and PUM2-bound putative protein cofactors, most of them involved in RNA processing. Combinatorial analysis of RNA-Seq and mass spectrometry findings revealed that PUM1 and PUM2 may form distinct RNA-regulatory networks, with different roles in human reproduction and testicular tumorigenesis. Our findings highlight the functional divergence and versatility of PUM paralogue-based post-transcriptional regulation, offering insight into the mechanisms underlying their diverse biological roles and diseases resulting from their dysfunction.",

The localization and formation of P granules are highly dynamic, but mechanisms that regulate such processes remain poorly understood. Here we show that germline RNA helicases (GLHs) control the formation and disassembly of germ granules through their binding and release of RNAs, respectively. In addition, the FGG repeats in the GLHs promote the formation of germ granules at the perinucleus. Proteomic analyses of a mutation that traps RNA-bound GLH-1 complex revealed transient interactions of GLH-1 with several Argonautes and RNA binding proteins. Finally, we found that defects in perinuclear P granule formation correlate with the fertility defects observed in various GLH mutants. Together, our results highlight the versatile roles of RNA helicases in controlling the formation of liquid droplets in space and time.",

The coordination of these two processes depends on the interplay between multiple hormones that determine final organ size. Using the semidominant Hairy Sheath Frayed1 (Hsf1) maize mutant, that hypersignals the perception of cytokinin (CK), we show that CK can reduce leaf size and growth rate by decreasing cell division. Linked to CK hypersignaling, the Hsf1 mutant has increased jasmonic acid (JA) content, a hormone that can inhibit cell division. Treatment of wild type seedlings with exogenous JA reduces maize leaf size and growth rate, while JA deficient maize mutants have increased leaf size and growth rate. Expression analysis revealed increased transcript accumulation of several JA pathway genes in the Hsf1 leaf growth zone. A transient treatment of growing wild type maize shoots with exogenous CK also induced JA pathway gene expression, although this effect was blocked by co-treatment with cycloheximide. Together our results suggest that CK can promote JA accumulation possibly through increased expression of specific JA pathway genes.\\n\\nOne sentence summaryCytokinin-signaling upregulates the jasmonate biosynthesis pathway, resulting in jasmonate accumulation and influences on maize leaf growth.",

    "abstract": "Macroautophagy is an evolutionarily conserved cellular process critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis. It can additionally function as an innate immune response to viral infection as has been demonstrated for a number of arthropod-borne (arbo-) viruses. Arboviruses are maintained in a transmission cycle between vertebrate hosts and invertebrate vectors yet the majority of studies assessing autophagy-arbovirus interactions have been limited to the mammalian host. Therefore we evaluated the role of autophagy during arbovirus infection of the invertebrate vector using the tractable Aag2 Aedes aegypti mosquito cell culture system. Our data demonstrates that autophagy is significantly induced in mosquito cells upon infection with two flaviviruses, dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), as well as an unrelated mosquito-borne virus, chikungunya virus (CHIKV; Togaviridae). While assessing the role of autophagy during arbovirus infection, we observed a somewhat paradoxical outcome. Both induction and suppression of autophagy via torin 1 and spautin-1, respectively, resulted in increased viral titers for all three viruses, yet suppression of autophagy-related genes had no effect. Interestingly, chemical modulators of autophagy had either no effect or opposite effects in another widely used mosquito cell line, C6/36 Aedes albopictus cells. Together, our data reveals a limited role for autophagy during arbovirus infection of mosquito cells. Further, our findings suggest that commonly used chemical modulators of autophagy alter mosquito cells in such a way as to promote viral replication; however, it is unclear if this occurs directly through autophagic manipulation or other means.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryArthropod-borne (arbo) viruses, specifically those transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, cause significant morbidity and mortality and pose a continued public health threat worldwide. Many of these viruses lack vaccines or therapeutics and current mosquito control strategies are underperforming. For these reasons, identifying vulnerabilities within the transmission cycle that can be targeted will be critical to the development of novel control interventions. Autophagy is a highly conserved cellular pathway and previous studies manipulating this pathway have shown promise in minimizing viral infections in mammalian hosts. In this study we examined arbovirus-autophagy interactions within vector mosquitoes. The goal was to elucidate the role of autophagy during infection of mosquitoes in hopes of identifying critical interactions that can be targeted by novel approaches to block infection of and transmission by vector mosquitoes.",

    "abstract": "Proprioceptive development relies on a variety of sensory inputs, among which vision is hugely dominant. Focusing on the developmental trajectory underpinning the integration of vision and proprioception, the present research explores how this integration is involved in interactions with Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) by examining how proprioceptive accuracy is affected by age, perception, and environment. Individuals from 4 to 43 years old completed a self-turning task which asked them to manually return to a previous location with different sensory modalities available in both IVR and reality. Results were interpreted from an exploratory perspective using Bayesian model comparison analysis, which allows the phenomena to be described using probabilistic statements rather than simplified reject/not-reject decisions. The most plausible model showed that 4-8-year-old children can generally be expected to make more proprioceptive errors than older children and adults. Across age groups, proprioceptive accuracy is higher when vision is available, and is disrupted in the visual environment provided by the IVR headset. We can conclude that proprioceptive accuracy mostly develops during the first eight years of life and that it relies largely on vision. Moreover, our findings indicate that this proprioceptive accuracy can be disrupted by the use of an IVR headset.",

    "abstract": "Unlike closely related GPCRs, protease-activated receptors (PAR1, PAR2, PAR3, and PAR4) have a predicted signal peptide at their N-terminus, which is encoded by a separate exon, suggesting that the signal peptides of PARs may serve an important and unique function, specific for PARs. In this report, we show that the PAR2 signal peptide, when fused to the N-terminus of IgG-Fc, effectively induced IgG-Fc secretion into culture medium, thus behaving like a classical signal peptide. The presence of PAR2 signal peptide has a strong effect on PAR2 cell surface expression, as deletion of the signal peptide (PAR2{Delta}SP) led to dramatic reduction of the cell surface expression and decreased responses to trypsin or the synthetic peptide ligand (SLIGKV). However, further deletion of the tethered ligand region (SLIGKV) at the N-terminus rescued the cell surface receptor expression and the response to the synthetic peptide ligand, suggesting that the signal peptide of PAR2 may be involved in preventing PAR2 from intracellular protease activation before reaching the cell surface. Supporting this hypothesis, an Arg36Ala mutation on PAR2{Delta}SP, which disabled the trypsin activation site, increased the receptor cell surface expression and the response to ligand stimulation. Similar effects were observed when PAR2{Delta}SP expressing cells were treated with protease inhibitors. Our findings indicated that these is a role of the PAR2 signal peptide in preventing the premature activation of PAR2 from intracellular protease cleavage before reaching the cells surface. The same mechanism may also apply to PAR1, PAR3, and PAR4.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDengue Fever (DF) is a tropical mosquito-borne disease that threatens public health and causes enormous economic burdens worldwide. In China, DF expanded from coastal region to inner land, and the incidence sharply increased in the last few years. In this study, we conduct the analysis of dengue using the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks. This is an artificial intelligence technology, to develop a precise dengue forecast model.\\n\\nMethodology/Principal FindingsThe model is developed from monthly dengue cases and local meteorological data of 2005-2018 among top 20 Chinese cities with a record of the highest dengue incidence. The first 13 year data were used to construct the LSTM and to predict the dengue outbreaks in 2018. The results are compared with the estimated dengue cases of other previously published models. Model performance and prediction accuracy were assessed using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). With the LSTM method, the prediction measurements of average RMSE drop by 54.79% and 34.76% as compared with the Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) model and Zero Inflated Generalized Additive Model (ZIGAM). Our results showed that if only local data were used to develop forecast models, the LSTM neural networks would fail to capture the transmission characteristics of dengue virus in areas with fewer dengue cases. Contrarily, transfer learning (TL) can improve the accuracy of prediction of the LSTM neural network model in areas with fewer dengue incidences.\\n\\nConclusion and significanceThe LSTM model is beneficial in predicting dengue incidence as compared with other previously published forecasting models. The findings provide a more precise forecast dengue model, which can help the local government and health-related departments respond early to dengue epidemics.\\n\\nAuthor summaryIn China, DF is a public health concern that poses a great economic burden on local governments. However, the incidence has sharply increased in recent years with growth in the sub-regions. With this issue, it will be challenging to develop an accurate and timely dengue forecast model. LSTM recurrent neural networks, deep learning methods and virus propagation rules by learning from observational data offer more advantages in predicting the prevalence of infectious disease dynamics than the traditional statistical model. The 2005-2017 data of the top 20 Chinese cities with the highest dengue incidence were used to construct the LSTM model, advantageous in predicting dengue in most cities. Moreover, the model helped to predict the dengue outbreaks in 2018 and used to compare the estimated dengue cases with the RMSE results of other previously published models. A thorough search of the literature shows that this is the first established dengue forecast model using the LSTM method, which is effective in predicting the trend of dengue dynamics.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundResistance to pyrethroid insecticides in Aedes aegypti has become widespread after almost two decades of their frequent use to reduce arbovirus transmission. Despite this, use of pyrethroids continues because they are relatively inexpensive and because of their low human toxicity. Resistance management has been proposed as a means to retain the use of pyrethroids in natural populations. A key component of resistance management assumes that there is a negative fitness associated with resistance alleles so that when insecticides are removed, resistance alleles will decline in frequency. At least three studies in Ae. aegypti have demonstrated a decrease in pyrethroid resistance once the insecticide is removed.\\n\\nMethods/Principal FindingsThe present study aims to evaluate variation in the loss of pyrethroid resistance among newly established laboratory populations of Ae. aegypti from Mexico. Eight field collections were maintained for up to eight generations and we recorded changes in the frequencies of mutations at the V1,016I locus and at the F1,534C locus in the voltage gated sodium channel (VGSC) gene. I1,016 and C1,534 confer resistance. We also examined resistance ratios (RR) with type 1 and 2 pyrethroids.\\n\\nConclusions/SignificanceWe demonstrate that, in general, the frequency of the Ae. aegypti pyrethroid resistance alleles I1,016 and C1,534 decline when they are freed from pyrethroid pressure in the laboratory. However, the pattern of decline is strain dependent. In agreement with earlier studies, RR was positively correlated with I1,016 resistant allele frequencies and showed significant protection against permethrin, and deltamethrin whereas F1534C showed protection against permethrin but not against deltamethrin.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe author is interested in the evolution of genes that confer resistance to insecticides, especially when this evolution affects binding of insecticides to their target site. The Voltage Gated Sodium Channel gene represents an excellent opportunity to understand how mutations at the target site(s) affect the evolution of resistance in many different pest insect species including Aedes aegypti, the primary vector of Dengue Virus, Yellow Fever, Zika and Chikungunya arboviruses.",

    "abstract": "The large dsDNA virus HSV-1 is often considered to be genetically stable, however it is known to rapidly evolve in response to strong selective pressures such as antiviral drug treatment. Deep sequencing analysis has revealed that clinical and laboratory isolates of this virus exist as populations that contain a mixture of minor alleles or variants, similar to many RNA viruses. Classical virology methods often used plaque-purified virus populations to demonstrate consistent genetic inheritance of viral traits. Plaque purification represents a severe genetic bottleneck which may or may not be representative of natural transmission of HSV-1. Since HSV-1 has a low error rate polymerase but exhibits substantial genetic diversity, the virus likely uses other mechanisms to generate genetic diversity, including recombination, contraction and expansion of tandem repeats, and imprecise DNA repair mechanisms. We sought to study the evolution of HSV-1 in vitro, to examine the impact of this genetic diversity in evolution, in the setting of standard laboratory conditions for viral cell culture, and in the absence of strong selective pressures. We found that a mixed population of HSV-1 was more able to evolve and adapt in culture than a plaque-purified population, though this adaptation generally occurred in a minority of the viral population. We found that certain genetic variants appeared to be positively selected for rapid growth and spread in Vero cell culture, a phenotype which was also observed in clinical samples during their first passages in culture. In the case of a minor variant that induces a visually observable syncytial phenotype, we found that changes in minor variant frequency can have a large effect on the overall phenotype of a viral population.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryHerpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a common virus, affecting over half of the adult human population, although it presents variable levels of disease burden and frequency of symptomatic recurrence. Antiviral treatments for HSV-1 infections are available, but thus far attempts at vaccine development have been foiled by insufficient immunity and/or viral escape. As a virus with a double-stranded DNA genome, HSV-1 is generally considered to be genetically stable and to have limited evolutionary potential. As these two statements are in conflict, we examined the ability of HSV-1 to evolve in a standardized cell culture setting. We utilized two HSV-1 isolates in this experiment, one with multiple viral genotypes present, which is similar to the viral populations seen in clinical settings, and one with a highly clonal viral population, which is similar to those often used in laboratory settings. After multiple rounds of replication, we analyzed the sequences of each passaged population. We found that the mixed viral population changed substantially over passage, and we were able to track specific genetic variants to phenotypic traits. By comparison, evolution in the clonal virus population was more limited. These data indicate that HSV-1 is capable of evolving rapidly, and that this evolution is facilitated by diversity in the viral population.",

    "abstract": "Microtubule is a well-known structural protein participating in cell division, motility and vesicle traffic. In this study, we found that {beta}2-tubulin, one of the microtubule components, plays an important role in regulating secondary metabolite deoxynivalenol (DON) biosynthesis in Fusarium graminearum by interacting with isocitrate dehydrogenase subunit 3 (IDH3). We found IDH3 negatively regulate DON biosynthesis by reducing acetyl-CoA accumulation in F. graminearum and DON biosynthesis was stimulated by exogenous acetyl-CoA. In addition, the expression of IDH3 significantly decreased in the carbendazim-resistant mutant nt167 (Fg{beta} F167Y). Furthermore, we found that carbendazim-resistance associated {beta}2-tubulin substitutions reducing the interaction intensity between {beta}2-tubulin and IDH3. Interestingly, we demonstrated that {beta}2-tubulin inhibitor carbendazim can disrupt the interaction between {beta}2-tubulin and IDH3. The decreased interaction intensity between {beta}2-tubulin and IDH3 resulted in the decreased expression of IDH3, which can cause the accumulation of acetyl-CoA, precursor of DON biosynthesis in F. graminearum. Thus, we revealed that carbendazim-resistance associated {beta}2-tubulin substitutions or carbendazim treatment increases DON biosynthesis by reducing the interaction between {beta}2-tubulin and IDH3 in F. graminearum. Taken together, the novel findings give the new perspectives of {beta}2-tubulin in regulating secondary metabolism in phytopathogenic fungi.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe deoxynivalenol (DON) biosynthesis is increased in carbendazim-resistant strains in Fusarium graminearum. To date, the molecular mechanism between the carbendazim-resistant substitution and the increased DON production remained elusive. Here we found that acetyl-CoA-associated enzyme IDH3 negatively regulates acetyl-CoA and DON biosynthesis. Moreover, {beta}2 tubulin interacted with IDH3 physically and increase its expression. We further found that carbendazim-resistant substitution in {beta}2 tubulin reducing the interaction between {beta}2 tubulin and IDH3, which resulted in the decreased expression of IDH3. In addition, we demonstrated that carbendazim disrupting the binding between {beta}2 tubulin and IDH3, which also decreases the expression of IDH3. Taken together, our results give a newly insights into the mechanism of {beta}2 tubulin and its carbendazim-resistant substitution in regulating DON biosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "The use of glyphosate-based herbicides is widespread and despite its extensive use, its effects are yet to be deciphered completely. The additives in commercial formulations of glyphosate, though labeled as inert when used individually, have adverse effects when used in combination with other additives and the active ingredient. As a species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a wide range of resistance to glyphosate-based herbicides. To investigate the underlying genetic differences between sensitive and resistant strains, global changes in gene expression were measured when yeast were exposed to a commercial formulation of glyphosate (CFG). Changes in gene expression involved in numerous pathways such as DNA replication, MAPK signaling, meiosis, and cell wall synthesis. Because so many diverse pathways were affected, these strains were then subjected to in-lab-evolutions (ILE) to select mutations that confer increased resistance. Common fragile sites were found to play a role in adaptation mechanisms used by cells to attain resistance with long-term exposure to CFG. The cell wall structure acts as a protective barrier in alleviating the stress caused by exposure to CFG. The thicker the cell wall, the more resistant the cell is against CFG. Hence, a detailed study of the changes occurring at the genome and transcriptome level is essential to better understand the possible effects of CFG on the cell as a whole.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryWe are exposed to various chemicals in the environment on a daily basis. Some of these chemicals are herbicides that come in direct contact with the food we consume. This makes the thorough investigation of these chemicals crucial. Some of the most commonly used herbicides around the world are glyphosate-based. Their mode of action effects a biosynthetic pathway that is absent in mammals and insects and so it is deemed safe for consumption. However, there are many additives to these herbicides that increase its effects. Thorough testing of these commercially available herbicides is essential to decipher all the potentially adverse effects that it could have on a cell. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a wide range of genetic diversity, making it is suitable to test different chemicals and identify any harmful effects. In this study, we exposed yeast cells to some glyphosate-based herbicides available in the market, to understand what effects it could have on a cell. We found that the additives in the herbicides have an effect on the cell wall and the mode of entry of glyphosate into the cell.",

    "abstract": "In many countries the publics main source of information about science and technology is the mass media. Unfortunately, in recent years traditional journalism has experienced a collapse, and science journalism has been a major casualty. One potential remedy is to encourage scientists to write for news media about science. On these general news platforms, scientists stories would have to compete for attention with other news stories on hard (e.g. politics) and entertaining (e.g. celebrity news) topics written by professional writers. Do they stand a chance?\\n\\nThis study aimed to quantitatively characterize audience interactions as an indicator of interest in science news stories authored by early career scientists (henceforth  scientists) trained to function as science reporters, as compared to news items written by reporters and published in the same news outlets.\\n\\nTo measure users behavior, we collected data on the number of clicks, likes, comments and average time spent on page. The sample was composed of 150 science items written by 50 scientists trained to contribute popular science stories in the Davidson Institute of Science Education reporters program and published on two major Israeli news websites - Mako and Ynet between July 2015 to January 2018. Each science item was paired with another item written by the websites organic reporter, and published on the same channel as the science story (e.g., tourism, health) and the same close time. Overall significant differences were not found in the publics engagement with the different items. Although, on one website there was a significant difference on two out of four engagement types, the second website did not have any difference, e.g., people did not click, like or comment more on items written by organic reporters than on the stories written by scientists. This creates an optimistic starting point for filling the science news void by scientists as science reporters.",

    "abstract": "The overall malaria burden in the Americas has decreased dramatically over the past two decades, but residual transmission pockets persist across the Amazon Basin, where Plasmodium vivax is the predominant infecting species. Current elimination efforts require a better quantitative understanding of malaria transmission dynamics for planning, monitoring, and evaluating interventions at the community level. This can be achieved with mathematical models that properly account for risk heterogeneity in communities approaching elimination, where few individuals disproportionately contribute to overall malaria prevalence, morbidity, and onwards transmission. Here we analyse demographic information combined with routinely collected malaria morbidity data from the town of Mancio Lima, the main urban transmission hotspot of Brazil. We estimate the proportion of high-risk subjects in the host population by fitting compartmental susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) transmission models simultaneously to age-stratified vivax malaria incidence densities and the frequency distribution of P. vivax malaria attacks experienced by each individual over 12 months. Simulations with the best-fitting SIS model indicate that 20% of the hosts contribute 86% of the overall vivax malaria burden. Despite the low overall force of infection typically found in the Amazon, about one order of magnitude lower than that in rural Africa, high-risk individuals gradually develop clinical immunity following repeated infections and eventually constitute a substantial infectious reservoir comprised of asymptomatic parasite carriers that is overlooked by routine surveillance but likely fuels onwards malaria transmission. High-risk individuals therefore represent a priority target for more intensive and effective interventions that may not be readily delivered to the entire community.",

    "abstract": "Parthenium hysterophorus is a noxious invasive weed and is ever expanding in its introduced range including Nepal. Understanding vegetation dynamics including soil seedbank in Parthenium invaded communities and the growth pattern of the weed itself is essential for effective management of Parthenium. We monitored growth of Parthenium (height, density, cover and soil seedbank) and plant species composition of associated species for 5-year period from 2009 in a grassland invaded by Parthenium in south-central Nepal. We found that Parthenium cover and height decreased from 2009 to 2010 and then slightly increased in 2013. Parthenium density decreased from 2009 to 2010 and then was variable until 2013. Year x grazing interactions had significant effect on Parthenium cover and density. Parthenium soil seedbank was eight times higher near the soil surface than in deep soil. It increased from 2009 to 2012 but decreased in 2013. Seedbank was also affected by interactions of year x depth, depth x grazing, and year x depth x grazing. Altogether, 87 plant species were recorded in Parthenium invaded sites and their species richness decreased until 2012 but slightly increased in 2013. The composition of associated plant species was affected by animal grazing intensity, Parthenium density, cover, and their interactions. Parthenium invasion has been ever increasing in our study site and many palatable plant species are under potential threat. Thus, there is an urgent need to carry out awareness campaign, formulate proper management plans, and implement such plans properly to manage Parthenium weed in Nepal.",

    "abstract": "Sea level is expected to rise 44 to 74 cm by the year 2100, which may have critical, previously un-investigated implications for sea turtle nesting habitat on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea. This study investigates how nesting habitat will likely be lost and altered with various increases in sea level, using global sea level rise (SLR) predictions from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Beach profiling datasets from Biokos five southern nesting beaches were used in GIS to create models to estimate habitat loss with predicted increases in sea level by years 2046-2065 and 2081-2100. The models indicate that an average of 62% of Biokos current nesting habitat could be lost by 2046-2065 and 87% by the years 2081-2100. Beach D is predicted to be the least vulnerable to increases in sea level. Erosion and tall vegetation berms have been documented on Beaches A and B, causing green turtles to nest uncharacteristically in front of the vegetation line. Development plans are currently underway for Beach D. With Beach D being the least susceptible to future increases in sea level, development and anthropogenic encroachment here would be especially detrimental to nesting turtle populations. Identified habitat sensitivities to SLR will be used to inform the government of Equatorial Guinea to consider the vulnerability of their resident turtle populations and projected climate change implications when planning for future development. To our knowledge this is the first study to predict the impacts of SLR on sea turtle nesting habitat in Africa.",

However, extracting the adjusted log odds ratio from the reported estimates of disease risk in each group is not straightforward. Here, we propose a method to transform the adjusted probability of the event in each group to the log of the odds ratio and obtain the appropriate (approximate) standard error, which can then use used in a meta-analysis.

    "abstract": "The SMC (Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes) complexes are composed of SMC dimers, kleisin and kleisin-interacting subunits. Mutual interactions of these subunits constitute the basal architecture of the SMC complexes. Particularly, terminal domains of the kleisin subunit bridge the SMC head domains of the SMC molecules. Binding of ATP molecules to the heads and their hydrolysis alter the shape of long SMC molecules (from rod-like to open-ring shapes) and power them with motor activity. The kleisin-interacting (HAWK or KITE) subunits bind kleisin linker regions and regulate such dynamic activities.\\n\\nWe developed new systems to follow the interactions between SMC5/6 subunits and stability of the SMC5/6 complexes. First, we show that the N-terminal domain of the Nse4 kleisin molecule binds to the SMC6 neck and bridges it to the SMC5 head. Second, binding of the Nse1 and Nse3 KITE proteins to the Nse4 linker part increases stability of the ATP-free SMC5/6 complex. In contrast, binding of ATP to the SMC5/6 complex containing KITE subunits significantly decreases its stability. Elongation of the Nse4 linker partially suppresses instability of the ATP-bound complex, suggesting that the binding of the KITE proteins to the Nse4 linker constrains its limited size. Our data suggest that the KITE proteins may shape the Nse4 linker to fit the ATP-free complex optimally and to facilitate opening of the complex upon ATP binding. This mechanism suggests an important role of the KITE subunits in the dynamics of the SMC5/6 complexes.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe SMC5/6 complex is member of the Structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) family, key organizers of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. Their architecture and dynamics (driven by ATP binding and hydrolysis) are essential for cellular processes, like chromatin segregation, condensation, replication and repair. In this paper, we described conserved mode of the Nse4 kleisin subunit binding to the SMC6 (similar to cohesin and condensin) and its bridging role. Furthermore, we showed different impact of the binding of the Nse1-Nse3 KITE subunits to the Nse4 kleisin bridge. Our study suggested that the KITE proteins modulate the stability of the SMC5/6 complex, depending on its binding and hydrolysis of ATP. Our findings uncover molecular mechanisms underlying dynamics of the SMC5/6 complexes.",

    "abstract": "It is widely held that clinical isolates of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) are highly cell-associated, and mutations affecting the UL128-131 and RL13 loci that arise in culture lead to the appearance of a cell-free spread phenotype. The BAC-clone Merlin (ME), expresses abundant UL128-131, is RL13-impaired and produces low infectivity virions in fibroblasts, whereas TB40/e (TB) and TR are low in UL128-131, RL13-intact and produce virions of much higher infectivity. Despite these differences, quantification of spread by flow cytometry revealed remarkably similar spread efficiencies in fibroblasts. In epithelial cells, ME spread more efficiently, consistent with robust UL128-131 expression. Strikingly, ME spread far better than TB or TR in the presence of neutralizing antibodies on both cell types, indicating that ME is not simply deficient at cell-free spread, but is particularly efficient at cell-to-cell spread, whereas TB and TR cell-to-cell spread is poor. Sonically disrupted ME-infected cells contained scant infectivity, suggesting that the efficient cell-to-cell spread mechanism of ME depends on features of the intact cells such as junctions or intracellular trafficking processes. Even when UL128-131 was transcriptional repressed, cell-to-cell spread of ME was still more efficient than TB or TR. Moreover, RL13 expression comparably reduced both cell-free and cell-to-cell spread of all three strains, suggesting that it acts at a stage of assembly and/or egress common to both routes of spread. Thus, HCMV strains can be highly specialized for either for cell-free or cell-to-cell spread and these phenotypes are determined by factors beyond the UL128-131 or RL13 loci.\n\nIMPORTANCEBoth cell-free and cell-to-cell spread are likely important for the natural biology of HCMV. In culture, strains clearly differ in their capacity for cell-free spread as a result of differences in the quantity and infectivity of extracellular released progeny. However, it has been unclear whether \"cell-associated\" phenotypes are simply the result of poor cell-free spread, or are indicative of particularly efficient cell-to-cell spread mechanisms. By measuring the kinetics of spread at early time points, we were able to show that HCMV strains can be highly specialized to either cell-free or cell-to-cell mechanisms, and this was not strictly linked the efficiency of cell-free spread. Our results provide a conceptual approach to evaluating intervention strategies for their ability to limit cell-free or cell-to-cell spread as independent processes.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion MRI of the brain enables to quantify white matter fiber orientations noninvasively. Several approaches have been proposed to estimate such characteristics from diffusion MRI data with spherical deconvolution being one of the most widely used methods. Constrained spherical deconvolution requires to define - or derive from the data - a response function, which is used to compute the fiber orientation distribution (FOD). This definition or derivation is not unequivocal and can thus result in different characteristics of the response function which are expected to affect the FOD computation and the subsequent fiber tracking. In this work, we explored the effects of inaccuracies in the shape and scaling factors of the response function on the FOD characteristics. With simulations, we show that underestimation of the shape factor in the response functions has a larger effect on the FOD peaks than overestimation of the shape factor, whereas the latter will cause more spurious peaks. Moreover, crossing fiber populations with a smaller separation angle were more sensitive to the response function inaccuracy than fiber populations with more orthogonal separation angles. Furthermore, the FOD characteristics show deviations as a result of modified shape and scaling factors of the response function. Results with the in vivo data demonstrate that the deviations of the FODs and spurious peaks can further deviate the termination of propagation in fiber tracking. This work highlights the importance of proper definition of the response function and how specific calibration factors can affect the FOD and fiber tractography results.",

Interestingly, during unrewarded foraging the gene was also found to be up-regulated, but immediately lowered as food was not rewarded. Moreover, the kakusei overexpression was diminished within a very short time when the time schedule of feeding was changed. This indicates the potential role of kakusei on the motivation of learned reward foraging, reflecting associative learning memory. These results provide evidence for a dynamic role of kakusei during foraging of bees, and eventually its possible involvement in learning and memory.

    "abstract": "Part of the oral health care in the care network encompasses users in cases of emergency. This study proposed to map the determinants of the use of dental care services within the health care network to address dental emergencies of the Brazilian Unified Health System (UHS) and to verify the main gaps in the research in this area. This is a scoping review that took place in 2018 using Andersens behavioral model as a reference. A total of 16 studies, out of 3786 original articles identified, were included and reviewed. Two reviewers independently conducted the selection process and the decision was consensually taken. The mapping of the determinants revealed a greater number of enabling factors and a larger gap in results. Greater use of the emergency service was registered by people in pain, women, adults, from an urban area, with a lower income, and less education. In future studies, primary surveys are recommended, which include all ages, analyzing different groups of needs and users that take into account the countrys northern region and the different subjects pointed out in this review.",

    "abstract": "Autoimmune regulator (AIRE) is a transcriptional regulator that is primarily expressed in medullary epithelial cells, where it induces tissue-specific antigen expression. Under pathological conditions, AIRE expression is induced in epidermal cells and promotes skin tumor development in association with stress-responsive keratin KRT17. This study aimed to clarify the role of AIRE in the pathogenesis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). AIRE expression was evaluated in seven OSCC cell lines and in OSCC tissue specimens. Transient or constitutive expression of AIRE in 293A cells induced KRT17 expression. cDNA microarray analysis of 293A cells stably expressing AIRE revealed that STAT1 and ICAM1 were significantly upregulated by AIRE. Expression of KRT17, STAT1, ICAM1, MMP9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 was elevated in 293A cells stably expressing AIRE, and conversely, was decreased in AIRE-knockout HSC3 OSCC cells when compared to the respective controls. Upregulation of KRT17, STAT1, and ICAM in OSCC cells was confirmed in tissue specimens by immunohistochemistry. We provide evidence that AIRE exerts transcriptional control in cooperation with ETS1. Expression of STAT1, ICAM1, CXCL10, and MMP9 was increased in 293A cells upon Ets1 transfection, and coexpression of AIRE resulted in enhanced expression of STAT1. AIRE coprecipitated with ETS1 in a modified immunoprecipitation assay using formaldehyde crosslinking. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative PCR analysis revealed that promoter fragments of STAT1, ICAM1, CXCL10, and MMP9 were enriched in the AIRE precipitates. In oral cancer cells, ETS1 was diffusely located in the nucleus and partially overlapped with dot-like AIRE accumulation sites. Nuclear translocation of AIRE was promoted by cotransfection with Ets1. These results indicate that AIRE is induced in OSCC and supports cancer-related gene expression in cooperation with ETS1. This is a novel function of AIRE in extrathymic tissues under the pathological condition.",

    "abstract": "The telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) is essential for genome stability and performs this role through the addition of repetitive DNA to the ends of chromosomes. The telomerase enzyme is composed of a reverse transcriptase (TERT), which utilizes a template domain in an RNA subunit (TER) to reiteratively add telomeric DNA at the ends of chromosomes. Multiple TERs have been identified in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Here we combine a phylogenetic and biochemical approach to understand how the telomerase RNP has evolved in Brassicaceae, the family that includes A. thaliana. Because of the complex phylogenetic pattern of template domain loss and alteration at the previously characterized A. thaliana TER loci, TER1 and TER2, across the plant family Brassicaceae, we bred double mutants from plants with a template deletion at AtTER1 and T-DNA insertion at AtTER2. These double mutants exhibited no telomere length deficiency, a definitive indication that neither of these loci encode a functional telomerase RNA. Moreover, we determined that the telomerase components TERT, Dyskerin, and the KU heterodimer are under strong purifying selection, consistent with the idea that the TER with which they interact is also conserved. To test this hypothesis further, we analyzed the substrate specificity of telomerase from species across Brassicaceae and determined that telomerase from close relatives bind and extend substrates in a similar manner, supporting the idea that TERs in different species are highly similar to one another and are likely encoded from an orthologous locus. Lastly, TERT proteins from across Brassicaceae were able to complement loss of function tert mutants in vivo, indicating TERTs from other species have the ability to recognize the native TER of A. thaliana. Finally, we immunoprecipitated the telomerase complex and identified associated RNAs via RNA-seq. Using our evolutionary data we constrained our analyses to conserved RNAs within Brassicaceae that contained a template domain. These analyses revealed a highly expressed locus whose disruption by a T-DNA resulted in a telomeric phenotype similar to the loss of other telomerase core proteins, indicating that the RNA has an important function in telomere maintenance.",
