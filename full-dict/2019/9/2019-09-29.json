    "abstract": "Eukaryotic communities commonly display a positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function (BEF) but the results have been mixed when assessed in bacterial communities. Habitat heterogeneity, a factor in eukaryotic BEFs, may explain these variable observations but it has not been thoroughly evaluated in bacterial communities. Here, we examined the impact of habitat on the relationship between diversity assessed based on richness, evenness, or phylogenetic diversity, and heterotrophic productivity. We sampled co-occurring free-living (more homogenous) and particle-associated (more heterogeneous) bacterial habitats in a freshwater, estuarine lake. Diversity measures, and not environmental variables, were the best predictors of particle-associated heterotrophic production. There was a strong, positive, linear relationship between particle-associated bacterial richness and heterotrophic productivity that strengthened with evenness. There were no observable BEF trends in free-living bacterial communities. Across both habitats, communities with more phylogenetically related taxa had higher per-capita heterotrophic production than communities of phylogenetically distantly related taxa. Our findings show that heterotrophic bacterial productivity is positively correlated with evenness and richness, negatively with phylogenetic diversity, and that BEF relationships are contingent on microhabitats. Our work adds to the understanding of the highly distinct contributions to community diversity and ecosystem functioning contributed by bacteria in free-living and particle-associated aquatic habitats.",

    "abstract": "Enhanced sampling methods, such as forward flux sampling (FFS), have great capacity for accelerating stochastic simulations of nonequilibrium biochemical systems involving rare events. However, the description of the tradeoffs between simulation efficiency and error in FFS remains incomplete. We present a novel and mathematically rigorous analysis of the errors in FFS that, for the first time, covers the contribution of every phase of the simulation. We derive a closed form expression for the optimally efficient count of samples to take in each FFS phase in terms of a fixed constraint on sampling error. We introduce a new method, forward flux pilot sampling (FFPilot), that is designed to take full advantage of our optimizing equation without prior information or assumptions about the phase weights and costs along the transition path. In simulations of both single- and multi-dimensional gene regulatory networks, FFPilot is able to completely control sampling error. Higher dimensional systems have additional sources of error and we show that this extra error can be traced to correlations between phases due to roughness on the probability landscape. Finally, we show that in sets of simulations with matched error, FFPilot is on the order of tens-to-hundreds of times faster than direct sampling, in a fashion that scales with the rarity of the events.",

    "abstract": "In certain neurons, zinc ions are stored in synaptic vesicles by zinc transporter 3 (ZnT3). Vesicular zinc can then be released synaptically to modulate myriad targets. In vitro evidence indicates that these targets may include brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB). But the effects of vesicular zinc on BDNF and TrkB in the intact brain are unclear. Studies of mice that lack ZnT3 - and, as a result, vesicular zinc - have shown abnormalities in BDNF and TrkB levels, but results have been mixed and are therefore difficult to interpret. This might be caused by differences in the age or sex of mice tested. In the present study, we measured BDNF and TrkB levels in the hippocampus and neocortex, comparing wild type and ZnT3 knockout mice of both sexes at two ages (5 and 12 weeks). We also examined BDNF mRNA expression and protein levels at an intermediate age (8-10 weeks). We found that, regardless of age or sex, BDNF and TrkB protein levels did not differ between wild type and ZnT3 knockout mice. There were sex-specific differences in BDNF protein and mRNA expression, however. BDNF protein levels increased with age in female mice but not in males. And in females, but not males, ZnT3 KO mice exhibited great hippocampal BDNF mRNA expression than wild type mice. We conclude that, at least in naive mice housed under standard laboratory conditions, elimination of vesicular zinc does not affect BDNF or TrkB protein levels.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide accurate identification and quantification of full-length mRNA isoforms is crucial for investigating transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of biological phenomena. Despite continuing efforts in developing effective computational tools to identify or assemble full-length mRNA isoforms from second-generation RNA-seq data, it remains a challenge to accurately identify mRNA isoforms from short sequence reads due to the substantial information loss in RNA-seq experiments. Here we introduce a novel statistical method, AIDE (Annotation-assisted Isoform DiscovEry), the first approach that directly controls false isoform discoveries by implementing the testing-based model selection principle. Solving the isoform discovery problem in a stepwise and conservative manner, AIDE prioritizes the annotated isoforms and precisely identifies novel isoforms whose addition significantly improves the explanation of observed RNA-seq reads. We evaluate the performance of AIDE based on multiple simulated and real RNA-seq datasets followed by a PCR-Sanger sequencing validation. Our results show that AIDE effectively leverages the annotation information to compensate the information loss due to short read lengths. AIDE achieves the highest precision in isoform discovery and the lowest error rates in isoform abundance estimation, compared with three state-of-the-art methods Cufflinks, SLIDE, and StringTie. As a robust bioinformatics tool for transcriptome analysis, AIDE will enable researchers to discover novel transcripts with high confidence.",

    "abstract": "The dynamics of evolution is intimately shaped by epistasis -- interactions between genetic elements which cause the fitness-effect of combinations of mutations to be non-additive. Analyzing evolutionary dynamics that involves large numbers of epistatic mutations is intrinsically difficult. A crucial feature is that the fitness landscape in the vicinity of the current genome depends on the evolutionary history. A key step is thus developing models that enable study of the effects of past evolution on future evolution. In this work, we introduce a broad class of high-dimensional random fitness landscapes for which the correlations between fitnesses of genomes are a general function of genetic distance. Their Gaussian character allows for tractable computational as well as analytic understanding. We study the properties of these landscapes focusing on the simplest evolutionary process: random adaptive (uphill) walks. Conventional measures of \"ruggedness\" are shown to not much affect such adaptive walks. Instead, the long-distance statistics of epistasis cause all properties to be highly conditional on past evolution, determining the statistics of the local landscape (the distribution of fitness-effects of available mutations and combinations of these), as well as the global geometry of evolutionary trajectories. In order to further explore the effects of conditioning on past evolution, we model the effects of slowly changing environments. At long times, such fitness \"seascapes\" cause a statistical steady state with highly intermittent evolutionary dynamics: populations undergo bursts of rapid adaptation, interspersed with periods in which adaptive mutations are rare and the population waits for more new directions to be opened up by changes in the environment. Finally, we discuss prospects for studying more complex evolutionary dynamics and on broader classes of high-dimensional landscapes and seascapes.",

    "abstract": "The information used by conscious perception may be somewhat different from that which drives certain actions. In support of this notion, recent studies reported that although internal grating motion can accumulate over seconds into a large illusory position shift, this position shift is not reflected in saccade targeting (action). Another possibility however is that rather than saccades and other actions having privileged access to the correct position, the attention shift thought to precede saccades resets the accumulated position shift to zero. Here we found that the accumulation of illusory position shift can be reset by transients near the moving object and also by the observer pressing a button at the time the object is perceived to reach a particular position. This creates a striking impression of the object jumping back to near its actual position. These results suggest that both stimulus-driven attention and attention associated with control of action may update the perceived position of moving objects and mediate the previously reported dissociation between conscious perception and saccades.",

    "abstract": "The study of intricate cellular and developmental processes in the context of complex multicellular organisms is difficult because it can require the non-destructive observation of thousands, millions, or even billions of cells deep within an animal. To address this difficulty, several groups have recently reported CRISPR-based DNA recorders that convert transient cellular experiences and processes into changes in the genome, which can then be read by sequencing in high-throughput. However, existing DNA recorders act primarily by erasing DNA: they use the random accumulation of CRISPR-induced deletions to record information. This is problematic because in the limit of progressive deletion, no record remains. Here, we present a new type of DNA recorder that acts primarily by writing new DNA. Our system, called CHYRON (Cell HistorY Recording by Ordered iNsertion), inserts random nucleotides at a single locus in temporal order in vivo and can be applied as an evolving lineage tracer as well as a recorder of user-selected cellular stimuli. As a lineage tracer, CHYRON allowed us to perfectly reconstruct the population lineage relationships among 16 groups of human cells descended from four starting groups that were subject to a series of splitting steps. In this experiment, CHYRON progressively wrote and retained base insertions in 20% percent of cells where the average amount written was 8.4 bp (~14.5 bits), reflecting high information content and density. As a stimulus recorder, we showed that when the CHYRON machinery was placed under the control of a stress-responsive promoter, the frequency and length of writing reflected the dose and duration of the stress. We believe CHYRON represents a conceptual advance in DNA recording technologies where writing rather than erasing becomes the primary mode of information accumulation. With further engineering of CHYRONs components to increase writing efficiency, CHYRON should lead to single-cell-resolution recording of lineage and other information through long periods of time in complex animals or tumors, advancing the pursuit of a full picture of mammalian development.",

Recent experiments provide glimpses of processes underpinning the transition from single cells to multicellular life and draw attention to the critical role of ecology. Here we emphasise this ecological dimension and argue that its current absence from theoretical frameworks hampers development of general explanatory solutions. Using mechanistic mathematical models, we show how a minimal ecological structure comprised of patchily distributed resources and between patch dispersal can scaffold Darwinian-like properties on collectives of cells. This scaffolding causes cells to participate directly in the process of evolution by natural selection as if they were members of multicellular collectives, with collectives participating in a death-birth process arising from the interplay between the timing of dispersal events and the rate of resource utilisation by cells. When this timescale is sufficiently long and new collectives are founded by single cells, collectives experience conditions that favour evolution of a reproductive division of labour. Together our simple model makes explicit key events in the major evolutionary transition to multicellularity. It also makes predictions concerning the life history of certain pathogens and serves as an ecological recipe for experimental realisation of evolutionary transitions.",

In congenital myelin disorders, OL dysfunction or death results in loss of myelin. This causes progressive and irreversible impairment to motor and cognitive functions, and is amongst the most disabling neurological disorder.\n\nNeonatal engraftment by glial progenitor cells (GPCs) allows the robust myelination of congenitally dysmyelinated brain, thereby preserving brain function and quality of life of patients. However, endogenous sources of glial progenitors are hard to obtain without causing secondary injury, while use of exogenous sources such as embryonic stem cells and induced-pluripotent stem cells face considerable ethical and safety issues.\n\nTo circumvent such hurdles, we asked whether NG2+ cells in the bone marrow could be a potential cell source for GPCs. We successfully generated glial progenitor cells (GPCs) from human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) from 3 donors using a 14- day induction protocol. The generated hBMSC-GPCs were highly enriched in OPC marker expression, including OLIG2, PDGFR, NG2, SOX10 and O4, and showed efficient differentiation into myelinogenic oligodendrocytes when transplanted into postnatal day 7 (P7) myelin-deficient shiverer mice. Remyelination of the shiverer mouse brain significantly extended lifespan and improved motor function.\n\nThe novel induction protocol described here provides a method for fast, simple and effective glial therapy for myelin disorders, overcoming existent hurdles of cell source restriction and time frame requirement.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=153 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/658997v8_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@104a62corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@399a67org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c81ee1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16374da_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Highlights- Human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) can be programmed to myelinating glia (GPCs, glial progenitor cells), via a novel 14-day in vitro induction protocol\n- Transplantation of these hBM-GPCs robustly remyelinated myelin deficient shiverer mice.\n- hBM-GPC transplant significantly extended lifespan, increased body weight and improved motor function",

    "abstract": "Double-hit lymphoma (DHL) is among the most aggressive and chemoresistant lymphoma subtypes. DHLs carry genomic abnormalities in MYC, BCL2 and/or BCL6 oncogenes. Due to simultaneous overexpression of these driver oncogenes, DHLs are highly resistant to the frontline therapies. Most DHLs overexpress both MYC and BCL2 driver oncogenes concurrently. We reasoned that simultaneous suppression of the two driver oncogenes would be more effective in eradicating DHLs than inactivation of single oncogene. XPO1 is a receptor for nuclear cytoplasmic transport of protein and RNA species. Recently, XPO1 inhibition was shown to downregulate MYC expression in several cancer cell lines. We therefore examined the role of XPO1 as a therapeutic target in suppressing MYC function and the potential synergistic effects of simultaneous suppression of XPO1 and BCL2 in the treatment of DHL. Here, we demonstrate that XPO1 inhibition abrogates MYC protein expression and induces massive tumor cell apoptosis. Combined use of XPO1 and BCL2 inhibitors is highly effective in eradicating DHL cells in cell culture. Notably, in a mouse model of DHL bearing primary tumor cells derived from lymphoma patients, combined treatment with XPO1 and BCL2 inhibitors blocks tumor progression, prevents brain metastasis, and extends host survival. Thus, our study confirms the simultaneous targeting of MYC and BCL2 driver oncogenes through the combined use of XPO1 and BCL2 inhibitors as a unique approach for the treatment of DHLs.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPCAPBSTRACTC_SCPCAPIn temperate forest ecosystems, the role of deer in litter decomposition, a key nutrient cycling process, remains debated. Deer may modify the decomposition process by affecting plant cover and thus modifying litter abundance. They can also alter litter quality through differential browsing and affect decomposer ability by changing soil abiotic properties and the nature of decomposer communities. We used two litterbag experiments in a quasi-experimental situation resulting from the introduction of Sitka black-tailed deer Odocoileus odocoileus sitkensis on forested islands of Haida Gwaii (Canada). We investigated the effects of deer on decomposition through their impacts on litter quality and on decomposer ability. After one year, the effect of deer on litter quality resulted in a lower rate of mass loss in litter from litterbags. This mass loss mainly reflected a 21 and 38 % lower rate of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) loss, respectively. Presence of deer resulted in lower decomposer ability for the rate of carbon loss, but not for nitrogen loss. The level of C loss after one year was 5% higher for litter decomposing on an island without deer. But the change in the rate of carbon loss explained by the effect of deer on decomposer ability was outweighed by the effect deer had on litter quality. Additional effects of deer on the decomposition process through feces deposition were significant but minor. These results question the role the large increase in deer populations observed in temperate forests at continental scales may play in broad scale patterns of C and N cycling.",

    "abstract": "We often interact with multiple people at a time and consider their various points-of-view to facilitate smooth social interaction. Yet, how our brains track multiple mental states at once, and whether skill in this domain links to navigating real-world social interactions, remains underspecified. To fill this gap, we developed a novel social working memory paradigm in which participants manage two- or four-peoples mental states in working memory, as well as control trials in which they alphabetize two- or four-peoples names in working memory. In Study 1, we found that the dorsomedial subsystem of the default network shows relative increases in activity with more mental states managed in working memory. In contrast, this subsystem shows relative decreases in activity with more non-mental state information (the number of names alphabetized) managed in working memory. In Study 2, only individual differences in managing mental states in working memory, specifically on trials that posed the greatest mental state load to working memory, correlated with social network integration. Collectively, these findings add further support to the hypothesis that social working memory relies on partially distinct brain systems and may be a key ingredient to success in a social world.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement-learning (RL) models have been pivotal to our understanding of how agents perform learning-based adaptions in dynamically changing environments. However, the exact nature of the relationship (e.g. linear, logarithmic etc.) between key components of RL models such as prediction errors (PEs; the difference between the agents expectation and the actual outcome) and learning rates (LRs; a coefficient used by agents to update their beliefs about the environment) has not been studied in detail. Here, across (i) simulations, (ii) reanalyses of readily available datasets and (iii) a novel experiment, we demonstrate that the relationship between PEs and LRs is (i) nonlinear over the PE/LR space, and (ii) it can be better accounted for by an exponential-logarithmic function that can transform the magnitude of PEs instantaneously to LRs. In line with the temporal predictions of this model, we show that physiological correlates of LRs accumulate while learners observe the outcome of their choices and update their beliefs about the environment.",

    "abstract": "Refsum disease is an inborn error of metabolism that is characterised by a defect in peroxisomal -oxidation of the branched-chain fatty acid phytanic acid. The disorder presents with late-onset progressive retinitis pigmentosa and polyneuropathy and can be diagnosed biochemically by elevated levels of phytanic acid in plasma and tissues of patients. To date, no cure exists for Refsum disease, but phytanic acid levels in patients can be reduced by plasmapheresis and a strict diet.\\n\\nIn this study, we reconstructed a fibroblast-specific genome-scale model based on the recently published, FAD-curated model, based on Recon3D reconstruction. We used transcriptomics (available via GEO database with identifier GSE138379), metabolomics, and proteomics data (available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD015518), which we obtained from healthy controls and Refsum disease patient fibroblasts incubated with phytol, a precursor of phytanic acid.\\n\\nOur model correctly represents the metabolism of phytanic acid and displays fibroblast-specific metabolic functions. Using this model, we investigated the metabolic phenotype of Refsum disease at the genome-scale, and we studied the effect of phytanic acid on cell metabolism. We identified 53 metabolites that were predicted to discriminate between Healthy and Refsum disease patients, several of which with a link to amino acid metabolism. Ultimately, these insights in metabolic changes may provide leads for pathophysiology and therapy.",

    "abstract": "Animals use behavioural cues from others to make decisions in a variety of contexts. There is growing evidence, from a range of taxa, that information about the locations of food patches can spread through a population via social connections. However, it is not known whether information about the quality of potential food sources transmits similarly. We studied foraging behaviour in a population of wild songbirds with known social associations, and tested whether flock members use social information about the profitability of patches to inform their foraging decisions. We provided artificial patches (ephemeral bird feeders) that appeared identical but were either profitable (contained food) or unprofitable (contained no food). If information about patch profitability spreads via social associations, we predicted that empty feeders would only be sampled by individuals that are less connected to each other than expected by chance. In contrast, we found that individuals recorded at empty feeders were more closely associated with each other than predicted by a null model simulating random arrival of individuals, mirroring pattern of increased connectedness among individuals recorded at full feeders. We then simulated arrival under network-based diffusion of information, and demonstrate that the observed pattern at both full and empty feeders matches predictions derived from this post-hoc model. Our results suggest that foraging songbirds only use social cues about the location of potential food sources, but not their profitability. These findings agree with the hypothesis that individuals balance the relative economic costs of using different information, where the costs of personally sampling a patch upon arrival is low relative to the cost of searching for patches. This study extends previous work on information spread through avian social networks, by suggesting important links between how animals use information at different stages of the acquisition process and the emerging population-level patterns of patch use.",

    "abstract": "Persimmon proanthocyanidin (PA) biosynthetic had been reported to be regulated by several transcription factors, but the miRNAs function involved in this process was poorly understood. We identified a miRNA858b that putatively targeted two R2R3-MYB transcription factors, DkMYB19/DkMYB20. Transcript accumulation of DkMYB19/DkMYB20 and miRNA858b showed contrasting divergent expression patterns during fruit development. DkMYB19/DkMYB20 were confirmed to be localized in the nucleus. The interaction between miRNA858b and DkMYB19/DkMYB20 were experimentally validated by 5 RNA ligase-mediated RACE and LUC enzyme activity detection. Overexpression of miRNA858b led to the down-regulation of DkMYB19/DkMYB20 which reduced the accumulation of PA, whereas the reduced miRNA858b activity that up-regulated the DkMYB19/DkMYB20 resulted in high levels of PA in STTM858b transient expression in leaves in vivo. Similarly, the transient transformation of miRNA858b in fruit wafers in vitro also reduced the accumulation of PA by repressing the DkMYB19/DkMYB20, while the up-regulation of DkMYB19/DkMYB20 enhanced the accumulation of PA in STTM858b or DkMYB19/DkMYB20 transient transformation in fruit wafers. PA content decreased after overexpression of miRNA858b in Arabidopsis wild type and DkMYB19/DkMYB20 in persimmon leaf callus consisted with the above results. These findings suggested that miRNA858b repressed the expression of DkMYB19/DkMYB20 which contribute to PA accumulation in persimmon.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint blockade of programmed death-1 (PD-1) by monoclonal antibody drugs has delivered breakthroughs in the treatment of cancer. Nonetheless, small-molecule PD-1 inhibitors could lead to increases in treatment efficacy, safety, and global access. While the ligand-binding surface of apo-PD-1 is relatively flat, it harbors a striking pocket in the murine PD-1/PD-L2 structure. An analogous pocket in human PD-1 may serve as a small-molecule drug target, but the structure of the human complex is unknown. Because the CC' and FG loops in murine PD-1 adopt new conformations upon binding PD-L2, we hypothesized that mutations in these two loops could be coupled to pocket formation and alter PD-1s affinity for PD-L2. Here, we conducted deep mutational scanning in these loops and used yeast surface display to select for enhanced PD-L2 binding. A PD-1 variant with three substitutions binds PD-L2 with an affinity two orders of magnitude higher than that of the wild-type protein, permitting crystallization of the complex. We determined the X-ray crystal structures of the human triple-mutant PD-1/PD-L2 complex and the apo triple-mutant PD-1 variant at 2.0 [A] and 1.2 [A] resolution, respectively. Binding of PD-L2 is accompanied by formation of a prominent pocket in human PD-1, as well as substantial conformational changes in the CC' and FG loops. The structure of the apo triple-mutant PD-1 shows that the CC' loop adopts the ligand-bound conformation, providing support for allostery between the loop and pocket. This human PD-1/PD-L2 structure provide critical insights for the design and discovery of small-molecule PD-1 inhibitors.\\n\\nSignificance StatementImmune checkpoint blockade of programmed death-1 (PD-1) by monoclonal antibody drugs has transformed the treatment of cancer. Small-molecule PD-1 drugs have the potential to offer increased efficacy, safety, and global access. Despite substantial efforts such small-molecule drugs have been out of reach. We identify a prominent pocket on the ligand-binding surface of human PD-1 that appears to be an attractive small-molecule drug target. The pocket forms when PD-1 is bound to one of its ligands, PD-L2. Our high-resolution crystal structure of the human PD-1/PD-L2 complex facilitates virtual drug-screening efforts and opens additional avenues for the design and discovery of small-molecule PD-1 inhibitors. Our work provides a strategy that may enable discovery of small-molecule inhibitors of other \\\"undruggable\\\" protein-protein interactions.",

In yeast, signaling mucins regulate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways that induce cell differentiation to filamentous growth (fMAPK pathway) and the response to osmotic stress (HOG pathway). To explore regulatory aspects of signaling mucin function, protein microarrays were used to identify proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic domain of the mucin-like glycoprotein, Msb2p. Eighteen proteins were identified that comprised functional categories of metabolism, actin filament capping and depolymerization, aerobic and anaerobic growth, chromatin organization and bud growth, sporulation, ribosome biogenesis, protein modification by iron-sulfur clusters, RNA catabolism, and DNA replication and DNA repair. A subunit of actin capping protein, Cap2p, interacted with the cytoplasmic domain of Msb2p. Cells lacking Cap2p showed altered localization of Msb2p and increased shedding of Msb2ps N-terminal glycosylated domain. Consistent with its role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, Cap2p, and another Msb2p-interacting protein, Aip1p, were required for the enhanced cell polarization during filamentous growth.

    "abstract": "{beta}-arrestins ({beta}arrs) critically regulate signaling and trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest family of drug targets in the human genome, and there are two isoforms of {beta}arrs: {beta}arr1 and {beta}arr2. Most GPCRs interact with both the heterotrimeric G-proteins and {beta}arrs, inducing distinct downstream signal transduction. However, certain chemokine receptors lack functional G-protein coupling, but they can efficiently recruit {beta}arrs upon agonist-stimulation, and they are referred to as atypical chemokine receptors (ACKRs). Receptor phosphorylation is a key determinant for the binding of {beta}arrs, and understanding the intricate details of receptor-{beta}arr interaction is the next frontier in GPCR structural biology. To date, the high-resolution structures of active {beta}arr1 have been revealed, but the activation mechanism of {beta}arr2 by a phosphorylated GPCR remains elusive. Here, we present a 1.95 [A] crystal structure of {beta}arr2 in complex with a phosphopeptide (C7pp) derived from the carboxyl-terminus of ACKR3, also known as CXCR7. The structure of C7pp-bound {beta}arr2 reveals key differences from the previously determined active conformation of {beta}arr1. One of the key differences is that C7pp-bound {beta}arr2 shows a relatively small inter-domain rotation. An antibody-fragment-based conformational sensor and hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments further corroborate structural features and suggest that the determined structure is an alternative active conformation of {beta}arr2.",

    "abstract": "How enzymes achieve their enormous rate enhancements remains a central question in biology, and our understanding to date has impacted drug development, influenced enzyme design, and deepened our appreciation of evolutionary processes. While enzymes position catalytic and reactant groups in active sites, physics requires that atoms undergo constant motion. Numerous proposals have invoked positioning or motions as central for enzyme function, but a scarcity of experimental data has limited our understanding of positioning and motion, their relative importance, and their changes through the enzymes reaction cycle. To examine positioning and motions and test catalytic proposals, we collected \"room temperature\" X-ray crystallography data for P. putida ketosteroid isomerase (KSI), and we obtained conformational ensembles for this and a homologous KSI from multiple PDB crystal structures. Ensemble analyses indicated limited change through KSIs reaction cycle. Active site positioning was on the 1-1.5 [A] scale, and was not exceptional compared to non-catalytic groups. The KSI ensembles provided evidence against catalytic proposals invoking oxyanion hole geometric discrimination between the ground state and transition state or highly precise general base positioning. Instead, increasing or decreasing positioning of KSIs general base reduced catalysis, suggesting optimized [A]ngstrom-scale conformational heterogeneity that allows KSI to efficiently catalyze multiple reaction steps. Ensemble analyses of surrounding groups for WT and mutant KSIs provided insights into the forces and interactions that allow and limit active site motions. Most generally, this ensemble perspective extends traditional structure-function relationships, providing the basis for a new era of \"ensemble-function\" interrogation of enzymes.",

In Drosophila, aversive olfactory LTM is optimal following spaced training, multiple trials of differential odor conditioning with rest intervals. Studies often compare memory after spaced to that after massed training, same number of trials without interval. Here we show flies acquire additional information after spaced training, forming an aversive memory for the shock-paired odor and a  safety-memory for the explicitly unpaired odor. Safety-memory requires repetition, order and spacing of the training trials and relies on specific subsets of rewarding dopaminergic neurons. Co-existence of the aversive and safety memories can be measured as depression of odor-specific responses at different combinations of junctions in the mushroom body output network. Combining two particular outputs appears to signal relative safety. Learning a complementary safety memory thereby augments LTM performance after spaced training by making the odor preference more certain.",
