    "abstract": "T cell receptor (TCR)-based therapeutic cells and agents have emerged as a new class of effective cancer therapeutics. These therapies work on cells that express intracellular cancer-associated proteins by targeting peptides displayed on major histocompatibility complex receptors. However, cross-reactivities of these agents to off-target cells and tissues have resulted in serious, sometimes fatal, adverse events. We have developed a high throughput genetic platform (termed \\\"PresentER\\\") that encodes MHC-I peptide minigenes for functional immunological assays as well as for determining the reactivities of TCR-like therapeutic agents against large libraries of MHC-I ligands. In this report, we demonstrate that PresentER can be used to identify the on-and-off targets of T cells and TCR mimic antibodies using in vitro co-culture assays or binding assays. We find dozens of MHC-I ligands that are cross-reactive with two TCR mimic antibodies and two native TCRs and that are not easily predictable by other methods.",

    "abstract": "iGluR gene family of a vertebrate, Rat and AtGLR gene family of a plant, Arabidopsis thaliana [4] perform some common functionalities in neuro-transmission, which have been compared quantitatively. Our attempt is based on the chemical properties of amino acids [6, 7, 8] comprising the primary protein sequences of the aforesaid genes. 19 AtGLR genes of length varying from 808 amino acid (aa) to 1039 aa and 16 iGluR genes length varying from 902aa to 1482 aa have been taken as data sets. Thus, we detected the commonalities (conserved elements) during the long evolution of plants and animals from a common ancestor [4]. Eight different conserved regions have been found based on individual amino acids. Two different conserved regions are also found, which are based on chemical groups of amino acids. We have tried too to find different possible patterns which are common throughout the data set taken. 9 such patterns have been found with size varying from 2 to 5 amino acids at different regions in each primary protein sequences. Phylogenetic trees of AtGLR and iGluR families have also been constructed. This approach is likely to shed light on the long course of evolution.",

    "abstract": "Context effects have been explained by either high-level cognitive processes or low-level neural adjustments but not their combination. It is currently unclear how these processes interact to shape individuals responses to context. Here, we used a large cohort of human subjects in experiments involving choice between two or three gambles in order to study the dependence of context effects on neural adaptation and individuals risk attitudes. We found no evidence that neural adaptation on long timescales (~100 trials) contributes to context effects. However, we identified two groups of subjects with distinct patterns of responses to decoys, both of which depended on individuals risk aversion. Subjects in the first group exhibited strong, consistent decoy effects and became more risk averse due to decoy presentation. In contrast, subjects in the second group did not show consistent decoy effects and became more risk seeking. The degree of change in risk aversion due to decoy presentation was positively correlated with the initial degrees of risk aversion. To explain these results and reveal underlying neural mechanisms, we developed a new model that incorporates both low- and high-level processes to fit individuals choice behavior. We found that observed decoy effects can be explained by a combination of adjustments in neural representations and competitive weighting of reward attributes, both of which depend on risk aversion but in opposite directions. Altogether, our results demonstrate how a combination of low- and high-level processes shapes multi-attribute choice, modulates overall risk preference, and explains distinct behavioral phenotypes.\n\nSignificance statementA large body of experimental work has illustrated that the introduction of a new, and often irrelevant, option can influence preference among the existing options, a phenomenon referred to as context or decoy effects. Although context effects have been explained by high-level cognitive processes--such as comparisons and competitions between attributes--or low-level adjustments of neural representations, it is unclear how these processes interact to shape individuals responses to context. Here, we show that both high-level cognitive processes and low-level neural adjustments shift risk preference during choice between multiple options but in opposite directions. Moreover, we demonstrate that a combination of these processes can account for distinct patterns of context effects in human subjects.",

    "abstract": "Vision is obtained with a continuous motion of the eyes. The kinematic analysis of eye motion, during any visual or ocular task, typically reveals two (kinematic) components: saccades, which quickly replace the visual content in the retinal fovea, and drifts, which slowly scan the image after each saccade. While the saccadic exchange of regions of interest (ROIs) is commonly considered to be included in motor-sensory closed-loops, it is commonly assumed that drifts function in an open-loop manner, that is, independent of the concurrent visual input. Accordingly, visual perception is assumed to be based on a sequence of open-loop processes, each initiated by a saccade-triggered retinal snapshot. Here we directly challenged this assumption by testing the dependency of drift kinematics on concurrent visual inputs using real-time gaze-contingent-display. Our results demonstrate a dependency of the trajectory on the concurrent visual input, convergence of speed to condition-specific values and maintenance of selected drift-related motor-sensory controlled variables, all strongly indicative of drifts being included in a closed-loop brain-world process, and thus suggesting that vision is inherently a closed-loop process.\n\nAuthor summaryOur eyes do not function like cameras; it has long been known that we are actively scanning our visual environment in order to see. Moreover, it is commonly accepted that our fast eye movements, saccades, are controlled by the brain and are affected by the sensory input. However, our slow eye movements, the ocular drifts, are often ignored when visual acquisition is analyzed. Accordingly, visual processing is typically assumed to be based on computations performed on saccade-triggered snapshots of the retinal state. Our work strongly challenges this model and provides significant evidence for an alternative model, a cybernetic one. We show that the dynamics of the ocular drifts do not allow, and cannot be explained by, open loop visual acquisition. Instead, our results suggest that visual acquisition is part of a closed-loop process, which dynamically and continuously links the brain to its environment.",

Several imaging protocols and image analysis programs exist, but they are not optimized for high-throughput, repeatable, and robust root crown phenotyping. The RhizoVision Crown platform integrates an imaging unit, image capture software, and image analysis software that are optimized for reliable extraction of measurements from large numbers of root crowns. The hardware platform utilizes a back light and a monochrome machine vision camera to capture root crown silhouettes. RhizoVision Imager and RhizoVision Analyzer are free, open-source software that streamline image capture and image analysis with intuitive graphical user interfaces. RhizoVision Analyzer was physically validated using copper wire and features were extensively validated using 10,464 ground-truth simulated images of dicot and monocot root systems. This platform was then used to phenotype soybean and wheat root crowns. A total of 2,799 soybean (Glycine max) root crowns of 187 lines and 1,753 wheat (Triticum aestivum) root crowns of 186 lines were phenotyped. Principal component analysis indicated similar correlations among features in both species. The maximum heritability was 0.74 in soybean and 0.22 in wheat, indicating differences in species and populations need to be considered. The integrated RhizoVision Crown platform facilitates high-throughput phenotyping of crop root crowns, and sets a standard by which open plant phenotyping platforms can be benchmarked.",

    "abstract": "Most research into bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) capacity for communication has centered on tonal calls termed whistles, in particular individually distinctive contact calls referred to as signature whistles. While \"non-signature\" whistles exist, and may be important components of bottlenose dolphins communicative repertoire, they have not been studied extensively. This is in part due to the difficulty of attributing whistles to specific individuals, a challenge that has limited the study of not only non-signature whistles but the study of general acoustic exchanges among socializing dolphins. In this paper, we propose the first machine-learning-based approach to identifying the source locations of semi-stationary, tonal, whistle-like sounds in a highly reverberant space, specifically a half-cylindrical dolphin pool. We deliver estimated time-difference-of-arrivals (TDOAs) and normalized cross-correlation values computed from pairs of hydrophone signals to a random forest model for high-feature-volume classification and feature selection, and subsequently deliver the selected features into linear discriminant analysis, linear and quadratic Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gaussian process models. In our 14-source-location setup, we achieve perfect accuracy in localization by classification and high accuracy in localization by regression (median absolute deviation of 0.66 m, interquartile range of 0.34 m - 1.57 m), with fewer than 10,000 features. By building a parsimonious (minimum-feature) classification tree model for the same task, we show that a minimally sufficient feature set is consistent with the information valued by a strictly geometric, time-difference-of-arrival-based approach to sound source localization. Ultimately, our regression models yielded better accuracy than the established Steered-Response Power (SRP) method when all training data were used, and comparable accuracy along the pool surface when deprived of training data at testing sites; our methods additionally boast improved computation time and the potential for superior localization accuracy in all dimensions with more training data.",

    "abstract": "Microbial metabolic interactions impact ecosystems, human health and biotechnological processes profoundly. However, their determination remains elusive, invoking an urgent need for predictive models that seamlessly integrate metabolic details with ecological and evolutionary principles which shape the interactions within microbial communities. Inspired by the evolutionary game theory, we formulated a bi-level optimization framework termed NECom for the prediction of Nash equilibria of microbial community metabolic models with significantly enhanced accuracy. NECom is free of a long hidden  forced altruism setup in previous static algorithm while allowing for  sensing and responding between microbial members that is missing in dynamic methods. We successfully predicted several classical games in the context of metabolic interactions that were falsely or incompletely predicted by existing methods, including prisoners dilemma, snowdrift game and mutualism. The results provided insights into why mutualism is favorable despite seemingly costly cross-feeding metabolites, and demonstrated the potential to predict heterogeneous phenotypes among the same species. NECom was then applied to a reported algae-yeast co-culture system that shares typical cross-feeding features of lichen, a model system of mutualism. More than 1200 growth conditions were simulated, of which 488 conditions correspond to 3221 experimental data points. Without fitting any ad-hoc parameters, an overall 63.5% and 81.7% reduction in root-mean-square error in predicted growth rates for the two species respectively was achieved when compared with the standard flux balance analysis. The simulation results further show that growth-limiting crossfeeding metabolites can be pinpointed by shadow price analysis to explain the predicted frequency-dependent growth pattern, offering insights into how stabilizing microbial interactions control microbial populations.",

    "abstract": "Many regulatory RNAs undergo changes in their structure from the dominant ground-state (GS) toward short-lived low-abundance  excited-states (ES) that reorganize local elements of secondary structure. ESs are increasingly observed in vitro and implicated in the folding and biological activities of regulatory RNAs and as targets for developing therapeutics. However, whether these ESs also form with comparable abundance within the complex cellular environment remains unknown. Here, we developed an approach for assessing the relative stability and abundance of RNA ESs within the functional cellular context. The approach uses point substitution mutations to increase the population of an inactive ES relative to the active GS. The cellular activity of such ES-stabilizing mutants then provides an indirect measure of any residual population of the active GS within the functional cellular context. Compensatory rescue mutations that restore the GS are used to control for changes in cellular activity arising due to changes in sequence. The approach is applied to probe ESs in two highly conserved and functionally important regulatory RNAs from HIV-1: the transactivation response element (TAR) and the Rev response element (RRE). For both RNAs, ES-stabilizing mutations inhibited cellular activity to a degree that correlates with the extent to which they stabilize the ES relative to the GS in vitro. These results indicate that the non-native ESs of TAR and RRE likely form in cells with abundances comparable to those measured in vitro and their targeted stabilization provides a new avenue for developing anti-HIV therapeutics.",

Here we report that, in larval zebrafish, primarily serotonergic neurons of the ventromedial caudal hypothalamus (cH) become increasingly active during food deprivation, whereas activity in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) is reduced. Exposure to food sensory and consummatory cues reverses the activity patterns of these two nuclei, consistent with their representation of opposing internal hunger states. Baseline activity is restored as food-deprived animals return to satiety via voracious feeding. The antagonistic relationship and functional importance of cH and LH activity patterns were confirmed by targeted stimulation and ablation of cH neurons. Collectively, the data allow us to propose a model in which these hypothalamic nuclei regulate different phases of hunger and satiety and coordinate energy balance via antagonistic control of distinct behavioral outputs.",

    "abstract": "Relative to individually distinctive signature whistles, little is known about the \\\"non-signature\\\" calls - particularly the non-signature whistles - of the common Atlantic bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus. While such calls are suspected to serve social function, tracking their exchange among conspecifics and correlating their usage with non-acoustic behavior has proven challenging, given both their relative scarcity in the dolphin repertoire and their characteristic shared use among dolphins, which precludes the unique identification of callers on the basis of whistle properties alone. Towards the goal of robustly identifying the callers of non-signature whistles (equivalently, attributing non-signature whistles to callers), we present a new, long-term audiovisual monitoring system designed for and tested at the Dolphin Discovery exhibit of the National Aquarium in Baltimore, Maryland. In this paper, we confirm the systems ability to spatially localize impulse-like sounds using traditional signal processing approaches that have already been used to localize dolphin echolocation clicks. We go on to provide the first rigorous experimental evaluation of the component time-difference-of-arrival-(TDOA) extraction methods on whistle-like tonal sounds in a (reverberant) aquatic environment, showing that they are generally not suited to sound localization. Nevertheless, we find that TDOA extraction under these circumstances is performed significantly better using a Generalized Cross-Correlation with Phase Transform (GCC-PHAT) method than a standard circular cross-correlation method, a potentially important result.",

Heterozygous de novo mutations in the GNAO1 gene cause NEDIM. Go, the gene product of GNAO1, is the alpha subunit of Go, a member of the heterotrimeric Gi/o family of G-proteins. Go is found abundantly throughout the brain but the pathophysiological mechanisms linking Go functions to clinical manifestations of GNAO1-related disorders are still poorly understood. One of the most common mutant alleles among the GNAO1 encephalopathies is the c.626G>A or p.Arg209His (R209H) mutation. We developed heterozygous knock-in Gnao1+/R209H mutant mice using CRISPR/Cas9 methodology to assess whether a mouse model could replicate aspects of the NEDIM clinical pattern. Mice carrying the R209H mutation exhibited increased locomotor activity and a modest gait abnormality at 8-12 weeks. In contrast to mice carrying other mutations in Gnao1, the Gnao1+/R209H mice did not show enhanced seizure susceptibility. Levels of protein expression in multiple brain regions were unchanged from WT mice but the nucleotide exchange rate of mutant R209H Go was 9 times faster than WT. The atypical neuroleptic risperidone has shown efficacy in a patient with the R209H mutation. It also alleviated the hyperlocomotion phenotype observed in our mouse model but suppressed locomotion in WT mice as well. In this study, we show that Gnao1+/R209H mice mirror elements of the patient phenotype and respond to an approved pharmacological agent.",

Here we explore the role of proteases in antibiotic tolerance, short-term population survival of antibiotics, using queueing theory (i.e. the study of waiting lines), computational models, and a synthetic biology approach. Proteases are key cellular components that degrade proteins and play an important role in a multi-drug tolerant subpopulation of cells, called persisters. We found that queueing at the protease ClpXP increases antibiotic tolerance ~80 and ~60 fold in an E. coli population treated with ampicillin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. There does not appear to be an effect on antibiotic persistence, which we distinguish from tolerance based on population decay. These results demonstrate that proteolytic queueing is a practical method to probe bacterial tolerance and related genes, while limiting the unintended consequences frequently caused by gene knockout and overexpression.",

    "abstract": "Leaf morphogenesis requires growth polarized along three axes - proximal-distal, medial-lateral and abaxial-adaxial. Grass leaves display a prominent proximal-distal (P-D) polarity consisting of a proximal sheath separated from the distal blade by the auricle and ligule. Although proper specification of the four segments is essential for normal morphology, our knowledge is incomplete regarding the mechanisms which influence P-D specification in monocots like maize (Zea mays). Here we report the identification of the gene underlying the semi-dominant, leaf patterning, maize mutant Hairy Sheath Frayed1 (Hsf1). Hsf1 plants produce leaves with outgrowths consisting of proximal segments - sheath, auricle and ligule - emanating from the distal blade margin. Analysis of three independent Hsf1 alleles revealed gain-of-function missense mutations in the ligand binding domain of the maize cytokinin (CK) receptor Zea mays Histidine Kinase1 (ZmHK1) gene. Biochemical analysis and structural modeling suggest the mutated residues near the CK binding pocket affect CK binding affinity. Treatment of wild type seedlings with exogenous CK phenocopied the Hsf1 leaf phenotypes. Results from expression and epistatic analyses indicated the Hsf1 mutant receptor appears to be hypersignaling. Our results demonstrate that hypersignaling of CK in incipient leaf primordia can reprogram developmental patterns in maize.\\n\\nSummaryIncreased cytokinin signaling in the maize Hairy Sheath Frayed1 mutant modifies leaf development leading to changes in pattering, growth and cell identity.",

    "abstract": "Accurate measurement of rice kernel sizes after milling is critical to design, develop and optimize rice milling operations. The size and mass of the individual rice kernels are important parameters typically associated with rice quality attributes, particularly head rice yield. In this study, we propose a novel methodology that combines image processing and machine learning (ML) ensemble to accurately measure the size and mass of several rice kernels simultaneously. We have developed an image processing algorithm with the help of recursive method to identify the individual rice kernels from an image and estimate the size of the kernels based on the pixels a kernel occupies. The number of pixels representing a rice kernel has been used as its digital fingerprint in order to predict its size and mass. We have employed a number of popular machine learning models to build a stacked ensemble model (SEM), which can predict the mass of the individual rice kernels based on the features derived from the pixels of the individual kernels in the image. The prediction accuracy and robustness of our image processing and SEM are quantified using uncertainty quantification. The uncertainty quantification showed 3.6%, 2.5%, and 2.4% for mean errors in estimating the kernel length of small-grain (Calhikari-202), medium-grain (Jupiter), and long-grain (CL153) rice, respectively. Similarly, mean errors associated with predicting the 1000 grain weight are 4.1%, 2.9%, and 4.3% for Calhikari-202, Jupiter, and CL153, respectively. Use of the developed algorithm in rice imaging analyzers could facilitate head rice yield quantifications and promote quicker rice quality appraisals.",

    "abstract": "Topologically associated domains (TADs) are defined as regions of self-interaction. To date, it is unclear how to reconcile TAD structure with CTCF site orientation, which is known to coordinate chromatin loops anchored by Cohesin rings at convergent CTCF site pairs. We first approached this problem by 4C analysis of the FKBP5 locus. This uncovered a CTCF loop encompassing FKBP5 but not its entire TAD. However, adjacent CTCF sites were able to form  back-up loops and these were located at TAD boundaries. We then analysed the spatial distribution of CTCF patterns along the genome together with a boundary identity conservation  gradient obtained from primary blood cells. This revealed that divergent CTCF sites are enriched at boundaries and that convergent CTCF sites mark the interior of TADs. This conciliation of CTCF site orientation and TAD structure has deep implications for the further study and engineering of TADs and their boundaries.",

    "abstract": "The advent of implantable active dense CMOS neural probes opened a new era for electrophysiology in neuroscience. These single shank electrode arrays, and the emerging tailored analysis tools, provide for the first time to neuroscientists the neurotechnology means to spatiotemporally resolve the activity of hundreds of different single-neurons in multiple vertically aligned brain structures. However, while these unprecedented experimental capabilities to study columnar brain properties are a big leap forward in neuroscience, there is the need to spatially distribute electrodes also horizontally. Closely spacing and consistently placing in well-defined geometrical arrangement multiple isolated single-shank probes is methodologically and economically impractical. Here, we present the first high-density CMOS neural probe with multiple shanks integrating thousands of closely spaced and simultaneously recording microelectrodes to map neural activity across 2D lattice. Taking advantage from the high-modularity of our electrode-pixels-based SiNAPS technology, we realized a four shanks active dense probe with 256 electrode-pixels/shank and a pitch of 28 {micro}m, for a total of 1024 simultaneously recording channels. The achieved performances allow for full-band, whole-array read-outs at 25 kHz/channel, show a measured input referred noise in the action potential band (300-7000 Hz) of 6.5 {+/-} 2.1{micro}VRMS, and a power consumption <6 {micro}W/electrode-pixel. Preliminary recordings in awake behaving mice demonstrated the capability of multi-shanks SiNAPS probes to simultaneously record neural activity (both LFPs and spikes) from a brain area >6 mm2, spanning cortical, hippocampal and thalamic regions. High-density 2D array enables combining large population unit recording across distributed networks with precise intra- and interlaminar/nuclear mapping of the oscillatory dynamics. These results pave the way to a new generation of high-density and extremely compact multi-shanks CMOS-probes with tunable layouts for electrophysiological mapping of brain activity at the single-neurons resolution.",

Bayesian methods have been developed using individual-level data to estimate multiple features of genetic architecture, including signatures of natural selection. Here, we present an enhanced method (SBayesS) that only requires GWAS summary statistics and incorporates functional genomic annotations. We analysed GWAS data with large sample sizes for 155 complex traits and detected pervasive signatures of negative selection with diverse estimates of SNP-based heritability and polygenicity. Projecting these estimates onto a map of genetic architecture obtained from evolutionary simulations revealed relatively strong natural selection on genetic variants associated with cardiorespiratory and cognitive traits and relatively small number of mutational targets for diseases. Averaging across traits, the joint distribution of SNP effect size and MAF varied across functional genomic regions (likely to be a consequence of natural selection), with enrichment in both the number of associated variants and the magnitude of effect sizes in regions such as transcriptional start sites, coding regions and 5- and 3-UTRs.",

We measured 2,925 plasma proteins from 4,331 young adults to nonagenarians and developed a novel bioinformatics approach which uncovered profound non-linear alterations in the human plasma proteome with age. Waves of changes in the proteome in the fourth, seventh, and eighth decades of life reflected distinct biological pathways, and revealed differential associations with the genome and proteome of age-related diseases and phenotypic traits.

    "abstract": "One important question in aging research is how differences in genomics and transcriptomics determine the maximum lifespan in various species. Despite recent progress, much is still unclear on the topic, partly due to the lack of samples in non-model organisms and due to challenges in direct comparisons of transcriptomes from different species. The novel ranking-based method that we employ here is used to analyze gene expression in the gray whale and compare its de novo assembled transcriptome with that of other long- and short-lived mammals. Gray whales are among the top 1% longest-lived mammals. Despite the extreme environment, or maybe due to a remarkable adaptation to its habitat (intermittent hypoxia, Arctic water, and high pressure), gray whales reach at least the age of 77 years. In this work, we show that long-lived mammals share common gene expression patterns between themselves, including high expression of DNA maintenance and repair, ubiquitination, apoptosis, and immune responses. Additionally, the level of expression for gray whale orthologs of pro- and anti-longevity genes found in model organisms is in support of their alleged role and direction in lifespan determination. Remarkably, among highly expressed pro-longevity genes many are stress-related, reflecting an adaptation to extreme environmental conditions. The conducted analysis suggests that the gray whale potentially possesses high resistance to cancer and stress, at least in part ensuring its longevity. This new transcriptome assembly also provides important resources to support the efforts of maintaining the endangered population of gray whales.",

Impaired Wnt receptor endocytosis due to loss of the ubiquitin ligase RNF43 gives rise to Wnt-hypersensitive tumours that are susceptible to anti-Wnt-based therapy. Contrary to this paradigm, we identify a class of RNF43 truncating cancer mutations that strongly induce {beta}-catenin-mediated transcription, despite exhibiting retained Wnt receptor downregulating activity. Mechanistically, these RNF43 mutants trap Casein Kinase (CK)1 at the plasma membrane, which prevents {beta}-catenin turnover and propels ligand-independent Wnt target gene transcription. When introduced in human colon stem cells, these oncogenic RNF43 mutants cooperate with p53 loss to drive a niche-independent program for self-renewal and proliferation. Importantly, onco-RNF43 mutations, unlike conventional LOF RNF43 mutations, confer resistance to anti-Wnt-based therapy. Our data demonstrate the relevance of studying patient-derived mutations for understanding disease mechanisms and improved applications of precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "In working and practical contexts, dogs rely upon their ability to discriminate a target odor from distracting odors and other sensory stimuli. Few studies have examined odor discrimination using non-behavioral methods or have approached odor discrimination from the dogs perspective. Using awake fMRI in 18 dogs, we examined the neural mechanisms underlying odor discrimination between two odors and a mixture of the odors. Neural activation was measured during the presentation of a target odor (A) associated with a food reward, a distractor odor (B) associated with nothing, and a mixture of the two odors (A+B). Changes in neural activation during the presentations of the odor stimuli in individual dogs were measured over time within three regions known to be involved with odor processing: the caudate nucleus, the amygdala, and the olfactory bulbs. Average activation within the amygdala showed that dogs maximally differentiated between odor stimuli based on the stimulus-reward associations by the first run, while activation to the mixture (A+B) was most similar to the no-reward (B) stimulus. To identify the neural representation of odor mixtures in the dog brain, we used a random forest classifier to compare multilabel (elemental) vs. multiclass (configural) models. The multiclass model performed much better than the multilabel (weighted-F1 0.44 vs. 0.14), suggesting the odor mixture was processed configurally. Analysis of the subset of high-performing dogs based on their brain classification metrics revealed a network of olfactory information-carrying brain regions that included the amygdala, piriform cortex, and posterior cingulate. These results add further evidence for the configural processing of odor mixtures in dogs and suggest a novel way to identify high-performers based on brain classification metrics.",

Alternatively, other birds may use frequency differences to segregate sound streams, and vocalizing at different frequencies may enable them to remain distinct from each other. Here, I show that conspecific Asian barbets vocalize at distinctly different peak frequencies from each other. Additionally, they also differ in repetition rate, as measured by the inter-phrase interval. However, conspecific individuals across species do not temporally coordinate with each other during vocal interactions, maintaining independent and highly stereotyped individual rhythms together with different peak frequencies. Frequency differences between individuals may facilitate sound stream segregation when calls overlap in time. I propose that frequency differences between conspecifics may be widespread among birds possessing stereotyped, repetitive calls such as those found in barbets. This may enable segregation of competing sound streams both during cooperative duets and competitive singing during territorial interactions.",

    "abstract": "O_LISocioecological theory attributes variation in social organization of female-bonded species to differences in within- and between-group competition, shaped by food distribution. Strong between-group contests are expected over large, monopolisable resources, and are not generally expected in species that feed on low quality resources distributed across large, undefended home ranges. Within groups, frequent contests are expected over discrete feeding sites but not over low-quality, dispersed resources.\nC_LIO_LIWe report on the first tests of socioecological theory, largely unexplored in non-primate species, in female Asian elephants. Asian elephants show graminivory, overlapping home ranges, and high fission-fusion dynamics, traits that are thought to be associated with infrequent contests.\nC_LIO_LIWe studied agonistic interactions within and between female elephant clans with respect to food distribution, food abundance, and competitor density effects of group size and clan density, in a grassland habitat around the Kabini backwaters, southern India.\nC_LIO_LIWe found that the Kabini grassland had three times the grass biomass as adjacent forests, and between-clan encounters were considerably higher than that known from a neighbouring forest. Individual-level agonism was also more frequent between clans than within clans. Thus, the food-rich habitat patch probably enabled strong between-clan contest competition under graminivory. Moreover, the rate of between-clan encounters increased when more clans were present, and the duration of encounters was positively related to grass biomass at the contested sites. Despite fission-fusion dynamics, within-clan agonism was also somewhat frequent, but not influenced by food distribution, in contradiction to classic socioecological predictions, possibly because of intensified competition due to high density. Interestingly, within-clan agonism increased with female group size until intermediate group sizes, suggesting that the tension between within-group and between-group competition might govern group size, since larger groups are advantageous in this strong between-clan contest regime.\nC_LIO_LIOur findings refine the current understanding of female elephant socioecology. Despite predominant graminivory and fission-fusion dynamics, within-group agonism can be frequent, especially when large groups face ecological constraints at high density. Further, frequent between-group contests may arise despite graminivory and non-territoriality when food becomes patchy and density is high. These changes may be effected by anthropogenic alteration of habitats.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "O_LIAnimals employ various foraging strategies along their ontogeny to acquire energy, and with varying degree of efficiencies, to support growth, maturation and subsequent reproduction events. Individuals that can efficiently acquire energy early are more likely to mature at an earlier age, as a result of faster energy gain which can fuel maturation and reproduction.\nC_LIO_LIWe aimed to test the hypothesis that heritable resource acquisition variation that co-varies with efficiency along the ontogeny would influence maturation timing of individuals.\nC_LIO_LITo test this hypothesis, we utilized Atlantic salmon as a model which exhibit a simple, hence trackable, genetic control of maturation age. We then monitored the variation in diet acquisition (quantified as the stomach fullness and composition) of individuals with different ages, and linked it genomic regions (haploblocks) that were previously identified to be associated with age-at-maturity.\nC_LIO_LIConsistent with the hypothesis, we demonstrated that one of the life history genomic regions tested (six6) was indeed associated with age-dependent differences in stomach fullness. Prey composition was marginally linked to both genomic regions (six6 and vgll3). We further showed Atlantic salmon switched to the so-called \"feast and famine\" strategy along the ontogeny, where older age groups exhibited heavier stomach content, but that came at the expense of running on empty more often.\nC_LIO_LIThese results suggest genetic variation underlying resource utilization variation may explain the genetic basis of age structure in Atlantic salmon. Given that ontogenetic diet has a genetic component and the strong spatial diversity associated with these genomic regions, we predict populations with diverse maturation age will have diverse evolutionary responses to future changes in marine food-web structures.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "A Staphylococcus aureus strain deleted for the c-di-AMP cyclase gene dacA is unable to survive in rich medium unless it acquires compensatory mutations. Previously identified mutations were in opuD, encoding the main glycine-betaine transporter, and alsT, encoding a predicted amino acid transporter. Here, we show that inactivation of OpuD restores the cell size of a dacA mutant to near wild-type size, while inactivation of AlsT does not, suggesting two different mechanisms for the growth rescue. AlsT was identified as an efficient glutamine transporter, indicating that preventing glutamine uptake in rich medium rescues the growth of the S. aureus dacA mutant. In addition, GltS was identified as a glutamine transporter. By performing growth curves with WT, alsT and gltS mutant strains in defined medium supplemented with ammonium, glutamine or glutamate, we revealed that ammonium and glutamine, but not glutamate promote the growth of S. aureus. This suggests that besides ammonium also glutamine can serve as a nitrogen source under these conditions. Ammonium and uptake of glutamine via AlsT inhibited c-di-AMP production, while glutamate uptake had no effect. These findings provide, besides the previously reported link between potassium and osmolyte uptake, a connection between nitrogen metabolism and c-di-AMP signalling in S. aureus.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=133 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/754309v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f6f305org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cceafeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@57cba5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fabed6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveWe assessed pre-operative structural brain networks and clinical characteristics of patients with drug resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) to identify correlates of post-surgical seizure outcome at 1 year and seizure relapses up to 5 years.\\n\\nMethodsWe retrospectively examined data from 51 TLE patients who underwent anterior temporal lobe resection (ATLR) and 29 healthy controls. For each patient, using the pre-operative structural, diffusion, and post-operative structural MRI, we generated two networks:  pre-surgery network and  surgically-spared network. The pre-surgery network is the whole-brain network before surgery and the surgically-spared network is a subnetwork of the pre-surgery network which is expected to remain unaffected by surgery and hence present post-operatively. Standardising these networks with respect to controls, we determined the number of abnormal nodes before surgery and expected to remain after surgery. We incorporated these 2 abnormality measures and 13 commonly acquired clinical data from each patient in a robust machine learning framework to estimate patient-specific chances of seizures persisting after surgery.\\n\\nResultsPatients with more abnormal nodes had lower chance of seizure freedom at 1 year and even if seizure free at 1 year, were more likely to relapse within five years. In the surgically-spared networks of poor outcome patients, the number of abnormal nodes was greater and their locations more widespread than in good outcome patients. We achieved 0.84 {+/-} 0.06 AUC and 0.89 {+/-} 0.09 specificity in detecting unsuccessful seizure outcomes at 1-year. Moreover, the model-predicted likelihood of seizure relapse was significantly correlated with the grade of surgical outcome at year-one and associated with relapses up-to five years post-surgery.\\n\\nConclusionNode abnormality offers a personalised non-invasive marker, that can be combined with clinical data, to better estimate the chances of seizure freedom at 1 year, and subsequent relapse up to 5 years after ATLR.",

    "abstract": "Patients with schizophrenia show increased striatal dopamine synthesis capacity in imaging studies. However, the mechanism underlying this is unclear but may be due to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction and parvalbumin (PV) neuronal dysfunction leading to disinhibition of mesostriatal dopamine neurons. Here, we test this in a translational mouse imaging study using a ketamine model. Mice were treated with sub-chronic ketamine (30mg/kg) or saline followed by in-vivo positron emission tomography of striatal dopamine synthesis capacity, analogous to measures used in patients. Locomotor activity was measured using the open field test. In-vivo cell-type-specific chemogenetic approaches and pharmacological interventions were used to manipulate neuronal excitability. Immunohistochemistry and RNA sequencing were used to investigate molecular mechanisms. Sub-chronic ketamine increased striatal dopamine synthesis capacity (Cohens d=2.5, P<0.001) and locomotor activity. These effects were countered by inhibition of midbrain dopamine neurons, and by activation of cortical and ventral subiculum PV interneurons. Sub-chronic ketamine reduced PV expression in these neurons. Pharmacological intervention with SEP-363856, a novel psychotropic agent with agonism at trace amine receptor 1 (TAAR1), significantly reduced the ketamine-induced increase in dopamine synthesis capacity. These results show that sub-chronic ketamine treatment in mice mimics the dopaminergic alterations in patients with psychosis, and suggest an underlying neurocircuit involving PV interneuron hypofunction in frontal cortex and hippocampus as well as activation of midbrain dopamine neurons. A novel TAAR1 agonist reversed the dopaminergic alterations suggesting a therapeutic mechanism for targeting presynaptic dopamine dysfunction in patients.",

We demonstrate improved methods for engineering the genome of the metabolically versatile and naturally transformable bacterium Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 and apply them to a genome streamlining project. In Golden Transformation, linear DNA fragments constructed by Golden Gate Assembly are directly added to cells to create targeted deletions, edits, or additions to the chromosome. We tested the dispensability of 55 regions of the ADP1 chromosome using Golden Transformation. The 19 successful multiple-gene deletions ranged in size from 21 to 183 kilobases and collectively accounted for 24.6% of its genome. Deletion success could only be partially predicted on the basis of a single-gene knockout strain collection and a new Tn-Seq experiment. We further show that ADP1s native CRISPR/Cas locus is active and can be retargeted using Golden Transformation. We reprogrammed it to create a CRISPR-Lock, which validates that a gene has been successfully removed from the chromosome and prevents it from being reacquired. These methods can be used together to implement combinatorial routes to further genome streamlining and for more rapid and assured metabolic engineering of this versatile chassis organism.",

    "abstract": "Oncogenes can generate metabolic vulnerabilities in cancer cells. Here, we tested how AKT and MYC affect the ability of cells to shift between respiration and glycolysis. Using immortalized mammary epithelial cells, we discovered that constitutively active AKT but not MYC induced cell death in galactose culture, where cells must rely on oxidative phosphorylation for energy generation. However, the negative effects of AKT were short-lived, and AKT-expressing cells recommenced growth after ~15 days in galactose. To identify the mechanisms regulating AKT-mediated cell death, we used metabolomics and found that AKT cells dying in galactose upregulated glutathione metabolism. Next, using proteomics, we discovered that AKT-expressing cells dying in galactose upregulated nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, a marker of sensitivity to oxidative stress. We therefore measured levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and discovered that galactose induced ROS in cells expressing AKT but not MYC. Additionally, ROS were required for the galactose-induced death of AKT-expressing cells. We then tested whether these findings could be replicated in breast cancer cell lines with constitutively active AKT signaling. Indeed, we found that galactose induced rapid cell death in breast cancer cell lines and that ROS were required for galactose-induced cell death. Together, our results demonstrate that AKT but not MYC induces a metabolic vulnerability in cancer cells, namely the restricted flexibility to use oxidative phosphorylation.\\n\\nImplicationsThe discovery that AKT but not MYC restricts the ability to utilize oxidative phosphorylation highlights that therapeutics targeting tumor metabolism must be tailored to the individual genetic profile of tumors.",

    "abstract": "Broad-scale plant flowering phenology data has predominantly come from geographically and taxonomically restricted monitoring networks. However, platforms such as iNaturalist, where citizen scientists upload photographs and curate identifications, provide a promising new source of data. Here we develop a general set of best practices for scoring iNaturalist digital records supporting downstream re-use in phenology studies. We focus on a case study group, Yucca, because it has showy flowers and is well documented on iNaturalist. Additionally, drivers of Yucca phenology are not well-understood despite need for Yucca to synchronize flowering with obligate moth pollinators. Finally, evidence of anomalous flowering events have been recently reported, but the extent of those events is unknown. We use best-practices approach to annotate nearly 9,000 Yucca iNaturalist records, and compare the spatiotemporal coverage of this dataset with other broad-scale monitoring resources. Our findings demonstrate that iNaturalist provides unique phenology information, including delineation of extents of unusual flowering events. We also determine if unusual early flowering events impact later, typical flowering periods. Finally, we adapt a plant phenology global knowledge-store to integrate iNaturalist annotation results, supporting broadest reuse. Our approach has application to other plant groups, leveraging rapidly increasing data resources from iNaturalist to study phenology.",

    "abstract": "Despite the fact that the cell surface receptor HVEM (TNFRSF14) appears to be implicated in the development and progression of B-cell lymphomas, its specific role in these tumours is still unclear. On the one hand, HVEM over-expression is related to worse prognosis in some types of B-cell lymphoma and other solid tumours. On the other hand, most mutations of HVEM in B-cell lymphomas are thought to promote tumour growth through the loss of function. Here, we used a CRISPR-Cas9 system to study the effect of HVEM loss on gene expression in a murine model of A20 B-cell lymphoma (belonging to the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma group). We show that loss of HVEM does not affect the doubling rate of A20 tumour cells in culture, but leads to a decrease in BTLA expression. HVEM-deficient A20 cells do not present a different pattern of metastatic dissemination to lymphoid organs compared with unmodified A20 cells. However, we observed a significant expansion of endogenous B-cells as a result of A20 tumour implantation in the thymus. Although we found no differences in the dissemination or progression of HVEM-deficient A20 cells, our results reveal that loss of HVEM alters the leukocyte recruitment capacity of A20 cells in hepatic tumour nodules at the intermediate stage of tumour development, which may be of relevance as a mechanism of immune evasion.",

    "abstract": "Hallucinogenic agents have been proposed as potent antidepressants; this includes the serotonin (5-HT) receptor 2A agonist psilocybin. In human subjects, psilocybin alters functional connectivity (FC) within the default-mode network (DMN), a constellation of inter-connected regions that is involved in self-reference and displays altered FC in depressive disorders. In this study we investigated the effects of psilocybin on FC in the analogue of the DMN in mouse, with a view to establishing an experimental animal model to investigate underlying mechanisms. Psilocybin effects were investigated in lightly-anaesthetized mice using resting-state fMRI. Dual-regression analysis identified reduced FC within the ventral striatum in psilocybin-relative to vehicle-treated mice. Refinement of the analysis using spatial references derived from both gene expression maps and viral tracer projection fields revealed two distinct effects of psilocybin: it increased FC between 5-HT-associated networks and elements of the murine DMN, thalamus, and midbrain; it decreased FC within dopamine (DA)-associated striatal networks. These results suggest that interaction between 5-HT- and DA-regulated neural networks contributes to the neural and therefore psychological effects of psilocybin. Furthermore, they highlight how information on molecular expression patterns and structural connectivity can assist in the interpretation of pharmaco-fMRI findings.",

    "abstract": "As tool compounds to study cardiac ischemia, the endogenous {delta}-opioid receptors ({delta}OR) agonist Leu5-enkephalin and the more metabolically stable synthetic peptide [D-Ala2, D-Leu5]-enkephalin are frequently employed. However, both peptides have similar pharmacological profiles that restrict detailed investigation of the cellular mechanism of the {delta}ORs protective role during ischemic events. Thus, a need remains for {delta}OR peptides with improved selectivity and unique signaling properties for investigating the specific roles for {delta}OR signaling in cardiac ischemia. To this end, we explored substitution at the Phe4 position of Leu5-enkephalin for its ability to modulate receptor function and selectivity. Peptides were assessed for their affinity to bind to {delta}ORs and -opioid receptors (ORs) and potency to inhibit cAMP signaling and to recruit {beta}-arrestin 2. Additionally, peptide stability was measured in rat plasma. Substitution of the meta-position of Phe4 of Leu5-enkephalin provided high-affinity ligands with varying levels of selectivity and bias at both the {delta}OR and OR and improved peptide stability, while substitution with picoline derivatives produced lower-affinity ligands with G protein biases at both receptors. Overall, these favorable substitutions at the meta-position of Phe4 may be combined with other modifications to Leu5-enkephalin to deliver improved agonists with finely tuned potency, selectivity, bias and drug-like properties.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=51 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/750794v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (9K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@143ee98org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e55c94org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2114b4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d63ba4_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOTOC FIGUREC_FLOATNO C_FIG",

The developed approach takes into account the bi-functional activation or inhibition nature of interactions between each pair of proteins describing it in the frame work of Ising-spin matrix transitions. We also apply a recently developed linear response theory for the Google matrix which highlights a pathway of proteins whose PageRank probabilities are most sensitive with respect to two proteins selected for the analysis. This group of proteins is analyzed by the reduced Google matrix algorithm which allows to determine the effective interactions between them due to direct and indirect pathways in the global network. We show that the dominating activation or inhibition function of each protein can be characterized by its magnetization. The results of this Google matrix analysis are presented for three examples of selected pairs of proteins.

The mode in which that perturbation occurs is still of utmost importance in areas such as reprogramming therapeutics. In this sense, the overall graph architecture is well characterise by module identification. Topological overlap-related measures make possible the localisation of highly specific module regulators that can perturb other nodes, potentially causing the entire system to change behaviour or collapse. We provide a geometric framework explaining such situations in the context of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). IBD are important chronic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract which incidence is dramatically increasing worldwide. Our approach models different IBD status as Riemannian manifolds defined by the graph Laplacian of two high throughput proteome screenings. Identifies module regulators as singularities within the manifolds (the so-called singular manifolds). And reinterprets the characteristic IBD nonlinear dynamics as compensatory responses to perturbations on those singularities. Thus, we could control the evolution of the disease status by reconfiguring particular setups of immune system to an innocuous target state.",

    "abstract": "By evolving divergent acoustic signals, sympatric assemblages of animals may minimize potentially costly masking interference. Acoustic signal space may be multidimensional, with coexisting species also vocalizing from different regions of physical space. Here, we demonstrate acoustic signal space partitioning in four sympatric species of wren-warbler (Cisticolidae, Prinia), in an Indian dry deciduous scrub habitat. We find that the breeding songs of wren-warblers are divergent from each other in multivariate parameter space, with only minimal interspecific overlap. Partitioning of signal space exerts constraints on the intraspecific diversity of acoustic signals, and each species exhibits different strategies to overcome these constraints. Two species partition intraspecific signal space into multiple note types, whereas a third exhibits intraspecific variation in repetition rate, thus supporting song diversity within a constrained acoustic space. Finally, we find that the four species also partition song perch heights, thus exhibiting separation along multiple axes of acoustic signal space. We hypothesize that divergent song perch heights may be driven by competition for higher singing perches or other ecological factors rather than signal propagation. Acoustic signal partitioning along multiple axes may therefore, we propose, arise from a combination of diverse ecological processes.",

    "abstract": "The mediobasal hypothalamus (arcuate nucleus - ARC - and median eminence - ME -) controls energy balance, growth and fertility through its ability to integrate neuronal, nutritional and hormonal signals and coordinate the behavioural, neuroendocrine and metabolic responses required for these functions. While our understanding of the neural circuits downstream from ARC neurons is rapidly progressing, little is known about the function of other cell types. Here we describe an unexpected role for oligodendrocytes (OL) of the ME in monitoring nutritional signals. We show that refeeding following an overnight fast rapidly activates oligodendrocyte differentiation and the production of new OL in the ME specifically. No changes in myelination were measured in this time-frame. However, refeeding changed the expression of OL-derived extracellular matrix proteins decorin and tenascin-R, with consistent changes in the density of local perineuronal nets. Last, we show that OLs use mTORC1 signalling, a pathway required for OL differentiation, to survey energy and protein availability, specifically in the ME. We conclude that new oligodendrocytes formed in the ME in response to nutritional signals control the access of circulating metabolic cues to ARC interoceptive neurons.",

    "abstract": "Auditory prediction error responses elicited by surprising sounds can be reliably recorded with musical stimuli that are more complex and realistic than those typically employed in EEG or MEG oddball paradigms. However, these responses are reduced as the predictive uncertainty of the stimuli increases. In this study, we investigate whether this effect is modulated by musical expertise. Magnetic mismatch negativity (MMNm) responses were recorded from 26 musicians and 24 non-musicians while they listened to low-and high-uncertainty melodic sequences in a musical multi-feature paradigm that included pitch, slide, intensity, and timbre deviants. When compared to non-musicians, musically trained participants had significantly larger pitch and slide MMNm responses. However, both groups showed comparable reductions of pitch and slide MMNm amplitudes in the high-uncertainty condition compared to the low-uncertainty condition. In a separate, behavioral deviance detection experiment, musicians were more accurate and confident about their responses than non-musicians, but deviance detection in both groups was similarly affected by the uncertainty of the melodies. In both experiments, the interaction between uncertainty and expertise was not significant, suggesting that the effect is comparable in both groups. Consequently, our results replicate the modulatory effect of predictive uncertainty on prediction error; show that it is present across different types of listeners; and suggest that expertise-related and stimulus-driven modulations of predictive precision are dissociable and independent.",

    "abstract": "Universities are increasingly evaluated, both internally and externally on the basis of their outputs. Often these are converted to simple, and frequently contested, rankings based on quantitative analysis of those outputs. These rankings can have substantial implications for student and staff recruitment, research income and perceived prestige of a university. Both internal and external analyses usually rely on a single data source to define the set of outputs assigned to a specific university. Although some differences between such databases are documented, few studies have explored them at the institutional scale and examined the implications of these differences for the metrics and rankings that are derived from them. We address this gap by performing detailed bibliographic comparisons between three key databases: Web of Science (WoS), Scopus and, the recently relaunched Microsoft Academic (MSA). We analyse the differences between outputs with DOIs identified from each source for a sample of 155 universities and supplement this with a detailed manual analysis of the differences for fifteen universities. We find significant differences between the sources at the university level. Sources differ in the publication year of specific objects, the completeness of metadata, as well as in their coverage of disciplines, outlets, and publication type. We construct two simple rankings based on citation counts and open access status of the outputs for these universities and show dramatic changes in position based on the choice of bibliographic data sources. Those universities that experience the largest changes are frequently those from non-English speaking countries and those that are outside the top positions in international university rankings. Overall MSA has greater coverage than Scopus or WoS, but has less complete affiliation metadata. We suggest that robust evaluation measures need to consider the effect of choice of data sources and recommend an approach where data from multiple sources is integrated to provide a more robust dataset.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGlobal positioning systems (GPS) and altimeters are increasingly used to monitor vertical space use by aerial species, a key aspect of their niche that we need to know to understand their ecology and conservation needs, and to manage our own use of the airspace. However, there are various sources of error in flight height data (\\\"height\\\" above ground, as opposed to \\\"altitude\\\" above a reference like the sea level): vertical error from the devices themselves, error in the ground elevation below the tracked animals, and error in the horizontal position of the animals and thus the predicted ground elevation below them.\\n\\nMethodsWe used controlled field trials, simulations, and the reanalysis of raptor case studies with state-space models to illustrate the effect of improper error management.\\n\\nResultsErrors of a magnitude of 20 meters appear in benign conditions (expected to be larger in more challenging context). These errors distort the shape of the distribution of flight heights, inflate the variance in flight height, bias behavioural state assignments, correlations with environmental covariates, and airspace management recommendations. Improper data filters such as removing all negative recorded flight height records introduce several biases in the remaining dataset, and preclude the opportunity to leverage unambiguous errors to help with model fitting. Analyses that ignore the variance around the mean flight height, e.g., those based on linear models of flight height, and those that ignore the variance inflation caused by telemetry errors, lead to incorrect inferences.\\n\\nConclusionThe state-space modelling framework, now in widespread use by ecologists and increasingly often automatically implemented within on-board GPS data processing algorithms, makes it possible to fit flight models directly to raw flight height records, with minimal data pre-selection, and to analyse the full distribution of flight heights, not just the mean. In addition to basic research about aerial niches, behaviour quantification, and environmental interactions, we highlight the applied relevance of our recommendations for airspace management and the conservation of aerial wildlife.",

To date, a variety of metabolic engineering approaches have been used to improve the productivity of CHO cells. While genetic manipulations are potentially laborious in mammalian cells, rational design of CHO cell culture medium or efficient fed-batch strategies are more popular approaches for bioprocess optimization. In this study, a genome-scale metabolic network model of CHO cells was used to design feeding strategies for CHO cells to improve monoclonal antibody (mAb) production. A number of metabolites, including threonine and arachidonate, were suggested by the model to be added into cell culture medium. The designed composition has been experimentally validated, and then optimized, using design of experiment methods. About a two-fold increase in the total mAb expression has been observed using this strategy. Our approach can be used in similar bioprocess optimization problems, in order to suggest new ways of increasing production in different cell factories.",

    "abstract": "Many tools have been developed to extract functional and mechanistic insight from bulk transcriptome profiling data. With the advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), it is in principle possible to do such an analysis for single cells. However, scRNA-seq data has characteristics such as drop-out events, low library sizes and a comparatively large number of samples/cells. It is thus not clear if functional genomics tools established for bulk sequencing can be applied to scRNA-seq in a meaningful way. To address this question, we performed benchmark studies on in silico and in vitro single-cell RNA-seq data. We included the bulk-RNA tools PROGENy, GO enrichment and DoRothEA that estimate pathway and transcription factor (TF) activities, respectively, and compared them against the tools AUCell and metaVIPER, designed for scRNA-seq. For the in silico study we simulated single cells from TF/pathway perturbation bulk RNA-seq experiments. Our simulation strategy guarantees that the information of the original perturbation is preserved while resembling the characteristics of scRNA-seq data. We complemented the in silico data with in vitro scRNA-seq data upon CRISPR-mediated knock-out. Our benchmarks on both the simulated and real data revealed comparable performance to the original bulk data. Additionally, we showed that the TF and pathway activities preserve cell-type specific variability by analysing a mixture sample sequenced with 13 scRNA-seq different protocols. Our analyses suggest that bulk functional genomics tools can be applied to scRNA-seq data, outperforming dedicated single cell tools. Furthermore we provide a benchmark for further methods development by the community.",

    "abstract": "The ventral visual stream is known to be organized hierarchically, where early visual areas processing simplistic features feed into higher visual areas processing more complex features. Hierarchical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were largely inspired by this type of brain organization and have been successfully used to model neural responses in different areas of the visual system. In this work, we aim to understand how an instance of these models corresponds to temporal dynamics of human object processing. Using representational similarity analysis (RSA) and various similarity metrics, we compare the model representations with two electroencephalography (EEG) data sets containing responses to a shared set of 72 images. We find that there is a hierarchical relationship between the depth of a layer and the time at which peak correlation with the brain response occurs for certain similarity metrics in both data sets. However, when comparing across layers in the neural network, the correlation onset time did not appear in a strictly hierarchical fashion. We present two additional methods that improve upon the achieved correlations by optimally weighting features from the CNN and show that depending on the similarity metric, deeper layers of the CNN provide a better correspondence than shallow layers to later time points in the EEG responses. However, we do not find that shallow layers provide better correspondences than those of deeper layers to early time points, an observation that violates the hierarchy and is in agreement with the finding from the onset-time analysis. This work makes a first comparison of various response features--including multiple similarity metrics and data sets--with respect to a neural network.",

    "abstract": "High trait variability among insects reflects a combination of intra- and inter-phenotype variations. Our aim was to assess if the trait distribution of body measurements can be more significantly influenced by sex (intraspecific variance) or by species (interspecific variance). To achieve this, we collected in Namibia tettigoniids belonging to two congeneric species of armoured ground crickets: Acanthoplus discoidalis (a significant pest in African croplands) and the long-legged Acanthoplus longipes. We measured in the field the total body length, the maximal pronotal width and length, and the femur and tibia lengths of the hind legs in 106 adults. We also derived the body mass from length and width values of the sampled specimens. No significant differences emerged in the two species by sex. A discriminant analysis clearly shows that at species level the locomotory traits as captured by tibia and femur lengths and the size traits as captured by body and pronotal lengths account for 99% of the total variance and clearly separate this pest from its congeneric species. In essence, it is not primarily the body size that differentiates the two species, but rather the pronotum and hind leg larger sizes of A. longipes. Different eco-ethological requirements, like the peculiarity of the calling song and the movements within the vegetation (and the consequently needed energy), independently force these functional traits.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic integration of internal and external cues is essential for flexible, adaptive animal behavior. In C. elegans, biological sex and feeding state regulate expression of the food-associated chemoreceptor odr-10, contributing to plasticity in food detection and the decision between feeding and exploration. In adult hermaphrodites, odr-10 expression is high; in well-fed adult males, odr-10 expression is low, promoting exploratory mate-searching behavior. Food-deprivation transiently activates male odr-10 expression, heightening food sensitivity and reducing food-leaving. Here, we identify a neuroendocrine feedback loop that sex-specifically regulates odr-10 in response to food deprivation. In well-fed males, insulin-like (IIS) and TGF{beta} signaling repress odr-10 expression. Upon food deprivation, odr-10 is directly activated by DAF-16/FoxO, the canonical C. elegans IIS effector. The TGF{beta} ligand DAF-7 acts upstream of IIS, and, likely because of its sexually dimorphic expression in the nervous system, links feeding to odr-10 only in males. Surprisingly, these responses to food deprivation are not triggered by internal metabolic cues, but rather by the loss of sensory signals from food. In the presence of inedible food, males become metabolically starved but express levels of odr-10 and daf-7 comparable to those of well-fed males. Further, exposing food-deprived males to inedible food is sufficient to restore low odr-10 expression. Food signals are detected by a small number of sensory neurons whose activity non-autonomously regulates daf-7 expression, IIS, and odr-10. Thus, adult C. elegans males employ a neuroendocrine feedback loop that integrates food detection and genetic sex to dynamically modulate chemoreceptor expression and sensory behavior.",

Capable of displacing Aedes aegypti populations, it adapts to cooler environments which increases its geographical range and transmission potential. There are limited control strategies for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes which is likely attributed to the lack of comprehensive biological studies on this emerging vector. To fill this void, here using RNAseq we characterized Aedes albopictus mRNA expression profiles at 47 distinct time points throughout development providing the first high-resolution comprehensive view of the developmental transcriptome of this worldwide human disease vector. This enabled us to identify several patterns of shared gene expression among tissues as well as sex-specific expression patterns. Moreover, to illuminate the similarities and differences between Aedes aegypti, a related human disease vector, we performed a comparative analysis using the two developmental transcriptomes. We identify life stages were the two species exhibited significant differential expression among orthologs. These findings provide insights into the similarities and differences between Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti mosquito biology. In summary, the results generated from this study should form the basis for future investigations on the biology of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes and provide a goldmine resource for the development of transgene-based vector control strategies.",

We describe a method to produce suitable photographs of the small intestine, process them with an ImageJ macro, FeatureCounter, which automatically locates image features potentially corresponding to adenomas, and a machine learning pipeline to identify and quantify them. Compared to a manual method, the specificity (or True Negative Rate, TNR) and sensitivity (or True Positive Rate, TPR) of this method in detecting adenomas are similarly high at about 80% and 87%, respectively. Importantly, total adenoma area measures derived from the automatically-called tumours were just as capable of distinguishing high-burden from low-burden mice as those established manually. Overall, our strategy is quicker, helps control experimenter bias and yields a greater wealth of information about each tumour, thus providing a convenient route to getting consistent and reliable results from a study.",

SMN-primed ribosomes are positioned within the first five codons of a set of mRNAs which are enriched in IRES-like sequences in the 5UTR and rare codons at the beginning of their coding sequence. Loss of SMN at early-stages of SMA induces translational defects in vivo, characterized by ribosome depletion in rare codons at the third and fifth position of the coding sequence. These positional defects cause ribosome depletion from mRNAs bound by SMN-primed ribosomes and translational impairment of proteins involved in motor neuron function and stability, including acetylcholinesterase. Thus, SMN plays a crucial role in the regulation of ribosome fluxes along mRNAs which encode proteins relevant to SMA pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Photoreceptor cell degeneration is a major cause of blindness and a considerable health burden during aging but effective therapeutic or preventive strategies have not so far become commercially available. Here we show in mouse models that signaling through the tyrosine kinase receptor KIT protects photoreceptor cells against both light-induced and inherited retinal degeneration. Upon light damage, photoreceptor cells upregulate Kit ligand (KITL) and activate KIT signaling, which in turn induces nuclear accumulation of the transcription factor NRF2 and stimulates the expression of the antioxidant gene Hmox1. Conversely, a viable Kit mutation promotes light-induced photoreceptor damage, which is reversed by experimental expression of Hmox1. Furthermore, overexpression of KITL from a viral AAV8 vector prevents photoreceptor cell death and partially restores retinal function after light damage or in genetic models of human retinitis pigmentosa. Hence, application of KITL may provide a novel therapeutic avenue for prevention or treatment of retinal degenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) research is typically conducted in controlled laboratory settings. This limits the generalizability to real-world situations. Virtual reality (VR) sits as a transitional tool that provides tight experimental control with more realistic stimuli. To test the validity of using VR for event-related potential (ERP) research we used a well-established paradigm, the oddball task. For our first study, we compared VR to traditional, monitor-based stimulus presentation using visual and auditory oddball tasks while EEG data was recorded. We were able to measure ERP waveforms typically associated with such oddball tasks, namely the P3 and earlier N2 components, in both conditions. Our results suggest that ERPs collected using VR head mounted displays and typical monitors were comparable on measures of latency, amplitude, and spectral composition. In a second study, we implemented a novel depth-based oddball task and we were able to measure the typical oddball-related ERPs elicited by the presentation of near and far stimuli. Interestingly, we observed significant differences in early ERPs components between near and far stimuli, even after controlling for the effects of the oddball task. Current results suggest that VR can serve as a valid means of stimulus presentation in novel or otherwise inaccessible environments for EEG experimentation. We demonstrated the capability of a depth-based oddball in reliably eliciting a P3 waveform. We also found an interaction between the depth at which objects are presented and early ERP responses. Further research is warranted to better explain this influence of depth on the EEG and ERP activity.",

    "abstract": "Deposition of amyloid {beta} (A{beta}) fibers in extra-cellular matrix of the brain is a ubiquitous feature associated with several neurodegenerative disorders, especially Alzheimers disease (AD). While many of the biological aspects that contribute to the formation of A{beta} plaques are well addressed at the intra- and inter-cellular level in short timescales, an understanding of how A{beta} fibrillization usually starts to dominate at a longer timescale in spite of the presence of mechanisms dedicated to A{beta} clearance, is still lacking. Furthermore, no existing mathematical model integrates the impact of diurnal neural activity as emanated from circadian regulation to predict disease progression due to a disruption in sleep-wake cycle. In this study, we develop a minimal model of A{beta} fibrillization to investigate the onset of AD over a long time-scale. Our results suggest that the diseased state is a manifestation of a phase change of the system from soluble A{beta} (sA{beta}) to fibrillar A{beta} (fA{beta}) domination upon surpassing a threshold in the production rate of soluble A{beta}. By incorporating the circadian rhythm into our model, we reveal that fA{beta} accumulation is crucially dependent on the regulation of sleep-wake cycle, thereby indicating the importance of a good sleep hygiene in averting AD onset. We also discuss potential intervention schemes to reduce fA{beta} accumulation in the brain by modification of the critical sA{beta} production rate.",

    "abstract": "Amphibian conservation in farming landscapes should address two challenges. First, to understand the relationship between landuse and amphibian habitat quality and second, to understand and support of the capacity of the local communities to continue those farming practices which supports amphibian friendly habitats. While the first challenge is addressed by several studies, there is virtually no study addressing the socio-economic drivers of landuse change. The major aim of this study to fill this knowledge gap by (i) documenting the temporary pond loss in 10 years in a traditionally managed pasture as a result of land abandonment and (ii) exploring the socio-economic and environmental drivers of abandonment. The results show a dramatic increase of scrub cover in the study area as a result of land abandonment. The formation of temporary ponds was negatively influenced by the increase of scrub cover in the vicinity of ponds. There were no differences between the amphibian species assemblages nor the species richness between the lost- and persisting ponds. The social component of the research highlights possible maladaptive paths in pasture management reinforced by the village depopulation, wrong interpretation of nature protection law by officials, scrub encroachment caused decrease in pasture quality and the demotivation of locals to restart traditional grazing. Conservation efforts in traditional farming landscapes facing land abandonment should (i) target the maximization of the quality of the remaining ponds for amphibians and (ii) should support reviving traditional farming practices within the local community.",

    "abstract": "Lipid droplets are cytoplasmic micro-scale organelles involved in energy homeostasis and handling of cellular lipids and proteins. The core structure is mainly composed of two kinds of neutral lipids, triglycerides and cholesteryl esters, which are coated by a phospholipid monolayer and proteins. Despite the liquid crystalline nature of cholesteryl esters, the connection between the lipid composition and physical states is poorly understood. Here, we present the first universal intracellular phase diagram of lipid droplets, semi-quantitatively consistent with the in vitro phase diagram, and reveal that cholesterol esters cause the liquid-liquid crystal phase transition under near-physiological conditions. The internal molecules of the liquid crystallized lipid droplets are aligned radially. We moreover combine in vivo and in vitro studies, together with the theory of confined liquid crystals, to suggest that the radial molecular alignments in intracellular lipid droplets are caused by an anchoring force at the droplet surface. Our findings on the phase transition of lipid droplets and resulting molecular organization contribute to a better understanding of their biological functions and diseases.",

    "abstract": "Processing bodies (PBs) and stress granules (SGs) are prominent examples of sub-cellular, membrane-less compartments that are observed under physiological and stress conditions, respectively. We observe that the trimeric PB protein DCP1A rapidly (within [~]10 s) phase-separates in mammalian cells during hyperosmotic stress and dissolves upon isosmotic rescue (over [~]100 s) with minimal impact on cell viability even after multiple cycles of osmotic perturbation. Strikingly, this rapid intracellular hyperosmotic phase separation (HOPS) correlates with the degree of cell volume compression, distinct from SG assembly, and is exhibited broadly by homo-multimeric (valency [&ge;] 2) proteins across several cell types. Notably, HOPS sequesters pre-mRNA cleavage factor components from actively transcribing genomic loci, providing a mechanism for hyperosmolarity-induced global impairment of transcription termination. Together, our data suggest that the multimeric proteome rapidly responds to changes in hydration and molecular crowding, revealing an unexpected mode of globally programmed phase separation and sequestration that adapts the cell to volume change.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/748293v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (46K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ef81a5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1288c1eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@107355aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3fb071_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG IN BRIEFCells constantly experience osmotic variation.

We recently demonstrated that the \"hotspot\" PIK3CAH1047R variant exerts unexpected allele dose-dependent effects on stemness in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). In the present study, we combine high-depth transcriptomics, total proteomics and reverse-phase protein arrays to reveal potentially disease-related alterations in heterozygous cells, and to assess the contribution of activated TGF{beta} signalling to the stemness phenotype of PIK3CAH1047R homozygous cells. We demonstrate signalling rewiring as a function of oncogenic PI3K signalling dose, and provide experimental evidence that self-sustained stemness is causally related to enhanced autocrine NODAL/TGF{beta} signalling. A significant transcriptomic signature of TGF{beta} pathway activation in PIK3CAH1047R heterozygous was observed but was modest and was not associated with the stemness phenotype seen in homozygous mutants. Notably, the stemness gene expression in PIK3CAH1047R homozygous iPSCs was reversed by pharmacological inhibition of TGF{beta} signalling, but not by pharmacological PI3K pathway inhibition. Altogether, this provides the first in-depth analysis of PI3K signalling in human pluripotent stem cells and directly links dose-dependent PI3K activation to developmental NODAL/TGF{beta} signalling.",

    "abstract": "Breathing air is a fundamental human need, yet its safety, when challenged by various harmful or lethal substances, is often not properly guarded. For example, air toxicity is currently monitored only for single or limited number of known toxicants, thus failing to fully warn against possible hazardous air. Here, we discovered that within minutes living rats emitted distinctive profiles of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) via breath when exposed to various airborne toxicants such as endotoxin, O3, ricin, and CO2. Compared to background indoor air, when exposed to ricin or endotoxin aerosols breath-borne VOC levels, especially that of carbon disulfide, were shown to decrease; while their elevated levels were observed for O3 and CO2 exposures. A clear contrast in breath-borne VOCs profiles of rats between different toxicant exposures was observed with a statistical significance. Differences in MicroRNA regulations such as miR-33, miR-146a and miR-155 from rats blood samples revealed different mechanisms used by the rats in combating different air toxicant challenges. Similar to dogs, rats were found here to be able to sniff against toxic air by releasing a specific breath-borne VOC profile. The discovered science opens a new arena for online monitoring air toxicity and health effects of pollutants.\n\nTOC\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=104 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/739003v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f419cdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ca1582org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4a35ceorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@128b6f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",
