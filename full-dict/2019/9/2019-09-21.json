    "abstract": "The grand ambition of theorists studying ecology and evolution is to discover the logical and mathematical rules driving the worlds biodiversity at every level from genetic diversity within species to differences between populations, communities, and ecosystems. This ambition has been difficult to realize in great part because of the complexity of biodiversity. Theoretical work has led to a complex web of theories, each having non-obvious consequences for other theories. Case in point, the recent realization that genetic diversity involves a great deal of temporal and spatial stochasticity forces theoretical population genetics to consider abiotic and biotic factors generally reserved to ecosystem ecology. This interconnectedness may require theoretical scientists to adopt new techniques adapted to reason about large sets of theories. Mathematicians have solved this problem by using formal languages based on logic to manage theorems. However, theories in ecology and evolution are not mathematical theorems, they involve uncertainty. Recent work in Artificial Intelligence in bridging logic and probability theory offers the opportunity to build rich knowledge bases that combine logics ability to represent complex mathematical ideas with probability theorys ability to model uncertainty. We describe these hybrid languages and explore how they could be used to build a unified knowledge base of theories for ecology and evolution.\\n\\ncase study you explore using the Salix tritrophic system.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveWe introduce a novel animal model of somatosensory stimulation-induced reflex seizures which generates focal seizures without causing damage to the brain.\\n\\nMethodsSpecifically, we electrically stimulated digits or forepaws of adult rats sedated with dexmedetomidine while imaging cerebral blood volume and recording neurophysiological activity in cortical area S1FL. For the recordings, we either inserted a linear probe into the D3 digit representation or we performed surface electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings.\\n\\nResultsPeripheral stimulation of a digit or the forepaw elicited seizures that were followed by a refractory period with decreased neuronal activity, or another seizure or a normal response. LFP amplitudes in response to electrical pulses during the seizures (0.28 {+/-} 0.03 mV) were higher than during normal evoked responses (0.25 {+/-} 0.05 mV) and refractory periods (0.2 {+/-} 0.08 mV). Seizures generated during the stimulation period showed prolonged after-discharges that were sustained for 20.9{+/-}1.9 s following the cessation of the stimulus. High-frequency oscillations were observed prior to and during the seizures, with amplitudes higher than those associated with normal evoked responses. The seizures were initially focal. Optical imaging of the cerebral blood volume response showed that they propagated from the onset zone to adjacent cortical areas, beyond the S1FL representation of the stimulated digit or forepaw. The spatial extent during seizures was on average 1.74 times larger during the stimulation and 4.1 times following its cessation relative to normal evoked responses. Seizures were recorded not only by probes inserted into cortex but also with ECoG arrays (24.1{+/-}5.8 seizures per rat) placed over the dura matter, indicating that the seizures were not induced by damage caused by inserting the probes to cortex. Stimulation of the forepaw elicited more seizures (18.8{+/-}8.5 seizures per rat) than stimulation of a digit (1.7{+/-}0.7). Unlike rats sedated with dexmedetomidine, rats anesthetized with urethane showed no seizures, indicating that the seizures may depend on the use of the mild sedative dexmedetomidine.\\n\\nSignificanceOur proposed animal model generates seizures induced by electrical sensory stimulation free of artifacts and brain damage. It can be used for studying the mechanisms underlying the generation and propagation of reflex seizures and for evaluating antiepileptic drugs.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIPeripheral stimulation of the rat forepaw or digits induces seizures\\nC_LIO_LISeizures are evoked with no direct application of convulsants, electro-stimulation or damage to the brain\\nC_LIO_LISeizures are focal at onset, then spread beyond the spatial representation of the digit or forepaw\\nC_LIO_LISeizures persist following the cessation of the stimulus\\nC_LIO_LIProposed animal model may support the study of reflex seizures and improving therapeutic interventions\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Biological methane cycling plays an important role in Earths climate and the global carbon cycle, with biological methane oxidation (methanotrophy) modulating methane release from numerous environments including soils, sediments, and water columns. Methanotrophy is typically coupled to aerobic respiration or anaerobically via the reduction of sulfate, nitrate, or metal oxides, and while the possibility of coupling methane oxidation to phototrophy (photomethanotrophy) has been proposed, no organism has ever been described that is capable of this metabolism. Here we described a new bacterial genome from a member of the Chloroflexi phylum--termed here Candidatus Chlorolinea photomethanotrophicum--with cooccurring methanotrophy and phototrophy pathways, suggesting a novel link between these two metabolisms. Recovered as a metagenome-assembled genome from microbial mats in an iron-rich hot spring in Japan, Ca.  C. photomethanotrophicum forms a new lineage within the Chloroflexi phylum and expands the known metabolic diversity of this already diverse clade. Ca.  C. photomethanotrophicum appears to be metabolically versatile, capable of phototrophy (via a Type 2 reaction center), aerobic respiration, nitrite reduction, oxidation of methane and carbon monoxide, and potentially carbon fixation via a novel pathway composed of hybridized components of the serine cycle and the 3-hydroxypropionate bicycle. The biochemical network of this organism is constructed from components from multiple organisms and pathways, further demonstrating the modular nature of metabolic machinery and the ecological and evolutionary importance of horizontal gene transfer in the establishment of novel pathways.\n\nSignificanceMethane is a major greenhouse gas, and the production and consumption of methane is largely driven by the metabolism of microorganisms. Although it has been hypothesized for decades that some bacteria may be capable of growth by eating methane and conserving energy from sunlight (photomethanotrophy), this metabolism has never been discovered in nature. Here, we describe the first genetic evidence for a bacterium capable of photomethanotrophy, adding a new pathway to the known diversity of how microbes can make a living. This discovery also adds a new link to the global carbon cycle, and may provide new opportunities for designing biotechnological tools for processing methane.",

    "abstract": "MotivationMany methods have been developed to cluster genes on the basis of their changes in mRNA expression over time, using bulk RNA-seq or microarray data. However, single-cell data may present a particular challenge for these algorithms, since the temporal ordering of cells is not directly observed. One way to address this is to first use pseudotime methods to order the cells, and then apply clustering techniques for time course data. However, pseudotime estimates are subject to high levels of uncertainty, and failing to account for this uncertainty is liable to lead to erroneous and/or over-confident gene clusters.\\n\\nResultsThe proposed method, GPseudoClust, is a novel approach that jointly infers pseudotem-poral ordering and gene clusters, and quantifies the uncertainty in both. GPseudoClust combines a recent method for pseudotime inference with nonparametric Bayesian clustering methods, efficient MCMC sampling, and novel subsampling strategies which aid computation. We consider a broad array of simulated and experimental datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of GPseudoClust in a range of settings.\\n\\nAvailabilityAn implementation is available on GitHub: https://github.com/magStra/nonparametricSummaryPSM and https://github.com/magStra/GPseudoClust.\\n\\nContactms58@sanger.ac.uk\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary materials are available.",

    "abstract": "The genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been widely used as an experimental design to detect associations between genetic variants and a phenotype. Two major confounding factors, population stratification and relatedness, could potentially lead to inflated GWAS test-statistics and thereby spurious associations. Mixed linear model (MLM)-based approaches can be used to account for sample structure. However, genome-wide association (GWA) analyses in biobank samples such as the UK Biobank (UKB) often exceed the capability of most existing MLM-based tools especially if the number of traits is large. Here, we developed an MLM-based tool (called fastGWA) that controls for population stratification by principal components and relatedness by a sparse genetic relationship matrix for GWA analyses of biobank-scale data. We demonstrated by extensive simulations that fastGWA is reliable, robust and highly resource-efficient. We then applied fastGWA to 2,173 traits on 456,422 array-genotyped and imputed individuals and 2,048 traits on 46,191 whole-exome-sequenced individuals in the UKB.",

    "abstract": "Oncogenesis rewires signaling networks to confer a fitness advantage to malignant cells. For instance, the B16F0 melanoma cell model creates a cytokine sink for Interleukin-12 (IL-12) to deprive neighboring cells of this important anti-tumor immune signal. While a cytokine sink provides an indirect fitness advantage, does IL-12 provide an intrinsic advantage to B16F0 cells? Functionally, stimulation with IL-12 enhanced B16F0 cell survival but not normal Melan-A melanocytes that were challenged with a cytotoxic agent. To identify a mechanism, we assayed the phosphorylation of proteins involved in canonical IL-12 signaling, STAT4, and cell survival, Akt. In contrast to T cells that exhibited a canonical response to IL-12 by phosphorylating STAT4, IL-12 stimulation of B16F0 cells predominantly phosphorylated Akt. Mechanistically, the differential response in B16F0 cells is explained by both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent aspects to initiate PI3K-AKT signaling upon IL12RB2 homodimerization. Namely, IL-12 promotes IL12RB2 homodimerization with low affinity and IL12RB2 overexpression promotes homodimerization via molecular crowding on the plasma membrane. Collectively, the data suggest that B16F0 cells shifted the intra-cellular response to IL-12 from engaging immune surveillance to favoring cell survival. Identifying how signaling networks are rewired in model systems of spontaneous origin can inspire therapeutic strategies in humans.\n\nStatement of SignificanceWhile Interleukin-12 is a key cytokine that promotes anti-tumor immunity, thinking of cancer as an evolutionary process implies that an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment could arise during oncogenesis by interfering with endogenous anti-tumor immune signals, like IL-12. Previously, we found that B16F0 cells, a cell line derived from a spontaneous melanoma, interrupts this heterocellular signal by sequestering IL-12, which provides an indirect fitness advantage. Here, we report that B16F0 cells gain an intrinsic advantage by rewiring the canonical response to IL-12 to instead initiate PI3K-AKT signaling, which promotes cell survival. The data suggest a model where overexpressing one component of the IL-12 receptor, IL12RB2, enables melanoma cells to shift the functional response via both IL-12-mediated and molecular crowding-based IL12RB2 homodimerization.",

    "abstract": "Most protein encoding genes in eukaryotes contain introns which are interwoven with exons. After transcription, introns need to be removed in order to generate the final mRNA which can be translated into an amino acid sequence. Precise excision of introns by the spliceosome requires conserved dinucleotides which mark the splice sites. However, there are variations of the highly conserved combination of GT at the 5 end and AG at the 3 end of an intron in the genome. GC-AG and AT-AC are two major non-canonical splice site combinations which have been known for years. During the last years, various minor non-canonical splice site combinations were detected with numerous dinucleotide permutations. Here we expand systematic investigations of non-canonical splice site combinations in plants to all eukaryotes by analysing fungal and animal genome sequences. Comparisons of splice site combinations between these three kingdoms revealed several differences such as a substantially increased CT-AC frequency in fungal genome sequences. Canonical GT-AG splice site combinations in antisense transcripts could be one explanation for this observation. In addition, high numbers of GA-AG splice site combinations were observed in Eurytemora affinis and Oikopleura dioica. A variant in one U1 snRNA isoform might allow the recognition of GA as 5 splice site. In depth investigation of splice site usage based on RNA-Seq read mappings indicates a generally higher flexibility of the 3 splice site compared to the 5 splice site across animals, fungi, and plants.",

However, no studies have investigated pan-cancer pleiotropy within single, well-defined populations unselected for phenotype. We undertook novel genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and comprehensive evaluations of heritability and pleiotropy across 18 cancer types in two large, population-based cohorts: the UK Biobank (413,870 European ancestry individuals; 48,961 cancer cases) and the Kaiser Permanente Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging cohorts (66,526 European ancestry individuals; 16,001 cancer cases). The GWAS detected 21 novel genome-wide significant risk variants. In addition, numerous cancer sites exhibited clear heritability. Investigations of pleiotropy identified 12 cancer pairs exhibiting either positive or negative genetic correlations and 43 pleiotropic loci. We identified 158 pleiotropic variants, many of which were enriched for regulatory elements and influenced cross-tissue gene expression. Our findings demonstrate widespread pleiotropy and offer further insight into the complex genetic architecture of cross-cancer susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "Despite the success of therapies targeting oncogenes in cancer, clinical outcomes are limited by a residual disease that results in relapse. This residual disease is characterized by drug-induced adaptation, that in melanoma includes altered metabolism. Here, we examined how targeted therapy reprograms metabolism in BRAF-mutant melanoma cells using a genome-wide RNAi screen and global gene expression profiling. This systematic approach revealed post-transcriptional regulation of metabolism following BRAF inhibition, involving selective mRNA transport and translation. As proof of concept we demonstrate the RNA binding kinase UHMK1 interacts with mRNAs that encode metabolic proteins and selectively controls their transport and translation during adaptation to BRAF targeted therapy. Inactivation of UHMK1 improves metabolic response to BRAF targeted therapy and delays resistance to BRAF and MEK combination therapy in vivo. Our data support a model wherein post-transcriptional gene expression pathways regulate metabolic adaptation underpinning targeted therapy response and suggest inactivation of these pathways may delay disease relapse.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionary transition between winglessness and a full-winged morphology requires selective advantage for intermediate forms. Conversely, repeated secondary wing reductions among the pterygotes indicates relaxation of such selection. However, evolutionary trajectories of such transitions are not well characterized. The stick insects (Phasmatodea) exhibit diverse wing sizes at both interspecific and intersexual levels, and thus provide a system for examining how selection on flight capability, along with other selective forces, drives the evolution of flight-related morphology. Here, we examine variation in relevant morphology for stick insects using data from 1100+ individuals representing 765 species. Although wing size varies along a continuous spectrum, taxa with either long or miniaturized wings are the most common, whereas those with intermediate-sized wings are relatively rare. In a morphological space defined by wing and body size, the aerodynamically relevant parameter termed wing loading (the average pressure exerted on the air by the wings) varies according to sex-specific scaling laws; volant but also flightless forms are the most common outcomes in both sexes. Using phylogenetically-informed analyses, we show that relative wing size and body size are inversely correlated in long-winged insects regardless of sexual differences in morphology and ecology. These results demonstrate the diversity of flight-related morphology in stick insects, and also provide a general framework for addressing evolutionary coupling between wing and body dimensions. We also find indirect evidence for a  fitness valley associated with intermediate-sized wings, suggesting relatively rapid evolutionary transitions between wingless and volant forms.",

Here we report that secondary motor cortex neurons robustly encode both planned and current left/right turning actions across multiple turn locations in a multi-route navigational task. Comparisons within a common statistical framework reveal that secondary motor cortex neurons differentiate contextual factors including environmental position, route, action sequence, orientation, and choice availability. Despite significant modulation by context, action planning and execution are the dominant output signals of secondary motor cortex neurons. These results identify secondary motor cortex as a structure integrating environmental context toward the updating of planned movements.",

    "abstract": "In Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), tactile sensory deficits have motivated the therapeutic use of sensory discrimination training. However, the hierarchical organisation of the brain is such that low-level sensory processing can be dynamically influenced by higher-level knowledge, e.g. knowledge learnt from statistical regularities in the environment. It is unknown whether the learning of such statistical regularities is impaired in CRPS. Here, we employed a hierarchical Bayesian model of predictive coding to investigate statistical learning of tactile-spatial predictions in CRPS. Using a sensory change-detection task, we manipulated bottom-up (spatial displacement of a tactile stimulus) and top-down (probabilistic structure of occurrence) factors to estimate hierarchies of prediction and prediction error signals, as well as their respective precisions or reliability. Behavioural responses to spatial changes were influenced by both the magnitude of spatial displacement (bottom-up) and learnt probabilities of change (top-down). The Bayesian model revealed that patients predictions (of spatial displacements) were found to be less precise, deviating further from the ideal (statistical optimality) compared to healthy controls. This imprecision was less context-dependent, i.e. more enduring across changes in probabilistic context and less finely-tuned to statistics of the environment. This caused greater precision on prediction errors, resulting in predictions that were driven more by momentary spatial changes and less by the history of spatial changes. These results suggest inefficiencies in higher-order statistical learning in CRPS. This may have implications for therapies based on sensory re-training whose effects may be more short-lived if success depends on higher-order learning.",

Recent studies show that actin polymers are present not only in cytoplasm, but also in nuclei of vertebrate cells, and their formation is induced in response to stress. Here, by electron microscopic observation with rapid freezing and high-pressure freezing, we found a unique bundled structure containing actin in nuclei of budding yeast cells undergoing meiosis. The nuclear bundle/cable during meiosis consists of multiple filaments with a rectangular lattice arrangement often showing \"feather-like\" appearance. The bundle is immuno-labeled with anti-actin antibody and sensitive to an actin-depolymerizing drug. Like cytoplasmic bundles, nuclear bundles with actin are rarely seen in pre-meiotic cells and spores, and are induced during meiotic prophase-I. The formation of the nuclear bundles/cables is independent of meiotic DNA double-stranded breaks. We speculate that nuclear bundles/cables containing actin play a role in nuclear events during meiotic prophase I.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence in the scientific literature indicates that some pituitary cell types are organized in complex networks. Previous observations have indicated that this may also be the case in medaka (Oryzias latipes), where long cellular extensions with varicosity-like swellings are formed by luteinizing hormone (Lh)-producing gonadotropes expressing green fluorescent protein. In this study, immunofluorescence of intact pituitaries reveal that Lh beta polypeptides are mainly located in the varicosity-like swellings and at the extremity of the extensions. Some extensions approach nearby Lh-producing cells, and other extensions are in close contact with blood vessels. To investigate whether these extensions may contribute to network formation, we followed their development using confocal and fluorescent microscopy on primary cultures. During the first two days in culture, the extensions initiated the formation of homotypic cellular networks and clustering. The extensions were classified as either major or minor. Major extensions were several cell diameters long, dependent on microtubules, and displaying varicosity-like swellings at regular intervals. Minor extensions typically protruded from the major, were significantly shorter and thinner, and dependent on actin. The swellings were dependent on both microtubules and actin. Flash photolysis of caged Ca2+ showed that the signal was propagated along the major extensions, intensifying in each swelling, indicating a continuous structure. However, the Ca2+ signal did not transfer to the next cell in the network, but was transferred between cells merged at their somas. In summary, Lh-producing gonadotropes in medaka display a complex cellular structure of extensions, possibly linked to communication with blood vessels and/or other gonadotrope cells.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial cells have a polarised distribution of protein complexes on the lateral membrane and are present as a polygonal array dominated by hexagons. Metazoan embryogenesis enables the study of temporal formation of the polygonal array and mechanisms that regulate its distribution. The plasma membrane of the syncytial Drosophila blastoderm embryo is organized as a polygonal array during cortical division cycles with an apical membrane and lateral furrow in between adjacent nuclei. We find that polygonal plasma membrane organization arises in syncytial division cycle 11 and hexagon dominance occurs with increase in furrow length in cycle 12. This is coincident with DE-cadherin and Bazooka enrichment at edges and the septin, Peanut enrichment at vertices of the base of the furrow. DE-cadherin depletion leads to loss of hexagon dominance. Bazooka and Peanut depletion leads to a delay in occurrence of hexagon dominance from nuclear cycle 12 to 13. Hexagon dominance in Bazooka and Peanut mutants occurs with furrow extension and correlates with increase in DE-cadherin in syncytial cycle 13. We conclude that a change in polarity complex distribution leads to loss of furrow stability thereby changing the polygonal organization of the blastoderm embryo.\\n\\nHighlight Summary for TOCMetazoan embryogenesis starts with the formation of polygonal epithelial-like cells.

    "abstract": "Identification of target genes that mediate required functions downstream of transcription factors is hampered by the large number of genes whose expression changes when the factor is removed from a specific tissue and the numerous binding sites for the factor in the genome. Retinoic acid (RA) regulates transcription via RA receptors bound to RA response elements (RAREs) of which there are thousands in vertebrate genomes. Here, we combined ChIP-seq for epigenetic marks and RNA-seq on trunk tissue from wild-type and Aldh1a2-/-embryos lacking RA synthesis that exhibit body axis and forelimb defects. We identified a relatively small number of genes with altered expression when RA is missing that also have nearby RA-regulated deposition of H3K27ac (gene activation mark) or H3K27me3 (gene repression mark) associated with conserved RAREs, suggesting they have important downstream functions. RA-regulated epigenetic marks were identified near RA target genes already known to be required for body axis and limb formation, thus validating our approach, plus many other candidate RA target genes were found. Nr2f1, Nr2f2, Meis1, and Meis2 gene family members were identified by our approach, and double knockouts of each family demonstrated previously unknown requirements for body axis and/or limb formation. These findings demonstrate that our method for identifying RA-regulated epigenetic marks can be used to discover genes important for development.",

To provide further insight into its cellular function, we performed a genome-wide synthetic lethal CRISPR screen in human myeloid cells lacking C9ORF72. We discovered a strong synthetic lethal genetic interaction between C9ORF72 and FIS1, which encodes a mitochondrial membrane protein involved in mitochondrial fission and mitophagy. Mass spectrometry experiments revealed that in C9ORF72 knockout cells, FIS1 strongly bound to a class of immune regulators that activate the receptor for advanced glycation end (RAGE) products and trigger inflammatory cascades. These findings present a novel genetic interactor for C9ORF72 and suggest a compensatory role for FIS1 in suppressing inflammatory signaling in the absence of C9ORF72.",

    "abstract": "Gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli and Salmonella, contain proteinaceous, hair-like, cell surface filaments known as curli. Curli serve to facilitate cell-cell interactions and are essential for host cell colonization. Curli assembly involves six proteins, CsgA, CsgB, CsgC, CsgE, CsgF, and CsgG. CsgE and CsgF are thought to act as chaperones to help prevent the premature aggregation of CsgA and/or CsgB, and to help transport these proteins, through the outer-membrane protein CsgG, to the cell surface where they assemble to form Curli. It has been observed that CsgF is able to inhibit the aggregation of CsgA, the major protein component of Curli. This article describes CsgFs ability to influence the aggregation of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP), an amyloidogenic polypeptide that is unrelated to Curli. In the presence of CsgF no increase in Thioflavin T fluorescence was observed for freshly solubilized hIAPP monitored as a function of time, suggesting that CsgF prevents the aggregation of hIAPP during the time period of observation. An analog of CsgF lacking the N-terminal unstructured region retained the ability to inhibit the aggregation of hIAPP. The nature of the CsgF-hIAPP interaction was probed via fluorescence quenching using a series of single cysteine mutants of CsgF labeled via the individual cysteine side chains with the fluorophore IAEDANS. In the presence of hIAPP, but not in the presence of the non-amyloidogenic rat islet amyloid polypeptide, the fluorophore attached to position of 23 of CsgF was found to be less exposed the quencher acrylamide suggesting that the interaction of hIAPP changes the solvent exposure of the N-terminus of CsgF. Taken together these data suggest that the structured region of CsgF, between residues 66 and 128, is involved in the proteins interaction with hIAPP and that upon interaction structural changes make the N-terminus less solvent exposed.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that the process of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) aggregation from monomers into amyloid fibrils via oligomeric intermediates plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of different synucleinopathies, including Parkinsons disease (PD), multiple system atrophy and dementia with Lewy bodies. However, the nature of the toxic species and the mechanisms by which they contribute to neurotoxicity and disease progression remain elusive. Over the past two decades, significant efforts and resources have been invested in studies aimed at identifying the putative toxic species along the pathway of aSyn fibrillization, and to develop small molecule drugs or antibodies that target toxic aSyn oligomeric intermediates. Although this approach has helped to advance the field and provide insights into the biological properties and toxicity of different aSyn species, many of the fundamental questions regarding the role of aSyn aggregation in PD remain unanswered, and no therapeutic compounds targeting aSyn oligomers have passed clinical trials. Several factors have contributed to this slow progress, including the complexity of the aggregation pathways and the heterogeneity and dynamic nature of aSyn aggregates. In the majority of experiment, the aSyn samples used contain mixtures of aSyn species that exist in an equilibrium and their ratio changes upon modifying experimental conditions. The failure to quantitatively account for the distribution of different aSyn species in different studies has contributed not only to experimental irreproducibility but also to misinterpretation of results and misdirection of valuable resources. Towards addressing these challenges and improving experimental reproducibility in Parkinsons research, we describe here a simple centrifugation-based filtration protocol for the isolation, quantification and assessment of the distribution of of aSyn monomers, oligomers and fibrils, in heterogeneous aSyn samples of increasing complexity. The protocol is simple, does not require any special instrumentation and can be performed rapidly on multiple samples using small volumes. Here, we present and discuss several examples that illustrate the applications of this protocol and how it could contribute to improving the reproducibility of experiments aimed at elucidating the structural basis of aSyn aggregation, seeding activity, toxicity and pathology spreading. This protocol is applicable, with slight modifications, to other amyloid-forming proteins.\\n\\nTable of Content Figure\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=84 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/772160v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (33K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13fb942org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9bc3adorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4b9c66org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9054f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Familial MD has been reported in 6-9% of sporadic cases, and few genes including FAM136A, DTNA, PRKCB, SEMA3D and DPT have been involved in single families, suggesting genetic heterogeneity. In this study, the authors recruited 46 families with MD to search for relevant candidate genes for hearing loss in familial MD.\\n\\nDesignExome sequencing data from MD patients were analyzed to search for rare variants in hearing loss genes in a case-control study. A total of 109 patients with MD (73 familial cases and 36 early-onset sporadic patients) diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria defined by the Barany Society were recruited in 11 hospitals. The allelic frequencies of rare variants in hearing loss genes were calculated in individuals with familial MD. A single rare variant analysis (SRVA) and a gene burden analysis (GBA) were conducted in the dataset selecting one patient from each family. Allelic frequencies from European and Spanish reference datasets were used as controls.\\n\\nResultsA total of 5136 single nucleotide variants in hearing loss genes were considered for SRVA in familial MD cases, but only one heterozygous variant in the OTOG gene (rs552304627) was found in two unrelated families. The GBA found an enrichment of rare missense variants in the OTOG gene in familial MD. So, 15/46 families (33%) showed at least one rare missense variant in the OTOG gene, suggesting a key role in familial MD.\\n\\nConclusionsThe authors found an enrichment of multiplex rare missense variants in the OTOG gene in familial MD.

    "abstract": "Phytoplasmas are intracellular bacterial plant pathogens that cause devastating diseases in crops and ornamental plants by the secretion of effector proteins. One of these effector proteins, termed SECRETED ASTER YELLOWS-WITCHES BROOM PROTEIN 54 (SAP54), leads to the degradation of a specific subset of floral homeotic proteins of the MIKC-type MADS-domain family via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In consequence, the developing flowers show the homeotic transformation of floral organs into vegetative leaf-like structures. The molecular mechanism of SAP54 action involves physical binding to the keratin-like K-domain of MIKC-type proteins, and to some RAD23 proteins, which translocate ubiquitylated substrates to the proteasome. The structural requirements and specificity of SAP54 function are poorly understood, however. Here we report, based on biophysical and molecular biological analyses, that SAP54 folds into -helical structures. We also show that the insertion of helix-breaking mutations disrupts correct folding of SAP54, which interferes with the ability of SAP54 to bind to its target proteins and to cause disease phenotypes in vivo. Surprisingly, dynamic light scattering data together with electrophoretic mobility shift assays suggest that SAP54 preferentially binds to multimeric complexes of MIKC-type proteins rather than to dimers or monomers of these proteins. Together with literature data this finding suggests that MIKC-type proteins and SAP54 constitute multimeric -helical coiled-coils, possibly also involving other partners such as RAD23 proteins. Our investigations clarify the structure-function relationship of an important phytoplasma effector protein and thus may ultimately help to develop treatments against some devastating plant diseases.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTPhytoplasmas are bacterial plant pathogens that cause devastating diseases in crops and ornamental plants by the secretion of effector proteins such as SAP54, which leads to the degradation of some floral homeotic proteins.
