    "abstract": "Frameshift protein sequences encoded by alternative reading frames of coding genes have been considered meaningless, and frameshift mutations have been considered of little importance for the molecular evolution of coding genes and proteins. However, functional frameshifts have been found widely existing. It was puzzling how a frameshift protein kept its structure and functionality while its amino-acid sequence was changed substantially. Here we show that frame similarities between frameshifts and wild types are higher than random similarities and are defined at the genetic code, gene, and genome levels. In the standard genetic code, frameshift codon substitutions are more conservative than random substitutions. The frameshift tolerability of the standard genetic code ranks in the top 2.0-3.5% of alternative genetic codes, showing that the genetic code is nearly optimal for frameshift tolerance. Furthermore, frameshift-resistant codons (codon pairs) appear more frequently than expected in many genes and certain genomes, showing that the frameshift optimality is reflected not only in the genetic code but more importantly, in its allowance of further optimizing the frameshift tolerance of a particular gene or genome, which shed light on the role of frameshift mutations in molecular and genomic evolution.",

    "abstract": "Glucocorticoids--stress hormones released from the adrenal cortex--reduce phobic fear in anxiety disorders and enhance psychotherapy, possibly by reducing the retrieval of fear memories and enhancing the consolidation of new corrective memories. Glucocorticoid signaling in the basolateral amygdala can influence connected fear and memory-related cortical regions, but this is not fully understood. Previous studies investigated specific pathways moderated by glucocorticoids, for example, visual-temporal pathways; however, these analyses were limited to a-priori selected regions. Here, we performed whole-brain pattern analysis to localize phobic stimulus decoding related to the fear-reducing effect of glucocorticoids. We reanalyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from a previously published study with spider-phobic patients and healthy controls. The patients received either glucocorticoids or a placebo treatment before the exposure to spider images. There was moderate evidence that patients with phobia had higher decoding of phobic content in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the left and right anterior insula compared to controls. Decoding in the ACC and the right insula showed strong evidence for correlation with experienced fear. Patients with cortisol reported a reduction of fear by 10-13%; however, there was only weak evidence for changes in neural decoding compared to placebo which was found in the precuneus, the opercular cortex, and the left cerebellum.",

    "abstract": "The colonisation of specific body sites in contact with the external environment by microorganisms is both well-described and universally accepted, whereas, the existence of microbial evidence in other \\\"classically sterile\\\" locations including the blood, synovial space, and lungs, is a relatively new concept. Increasingly, a role for the microbiome in disease is being considered, and it is therefore necessary to increase our understanding of these. To date, little data support the existence of a \\\"synovial fluid microbiome\\\".\\n\\nMethodsThe presence and identity of bacterial and fungal DNA in the synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and healthy control subjects was investigated through amplification and sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal internal transcribed spacer region 2 respectively. Synovial fluid concentrations of the cytokines IL-6, IL-17A, IL22 and IL-23 were determined by ELISA.\\n\\nResultsBacterial 16S rRNA genes were detected in 87.5% RA patients, and all healthy control subjects. At the phylum level, the microbiome was predominated by Proteobacteria (Control = 83.5%, RA = 79.3%) and Firmicutes (Control = 16.1%, RA = 20.3%), and to a much lesser extent, Actinobacteria (Control = 0.2%, RA = 0.3%) and Bacteroidetes (Control = 0.1%, RA = 0.1%). Fungal DNA was identified in 75% RA samples, and 88.8% healthy controls. At the phylum level, synovial fluid was predominated by members of the Basidiomycota (Control = 53.9%, RA = 46.9%) and Ascomycota (Control = 35.1%, RA = 50.8%) phyla. Statistical analysis revealed key taxa that were differentially present or abundant dependent on disease status.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study reports the presence of a synovial fluid microbiome, and determines that this is modulated by disease status (RA) as are other classical microbiome niches.",

    "abstract": "Automated protein annotation using the Gene Ontology (GO) plays an important role in the biosciences. Evaluation has always been considered central to developing novel annotation methods, but little attention has been paid to the evaluation metrics themselves. Evaluation metrics define how well an annotation method performs and allows for them to be ranked against one another. Unfortunately, most of these metrics were adopted from the machine learning literature without establishing whether they were appropriate for GO annotations.\\n\\nWe propose a novel approach for comparing GO evaluation metrics called Artificial Dilution Series (ADS). Our approach uses existing annotation data to generate a series of annotation sets with different levels of correctness (referred to as their signal level). We calculate the evaluation metric being tested for each annotation set in the series, allowing us to identify whether it can separate different signal levels. Finally, we contrast these results with several false positive annotation sets, which are designed to expose systematic weaknesses in GO assessment.\\n\\nWe compared 37 evaluation metrics for GO annotation using ADS and identified drastic differences between metrics. We show that some metrics struggle to differentiate between different signal levels, while others give erroneously high scores to the false positive data sets. Based on our findings, we provide guidelines on which evaluation metrics perform well with the Gene Ontology and propose improvements to several well-known evaluation metrics. In general, we argue that evaluation metrics should be tested for their performance and we provide software for this purpose (https://bitbucket.org/plyusnin/ads/). ADS is applicable to other areas of science where the evaluation of prediction results is non-trivial.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryIn the biosciences, predictive methods are becoming increasingly necessary as novel sequences are generated at an ever-increasing rate. The volume of sequence data necessitates Automated Function Prediction (AFP) as manual curation is often impossible. Unfortunately, selecting the best AFP method is complicated by researchers using different evaluation metrics. Furthermore, many commonly-used metrics can give misleading results. We argue that the use of poor metrics in AFP evaluation is a result of the lack of methods to benchmark the metrics themselves. We propose an approach called Artificial Dilution Series (ADS). ADS uses existing data sets to generate multiple artificial AFP results, where each result has a controlled error rate. We use ADS to understand whether different metrics can distinguish between results with known quantities of error. Our results highlight dramatic differences in performance between evaluation metrics.",

    "abstract": "Thylakoid membranes in chloroplasts contain photosynthetic protein complexes that convert light energy into chemical energy. Photosynthetic protein complexes are considered to undergo structural reorganization to maintain the efficiency of photochemical reactions. A detailed description of the mobility of photosynthetic complexes in real-time is necessary to understand how macromolecular organization of the membrane is altered by environmental fluctuations. Here, we used high-speed atomic force microscopy to visualize and characterize the in situ mobility of individual protein complexes in grana thylakoid membranes isolated from Spinacia oleracea. Our observations reveal that these membranes can harbor complexes with at least two distinctive classes of mobility. A large fraction of grana membranes contained proteins with quasi-static mobility, exhibiting molecular displacements smaller than 10 nm2. In the remaining fraction, the protein mobility is variable with molecular displacements of up to 100 nm2. This visualization at high-spatiotemporal resolution enabled us to estimate an average diffusion coefficient of [~]1 nm2 s-1. Interestingly, both confined and Brownian diffusion models could describe the protein mobility of the second group of membranes. We also provide the first direct evidence of rotational diffusion of photosynthetic complexes. The rotational diffusion of photosynthetic complexes could be an adaptive response to the high protein density in the membrane to guarantee the efficiency of electron transfer reactions. This characterization of the mobility of individual photosynthetic complexes in grana membranes establishes a foundation that could be adapted to study the dynamics of the complexes inside the intact and photosynthetically functional thylakoid membranes to be able to understand its structural responses to diverse environmental fluctuations.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEWe characterized the dynamics of individual photosynthetic protein complexes in grana thylakoid membranes from Spinacia oleracea by high-speed atomic microscopy (HS-AFM). Direct visualization at high spatiotemporal resolution unveils that the mobility of photosynthetic proteins is heterogeneous but governed by the confinement effect imposed by the high protein density in the thylakoid membrane. The photosynthetic complexes display rotational diffusion, which might be a consequence of the crowded environment in the membrane and a mechanism to sustain an efficient electron transfer chain.",

Whilst tumour cell migration occurs fundamentally in 3 spatial dimensions (3D), for practical reasons, most migration studies to date have performed analysis in 2D. Here we imaged live multicellular tumour spheroids with lightsheet fluorescence microscopy to determine cellular migration and invasion in 3D over time (4D). We focused on glioblastoma, which are aggressive brain tumours, where cell invasion into the surrounding normal brain remains a major clinical challenge. We developed a workflow for analysing complex 3D cell movement, taking into account migration within the spheroid as well as invasion into the surrounding matrix. This provided metrics characterising cell motion, which we used to evaluate the efficacy of chemother-apeutics on invasion. These rich datasets open avenues for further studies on drug efficacy, microenvironment composition, as well as collective cell migration and metastatic potential.",

We begin by detecting outliers in a single exposure-outcome MR analysis, hypothesising they are due to horizontal pleiotropy. We search across thousands of complete GWAS summary datasets in the MR-Base database to systematically identify other (\\\"candidate\\\") traits that associate with the outliers. We developed a multi-trait pleiotropy model of the heterogeneity in the exposure-outcome analysis due to pathways through candidate traits. Through detailed investigation of several causal relationships, many pleiotropic pathways were uncovered with already established causal effects, validating the approach, but also novel putative causal pathways. Adjustment for pleiotropic pathways reduced the heterogeneity across the analyses.",

We analyzed 164,518 mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences to quantify changes in genetic diversity between 1980-2016. We found temporal change in genetic diversity, with both increasing and decreasing trends observed. The magnitude and sign of human impacts on genetic diversity depended on scale and taxon. In contrast, latitude was a strong predictor of diversity in fish, insects, and mammals. Our analyses provide a first worldwide picture of human impacts on animal genetic diversity.

    "abstract": "We studied oscillatory mechanisms of successful memory formation in 47 younger and 52 older adults in an intentional associative memory task with cued recall. While older adults showed reduced memory performance, we found subsequent memory effects (SME) in alpha/beta and theta frequency bands in both age groups. Using logistic mixed effect models, we then investigated whether interindividual differences in structural integrity of memory regions that were functionally linked to oscillatory dynamics in previous studies (Hanslmayr et al., 2011) could account for interindividual differences in the strength of the SME. Structural integrity of inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and hippocampus (HC) was reduced in older adults. SME in the alpha/beta band were indeed modulated by the cortical thickness of inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), in line with its hypothesized role for deep semantic elaboration. Importantly, this structure-function relationship did not differ by age group. However, older adults were more frequently represented among the participants with low cortical thickness and consequently weaker SME in the alpha band. Thus, our results suggest that differences in the structural integrity of the IFG are the basis not only for interindividual, but also for age differences in memory formation.",

    "abstract": "Kinesin is part of the microtubule (MT)-binding motor protein superfamily, which exerts crucial functions in cell division and intracellular transport in different organelles. The heterotrimeric kinesin-II, consisting of the kinesin like protein KIF3A/3B heterodimer and kinesin-associated protein KAP3, is highly conserved across species between the green alga Chlamydomonas and humans. It plays diverse roles in cargo transport including anterograde (base to tip) trafficking in cilium. However, the molecular determinants mediating trafficking of heterotrimeric kinesin-II itself is poorly understood. Using the unicellular eukaryote Chlamydomonas and mammalian cells, we show that RanGTP regulates ciliary trafficking of KAP3. We found the armadillo repeat region 6-9 (ARM6-9) of KAP3, required for its nuclear translocation, is sufficient for its targeting to the ciliary base. Given that KAP3 is essential for cilia formation and the emerging roles of RanGTP/importin {beta} in ciliary protein targeting, we further investigate the effect of RanGTP in cilium length regulation in these two different systems. We demonstrate that precise control of RanGTP levels, revealed by different Ran mutants, is crucial for cilium formation and maintenance. Most importantly, we were able to segregate RanGTP regulation of ciliary protein incorporation from of its nuclear roles. Our work provides important support for the model that nuclear import mechanisms have been coopted for independent roles in ciliary import.",

Single domain Small Alarmone Synthetases (SASs) are RSH family members that contain the (p)ppGpp synthesis (SYNTH) domain, but lack the hydrolysis (HD) domain and regulatory C-terminal domains of the long RSHs such as Rel, RelA and SpoT. We have discovered that multiple SAS subfamilies can be encoded in broadly distributed conserved bicistronic operon architectures in bacteria and bacteriophages that are reminiscent of those typically seen in toxin-antitoxin (TA) operons. We have validated five of these SASs as being toxic (toxSASs), with neutralisation by the protein products of six neighbouring antitoxin genes. The toxicity of Cellulomonas marina ToxSAS FaRel is mediated by alarmone accumulation combined with depletion of cellular ATP and GTP pools, and this is counteracted by its HD domain-containing antitoxin. Thus, the ToxSAS-antiToxSAS system is a novel TA paradigm comprising multiple different antitoxins that exemplifies how ancient nucleotide-based signalling mechanisms can be repurposed as TA modules during evolution, potentially multiple times independently.",

    "abstract": "Crop models contain a number of genotype-dependent parameters, which need to be estimated for each genotype. This is a major difficulty in crop modeling. We propose a hybrid method for adapting a crop model to new genotypes. The genotype-dependent parameters of the model could be obtained by phenotyping (or gene-based modeling). Then field data for example from variety trials could be used to provide a simple empirical correction to the model, of the form a+b times an environmental variable. This approach combines the advantages of phenotyping, namely that the genotype-specific parameters have a clear meaning and are comparable between genotypes, and the advantages of fitting the model to field data, namely that the corrected model is adapted to a specific target population. It has the advantage of being very simple to apply, and furthermore gives useful information as to which environmental variables are not fully accounted for in the initial model. In this study, this empirical correction is applied to the SUNFLO crop model for sunflower, using field data from a multi-environment trial network. The empirical correction reduced mean squared error (MSE) on the average by 54% for prediction of yield and by 26% for prediction of oil content, compared to the initial model. Most of the improvement came from eliminating bias, with some further improvement from the environmental term in the regression.",

    "abstract": "A major function of sensory processing is to achieve neural representations of objects that are stable across changes in context and perspective. Small changes in exploratory behavior can lead to large changes in signals at the sensory periphery, thus resulting in ambiguous neural representations of objects. Overcoming this ambiguity is a hallmark of human object recognition across sensory modalities. Here, we investigate how the perception of tactile texture remains stable across exploratory movements of the hand, including changes in scanning speed, despite the concomitant changes in afferent responses. To this end, we scanned a wide range of everyday textures across the fingertips of Rhesus macaques at multiple speeds and recorded the responses evoked in tactile nerve fibers and somatosensory cortical neurons. We found that individual cortical neurons exhibit a wider range of speed-sensitivities than do nerve fibers. The resulting representations of speed and texture in cortex are more independent than are their counterparts in the nerve and account for speed-invariant perception of texture. We demonstrate that this separation of speed and texture information is a natural consequence of previously described cortical computations.",

    "abstract": "Several protein-RNA cross linking protocols have been established in recent years to delineate the molecular interaction of an RNA Binding Protein (RBP) and its target RNAs. However, functional dissection of the role of the RBP binding sites in modulating the post-transcriptional fate of the target RNA remains challenging. CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system is being commonly employed to perturb both coding and noncoding regions in the genome. With the advancements in genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 screens, it is now possible to not only perturb specific binding sites but also probe the global impact of protein-RNA interaction sites across cell types. Here, we present SliceIt (http://sliceit.soic.iupui.edu/), a database of in silico sgRNA (single guide RNA) library to facilitate conducting such high throughput screens. SliceIt comprises of ~4.8 million unique sgRNAs with an estimated range of 2-8 sgRNAs designed per RBP binding site, for eCLIP experiments of >100 RBPs in HepG2 and K562 cell lines from the ENCODE project. SliceIt provides a user friendly environment, developed using advanced search engine framework, Elasticsearch. It is available in both table and genome browser views facilitating the easy navigation of RBP binding sites, designed sgRNAs, exon expression levels across 53 human tissues along with prevalence of SNPs and GWAS hits on binding sites. Exon expression profiles enable examination of locus specific changes proximal to the binding sites. Users can also upload custom tracks of various file formats directly onto genome browser, to navigate additional genomic features in the genome and compare with other types of omics profiles. All the binding site-centric information is dynamically accessible via \\\"search by gene\\\", \\\"search by coordinates\\\" and \\\"search by RBP\\\" options and readily available to download. Validation of the sgRNA library in SliceIt was performed by selecting RBP binding sites in Lipt1 gene and designing sgRNAs. Effect of CRISPR/Cas9 perturbations on the selected binding sites in HepG2 cell line, was confirmed based on altered proximal exon expression levels using qPCR, further supporting the utility of the resource to design experiments for perturbing protein-RNA interaction networks. Thus, SliceIt provides a one-stop repertoire of guide RNA library to perturb RBP binding sites, along with several layers of functional information to design both low and high throughput CRISPR/Cas9 screens, for studying the phenotypes and diseases associated with RBP binding sites.",

It has been argued that the p factor may reflect dysfunctional thinking present in serious mental illness. In support of this, we previously used a theory-free, data-driven multimodal neuroimaging approach to find that higher p factor scores are associated with structural alterations within a cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit (CTCC) and visual association cortex, both of which are important for monitoring and coordinating information processing in the service of executive control. Here we attempt to replicate these associations by conducting region-of-interest analyses of CTCC and visual association cortex using data from 875 members of the Dunedin Longitudinal Study, a five-decade study of a population-representative birth cohort now 45 years old. We further sought to replicate a more recent report that p factor scores can be predicted by patterns of distributed cerebellar morphology as estimated through independent component analysis. We successfully replicated associations between higher p factor scores and both reduced grey matter volume of the visual association cortex and fractional anisotropy of pontine white matter pathways within the CTCC. In contrast, we failed to replicate prior associations between cerebellar structure and p factor scores. Collectively, our findings encourage further focus on the CTCC and visual association cortex as core neural substrates and potential biomarkers of general psychopathology.",

Often the molecular structure of a therapeutic target is unknown and randomized methods are used to design antibodies without a model that relates antibody sequence to desired properties. Here we present a machine learning method that can design human Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies with target affinities that are superior to candidates from phage display panning experiments within a limited design budget. We also demonstrate that machine learning can improve target-specificity by the modular composition of models from different experimental campaigns, enabling a new integrative approach to improving target specificity.

    "abstract": "How the central nervous system (CNS) controls many joints and muscles is a fundamental question in motor neuroscience and related research areas. An attractive hypothesis is the module hypothesis: the CNS controls groups of joints or muscles (i.e., spatial modules) while providing time-varying motor commands (i.e., temporal modules) to the spatial modules rather than controlling each joint or muscle separately. Another fundamental question is how the CNS generates numerous repertories of movement patterns. One hypothesis is that the CNS modulates the spatial and/or temporal modules depending on the required tasks. It is thus essential to quantify the spatial module, the temporal module, and the task-dependent modulation of those modules. Although previous methods attempted to quantify these aspects, they considered the modulation in only the spatial or temporal module. These limitations were possibly due to the constraints inherent to conventional methods for quantifying the spatial and temporal modules. Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of tensor decomposition in quantifying the spatial module, the temporal module, and the task-dependent modulation of these modules without such limitations. We further demonstrate that the tensor decomposition provides a new perspective on the task-dependent modulation of spatiotemporal modules: in switching from walking to running, the CNS modulates the peak timing in the temporal module while recruiting proximal muscles in the corresponding spatial module.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThere are at least two fundamental questions in motor neuroscience and related research areas: 1) how does the central nervous system (CNS) control many joints and muscles and 2) how does the CNS generate numerous repertories of movement patterns.

One possible answer to question 2) is that the CNS modulates the spatial and/or temporal module depending on the required tasks.

The CNS modulated the peak timing in the temporal module while recruiting proximal muscles in the corresponding spatial module.",

    "abstract": "Sterols are crucial components of biological membranes that help maintain membrane integrity and regulate various processes such as endocytosis, protein oligomerization and signaling. Although synthetized in the ER, sterols are at highest concentrations at the plasma membrane (PM) in all eukaryotic organisms. Here, by applying a genetically encoded sterol biosensor (D4H), we visualize a sterol flow between PM and endosomes in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. While D4H is detected at the PM during steady-state growth, inhibition of Arp2/3-dependent F-actin assembly unexpectedly promotes the reversible re-localization of the probe to internal sterol rich compartments (STRIC), as shown by correlative light-electron microscopy. Time-lapse imaging identifies STRIC as a late secretory, endosomal compartment labelled by the synaptobrevin Syb1. Retrograde sterol internalization to STRIC is independent of endocytosis or an intact Golgi. Instead, it depends on Ltc1, a LAM/StARkin-family protein that localizes to ER-PM contact sites. In ltc1{Delta}, sterols over-accumulate at the PM, which forms extended ER-interacting invaginations, indicating that sterol transfer by Ltc1 contributes to PM size homeostasis. Anterograde sterol movement from STRIC is independent of canonical vesicular trafficking components but requires Arp2/3 activity, suggesting a novel physiological role for this complex. Thus, transfer routes orthogonal to vesicular trafficking govern the retrograde and anterograde flow of sterols in the cell.",

We found that dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) differentiated HL-60 cells have larger size, increased length, and lower ability to squeeze through narrow channels compared to primary neutrophils. They migrate through tapered microfluidic channels slower than primary neutrophils, but faster than HL60s differentiated by other protocols, e.g. using all-trans retinoic acid. We found that differentiated HL-60 can swarm toward zymosan particle clusters, though they display disorganized migratory patterns and produce swarms of smaller size compared to primary neutrophils.",

We show that diurnal variations during 24-hour sampling can be leveraged to discriminate between biomarkers in sewage that are associated with human activity from those related to the environmental background.

We additionally detected the possible risk variants p.R78C (rs146774384) in one case, p.D179H (rs147138516) in one case which occurred on the same haplotype as p.E365K, and one novel variant c.335C>T or p.(L335=), that potentially impacts splicing of GBA transcripts. Additionally, we found a higher prevalence of dementia among patients with GBA variants.\n\nConclusionThis work confirmed the utility of nanopore sequencing as a high-throughput method to identify known and novel GBA variants, and to assign precise haplotypes. Our observations may contribute to improved understanding of the effects of variants on disease pathogenesis, and to the development of more targeted treatments.",

Metaproteomic approaches focusing on the characterization of expressed proteins and post-translational modifications (PTMs) provide a deeper understanding of microbial communities. Previous research has highlighted the value of examining microbiome-wide protein expression in studying the roles of the microbiome in human diseases. Nevertheless, the regulation of protein functions in complex microbiomes remains under-explored. This is mainly due to the lack of efficient bioinformatics tools to identify and quantify PTMs in the microbiome. We have developed a comprehensive software termed MetaLab for the data analysis of metaproteomic datasets. Here we build an open search workflow within MetaLab for unbiased identification and quantification of PTMs from microbiome samples. This bioinformatics platform provides information about proteins, PTMs, taxa, functions, and pathways of microbial communities. The performance of the workflow was evaluated using conventional proteomics, metaproteomics from mouse and human gut microbiomes, and modification-specific enriched datasets. Superior accuracy and sensitivity were obtained simultaneously by using our method comparing with the traditional closed search strategy.",

    "abstract": "As an important member of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, human CYP1A2 is associated with the metabolism of caffeine and melatonin and the activation of precarcinogens. Besides, this CYP protein also involves in metabolizing 5-10% of clinical medicines. Some peripheral mutations in CYP1A2 (P42R, I386F, R431W, and R456H) significantly decrease the enzyme activities, resulting in a vital reduction in substrate metabolisms. To explore the effects of these peripheral mutations, we constructed a membrane-binding model for the full-length human CYP1A2 and studied their dynamic behaviors on lipid membranes. Free energy calculations indicate that the peripheral mutations donot influence substrate binding. P42R is located in the N-terminal anchor, and its positive charged sidechain is adverse to membrane binding. I386F enhances the van der Waals contacts of the water channel bottleneck and R456H breaks the hydrogen bonding interactions that function to position the BC loop, both of which result in a significant inhibition on the water channel. R431W causes a sidechain conformational rearrangement for aromatic residues around the substrate channel, making it in a closed state in most cases. Our computational simulations demonstrate that pi-pi stacking interactions are essential for substrate binding and channel opening. We hope that these findings may be of general relevance to the mutation-induced activity changes for CYP proteins, providing useful information for understanding the CYP-mediated drug metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Biomolecular condensates are emerging as an important organizational principle within living cells. These condensed states are formed by phase separation, yet little is known about how material properties are encoded within the constituent molecules and how the specificity for being in different phases is established. Here we use analytic theory to explain the phase behavior of the cancer-related protein SPOP and its substrate DAXX. Binary mixtures of these molecules have a phase diagram that contains dilute liquid, dense liquid, and gel states. We show that these discrete phases appear due to a competition between SPOP-DAXX and DAXX-DAXX interactions. The stronger SPOP-DAXX interactions dominate at sub-stoichiometric DAXX concentrations leading to the formation of crosslinked gels. The theory shows that the driving force for gel formation is not the binding energy, but rather the entropy of distributing DAXX molecules on the binding sites. At high DAXX concentrations the SPOP-DAXX interactions saturate, which leads to the dissolution of the gel and the appearance of a liquid phase driven by weaker DAXX-DAXX interactions. This competition between interactions allows multiple dense phases to form in a narrow region of parameter space. We propose that the molecular architecture of phase-separating proteins governs the internal structure of dense phases, their material properties and their functions. Analytical theory can reveal these properties on the long length and time scales relevant to biomolecular condensates.",

    "abstract": "During the pore-forming process, cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) bind to cholesterol-rich membranes and subsequently undergo a series of conformational changes, predominantly involving in the collapse of the protein and the transformation from  helices to {beta}-hairpins to form a large hydrophobic pore. In the current study, we reconstructed a structural model for both the prepore and pore-forming complexes of PFO based on the cryo-EM data of pneumolysin and performed molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations to study the conformational changes in the PFO prepore-to-pore conversion. Our simulations indicate that D2 cannot collapse spontaneously due to the hydrogen bonding and pi-pi interactions between domains D2 and D3, which are partially weakened by binding to cell membranes and oligomerization. The free energy landscape for the prepore-to-pore conversion reveals that an additional force is required for the collapse of D2 to overcome an energy barrier of [~] 24 kcal/mol. Based on these computational results, we proposed a hydrophobic force-induced pore-forming mechanism to explain the pore-forming process of CDCs. In this mechanism, the hydrophobic interactions between the TMHs and membranes are essential for the prepore-to-pore conversion. The hydrophobic force generated by the TMHs-membrane interactions drives the conformational changes in domains D2 and D3. These findings well explain how the conformational changes within two distant domains synergistically occur, and fits well for the previous biophysical and biochemical data.",

These lines, collectively known as environment genic male sterile lines, were sown under greenhouse growth conditions where temperatures were more than 34{degrees}C with an objective of inducing complete male gamete sterility in them. Results indicated that high temperature growth conditions induces complete male gamete sterility in both the PGMS and TGMS lines. The impact of this is that, it will be possible to produce pure basmati hybrid rice seed in the tropical regions without contamination with pure breed lines. The male sterile PGMS/TGMS were pollinated with pollen from basmati370 and 217 grown under natural conditions and some hybrid seeds were obtained. This shows that high temperature emasculated the male gametes but not female ones. The conclusion is that it is possible to induce complete male gamete sterility in PGMS and TGMS under greenhouse in tropical growth conditions, and to produce hybrid rice seeds.

By addressing the problem in a simple system composed of a self-replicating molecule (a replicase) and a parasite molecule that needs the replicase for copying itself, we show that transient (rather than permanent) compartmentalization is sufficient to the task. We also exhibit a regime in which the concentrations of the two kinds of molecules undergo sustained oscillations. Our model should be relevant not only for origin-of-life scenarios but also for describing directed evolution experiments, which increasingly rely on transient compartmentalization with pooling and natural selection.",

    "abstract": "The CC-type chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) is involved in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory conditions. The oligomerization and aggregation of CCL5 are considered to be responsible for its inflammatory properties. The CC-type dimer acts as the basic unit to constitute the oligomer. However, the structural basis of CCL5 oligomerization remains controversial. In this study, NMR and biophysical analyses proposed evidence that no single dimer-dimer interaction dominates in the oligomerization process of CCL5. CCL5 could oligomerize alternatively through two different interactions, E66-K25 and E66-R44/K45. In addition, a newly determined trimer structure reported an interfacial interaction through the N-terminal 12FAY14 sequence. The interaction contributes to aggregation and precipitation. In accordance with the observations, an integrative model explains the CCL5 oligomerization and aggregation process. CCL5 assembly consists of two types of dimer-dimer interactions and one aggregation mechanism. For full-length CCL5, the molecular accumulation triggers oligomerization through the E66-K25 interaction, and the 12FAY14 interaction acts as a secondary effect to derive aggregation. The E66-R44/K45 interaction dominates in CCL5 N-terminal truncations. The interaction would lead to filament-like formation in solution.",

Here we identify C17orf53/MCM8IP, an OB-fold containing protein that binds ssDNA, as a novel DNA repair factor involved in HR. MCM8IP-deficient cells exhibit HR defects, especially in long-tract gene conversion, occurring downstream of RAD51 loading, consistent with a role for MCM8IP in HR-dependent DNA synthesis. Moreover, loss of MCM8IP confers cellular sensitivity to crosslinking agents and PARP inhibition. Importantly, we identify a direct interaction with MCM8-9, a putative helicase complex mutated in Primary Ovarian Insufficiency, that is crucial for MCM8IPs ability to promote resistance to DNA damaging agents. In addition to its association with MCM8-9, MCM8IP also binds directly to RPA1. We show that the interactions of MCM8IP with both MCM8-9 and RPA are required to maintain replication fork progression in response to treatment with crosslinking agents.

Here we demonstrate that 3-Phosphoinositide-Dependent Protein Kinase1 (PDK1), which is conserved in plants and mammals, functions as a molecular hub integrating the upstream lipid signalling and the downstream substrate activity through phosphorylation. Genetic analysis uncovers that loss-of-function Arabidopsis mutant pdk1.1 pdk1.2 exhibits a plethora of abnormalities in organogenesis and growth, due to the defective PIN-dependent auxin transport. Further cellular and biochemical analyses reveal that PDK1 phosphorylates D6 Protein Kinase to facilitate its activity towards PIN proteins.

Plants sense this cell wall damage as a mark of infection and induce immune responses. Little is known about the plant functions that are involved in the elaboration of cell wall damage-induced immune responses. Transcriptome analysis revealed that a rice receptor kinase, WALL-ASSOCIATED KINASE-LIKE 21 (OsWAKL21.2), is upregulated following treatment with either Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo, a bacterial pathogen) or lipaseA/esterase (LipA: a CWDE of Xoo).

Overexpression of OsWAKL21.2 in rice mimics LipA treatment mediated induction of immune responses and enhanced expression of defence related genes, indicating it could be involved in the perception of LipA induced cell wall damage in rice. OsWAKL21.2 is a dual function kinase having in-vitro kinase and guanylate cyclase (GC) activities. Ectopic expression of OsWAKL21.2 in Arabidopsis also activates plant immune responses.

In plants the respective mutants show alterations in the architecture of thylakoid membranes and in the repair of PSII after photo-inhibition. However the protein kinase targets several subunits of PSII, as well as other proteins. To specifically investigate the role of phosphorylation of the different PSII subunits, we used site-directed mutagenesis and chloroplast transformation in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Major, evolutionarily-conserved sites of phosphorylation in three components of PSII (CP43, D2 and PsbH) were mutated to replace the corresponding serine or threonine residues with alanine. The alanine substitution mutant of D2 had no apparent phenotype, while the mutant of CP43 presented a minor delay in recovery from photo-inhibition. Alanine substitutions of the phosphorylation sites in PsbH had significant effects on the accumulation of PSII or on its recovery from photo-inhibition. When mutations in two of the target subunits were combined through a second cycle of chloroplast transformation, the strongest phenotype was observed in the mutant lacking phosphorylation of both PsbH and CP43, which showed delayed recovery from photo-inhibition. Surprisingly this phenotype was reversed in the mutant defective for phosphorylation of all three subunits. Our analysis indicates a prominent role for the N-terminus of PsbH in the stable accumulation of PSII and of PsbH phosphorylation in its repair cycle.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTTo specifically investigate the role of PSII phosphorylation, alanine-substitution mutants of the major phospho-sites in the subunits of PSII were generated individually or in combinations using chloroplast transformation.

    "abstract": "Auxin controls multiple aspects of plant growth and development. However, its role in stress responses remains poorly understood. Auxin acts on the transcriptional regulation of target genes, mainly through Auxin Response Factors (ARF). This study focuses on the involvement of SlARF4 in tomato tolerance to salinity and osmotic stress. Using a reverse genetic approach, we found that the antisense down-regulation of SlARF4 promotes root development and density, increases soluble sugars content and maintains chlorophyll content at high levels under stress conditions. Furthermore, ARF4-as displayed higher tolerance to salt and osmotic stress through reduced stomatal conductance coupled with increased leaf relative water content and ABA content under normal and stressful conditions. This increase in ABA content was correlated with the activation of ABA biosynthesis genes and the repression of ABA catabolism genes. cat1, Cu/ZnSOD and mdhar genes were up-regulated in ARF4-as plants which can result in a better tolerance to salt and osmotic stress. A CRISPR/Cas9 induced SlARF4 mutant showed similar growth and stomatal responses as ARF4-as plants, which suggest that arf4-cr can tolerate salt and osmotic stresses. Our data support the involvement of ARF4 as a key factor in tomato tolerance to salt and osmotic stresses and confirm the use of CRISPR technology as an efficient tool for functional reverse genetics studies.",

    "abstract": "Enhanced levels of antioxidants, phenolic compounds, carotenoids and vitamin C have been reported for several crops grown under organic fertilizer, albeit with yield penalties. As organic agricultural practices continue to grow and find favor it is critical to gain an understanding of the molecular underpinnings of the factors that limit the yields in organically farmed crops. Concomitant phytochemical and transcriptomic analysis was performed on mature fruit and leaf tissues derived from Solanum lycopersicum L.  Oregon Spring grown under organic and conventional fertilizer conditions to evaluate the following hypotheses. 1. Organic soil fertilizer management results in greater allocation of photosynthetically derived resources to the synthesis of secondary metabolites than to plant growth, and 2. Genes involved in changes in the accumulation of phytonutrients under organic fertilizer regime will exhibit differential expression, and that the growth under different fertilizer treatments will elicit a differential response from the tomato genome. Both these hypotheses were supported, suggesting an adjustment of the metabolic and genomic activity of the plant in response to different fertilizers. Organic fertilizer treatment showed an activation of photoinhibitory processes through differential activation of nitrogen transport and assimilation genes resulting in higher accumulation of phytonutrients. This information can be used to identify alleles for breeding crops that allow for efficient utilization of organic inputs.\\n\\nSignificance statementOrganic fertilizer changes the expression of the tomato genome, induces photosynthetic stress which elicits higher production of secondary metabolites.",

    "abstract": "European pears (Pyrus communis L.) require a range of cold-temperature exposure to induce ethylene biosynthesis and fruit ripening. Physiological and hormonal responses to cold temperature storage in pear have been well characterized, but the molecular underpinnings of these phenomena remain unclear. An established low-temperature conditioning model was used to induce ripening of  DAnjou and  Bartlett pear cultivars and quantify the expression of key genes representing ripening-related metabolic pathways in comparison to non-conditioned fruit. Physiological indicators of pear ripening were recorded, and fruit peel tissue sampled in parallel, during the cold-conditioning and ripening time-course experiment to correlate gene expression to ontogeny. Two complementary approaches, Nonparametric Multi-Dimensional Scaling and efficiency-corrected 2-({Delta}{Delta}Ct), were used to identify genes exhibiting the most variability in expression. Interestingly, the enhanced alternative oxidase (AOX) transcript abundance at the pre-climacteric stage in  Bartlett and  DAnjou at the peak of the conditioning treatments suggests that AOX may play a key and a novel role in the achievement of ripening competency. There were indications that cold-sensing and signaling elements from ABA and auxin pathways modulate the S1-S2 ethylene transition in European pears, and that the S1-S2 ethylene biosynthesis transition is more pronounced in  Bartlett as compared to  DAnjou pear. This information has implications in preventing post-harvest losses of this important crop.",

Pinus is divided into two subgenera, Strobus, and Pinus by the number of vascular bundles present in the needles. Comprehensive and detailed anatomy of needles in ten species of Pinus using nine anatomical traits was carried out. These morphological and anatomical traits supported the classification of the genus up to section level. It was observed that number of needles per fascicle varied along with other related traits such as thickness and width of vascular bundles, the diameter of resin ducts, the thickness of epidermis and thickness and width of endodermal cells that show remarkable variations among different species selected for the present study. The data can be used as a tool for identification and classification of Pinus upto genus and species level. We also found that similarity and differences in leaf anatomical traits supported the molecular phylogeny of Pinus conducted by several researchers.",

    "abstract": "The importance of increasing photosynthetic efficiency for sustainable crop yield increases to feed the growing world population is well recognized. The natural genetic variation for leaf photosynthesis in crop plants is largely unexploited for increasing genetic yield potential. The genus Oryza, including cultivated rice and wild relatives, offers tremendous genetic variability to explore photosynthetic differences, and underlying biochemical, photochemical, and developmental bases. We quantified leaf photosynthesis and related physiological parameters for six cultivated and three wild rice genotypes, and identified photosynthetically efficient wild rice accessions. Fitting A/Ci curves and biochemical analyses showed that the leaf photosynthesis in cultivated rice varieties, IR64 and Nipponbare, was limited due to leaf nitrogen content, Rubisco activity, and electron transport rate compared to photosynthetically efficient accessions of wild rice Oryza australiensis and Oryza latifolia. The selected wild rice accessions with high leaf photosynthesis per unit area had striking anatomical features, such as larger mesophyll cells with more chloroplasts, fewer mesophyll cells between two consecutive veins, and higher mesophyll cell and chloroplast surface area exposed to intercellular space. Our results show the existence of desirable variations in Rubisco activity, electron transport rate, and leaf anatomical features in the rice system itself that could be targeted for increasing the photosynthetic efficiency of cultivated rice varieties.\n\nHighlightDistinct leaf biochemical, photochemical, and developmental features contribute to efficient photosynthesis in the selected wild rice accessions that could potentially be exploited to increase rice leaf photosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "Karrikins (KARs), smoke-derived butenolides, are perceived by the /{beta}-fold hydrolase KARRIKIN INSENSITIVE2 (KAI2) and are thought to mimic endogenous, yet elusive plant hormones tentatively called KAI2-ligands (KLs). The sensitivity to different karrikin types as well as the number of KAI2 paralogs varies among plant species, suggesting diversification and co-evolution of ligand-receptor relationships. In legumes, which comprise a number of important crops with protein-rich, nutritious seed, KAI2 has duplicated. We report sub-functionalization of KAI2a and KAI2b in the model legume Lotus japonicus and demonstrate that their ability to bind the synthetic ligand GR24ent-5DS differs in vitro as well as in genetic assays in Lotus japonicus and in the heterologous Arabidopsis thaliana background. These differences can be explained by the exchange of a widely conserved phenylalanine in the binding pocket of KAI2a with a tryptophan in KAI2b, which occured independently in KAI2 proteins of several unrelated angiosperms. Furthermore, two polymorphic residues in the binding pocket are conserved across a number of legumes and may contribute to ligand binding preferences. Unexpectedly, L. japonicus responds to diverse synthetic KAI2-ligands in an organ-specific manner. Hypocotyl development responds to KAR1, KAR2 and rac-GR24, while root system development responds only to KAR1. This organ-specificity cannot be explained by receptor-ligand preferences alone, because LjKAI2a is sufficient for karrikin responses in the hypocotyl, while LjKAI2a and LjKAI2b operate redundantly in roots. Our findings open novel research avenues into the evolution and diversity of butenolide ligand-receptor relationships, their ecological significance and the mechanisms controlling diverse developmental responses to different KAI2 ligands.",

    "abstract": "Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) a bioactive lipid is produced in its primary reservoir, erythrocytes by an enzyme Sphingosine kinase-1 (SphK-1). The activation of such kinases and the subsequent S1P generation and secretion in the blood serum represent a major regulator of many cellular signaling cascades. Orthologue of sphingosine kinases 1 and 2 (SphK-1 and 2) that catalyze the phosphorylation of sphingosine generating S1P are not present in malaria parasite. The malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, is an intracellular obligatory organism that reside in the human erythrocyte during its blood stage life cycle and orchestrates many metabolic interactions with host for its survival. Given the regulatory role of S1P, we targeted host SphK-1 by a generic pharmacological inhibitor N,N-Dimethyl-sphingosine (DMS) and analyzed growth of intra-erythrocytic parasite. We found that reducing S1P levels by inhibiting host SphK-1 activity led to halted parasite growth and ultimately cell death. Reduced intracellular S1P levels were attributed to decreased glycolysis marked by the low uptake of glucose by parasite and by less production of lactate, a byproduct of glycolysis. Reduced glycolysis was mediated by decrease translocation of the glycolytic enzyme, Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) to the cytosol of infected erythrocytes and cell death. Knocking down of erythrocyte SphK-1 is not lethal to the host and being a host encoded enzyme, targeting it with safe and specific drugs will not lead to the problem of resistance; thus, SphK-1 represents a potent target for the development of therapeutics against intra-erythrocytic P. falciparum.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryErythrocytes membrane enzyme Sphingosine kinase-1 (SphK-1) produces Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) a bioactive lipid by phosphorylation of Sphingosine (Sph).

    "abstract": "Spermatozoa are the most morphologically variable cell type, yet little is known about genes controlling natural variation in sperm shape. Drosophila fruit flies have the longest sperm known, which are evolving under postcopulatory sexual selection, driven by sperm competition and cryptic female choice. Long sperm outcompete short sperm but primarily when females have a long seminal receptacle (SR), the primary sperm storage organ. Thus, selection on sperm length is mediated by SR length, and the two traits are coevolving across the Drosophila lineage, driven by a genetic correlation and fitness advantage of long sperm and long SR genotypes in both males and females. Ecdysone induced protein 74EF (Eip74EF) is expressed during post-meiotic stages of spermatogenesis, when spermatid elongation occurs, and we found that it is rapidly evolving under positive selection in Drosophila. Hypomorphic knockout of the E74A isoform leads to shorter sperm but does not affect SR length, suggesting that E74A may be involved in promoting spermatid elongation but is not a genetic driver of male-female coevolution. We also found that E74A knockout has opposing effects on fecundity in males and females, with an increase in fecundity for males but a decrease in females, consistent with its documented role in oocyte maturation. Our results suggest a novel function of Eip74EF in spermatogenesis and demonstrates that this gene influences both male and female reproductive success. We speculate on possible roles for E74A in spermatogenesis and male reproductive success.\n\nRESEARCH HIGHLIGHTSEip74EF promotes oocyte maturation in Drosophila. We found evidence that it also promotes sperm elongation in males, but at a cost to male fecundity. Mutant males have shorter sperm but have higher reproductive success, while females have reduced fecundity.",

    "abstract": "Matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3 or stromelysin 1) participates in normal extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover during embryonic development, organ morphogenesis and wound healing, and in tissue-destructive diseases, such as aneurysm, cancer, arthritis and heart failure. Despite its ability to hydrolyse numerous proteins in the ECM, MMP-3 fails to cleave the triple helix of interstitial fibrillar collagens. Nonetheless, it can still bind to these collagens although the mechanism, location and role of binding are not known. We used the Collagen Toolkits, libraries of triple-helical peptides that embrace the entire helical domains of collagens II and III, to map MMP-3 interaction sites. The enzyme recognises five sites on collagen II and three sites on collagen III. They share a glycine-phenylalanine-hydroxyproline/alanine (GFO/A) motif that is recognised by the enzyme in a context-dependent manner. Neither MMP-3 zymogen (proMMP-3) nor the individual catalytic (Cat) and hemopexin (Hpx) domains of MMP-3 interact with the peptides, revealing cooperative binding of both domains to the triple helix. The Toolkit binding data combined with molecular modelling enabled us to deduce the putative collagen-binding mode of MMP-3, where all three collagen chains make contacts with the enzyme in the valley running across both Cat and Hpx domains. The observed binding pattern casts light on how MMP-3 could regulate collagen turnover and compete with various collagen-binding proteins regulating cell adhesion and proliferation.",

The fetal genetic component has been previously shown to contribute significantly to the timing of birth, yet little is known about the identity and behavior of individual genes.\\n\\nObjectivesThe aim of this study was to test the extent genome-wide DNA methylation levels in umbilical cord blood were associated with gestational age at birth (GA). Findings were validated in an independent sample and evidence for the regulation of gene expression was evaluated for cis gene relationships in matched specimens.\\n\\nResultsGenome-wide DNA methylation, measured by the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450K BeadChip, was associated with GA for 2,372 CpG probes (5% false discovery rate) in both the Pregnancy, Race, Environment, Genes (PREG - Virginia Commonwealth University) and Newborn Epigenetic Study (NEST - Duke University) cohorts. Significant probes mapped to 1,640 characterized genes and an association with nearby gene expression measures obtained by the Affymetrix HG-133A microarray was found for 11 genes. Differentially methylated positions were enriched for actively transcribed and enhancer chromatin states, were predominately located outside of CpG islands, and mapped to genes enriched for inflammation and innate immunity ontologies. In both PREG and NEST, the first principal component derived from these probes explained approximately one-half (58.1% and 47.8%, respectively) of the variation in GA. This assessment provides a strong evidence to support the importance of DNAm change throughout the gestational time period.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results converge on support for the role of variation in DNAm measures as an important genetic regulatory mechanism contributing to inter-individual differences in gestational age at birth.

    "abstract": "Descending command neurons instruct spinal networks to execute basic locomotor functions, such as which gait and what speed. The command functions for gait and speed are symmetric, implying that a separate unknown system directs asymmetric movements--the ability to move left or right. Here we report the discovery that Chx10-lineage reticulospinal neurons act to control the direction of locomotor movements in mammals. Chx10 neurons exhibit ipsilateral projection, and can decrease spinal limb-based locomotor activity ipsilaterally. This circuit mechanism acts as the basis for left or right locomotor movements in freely moving animals: selective unilateral activation of Chx10 neurons causes ipsilateral movements whereas inhibition causes contralateral movements. Spontaneous forward locomotion is thus transformed into an ipsilateral movement by braking locomotion on the ipsilateral side. We identify sensorimotor brain regions that project onto Chx10 reticulospinal neurons, and demonstrate that their unilateral activation can impart left/right directional commands. Together these data identify the descending motor system which commands left/right locomotor asymmetries in mammals.",

Here, we examine network-based mechanisms in the mouse preB[o]tzinger complex using substance P, a potent excitatory modulator of breathing frequency and stability, as a tool to dissect network properties that underlie dynamic breathing. We find that substance P does not alter the balance of excitation and inhibition during breaths or the duration of the resulting refractory period. Instead, mechanisms of recurrent excitation between breaths are enhanced such that the rate that excitation percolates through the network is increased. Based on our results, we propose a conceptual framework in which three distinct phases, the inspiratory phase, refractory phase, and percolation phase, can be differentially modulated to influence breathing dynamics and stability. Unravelling mechanisms that support this dynamic control may improve our understanding of nervous system disorders that destabilize breathing, many of which are associated with changes in brainstem neuromodulatory systems.",

Adverse experiences during childhood increase risk for mental illness, however it is currently unclear whether stress early in life plays a direct role in the development of social difficulties.

We also explored social performance and AVP expression in participants with borderline personality disorder (BPD) who experienced a high incidence of childhood stress. Social behaviour was impaired and AVP expression increased in animals experiencing PPS and participants with BPD. Behavioural deficits in animals were rescued through administration of the AVP receptor 1a antagonist Relcovaptan (SR49059).

    "abstract": "Mutations in coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain containing 10 (CHCHD10) are a genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and/or frontotemporal dementia (ALS-FTD). To elucidate how mutations in CHCHD10 induce disease, we generated a Drosophila melanogaster model of CHCHD10-mediated ALS-FTD. Expression of CHCHD10S59L in Drosophila caused gain-of-function toxicity in eyes, motor neurons, and muscles, in addition to mitochondrial defects in flies and HeLa cells. TDP-43 and PINK1 formed two axes, driving the mutant-dependent phenotypes. CHCHD10S59L expression increased TDP-43 insolubility and mitochondrial translocation. Blocking mitochondrial translocation with a peptide inhibitor reduced CHCHD10S59L-mediated toxicity. PINK1 knockdown rescued CHCHD10S59L-mediated phenotypes in Drosophila and HeLa cells. The two PINK1 substrates mitofusin and mitofilin were genetic modifiers of this phenotype. Mitofusin agonists reversed the CHCHD10S59L-induced phenotypes in Drosophila and HeLa cells and increased ATP production in Drosophila expressing C9orf72 with expanded GGGGCC repeats. Two peptides inhibitors of PINK1 mitigated the mitochondrial defects introduced by CHCHD10S59L expression. These findings indicate that TDP-43 mitochondrial translocation and chronic activation of PINK1-mediated pathways by CHCHD10S59L generate dominant toxicity. Therefore, inhibiting PINK1 activity may provide a therapeutic strategy for CHCHD10-associated disease.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryInhibition of TDP-43 mitochondrial translocation or PINK1 kinase activity mitigates CHCHD10S59L-mediated mitochondrial toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Understanding constraints on the functional properties of biomolecular circuit dynamics, such as the variation of amplitude and timescale of pulse, is an important part of biomolecular circuit design. While the amplitude-timescale co-variations of the pulse in an incoherent feedforward loop have been investigated computationally using mathematical models, experimental support for such constraints is relatively unclear. Here, we address this using experimental measurements of an existing pulse generating incoherent feedforward loop circuit realization in the context of a standard mathematical model. We characterize the trends of co-variation in the pulse amplitude and rise time computationally by randomly exploring the parameter space. We experimentally measured the co-variation by varying inducers and found that larger amplitude pulses have slower rise time. We discuss the gap between the experimental measurements and predictions of the standard model, highlighting model additions and other biological factors that might bridge the gap.",

    "abstract": "To engineer Mo dependent nitrogenase function in plants expression of proteins NifD and NifK will be an absolute requirement. Although mitochondria have been established as a suitable eukaryotic environment for biosynthesis of oxygen-sensitive enzymes such as NifH, expression of NifD in this organelle has proven difficult due to cryptic NifD degradation. Here we describe a solution to this problem. Using molecular and proteomic methods, we found NifD degradation to be a consequence of mitochondrial endoprotease activity at a specific motif within NifD. Focusing on this functionally sensitive region, we designed NifD variants comprising between one and three amino acid substitutions and distinguished several that were resistant to degradation when expressed in both plant and yeast mitochondria. Nitrogenase activity assays of these resistant variants in E. coli identified a subset that retained function, including a single amino acid (Y100Q) variant. The Y100Q variant also enabled expression of a NifD(Y100Q)-linker-NifK translational polyprotein in plant mitochondria, confirmed by identification of the polyprotein in the soluble fraction of plant extracts. The NifD(Y100Q)-linker-NifK retained function in E. coli based nitrogenase assays, demonstrating this polyprotein permits expression of NifD and NifK in a defined stoichiometry supportive of activity. Our results exemplify how protein design can overcome impediments encountered when expressing synthetic proteins in novel environments. Specifically, these findings outline our progress toward the assembly of the catalytic unit of nitrogenase within mitochondria.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression control based on CRISPRi (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference) has emerged as a powerful tool for creating synthetic gene circuits, both in prokaryotes and in eukaryotes; yet, its lack of cooperativity has been pointed out as a potential obstacle for dynamic or multistable circuit construction. Here we use CRISPRi to build prominent synthetic gene circuits in Escherichia coli. We report the first-ever CRISPRi oscillator (\"CRISPRlator\"), bistable network (toggle switch) and stripe pattern-forming incoherent feed-forward loop (IFFL). Our circuit designs, conceived to feature high predictability and orthogonality, as well as low metabolic burden and context-dependency, allowed us to achieve robust circuit behaviors. Mathematical modeling suggests that unspecific binding in CRISPRi is essential to establish multistability. Our work demonstrates the wide applicability of CRISPRi in synthetic circuits and paves the way for future efforts towards engineering more complex synthetic networks, boosted by the advantages of CRISPR technology.",

    "abstract": "The actin cytoskeleton plays a key role in differentiation of human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs), but its regulation in 3D tissue engineered scaffolds remains poorly studied. hMSCs cultured on 3D electrospun scaffolds made of a stiff material do not form actin stress fibers, contrary to hMSCs on 2D films of the same material. On 3D electrospun- and 3D additive manufactured scaffolds, hMSCs also displayed fewer focal adhesions, lower lamin A and C expression and less YAP1 nuclear localization. Together, this shows that dimensionality prevents the build-up of cellular tension, even on stiff materials. Knock down of either lamin A and C or zyxin resulted in fewer stress fibers in the cell center. Zyxin knock down reduced lamin A and C expression, but not vice versa, showing that this signal chain starts from the outside of the cell. Our study demonstrates that dimensionality changes the actin cytoskeleton through lamin A and C and zyxin, an important insight for future scaffold design, as the actin network, focal adhesions and nuclear stiffness are all critical for hMSC differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Chromosome movements and programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) promote homologue pairing and initiate recombination at meiosis onset. Meiotic progression involves checkpoint-controlled termination of these events when all homologue pairs achieve synapsis and form crossover precursors. We show that termination of chromosome movement and DSB formation is reversible and is continuously implemented by the synaptonemal complex (SC), which silences chromosome signals that promote CHK-2 activity. Forced removal of the SC or different meiosis-specific cohesin complexes, which are individually required for SC stability, causes rapid CHK-2-dependent reinstallation of the DSB-formation and chromosome-movement machinery. This nuclear reorganization occurs without transcriptional changes, but requires signalling from HORMA protein HTP-1. Conversely, CHK-2 inactivation causes rapid disassembly of the DSB-formation and chromosome-movement machinery. Thus, nuclear organization is constantly controlled by the level of CHK-2 activity. Our results uncover an unexpected plasticity of the meiotic program and show how chromosome signalling integrates nuclear organization with meiotic progression.",

    "abstract": "Cardiomyocyte (CM) proliferative potential varies considerably across species. While lower vertebrates and neonatal mammals retain robust capacities for CM proliferation, adult mammalian CMs lose proliferative potential due to cell-cycle withdrawal and polyploidization, failing to mount a proliferative response to regenerate lost CMs after cardiac injury. The decline of murine CM proliferative potential occurs in the neonatal period when the endocrine system undergoes drastic changes for adaptation to extrauterine life. We recently demonstrated that thyroid hormone (TH) signaling functions as a primary factor driving CM proliferative potential loss in vertebrates. Whether other hormonal pathways govern this process remains largely unexplored. Here we showed that agonists of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and vitamin D receptor (VDR) suppressed neonatal CM proliferation in vitro. We next examined CM nucleation and proliferation in mutant mice lacking GR or VDR specifically in CMs, but we observed no difference between mutant and control littermates. Additionally, we generated compound mutant mice that lack GR or VDR and express dominant-negative TH receptor alpha in their CMs, and similarly observed no increase in CM proliferative potential compared to dominant-negative TH receptor alpha mice alone. Thus, although GR and VDR activation in cultured CMs is sufficient to inhibit CM proliferation, they seem to be dispensable for CM cell-cycle exit and binucleation in vivo. In addition, given the recent report that VDR activation in zebrafish promotes CM proliferation and tissue regeneration, our results suggest distinct roles of VDR in zebrafish and rodent CM cell-cycle regulation.",

    "abstract": "Muller glia can serve as a source for retinal regeneration in some non-mammalian vertebrates. Recently we found that this process can be induced in mouse Muller glia after injury, by combining transgenic expression of the proneural transcription factor Ascl1 and the HDAC inhibitor TSA. However, new neurons are only generated from a subset of Muller glia in this model, and identifying factors that limit Ascl1-mediated MG reprogramming could potentially make this process more efficient, and potentially useful clinically. One factor that limits neurogenesis in some non-mammalian vertebrates is the STAT pathway activation that occurs in Muller glia in response to injury. In this report, we tested whether injury induced STAT activation hampers the ability of Ascl1 to reprogram Muller glia into retinal neurons. Using a STAT inhibitor, in combination with our previously described reprogramming paradigm, we found a large increase in the ability of Muller glia to generate neurons, similar to those we described previously. Single-cell RNA-seq showed that the progenitor-like cells derived from Ascl1-expressing Muller glia have a higher level of STAT signaling than those that become neurons. Using Ascl1 ChIP-seq and DNase-seq, we found that developmentally inappropriate Ascl1 binding sites (that were unique to the overexpression context) had enrichment for the STAT binding motif. This study provides evidence that STAT pathway activation reduces the efficiency of Ascl1-mediated reprogramming in Muller glia, potentially by directing Ascl1 to inappropriate targets.",

    "abstract": "Postnatal mammalian cardiomyocytes undergo a major transition from hyperplasia (increases in cell numbers) to hypertrophy (expansion in cell size). This process is accompanied by rapid mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolic switches to meet the demand of increased cardiac output. Although most mitochondrial components express ubiquitously, recent transcriptomic and proteomic analyses have discovered numerous tissue-specific mitochondrial proteins whose physiological functions are largely unknown. Here we report that a highly evolutionarily conserved mitochondrial protein Coq10a is predominantly expressed in mammalian cardiac and skeletal muscles, and is highly up-regulated around birth in a thyroid hormone-dependent manner. Deletion of Coq10a by CRISPR/Cas9 leads to enhanced cardiac growth after birth. Surprisingly, adult Coq10a mutant mice maintain the hypertrophic heart phenotype with increased levels of coenzyme Q (CoQ) per cardiomyocyte, preserved cardiac contractile function and mitochondrial respiration, which contrasts with reported mice and humans with mutations in other Coq family genes. Further RNA-seq analysis and mitochondrial characterization suggest an increase of mitochondrial biogenesis in the Coq10a mutant heart as a possible consequence of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1) activation, consistent with a recent intriguing report that CoQ may function as a natural ligand and partial agonist of Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor (PPAR) /{gamma}. Taken together, our study reveals a previously unknown function of a novel striated muscle-enriched mitochondrial protein Coq10a in regulating postnatal heart growth.",

In humans, CHMP2 exists as two potential isoforms, CHMP2A and CHMP2B, but their physical characteristics have not been compared yet. Here, we use a combination of technics on biomimetic systems and purified proteins to study their affinity and effects on membranes. We establish that CHMP2B binding is enhanced in the presence of PI(4,5)P2 lipids. In contrast, CHMP2A does not display lipid specificity and requires CHMP3 for binding significantly to membranes. On the micrometer scale and at moderate bulk concentrations, CHMP2B forms a reticular structure on membranes whereas CHMP2A (+CHMP3) binds homogeneously. Eventually, CHMP2A and CHMP2B unexpectedly induce different mechanical effects to membranes: CHMP2B strongly rigidifies them while CHMP2A (+CHMP3) has no significant effect. Altogether, we conclude that CHMP2B and CHMP2A cannot be considered as isoforms and might thus contribute differently to membrane remodeling processes.",

    "abstract": "Diseases and damage to the retina lead to losses in retinal neurons and eventual visual impairment. Although the mammalian retina has no inherent regenerative capabilities, fish have robust regeneration from Muller glia (MG). Recently, we have shown that driving expression of Ascl1 in adult mouse MG stimulates neurogenesis similar to fish regeneration. The regeneration observed in the mouse is limited in the variety of neurons that can be derived from MG; Ascl1-expressing MG primarily generate bipolar cells. To better understand the limits of MG-based regeneration in mouse retinas, we used ATAC- and RNA-seq to compare newborn progenitors with MG. Our analysis demonstrated striking similarities between MG and progenitors, with losses in regulatory motifs for neurogenesis genes. Young MG were found to have intermediate expression profiles and accessible DNA, which is mirrored in the ability of Ascl1 to direct bipolar neurogenesis in young MG. When comparing what makes bipolar and photoreceptor cells distinct from glial cells, we find that bipolar-specific accessible regions are more frequently linked to bHLH motifs and Ascl1 binding, indicating that Ascl1 preferentially binds to bipolar regions. Overall, our analysis indicates a loss of neurogenic gene expression and motif accessibility during glial maturation that may prevent efficient reprogramming.",

We established conditions for long-term culture of adult mouse cardiomyocytes that are genetically labeled with fluorescence. This technique permits reliable analyses of proliferation of pre-existing cardiomyocytes without complications from cardiomyocyte marker expression loss due to dedifferentiation or significant contribution from cardiac progenitor cell expansion and differentiation in culture. Using this system, we took a candidate gene approach to screen for fetal-specific proliferative gene programs that can induce proliferation of adult mouse cardiomyocytes. Using pooled gene delivery and subtractive gene elimination, we identified a novel functional interaction between E2f Transcription Factor 2 (E2f2) and Brain Expressed X-Linked (Bex)/Transcription elongation factor A-like (Tceal) superfamily members Bex1 and Tceal8. Specifically, Bex1 and Tceal8 both preserved cell viability during E2f2-induced cell cycle re-entry. Although Tceal8 inhibited E2f2-induced S-phase re-entry, Bex1 facilitated DNA synthesis while inhibiting cell death. In sum, our study provides a valuable method for adult cardiomyocyte proliferation research and suggests that Bex family proteins may function in modulating cell proliferation and death decisions during cardiomyocyte development and maturation.",

    "abstract": "When investigating neural circuits, a standard limitation of the in vitro patch clamp approach is that axons from multiple sources are often intermixed, making it difficult to isolate inputs from individual sources with electrical stimulation. However, by using channelrhodopsin assisted circuit mapping (CRACM) this limitation can now be overcome. Here, we report a method to use CRACM to map ascending inputs from lower auditory brainstem nuclei and commissural inputs to an identified class of neurons in the inferior colliculus (IC), the midbrain nucleus of the auditory system. In the IC, local, commissural, ascending, and descending axons are heavily intertwined and therefore indistinguishable with electrical stimulation. By injecting a viral construct to drive expression of a channelrhodopsin in a presynaptic nucleus, followed by patch clamp recording to characterize the presence and physiology of channelrhodopsin-expressing synaptic inputs, projections from a specific source to a specific population of IC neurons can be mapped with cell type-specific accuracy. We show that this approach works with both Chronos, a blue light-activated channelrhodopsin, and ChrimsonR, a red-shifted channelrhodopsin. In contrast to previous reports from the forebrain, we find that ChrimsonR is robustly trafficked down the axons of dorsal cochlear nucleus principal neurons, indicating that ChrimsonR may be a useful tool for CRACM experiments in the brainstem. The protocol presented here includes detailed descriptions of the intracranial virus injection surgery, including stereotaxic coordinates for targeting injections to the dorsal cochlear nucleus and IC of mice, and how to combine whole cell patch clamp recording with channelrhodopsin activation to investigate long-range projections to IC neurons. Although this protocol is tailored to characterizing auditory inputs to the IC, it can be easily adapted to investigate other long-range projections in the auditory brainstem and beyond.\\n\\nSUMMARYChannelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping (CRACM) is a precision technique for functional mapping of long-range neuronal projections between anatomically and/or genetically identified groups of neurons. Here, we describe how to utilize CRACM to map auditory brainstem connections, including the use of a red-shifted opsin, ChrimsonR.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of the adaptive immune system has provided vertebrates with a uniquely sophisticated immune toolkit, enabling them to mount precise immune responses against a staggeringly diverse range of antigens. Like other vertebrates, teleost fishes possess a complex and functional adaptive immune system; however, our knowledge of the complex antigen-receptor genes underlying its functionality has been restricted to a small number of experimental and agricultural species, preventing a systematic investigation of how these crucial gene loci evolve. Here, we analyse the genomic structure of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) gene loci in the cyprinodontiforms, a diverse and important group of teleosts present in many different habitats across the world. We reconstruct the complete IGH loci of the turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri) and the southern platyfish (Xiphophorus maculatus) and analyse their in vivo gene expression, revealing the presence of species-specific splice isoforms of transmembrane IGHM. We further characterise the IGH constant regions of ten additional cyprinodontiform species, including guppy, amazon molly, mummichog and mangrove killifish. Phylogenetic analysis of these constant regions reveals multiple independent rounds of duplication and deletion of the teleost-specific antibody class IGHZ in the cyprinodontiform lineage, demonstrating the extreme volatility of IGH evolution. Focusing on the cyprinodontiforms as a model taxon for comparative evolutionary immunology, this work provides novel genomic resources for studying adaptive immunity and sheds light on the evolutionary history of the adaptive immune system.",

    "abstract": "The Allen mesoscale mouse brain structural connectome is analysed using standard network methods combined with 3D visualizations. The full region-to-region connectivity data is used, with a focus on the strongest structural links. The spatial embedding of links and time evolution of signalling is incorporated, with two-step links included. Modular decomposition using the Infomap method produces 8 network modules that correspond approximately to major brain anatomical regions and system functions. These modules align with the anterior and posterior primary sensory systems and association areas. 3D visualization of network links is facilitated by using a set of simplified schematic coordinates that reduces visual complexity. Selection of key nodes and links, such as sensory pathways and cortical association areas together reveal structural features of the mouse structural connectome consistent with biological functions in the sensory-motor systems, and selective roles of the anterior and posterior cortical association areas of the mouse brain. Time progression of signals along sensory pathways reveals that close links are to local cortical association areas and cross modal, while longer links provide anterior-posterior coordination and inputs to non cortical regions. The fabric of weaker links generally are longer range with some having brain-wide reach. Cortical gradients are evident along sensory pathways within the structural network.\\n\\nAuthors SummaryNetwork models incorporating spatial embedding and signalling delays are used to investigate the mouse structural connectome. Network models that include time respecting paths are used to trace signaling pathways and reveal separate roles of shorter vs. longer links. Here computational methods work like experimental probes to uncover biologically relevant features. I use the Infomap method, which follows random walks on the network, to decompose the directed, weighted network into 8 modules that align with classical brain anatomical regions and system functions. Primary sensory pathways and cortical association areas are separated into individual modules. Strong, short range links form the sensory-motor paths while weaker links spread brain-wide, possibly coordinating many regions.",

    "abstract": "There exist two major types of striatum-targeting neocortical neurons, specifically, intratelencephalic (IT) neurons and pyramidal-tract (PT) neurons. Regarding their striatal projections, it was once suggested that IT axons are extended whereas PT axons are primarily focal. However, subsequent study with an increased number of well-stained extended axons concluded that such an apparent distinction was spurious due to limited sample size. Recent work using genetically labeled neurons reintroduced the differential spatial extent of the striatal projections of IT and PT neurons through population-level analyses, complemented by observations of single axons. However, quantitative analysis of a large number of axons remained to be conducted. We analyzed the data of axonal end-points of 161 IT neurons and 33 PT neurons in the MouseLight database (http://ml-neuronbrowser.janelia.org/). The number of axonal end-points in the ipsilateral striatum exhibits roughly monotonically decreasing distributions in both neuron types. However, the proportion of neurons having >50 ipsilateral end-points is larger in IT neurons than in PT neurons. Moreover, distinguishing IT subpopulations in the secondary motor area (MOs), layer 5 neurons and bilateral striatum-targeting layer 2/3 neurons, but not contralateral striatum-non-targeting layer 2/3 neurons, have a larger number of ipsilateral end-points than MOs PT neurons. We also found that IT ipsilateral striatal axonal end-points are on average more widely distributed than PT end-points, especially in the medial-lateral direction. These results indicate that IT and PT striatal axons differ in the frequency of having numerous end-points and the spatial extent of end-points while there are wide varieties within each neuron type.",

    "abstract": "Neural computation relies on the integration of synaptic inputs across a neurons dendritic arbour. However, the fundamental rules that govern dendritic integration are far from understood. In particular, it is still unclear how cell type-specific differences in dendritic integration arise from general features of neural morphology and membrane properties. Here, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which relay the visual systems first computations to the brain, represent an exquisite model. They are functionally and morphologically diverse yet defined, and they allow studying dendritic integration in a functionally relevant context. Here, we show how four morphologically distinct types of mouse RGC with shared excitatory synaptic input (transient Off alpha, transient Off mini, sustained Off, and F-miniOff) exhibit distinct dendritic integration rules. Using two-photon imaging of dendritic calcium signals and biophysical modelling, we demonstrate that these RGC types strongly differ in their spatio-temporal dendritic integration: In transient Off alpha cells, dendritic receptive fields displayed little spatial overlap, indicative of a dendritic arbour that is partitioned in largely isolated regions. In contrast, dendritic receptive fields in the other three RGCs overlapped greatly and were offset to the soma, suggesting strong synchronization of dendritic signals likely due to backpropagation of somatic signals. Also temporal correlation of dendritic signals varied extensively among these types, with transient Off mini cells displaying the highest correlation across their dendritic arbour. Modelling suggests that morphology alone cannot explain these differences in dendritic integration, but instead specific combinations of dendritic morphology and ion channel densities are required. Together, our results reveal how neurons exhibit distinct dendritic integration profiles tuned towards their type-specific computations in their circuits, with the interplay between morphology and ion channel complement as a key contributor.",

    "abstract": "Despite the importance of dendritic arbors for proper neuronal function, our knowledge of how sensory experience influences these structures during postnatal cortical development is incomplete. We present a large-scale dataset of 849 three-dimensional reconstructions of pyramidal neuron basal arbors collected across early postnatal development in the mouse visual cortex. We found that the basal arbor underwent a 45% increase in total length between postnatal day 7 (P7) and P30. Surprisingly, comparisons of dark-reared and typically-reared mice revealed that only 15% of arbor length could be attributed to visual experience. Furthermore, we characterized the role of the activity-regulated small GTPase Rem2, showing that Rem2 is an experience-dependent negative regulator of dendritic segment number during the visual critical period. These data establish a detailed, quantitative analysis of the basal arbor that has high utility for understanding circuit development and providing a framework for computationalists wishing to generate anatomically accurate neuronal models.",

    "abstract": "In response to noxious stimuli, planarians cease their typical ciliary gliding and exhibit an oscillatory type of locomotion called scrunching. We have previously characterized the biomechanics of scrunching and shown that it is induced by specific stimuli, such as amputation, noxious heat, and extreme pH. Because these specific inducers are known to activate Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels in other systems, we hypothesized that TRP channels control scrunching. We found that chemicals known to activate TRPA1 (allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) and hydrogen peroxide) and TRPV (capsaicin and anandamide) in other systems induce scrunching in the planarian species Dugesia japonica and, except for anandamide, in Schmidtea mediterranea. To confirm that these responses were specific to either TRPA1 or TRPV, respectively, we tried to block scrunching using selective TRPA1 or TRPV antagonists and RNA interference (RNAi) mediated knockdown. Unexpectedly, co-treatment with a mammalian TRPA1 antagonist, HC-030031, enhanced AITC-induced scrunching by decreasing the latency time, suggesting an agonistic relationship in planarians. We further confirmed that TRPA1 in both species is necessary for AITC-induced scrunching using RNAi. Conversely, while co-treatment of a mammalian TRPV antagonist, SB-366791, also enhanced capsaicin-induced reactions in D. japonica, combined knockdown of two previously identified D. japonica TRPV genes (DjTRPVa and DjTRPVb) did not inhibit capsaicin-induced scrunching. Surprisingly, RNAi of either DjTRPAa or DjTRPVa/DjTRPVb disrupted scrunching induced by the endocannabinoid and TRPV agonist, anandamide. Overall, our results show that although scrunching induction can involve different initial pathways for sensing stimuli, this behaviors signature dynamical features are independent of the inducer, implying that scrunching is a stereotypical planarian escape behavior in response to various noxious stimuli that converge on a single downstream pathway. Understanding which aspects of nociception are conserved or not across different organisms can provide insight into the underlying regulatory mechanisms to better understand pain sensation.",

While most CP studies have also investigated the macroscopic brain vascular system, its microstructural architecture still remains largely unexplored. Further, the adaptive modifications of the vascular microstructure as consequence of diseases or pathological insults, did not receive adequate attention. Here we show microtomographic signs of diffuse and conspicuous microvascular neogenesis in somatosensory cortex of CP animal models already peaking at 15 days from the model instantiation. Progressive fading of this microvessel neogenesis then ensued in the next six months yet maintaining higher vascular density with a preserved small fraction of them. Due to the important consequences on the neuron-glial-vessel arrangements and on the resulting metabolic and functional disorders of the local networks, novel additional scenarios of CP are thus conceivable with profound consequences of potential future CP diagnostic and therapeutic appraisals.",

    "abstract": "The alcoholism and major depressive disorder are common comorbidity, with alcohol-induced depressive symptoms being eased by selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), although the mechanisms underlying pathology and therapy are poorly understood. Chronic alcohol consumption affects the activity of serotonin 2C receptors (5-HT2CR) by regulating adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) in neurones. Astrogliopathic changes contribute to alcohol addiction, while decreased release of ATP from astrocytes can trigger depressive-like behaviours in mice. In this study, we discovered that chronic alcohol addiction increased editing of RNA of 5-HT2CR via up-regulating the expression of ADAR2, consequnetly reducing the release of ATP from astrocytes induced by 5-HT2CR agonist, MK212. At the same time SSRI antidepressant fluoxetine decreased the expression of ADAR2 through the transactivation of EGFR/PI3K/AKT/cFos signalling pathway. Reduction in ADAR2 activity eliminated the RNA editing of 5-HT2CR in vivo and increased release of astroglial ATP which was suppressed by chronic alcohol consumption. Meanwhile, fluoxetine improved the behavioural and motor symptoms induced by alcohol addiction and decreased the alcohol intake. Our study suggests that the astrocytic 5-HT2CR contribute to alcohol addiction; fluoxetine thus can be used to alleviate depression, treat alcohol addiction and improve motor coordination.",

    "abstract": "The vast majority of mammalian neocortex consists of a stereotypical microcircuit, the canonical cortical microcircuit (CCM), consisting of a granular input layer, positioned between superficial and deep layers. Due to this uniform layout, neuronal activation tends to follow a similar laminar sequence, with unique information extracted at each step. For example, the primate primary visual cortex (V1) combines the two eyes signals, extracts stimulus orientation and modulates its activity depending on stimulus history. Several theories have been proposed on when and where these processes happen within the CCMs laminar activation sequence, but it has been methodologically challenging to test these hypotheses. Here, we use time-resolved multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to decode information regarding the eye-of-origin, stimulus orientation and stimulus repetition from simultaneously measured spiking responses across V1s laminar microcircuit. We find that eye-of-origin information was decodable for the entire duration of stimulus presentation, but diminished in the deepest layers of V1, consistent with the notion that two eyes signals are combined within the upper layers. Conversely, orientation information was transient and equally pronounced across the microcircuit, in line with the idea that this information is relayed to other areas for further processing. Moreover, when stimuli were repeated, information regarding orientation was enhanced at the expense of eye-of origin information, suggesting that V1 modulates information flow to optimize specific stimulus dimensions. Taken together, these findings provide empirical evidence that adjudicates between long-standing hypotheses and reveals how information transfer within the CCM supports unique cortical functions.\\n\\nSignificance StatementDespite the brains daunting complexity, there are common organizing principles across brain areas. For example, neocortical activation follows a stereotypical pattern that spreads from input layers towards layers above and below. While this activation pattern is well known, it has been challenging to ascertain how unique types of information are extracted within this common sequence in different brain areas. Here we use machine learning to track the flow of stimulus-specific information across the layers of visual cortex. We found that information regarding several separate stimulus dimensions was routed uniquely within the common activation sequence in a manner that confirmed prior model predictions. This finding demonstrates how differences in information flow within the stereotypical neocortical activation sequence shape area-specific functions.",

We studied this problem using an olfactory delayed match to sample task whereby a sample odor specifies the association between a subsequent test odor and rewarding action. Multi-neuron recordings revealed representations of the sample and test odors in olfactory sensory and association cortex, which were sufficient to identify the test odor as match/non-match. Yet, inactivation of a downstream premotor area (ALM), but not orbitofrontal cortex, confined to the epoch preceding the test odor, led to gross impairment. Olfactory decisions that were not context dependent were unimpaired. Therefore, ALM may not receive the outcome of a match/non-match decision from upstream areas but contextual information--the identity of the sample--to establish the mapping between test odor and action. A novel population of pyramidal neurons in ALM layer 2 may mediate this process.",

    "abstract": "The hypothalamus is a critical regulator of many physiological processes essential for life. In the adult brain, each anatomically-defined hypothalamic nucleus consists of functionally heterogeneous neuronal subpopulations that dictate distinct survival behaviors. Nevertheless, how rich neuronal identities are established in the developing hypothalamus remains poorly understood.\\n\\nDespite their opposing actions on food intake, POMC and NPY/AgRP neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARH) are derived from the same progenitors that give rise to ARH neurons. However, the mechanism whereby common neuronal precursors subsequently adopt either the anorexigenic (POMC) or the orexigenic (NPY/AgRP) identity remains elusive.\\n\\nWe hypothesize that POMC and NPY/AgRP cell fates are specified and maintained by distinct intrinsic factors. In search of them, we profiled the transcriptomes of developing POMC and NPY/AgRP neurons with whole-genome RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Moreover, cell-type-specific transcriptomic analyses revealed transcription regulators that are selectively enriched in either population, but whose developmental functions are unknown in these neurons.\\n\\nAmong them, we found the expression of the PR domain-containing factor 12 (Prdm12) was enriched in POMC neurons but was absent in NPY/AgRP neurons. Selective ablation of Prdm12 in postmitotic POMC neurons led to early-onset obesity, accelerated linear growth, as well as impaired glucose tolerance, which recapitulates symptoms of POMC/MC4R deficiency in humans. These findings, therefore, establish a previously-unrecognized role for Prdm12 in energy balance. Furthermore, the combination of cell-type-specific genomic and genetic analyses provides a means to dissect cellular and functional diversity in the developing hypothalamus as well as the developmental origins of diverse survival behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Light is a crucial signal that regulates many aspects of plant physiology and growth including the development of stomata, the pores in the epidermal surface of the leaf. Light signals positively regulate stomatal development leading to changes in stomatal density and stomatal index (SI; the proportion of cells in the epidermis that are stomata). Both phytochrome and cryptochrome photoreceptors are required to regulate stomatal development in response to light. The transcription factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) is a key regulator of light signalling, acting downstream of photoreceptors. We hypothesised that HY5 could regulate stomatal development in response to light signals due to the putative presence of HY5 binding sites in the promoter of the STOMAGEN (STOM) gene, which encodes a peptide regulator of stomatal development. Our analysis shows that HY5 does have the potential to regulate the STOM promoter in vitro and that HY5 is expressed in both the epidermis and mesophyll. However, analysis of hy5 and hy5 hyh double mutants (HYH; HY5-HOMOLOG), found that they had normal stomatal development under different light conditions and the expression of stomatal developmental genes was not perturbed following light shift experiments. Analysis of stable lines overexpressing HY5 also showed no change in stomatal development or the expression of stomatal developmental genes. We therefore conclude that whilst HY5 has the potential to regulate the expression of STOM, it does not have a major role in regulating stomatal development in response to light signals.",

    "abstract": "Inhibition of the synthesis of a ribosomal protein (r-protein) abrogates the assembly of its cognate subunit, while assembly of the other subunit continues. Ribosomal components that are not stably incorporated into ribosomal particles due to the disrupted assembly are rapidly degraded. The 60S protein uL18/L5 is an exception, because this protein accumulates extra-ribosomally during inhibition of 60S assembly. Since the r-proteins in each ribosomal subunit are essential only for formation of their own subunit, it would be predicted that accumulation of extra-ribosomal uL18/5 only occurs during restriction of 60S assembly, and not during abolition of 40S assembly. Contrary to this prediction, we report here that repression of 40S r-protein genes does in fact lead to accumulation of uL18/L5 does outside the ribosome due modified 60S assembly. Furthermore, the effect varies depending on which 40S ribosomal protein is repressed. We propose that disruption of early steps in the 40S subunit assembly changes the kinetics of 60S subunit assembly resulting in a buildup of extra-ribosomal uL18/L5, even though 60S formation continues. Finally, our results show that maintenance of the pool of extra-ribosomal uL18/L5 requires continual protein synthesis showing that extra-ribosomal protein is not stable, but is slowly \\\"consumed\\\" by incorporation into 60S subunits and/or turnover.",
