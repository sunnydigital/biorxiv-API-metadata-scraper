    "abstract": "Genetic variants in functional regions of the genome are enriched for complex trait heritability. Here, we introduce a new method for polygenic prediction, LDpred-funct, that leverages trait-specific functional priors to increase prediction accuracy. We fit priors using the recently developed baseline-LD model, which includes coding, conserved, regulatory and LD-related annotations. We analytically estimate posterior mean causal effect sizes and then use cross-validation to regularize these estimates, improving prediction accuracy for sparse architectures. LDpred-funct attained higher prediction accuracy than other polygenic prediction methods in simulations using real genotypes. We applied LDpred-funct to predict 21 highly heritable traits in the UK Biobank. We used association statistics from British-ancestry samples as training data (avg N=373K) and samples of other European ancestries as validation data (avg N=22K), to minimize confounding. LDpred-funct attained a +4.6% relative improvement in average prediction accuracy (avg prediction R2=0.144; highest R2=0.413 for height) compared to SBayesR (the best method that does not incorporate functional information). For height, meta-analyzing training data from UK Biobank and 23andMe cohorts (total N=1107K; higher heritability in UK Biobank cohort) increased prediction R2 to 0.431. Our results show that incorporating functional priors improves polygenic prediction accuracy, consistent with the functional architecture of complex traits.",

    "abstract": "It has been proposed that hierarchical prediction is a fundamental computational principle underlying neurocognitive processing. Here we ask whether the brain engages distinct neurocognitive mechanisms in response to inputs that fulfill versus violate strong predictions at different levels of representation during language comprehension. Participants read three-sentence scenarios in which the third sentence constrained for a broad event structure, e.g. {Agent caution animate-Patient}. High constraint contexts additionally constrained for a specific event/lexical item, e.g. a two-sentence context about a beach, lifeguards and sharks constrained for the event, {Lifeguards cautioned Swimmers} and the specific lexical item, \\\"swimmers\\\". Low constraint contexts did not constrain for any specific event/lexical item. We measured ERPs on critical nouns that fulfilled and/or violated each of these constraints. We found clear, dissociable effects to fulfilled semantic predictions (a reduced N400), to event/lexical prediction violations (an increased late frontal positivity), and to event structure/animacy prediction violations (an increased late posterior positivity/P600). We argue that the late frontal positivity reflects a large change in activity associated with successfully updating the comprehenders current situation model with new unpredicted information. We suggest that the late posterior positivity/P600 is triggered when the comprehender detects a conflict between the input and her model of the communicator and communicative environment. This leads to an initial failure to incorporate new unpredicted input, which may be followed by second-pass attempts to make sense of the discourse through reanalysis, repair, or reinterpretation. Together, these findings provide strong evidence that confirmed and violated predictions at different levels of representation manifest as distinct spatiotemporal neural signatures.",

    "abstract": "A key challenge in modeling single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data is to capture the diverse gene expression states regulated by different transcriptional regulatory inputs across single cells, which is further complicated by a large number of observed zero and low expressions. We developed a left truncated mixture Gaussian (LTMG) model that stems from the kinetic relationships between the transcriptional regulatory inputs and metabolism of mRNA and gene expression abundance in a cell. LTMG infers the expression multi-modalities across single cell entities, representing a genes diverse expression states; meanwhile the dropouts and low expressions are treated as left truncated, specifically representing an expression state that is under suppression. We demonstrated that LTMG has significantly better goodness of fitting on an extensive number of single-cell data sets, comparing to three other state of the art models. In addition, our systems kinetic approach of handling the low and zero expressions and correctness of the identified multimodality are validated on several independent experimental data sets. Application on data of complex tissues demonstrated the capability of LTMG in extracting varied expression states specific to cell types or cell functions. Based on LTMG, a differential gene expression test and a co-regulation module identification method, namely LTMG-DGE and LTMG-GCR, are further developed. We experimentally validated that LTMG-DGE is equipped with higher sensitivity and specificity in detecting differentially expressed genes, compared with other five popular methods, and that LTMG-GCR is capable to retrieve the gene co-regulation modules corresponding to perturbed transcriptional regulations.

    "abstract": "A fundamental organizing principle in the somatosensory and motor systems is somatotopy, where specific body parts are represented separately and adjacently to other body parts, resulting in a body map. Different terminals of the sensorimotor network show varied somatotopic layouts, in which the relative position, distance and overlap between body-part representations differ. Since somatotopy is best characterized in the primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortices, these terminals have been the main focus of research on somatotopic remapping following loss of sensory input (e.g. arm amputation). Cortical remapping is generally considered to be driven by the layout of the underlying somatotopy, such that neighboring body-part representations tend to activate the deprived brain region. Here, we challenge the assumption that somatotopic layout restricts remapping, by comparing patterns of remapping in humans born without one hand (hereafter, one-handers, n=26) across multiple terminals of the sensorimotor pathway. We first report that in the cerebellum of one-handers, the deprived hand region represents multiple body parts. Importantly, the representations of some of these body parts do not neighbor the deprived hand region. We further replicate our previous finding, showing a similar pattern of remapping in the deprived hand region of the cerebral cortex in one-handers. Finally, we report preliminary results of a similar remapping pattern in the putamen of one-handers. Since these three sensorimotor terminals (cerebellum, cerebrum, putamen) contain different somatotopic layouts, the parallel remapping they undergo demonstrates that the mere spatial layout of body-part representations may not exclusively dictate remapping in the sensorimotor systems.\\n\\nSignificance StatementWhen a hand is missing, the brain region that typically processes information from that hand may instead process information from other body-parts, a phenomenon termed remapping. It is commonly thought that only body-parts whose information is processed in regions neighboring the hand region could \\\"take up\\\" the resources of this now deprived region. Here we demonstrate that information from multiple body-parts is processed in the hand regions of both the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. The native brain regions of these body-parts have varying levels of overlap with the hand region across multiple terminals in the sensorimotor hierarchy, and do not necessarily neighbor the hand region. We therefore propose that proximity between brain regions does not limit brain remapping.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDisentangling the selective factors shaping adaptive trait variation is an important but challenging task. Many studies--especially in Drosophila--have documented trait variation along latitudinal or altitudinal clines, but frequently lack resolution about specific environmental gradients that could be causal selective agents, and often do not investigate covariation between traits simultaneously. Here we examined variation in multiple macroecological factors across geographic space and their associations with variation in three physiological traits (desiccation resistance, UV resistance, and pigmentation) at both population and species scales, to address the role of abiotic environment in shaping trait variation.\\n\\nResultsUsing environmental data from collection locations of three North American Drosophila species--D. americana americana, D. americana texana and D. novamexicana--we identified two primary axes of macroecological variation; these differentiated species habitats and were strongly loaded for precipitation and moisture variables. In nine focal populations (three per species) assayed for each trait, we detected significant species-level variation for both desiccation resistance and pigmentation, but not for UV resistance. Species-level trait variation was consistent with differential natural selection imposed by variation in habitat water availability, although patterns of variation differed between desiccation resistance and pigmentation, and we found little evidence for pleiotropy between traits.\\n\\nConclusionsOur multi-faceted approach enabled us to identify potential agents of natural selection and examine how they might influence the evolution of multiple traits at different evolutionary scales. Our findings highlight that environmental factors influence functional trait variation in ways that can be complex, and point to the importance of studies that examine these relationships at both population- and species-levels.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundColombia was the second most affected country during the American Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic, with over 109,000 reported cases. Despite the scale of the outbreak, limited genomic sequence data were available from Colombia. We sought to sequence additional samples and use genomic epidemiology to describe ZIKV dynamics in Colombia.\\n\\nMethodsWe sequenced ZIKV genomes directly from clinical diagnostic specimens and infected Aedes ae-gypti samples selected to cover the temporal and geographic breadth of the Colombian outbreak. We performed phylogeographic analysis of these genomes, along with other publicly-available ZIKV genomes from the Americas, to estimate the frequency and timing of ZIKV introductions to Colombia.\\n\\nResultsWe attempted PCR amplification on 184 samples; 19 samples amplified sufficiently to perform sequencing. Of these, 8 samples yielded sequences with at least 50% coverage. Our phylogeo-graphic reconstruction indicates two separate introductions of ZIKV to Colombia, one of which was previously unrecognized. We find that ZIKV was first introduced to Colombia in February 2015 (95%CI: Jan 2015 - Apr 2015), corresponding to 5 to 8 months of cryptic ZIKV transmission prior to confirmation in September 2015. Despite the presence of multiple introductions, we find that the majority of Colombian ZIKV diversity descends from a single introduction. We find evidence for movement of ZIKV from Colombia into bordering countries, including Peru, Ecuador, Panama, and Venezuela.\\n\\nConclusionsSimilarly to genomic epidemiologic studies of ZIKV dynamics in other countries, we find that ZIKV circulated cryptically in Colombia. This more accurate dating of when ZIKV was circulating refines our definition of the population at risk. Additionally, our finding that the majority of ZIKV transmission within Colombia was attributable to transmission between individuals, rather than repeated travel-related importations, indicates that improved detection and control might have succeeded in limiting the scale of the outbreak within Colombia.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological surveillance for important wildlife diseases often relies on samples obtained from hunter-harvested animals. A problem, however, is that although convenient and cost-effective, hunter-harvest samples are not representative of the population due to heterogeneities in disease distribution and biased sampling. We developed an agent-based modeling framework that i) simulates a deer population in a user-generated landscape, and ii) uses a snapshot of the in silico deer population to simulate disease prevalence and distribution, harvest effort and sampling as per user-specified parameters. This framework can incorporate real-world heterogeneities in disease distribution, hunter harvest and harvest-based sampling, and therefore can be useful in informing wildlife disease surveillance strategies, specifically to determine population-specific sample sizes necessary for prompt detection of disease. Application of this framework is illustrated using the example of chronic wasting disease (CWD) surveillance in Missouris white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) population. We show how confidence in detecting CWD is grossly overestimated under the unrealistic, but standard, assumptions that sampling effort and disease are randomly and independently distributed. We then provide adjusted sample size recommendations based on more realistic assumptions. These models can be readily adapted to other regions as well as other wildlife disease systems.",

    "abstract": "Sequence analyses of RNA virus genomes remain challenging due to the exceptional genetic plasticity of these viruses. Because of high mutation and recombination rates, genome replication by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases leads to populations of closely related viruses, so-called  quasispecies. Standard (short-read) sequencing technologies are ill-suited to reconstruct large numbers of full-length haplotypes of (i) RNA virus genomes and (ii) subgenome-length (sg) RNAs comprised of noncontiguous genome regions. Here, we used a full-length, direct RNA sequencing (DRS) approach based on nanopores to characterize viral RNAs produced in cells infected with a human coronavirus.\\n\\nUsing DRS, we were able to map the longest ([~]26 kb) contiguous read to the viral reference genome. By combining Illumina and nanopore sequencing, we reconstructed a highly accurate consensus sequence of the human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E genome (27.3 kb). Furthermore, using long reads that did not require an assembly step, we were able to identify, in infected cells, diverse and novel HCoV-229E sg RNAs that remain to be characterized. Also, the DRS approach, which circumvents reverse transcription and amplification of RNA, allowed us to detect methylation sites in viral RNAs. Our work paves the way for haplotype-based analyses of viral quasispecies by demonstrating the feasibility of intra-sample haplotype separation.\\n\\nEven though several technical challenges remain to be addressed to exploit the potential of the nanopore technology fully, our work illustrates that direct RNA sequencing may significantly advance genomic studies of complex virus populations, including predictions on long-range interactions in individual full-length viral RNA haplotypes.",

    "abstract": "When dealing with multiple tasks, we often find ourselves in the problem of establishing the order in which to tackle them. Here we asked whether confidence, the subjective feeling in the accuracy of our decisions, plays an active role in this ordering problem. In a series of experiments, we show that confidence acts as a priority signal when ordering responses about tasks already completed, or ordering tasks that are to be made. In experiments 1-3, participants were engaged in a dual task and categorized perceptual stimuli along two dimensions. We found that they tended to give first the decision in which they were more confident. We also prove that confidence drives prioritization above and beyond task difficulty or response accuracy, and we discard alternative interpretations in terms of response availability or task demands. In experiments 4-6, we show that when participants have to select which of two sets of trials they want to perform first, they engage first in the set associated with higher confidence, and we extend this finding to situations involving non-perceptual (mental calculation) decisions. Our results thus support the role of confidence as a priority signal, thereby demonstrating a new way in which it regulates human behavior.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIWe show that when having to decide the order in which to approach two tasks, humans prefer to start with the one they feel more confident in.\\nC_LIO_LIThis holds both when deciding in which order to report two already completed tasks, and when deciding the order in which to tackle two tasks yet to complete.

    "abstract": "Antibiotics are the major tool for treating bacterial infections. With rising antibiotic resistance in microbes, strategies that limit further evolution and spread of drug resistance are urgently needed, in individuals and populations. While classical recommendations favor longer and aggressive treatments, more recent studies and clinical trials advocate for moderate regimens. In this debate, two axes of aggressive treatment have typically been conflated: treatment intensity and treatment duration, the latter being rarely addressed by mathematical models. Here, by using a simple mathematical model of a generic bacterial infection, controlled by hosts immune response, we investigate the role of treatment timing and antibiotic efficacy in determining optimal duration of treatment. We show that even in such simple mathematical model, it is impossible to select for universally optimal treatment duration. In particular, short (3 day) or long (7 day) treatments may be both beneficial depending on treatment onset, on the criterion used, and on the antibiotic efficacy. This results from the dynamic trade-off between immunity and resistance in acute, self-limiting infections, and uncertainty relating symptoms to the start of infection. We find that treatment timing can shift the trend between resistance selection and length of antibiotic exposure in individual hosts. We propose that major advances in predicting impact of antibiotics on bacterial infections must come from deeper experimental understanding of bacterial infection dynamics in humans. To guide rational therapy, mathematical models need to be constrained by data, including details of pathology and symptom thresholds in patients, and of host immune control of infection.",

    "abstract": "The growth and evolutionary expansion of the cerebral cortex are defined by the spatial-temporal production of neurons, which itself depends on the decision of radial glial cells (RGCs) to self-amplify or to switch to neurogenic divisions. The mechanisms regulating these RGC fate decisions are still incompletely understood. Here we describe a novel and evolutionarily conserved role of the canonical BMP transcription factors SMAD1/5 in controlling neurogenesis and growth during corticogenesis. Reducing the expression of both SMAD1 and SMAD5 in neural progenitors at early mouse cortical development caused microcephaly and an increased production of early-born cortical neurons at the expense of late-born ones, which correlated with the premature differentiation and depletion of the pool of cortical progenitors. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments performed during early cortical neurogenesis in the chick revealed that SMAD1/5 activity supports self-amplifying RGC divisions and restrain the neurogenic ones. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SMAD1/5 stimulate RGC self-amplification through the positive post-transcriptional regulation of the Hippo signaling effector YAP. We anticipate this SMAD1/5-YAP signaling module to be fundamental in controlling growth and evolution of the amniote cerebral cortex.",

Our results reveal a send-receive cortical hierarchy that recapitulates established organizational gradients differentiating sensory-motor and multimodal areas. We find that send-receive asymmetries are significantly associated with the directionality of effective connectivity derived from spectral dynamic causal modeling. Finally, using fruit fly, mouse and macaque connectomes, we provide further evidence suggesting that directionality of neural signalling is significantly encoded in the undirected architecture of nervous systems.",

We propose the concept of send-receive communication asymmetry to characterize cortical regions as senders, receivers or neutral, based on differences between their incoming and outgoing communication efficiencies. Our results reveal a send-receive cortical hierarchy that recapitulates established organizational gradients differentiating sensory-motor and multimodal areas. We find that send-receive asymmetries are significantly associated with the directionality of effective connectivity derived from spectral dynamic causal modeling. Finally, using fruit fly, mouse and macaque connectomes, we provide further evidence suggesting that directionality of neural signalling is significantly encoded in the undirected architecture of nervous systems.",

    "abstract": "Metabarcoding is often presented as an alternative identification tool to compensate for coarse taxonomic resolution and misidentification encountered with traditional morphological approaches. However, metabarcoding comes with two major impediments which slow down its adoption. First, the picking and destruction of organisms for DNA extraction are time and cost consuming and do not allow organism conservation for further evaluations. Second, current metabarcoding protocols include a PCR enrichment step which induces errors in the estimation of species diversity and relative biomasses. In this study, we first evaluated the capacity of capture enrichment to replace PCR enrichment using controlled freshwater macrozoobenthos mock communities. Then, we tested if DNA extracted from the fixative ethanol (etDNA) of the same mock communities can be used as an alternative to DNA extracted from pools of whole organisms (bulk DNA). We show that capture enrichment provides more reliable and accurate representation of species occurrences and relative biomasses in comparison with PCR enrichment for bulk DNA. While etDNA does not permit to estimate relative biomasses, etDNA and bulk DNA provide equivalent species detection rates. Thanks to its robustness to mismatches, capture enrichment is already an efficient alternative to PCR enrichment for metabarcoding and, if coupled to etDNA, is a time-saver option in studies where presence information only is sufficient.",

However, a detrimental side-effect of low emigration is the increase in competition among related individuals. The evolution of altruism depends on the balance between these opposite effects. This balance is already known to be affected by details of the life cycle; we show here that it further depends on the fidelity of strategy transmission from parents to their offspring. We consider different life cycles and identify thresholds of parent-offspring strategy transmission inaccuracy, above which higher emigration can increase the frequency of altruists maintained in the population. Predictions were first obtained analytically assuming weak selection and equal deme sizes, then confirmed with stochastic simulations relaxing these assumptions. Contrary to what happens with perfect strategy transmission from parent to off-spring, our results show that higher emigration can be favorable to the evolution of altruism.",

    "abstract": "When incipient species meet in secondary contact, natural selection can rapidly reduce costly reproductive interactions by directly targeting reproductive traits. This process, called reproductive character displacement (RCD), leaves a characteristic pattern of geographic variation where divergence of traits between species is greater in sympatry than allopatry. However, because other forces can also cause similar patterns, care must be given in separating pattern from process. Here we show how the phylo-comparative method together with genomic data can be used to evaluate evolutionary processes at the population level in closely related species. Using this framework, we test the role of RCD in speciation of two cricket species endemic to Anatolian mountains by quantifying patterns of character displacement, rates of evolution and adaptive divergence. Our results show differing patterns of character displacement between species for reproductive vs. non-reproductive characters and strong patterns of asymmetric divergence. We demonstrate diversification results from rapid divergence of reproductive traits towards multiple optima under the dual influence of strong drift and selection. These results present the first solid evidence for RCD in Anatolian mountains, quantify the amount of drift and selection necessary for RCD to lead to speciation, and demonstrate the utility of phylo-comparative methods for quantifying evolutionary parameters at the population level.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic models of the evolution of protein-coding sequences can provide insights into the selection pressures that have shaped them. In the application of these models synonymous nucleotide substitutions, which do not alter the encoded amino acid, are often assumed to have limited functional consequences and used as a proxy for the neutral rate of evolution. The ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates is then used to categorize the selective regime that applies to the protein (e.g. purifying selection, neutral evolution, diversifying selection). Here, we extend these models to explore the extent of purifying selection acting on substitutions between synonymous stop codons. Using a large collection of coding sequence alignments we estimate that a high proportion (approximately 57%) of mammalian genes are affected by selection acting on stop codon preference. This proportion varies substantially by codon, with UGA stop codons far more likely to be conserved. Genes with evidence of selection acting on synonymous stop codons have distinctive characteristics, compared to unconserved genes with the same stop codon, including enrichment for specific functional properties. Notably, genes with conserved stop codons have longer 3 UTRs and are associated with shorter mRNA half-life than other genes. The coding regions of these genes are also much more likely to be under strong purifying selection pressure. Our results suggest that the preference for UGA stop codons found in many multicellular eukaryotes is selective rather than mutational in origin.",

Many aspects of the transcriptional regulation of LPA are poorly understood and the role of epigenetics has not been addressed yet. Therefore, we conducted an epigenome-wide analysis of DNA methylation on Lp(a) levels in two population-based studies (total n=2208). We identified a CpG site in the LPA promoter which was significantly associated with Lp(a) concentrations. Surprisingly, the identified CpG site was found to overlap the SNP rs76735376. We genotyped this SNP de-novo in three studies (total n=7512). The minor allele of rs76735376 (1.1% minor allele frequency) was associated with increased Lp(a) values (p=1.01e-59) and explained 3.5% of the variation of Lp(a). Statistical mediation analysis showed that the effect on Lp(a) is rather originating from the base change itself and is not mediated by DNA methylation levels. This finding is supported by eQTL data from 153 liver tissue samples from the GTEx project, which shows a significant association of the rs76735376 minor allele with increased LPA expression. In summary, our data supports a functional role of rs76735376 in the regulation of LPA expression.",

Transforming growth factor-{beta} was used as a trigger for fibrosis. Here, we have reproduced the classic hallmarks of fibrosis-induced heart failure including high collagen deposition, increased tissue stiffness, BNP secretion, and passive tension. Force of contraction was significantly decreased in fibrotic tissues that displayed a transcriptomic signature consistent with human cardiac fibrosis/heart failure. Treatment with an anti-fibrotic drug decreased tissue stiffness and BNP secretion, with corresponding changes in the transcriptomic signature. This model represents an accessible approach to study human heart failure in vitro, and allows for testing anti-fibrotic drugs while facilitating the real-time assessment of cardiomyocyte function.",

    "abstract": "Urbanization is currently a global phenomenon that has become the most important form of landscape change and is increasingly affecting biodiversity and ecosystem functions. In order to evaluate the impacts of urbanization and inform urban planning, it is important to understand the spatiotemporal patterns of land use change associated to urbanization. This paper exploits three different frameworks, namely landscape metrics, urban growth modes and fractal analysis to characterize the spatiotemporal patterns of urbanization of the Swiss urban agglomerations of Zurich, Bern and Lausanne. The land use inventory provided by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office was used to assemble four temporal snapshots from 1980 to 2016 at the extent of the urban agglomerations. The time series of landscape metrics generally supports the diffusion and coalescence model of urban growth, with Zurich exhibiting most characteristics of coalescence while Bern and Lausanne seem to be at the transition between diffusion and coalescence. Nevertheless, the analysis of the urban growth modes suggest that leapfrog development occurs at all periods, which contributes to an increasing fragmentation of natural patches and maintains the fractal configuration of the landscape. The discussion reviews potential explanations for the observed landscape changes, and concludes with some planning implications.",

    "abstract": "While environmentally inducible epigenetic marks are discussed as one mechanism of transgenerational plasticity, environmentally stable epigenetic marks emerge randomly. When resulting in variable phenotypes, stable marks can be targets of natural selection analogous to DNA sequence-based adaptation processes. We studied both postulated pathways in natural populations of three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and sequenced their methylomes and genomes across a salinity cline. Consistent with local adaptation, populations showed differential methylation (pop-DMS) at genes enriched for osmoregulatory processes. In a two-generation experiment, 62% of these pop-DMS were insensitive to salinity manipulation, suggesting that they could be stable targets for natural selection. Two-thirds of the remaining inducible pop-DMS became more similar to patterns detected in wild populations from the corresponding salinity, and this pattern accentuated over consecutive generations, indicating a mechanism of adaptive transgenerational plasticity. Natural DNA methylation patterns can thus be attributed to two epigenetic pathways underlying the rapid emergence of adaptive phenotypes in the face of environmental change.",

Tropomodulin 2 (Tmod2) is an actin-regulating gene that plays an important role in synapse maturation and dendritic arborization and has been implicated in substance-abuse and intellectual disability in humans. Here we mine the KOMP2 data and find that Tmod2 knockout mice show emotionality phenotypes that are predictive of addiction vulnerability. Detailed addiction phenotyping showed that Tmod2 deletion does not affect the acute locomotor response to cocaine administration. However, sensitized locomotor responses are highly attenuated in these knockouts, indicating perturbed drug-induced plasticity. In addition, Tmod2 mutant animals do not self-administer cocaine indicating lack of hedonic responses to cocaine. Whole brain MR imaging shows differences in brain volume across multiple regions although transcriptomic experiments did not reveal perturbations in gene co-expression networks. Detailed electrophysiological characterization of Tmod2 KO neurons, showed increased spontaneous firing rate of early postnatal and adult cortical and striatal neurons. Cocaine-induced synaptic plasticity that is critical for sensitization is either missing or reciprocal in Tmod2 KO nucleus accumbens shell medium spiny neurons, providing a mechanistic explanation of the cocaine response phenotypes.

Unlike Type II cells, individual BR cells are broadly tuned and respond to multiple stimuli across different taste modalities.

    "abstract": "The prospect of utilizing CRISPR-based gene-drive technology for controlling populations, such as invasive and disease-vector species, has generated much excitement. However, the potential for spillovers of gene drive alleles from the target population to non-target populations -- events that may be ecologically catastrophic -- has raised concerns. Here, using two-population mathematical models, we investigate the possibility of limiting spillovers and impact on non-target populations by designing differential-targeting gene drives, in which the expected equilibrium gene drive allele frequencies are high in the target population but low in the non-target population. We find that achieving differential targeting is possible with certain configurations of gene drive parameters. Most of these configurations ensure differential targeting only under relatively low migration rates between target and non-target populations. Under high migration, differential targeting is possible only in a narrow region of the parameter space. When migration is increased, differential-targeting states can sharply transition to states of global fixation or global loss of the gene drive. Because fixation of the gene drive in the non-target population could severely disrupt ecosystems, we outline possible ways to avoid this outcome. Our results emphasize that, although gene drive technology is promising, understanding the potential consequences for populations other than the targets requires detailed analysis of gene-drive spillovers, and that ways to limit the unintended effects of gene drives to non-target populations should be explored prior to the application of gene drives in natural settings.",

We found that specific configurations of CORnet-S best predicted fMRI responses in early visual cortex, and CORnet-R and SqueezeNet models best predicted fMRI responses in inferior temporal cortex. We found specific configurations of VGG-16 and CORnet-S models that best predicted the MEG responses.\\n\\nWe also observed that downsizing input images to ~50-75% of the input tensor size lead to better performing models compared to no downsizing (the default choice in most brain models for vision). Taken together, we present evidence that brain predictivity is sensitive not only to which ANN architecture and layer is used, but choices in image preprocessing and feature postprocessing, and these choices should be further explored.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how organisms adapt to extreme environments is fundamental and can provide insightful case studies for both evolutionary biology and climate-change biology. Here, we take advantage of the vast diversity of lifestyles in ants to identify genomic signatures of adaptation to extreme habitats such as high altitude. We hypothesised two parallel patterns would occur in a genome adapting to an extreme habitat: i) strong positive selection on genes related to adaptation and, ii) a relaxation of previous purifying selection. We tested this hypothesis by sequencing the high-elevation specialist Tetramorium alpestre and four other phylogenetic related species. In support of our hypothesis, we recorded a strong shift of selective forces in T. alpestre, in particular a stronger magnitude of diversifying and relaxed selection when compared to all other ants. We further disentangled candidate molecular adaptations in both gene expression and protein-coding sequence that were identified by our genome-wide analyses. In particular, we demonstrate that T. alpestre has i) a derived level of expression for stv and other heat-shock proteins in chill shock tests, and ii) enzymatic enhancement of Hex-T1, a rate-limiting regulatory enzyme that controls the entry of glucose into the glycolytic pathway. Together, our analyses highlight the adaptive molecular changes that support colonisation of high-altitude environments.",

    "abstract": "We developed a glaucoma-on-a-chip (GOC) model to evaluate the viability of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) against high pressure and the potential effect of neuroprotection. A three-layered chip consisting of interconnecting microchannels and culture wells was designed based on simulation of physical parameters. The chip layers were fabricated from poly-methyl methacrylate sheets. Multiple inlet ports allow culture media and gas into the wells under elevated hydrostatic pressure (EHP). The bottom surface of the wells was modified by air plasma and coated with different membranes to model an extracellular microenvironment. The SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line served as model cells to determine the best supporting membrane which was revealed to be PDL/laminin. Thereafter, the study experiments were performed using RGCs obtained from postnatal 5-7 Wistar rats purified by magnetic assisted cell sorting. Flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry assays demonstrated 70% purification for RGCs. The cultured RGCs were exposed to normal (15 mmHg) or elevated pressure (33 mmHg) for 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours, with and without adding brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or a novel BDNF mimetic (RNYK). RGC survival rates were 85, 78, 70, 67 and 61 percent under normal pressure versus 40, 22, 18, 12 and 10 percent under high pressure at 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours, respectively (P <0.0001). BDNF and RNYK treatments induced separately an approximate two-fold decrease in the rate of RGC death under both normal and elevated pressures (p <0.01 to 0.0001). This GOC model recapitulated the effects of elevated pressure during relatively short time periods and demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of BDNF and RNYK.",

    "abstract": "Two simplifying hypotheses have been proposed for whole-plant respiration. One links respiration to photosynthesis; the other to biomass. Using a first-principles carbon balance model with a prescribed live woody biomass turnover, applied at a forest research site where multidecadal measurements are available for comparison, we show that if turnover is fast the accumulation of respiring biomass is low and respiration depends primarily on photosynthesis; while if turnover is slow the accumulation of respiring biomass is high and respiration depends primarily on biomass. But the first scenario is inconsistent with evidence for substantial carryover of fixed carbon between years, while the second implies far too great an increase in respiration during stand development - leading to depleted carbohydrate reserves and an unrealistically high mortality risk. These two mutually incompatible hypotheses are thus both incorrect. Respiration is not linearly related either to photosynthesis or to biomass, but it is more strongly controlled by recent photosynthates (and reserve availability) than by total biomass.",

    "abstract": "Learning in sensorimotor adaptation tasks has been viewed as an implicit learning phenomenon. The implicit process affords recalibration of existing motor skills so that the system can adjust to changes in the body or environment without relearning from scratch. However, recent findings suggest that the implicit process is heavily constrained, calling into question its utility in motor learning and the theoretical framework of sensorimotor adaptation paradigms. These inferences have been based mainly on results from single bouts of training, where explicit compensation strategies, such as explicitly re-aiming the intended movement direction, contribute a significant proportion of adaptive learning. It is possible, however, that the implicit process supersedes explicit compensation strategies over repeated practice sessions. We tested this by dissociating the contributions of explicit re-aiming strategies and the implicit process over five consecutive days of training. Despite a substantially longer duration of training, the implicit process still plateaued at a value far short of complete learning and, as has been observed in previous studies, was inappropriate for a mirror reversal task. Notably, we find significant between subject differences that call into question traditional interpretation of these group-level results.\n\nSignificance StatementIn this set of studies, we find that the implicit process cannot fully account for learning in adaptation tasks, such as the visuomotor rotation and mirror reversal tasks, even following several days of training. In fact, the implicit process can be counterproductive to learning. Most notably, we find significant between subject differences that call into question traditional interpretation of these group-level results.",

    "abstract": "Fine fescues (Festuca L., Poaceae) are turfgrass species that perform well in low-input environments. Based on morphological characteristics, the most commonly-utilized fine fescues are divided into five taxa: three are subspecies within F. rubra L. and the remaining two are treated as species within the F. ovina L. complex. Morphologically, these five taxa are very similar, both identification and classification of fine fescues remain challenging. In an effort to develop identification methods for fescues, we used flow cytometry to estimate genome size, ploidy level, and sequenced the chloroplast genome of all five taxa. Fine fescue chloroplast genome sizes ranged from 133,331 to 133,841 bp and contained 113 to 114 genes. Phylogenetic relationship reconstruction using whole chloroplast genome sequences agreed with previous work based on morphology. Comparative genomics suggested unique repeat signatures for each fine fescue taxon that could potentially be used for marker development for taxon identification.",

    "abstract": "Cornichon homolog-3 (CNIH3) is an AMPA receptor (AMPAR) auxiliary protein that traffics AMPARs to the postsynaptic membrane and potentiates AMPAR signaling. AMPARs are key components of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory formation, however the role of CNIH3 in memory has yet to be elucidated. To study the role of CNIH3 on mouse behavior, we bred and characterized a line of Cnih3-/- mice from C57BL/6 Cnih3tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi mice obtained from the Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP). In agreement with previous studies of CNIH3 in the brain, we observed concentrated expression of Cnih3 in the dorsal hippocampus, a region associated with spatial learning and memory. Therefore, we tested Cnih3+/+, Cnih3+/-, and Cnih3-/- mice in the Barnes maze paradigm to measure spatial memory. We observed no change in spatial memory in male Cnih3+/- and Cnih3-/- mice compared to male Cnih3+/+ controls, however, Cnih3-/- female mice made significantly more primary errors, had a higher primary latency, and took less efficient routes to the target in the maze compared to Cnih3+/+ female mice. Next, to investigate an enhancement of spatial memory by Cnih3 overexpression, specifically in the dorsal hippocampus, we developed an AAV5 viral construct to express wild-type Cnih3 in excitatory neurons. Female mice overexpressing Cnih3 made significantly fewer errors, had a lower primary latency to the target, and took more efficient routes to the maze target compared to YFP expressing control females. No change in spatial memory was observed in male Cnih3 overexpression mice. This study, the first to identify sex-specific effects of the AMPAR auxiliary protein CNIH3 on spatial memory, provides the groundwork for future studies investigating the role of CNIH3 on sexually dimorphic AMPAR-dependent behavior and hippocampal synaptic plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Wheat productivity is severely reduced by high temperatures. Breeding of heat tolerant cultivars can be achieved by identifying genes controlling physiological and agronomical traits with high temperature and using these to select superior genotypes, but no gene underlying genetic variation for heat tolerance has previously been described. We completed the positional cloning of qYDH.3BL, a quantitative trait locus (QTL) on bread wheat chromosome 3B associated with increased yield in hot and dry climates. The delimited genomic region contained 12 putative genes and a sequence variant in the promoter region of one gene - seven in absentia, TaSINA. This was associated with the QTLs effects on early vigour, plant biomass and yield components in two distinct wheat populations grown under various growth conditions. Near isogenic lines carrying the positive allele at qYDH.3BL under-expressed TaSINA and had increased vigour and water use efficiency early in development, as well as increased biomass, grain number and grain weight following heat stress. A survey of worldwide distribution indicated that the positive allele became widespread from the 1950s through the CIMMYT wheat breeding programme but, to date, has been selected only in breeding programmes in Mexico and Australia.\\n\\nSignificance statementWheat is the worlds most widely grown crop and a staple of human diet. Even brief episodes of high temperature in the growing season cause severe yield reductions. Finding and deploying genes for heat stress tolerance in new varieties is a priority for food security with climate change. We narrowed a genetic locus to a small genomic region where genetic variation was present only in one gene that showed clear differences of expression and improved yield and physiology under stress in the populations. Using diagnostic markers to track the positive haplotype in nearly 750 accessions, we found many regions where the allele could be used in breeding programmes to increase wheats heat tolerance.",

Here we exploit a genetic zebrafish model of tauopathy, combined with live microglia imaging, to investigate the behaviour of microglia in vivo in the disease context. Results show that while microglia were almost immobile and displayed long and highly dynamic branches in a wild-type context, in presence of diseased neurons cells became highly mobile and displayed morphological changes, with highly mobile cell bodies together with fewer and shorter processes. We also imaged, for the first time to our knowledge, the phagocytosis of apoptotic tauopathic neurons by microglia in vivo and observed that microglia engulfed about as twice materials as in controls. Finally, genetic ablation of microglia in zebrafish tauopathy model significantly increased Tau hyperphosphorylation, suggesting that microglia provide neuroprotection to diseased neurons. Our findings demonstrate for the first time the dynamics of microglia in contact with tauopathic neurons in vivo and open perspectives for the real-time study of microglia in many neuronal diseases.",

HIOC (50 mg/kg) or TUDCA (500mg/kg) were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected into adult C57BL/6 mice three times per week. Two weeks after treatment (6 injections), unilateral optic nerve crush was conducted followed by treatment at the same day. The treatment was continued until 1 week or 2 weeks after ONC. A control cohort was identically treated with drug vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline; PBS). Retinas were harvested for whole mount immunofluorescence staining with RGC markers and imaged by fluorescent confocal microscopy at 40x magnification. Fluorescing cells were counted by computer-assisted automated identification and counting software (CellProfiler). Cohort sampling sizes were N=4 and statistical tesing was by the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Test. Significant loss (80%85%) occurred in the PBS-injected group 1 and 2 weeks after ONC. This loss was partially but significantly prevented in drug-treated cohorts (P < 0.05). Delivery of HIOC or TUDCA by i.p. injection increased survival of RGCs after ONC. Protection was similar between treatment with either drug. These data suggest that it is worthwhile to further explore possible protective effects of HIOC or TUDCA on RGC subtypes with regards to structure and function and in additional disease models that involve RGC loss.",

Here we show that signal-activated nanoclustering of membrane proteins and a cytoskeleton-based feedback loop provide an important mechanism for the establishment of cell polarity. The phytohormone auxin promoted sterol-dependent nanoclustering of cell surface transmembrane receptor-like kinase 1 (TMK1) to initiate cell polarity during the morphogenesis of Arabidopsis puzzle piece-shaped leaf pavement cells (PC). Auxin-triggered nanoclustering of TMK1 stabilized flotillin-associated ordered nanodomains, which were essential for auxin-mediated formation of ROP6 GTPase nanoclusters that act downstream TMK1 to promote cortical microtubule ordering. Mathematical modeling further demonstrated the essential role of this auxin-mediated stabilization of TMK1 and ROP6 nanoclusters, and predicted the additional requirement of ROP6-dependent cortical microtubules for further stabilization of TMK1-sterol nanodomains and the polarization of PC. This prediction was experimentally validated by genetic and biochemical data.

    "abstract": "Cell polarity is fundamental to the development of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms, yet the mechanism of its establishment remains poorly understood. Here we show that signal-activated nanoclustering of membrane proteins and a cytoskeleton-based feedback loop provide an important mechanism for the establishment of cell polarity. The phytohormone auxin promoted sterol-dependent nanoclustering of cell surface transmembrane receptor-like kinase 1 (TMK1) to initiate cell polarity during the morphogenesis of Arabidopsis puzzle piece-shaped leaf pavement cells (PC). Auxin-triggered nanoclustering of TMK1 stabilized flotillin-associated ordered nanodomains, which were essential for auxin-mediated formation of ROP6 GTPase nanoclusters that act downstream TMK1 to promote cortical microtubule ordering. Mathematical modeling further demonstrated the essential role of this auxin-mediated stabilization of TMK1 and ROP6 nanoclusters, and predicted the additional requirement of ROP6-dependent cortical microtubules for further stabilization of TMK1-sterol nanodomains and the polarization of PC. This prediction was experimentally validated by genetic and biochemical data. Our studies reveal a new paradigm for polarity establishment: A diffusive signal triggers cell polarization by activating cell surface receptor-mediated lateral segregation of signaling components and a cytoskeleton-mediated positive feedback loop of nanodomain stabilization.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LISterols are required for cell polarity in Arabidopsis leaf epidermal cells\\nC_LIO_LIAuxin promotes lipid ordering and polar distribution of ordered lipid nanodomains at the plasma membrane (PM)\\nC_LIO_LIAuxin stabilizes sterol-dependent nanoclustering of transmembrane kinase (TMK1), a PM auxin signal transducer\\nC_LIO_LIAuxin-induced TMK1 nanoclustering is required but insufficient for cell polarization\\nC_LIO_LIMicrotubule-based feedback stabilization of the auxin-induced TMK1 nanodomains can generate cell polarity\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "During the 1960s, small quantities of radioactive materials were co-disposed with chemical waste at the Little Forest Legacy Site (LFLS, Sydney, Australia). The microbial function and population dynamics in a waste trench during a rainfall event have been previously investigated using shotgun metagenomics. This revealed a broad abundance of candidate and potentially undescribed taxa in this iron-rich, radionuclide-contaminated environment.\n\nHere, applying genome-based metagenomic methods, we recovered 37 refined archaeal MAGs ([&ge;]50% completeness, [&le;]10% redundancy) from 10 different major lineages. They were, mainly, included in four DPANN lineages without standing nomenclature (LFWA-I to IV) and Methanoperedenaceae (ANME-2D).\n\nWhile most of the new DPANN lineages show reduced genomes with limited central metabolism typical of other DPANN, the orders under the LFWA-III lineage,  Ca. Gugararchaeales and  Ca. Anstonellales, may constitute distinct orders with a more comprehensive central metabolism and anabolic capabilities within the Micrarchaeota phylum.\n\nThe new Methanoperedens spp. MAGs, together with previously published data, suggests metal ions as the ancestral electron acceptors during the anaerobic oxidation of methane while the respiration of nitrate/nitrite via molybdopterin oxidoreductases would have been a secondary acquisition. The presence of genes for the biosynthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoates in most Methanoperedens also appears to be a widespread characteristic of the genus for carbon accumulation.\n\nWe formally propose 22 new candidate taxa based on data analysed in this manuscript, as well as four missing formal taxa definitions and two new candidate species based on extant data. We present evidence of four new DPANN lineages and six non-conspecific Methanoperedens, while exploring their uniqueness, potential role in elemental cycling, and evolutionary history.",

Here, we report a robust, versatile approach named CRISPR Live-cell fluorescent in situ hybridization (LiveFISH) for multi-locus genome tracking and cytogenetic detection in a broad variety of cell types including primary cells. LiveFISH utilizes an intrinsic stability switch of CRISPR guide RNAs, which enables efficient and accurate detection of chromosomal disorders such as Patau Syndrome in prenatal amniotic fluid cells and allows multi-locus tracking in human T lymphocytes. Using LiveFISH, we are able to detect and track real-time spatiotemporal dynamics of non-homologous endogenous chromosome translocations induced by gene editing. This new approach enables FISH imaging in living primary cells, which can provide useful insights into the spatiotemporal changes of genome organization and rearrangements in normal and diseased primary cells and will enable fast cytogenetic visualization of various gene-editing associated chromosomal translocations.",

    "abstract": "Engineered living materials have the potential for wide-ranging applications such as biosensing and treatment of diseases. Programmable cells provide the functional basis for living materials, however, their release into the environment raises numerous biosafety concerns. Current designs that limit the release of genetically engineered cells typically involve the fabrication of multi-layer hybrid materials with sub-micron porous matrices. Nevertheless the stringent physical barriers limit the diffusion of macromolecules and therefore the repertoire of molecules available for actuation in response to communication signals between cells and their environment. Here, we engineer a first-of-its-kind living material entitled  Platform for Adhesin-mediated Trapping of Cells in Hydrogels (PATCH). This technology is based on engineered E. coli that displays an adhesion protein derived from an Antarctic bacterium with high affinity for glucose. The adhesin stably anchors E. coli in dextran-based hydrogels with large pore diameters (10-100 m) and reduces the leakage of bacteria into the environment by up to 100-fold. As an application of PATCH, we engineered E. coli to secrete lysostaphin via the Type 1 Secretion System and demonstrated that living materials containing this E. coli inhibit the growth of S. aureus, including the strain resistant to methicillin (MRSA). Our tunable platform allows stable integration of programmable cells in dextran-based hydrogels without compromising free diffusion of macromolecules and could have potential applications in biotechnology and biomedicine.",

Recurring heat pulses may disrupt functions supported by soil microorganisms, thus affecting the entire ecosystem. However, most perturbation experiments only test effects of single heat events, and therefore it remains largely unknown how soil microorganisms react to repeated pulse events. Here we present data from a lab experiment exposing 32 filamentous fungi, originally isolated from the same soil, to sequential heat perturbations. Soil saprobic fungi isolates were exposed to one or two heat pulses: mild (35{degrees}C/2h), strong (45{degrees}C/1h), or both in sequence (35{degrees}C/2h+45{degrees}C/1h), and we assessed growth rate. Out of the 32 isolates 13 isolates showed an antagonistic response, 3 isolates a synergistic response and 16 isolates responded in an additive manner. These differences in species responses to the thermal environment may contribute to species coexistence, and such dissimilarities in thermal perturbation responses may be a key aspect influencing ecosystem services that soil saprobic fungi support.",

This allows one-time learning to take place through strengthening entire patterns of activation at one go. We present a model that accepts a salience signal, and returns a reverse salience signal. We demonstrate that we can tag an image with salience with only a single training iteration, and that the same image will then produces the highest reverse salience signal during classification. We explore the effects of salience on learning via its effect on the activation functions of each node, as well as on the strength of weights in the network. We demonstrate that a salience signal improves classification accuracy of the specific image that was tagged with salience, as well as all images in the same class, while penalizing images in other classes. Results are validated using 5-fold validation testing on MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets. This research serves as a proof of concept, and could be the first step towards introducing salience tagging into Deep Learning Networks and robotics.",

Kssd is more accurate and faster for resemblance estimation than other sketching methods developed so far. Notably, kssd is robust even when two sequences are of very different sizes. For containment analysis, kssd slightly outperformed mash screen--its closest competitor--in accuracy, while took testing datasets of 110,535 times less space occupation and consumed 2,523 times less CPU time than mash screen--suggesting kssd is suite for quick containment analysis for almost the entire omics datasets deposited in NCBI.

    "abstract": "Epithelial cell polarity defects support cancer progression. It is thus crucial to decipher the functional interactions within the polarity protein network. Here we show that Drosophila Girdin and its human ortholog (GIRDIN) sustain the function of crucial lateral polarity proteins by inhibiting the apical kinase aPKC. Loss of GIRDIN expression is also associated with overgrowth of disorganized cell cysts. Moreover, we observed cell dissemination from GIRDIN knockdown cysts and tumorspheres, thereby showing that GIRDIN supports the cohesion of multicellular epithelial structures. Consistent with these observations, alteration of GIRDIN expression is associated with a poor overall survival in subtypes of breast and lung cancers. Overall, we discovered a core mechanism contributing to epithelial cell polarization from flies to humans. Our data also indicate that GIRDIN has the potential to impair the progression of epithelial cancers by preserving cell polarity and restricting cell dissemination.",

Recently, the discovery of cholesterol recognition amino acid consensus (CRAC) on proteins indicated a putative direct, non-covalent interaction between cholesterol and proteins. In the present study, we evaluated the presence of a CRAC motif and its inverted version (CARC) in the transmembrane region (TMR) of the tyrosine kinase receptor family (RTK) in several species using in silico methods. CRAC motifs were found across all species analyzed, while CARC was found only in vertebrates. The tropomyosin-related kinase B (TRKB), a member of the RTK family, is a core participant in the neuronal plasticity process and exhibits a CARC motif in its TMR. Upon recognition of the conserved CARC motif in the TRKB, we performed molecular dynamics simulations with the mouse TRKB TMR sequence, which indicated that cholesterol interaction with the TRKB CARC motif occurs mainly at the central Y433 residue. Binding assay suggested a bell-shaped effect of cholesterol on BDNF interaction with TRKB receptors. Therefore, CARC/CRAC motifs may have a role in the function of the RTK family TMR.",

    "abstract": "Multi-environment trials (METs) are widely used to assess the performance of promising crop germplasm. Though seldom designed to elucidate genetic mechanisms, MET datasets are often much larger than could be duplicated for genetic research and, given proper interpretation, may offer valuable insights into the genetics of adaptation across time and space. The Cooperative Dry Bean Nursery (CDBN) is a MET for common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) grown for over 70 years in the United States and Canada, consisting of 20 to 50 entries each year at 10 to 20 locations. The CBDN provides a rich source of phenotypic data across entries, years, and locations that is amenable to genetic analysis. To study stable genetic effects segregating in this MET, we conducted genome-wide association (GWAS) using best linear unbiased predictions (BLUPs) derived across years and locations for 21 CDBN phenotypes and genotypic data (1.2M SNPs) for 327 CDBN genotypes. The value of this approach was confirmed by the discovery of three candidate genes and genomic regions previously identified in balanced GWAS. Multivariate adaptive shrinkage (mash) analysis, which increased our power to detect significant correlated effects, found significant effects for all phenotypes. The first use of mash on an agricultural dataset discovered two genomic regions with pleiotropic effects on multiple phenotypes, likely selected on in pursuit of a crop ideotype. Overall, our results demonstrate that by applying multiple statistical genomic approaches on data mined from MET phenotypic data sets, significant genetic effects that define genomic regions associated with crop improvement can be discovered.",

    "abstract": "While microbiome studies have focused on diversity on the species or higher level, bacterial species in microbiomes are represented by different, often multiple strains. These strains could be clonally and phenotypically very different, making assessment of strain content vital to a full understanding of microbiome function. This is especially important with respect to antibiotic resistant strains, the clonal spread of which may be dependent on competition between them and susceptible strains from the same species. The pandemic, multi-drug resistant, and highly pathogenic E. coli subclone ST131-H30 (H30) is of special interest, as it has already been found persisting in the gut and bladder of healthy people. In order to rapidly assess E. coli clonal diversity, we developed a novel method based on deep sequencing of two loci used for sequence typing, along with an algorithm for analysis of resulting data. Using this method, we assessed fecal and urinary samples from healthy women carrying H30, and were able to uncover considerable diversity, including strains with frequencies at <1% of the E. coli population. We also found that even in the absence of antibiotic use, H30 could complete dominate the gut and, especially, urine of healthy carriers. Our study offers a novel tool for assessing a species clonal diversity (clonobiome) within the microbiome, that could be useful in studying population structure and dynamics of multi-drug resistant and/or highly pathogenic strains in their natural environments.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEBacterial species in the microbiome are often represented by multiple genetically and phenotypically different strains, making insight into subspecies diversity critical to a full understanding of the microbiome, especially with respect to opportunistic pathogens. However, methods allowing efficient high-throughput clonal typing are not currently available. This study combines a conventional E. coli typing method with deep amplicon sequencing to allow analysis of many samples concurrently. While our method was developed for E. coli, it may be adapted for other species, allowing for microbiome researchers to assess clonal strain diversity in natural samples. Since assessment of subspecies diversity is particularly important for understanding the spread of antibiotic resistance, we applied our method to study of a pandemic multidrug-resistant E. coli clone. The results we present suggest that this clone could be highly competitive in healthy carriers, and that the mechanisms of colonization by such clones need to be studied.",

    "abstract": "The human M5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) has recently emerged as an exciting therapeutic target for treating a range of disorders, including drug addiction. However, a lack of structural information for this receptor subtype has limited further drug development and validation. Here we report a high-resolution crystal structure of the human M5 mAChR bound to the clinically used inverse agonist, tiotropium. This structure allowed for a comparison across all five mAChR family members that revealed important differences in both orthosteric and allosteric sites that could inform the rational design of selective ligands. These structural studies together with chimeric swaps between the extracellular regions of the M2 and M5 mAChR further revealed the structural insight into \\\"kinetic-selectivity\\\", where ligands show differential residency times between related family members. Collectively, our study provides important insights into the nature of orthosteric and allosteric ligand interaction across the mAChR family that could be exploited for the design of selective ligands.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe five subtypes of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) are expressed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system where they play a vital role in physiology and pathologies. Recently, the M5 mAChR subtype has emerged as an exciting drug target for the treatment of drug addiction. We have determined the atomic structure of the M5 mAChR bound to the clinically used inverse agonist tiotropium. The M5 mAChR structure now allows for a full comparison of all five mAChR subtypes and reveals subtle differences in the extracellular loop (ECL) regions of the receptor that mediate orthosteric and allosteric ligand selectivity. Together these findings open the door for future structure-based design of selective drugs that target this therapeutically important class of receptors.",

Although cytokinin receptors are substantially localised to the endoplasmic reticulum 3-5, the cellular sites of cytokinin perception continue to be debated 1,6,7. Several cytokinin types display bioactivity 8,9 and recently a cell-specific cytokinin gradient was reported in roots 10. Yet, the importance of spatially heterogeneous cytokinin distribution and the specific cytokinin(s) that account for the different responses remain unclear. Here we show that cytokinin perception by plasma membrane receptors is an effective path for cytokinin response in root cells. Readout from a Two Component Signalling cytokinin-specific reporter (TCSn::GFP;11) is closely matched to intracellular cytokinin content, yet a proportion of bioactive cytokinins are detected in the extracellular fluid. Using cytokinins covalently linked to beads that could not pass the plasma membrane, we demonstrate that strong TCSn activation still occurs and that this response is greatly diminished in cytokinin receptor mutants. Although intracellular receptors play significant roles, we argue for a revision of concepts of cytokinin perception to include the spatial dimensions. In particular, selective ligand-receptor affinities, cellular localisation and tissue distribution of bioactive cytokinins, their receptors, transporters and inactivation enzymes appear all to be components of the signalling regulatory mechanisms.",

However, there is a lack of reliable methods for statistical inference of differentially responding lineages. Here, we used mixtures of DNA-barcoded cell pools to generate a realistic benchmark read count dataset for modelling a range of outcomes of lineage-tracing experiments. By accounting for the statistical properties intrinsic to the DNA barcode read count data, we implemented an improved algorithm that provides a significantly higher accuracy at detecting differentially responding lineages, compared to current RNA-seq data analysis algorithms. Building on the reliable statistical methodology, we illustrate how multidimensional phenotypic profiling (or high-throughput  lineage phenomics) enables one to deconvolute phenotypically distinct cell subpopulations within a cancer cell line.

    "abstract": "When the same phenotype evolves repeatedly, we can explore the predictability of genetic changes underlying phenotypic evolution. Theory suggests that genetic parallelism is less likely when phenotypic changes are governed by many small-effect loci compared to few of major effect, because different combinations of genetic changes can result in the same quantitative outcome. However, some genetic trajectories might be favored over others, making a shared genetic basis to repeated polygenic evolution more likely. To examine this, we studied the genetics of parallel male mating song evolution in the Hawaiian cricket Laupala. We compared quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying song divergence in three species pairs varying in phenotypic distance. We tested whether replicated song divergence between species involves the same QTL and the likelihood that sharing QTL is related to phenotypic effect sizes. Contrary to theoretical predictions, we find substantial parallelism in polygenic genetic architectures underlying repeated song divergence. QTL overlapped more than expected based on simulated QTL analyses. Interestingly, QTL effect size did not predict QTL sharing, but did correlate with magnitude of phenotypic divergence. We highlight potential mechanisms driving these constraints on cricket song evolution and discuss a scenario that consolidates empirical quantitative genetic observations with micro-mutational theory.",

    "abstract": "We model natural selection for or against an anti-parasite (or anti-predator) defense allele in a host (or prey) population that is structured into many demes. The defense behavior has a fitness cost for the actor compared to non defenders (\"cheaters\") in the same deme and locally reduces parasite growth rates. Hutzenthaler et al. (2022) have analytically derived a criterion for fixation or extinction of defenders in the limit of large populations, many demes, weak selection and slow migration. Here, we use both individual-based and diffusion-based simulation approaches to analyze related models. We find that the criterion still leads to accurate predictions for settings with finitely many demes and with various migration patterns.\n\nA key mechanism of providing a benefit of the defense trait is genetic drift due to randomness of reproduction and death events leading to between-deme differences in defense allele frequencies and host population sizes. We discuss an inclusive-fitness interpretation of this mechanism and present in-silico evidence that under these conditions a defense trait can be altruistic and still spread in a structured population.",

    "abstract": "Type VI secretion system (T6SS) is an effector delivery system used by gram-negative bacteria to kill other bacteria or eukaryotic host to gain fitness. In Agrobacterium tumefaciens, T6SS has been shown to kill other bacteria such as Escherichia coli. Interestingly, the A. tumefaciens T6SS killing efficiency differs when using different E. coli strains as recipient cells. Thus, we hypothesize that a successful T6SS killing not only relies on attacker T6SS activity but also depends on recipient factors. A high-throughput interbacterial competition assay was employed to test the hypothesis by screening for mutants with reduced killing outcomes caused by A. tumefaciens strain C58. From the 3909 E. coli Keio mutants screened, 16 candidate mutants were filtered out. One strain, {Delta}clpP::Kan, showed ten times more resistant to T6SS-mediating killing but restored its susceptibility when complemented with clpP in trans. ClpP is a universal and highly conserved protease that exists in both prokaryotes and eukaryotic organelles. In E. coli, ClpP uses either ClpA or ClpX as an adaptor for substrate specificity. Therefore, the susceptibility of the {Delta}clpA::Kan and {Delta}clpX::Kan was also tested. The T6SS attack susceptibility of {Delta}clpA::Kan is at the same level as {Delta}clpP::Kan, while {Delta}clpX::Kan showed no difference as compared to that of wild-type E. coli BW25113. The data also suggest that ClpA-ClpP interaction, rather than its protease activity, is responsible for enhancing susceptibility to T6SS killing. This study highlights the importance of recipient factors in determining the outcome of T6SS killing.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic-resistant infections are predicted to kill 10 million people worldwide per year by 2050 and to cost the global economy 100 trillion USD. Novel approaches and alternatives to conventional antibiotics are urgently required to combat antimicrobial resistance. We have synthesized a chitosan-based oligolysine antimicrobial peptide, CSM5-K5, which targets multidrug resistant (MDR) bacterial species. Here we show that CSM5-K5 exhibits rapid bactericidal activity against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), MDR Escherichia coli, and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE). Combinatorial therapy of CSM5-K5 with antibiotics to which each organism is otherwise resistant restores sensitivity to the conventional antibiotic. CSM5-K5 alone significantly reduced pre-formed bacterial biofilm by two-four orders of magnitude and, in combination with traditional antibiotics, reduced pre-formed biofilm by more than two-three orders of magnitude at sub inhibitory concentrations. Moreover, using a mouse excisional wound infection model, CSM5-K5 treatment reduced bacterial burdens by one to three orders of magnitude, and acted synergistically with vancomycin and tetracycline to clear VRE and MDR E. coli, respectively. Importantly, little to no resistance against CSM5-K5 arose for any of the three MDR bacteria during 15 days of serial passage. This work demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of using this synthetic cationic peptide as alternative to, or in combination with, traditional antibiotics to treat infections caused by MDR bacteria.",

Here we describe a molecular switch involving a highly conserved anion binding site in CK1. This switch controls conformation of the activation loop to define substrate selectivity on mammalian PER2, thereby directly regulating its stability. Integrated experimental and computational studies shed light on the allosteric linkage between two anion binding sites that dynamically regulate kinase activity. We show that period-altering kinase mutations from humans to Drosophila differentially modulate this activation loop switch to elicit predictable changes in PER2 stability, providing a foundation to understand and further manipulate CK1 regulation of circadian rhythms.",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneity in disease transmission is widespread and, when not accounted for, can produce unpredictable outbreaks of infectious disease. Despite this, precisely how different sources of variation in host traits drive heterogeneity in disease transmission is poorly understood. Here we dissected the sources of variation in pathogen transmission using Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila C Virus as a host-pathogen model system. We found that infected lifespan, viral growth, virus shedding, and viral load at death were all significantly influenced by fly genetic background, sex and female mating status. To understand how variation in each of these traits may generate heterogeneity in disease transmission, we estimated individual transmission potential by integrating data on virus shedding and lifespan alongside previously collected data on social aggregation. We found that [~]15% of between-individual heterogeneity in disease transmission was explained by a significant interaction between genetic and sex-specific variation. We also characterised the amount of variation in viral load, virus shedding, and lifespan following infection that could be explained by genetic background and sex. Amongst the determinants of individual variation in disease transmission these sources of host variation play roles of varying importance, with genetic background generally playing the largest role. Our results highlight the importance of characterising sources of variation in multiple host traits when studying disease transmission at the individual-level.",

In this study, we determined the bacterial diversity profile of the Mexico City subway by massive sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. We identified a total of 50,197 operative taxonomic units (OTUs) and 1058 genera. The metro microbiome was dominated by the phylum Actinobacteria and by the genera Propionibacterium (15%) (P. acnes 13%), Corynebacterium (13%), Streptococcus (9%), and Staphylococcus (5%) (S. epidermidis; 4%), reflecting the microbe composition of normal human skin. The metro microbial sources were skin, dust, saliva, and vaginal, with no fecal contribution detected. A total of 420 bacterial genera were universal to the twelve metro lines tested, and they contributed to 99.10% of the abundance. The large OTUs number are probably reflecting the vast human influx, while selection from hosts and environments are constraining the genera diversity, shown by the OTUs to genus ratio. Finally, this study shows that the microbial composition of the Mexico City subway comes from a mixture of environmental and human sources and that commuters are exposed to normal human microbiota.",

There are two dominant explanations for orphan genes: complete sequence divergence from ancestral genes, such that homologues are not readily detectable; and de novo emergence from ancestral non-genic sequences, such that homologues genuinely do not exist. The relative contribution of the two processes remains unknown. Here, we harness the special circumstance of conserved synteny to estimate the contribution of complete divergence to the pool of orphan genes. By separately comparing yeast, fly and human genes to related taxa using conservative criteria, we find that complete divergence accounts, on average, for at most a third of eukaryotic orphan and taxonomically restricted genes. We observe that complete divergence occurs at a stable rate within a phylum but at different rates between phyla, and is frequently associated with gene shortening akin to pseudogenization. Two cancer-related human genes, DEC1 and DIRC1, have likely originated via this route in a primate ancestor.",

    "abstract": "Talin, vinculin, and paxillin are mechanosensitive proteins that are recruited early to integrin-based nascent adhesions (NAs). Using machine learning, traction microscopy, single-particle-tracking, and fluorescence fluctuation analysis, we find that talin, vinculin, and paxillin are recruited in near-synchrony to NAs maturing to focal adhesions. After initial recruitment of all three proteins under minimal load, vinculin accumulates in these NAs at a ~5 fold higher rate than in non-maturing NAs and with faster growth in traction. We identify a domain in talin, R8, which exposes a vinculin-binding-site (VBS) without requiring load. Stabilizing this domain via mutation lowers load-free vinculin binding to talin, impairs maturation of NAs, and reduces the rate of additional vinculin recruitment. Taken together, our data show that talins concurrent localization with vinculin, before engagement with integrins, is essential for NA maturation, which entails traction-mediated unfolding of talin and exposure of additional VBSs triggering further vinculin binding.",

    "abstract": "Polyploidy or whole genome duplications (WGDs) repeatedly occurred during green plant evolution. To examine the evolutionary history of green plants in a phylogenomic framework, the 1KP project sequenced over 1000 transcriptomes across the Viridiplantae. The 1KP project provided a unique opportunity to study the distribution and occurrence of WGDs across the green plants. In the 1KP capstone analyses, we used a total evidence approach that combined inferences of WGDs from Ks and phylogenomic methods to infer and place ancient WGDs. Overall, 244 putative ancient WGDs were inferred across the Viridiplantae. Here, we describe these analyses and evaluate the consistency of the WGD inferences by comparing them to evidence from published syntenic analyses of plant genome assemblies. We find that our inferences are consistent with whole genome synteny analyses and our total evidence approach may minimize the false positive rate throughout the data set. Given these resources will be useful for many future analyses on gene and genome evolution in green plants, we release 383,679 nuclear gene family phylogenies and 2,306 gene age distribution (Ks) plots from the 1KP capstone paper.",

    "abstract": "The genome of Staphylococcus aureus has eight structurally distinct cation/proton antiporters (CPA) that play significant roles in maintaining cytoplasmic pH and ions in extreme conditions. These antiporters enable S. aureus to persist under conditions that are favorable to the bacterium but unfavorable to animal host including humans. In this study, we report physiological roles and catalytic properties of NhaC (NhaC1, NhaC2 and NhaC3), CPA1 (CPA1-1 and CPA1-2) and CPA2 family antiporters and how these antiporters crosstalk with Mnh1, a CPA3 family antiporter, recently shown to play important roles in virulence and pH tolerance. Catalytic properties of antiporters were determined by Na+/H+ and K+/H+ antiport assays using everted membrane vesicles of a CPA-deficient E. coli KNabC host. NhaC and CPA1 candidates exhibited Na+/H+ and K+/H+ antiporter activity in the pH range between pH 7 to 9.5 but did not show significant role in halotolerance and osmotolerance alone. Interestingly, NhaC3 exhibited significant antiporter activity at alkaline pH and play major roles in pH and salt tolerance. CPA2 neither exhibited Na+or K+/H+ exchange nor showed any active role in pH and salt tolerance. Double deletion of mnhA1 with nhaC1, nhaC3, cpa1-1 or cpa1-2 respectively, made S. aureus severely sensitive at pH 7.5 under stress conditions indicating synergistic relationship of Mnh1 with these antiporters. The functional loss study of these antiporters in in-vivo mouse infection model, nhaC3 deletion showed significant loss of S. aureus virulence. Altogether, the current study indicates NhaC3 as a potential target against S. aureus virulence under extreme pH and salt conditions.\\n\\nImportanceIn this study, we established catalytic properties and physiological roles of S. aureus NhaC, CPA1 and CPA2 family antiporters and their importance under salt and alkaline stress conditions. Except CPA2, all five antiporters of both families were active for Na+/H+ and K+/H+ exchange. CPA1-1 showed significant role in pH homeostasis at pH 7.5 whereas CPA1-2 and NhaCs were major contributors to halotolerance and osmotolerance at alkaline pH. The severity of growth deficit in double knockouts of mnhA1 with each of nhaC1, nhaC2, nhaC3, cpa1-1 or cpa1-2 establishes their synergistic relationship in regulating pH and salt homeostasis. Deletion of cpa1-1, cpa1-2 and nhaC1, nhaC2, and nhaC3 were assessed in mice model and NhaC3 was shown to play a major role in S. aureus virulence.",

We developed an alternative method for hydrogen production using iron filings and acetic acid with the aim of cultivating methanogens more efficiently and more quickly (chemical method). We developed this new method with a reference strain of Methanobrevibacter oralis, compared the method to the biological reference method with a reference strain of Methanobrevibacter smithii and finally applied the method to 50 saliva samples. Methanogen colonies counted using ImageJ software were identified using epifluorescence optical microscopy, real-time PCR and PCR sequencing. For cultures containing the pure strains of M. oralis and M. smithii, colonies appeared three days postinoculation with the chemical method versus nine days with the biological method. The average number of M. smithii colonies was significantly higher with the chemical method than with the biological method. There was no difference in the delay of observation of the first colonies in the saliva samples between the two methods. However, the average number of colonies was significantly higher when using the biological method than when using the chemical method at six days and nine days postinoculation (Students test, p = 0.005 and p = 0.04, respectively). The chemical method made it possible to isolate four strains of M. oralis and three strains of M. smithii from the 50 saliva samples.

The results showed TaGS1;1, the dominant TaGS1 isozyme, had a high affinity for substrates, and was widely localized in the mesophyll cells, root pericycle and root tip meristematic zone, suggesting it was the primary isozyme for N assimilation. TaGS1;2, with a high affinity for Glu, was activated by Gln, and was mainly localized in the around vascular tissues, indicating that TaGS1;2 catalyzed Gln synthesis in low Glu concentration, then the Gln returned to activate TaGS1;2, which may lead to the rapid accumulation of Gln around the vascular tissues. TaGS1;3 had low affinity for substrates but the highest Vmax among TaGS1, was mainly localized in the root tip meristematic zone; exogenous NH4+ could promote TaGS1;3 expressing, indicating that TaGS1;3 could rapidly assimilate NH4+ to relieve NH4+ toxicity. In conclusion, TaGS1;1, TaGS1;2 and TaGS1;3 have different role in N assimilation, Gln translocation and relieving ammonium toxicity, respectively, and synergistically perform nitrogen assimilation and translocation.\\n\\nHighlightThree cytosolic glutamine synthase isozymes of wheat have different role and synergistically perform nitrogen assimilation and translocation.",

The primary neutral lipids are triacylglycerols and steryl esters. It is not known whether other classes of neutral lipids can form lipid droplets by themselves. Here we show that production of retinyl esters by lecithin:retinol acyl transferase (LRAT) in yeast cells, incapable of producing triacylglycerols and steryl esters, causes the formation of lipid droplets. By electron microscopy, these lipid droplets are morphologically indistinguishable from those in wild-type cells. In silico and in vitro experiments confirmed the propensity of retinyl esters to segregate from membranes and to form lipid droplets. The hydrophobic N-terminus of LRAT displays preferential interactions with retinyl esters in membranes and promotes the formation of large retinyl ester-containing lipid droplets in mammalian cells. Our combined data indicate that the molecular design of LRAT is optimally suited to allow the formation of characteristic large lipid droplets in retinyl ester-storing cells.",

The accuracy of sensing is ultimately limited by the finite number of ligand molecules bound by receptors. Previously derived physical limits to sensing accuracy have assumed that the concentration was constant and ignored its temporal fluctuations. We formulate the problem of concentration sensing in a strongly fluctuating environment as a non-linear field-theoretic problem, for which we find an excellent approximate Gaussian solution. We derive a new physical bound on the relative error in concentration c which scales as{delta} c/c ~ (Dac{tau})-1/4 with ligand diffusivity D, receptor cross-section a, and characteristic fluctuation time scale{tau} , in stark contrast with the usual Berg and Purcell bound{delta} c/c ~ (DacT)-1/2 for a perfect receptor sensing concentration during time T. We show how the bound can be achieved by a simple biochemical network downstream the receptor that adapts the kinetics of signaling as a function of the square root of the sensed concentration.",

By exploiting the laminar-flow profile in microfluidics, 3D positions can be extracted from cells or other objects of interest by calibrating the depth-dependent response of the imaging system using fluorescent microspheres mixed with the sample buffer. We demonstrate this approach for measuring fluorescently-labeled DNA in vitro and the chromosomal compaction state in large populations of live cells, collecting thousands of samples each minute.

We induced subtle intracellular Zn2+ perturbations and tracked asynchronously cycling cells throughout division using fluorescent reporters, high throughput microscopy, and quantitative analysis. We found that Zn2+ deficiency induces quiescence and Zn2+ resupply stimulates cell-cycle reentry. By monitoring single cells after Zn2+ deprivation, we found that depending on where cells were in the cell cycle, they either went quiescent or entered the cell cycle but stalled in S phase. Stalled cells were defective in DNA synthesis and had increased DNA damage levels, suggesting a role for Zn2+ in maintaining genome integrity. Finally, we found that Zn2+ deficiency-induced quiescence does not require the cell-cycle inhibitor p21.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for a detailed analysis of ciliary orientation (CO). We used volume electron microscopy to examine CO relative to the tracheal long axis (TLA) by measuring the inter- and intracellular basal body orientation (BBO) and axonemal orientation (AO), which are considered to coincide, both equivalently indicating the effective stroke direction. Our results, however, reveal that only the mean BBO is aligned with the TLA, whereas the AO determines the effective stroke direction as well as the mucociliary transport direction. Furthermore, we show that even if the mean CO is conserved across cell boundaries, a considerable gradient in CO exists within individual cells, which we suspect to be crucial for the emergence of coordinated ciliary activity. Our findings provide new quantitative insight into CO and correlate this new structural information with mucociliary function.",

    "abstract": "Fungi are major components of the Earths biosphere [1], sustaining many critical ecosystem processes [2, 3]. Key to fungal prominence is their characteristic cell biology, our understanding of which has been principally based on  higher dikaryan hyphal and yeast forms [4-6]. The early-diverging Chytridiomycota (chytrids) are ecologically important [2, 7, 8] and a significant component of fungal diversity [9-11], yet their cell biology remains poorly understood. Unlike dikaryan hyphae, chytrids typically attach to substrates and feed osmotrophically via anucleate rhizoids [12]. The evolution of fungal hyphae appears to have occurred from lineages exhibiting rhizoidal growth [13] and it has been hypothesised that a rhizoid-like structure was the precursor to multicellular hyphae and mycelial feeding in fungi [14]. Here we show in a unicellular chytrid, Rhizoclosmatium globosum, that rhizoid development has equivalent features to dikaryan hyphae and is adaptive to resource availability. Rhizoid morphogenesis exhibits analogous properties with growth in hyphal forms, including tip production, branching and decreasing fractal geometry towards the growing edge, and is controlled by {beta}-glucan-dependent cell wall synthesis and actin polymerisation. Chytrid rhizoids from individual cells also demonstrate adaptive morphological plasticity in response to substrate availability, developing a searching phenotype when carbon starved and exhibiting spatial differentiation when interacting with particulate substrates. Our results show striking similarities between unicellular early-diverging and dikaryan fungi, providing insights into chytrid cell biology, ecological prevalence and fungal evolution. We demonstrate that the sophisticated cell biology and developmental plasticity previously considered characteristic of hyphal fungi are shared more widely across the Kingdom Fungi and therefore could be conserved from their most recent common ancestor.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety and mood disorders are often comorbid with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and are considered critical in the development, maintenance, and reinstatement of alcohol dependence and harmful alcohol-seeking behaviors. Because of this high comorbidity, it is necessary to determine shared and unique genetic factors driving heavy ethanol drinking and anxiety-related behaviors. We used a model of stress-induced escalation of drinking in ethanol dependent C57BL/6J mice to measure anxiety-like behaviors on the marble burying and novelty-suppressed feeding task (NSFT) during abstinence. In order to identify novel pharmacogenetic targets that may lead to more effective treatment, a targeted bioinformatics analysis was used to quantify the expression of K+ channel genes in the amygdala that covary with anxiety-related phenotypes in the well phenotyped and fully sequenced family of BXD strains. A pharmacological approach was used to validate the key bioinformatics finding in ethanol-dependent, stressed C57BL/6J mice during the NSFT. Amygdalar expression of Kcnn3 correlated significantly with just over 40 anxiety-associated phenotypes. Further examination of Kcnn3 expression revealed a strong eigentrait for anxiety-like behaviors in this family. Kcnn3 expression in the amygdala correlated negatively with binge-like and voluntary ethanol drinking. C57BL/6J mice treated with chronic intermittent ethanol exposure and repeated swim stress consumed more ethanol in their home cages and showed hypophagia on the NSFT during prolonged abstinence. Pharmacologically targeting KCNN3 protein with the KCa2 channel positive modulator 1-EBIO decreased ethanol drinking and reduced latency to approach food during the NSFT in ethanol-dependent, stressed mice. Collectively these validation studies provide central nervous system mechanistic links into to the covariance of stress, anxiety, and AUD in the BXD strains. Further this analytical approach is effective in defining targets for treating alcohol dependence and comorbid mood and anxiety disorders.",

    "abstract": "Along with sperm, in many taxa male ejaculates also contain a complex mixture of proteins, peptides and other substances found in seminal fluid. Once seminal fluid proteins (SFPs) are transferred to the mating partner, they play crucial roles in mediating post-mating sexual selection, since they can modulate the partners behavior and physiology in ways that influence the reproductive success of both partners. One way in which sperm donors can maximize their own reproductive success is by changing the partners (sperm recipients) postcopulatory behavior to prevent or delay re-mating, thereby decreasing the likelihood or intensity of sperm competition. We therefore adopted a quantitative genetic approach combining gene expression and behavioral data to identify candidates that could mediate such a response in the simultaneously hermaphroditic flatworm Macrostomum lignano. We identified two putative SFPs - Mlig-pro46 and Mlig-pro63 - that exhibit a negative genetic correlation between transcript expression and mating frequency. Importantly, however, in one of the two different group sizes, differing in their sperm competition level, in which we measured genetic correlations, these same two transcripts are also linked to a second post-mating behavior in M. lignano, namely the  suck behavior of recipients in which, upon ejaculate receipt, the worm places its pharynx over its female genital opening and appears to attempt to remove ejaculate components. To therefore investigate directly whether these two candidates manipulate partner behavior, and test whether this impacts on competitive fertilization success, we performed a manipulative experiment using RNA interference-induced knockdown to ask how loss of Mlig-pro46 and Mlig-pro63 expression, singly and in combination, affects mating frequency, partner suck propensity and both defensive and offensive sperm competitive ability (P1 and P2, respectively). None of the knock-down treatments impacted strongly on mating frequency or sperm competitive ability, but the knock-down of Mlig-pro63 resulted in a significantly decreased  suck propensity of mating partners. This suggests that Mlig-pro63 may normally act as a cue in the ejaculate to trigger recipient suck behavior, though the functional and adaptive significance of these two seminal proteins from a donor perspective remains enigmatic.",

    "abstract": "We previously showed that NUDT21-spanning copy-number variations (CNVs) are associated with intellectual disability (Gennarino et al., 2015). However, the patients CNVs also included other genes. To determine if reduced NUDT21 function alone can cause disease, we generated Nudt21+/- mice to mimic the human state of decreased expression. We found that although these mice have 50% reduced Nudt21 mRNA, they only have 30% less of its cognate protein, CFIm25. Despite this partial protein-level compensation, the Nudt21+/- mice have learning deficits and cortical hyperexcitability. Further, to determine the molecular mechanism driving neural dysfunction, we partially inhibited NUDT21 in human stem cell-derived neurons to reduce CFIm25 by 30%. This reduction in CFIm25 was sufficient to induce misregulated alternative polyadenylation (APA) and protein levels in hundreds of genes, dozens of which cause intellectual disability when mutated. Altogether, these results indicate that disruption of NUDT21-regulated APA events in the brain can cause intellectual disability.",

    "abstract": "Glaucoma and optic neuropathies cause progressive and irreversible degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and the optic nerve and are currently without any effective treatment. Previous research into cell replacement therapy of these neurodegenerative diseases has been stalled due to the limited capability for grafted RGCs to integrate into the retina and project properly along the long visual pathway to reach their brain targets. In vivo RGC regeneration would be a promising alternative approach but mammalian retinas lack regenerative capacity even though cold-blood vertebrates such as zebrafish have the full capacity to regenerate a damaged retina using Muller glia (MG) as retinal stem cells. Nevertheless, mammalian MG undergo limited neurogenesis when stimulated by retinal injury. Therefore, a fundamental question that remains to be answered is whether MG can be induced to efficiently regenerate functional RGCs for vision restoration in mammals. Here we show that without stimulating proliferation, the transcription factor (TF) Math5 together with a Brn3 TF family member are able to reprogram mature mouse MG into RGCs with exceedingly high efficiency while either alone has no or limited capacity. The reprogrammed RGCs extend long axons that make appropriate intra-retinal and extra-retinal projections through the entire visual pathway including the optic nerve, optic chiasm and optic tract to innervate both image-forming and non-image-forming brain targets. They exhibit typical neuronal electrophysiological properties and improve visual responses in two glaucoma mouse models: Brn3b null mutant mice and mice with the optic nerve crushed (ONC). Together, our data provide evidence that mammalian MG can be reprogrammed by defined TFs to achieve robust in vivo regeneration of functional RGCs as well as a promising new therapeutic approach to restore vision to patients with glaucoma and other optic neuropathies.",

The contextual factors that govern whether these estimations depend on model-free learning (tracking outcomes) vs. model-based learning (learning generative stimulus distributions) are poorly understood. We studied model-free and model-based learning using serial decision-making tasks in which subjects selected a rule and then used it to flexibly act on visual stimuli. A factorial approach defined a family of behavioral models that could integrate model-free and model-based strategies to predict rule selection trial-by-trial. Bayesian model selection demonstrated that the subjects strategies varied depending on lower-level task characteristics such as the identities of the rule options. In certain conditions, subjects integrated learned stimulus distributions and tracked reward rates to guide their behavior. The results thus identify tradeoffs between model-based and model-free decision strategies, and in some cases parallel utilization, depending on task context.",

In this study, we identified a population of Superior Colliculus (SC) neurons projecting to the VTA which increase their activity before conspecific interaction and control orienting response towards unfamiliar conspecifics.

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction includes heritable diseases, acquired pathologies, and age-related declines in health. Szeto-Schiller (SS) peptides comprise a class of amphipathic tetrapeptides that have demonstrated efficacy in treating a wide array of mitochondrial disorders, and are believed to target mitochondrial membranes due to their enrichment in the anionic phospholipid cardiolipin (CL). However, little is known regarding how SS peptides interact with or alter the physical properties of lipid bilayers. In this study, we have analyzed the interactions of the lead compound SS-31 (Elamipretide) with model and mitochondrial membranes using biophysical and computational approaches. Our results show that this polybasic peptide partitions into the membrane interfacial region with affinity and binding density that are directly related to surface charge. SS-31 binding does not destabilize lamellar bilayers even at the highest binding concentrations; however, it does cause saturable alterations in lipid packing. Most notably, SS-31 modulates the surface electrostatic properties of model and mitochondrial membranes, which could play a significant role in the mitoprotective properties of this compound. As a proof of concept, we show that SS-31 alters ion distribution at the membrane interface with implications for maintaining mitochondrial membranes subject to divalent cation (calcium) stress. Taken together, these results support a mechanism of action in which SS peptides interact with lipid bilayers and alter the biophysical (primarily electrostatic) properties of mitochondrial membranes as their primary mechanism of action. Understanding this molecular mechanism is key to the development of future compound variants with enhanced efficacy.\\n\\nSignificanceSzeto-Schiller (SS) peptides are among the most promising therapeutic compounds for mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the molecular target(s) and the mechanism of action of SS peptides are poorly understood. In this study, we evaluate the interaction of the lead compound SS-31 (Elamipretide) with mitochondrial and synthetic model membranes using a host of biophysical techniques. Our results show that SS-31 membrane interaction is driven largely by the negative surface charge of mitochondrial membranes and that SS-31 alters lipid bilayer properties, most notably electrostatics at the membrane interface. This work supports a mechanism in which SS peptides act on a key physical property of mitochondrial membranes rather than with a specific protein complex, consistent with the exceptionally broad therapeutic efficacy of these compounds.",

However, the mechanism of when and where these high-level expectations act on sensory processing is unclear. Here, we isolate the effect of expectation absent any auditory evoked activity by assessing the response to omitted expected sounds. Electrophysiological signals were recorded directly from the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and superior temporal sulcus (STS) in patients with medically refractory epilepsy. Subjects listened to a predictable sequence of syllables, with some infrequently omitted. We found a high frequency band (HFB, 70-150Hz) response to omissions, which overlap with a posterior subset of auditory active electrodes. This response is distinct from omission activations observed in non-auditory selective sites in STG. Heard syllables could be classified reliably from STG, but not the identity of the omitted stimulus. Both omission- and target detection activations were also observed in prefrontal cortex.\\n\\nWe propose that the posterior STG and STS are central for implementing predictions in the auditory environment.

Several tools have been developed to resolve this problem. However, they either only focus on removing contained duplicate regions, also known as haplotigs, or fail to use all the relevant information and hence make errors.\\n\\nResultsHere we present a novel tool \\\"purge_dups\\\" that uses sequence similarity and read depth to automatically identify and remove both haplotigs and heterozygous overlaps. In comparison with the current standard, purge_haplotigs, we demonstrate that purge_dups can reduce heterozygous duplication and increase assembly continuity while maintaining completeness of the primary assembly.

After one generation of exposure, we tested for changes in key morphological, behavioural and physiological traits related to migratory performance including wing dimorphism, flight capacity and positive phototaxis. Our results showed that all three morphological and behavioural phenotypes responded to a small difference in magnetic field intensity between the simulated northern vs. southern locations in ways expected along the migratory route. Consistent magnetic responses in the expression of the phototaxis-related Drosophila-like cryptochrome 1 (Cry1) gene and levels of two primary energy substrates used during flight, triglyceride and trehalose, were also found.

    "abstract": "Geomagnetic field (GMF) intensity can be used by some animals to determine their direction and position during migration. However, its role, if any, in mediating other migration-related phenotypes remains largely unknown. Here, we simulated variation in GMF intensity between two locations along the migration route of a nocturnal insect migrant, the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens, that varied by [~]5 T (GMF50T vs. GMF45T) in field intensity. After one generation of exposure, we tested for changes in key morphological, behavioural and physiological traits related to migratory performance including wing dimorphism, flight capacity and positive phototaxis. Our results showed that all three morphological and behavioural phenotypes responded to a small difference in magnetic field intensity between the simulated northern vs. southern locations in ways expected along the migratory route. Consistent magnetic responses in the expression of the phototaxis-related Drosophila-like cryptochrome 1 (Cry1) gene and levels of two primary energy substrates used during flight, triglyceride and trehalose, were also found. Our findings indicate GMF intensity can be a cue that regulates the expression of phenotypes critical for insect migration and highlight the unique role of magnetoreception as a trait that can help migratory insects express potentially beneficial phenotypes in geographically variable environments.",

    "abstract": "Cell death is a critical process that occurs normally in health and disease. However, its study is limited due to available technologies that only detect very late stages in the process or specific death mechanisms. Here, we report the development of a new fluorescent biosensor called genetically encoded death indicator (GEDI). GEDI specifically detects an intracellular Ca2+ level that cells achieve early in the cell death process and marks a stage at which cells are irreversibly committed to die. The time-resolved nature of GEDI delineates a binary demarcation of cell life and death in real time, reformulating the definition of cell death. We demonstrate that GEDI acutely and accurately reports death of rodent and human neurons in vitro, and show GEDI enables a novel automated imaging platform for single cell detection of neuronal death in vivo in zebrafish larvae. With a quantitative pseudo-ratiometric signal, GEDI facilitates high-throughput analysis of cell death in time lapse imaging analysis, providing the necessary resolution and scale to identify early factors leading to cell death in studies of neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive disturbance as a consequence of the loss of cholinergic neurons in the brain, neuritic plaques and hyperphosphorylation of TAU protein. Although the underlying mechanisms leading to these events are unclear, mutations in presenilin 1 (PSEN1), e.g., E280A (PSEN1 E280A), are causative factors for autosomal dominant early-onset familial AD (FAD). Despite advances in the understanding of the physiopathology of AD, there are no efficient therapies to date. Limitations in culturing brain-derived live neurons might explain the limited effectiveness of AD research. Here, we show that mesenchymal stromal (stem) cells (MSCs) can be used to model FAD, providing novel opportunities to study cellular mechanisms and to establish therapeutic strategies. Indeed, we cultured MSCs with the FAD mutation PSEN1 E280A and wild-type (WT) PSEN1 from umbilical cords and characterized the transdifferentiation of these cells into cholinergic-like neurons (ChLNs). PSEN1 E280A ChLNs but not WT PSEN1 ChLNs exhibited increased intra- and extracellular A{beta}42 peptide and TAU phosphorylation (at residues Ser202/Thr205), recapitulating the molecular pathogenesis of FAD caused by mutant PSEN1. Furthermore, PSEN1 E280A ChLNs presented oxidative stress (OS) as evidenced by the oxidation of DJ-1Cys106-SH into DJ-1Cys106-SO3 and the detection of DCF-positive cells and apoptosis markers such as activated pro-apoptosis proteins p53, c-JUN, PUMA and CASPASE-3 and the concomitant loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential and DNA fragmentation. Additionally, mutant ChLNs displayed Ca2+ flux dysregulation and deficient acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity compared to control ChLNs. Interestingly, the inhibitor JNK SP600125 almost completely blocked TAU phosphorylation. Our findings demonstrate that FAD MSC-derived cholinergic neurons with the PSEN1 E280A mutation are a valid model of AD and provide important clues for the identification of targetable pathological molecules.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAnimal models of brain recovery identify the first days after lesioning as a time of great flux in sensorimotor function and physiology; these findings have implications for human stroke recovery. After rodent motor system lesioning, daily skill training in the less affected forelimb reduces skill acquisition in the more affected forelimb. We asked whether spontaneous human motor behaviors of the less affected upper extremity (UE) early after stroke resemble the animal training model, with the potential to suppress clinical recovery.\\n\\nMethodsThis prospective observational study used a convenience sample of patients <7 days after stroke (n=25) with a wide severity range; Controls were hospitalized for non-neurological conditions (n=12). Outcome measures were Accelerometry, Upper-Extremity Fugl-Meyer (UEFM), Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), Shoulder Abduction/ Finger Extension Test (SAFE), NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS).\\n\\nResultsAccelerometry indicated total paretic UE movement was reduced compared to controls, primarily due to a 44% reduction of bilateral UE use. Unilateral paretic movement was unchanged. Movement shifted to unilateral use of the nonparetic UE, which increased by 77%. Low correlations between movement time and motor performance prompted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) revealing a 2-component solution; motor performance tests load on one component (motor performance) whereas accelerometry-derived variables load on a second non-orthogonal component (quantity of movement).\\n\\nConclusionsEarly after stroke, spontaneous overall UE movement is reduced, and movement shifts to unilateral use of the nonparetic UE. Thus, spontaneously-arising UE motor behaviors early after stroke are potential substrates for two mechanisms associated with poorer motor outcomes in animal models: learned non-use and inhibition of motor recovery through training of the nonparetic side. Accurate UE motor assessment requires two independent constructs: motor performance and quantity of movement. These findings provide opportunities and measurement methods for studies to develop new behaviorally-based stroke recovery treatments that begin early after onset.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCompletion along continuum of care for maternal and newborn health(MNH) service like antenatal care, skilled birth attendance and postnatal care services is one of the currently recommended strategies to reduce both maternal and neonatal mortality to achieve the global target of ending preventable maternal and under five childrens mortality. Although studies on factors affecting each segment of MNH services were well documented in Ethiopia, there is a dearth of evidence on the level of continuum of care and factors associated with it. Thus, this study tries to fill this gap in the country in general and in the study area in particular.\\n\\nMethodsA community-based cross sectional study was conducted among 438 postnatal women who gave births in the last one year in Arba Minch Health and Demographic Surveillance Site. The sample women were selected by using computer generated random numbers from the list of women who gone at least six-weeks after birth. A pre-tested structured interviewer-administered questionnaire was used for data collection. Data was entered and coded in Epi-data and analysed using SPSS software version 23. Binary logistic regression model was fitted to identify factors associated with the outcome variable.\\n\\nResultsThe overall completion along the continuum of care was 42(9.7%). The factors significantly associated with continuum of care completion were early antenatal booking (before 16 weeks) [AOR: 10.751, CI (5.095, 22.688], birth preparedness and complication readiness [AOR: 2.934, CI (1.414, 6.087), pre-pregnancy contraception utilization [AOR: 3.963, CI: 1.429,\\n\\n10.990], employed women [AOR: 2.586, CI: ((1.245, 5.371))], and planned pregnancy [AOR: 3.494 CI :(1.068, 11.425)].\\n\\nConclusionCompletion along continuum of care was low in the study area. Thus, efforts in improving completion of the cares should focus on early booking during antenatal period, reducing unplanned pregnancy, and improvement on birth preparedness and complication readiness interventions.",

    "abstract": "During mitotic cell division, the actomyosin cytoskeleton undergoes several dynamic changes that play key roles in progression through mitosis. While the regulators of cytokinetic ring formation and contraction are well-established, proteins that regulate cortical stability during anaphase and telophase have been understudied. Here, we describe a role for CLIC4 in regulating actin and actin-regulators at the cortex and cytokinetic cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. We first describe CLIC4 as a new component of the cytokinetic cleavage furrow that is required for successful completion of mitotic cell division. We also demonstrate that CLIC4 regulates the remodeling of sub-plasma membrane actomyosin network within the furrow by recruiting MST4 kinase and regulating ezrin phosphorylation. This work identifies and characterizes new molecular players involved in the transition from the contracting cytokinetic ring to the intercellular bridge during cytokinesis.",

    "abstract": "Cells encounter a wide variety of physical and chemical cues when navigating their native environments. However, their response to multiple simultaneous cues is not yet clear. In particular, the influence of topography, in the presence of a chemotactic gradient, on their migratory behavior is understudied. Here, we investigate the effects of topographical guidance on highly motile amoeboid cell migration (topotaxis) generated by asymmetrically placed micropillars. The micropillar field allows for an additional, natural chemotactic gradient in two different directions, thereby revealing the relevance of topotaxis in the presence of cell migration directed by chemical gradients (chemotaxis). Interestingly, we found that the topotactic drift generated by the pillar field is conserved during chemotaxis. We show that the drifts generated by both these cues add up linearly. A coarse-grained analysis as a function of pillar spacing subsequently revealed that the strength and direction of the topotactic drift is determined by (i) the pore size, (ii) space between pores, and (iii) the effective diffusion constant of the cells. Finally, we argue that topotaxis must be conserved during chemotaxis, as it is an emergent property of both the asymmetric properties of the pillar field and the inherent stochasticity of (biased) amoeboid migration.",
