    "abstract": "The fairness of scholarly peer review has been challenged by evidence of disparities in publication outcomes based on author demographic characteristics. To assess this, we conducted an exploratory analysis of peer review outcomes of 23,876 initial submissions and 7,192 full submissions that were submitted to the biosciences journal eLife between 2012 and 2017. Women and authors from nations outside of North America and Europe were underrepresented both as gatekeepers (editors and peer reviewers) and authors. We found evidence of a homophilic relationship between the demographics of the gatekeepers and authors and the outcome of peer review; that is, there were higher rates of acceptance in the case of gender and country homophily. The acceptance rate for manuscripts with male last authors was seven percent, or 3.5 percentage points, greater than for female last authors (95% CI = [0.5, 6.4]); this gender inequity was greatest, at nine percent or about 4.8 percentage points (95% CI = [0.3, 9.1]), when the team of reviewers was all male; this difference was smaller and not significantly different for mixed-gender reviewer teams. Homogeny between countries of the gatekeeper and the corresponding author was also associated with higher acceptance rates for many countries. To test for the persistence of these effects after controlling for potentially confounding variables, we conducted a logistic regression including document and author metadata. Disparities in acceptance rates associated with gender and country of affiliation and the homophilic associations remained. We conclude with a discussion of mechanisms that could contribute to this effect, directions for future research, and policy implications. Code and anonymized data have been made available at https://github.com/murrayds/elife-analysis\\n\\nAuthor summaryPeer review, the primary method by which scientific work is evaluated, is ideally a fair and equitable process in which scientific work is judged solely on its own merit. However, the integrity of peer review has been called into question based on evidence that outcomes often differ between male and female authors, and for authors in different countries. We investigated such disparities at the biosciences journal eLife by analyzing the demographics of authors and gatekeepers (editors and peer reviewers), and peer review outcomes of all submissions between 2012 and 2017. Outcomes were more favorable for male authors and those affiliated with institutions in North America and Europe; these groups were also over-represented among gatekeepers. There was evidence that peer review outcomes were influenced by homophily --a preference of gatekeepers for manuscripts from authors with shared characteristics. We discuss mechanisms that could contribute to this effect, directions for future research, and policy implications.",

    "abstract": "In social insects, non-nestmates interactions are typically agonistic and many factors may influence the degree of exhibited aggression. Two of these factors are the physical proximity between nests and the chemical dissimilarity between colonies chemical signatures. We studied a population sample of 43 colonies of Cataglyphis niger ants distributed along a transect of [~]4KM. This geographic distribution allowed us to examine correlations of aggression levels with physical and chemical distances. Ants were collected before mating season, when sexuals (unmated gynes and drones) could be found in nests. In our sample, colonies had either gynes or drones but never both. The presence of sexuals, therefore, was another factor we took into account in our behavioral analyses. Workers from nests with sexuals were more aggressive towards conspecifics than workers from nests where sexuals were absent. We also found those workers to be more vigorously active towards colonies with greater chemical distances, while workers from nests without sexuals were indifferent to chemical distances. We therefore concluded that ants are able to detect differences in chemical dissimilarity, but their aggression levels are mainly determined by other mechanisms. A possible additional mechanism is associative learning and long term memory of the chemical signatures of neighboring colonies. Such learning is supported by our finding that aggression is higher towards neighboring nests, which is in line with the previously reported  nasty neighbour effect in Cataglyphis ants. These results suggest that previous experience and learning of neural templates representing neighbors chemical cues is a stronger component than chemical dissimilarity in the mechanisms which determine aggression towards conspecifics in this species. We discuss possible explanations for the observed effect of the presence of sexuals on agonistic behavior and responsiveness to chemical distances.",

    "abstract": "The functional and structural resemblance of organoids to mammalian organs suggests that they might follow the same allometric scaling rules. However, despite their remarkable likeness to downscaled organs, non-luminal organoids are often reported to possess necrotic cores due to oxygen diffusion limits. To assess their potential as physiologically relevant in vitro models, we determined the range of organoid masses in which quarter power scaling as well as a minimum threshold oxygen concentration is maintained. Using data on brain organoids as a reference, computational models were developed to estimate oxygen consumption and diffusion at different stages of growth. The results show that mature brain (or other non-luminal) organoids generated using current protocols must lie within a narrow range of masses to maintain both quarter power scaling and viable cores. However, micro-fluidic oxygen delivery methods could be designed to widen this range, ensuring a minimum viable oxygen threshold throughout the constructs and mass dependent metabolic scaling. The results provide new insights into the significance of the allometric exponent in systems without a resource-supplying network and may be used to guide the design of more predictive and physiologically relevant in vitro models, providing an effective alternative to animals in research.",

    "abstract": "1.BackgroundMalaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum is one of the major threats to human health globally. Despite huge efforts in malaria control and eradication, highly effective vaccines are urgently needed, including vaccines that can block malaria transmission. Chimeric virus-like particles (VLP) have emerged as a promising strategy to develop new malaria vaccine candidates.\\n\\nMethodsWe developed yeast cell lines and processes for the expression of malaria transmission-blocking vaccine candidates Pfs25 and Pfs230 as VLP and VLP were analyzed for purity, size, protein incorporation rate and expression of malaria antigens.\\n\\nResultsIn this study, a novel platform for the display of Plasmodium falciparum antigens on chimeric VLP is presented. Leading transmission-blocking vaccine candidates Pfs25 and Pfs230 were genetically fused to the small surface protein (dS) of the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV). The resulting fusion proteins were co-expressed in recombinant Hansenula polymorpha (syn. Pichia angusta, Ogataea polymorpha) strains along with the wild-type dS as the VLP scaffold protein. Through this strategy, chimeric VLP containing Pfs25 or the Pfs230-derived fragments Pfs230c or Pfs230D1M were purified. Up to 100 mg chimeric VLP were isolated from 100 g dry cell weight with a maximum protein purity of 90 % on the protein level. Expression of the Pfs230D1M construct was more efficient than Pfs230c and enabled VLP with higher purity. VLP showed reactivity with transmission-blocking antibodies and supported the surface display of the malaria antigens on the native VLP.\\n\\nConclusionThe incorporation of leading Plasmodium falciparum transmission-blocking antigens into the dS-based VLP scaffold is a promising novel strategy for their display on nano-scaled particles. Competitive processes for efficient production and purification were established in this study.",

    "abstract": "Obtaining estimates of animal population density is a key step in providing sound conservation and management strategies for wildlife. For many large carnivores however, estimating density is difficult because these species are elusive and wide-ranging. Here, we focus on providing the first density estimates of the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) in the French Jura and Vosges mountains. We sampled a total of 413 camera trapping sites (with 2 cameras per site) between January 2011 and April 2016 in seven study areas across seven counties of the French Jura and Vosges mountains. We obtained 592 lynx detections over 19,035 trap days in the Jura mountain and 0 detection over 6,804 trap days in the Vosges mountain. Based on coat patterns, we identified a total number of 92 unique individuals from photographs, including 16 females, 13 males and 63 individuals of unknown sex. Using spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models, we estimated abundance in the study areas between 5 (SE = 0.1) and 29 (0.2) lynx and density between 0.24 (SE = 0.02) and 0.91 (SE = 0.03) lynx per 100 km2. We also provide a comparison with non-spatial density estimates and discuss the expected discrepancies. Our study is yet another example of the advantage of combining SCR methods and non-invasive sampling techniques to estimate density for elusive and wide-ranging species, like large carnivores. While the estimated densities in the French Jura mountain are comparable to other lynx populations in Europe, the fact that we detected no lynx in the Vosges mountain is alarming. Connectivity should be encouraged between the French Jura mountain, the Vosges mountain and the Palatinate Forest in Germany where a reintroduction program is currently ongoing. Our density estimates will help in setting a baseline conservation status for the lynx population in France.",

Serial section transmission electron microscopy (ssTEM) is among the most prolific imaging methods employed in pursuit of such reconstructions. We demonstrate how Flood-Filling Networks (FFNs) can be used to computationally segment a forty-teravoxel whole-brain Drosophila ssTEM volume. To compensate for data irregularities and imperfect global alignment, FFNs were combined with procedures that locally re-align serial sections as well as dynamically adjust and synthesize image content. The proposed approach produced a largely merger-free segmentation of the entire ssTEM Drosophila brain, which we make freely available. As compared to manual tracing using an efficient skeletonization strategy, the segmentation enabled circuit reconstruction and analysis workflows that were an order of magnitude faster.",

Precise analysis of complex neural circuits requires high-density integration of multiple cellular-size light sources and recording electrodes.

We present minimal-stimulation-artifact (miniSTAR) {micro}LED optoelectrodes that enable effective elimination of stimulation artifact. A multi-metal-layer structure with a shielding layer effectively suppresses capacitive coupling of stimulation signals. A heavily-boron-doped silicon substrate silences the photovoltaic effect induced from LED illumination. With transient stimulation pulse shaping, we reduced stimulation artifact on miniSTAR {micro}LED optoelectrodes to below 50 {micro}Vpp, much smaller than a typical spike detection threshold, at optical stimulation of > 50 mW mm-2 irradiance. We demonstrated high-temporal resolution (< 1 ms) opto-electrophysiology without any artifact-induced signal quality degradation during in vivo experiments.

    "abstract": "Hypoxia, a low level of oxygen in the tissue, is a feature of most solid tumors. It arises due to an imbalance between the oxygen supply from the abnormal vasculature and oxygen demand by the large number of tumor and stromal cells. Hypoxia has been implicated in the development of aggressive tumors and tumor resistance to various therapies. This makes hypoxia a negative marker of patients survival. However, recent advances in designing new hypoxia-activated pro-drugs and adoptive T cell therapies provide an opportunity for exploiting hypoxia in order to improve cancer treatment. We used novel mathematical models of micro-pharmacology and computational optimization techniques for determining the most effective treatment protocols that take advantage of heterogeneous and dynamically changing oxygenation in in vivo tumors. These models were applied to design schedules for a combination of three therapeutic compounds in pancreatic cancers and determine the most effective adoptive T cell therapy protocols in melanomas.",

    "abstract": "The {beta}-sheet is an element of protein secondary structure, and intra-/inter-molecular {beta}-sheet interactions play pivotal roles in biological regulatory processes including scaffolding, transporting, and oligomerization. In nature, a {beta}-sheet formation is tightly regulated because dysregulated {beta}-stacking often leads to severe diseases such as Alzheimers, Parkinsons, systemic amyloidosis, or diabetes. Thus, the identification of intrinsic {beta}-sheet forming propensities can provide valuable insight into protein designs for the development of novel therapeutics. However, structure-based design methods may not be generally applicable to such amyloidogenic peptides mainly owing to high structural plasticity and complexity. Therefore, an alternative design strategy based on complementary sequence information is of significant importance. Herein, we developed a database search method called B-SIDER for the design of complementary {beta}-strands. This method makes use of the structural database information and generates query-specific score matrices. The discriminatory power of the B-SIDER score function was tested on representative amyloidogenic peptide substructures against a sequence-based score matrix (PASTA2.0) and two popular ab initio protein design score functions (Rosetta and FoldX). B-SIDER is able to distinguish wild-type amyloidogenic {beta}-strands as favored interactions in a more consistent manner than other methods. B-SIDER was prospectively applied to the design of complementary {beta}-strands for a splitGFP scaffold. Three variants were identified to have stronger interactions than the original sequence selected through a directed evolution, emitting higher fluorescence intensities. Our results indicate that B-SIDER can be applicable to the design of other {beta}-strands, assisting in the development of therapeutics against disease-related amyloidogenic peptides.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic DNA-based data storage systems have received significant attention due to the promise of ultrahigh storage density and long-term stability. However, all platforms proposed so far suffer from high cost, read-write latency and error-rates that render them noncompetitive with modern optical and magnetic storage devices. One means to avoid synthesizing DNA and to reduce the system error-rates is to use readily available native DNA. As the symbol/nucleotide content of native DNA is fixed, one may adopt an alternative recording strategy that modifies the DNA topology to encode desired information. Here, we report the first macromolecular storage paradigm in which data is written in the form of \"nicks (punches)\" at predetermined positions on the sugar-phosphate backbone of native dsDNA. The platform accommodates parallel nicking on multiple \"orthogonal\" genomic DNA fragments and paired nicking and disassociation for creating \"toehold\" regions that enable single-bit random access and strand displacement in-memory computations. As a proof of concept, we used the programmable restriction enzyme Pyrococcus furiosus Argonaute to punch two files into the PCR products of Escherichia coli genomic DNA. The encoded data is accurately reconstructed through high-throughput sequencing and read alignment.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive deficits are important predictors for outcome, independence and quality of life after stroke, but often remain unnoticed and unattended because other impairments are more evident. Computerized cognitive training (CCT) is among the candidate interventions that may alleviate cognitive difficulties, but the evidence supporting its feasibility and effectiveness is scarce, partly due to the lack of tools for outcome prediction and monitoring. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides candidate markers for disease monitoring and outcome prediction. By integrating information not only about lesion extent and localization, but also regarding the integrity of the unaffected parts of the brain, advanced MRI provides relevant information for developing better prediction models in order to tailor cognitive intervention for patients, especially in a chronic phase.\\n\\nUsing brain age prediction based on MRI based brain morphometry and machine learning, we tested the hypotheses that stroke patients with a younger-appearing brain relative to their chronological age perform better on cognitive tests and benefit more from cognitive training compared to patients with an older-appearing brain. In this randomized double-blind study, 54 patients who suffered mild stroke (>6 months since hospital admission, NIHSS<7 at hospital discharge) underwent 3-weeks CCT and MRI before and after the intervention. In addition, patients were randomized to one of two groups receiving either active or sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). We tested for main effects of brain age gap (estimated age - chronological age) on cognitive performance, and associations between brain age gap and task improvement. Finally, we tested if longitudinal changes in brain age gap during the intervention were sensitive to treatment response. Briefly, our results suggest that longitudinal brain age prediction based on automated brain morphometry is feasible and reliable in stroke patients. However, no significant association between brain age and both performance and response to cognitive training were found.",

    "abstract": "Activity dependent plasticity is the brains mechanism for reshaping neural connections. Representing activity by graph diffusion, we model plasticity as adaptive rewiring. The rewiring involves adding shortcut connections where diffusion on the graph is intensive while pruning underused ones. This process robustly steers initially random networks to high-levels of structural complexity reflecting the global characteristics of brain anatomy: modular or centralized small world topologies, depending on overall diffusion rate. We extend this result, known from binary networks, to weighted ones in order to evaluate the flexibility of their evolved states. Both with normally- and lognormally-distributed weights, networks evolve modular or centralized topologies depending on a single control parameter, the diffusion rate, representing a global homeostatic or normalizing regulation mechanism. Once settled, normally weighted networks lock into their topologies, whereas lognormal ones allow flexible switching between them, tuned by the diffusion rate. For a small range of diffusion rates networks evolve the largest variety of topologies: modular, centralized or intermediate. Weighted networks in the transition range show topological but not weighted rich-club structure matching empirical data in the human brain. The simulation results allow us to propose adaptive rewiring based on diffusion as a parsimonious model for activity-dependent reshaping of the brains connections.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe brain is adapting continuously to a changing environment by strengthening or adding new connections and weakening or pruning existing ones. This forms the basis of flexible and adaptable behaviors. On the other hand, uncontrolled changes to the wiring can compromise the stability of the brain as an adaptive system. We used an abstract model to investigate how this basic problem could be addressed from a graph-theoretical perspective. The model adaptively rewires an initially randomly connected network into a more structured one with properties akin to the human brain, such as small worldness and rich club structure. The adaptive changes made to the network follow the heat diffusion, an abstract representation of brain functional connectivity. Moreover, depending on a parameter of the model, the heat diffusion rate, either modular or centralized connectivity patterns emerge, both found across different regions of the brain. For a narrow range of intermediate heat diffusion rates, networks develop a full range from modular to centralized connectivity patterns. Once settled into a connectivity pattern networks with normally distributed weights lock into that state, whereas networks with lognormally distributed weights show greater flexibility to adjust, while maintaining their small-world and rich club properties. Networks with lognormally distributed weights, therefore, show the combination of stability and flexibility needed to address the fundamental requirements of adaptive networks.",

    "abstract": "Induction of intestinal drug metabolizing enzymes can complicate the development of new drugs, owing to potential to cause drug-drug interactions (DDIs) leading to changes in pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy. The development of a human relevant model of the adult intestine that accurately predicts CYP450 induction could help address this challenge as species differences preclude extrapolation from animals. Here, we combined organoids and Organ-Chip technology to create a human Duodenum Intestine-Chip that emulates intestinal tissue architecture and functions, that are relevant for the study of drug transport, metabolism, and DDI. Duodenum Intestine-Chip demonstrates the polarized cell architecture, intestinal barrier function, presence of specialized cell subpopulations, and in vivo-relevant expression, localization, and function of major intestinal drug transporters. Notably, in comparison to Caco-2, it displays improved CYP3A4 expression and induction capability. This model could enable improved in vitro to in vivo extrapolation for better predictions of human pharmacokinetics and risk of DDIs.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTPlants distinguish the pollen grains that land on their stigmas, only allowing compatible pollen to fertilize female gametes. To analyze the underlying mechanism, conditional male-sterile mutations with affected pollen coat and disrupted pollen-stigma recognition were isolated and described. The mutant pollen failed to germinate, but germinated in vitro, suggesting that they are viable. In mutants, stigma cells that contacted their own pollen generated callose, a carbohydrate produced in response to foreign pollen. High humidity restored pollen hydration and successful fertilization, indicating defective dehydration in pollen-stigma interaction. Further analysis results from mixed pollination experiments demonstrated that the mutant pollen specifically lacked a functional pollen-stigma recognition system. The sterile plants lacked stem waxes and displayed postgenital fusion between aerial floral organs. In addition, the mutant pollen was deficient in long-chain lipids and had excess tryphine. Transmission electron microscopy observation showed that mutant pollen had almost the same surface structure as the wild type at bicellular pollen stage. However, abnormal plastoglobuli were observed in the plastids of the mutant tapetum, which was indicative of altered lipid accumulation. CER3 transcript was found in anther tapetum and microspores at development stage 9 while CER3-GFP fusion protein was localized to the cell plasma membrane. Our data reveal that CER3 is required for biosynthesis of tryphine lipids which play a critical role in maintaining hydration for pollen-stigma recognition during fertilization.",

    "abstract": "The lipidic cubic phase (LCP) technique has proved to facilitate the growth of high-quality crystals that are otherwise difficult to grow by other methods. Because crystals grown in LCP can be limited in size, improved techniques for structure determination from these small crystals are important. Microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) is a technique that uses a cryo-TEM to collect electron diffraction data and determine high-resolution structures from very thin micro and nanocrystals. In this work, we have used modified LCP and MicroED protocols to analyze crystals embedded in LCP. Proteinase K in LCP was used as a model system, and several LCP sample preparation strategies were tested. Among these, treatment with 2-Methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) and lipase were both able to reduce the viscosity of the LCP and produce quality cryo-EM grids with well-diffracting crystals. These results set the stage for the use of MicroED to analyze other microcrystalline samples grown in LCP.",

    "abstract": "Synovial sarcoma is an aggressive mesenchymal neoplasm, driven by the SS18-SSX fusion, and characterized by immunogenic antigens expression and exceptionally low T cell infiltration levels. To study the cancer-immune interplay in this disease, we profiled 16,872 cells from 12 human synovial sarcoma tumors using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq). Synovial sarcoma manifests antitumor immunity, high cellular plasticity and a core oncogenic program, which is predictive of low immune levels and poor clinical outcomes. Using genetic and pharmacological perturbations, we demonstrate that the program is controlled by the SS18-SSX driver and repressed by cytokines secreted by macrophages and T cells in the tumor microenvironment. Network modeling predicted that SS18-SSX promotes the program through HDAC1 and CDK6. Indeed, the combination of HDAC and CDK4/6 inhibitors represses the program, induces immunogenic cell states, and selectively targets synovial sarcoma cells. Our study demonstrates that immune evasion, cellular plasticity, and cell cycle are co-regulated and can be co-targeted in synovial sarcoma and potentially in other malignancies.",

This unbiased approach identified 17 mutant phenotypes and [~]1600 genes whose perturbation affected at least one of the four compartments. Numerous mutants were associated with multiple phenotypes, indicating that morphological pleiotropy is often seen within the endocytic pathway. Morphological profiles based on the 17 aberrant phenotypes were highly correlated for functionally related genes, enabling prediction of gene function. Incomplete penetrance was prevalent, and single-cell analysis enabled exploration of the mechanisms underlying cellular heterogeneity, which include replicative age, organelle inheritance, and stress response.",

    "abstract": "Protein structures are dynamic, undergoing specific motions that can play a vital role in function. However, the link between primary sequence and conformational dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we studied how conformational dynamics can arise in a globular protein by evaluating the impact of individual substitutions of core residues in DANCER-3, a streptococcal protein G domain {beta}1 (G{beta}1) variant that we previously designed to undergo a specific mode of conformational exchange that has never been observed in the wild-type protein. Using a combination of solution NMR experiments and molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that only two mutations are necessary to create this conformational exchange, and that these mutations work synergistically, with one destabilizing the native G{beta}1 structure and the other allowing two new conformational states to be accessed on the energy landscape. Overall, our results show how conformational dynamics can appear in a stable globular fold, a critical step in the molecular evolution of new dynamics-linked functions.",

Besides this pathological aggregation, TDP-43s oligomerization also serves vital functions3, which adds urgency to determine pathological conformations of TDP-43. The recently published cryo-EM study by Cao, Eisenberg and coworkers now reveals amyloid structures of putative pathological aggregates from TDP-43s C-terminal region4. Whereas the Cao et al.s cryo-EM structures contain both the hydrophobic and Q/N-rich segments, the data were interpreted mainly through the lens of hydrophobic contacts. However, the Q/N-rich region can form amyloid on its own5,6 and therefore additional considerations of the Q/N-rich segments contributions will advance our understanding of TDP-43 aggregation.",

However, whether a NF homolog exists in C. elegans remains unclear. We characterize TAG-63 as a NF-like protein with sequence homologies to human NEFH carrying various coiled coils as well as clustered phosphorylation sites. TAG-63 also exhibits features of NFL such as a molecular weight of around 70 kD, the lack of KSP repeats and the ability to form 10 nm filamentous structures in transmission electron micrographs. An anti-NEFH antibody detects a band at the predicted molecular weight of TAG-63 in Western blots of whole worm lysates and this band cannot be detected in tag-63 knockout worms. A transcriptional tag-63 reporter expresses in a broad range of neurons, and various anti-NFH antibodies stain worm neurons with an overlapping expression of axonal vesicle transporter UNC-104(KIF1A). Cultured neurons grow shorter axons when incubating with drugs known to disintegrate the NF network and rhodamine-labeled in vitro reconstituted TAG-63 filaments disintegrate upon drug exposure. Speeds of UNC-104 motors are diminished in tag-63 mutant worms with visibly increased accumulations of motors along axons.

    "abstract": "Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is primarily caused by mutations in the NPC1 gene and is characterized by the accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and lipids in the late endosomal (LE) and lysosomal (Ly) compartments. The most prevalent disease-linked mutation is the I1061T variant of NPC1, which exhibits defective folding and trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the LE/Ly compartments. We now show that the FDA-approved histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) valproic acid (VPA) corrects the folding and trafficking defect associated with I1061T-NPC1 leading to restoration of cholesterol homeostasis, an effect that is largely driven by a reduction in HDAC7 expression. The VPA-mediated trafficking correction is in part associated with an increase in the acetylation of lysine residues in the cysteine-rich domain of NPC1. The HDACi-mediated correction is synergistically improved by combining it with the FDA-approved anti-malarial, chloroquine, a known lysosomotropic compound, which improved the stability of the LE/Ly-localized fraction of the I1061T variant. We posit that combining the activity of VPA, to modulate epigentically the cellular acetylome, with chloroquine, to alter the lysosomal environment to favor stability of the trafficked I1061T variant protein, can have a significant therapeutic benefit in patients carrying at least one copy of the I1061T variant of NPC1, the most common disease-associated mutation leading to NPC disease. Given its ability to cross the blood brain barrier, we posit VPA provides a potential mechanism to improve the response to 2-hydroxypropyl-{beta}-cyclodextrin, by restoring functional NPC1 to cholesterol managing compartment as an adjunct therapy.",

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) causes severe disability of children and death of young men, with an incidence of approximately 1/5,000 male births. Symptoms appear in early childhood, with a diagnosis made around 4 years old, a time where the amount of muscle damage is already significant, preventing early therapeutic interventions that could be more efficient at halting disease progression. In the meantime, the precise moment at which disease phenotypes arise - even asymptomatically - is still unknown. Thus, there is a critical need to better define DMD onset as well as its first manifestations, which could help identify early disease biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets.\n\nIn this study, we have used human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from DMD patients to model skeletal myogenesis, and compared their differentiation dynamics to that of healthy control cells by a comprehensive multi-omic analysis. Transcriptome and miRnome comparisons combined with protein analyses at 7 time points demonstrated that hiPSC differentiation 1) mimics described DMD phenotypes at the differentiation endpoint; and 2) homogeneously and robustly recapitulates key developmental steps - mesoderm, somite, skeletal muscle - which offers the possibility to explore dystrophin functions and find earlier disease biomarkers.\n\nStarting at the somite stage, mitochondrial gene dysregulations escalate during differentiation. We also describe fibrosis as an intrinsic feature of skeletal muscle cells that starts early during myogenesis. In sum, our data strongly argue for an early developmental manifestation of DMD whose onset is triggered before the entry into the skeletal muscle compartment, data leading to a necessary reconsideration of dystrophin functions during muscle development.",

    "abstract": "The application of statistical methods to comparatively framed questions about protein dynamics can potentially enable investigations of biomolecular function beyond the current sequence and structural methods in bioinformatics. However, chaotic behavior in single protein trajectories requires statistical inference be obtained from large ensembles of molecular dynamic (MD) simulations representing the comparative functional states of a given protein. Meaningful interpretation of such a complex form of big data poses serious challenges to users of MD. Here, we announce DROIDS v3.0, a molecular dynamic (MD) method + software package for comparative protein dynamics, incorporating many new features including maxDemon v1.0, a multi-method machine learning application that trains on large ensemble comparisons of concerted protein motions in opposing functional states and deploys learned classifications of these states onto newly generated protein dynamic simulations. Local canonical correlations in learning patterns generated from self-similar MD runs are used to identify regions of functionally conserved protein dynamics. Subsequent impacts of genetic and drug class variants on conserved dynamics can also be analyzed by deploying the classifiers on variant MD runs and quantifying how often these altered protein systems display the opposing functional states. Here, we present several case studies of complex changes in functional protein dynamics caused by temperature, genetic mutation, and binding interaction with nucleic acids and small molecules. We studied the impact of genetic variation on functionally conserved protein dynamics in ubiquitin and TATA binding protein and demonstrate that our learning algorithm can properly identify regions of conserved dynamics. We also report impacts to dynamics that correspond well with predicted disruptive effects of a variety of genetic mutations. In addition, we studied the impact of drug class variation on the ATP binding region of Hsp90, similarly identifying conserved dynamics and impacts that rank accordingly with how closely various Hsp90 inhibitors mimic natural ATP binding.\\n\\nStatement of significanceWe propose a statistical method as well as offer a user-friendly graphical interfaced software pipeline for comparing simulations of the complex motions (i.e. dynamics) of proteins in different functional states. We also provide both method and software to apply artificial intelligence (i.e. machine learning methods) that enable the computer to recognize complex functional differences in protein dynamics on new simulations and report them to the user. This method can identify dynamics important for protein function, as well as to quantify how the motions of molecular variants differ from these important functional dynamic states. For the first time, this method of analysis allows the impacts of different genetic backgrounds or drug classes to be examined within the context of functional motions of the specific protein system under investigation.",

Furthermore, in human microcephalic fetal brain tissue, ZikV-NS5 persists at the base of the motile cilia in ependymal cells, which also exhibit a severe ciliopathy. While the enzymatic activity of ZikV-NS5 appears to be dispensable, the Y25, K28 and K29 residues in the protein, that are involved in NS5-oligomerization, are essential for the localization and interaction with components of the cilium base, promoting ciliopathy and premature neurogenesis.

CHD4 is essential for growth of multiple patient derived melanoma xenografts and for breast cancer. Here we show that CHD4 regulates expression of PADI1 (Protein Arginine Deiminase 1) and PADI3 in multiple cancer cell types modulating citrullination of three arginines of the allosterically-regulated glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). Citrullination reprograms cross-talk between PKM2 ligands lowering its sensitivity to the inhibitors Tryptophan, Alanine and Phenylalanine and promoting activation by Serine. Citrullination thus bypasses normal physiological regulation by low Serine levels to promote excessive glycolysis defining a novel pathway regulating proliferation of melanoma and other cancer cells. We provide unique insight as to how conversion of arginines to citrulline impacts key interactions within PKM2 that act in concert to reprogram its activity as an additional mechanism regulating this important enzyme.",

    "abstract": "Apolipoproteins are involved in pathological conditions of Alzheimers disease (AD), truncated apolipoprotein fragments and {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) peptides coexist as neurotoxic heteromers within the plaques. Therefore, it is important to investigate these complexes at the molecular level to better understand their properties and roles in the pathology of AD. Here, we present a mechanistic insight into such heteromerization using a structurally homologue apolipoprotein fragment of apoA-I (4F) complexed with A{beta}(M1-42) and characterize their toxicity. The 4F peptide slows down the aggregation kinetics of A{beta}(M1-42) by constraining its structural plasticity. NMR and CD experiments identified 4F-A{beta}(M1-42) heteromers as being comprised of unstructured A{beta}(M1-42) and helical 4F. A uniform {approx}2-fold reduction in A{beta}42 15N/1H NMR signal intensities with no observable chemical shift perturbation indicated the formation of a large complex, which was further confirmed by diffusion NMR experiments. Microsecond scale atomistic molecular dynamics simulations showed that 4F interaction with A{beta}(M1-42) is electrostatically driven and induces unfolding of A{beta}(M1-42). Neurotoxicity profiling of A{beta}(M1-42) complexed with 4F confirms a significant reduction in cell-viability and neurite growth. The molecular architecture of heteromerization between 4F and A{beta}(M1-42) discovered in this study provides evidence towards our understanding of the role of apolipoproteins or their truncated fragments in exacerbating AD pathology.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) chromatin architectural changes can alter the integrity of topologically associated domains (TADs) and rewire specific enhancer-promoter interactions impacting gene expression. Recently, such alterations have been implicated in human disease, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of their role. Here, we investigate the reorganization of chromatin architecture in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) using primary human leukemia specimens and its dynamic responses to pharmacological agents. Systematic integration of matched in situ Hi-C, RNA-Seq and CTCF ChIP-Seq datasets revealed widespread changes in intra-TAD chromatin interactions and TAD boundary insulation in T-ALL. Our studies identify and focus on a TAD \\\"fusion\\\" event being associated with loss of CTCF-mediated insulation, enabling direct interactions between the MYC promoter and a distal super-enhancer. Moreover, our data show that small molecule inhibitors targeting either oncogenic signal transduction or epigenetic regulation reduce specific 3D interactions associated with transformation. Overall, our study highlights the impact, complexity and dynamic nature of 3D chromatin architecture in human acute leukemia.\\n\\nOne Sentence Summary3D chromatin alterations in T cell leukemia are accompanied by changes in insulation and oncogene expression and can be partially restored by targeted drug treatments.",

    "abstract": "Accurate disease risk prediction is essential in healthcare to provide personalized disease prevention and treatment strategies not only to the patients, but also to the general population. In addition to demographic and environmental factors, advancements in genomic research have revealed that genetics play an important role in determining the susceptibility of diseases. However, for most complex diseases, individual genetic variants are only weakly to moderately associated with the diseases. Thus, they are not clinically informative in determining disease risks. Nevertheless, recent findings suggest that the combined effects from multiple disease-associated variants, or polygenic risk score (PRS), can stratify disease risk similar to that of rare monogenic mutations. The development of polygenic risk score provides a promising tool to evaluate the genetic contribution of disease risk; however, the quality of the risk prediction depends on many contributing factors including the precision of the target phenotypes. In this study, we evaluated the impact of phenotyping errors on the accuracies of PRS risk prediction. We utilized electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network (eMERGE) data to simulate various types of disease phenotypes. For each phenotype, we quantified the impact of phenotyping errors generated from the differential and non-differential mechanism by comparing the prediction accuracies of PRS on the independent testing data. In addition, our results showed that the rate of accuracy degradation depended on both the phenotype and the mechanism of phenotyping error.",

    "abstract": "Understanding 3D genome structure requires high throughput, genome-wide approaches. However, assays for all vs. all chromatin interaction mapping are expensive and time consuming, which severely restricts their usage for large-scale mutagenesis screens or for mapping the impact of sequence variants. Computational models sophisticated enough to grasp the determinants of chromatin folding provide a unique window into the functional determinants of 3D genome structure as well as the effects of genome variation.\\n\\nA chromatin interaction predictor should work at the base pair level but also incorporate large-scale genomic context to simultaneously capture the large scale and intricate structures of chromatin architecture. Similarly, to be a flexible and generalisable approach it should also be applicable to data it has not been explicitly trained on. To develop a model with these properties, we designed a deep neuronal network (deepC) that utilizes transfer learning to accurately predict chromatin interactions from DNA sequence at megabase scale. The model generalizes well to unseen chromosomes and works across cell types, Hi-C data resolutions and a range of sequencing depths. DeepC integrates DNA sequence context on an unprecedented scale, bridging the different levels of resolution from base pairs to TADs. We demonstrate how this model allows us to investigate sequence determinants of chromatin folding at genome-wide scale and to predict the importance of regulatory elements and the impact of sequence variations.",

    "abstract": "Scientific knowledge in the field of ecology is increasingly enriched by data acquired by the general public participating in citizen science (CS) programs. Yet, doubts remain about the reliability of such data, in particular when acquired by school children. We built upon an ongoing CS program - Oak bodyguards - to assess the ability of European schoolchildren to accurately estimate the strength of biotic interactions in terrestrial ecosystems. We used standardized protocols to estimate predation rates on artificial caterpillars and insect herbivory on oak leaves and compared estimates made by school children, trained and untrained professional scientists (with no or limited expertise in predation or herbivory assessment). Compared to trained scientists, both schoolchildren and untrained professional scientists overestimated predation rates, but assessments made by the latter were more consistent. School children overestimated insect herbivory, as did untrained professional scientists. Thus, raw data acquired by school children participating in CS programs cannot be used and require several quality checks. However, such data are of no less value than data collected by untrained professional scientists and can be calibrated for bias.",
