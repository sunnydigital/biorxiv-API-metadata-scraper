    "abstract": "The mortality rate of hemorrhagic African swine fever (ASF), which targets domestic pigs and is caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV), can reach 100%. ASF has been reported in 25 Chinese provinces since August 2018. There is no effective treatment or vaccine for it and the present molecular diagnosis technologies have trade-offs in sensitivity, specificity, cost and speed, and none of them cater perfectly to ASF control. Thus, a technology that overcomes the need for laboratory facilities, is relatively low cost, and rapidly and sensitively detects ASFV would be highly valuable. Here, we describe an RAA-Cas12a-based system that combines recombinase-aided amplification (RAA) and CRISPR/Cas12a for ASFV detection. The fluorescence intensity readout of this system detected ASFV p72 gene levels as low as 10 aM. For on-site ASFV detection, lateral-flow strip readout was introduced for the first time in the RAA-Cas12a based system (named CORDS, Cas12a-based On-site and Rapid Detection System). We used CORDS to detect target DNA highly specifically using the lateral-flow strip readout. CORDS could identify the p72 gene at femtomolar sensitivity in an hour at 37{degrees}C, and only requires an incubator. For ease of use, the regents of CORDS was lyophilized to three tubes and remained the same sensitivity when stored at 4 {degrees}C for at least 7 days. Thus, CORDS provides a rapid, sensitive and easily operable method for ASFV on-site detection. Lyophilized CORDS can withstand long-term transportation and storage, and is ready for field applications.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundObesity is an important public health problem and rates have reached epidemic proportions in many countries. Studies have explored the association between infants delivered by caesarean section and their later life risk of obesity, in many countries outside Africa. As a result of the increasing caesarean section and obesity rates in South Africa, we investigated the association in this country.\\n\\nMethodsThis was a retrospective analysis of data that were collected from a prospective South African birth cohort (Birth to Twenty Plus), established in 1990. A total of 889 young adults aged 21-24 years were included in the analysis. Multiple logistic regression models were fitted to assess the association between mode of delivery and early adulthood obesity.\\n\\nResultsOf the 889 young adults, 106 (11.9%) were obese while 72 (8.1%) were delivered by CS; of which 14 (19.4%) were obese. Caesarean section delivery was significantly associated with obesity in young adults after adjusting for potential confounders like gestational age (at delivery), birth weight, sex, maternal age, parity and education (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.00-3.94, p=0.049).\\n\\nConclusionThe association of caesarean section with early adulthood obesity should be interpreted with caution because data on certain key confounding factors such as mothers pre-pregnancy body mass index and gestational diabetes were not available. Further research from Africa, with larger sample sizes and databases with useful linking of maternal and infant data, should be conducted.",

    "abstract": "Cortical areas comprise multiple types of inhibitory interneurons with stereotypical connectivity motifs, but their combined effect on postsynaptic dynamics has been largely unexplored. Here, we analyse the response of a single postsynaptic model neuron receiving tuned excitatory connections alongside inhibition from two plastic populations. Depending on the inhibitory plasticity rule, synapses remain unspecific (flat), become anti-correlated to, or mirror excitatory synapses. Crucially, the neurons receptive field, i.e., its response to presynaptic stimuli, depends on the modulatory state of inhibition. When both inhibitory populations are active, inhibition balances excitation, resulting in uncorrelated postsynaptic responses regardless of the inhibitory tuning profiles. Modulating the activity of a given inhibitory population produces strong correlations to either preferred or non-preferred inputs, in line with recent experimental findings showing dramatic context-dependent changes of neurons receptive fields. We thus confirm that a neurons receptive field doesnt follow directly from the weight profiles of its presynaptic afferents.",

    "abstract": "The striatum is a critical brain region for locomotor response to cocaine. Although the D1 receptor-expressing neurons are centrally involved in mediating the locomotor effects of cocaine, the molecular pathways controlling this response are not fully understood. Here we studied the role of Pyk2, a non-receptor calcium-dependent protein-tyrosine kinase, in striatum-related functions. We discovered that cocaine injection increases Pyk2 phosphorylation in the striatum of mice in vivo. Pyk2-deficient mice displayed an altered locomotor response to acute cocaine injection. In contrast, they developed normal locomotor sensitization and cocaine-conditioned place preference. Accordingly, a cocaine-activated signaling pathway essential for these late responses, ERK phosphorylation, was not altered. Specific deletion of Pyk2 in the nucleus accumbens or in D1 neurons reproduced this phenotype, whereas deletion of Pyk2 in the dorsal striatum or in A2A receptor-expressing neurons did not. Mice lacking Pyk2 in D1-neurons also displayed lower locomotor response to the D1 receptor agonist SKF-81297 but not to an anticholinergic drug. Our results identify Pyk2 as a regulator of acute locomotor responses to psychostimulants and suggest that changes in Pyk2 expression or activation may alter specific responses to drugs of abuse, or possibly other behavioral responses linked to dopamine action.",

    "abstract": "We used event-related brain potentials to identify the neurophysiological responses of Arabic speakers to processing full and deflected agreement in plural noun-adjective constructions in Standard Arabic. Under full agreement, an adjective fully agrees in number and gender with a preceding plural noun, but only when this noun is human, while it is systematically marked feminine singular when the noun is non-human under deflected agreement. We recorded grammaticality judgment and ERP responses from 32 speakers of Arabic to sentences violating full and deflected agreement and their well-formed counterparts. The participants were relatively fast and accurate in judging all the sentences, although violations, especially deflected agreement violations, were not always deemed ungrammatical. However, the ERP responses show a differential processing of human versus non-human violations. Violations of full agreement involving human nouns elicited larger N400 and P600 components than violations of deflected agreement involving non-human nouns, whose ERP signatures were hardly distinguishable from those of their acceptable counterparts. Our results present evidence for animacy (more specifically, humanness) and inter-dialect effects on language processing. We argue that violations of Standard Arabic deflected agreement are not treated as outright violations because non-human referents permit both full and deflected agreement in Spoken Arabic. We discuss these results in light of the ERP literature on agreement processing and the role of animacy/humanness in grammar, and highlight the potential effect of diglossia on the architecture of the mental grammar of Arabic speakers.",

Autocatalytic networks have been discovered in various chemistries, but we lack a general understanding of how network topology controls the Darwinian properties of variation, differential reproduction, and heredity, which are mediated by the chemical composition. Using barcoded sequencing and droplet microfluidics, we establish a landscape of thousands of networks of RNAs that catalyze their own formation from fragments, and derive relationships between network topology and chemical composition. We find that strong variations arise from catalytic innovations perturbing weakly connected networks, and that reproduction increases with global connectivity. These rules imply trade-offs between reproduction and variation, and between compositional persistence and variation along trajectories of network complexification. Overall, connectivity in reaction networks provides a lever to balance variation (to explore chemical states) with reproduction and heredity (persistence being necessary for selection to act), as required for chemical evolution.",

    "abstract": "Many animal species across different taxa change their habitat during their development. An ontogenetic habitat shift enables the development of early vulnerable-to-predation stages in a safe  nursery habitat with reduced predation mortality, while less vulnerable stages can exploit a more risky, rich feeding habitat. Therefore, the timing of the habitat shift is crucial for individual fitness. We investigate the effect that size-selectivity in mortality in the rich feeding habitat has on the optimal timing of the habitat shift using a population model and the adaptive dynamics approach. We show that the size-selective nature of mortality in this habitat affects density-dependent body growth rate in the nursery habitat and thus the optimal timing of the habitat shift. This is caused by the effect exerted by size-dependent mortality on the size distribution of the population that results in strong competition in the nursery habitat. We furthermore find that, as a consequence of this effect, increased size-selectivity in mortality in the rich feeding habitat causes the optimal body size to shift habitat to decrease. Our results reveal the interdependence between population structure and life history traits, and highlight the need for integrating ecological interactions in the study of the evolution of life histories.",

    "abstract": "The RNA exosome is an evolutionarily-conserved ribonuclease complex critically important for precise processing and/or complete degradation of a variety of cellular RNAs. The recent discovery that mutations in genes encoding structural RNA exosome subunits cause tissue-specific diseases makes defining the role of this complex within specific tissues critically important. Mutations in the RNA exosome component 3 (EXOSC3) gene cause Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia Type 1b (PCH1b), an autosomal recessive neurologic disorder. The majority of disease-linked mutations are missense mutations that alter evolutionarily-conserved regions of EXOSC3. The tissue-specific defects caused by these amino acid changes in EXOSC3 are challenging to understand based on current models of RNA exosome function with only limited analysis of the complex in any multicellular model in vivo. The goal of this study is to provide insight into how mutations in EXOSC3 impact the function of the RNA exosome. To assess the tissue-specific roles and requirements for the Drosophila ortholog of EXOSC3 termed Rrp40, we utilized tissue-specific RNAi drivers. Depletion of Rrp40 in different tissues reveals a general requirement for Rrp40 in the development of many tissues including the brain, but also highlight an agedependent requirement for Rrp40 in neurons. To assess the functional consequences of the specific amino acid substitutions in EXOSC3 that cause PCH1b, we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology to generate flies that model this RNA exosome-linked disease. These flies show reduced viability; however, the surviving animals exhibit a spectrum of behavioral and morphological phenotypes. RNA-seq analysis of these Drosophila Rrp40 mutants reveals increases in the steady-state levels of specific mRNAs and ncRNAs, some of which are central to neuronal function. In particular, Arc1 mRNA, which encodes a key regulator of synaptic plasticity, is increased in the Drosophila Rrp40 mutants. Taken together, this study defines a requirement for the RNA exosome in specific tissues/cell types and provides insight into how defects in RNA exosome function caused by specific amino acid substitutions that occur in PCH1b can contribute to neuronal dysfunction.\n\nAuthor SummaryPontocerebellar Hypoplasia Type 1b (PCH1b) is a devastating genetic neurological disorder that preferentially affects specific regions of the brain. Typically, children born with PCH1b have structural defects in regions of the brain including those associated with key autonomic functions. Currently, there is no cure or treatment for the disease. PCH1b is caused by mutations in the RNA exosome component 3 (EXOSC3) gene, which encodes a structural component of the ubiquitous and essential multi-subunit RNA exosome complex. The RNA exosome is critical for both precise processing and turnover of multiple classes of RNAs. To elucidate the functional consequences of amino acid changes in EXOSC3 that cause PCH1b, we exploited well-established genetic approaches in Drosophila melanogaster that model EXOSC3 mutations found in individuals with PCH1b. Using this system, we find that the Drosophila EXOSC3 homolog (termed Rrp40) is essential for normal development and has an important function in neurons. Furthermore, PCH1b missense mutations modeled in Rrp40 cause reduced viability and produce neuronal-specific phenotypes that correlate with altered levels of target RNAs that encode factors with key roles in neurons. These results provide a basis for understanding how amino acid changes that occur in the RNA exosome contribute to neuronal dysfunction and disease.",

    "abstract": "Physiological homeostasis becomes compromised during aging, as a result of impairment of cellular processes, including transcription and RNA splicing. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to the loss of transcriptional fidelity are so far elusive, as are ways of preventing it. Here, we profiled and analyzed genome-wide, aging-related changes in transcriptional processes across different organisms: nematode worms, fruit flies, mice, rats and humans. The average transcriptional elongation speed (Pol-II speed) increased with age in all five species. Along with these changes in elongation speed we observed changes in splicing, including a reduction of unspliced transcripts and the formation of more circular RNAs. Two lifespan-extending interventions, dietary restriction and lowered insulin/Igf signaling, both reversed most of these aging-related changes. Genetic variants in Pol-II that reduced its speed in worms and flies increased their lifespan. Similarly, reducing Pol-II speed by overexpressing histone components, to counter age-associated changes in nucleosome positioning, also extended lifespan in flies and the division potential of human cells. Our findings uncover fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying animal aging and lifespan-extending interventions, and point to possible preventative measures.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionThe ability to detect and interpret third-party encounters (TPE) is one of the crucial skills enabling people to operate in the social world. Multiple lines of evidence converge towards the preferential processing of TPE when compared to the individual actions of multiple agents, even if the actions of agents were visually degraded to minimalistic point-light displays (PLDs). Here, we present a novel PLD dataset (Social Perception and Interaction Database; SoPID) that may be used for studying multiple levels of social information processing.\\n\\nMethodsDuring a motion-capture session, two pairs of actors were asked to perform a wide range of dyadic 3-second actions, including: (1) neutral, gesture-based communicative interactions (COM); (2) emotional exchanges (Happy/Angry); (3) synchronous physical activity of actors (SYNC); and (4) independent actions of agents, either object-related (ORA) or non-object related (NORA). The stimuli were then transformed into PLDs. Two validation studies (each with 20 healthy individuals) were then performed to establish the recognizability of the SoPID vignettes.\\n\\nResultsThe first study showed a ceiling level accuracy for discrimination of communicative vs. individual actions (93% +/- 5%) and high accuracy for interpreting specific types of actions (85 +/- 4%) from the SoPID. In the second study, a robust effect of scrambling on the recognizability of SoPID vignettes was observed in an independent sample of healthy individuals.\\n\\nDiscussionThese results suggest that the SoPID may be effectively used to examine processes associated with communicative interactions and intentions processing. The database can be accessed via Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/dcht8/).",

    "abstract": "Neural oscillations in auditory cortex are argued to support parsing and representing speech constituents at their corresponding temporal scales. Yet, how incoming sensory information interacts with ongoing spontaneous brain activity, what features of the neuronal microcircuitry underlie spontaneous and stimulus-evoked spectral fingerprints, and what these fingerprints entail for stimulus encoding, remain largely open questions. We used a combination of human invasive electrophysiology, computational modeling and decoding techniques to assess the information encoding properties of brain activity and to relate them to a plausible underlying neuronal microarchitecture. We analyzed intracortical auditory EEG activity from 10 patients while they were listening to short sentences. Pre-stimulus neural activity in early auditory cortical regions often exhibited power spectra with a shoulder in the delta range and a small bump in the beta range. Speech decreased power in the beta range, and increased power in the delta-theta and gamma ranges. Using multivariate machine learning techniques, we assessed the spectral profile of information content for two aspects of speech processing: detection and discrimination. We obtained better phase than power information decoding, and a bimodal spectral profile of information content with better decoding at low (delta-theta) and high (gamma) frequencies than at intermediate (beta) frequencies. These experimental data were reproduced by a simple rate model made of two subnetworks with different timescales, each composed of coupled excitatory and inhibitory units, and connected via a negative feedback loop. Modeling and experimental results were similar in terms of pre-stimulus spectral profile (except for the iEEG beta bump), spectral modulations with speech, and spectral profile of information content. Altogether, we provide converging evidence from both univariate spectral analysis and decoding approaches for a dual timescale processing infrastructure in human auditory cortex, and show that it is consistent with the dynamics of a simple rate model.\\n\\nAuthor summaryLike most animal vocalizations, speech results from a pseudo-rhythmic process that reflects the convergence of motor and auditory neural substrates and the natural resonance properties of the vocal apparatus towards efficient communication. Here, we leverage the excellent temporal and spatial resolution of intracranial EEG to demonstrate that neural activity in human early auditory cortical areas during speech perception exhibits a dual-scale spectral profile of power changes, with speech increasing power in low (delta-theta) and high (gamma - high-gamma) frequency ranges, while decreasing power in intermediate (alpha-beta) frequencies. Single-trial multivariate decoding also resulted in a bimodal spectral profile of information content, with better decoding at low and high frequencies than at intermediate ones. From both spectral and informational perspectives, these patterns are consistent with the activity of a relatively simple computational model comprising two reciprocally connected excitatory/inhibitory sub-networks operating at different (low and high) timescales. By combining experimental, decoding and modeling approaches, we provide consistent evidence for the existence, information coding value and underlying neuronal architecture of dual timescale processing in human auditory cortex.",

    "abstract": "Defects in flagella/cilia are often associated with infertility and disease. Motile male gametes (sperm cells) with flagella are an ancestral eukaryotic trait that has been lost in several lineages, for example in flowering plants. Here, we made use of a phenotypic male fertility difference between two moss (Physcomitrella patens) strains to explore spermatozoid function. We compare genetic and epigenetic variation as well as expression profiles between the Gransden and Reute strain to identify a set of genes associated with moss male infertility. Defects in mammal and algal homologs of these genes coincide with a loss of fertility, demonstrating the evolutionary conservation of flagellar function related to male fertility across kingdoms. As a proof of principle, we generated a loss-of-function mutant of a coiled-coil domain containing 39 (ccdc39) gene that is part of the flagellar hydin network. Indeed, the Ppccdc39 mutant resembles the male infertile Gransden strain phenotype. Potentially, several somatic (epi-)mutations occurred during prolonged vegetative propagation of P. patens Gransden, causing regulatory differences of e.g. the homeodomain transcription factor BELL1. Probably these somatic changes are causative for the observed male fertility. We propose that P. patens spermatozoids might be employed as an easily accessible system to study male infertility of human and animals.",

    "abstract": "How cells with different genetic makeups compete in tissues is an outstanding question in developmental biology and cancer research. Studies in recent years have revealed that cell competition can either be driven by short-range biochemical signalling or by long-range mechanical stresses in the tissue. To date, cell competition has generally been characterised at the population-scale, leaving the single-cell level mechanisms of competition elusive. Here, we use high time-resolution experimental data to construct a multi-scale agent-based model for epithelial cell competition, and use it to gain a conceptual understanding of the cellular factors that governs competition in cell populations within tissues. We find that a key determinant of mechanical competition is the difference in homeostatic density between winners and losers, while differences in growth rates and tissue organisation do not affect competition end-result. In contrast, the outcome and kinetics of biochemical competition is strongly influenced by local tissue organisation. Indeed, when loser cells are homogenously mixed with winners at the onset of competition, they are eradicated; however, when they are spatially separated, winner and loser cells coexist for long times. These findings suggest distinct biophysical origins for mechanical and biochemical modes of cell competition.",

    "abstract": "Inhibitory synaptic transmission plays a key role in the circuits underlying anxiety behaviors, but the network mechanisms by which disruptions in synaptic inhibition contribute to pathological anxiety processing remain largely unknown. Here we addressed this question in mice lacking the inhibitory synapse-specific adhesion protein Neuroligin-2 (Nlgn2), which display widespread reduction in inhibitory synaptic transmission as well as a pronounced anxiety phenotype. To investigate how the lack of synaptic inhibition alters the communication between key brain regions in anxiety processing, we recorded local field potentials (LFPs) simultaneously from a network of brain regions involved in anxiety processing, including the basolateral amygdala (BLA), centromedial amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampus (vHPC). We found that LFP power in the vHPC was profoundly increased while vHPC-directed theta frequency synchrony was disrupted in Nlgn2 KO mice under anxiogenic conditions. Instead, deletion of Nlgn2 increased beta frequency synchrony across the anxiety network, and the theta / beta synchrony ratio strongly predicted anxiety behaviors in an open field paradigm. Local deletion of Nlgn2 in the vHPC and BLA revealed that they encode distinct aspects of the anxiety phenotype of the Nlgn2 KO mice, with vHPC linked to anxiety induced freezing and BLA linked to reduction in exploratory activity. Together, our data demonstrate that alterations in long-range functional connectivity link synaptic inhibition to abnormal anxiety behaviors, and that Nlgn2 KO mice represent an interesting model to study the role of inhibitory synaptic transmission in the circuits underlying anxiety disorders.",

Here, we report the range expansion and first occurrence of the Japanese seahorse, Hippocampus mohnikei (Bleeker, 1853) from the Mandovi estuarine ecosystem of Goa, central west coast of India (CWCI) based on morpho-molecular analyses. The morphometric and meristic traits particularly, short snout (29-35% head length), double cheek spine, low coronet and long tail (51.2-57.9% of standard length), 11 trunk rings, 37-39 tail rings, 15-16 dorsal and 12-14 fin rays observed in four collected specimens matched with the reported key diagnostic morphological criteria of vouchered specimens of H. mohnikei. The seahorse mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and cytochrome b (Cyt b) genes were partially sequenced for conclusive genetic identification of the species under study. Molecular analysis showed that all four individuals of seahorse species clustered together suggesting a monophyletic lineage. Using the maximum similarity with GenBank database, maximum likelihood network and subsequent morphological analysis, the identity of the collected seahorse species was reconfirmed as H. mohnikei. With this new report, the geographic range of H. mohnikei extended significantly to the westward side from its previously known range. This new sighting of H. mohnikei could indicate a long-distance dispersal facilitated by due to prevailing oceanic circulation in the Indo-Pacific region or increased habitat suitability in bay-estuarine systems of Goa, CWCI. Comparison of the pair-wise genetic distances (Kimura 2-parameter) based on COI and Cyt b sequences revealed that the specimens examined in this study are genetically closer to H. mohnikei populations from Vietnam and Thailand than they are to those in Japan and China. To test the hypothesis whether H. mohnikei are vagrants or previously unreported established population, long-term inter-annual sampling and analyses are warranted.",

Then using a set of valid instrumental variables for birth weight, we performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to evaluate its causal effect on CKD based on summary association statistics available from large scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) (up to 143,677 individuals for birth weight and 118,147 individuals for CKD). We further validated the MR results with extensive sensitive analyses.\\n\\nResultsThe results of meta-analysis showed that individuals with low birth weight have about 76% (95% CI 36[~]126%) higher risk of CKD in late life compared with those with normal birth weight. Depending on 26 instrumental variables, the inverse variance weighted MR showed that the odds ratio per one SD increase of birth weight on CKD was estimated to be 0.91 (95% CI 0.72[~]1.14, p=0.396). The similar null association between birth weight and CKD is also observed using the weighted median method and maximum likelihood method as well as the Egger regression.

Here we extended these investigations by using selective optogenetic activation of each pathway in mice with channelrhodopsin 2 expression by double viral vector techniques. Brief photo-stimulation of the crossed pathway evoked short latency contraversive orienting-like head turns, while extended stimulation induced contraversive circling responses. In contrast, stimulation of uncrossed pathway induced short-latency upward head movements followed by longer-latency defense-like behaviors including retreat and flight. The novel discovery was that the evoked defense-like responses varied depending on the environment, suggesting that uncrossed output can be influenced by top-down modification of the SC or its downstream. This further suggests that the SCd-defense system can be profoundly modulated by non-motor, affective and cognitive components, in addition to direct sensory inputs.",

To further study the basis for this phenomenon we use theoretically motivated fixed-order Auto-Regressive Moving-Average (ARMA) time series modelling to study the oscillatory dynamics of spontaneous alpha-band electroencephalographic activity in eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions and its modulation by the NMDA antagonist ketamine. We find that the reduction in alpha-band power between eyes-closed and eyes-open states is explicable in terms of an increase in the damping of stochastically perturbed alpha-band relaxation oscillatory activity. These changes in damping are putatively modified by the antagonism of NMDA-mediated glutamatergic neurotransmission but are not directly driven by changes in input to cortex nor by reductions in the phase synchronisation of populations of near identical oscillators. These results not only provide a direct challenge to the dominant view of the role that thalamus and neuronal population de-/synchronisation have in the genesis and modulation of alpha electro-/magnetoencephalographic activity but also suggest potentially important physiological determinants underlying its dynamical control and regulation.",

To study the molecular mechanism of xa5 function in BLS resistance, we created transgenic lines with RNAi of Xa5 (LOC_Os05g01710) and used RNA-seq to analyze the transcriptomes of a Xa5-RNAi line and the wild-type line at 9 h after inoculation with Xoc, with the mock inoculation with water as control. The results showed that Xa5-RNAi could (1) increase the resistance to BLS as expected from xa5; (2) alter (mainly up-regulate) the expression of hundreds of genes, most of which were related to disease resistance; and (3) greatly enhance the response of thousands of genes to Xoc infection, especially of the genes involved in cell death pathways, suggesting that xa5 displays BLS resistance effect probably mainly because of the enhanced response of the cell death-related genes to Xoc infection.",

    "abstract": "The ability to climb with adhesive pads conveys significant advantages, and is hence widespread in the animal kingdom. The physics of adhesion predict that attachment is more challenging for large animals, whereas detachment is harder for small animals, due to the difference in surface-to-volume ratios. Here, we use stick insects to show that this problem is solved at both ends of the scale by linking adhesion to the applied shear force. Adhesive forces of individual insect pads, measured with perpendicular pull-offs, increased approximately in proportion to a linear pad dimension across instars. In sharp contrast, whole-body force measurements suggested area-scaling of adhesion. This discrepancy is explained by the presence of shear forces during whole-body measurements, as confirmed in experiments with pads sheared prior to detachment. When we applied shear forces proportional to either pad area or body weight, pad adhesion also scaled approximately with area or mass, respectively, providing a mechanism that can compensate for the size-related loss of adhesive performance predicted by isometry. We demonstrate that the adhesion-enhancing effect of shear forces is linked to pad sliding, which increased the maximum adhesive force per area sustainable by the pads. As shear forces in natural conditions are expected to scale with mass, sliding is more frequent and extensive in large animals, thus ensuring that large animals can attach safely, while small animals can still detach their pads effortlessly. Our results therefore help to explain how natures climbers maintain a dynamic attachment performance across seven orders of magnitude in body weight.",

    "abstract": "Carotenoid coloration is widely recognized as a signal of individual condition in various animals, but despite decades of study, the mechanisms that link carotenoid coloration to condition remain unresolved. Most birds with red feathers convert yellow dietary carotenoids to red carotenoids in an oxidation process requiring the gene encoding the putative cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2J19. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the process of carotenoid oxidation and feather pigmentation is functionally linked to mitochondrial performance. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed high levels of red ketolated carotenoids associated with the hepatic mitochondria of molting wild house finches (Haemorhous mexicanus), and upon fractionation, we found the highest concentration of ketolated carotenoids in the inner mitochondrial membrane. We further found that the redness of growing feathers was positively related to the performance of liver mitochondria. Structural modeling of CYP2J19 supports a direct role of this protein in carotenoid ketolation that may be functionally linked to cellular respiration. These observations suggest that feather coloration serves as a signal of core functionality through inexorable links to cellular respiration in the mitochondria.",

    "abstract": "In pursuit of effective therapeutics for human polyomaviruses, we identified a peptide derived from the BK polyomavirus (BKV) minor structural proteins VP2/3 that is a potent inhibitor of BKV infection with no observable cellular toxicity. The thirteen amino acid peptide binds to major structural protein VP1 in a new location within the pore with a low nanomolar KD. Alanine scanning of the peptide identified three key residues, substitution of each of which results in [~]1000-fold loss of affinity with a concomitant reduction in antiviral activity. NMR spectroscopy and an X-ray structurally-guided model demonstrate specific binding of the peptide to the pore of the VP1 pentamer that constitutes the BKV capsid. Cell-based assays with the peptide demonstrate nanomolar inhibition of BKV infection and suggest that the peptide likely blocks the viral entry pathway between endocytosis and escape from the host cell ER. The peptide motif is highly conserved among the polyomavirus clade, and homologous peptides exhibit similar binding properties for JC polyomavirus and inhibit infection with similar potency to BKV in a model cell line. Substitutions within VP1 or VP2/3 residues involved in VP1-peptide interaction negatively impact viral infectivity, potentially indicating the peptide-binding site within the VP1 pore is relevant for VP1-VP2/3 interactions. The inhibitory potential of the peptide-binding site first reported here may present a novel target for development of new anti-polyomavirus therapies. In summary, we present the first anti-polyomavirus inhibitor that acts via a novel mechanism of action by specifically targeting the pore of VP1.",

    "abstract": "Measuring and quantifying thermodynamic parameters that determine stability of and interactions between biological macromolecules is an essential and necessary complement to structural studies. Although several laboratories are able to obtain basic thermodynamic parameters for the observed process, the data interpretation and analysis quality of reported data can be extremely tedious. We have started to develop a web application that will help users to perform thermodynamic characterization of G-quadruplex unfolding. The application can perform global fitting of calorimetric and spectroscopic data, and it uses a three-state equilibrium model to obtain thermodynamic parameters for each transition step: the Gibbs energy, the enthalpy, and the heat capacity. As well as these, the application can define the number of K+ ions and the number of water molecules being released or taken up during the unfolding. To test our application, we used UV spectroscopy, circular dichroism, and differential scanning calorimetry, to monitor folding and unfolding of a model 22-nucleotide-long sequence of human 3-telomeric overhang, known as Tel22. The obtained data was fed to the web application and global fit revealed that unfolding of Tel22 involves at least one intermediate state, and that K+ ions are released during the unfolding, whereas water molecules are taken up.\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEThe laws of thermodynamics provide tools for the use of elegant mathematical expressions to describe stabilities and interactions of biological macromolecule. Even though thermodynamic profiles of simple transitions (e.g., two state) can be obtained in a relatively straightforward manner, performing thermodynamic analysis of complex/ multistep transitions or global analysis of several experimental data requires some experiences and skills. In the present study we are demonstrating how newly developed web application can be used to provide better understanding of driving forces responsible for the structural interconversion of G-quadruplex structures. We have tested this web application with experimental data obtained from monitoring thermal folding/ unfolding of the 5-AG3T2AG3T2AG3T2AG3-3 (Tel22) DNA sequence. We believe that this application can be used as a research and/or teaching tool, and it will allow comparisons of the thermodynamic parameters obtained between different laboratories.",

    "abstract": "The cytoskeleton is regulated by dynamic, multi-layered signaling networks that interconnect Rho family small GTPases with exquisite spatiotemporal precision1. Understanding the organization of these networks is challenging, as protein activation and interaction occur transiently and with precise subcellular localization. We and others have used fluorescent biosensors in living cells to map the activation patterns of the Rho family small GTPases relative to the changes in cell edge dynamics that they produce2-4. These GTPases are controlled by the localized activity of numerous Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) with overlapping GTPase specificity5,6. Here we extend this analysis to determine functional relationships between GEFs and GTPases in controlling cell edge movements. First, biosensors for GEF activation are produced, and their activity correlated with edge dynamics. We then shift the wavelengths of GTPase biosensors to image and correlate the activation of GEFs and GTPases in the same cell. Using partial correlation analysis, we can parse out from such multiplexed data the contribution of each GEF - GTPase interaction to edge dynamics, i.e. we identify when and where specific GEF activation events regulate specific downstream GTPases to affect motility. We describe biosensors for eight Dbl family RhoGEFs based on a broadly applicable new design strategy (Asef, Tiam1, Vav isoforms, Tim, LARG, and {beta}-Pix), and red shifted biosensors for RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42. In the context of motility, functional interactions were identified for Asef regulation of Cdc42 and Rac1. This approach exemplifies a powerful means to elucidate the real-time connectivity of signal transduction networks.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the genomic basis of adaptation to different abiotic environments is important for understanding organismal responses to current short-term environmental fluctuations. Using functional and comparative genomics approaches, we here investigated whether genomic adaptation to a set of environmental parameters is contingent across vertebrate genomes or, alternatively, contains an element of evolutionary constraint that would be evident through recurrent involvement of specific subsets of genes and functions in adaptation to similar environments. We first identified 200 genes with signatures of selection from transcriptomes of 24 species of lacertid lizards with known adaptations in preferred temperature, correlated with thermal environment experienced by these lizards in their range. In order to discern genes adapting to climate from other selective factors, we then performed a meta-analysis of 1100 genes with signatures of selection obtained from-omics studies in vertebrate species adapted to different abiotic environments. We found that this gene set formed a tightly connected interactome which was to 23% enriched in predicted functions of adaptation to climate and to 18% involved in organismal stress response. We found a much higher degree of recurrent use of identical genes (43.6%) and functional similarity than expected by chance, and no clear division between genes used in ectotherm and endotherm physiological strategies. 171 out of 200 genes of Lacertidae were part of this network, indicating that a comparative genomic approach can help to disentangle genes functionally related to adaptation to different abiotic environments from other selective factors. These results furthermore highlight an important role of genomic constraint in adaptation to the abiotic environment, and narrows the set of candidate markers to be used in future research on environmental adaptability related to climate change.\\n\\nSignificance Statement / Nontechnical summaryWhile the convergent evolution of phenotypes in similar environments is a well-studied phenomenon, the genomic basis of such common phenotypes and physiologies is still enigmatic. The prevalent notion is that re-use of the same genes to adapt to similar environments in different species is about as likely as winning the lottery - but organismal systems are also, to some extent, comparable between different species such as man and fruit fly through shared genes and gene functions. In this paper, we test whether constraint or contingency is more prevalent in genomic adaptation of vertebrates to aspects of their abiotic environment. We find evidence for strong functional constraint and stress responsiveness of the genes involved, which might help understand how currently experienced stress under changing climates may result in future adaptation.",

    "abstract": "The HIV-1 envelope protein (Env) is the target of neutralizing antibodies and the template for vaccine immunogen design. The dynamic conformational equilibrium of trimeric Env influences its antigenicity and potential immunogenicity. Antibodies that bind at the trimer apex stabilize a \\\"closed\\\" conformation characteristic of the most difficult to neutralize isolates. A goal of vaccine development is therefore to mimic the closed conformation in a designed immunogen. A disulfide-stabilized, trimeric Env ectodomain -- the \\\"SOSIP\\\" construct -- has many of the relevant properties; it is also particularly suitable for structure determination. Some single-molecule studies have, however, suggested that the SOSIP trimer is not a good representation of Env on the surface of a virion or an infected cell. We isolated Env (fully cleaved to gp120 and gp41) from the surface of expressing cells using tagged, apex-binding Fab PG16 and determined the structure of the PG16-Env complex by cryo-EM to an overall resolution of 4.6 [A]. Placing the only purification tag on the Fab ensured that the isolated Env was continuously stabilized in its closed, native conformation. The Env structure in this complex corresponds closely to the SOSIP structures determined by both x-ray crystallography and cryo-EM. Although the membrane-interacting elements are not resolved in our reconstruction, we can make inferences about the connection between ectodomain and membrane-proximal external region (MPER) by reference to the published cryo-tomography structure of an Env \\\"spike\\\" and the NMR structure of the MPER-transmembrane segment. We discuss these results in view of the conflicting interpretations in the literature.",

    "abstract": "To move the body, the brain must precisely coordinate patterns of activity among diverse populations of motor neurons. In many species, including vertebrates, the motor neurons innervating a given muscle fire in a specific order that is determined by a gradient of cellular size and electrical excitability. This hierarchy allows premotor circuits to recruit motor neurons of increasing force capacity in a task-dependent manner. However, it remains unclear whether such a size principle also applies to species with more compact motor systems, such as the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, which has just 53 motor neurons per leg. Using in vivo calcium imaging and electrophysiology, we found that genetically-identified motor neurons controlling flexion of the fly tibia exhibit a gradient of anatomical, physiological, and functional properties consistent with the size principle. Large, fast motor neurons control high force, ballistic movements while small, slow motor neurons control low force, postural movements. Intermediate neurons fall between these two extremes. In behaving flies, motor neurons are recruited in order from slow to fast. This hierarchical organization suggests that slow and fast motor neurons control distinct motor regimes. Indeed, we find that optogenetic manipulation of each motor neuron type has distinct effects on the behavior of walking flies.",

    "abstract": "Mapping the structural and functional brain connectivity fingerprints became an essential approach in neurology and experimental neuroscience because network properties can underlie behavioral phenotypes. In mouse models, revealing strain related patterns of brain wiring have a tremendous importance, since these animals are used to answer questions related to neurological or neuropsychiatric disorders. C57BL/6 and BALB/cJ inbred strains are primary \\\"genetic backgrounds\\\" for brain disease modelling and for testing therapeutic approaches. Nevertheless, extensive literature describes basal differences in the behavioral, neuroanatomical and neurochemical profiles of the two strains, which raises the question whether the observed effects are pathology specific or depend on the genetic background. Here we performed a systematic comparative exploration of brain structure and function of C57BL/6 and BALB/cJ mice via Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We combined voxel-based morphometry (VBM), diffusion MRI and high resolution fiber mapping (hrFM) and resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and depicted brain-wide dissimilarities in the morphology and \\\"connectome\\\" features in the two strains. Particularly C57BL/6 animals show bigger and denser frontal cortical areas, cortico-striatal tracts and thalamic and midbrain pathways, and higher density of fibers in the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum. These features are fairly reflected in the functional connectograms that emphasize differences in \\\"hubness\\\", frontal cortical and basal forbrain connectivity. We demonstrate strongly divergent reward-aversion circuitry patterns and some variations of the default mode network features. Inter-hemispherical functional connectivity showed flexibility and adjustment regarding the structural patterns in a strain specific manner. We further provide high-resolution tractograms illustrating also inter-individual variability across inter-hemispherical callosal pathways in the BALB/cJ strain.",

Specifically, over 25% of the hippocampal transcriptome displayed changes in their poly(A) tail in mouse models of epilepsy, particular evident in the chronic phase. The expression of cytoplasmic polyadenylation binding proteins (CPEB1-4) was found to be altered in the hippocampus in mouse models of epilepsy and temporal lobe epilepsy patients and CPEB4 target transcripts were over-represented among those showing poly(A) tail changes. Supporting an adaptive function, CPEB4-deficiency leads to an increase in seizure severity and neurodegeneration in mouse models of epilepsy. Together, these findings reveal an additional layer of gene expression control during epilepsy and point to novel targets for seizure control and disease-modification in epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "Age-at-onset is one of the critical phenotypes in cohort studies of age-related diseases. Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of age-at-onset can provide more insights into genetic effects on disease progression, and transitions between different stages. Moreover, proportional hazards or Cox regression generally achieves higher statistical power in a cohort study than a binary trait using logistic regression. Although mixed-effects models are widely used in GWAS to correct for population stratification and family structure, application of Cox mixed-effects models (CMEMs) to large-scale GWAS are so far hindered by intractable computational intensity. In this work, we propose COXMEG, an efficient R package for conducting GWAS of age-at-onset using CMEMs. COXMEG introduces fast estimation algorithms for general sparse relatedness matrices including but not limited to block-diagonal pedigree-based matrices. COXMEG also introduces a fast and powerful score test for fully dense relatedness matrices, accounting for both population stratification and family structure. In addition, COXMEG handles positive semidefinite relatedness matrices, which are common in twin and family studies. Our simulation studies suggest that COXMEG, depending on the structure of the relatedness matrix, is 100[~]100,000-fold computationally more efficient for GWAS than coxme for a sample consisting of 1000-10,000 individuals. We found that using sparse approximation of relatedness matrices yielded highly comparable performance in controlling false positives and statistical power for an ethnically homogeneous family-based sample. When applying COXMEG to a NIA-LOADFS sample with 3456 Caucasians, we identified the APOE4 variant with strong statistical power (p=1e-101), far more significant than previous studies using a transformed variable and a marginal Cox model. When investigating a multi-ethnic NIA-LOADFS sample including 3456 Caucasians and 287 African Americans, we identified a novel SNP rs36051450 (p=2e-9) near GRAMD1B, the minor allele of which significantly reduced the hazards of AD in both genders. Our results demonstrated that COXMEG greatly facilitates the application of CMEMs in GWAS of age-at-onset phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Prostate cancers are considered immunologically  cold tumors given the very few patients who respond to checkpoint inhibitor therapy (CPI). Recently, enrichment of interferon (IFN) response genes predicts a favorable response to CPI across various disease sites. The enhancer of zeste homolog-2 (EZH2) is over-expressed in prostate cancer and is known to negatively regulate IFN response genes. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of EZH2 catalytic activity in prostate cancer models derepresses expression of double-strand RNA (dsRNA), associated with upregulation of genes involved in antigen presentation, Th-1 chemokine signaling, and interferon (IFN) response, including PD-L1. Similarly, application of a novel EZH2 derived gene signature to human prostate sample analysis indicated an inverse correlation between tumor EZH2 activity/expression with T-cell inflamed and IFN gene signatures and PD-L1 expression. EZH2 inhibition combined with PD-1 CPI significantly enhances antitumor response that is dependent on up-regulation of tumor PD-L1 expression. Further, combination therapy significantly increases intratumoral trafficking of activated CD8+ T-cells and M1 tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) with concurrent loss of M2 TAMs. Our study identifies EZH2 as a potent inhibitor of antitumor immunity and responsiveness to CPI. This data suggests EZH2 inhibition as a novel therapeutic direction to enhance prostate cancer response to PD-1 CPI.",

    "abstract": "The activity and potency of a drug is inherently affected by the metabolic state of its target cell. Solute Carriers (SLCs) represent the largest family of transmembrane transporters in humans and constitute major determinants of cellular metabolism. Several SLCs have been shown to be required for the uptake of individual chemical compounds into cellular systems, but systematic surveys of transporter-drug relationships in human cells are currently lacking. We performed a series of genetic screens in the haploid human cell line HAP1 using a set of 60 cytotoxic compounds representative of the chemical space populated by approved drugs. By using a SLC-focused CRISPR/Cas9 lentiviral library, we identified transporters whose absence induced resistance to the drugs tested. Among the hundreds of drug-SLC relationships identified, we confirmed the role of the folate transporter SLC19A1 on the activity of antifolates and of SLC29A1 on several nucleoside analogs. Among the newly discovered dependencies, we identified the transporters SLC11A2/SLC16A1 for artemisinin derivatives and SLC35A2/SLC38A5 for cisplatin. The functional dependence on SLCs observed for a significant proportion of the compounds screened suggested a widespread role for SLCs in the uptake and cellular activity of cytotoxic drugs and provided an experimentally validated set of SLC-drug associations for a number of clinically relevant compounds.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary transitions to a social lifestyle in insects are associated with lineage-specific changes in gene expression, but the key nodes that drive these regulatory changes are unknown. We examined the relationship between social organization and lineage-specific microRNAs (miRNAs). Genome scans across 12 bee species showed that miRNA copy-number is mostly conserved and not associated with sociality. However, deep sequencing of small RNAs in six bee species revealed a substantial proportion (20-35%) of detected miRNAs had lineage-specific expression in the brain, 24-72% of which did not have homologs in other species. Lineage-specific miRNAs disproportionately target lineage-specific genes, and have lower expression levels than shared miRNAs. The predicted targets of lineage-specific miRNAs are not enriched for genes with caste-biased expression or genes under positive selection in social species. Together, these results suggest that novel miRNAs may coevolve with novel genes, and thus contribute to lineage-specific patterns of evolution in bees, but do not appear to have significant influence on social evolution. Our analyses also support the hypothesis that many new miRNAs are purged by selection due to deleterious effects on mRNA targets, and suggest genome structure is not as influential in regulating bee miRNA evolution as has been shown for mammalian miRNAs.",

    "abstract": "We present a flexible, open source R package designed to obtain additional biological and epidemiological insights from commonly available serological datasets. Analysis of serological responses against pathogens with multiple strains such as influenza pose a specific statistical challenge because observed antibody responses measured in serological assays depend both on unobserved prior infections and the resulting cross-reactive antibody dynamics that these infections generate. We provide a general modelling framework to jointly infer these two typically confounded biological processes using antibody titres against current and historical strains. We do this by linking latent infection dynamics with a mechanistic model of antibody dynamics that generates expected antibody titres over time. This makes it possible to use observations of antibodies in serological assays to infer an individuals infection history as well as the parameters of the antibody process model. Our aim is to provide a flexible inference package that can be applied to a range of datasets studying different viruses over different timescales. We present two case studies to illustrate how our model can infer key immunological parameters, such as antibody titre boosting, waning and cross-reaction, and well as latent epidemiological processes such as attack rates and age-stratified infection risk.",

Along this direction, individuals tend to have more positive and less negative behavioral/demographic traits, and more importantly, their functional connectivity and cortical thickness show a similar divergent modulation across the cortical hierarchy: thinner cortex and stronger functional connectivity at the higher-order cognitive regions whereas thicker cortex and weaker connectivity at the lower-order sensory/motor areas. These findings provide a unique link between structural and functional brain organizations and human behavior. Specifically, they suggest that the cross-hierarchy contrast of structural and functional brain measures may be a specific feature linked to the overall goodness of behavior and demographics.",

However, the exact mechanisms by which osteocytes relay mechanical signals to effector cells is poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that osteocytes subjected to a physiologic fluid shear secrete a distinct collection of factors that significantly enhance human MSC recruitment and osteogenesis. Utilising proteomics we generated an extensive map of proteins within the mechanically activated osteocyte secretome, identifying numerous paracrine factors that are modified by mechanical stimulation. Moreover, we identified the presence of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and further demonstrated that these mechanically activated osteocyte derived EVs (MAEVs) coordinate human MSCs recruitment and osteogenesis. This indicates that mechanical conditioning of parent cells can modify EVs and demonstrates the pro-osteogenic potential of MAEVs as a cell-free therapy to enhance bone regeneration and repair in diseases such as osteoporosis.",

    "abstract": "To enter into mitosis, cells must shut off the cell cycle inhibitor Wee1. SAD family protein kinases regulate Wee1 signaling in yeast and humans. In S. pombe, two SAD kinases (Cdr1/Nim1 and Cdr2) act as upstream inhibitors of Wee1. Previous studies found that S. pombe Cdr1/Nim1 directly phosphorylates and inhibits Wee1 in vitro, but different results were obtained for budding yeast and human SAD kinases. Without a full understanding of Cdr1 action on Wee1, it has been difficult to assess the in vivo relevance and conservation of this mechanism. Here, we show that both Cdr1 and Cdr2 promote Wee1 phosphorylation in cells, but only Cdr1 inhibits Wee1 kinase activity. Inhibition occurs when Cdr1 phosphorylates a cluster of serine residues linking -helices G and H of the Wee1 kinase domain. This region is highly divergent among different Wee1 proteins, consistent with distinct regulatory mechanisms. A wee(4A) mutant that impairs phosphorylation by Cdr1 delays mitotic entry and causes elongated cells. By disrupting and re-targeting Cdr1 localization, we show that Cdr1 inhibition of Wee1 occurs in cells at cortical nodes formed by Cdr2. Based on our results, we propose a two-step model for inhibition of Wee1 by Cdr1 and Cdr2 at nodes.",

The authors reported that DNAm level of the TNF-alpha decreases along with aging in blood and glia, but not in neuron; however, DNAm differences between delirium cases and non-delirium controls have not been investigated directly. Therefore, in the present study, DNAm differences in blood between delirium patients and controls without delirium were examined.\\n\\nMethodsA case-control study with 92 subjects was conducted. Whole blood samples were collected and genome-wide DNAm was measured by the Infinium HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip arrays. The correlation between DNAm levels in the TNF-alpha and age, network analysis, and the correlation between age and DNAm age were tested.\\n\\nResultsOnly delirium cases showed 3 CpGs sites in the TNF-alpha significantly correlated to age after multiple corrections. A genome-wide significant CpG site near the gene of LDLRAD4 was identified. In addition, network analysis showed several significant pathways with false discovery rate adjusted p-value < 0.05. The top pathway with GO was immune response, and the second top pathway with KEGG was cholinergic synapse.

    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs support multiple research efforts by providing contextual information for biomedical entities, constructing networks, and supporting the interpretation of high-throughput analyses. These databases are populated via some form of manual curation, which is difficult to scale in the context of an increasing publication rate. Data programming is a paradigm that circumvents this arduous manual process by combining databases with simple rules and heuristics written as label functions, which are programs designed to automatically annotate textual data. Unfortunately, writing a useful label function requires substantial error analysis and is a nontrivial task that takes multiple days per function. This makes populating a knowledge graph with multiple nodes and edge types practically infeasible. We sought to accelerate the label function creation process by evaluating the extent to which label functions could be re-used across multiple edge types. We used a subset of an existing knowledge graph centered on disease, compound, and gene entities to evaluate label function re-use. We determined the best label function combination by comparing a baseline database-only model with the same model but added edge-specific or edge-mismatch label functions. We confirmed that adding additional edge-specific rather than edge-mismatch label functions often improves text annotation and shows that this approach can incorporate novel edges into our source knowledge graph. We expect that continued development of this strategy has the potential to swiftly populate knowledge graphs with new discoveries, ensuring that these resources include cutting-edge results.",

    "abstract": "In disturbance ecology, stability is composed of resistance to change and resilience towards recovery after the disturbance subsides. Two key microbial mechanisms that can support microbiome stability include dormancy and dispersal. Specifically, microbial populations that are sensitive to disturbance can be re-seeded by local dormant pools of viable and reactivated cells, or by immigrants dispersed from regional metacommunities. However, it is difficult to quantify the contributions of these mechanisms to stability without, first, distinguishing the active from inactive membership, and, second, distinguishing the populations recovered by local resuscitation from those recovered by dispersed immigrants. Here, we investigate the contributions of dormancy dynamics (activation and inactivation), and dispersal to soil microbial community resistance and resilience. We designed a replicated, 45-week time-series experiment to quantify the responses of the active soil microbial community to a thermal press disturbance, including control mesocosms, disturbed mesocosms without dispersal, and disturbed mesocosms with dispersal after the release of the stressor. Communities were sensitive within one week of warming. Though the disturbed mesocosms did not fully recover within 29 weeks, resuscitation of thermotolerant taxa was key for community transition during the press, and both resuscitation of opportunistic taxa and immigration contributed to community resilience. Also, mesocosms with dispersal were more resilient than mesocosms without. This work advances the mechanistic understanding of how microbiomes respond to disturbances in their environment.",

Here, we systematically compared antibiotic responses in gnotobiotic and conventional mice across antibiotics, microbiotas, diets, and housing status. We identify remarkable resilience, whereby a humanized microbiota recovers before drug administration ends, with transient dominance of resistant Bacteroides and taxa-asymmetric reduction in diversity. In other cases, in vitro sensitivities were not predictive of in vivo responses, underscoring the significance of host and community contexts. A fiber-deficient diet exacerbated collapse of the microbiota and delayed recovery, despite the presence of a similar core community across diets at the point of maximal disturbance. Resilience to a second ciprofloxacin treatment was observed via response reprogramming, in which species replacement after ciprofloxacin treatment established resilience to a second treatment, and also through cross housing transmission. Single-housing drastically disrupted recovery, highlighting the importance of environmental microbial reservoirs and suggesting sanitation may exacerbate the duration of antibiotic-mediated disruption. Our findings highlight the ability of the commensal microbiota to deterministically adapt to large perturbations, and the translational potential for modulating diet, sanitation, and microbiota composition during antibiotics.",

For measuring the general activity from a majority of neurons within neocortical and hippocampal human ex vivo slices we used a microelectrode array (MEA) recording technique with 252 electrodes covering an area of 3.2 x 3.2 mm2 and a second CMOS-based MEA with 4225 electrodes on a 2 x 2 mm2 area for detailed mapping of action potential waveforms. We found that hCSF increase the number of active neurons and the firing rate of the neurons in the slices as well as increasing the numbers of bursts while leaving the duration of the bursts unchanged. Interestingly, not only an increase in the overall activity in the slices was observed, but a reconfiguration of the network functionality could be detected with specific activation and inactivation of subpopulations of neuronal ensembles. In conclusion, hCSF is an important component to consider for future human tissue studies, especially for experiments designed to mimic the in vivo situation.",

The integration of neuroimaging characteristics and genetics data allows a better understanding of the effects of the genetic variations on brain structural and functional connections. The current work uses whole-brain tractography in a longitudinal setting, and by measuring the brain structural connectivity changes studies the neurodegeneration of Alzheimers disease. This is accomplished by examining the effect of targeted genetic risk factors on the most common local and global brain connectivity measures. Furthermore, we examined the extent to which Clinical Dementia Rating relates to brain connections longitudinally, as well as to gene expression. Here we show that the expression of PLAU gene increases the change over time in betweenness centrality related to the fusiform gyrus. We also show that the betweenness centrality metric impact dementia-related changes in distinct brain regions. Our findings provide insights into the complex longitudinal interplay between genetics and brain characteristics and highlight the role of Alzheimers genetic risk factors in the estimation of regional brain connectivity alterations.",

    "abstract": "Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) A and B are highly ubiquitous betaherpesviruses, infecting the majority of the human population. Like other herpesviruses, they encompass large genomes and our understanding of their protein coding potential is far from complete. Here we employ ribosome profiling and systematic transcript analysis to experimentally define the HHV-6 translation products and to follow their temporal expression. We identify hundreds of new open reading frames (ORFs), including many upstream ORFs (uORFs) and internal ORFs (iORFs), generating a complete unbiased atlas of HHV-6 proteome. Furthermore, by integrating systematic data from the prototypic betaherpesvirus, human cytomegalovirus, we uncover numerous uORFs and iORFs that are conserved across betaherpesviruses and we show that uORFs are specifically enriched in late viral genes. Using our transcriptome measurements, we identified three highly abundant HHV-6 encoded long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), one of which generates a non-polyadenylated stable intron that appears to be a conserved feature of betaherpesviruses. Overall, our work reveals the complexity of HHV-6 genomes and highlights novel features that are conserved between betaherpesviruses, providing a rich resource for future functional studies.",

    "abstract": "The sense of direction requires accurate tracking of head direction at different turning-velocities, yet it remains unclear how this is achieved in the mammalian brain. Here we recorded head-direction cells in bat dorsal presubiculum and found that, surprisingly, the head-direction signal in this cortical region was dynamically controlled by angular velocity. In most neurons, a sharp head-direction tuning emerged at some angular velocity, but was absent at other velocities - resulting in a 4-fold increase in head-direction cell abundance. The head-direction tuning changed as a function of angular velocity primarily via a redistribution of spikes between the neurons preferred and null directions - while keeping the average firing-rate constant. These results could not be explained by existing  ring-attractor models of the head-direction system. We propose a novel recurrent network model that accounts for the observed dynamics of head-direction cells. This model predicts that the new classes of cells we found can improve the sensitivity of the head-direction system to directional sensory cues, and support angular-velocity integration.",

Therefore, it is valuable to develop a data augmentation method that can generate high-quality synthetic samples to further improve the accuracy of prediction methods. In this work, we propose a novel generative adversarial networks-based method, namely FFPred-GAN, to accurately learn the high-dimensional distributions of protein sequence-based biophysical features and also generate high-quality synthetic protein feature samples.

    "abstract": "The development of the gut from endodermal tissue to an organ with multiple distinct structures and functions occurs over a prolonged time during embryonic days E10.5-E14.5 in the mouse. During this process, one major event is innervation of the gut by enteric neural crest cells (ENCC) to establish the enteric nervous system (ENS). To understand the molecular processes underpinning gut and ENS development, we generated RNA-seq profiles from wildtype mouse guts at E10.5, E12.5 and E14.5 from both sexes. We also generated these profiles from homozygous Ret null embryos, a model for Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), in whom the ENS is absent. These data reveal four major features: (1) between E10.5 to E14.5 the developmental genetic programs change from expression of major transcription factors (TF) and its modifiers to genes controlling tissue (epithelium, muscle, endothelium) specialization; (2) the major effect of Ret is not only on ENCC differentiation to enteric neurons but also on the enteric mesenchyme and epithelium; (3) a muscle genetic program exerts significant effects on ENS development, and (4) sex differences in gut development profiles are minor. The genetic programs identified, and their changes across development, suggests that both cell autonomous and non-autonomous factors, and interactions between the different developing gut tissues, are important for normal ENS development and its disorders.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe mammalian gut is a complex set of tissues formed during development by orchestrating the timing of expression of many genes. Here we uncover the identity of these genes, their pathways and how they change during gut organogenesis. We used RNA-seq profiling in the wildtype mouse gut in both sexes during development (E10.5 - E14.5), as well as in a Ret null mouse, a model of Hirschsprung disease (HSCR). These studies have allowed us to expand the universe of genes and developmental processes that contribute to enteric neuronal innervation and to its dysregulation in disease.",

    "abstract": "With the rising rates of obesity and associated metabolic disorders, there is a growing need for effective long-term weight loss strategies, coupled with an understanding of how they interface with host physiology. While diet is a critical and promising area of focus, it has been difficult to identify diets that are broadly effective in long-term weight management. To explore the interaction between specific diets and bacteria within the gut, we tracked microbiota composition over a 12-month period as part of a larger dietary intervention study of participants consuming either a low-carbohydrate or low-fat diet. While baseline microbiota composition was not predictive of weight loss, each diet resulted in substantial changes in the microbiota three months after the start of the intervention; some of these changes were diet-specific and others tracked with weight loss. After these initial shifts, the microbiota returned near its original baseline state for the remainder of the intervention, despite participants maintaining their diet and weight loss for the entire study. These results suggest a resilience to perturbation of the microbiomes starting state. When considering the established contribution of obese-associated microbiotas to weight gain in animal models, microbiota resilience may need to be overcome for long-term alterations to host physiology.",

Twelve Karakul sheep were assigned randomly to four dietary treatments of NFC/NDF (0.78, 1.23, 1.61 and 2.00 respectively) as group 1, 2, 3 to 4. The experiment lasted for four periods, period I (1~18 d), II (19~36 d), III (37~54 d) and IV (55~72 d). Ruminal digesta were collected consecutively for three days to measure pH and bacteria per period. The results indicated that the average ruminal pH and amounts of OTUs were decreased with the increase of dietary NFC/NDF for four periods. At phylum level, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the predominant bacteria of four periods, Bacteroidetes were decreased, while the relative abundance of Firmicutes was increased with dietary NFC/NDF for four periods, but the difference wasnt significant (P>0.05).

    "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) continues to pose a serious public health risk and is one of the major causes of chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. Current antiviral therapy does not effectively eradicate HBV and, thus, further investigation into the mechanisms employed by HBV to allow for invasion of host cells, is critical for the development of novel therapeutic agents. Sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) has been identified as a functional receptor for HBV. However, the specific mechanism by which HBV and NTCP interact remains unclear. Herein we show that the expression of E-cadherin was upregulated in cells expressing HBV, while knockdown of E-cadherin in HepG2-NTCP cells, HepaRG cells and primary human hepatocytes served to significantly inhibit infection by HBV and HBV pseudotyped particles. Alternatively, exogenous E-cadherin expression was found to significantly enhance HBV uptake by HepaRG cells. Further, mechanistic studies identified glycosylated NTCP localized to the cell membrane via E-cadherin binding, which subsequently allowed for more efficient binding between NTCP and the preS1 of the large HBV surface proteins. E-cadherin was also found to play a key role in establishing and maintaining hepatocyte polarity, which is essential for efficient HBV infection. These observations suggest that E-cadherin facilitates HBV entry through regulation of NTCP distribution and hepatocyte polarity.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryHepatitis B Virus (HBV) still seriously endangers public health. It is very important to understand the mechanism of HBV invading host cells for developing new therapy target. Sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) is the key receptor mediating HBV invasion, while other molecules also exhibit important roles in ensuring efficient and productive HBV infection. This study reports that E-cadherin facilitates HBV entry by directly interacting with glycosylated NTCP to mediate its distribution on the hepatocyte membrane and also affects the efficacy of HBV invasion by influncing hepatocyte polarity.",

    "abstract": "Alpha herpesviruses naturally infect the peripheral nervous system, and can spread to the central nervous system causing severe deadly or debilitating disease. Because alpha herpesviruses spread along synaptic circuits, and infected neurons exhibit altered electrophysiology and increased spontaneous firing, we hypothesized that alpha herpesviruses use activity-dependent synaptic vesicle-like regulated secretory mechanisms for egress and spread from neurons. To address this hypothesis, we used a compartmentalized primary neuron culture system to measure egress and spread of pseudorabies virus (PRV), pharmacological and optogenetics approaches to modulate neuronal firing activity, and a live-cell fluorescence microscopy assay to directly visualize the exocytosis of individual virus particles from infected neurons. Using tetrodotoxin to silence neuronal activity, we observed no inhibition of virus spread, and using potassium chloride or optogenetics to elevate neuronal activity, we also show no increase in virus spread. Using a live-cell fluorescence microscopy method to directly measure virus egress from infected neurons, we observed no association between virus particle exocytosis and intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Finally, we observed virus particle exocytosis occurs in association with constitutive secretory Rab GTPases, Rab6a and Rab8a, not Rab proteins that are associated with the Ca2+-regulated secretory pathway in neurons, Rab3a and Rab11a. Therefore, we conclude that alpha herpesvirus egress and spread is independent of neuronal activity and Ca2+ signaling because virus particle exocytosis uses constitutive secretory mechanisms in neurons.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAlpha herpesviruses, including important human pathogens Herpes Simplex Virus 1 and 2, and Varicella-Zoster Virus, are among the very few viruses that naturally infect the nervous system. These viruses cause recurrent herpetic and zosteriform lesions, peripheral neuropathies, and deadly or debilitating central nervous system diseases. Many of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of viral egress and spread remain unknown, particularly in the context of specialized neuronal cell biology. Our results indicate that elevated firing activity of infected neurons is not functionally or mechanistically linked to virus egress and spread; therefore, therapies targeting peripheral neuropathic symptoms, elevated neuronal activity, and synaptic vesicle secretory mechanisms are unlikely to affect virus spread in the nervous system.",
