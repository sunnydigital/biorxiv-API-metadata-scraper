    "abstract": "Reciprocal adaptation is the hallmark of arms race coevolution, but the symmetry of evolutionary change between interacting species is often untested, even in the best-studied battles of natural enemies. We tested whether prey and predator exhibit symmetrical local co-adaptation in the example of a geographic mosaic of coevolution between toxic newts (Taricha granulosa) and resistant garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis). Prior work showing a tight correlation between levels of newt toxin and snake resistance is regarded as textbook evidence of the intense arms race between natural enemies. Here, we similarly found that toxin and resistance are functionally matched in prey and predator populations, further suggesting that mosaic variation in the armaments of both species results from the local pressures of reciprocal selection. Contrary to conventional wisdom, however, we found that local variation in newt toxin is best predicted by neutral population divergence rather than the resistance of co-occurring predators. Snake resistance, on the other hand, is clearly explained by local levels of prey toxin. Prey populations seem to structure variation in defensive toxin levels across the geographic mosaic, which in turn determines selection on predator resistance. Exaggerated armaments suggest that coevolution occurs in certain hotspots, but our results imply that neutral processes like gene flow--rather than reciprocal adaptation--structure the greatest source of variation across the landscape. This pattern supports the predicted role of \\\"trait remixing\\\" in the geographic mosaic of coevolution, the process by which non-adaptive forces dictate spatial variation in the interactions among species.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWhen the weapons of natural enemies like prey toxins and predator resistance are matched across the geographic landscape, they are usually presumed to result from arms race coevolution. In the textbook example of an arms race, matched levels of newt toxin and garter snake resistance have long been regarded as evidence of such local co-adaptation. To the contrary, we found that local variation in newt toxicity is best explained by the neutral geographic structure of newt populations. This spatial variation of prey in turn dictates local selection on garter snakes, structuring the geographic pattern of predator resistance. These results demonstrate how landscape patterns of phenotypic variation are determined by a mixture of natural selection, historical biogeography, and gene flow that comprise the geographic mosaic of coevolution.",

    "abstract": "Males and females typically pursue divergent reproductive strategies and accordingly require different dietary compositions to maximise their fitness. Here we move from identifying sex-specific optimal diets to understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie male and female responses to dietary variation. We examine male and female gene expression on male-optimal (carbohydrate-rich) and female-optimal (protein-rich) diets. We find that the sexes share a large core of metabolic genes that are concordantly regulated in response to dietary composition. However, we also observe smaller sets of genes with divergent and opposing regulation, most notably in reproductive genes which are over-expressed on each sexs optimal diet. Our results suggest that nutrient sensing output emanating from a shared metabolic machinery are reversed in males and females, leading to opposing diet-dependent regulation of reproduction in males and females. Further analysis and experiments suggest that this reverse regulation occurs within the IIS/TOR network.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring the safety, health, and overall well-being of animals raised for food is both an ethical obligation and a critical component of providing safe food products. The use of antibiotics for maintaining animal health has come under scrutiny in recent years due to the rise of antibiotic resistance globally. Some U.S. producers, especially in the poultry industry, have responded by eliminating their antibiotic use. The number of animals raised without antibiotics (RWA) is growing in the U.S., but there are concerns that RWA practices might negatively impact animal health and welfare. Therefore, the objective of this study was to survey U.S. veterinarians and producers about their experiences and opinions regarding RWA production. Veterinarians, farmers, ranchers, producers, and other stakeholders involved in raising broilers, turkeys, swine, beef cattle or dairy cattle were surveyed. Of the 565 completed responses received, 442 self-reported as practicing veterinarians or producers. Just over half of respondents reported having past or current experience with RWA programs. The main indicated reasons for raising animals without antibiotics were market driven; switching to RWA production was less commonly made for health-related reasons, such as to reduce antibiotic resistance or to improve animal health and welfare. Although respondents felt that RWA production has negative impacts on animal health and welfare, they overwhelmingly (>70%) indicated that the customer (retailer/restaurant/food service) believes that animal and health welfare will be significantly improved. Veterinarians and producers indicated that RWA programs will increase production costs with questionable effect on meat, egg or dairy consumer demand. Many respondents felt that there are times when the RWA label takes priority over animal health and welfare. Respondents generally felt that there was a need for increased auditing/assessment of animal health and welfare in RWA systems.",

    "abstract": "Prevalence of mentholated products for consumption has brought great importance to studies on menthols metabolic pathways to ensure safety, design more potent derivatives, and identify therapeutic benefits. Proposed pathways of (-)-menthol metabolism based on metabolites found experimentally in previous works by Yamaguchi, Caldwell & Farmer, Madyastha & Srivatsan and Hiki et al. were not in agreement. This in silico approach is based on the three in vivo studies and aims to resolve the discrepancies. Reactions in the pathways are conjugation with glucuronic acid/sulfate, oxidation to alcohol, aldehyde & carboxylic acid, and formation of a four-membered/five-membered ring. Gas-phase structures, standard Gibbs energies and SMD solvation energies at B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level were obtained for 102 compounds in the pathways. This study provides a more complete picture of menthol metabolism by combining information from three experimental studies and filling missing links in previously published pathways.",

    "abstract": "TgDCX is a doublecortin-domain protein associated with the conoid fibers, a set of strongly curved non-tubular tubulin-polymers in Toxoplasma. TgDCX deletion impairs conoid structure and parasite invasion. TgDCX contains two tubulin-binding domains: a partial P25-alpha and the DCX/doublecortin domain. Orthologues are found in apicomplexans and their free-living relatives Chromera and Vitrella. We report that isolated TgDCX-containing conoid fibers retain their pronounced curvature, but loss of TgDCX destabilizes the fibers. We crystallized and determined the 3D-structure of the DCX-domain, which is similar to those of human doublecortin and well-conserved among TgDCX orthologues. However, the orthologues vary widely in targeting to the conoid in Toxoplasma and in modulating microtubule organization in Xenopus cells. Several orthologues bind to microtubules in Xenopus cells, but only TgDCX generates short, strongly curved microtubule arcs. EM analysis shows microtubules decorated with TgDCX bundled into rafts, often bordered on one edge by a \"C\"-shaped incomplete tube. A Chromera orthologue closely mimics TgDCX targeting in Toxoplasma and binds to microtubules in Xenopus cells, but does not generate arcs or \"C\"-shaped tubes, and fails to rescue the defects of the TgDCX-knockout parasite. These observations suggest that species-specific features of TgDCX enable it to generate strongly curved tubulin-polymers to support efficient host-cell invasion.",

Reducing the amount of Shh in sclerotome by membrane-tethered hedgehog-interacting protein or by Patched1, but not by dominant active Patched, decreased motoneuron numbers while also compromising myotome differentiation. These effects were a specific and direct consequence of reducing Shh. In addition, grafting notochords in a basal, but not apical location vis-a-vis the tube, profoundly affected motoneuron development, suggesting that initial ligand presentation occurs at the basal side of epithelia corresponding to the sclerotome-neural tube interface.\\n\\nCollectively, our results reveal that the sclerotome is a potential site of a Shh gradient that coordinates development of mesodermal and neural progenitors.\\n\\nSummary statementShh that transits through the sclerotome is presented to the neuroepithelium from its basal aspect to affect motoneuron development.",

    "abstract": "Celecoxib has been demonstrated effective in the prevention and treatment of chronic inflammatory disorders through inhibition of altered cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathways. Despite the benefits for preventing colorectal cancer (CRC), continuous administration may increase risk of cardiovascular events. Understanding microbiome-drug-host interactions is fundamental for improving drug disposition and safety responses of colon-targeted formulations, but little information is available on the bidirectional interaction between individual microbiomes and celecoxib. Here we conducted in vitro batch incubations of faecal microbiota to evaluate the short-term impact of celecoxib on activity and composition of colon bacterial communities. Celecoxib-exposed microbiota shifted metabolic activity and community composition, whereas total transcriptionally active bacterial population was not significantly changed. Butyrate production decreased by 50% in a donor-dependent manner, suggesting that celecoxib impacts in vitro fermentation. Microbiota-derived acetate has been associated with inhibition of cancer markers and our results suggest uptake of acetate for bacterial functions when celecoxib was supplied, which potentially favoured bacterial competition for acetyl-CoA. We further assessed whether colon microbiota modulates anti-inflammatory efficacy of celecoxib using both a simplified inflammation model, and a novel in vitro simulation of the enterohepatic metabolism. Celecoxib was responsible for only 5% of the variance in bacterial community composition but celecoxib-exposed microbiota preserved barrier function and decreased concentrations of IL-8 and CXCL16 in a donor-dependent manner in our two cell models simulating inflammatory milieu in the gut. Our results suggest that celecoxib-microbiome-host interactions may not only elicit adaptations in community composition but also in microbiota functionality and may need to be considered for guaranteeing efficient COX-2 inhibition.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEAs inter-individual changes in the microbiome composition and functionality may be a confounder on pharmacotherapy, we obtained mechanistic understanding on how short-term celecoxib exposure impacts the functional activities of colon communities. Celecoxib-exposed microbiota shifted metabolic activity without impacting numbers of total active bacteria, but only community composition. Thus, increased relative abundance of particular genera during celecoxib supplementation may just indicate changes in maintenance energy. Focus on the influence of acetyl-CoA on cancer cells and verifying whether changes in acetate:propionate:butyrate ratios rather than in taxonomic diversity can be used as markers of decreased inflammation may be the next frontiers for predicting successful NSAID therapy, and ultimately for developing microbiome-based therapies.",

Recordings of dopamine neurons in this system have identified signals related to external reinforcement such as reward and punishment. However, other factors including locomotion, novelty, reward expectation, and internal state have also recently been shown to modulate dopamine neurons. This heterogeneity is at odds with typical modeling approaches in which these neurons are assumed to encode a global, scalar error signal. How is dopamine dependent plasticity coordinated in the presence of such heterogeneity? We develop a modeling approach that infers a pattern of dopamine activity sufficient to solve defined behavioral tasks, given architectural constraints informed by knowledge of mushroom body circuitry. Model dopamine neurons exhibit diverse tuning to task parameters while nonetheless producing coherent learned behaviors. Our results provide a mechanistic framework that accounts for the heterogeneity of dopamine activity during learning and behavior.",

Xvm has also had a major impact on banana and plantain production in East Africa following its detection in Uganda in 2001 and subsequent spread. Effective control of this disease currently relies on integrated disease management (IDM) strategies including minimization of field pathogen inoculum and deployment of wilt resistant enset landraces. Identifying landraces with stable and durable Xvm resistance will greatly accelerate breeding of varieties that can be included as a component of IDM. In this study, 20 enset landraces previously reported to exhibit lower susceptibility to Xvm were grown in pots under open field conditions and inoculated with an aggressive Xvm inoculum isolated from a disease hotspot area. Longitudinal and survival analyses were applied to each landrace, based on disease units representing a combination of area-under-disease progress stairs, disease index and apparent infection rate. Considerable variation was observed among the 20 landraces; however, none exhibited full immunity to Xvm infection. Three landraces, viz. Haela, Mazia and Lemat (HML), showed lowest susceptibility to Xvm as evidenced by lower disease units and higher survival rates. Landraces Kuro, Gezewet, Bededet, and Alagena showed similar levels of Xvm infection as did HML, but with lower survival rates. By contrast, landrace Arkia showed the highest infection level and lowest survival rate, suggesting a high degree of susceptibility to Xvm. This study identifies new material that can be used in future breeding programmes to develop Xvm-resistant enset varieties.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction underlies the etiology of a broad spectrum of diseases including heart disease, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and the general aging process. Therapeutics that restore healthy mitochondrial function hold promise for treatment of these conditions. The synthetic tetrapeptide, elamipretide (SS-31), improves mitochondrial function, but mechanistic details of its pharmacological effects are unknown. Reportedly, SS-31 primarily interacts with the phospholipid cardiolipin in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Here we utilize chemical cross-linking with mass spectrometry to identify protein interactors of SS-31 in mitochondria. The SS-31-interacting proteins, all known cardiolipin binders, fall into two groups, those involved in ATP production through the oxidative phosphorylation pathway and those involved in 2-oxoglutarate metabolic processes. Residues cross-linked with SS-31 reveal binding regions that in many cases, are proximal to cardiolipin-protein interacting regions. These results offer the first glimpse of the protein interaction landscape of SS-31 and provide new mechanistic insight relevant to SS-31 mitochondrial therapy.\n\nSignificance StatementSS-31 is a synthetic peptide that improves mitochondrial function and is currently undergoing clinical trials for treatments of heart failure, primary mitochondrial myopathy, and other mitochondrial diseases. SS-31 interacts with cardiolipin which is abundant in the inner mitochondrial membrane, but mechanistic details of its pharmacological effects are unknown. Here we apply a novel chemical cross-linking/mass spectrometry method to provide the first direct evidence for specific interactions between SS-31 and mitochondrial proteins. The identified SS-31 interactors are functional components in ATP production and 2-oxoglutarate metabolism and signaling, consistent with improved mitochondrial function resultant from SS-31 treatment. These results offer the first glimpse of the protein interaction landscape of SS-31 and provide new mechanistic insight relevant to SS-31 mitochondrial therapy.",

    "abstract": "Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), a genetic bleeding disorder leading to systemic arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the ALK1-ENG-Smad1/5/8 pathway. Evidence suggests that HHT pathogenesis strongly relies on overactivated PI3K-Akt-mTOR and VEGFR2 pathways in endothelial cells (ECs). In the BMP9/10-immunoblocked (BMP9/10ib) neonatal mouse model of HHT, we report here that the mTOR inhibitor, sirolimus, and the receptor tyrosine-kinase inhibitor, nintedanib, could synergistically fully block, but also reversed, retinal AVMs to avert retinal bleeding and anemia. Sirolimus plus nintedanib prevented vascular pathology in the oral mucosa, lungs, and liver of the BMP9/10ib mice, as well as significantly reduced gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia in inducible ALK1-deficient adult mice. Mechanistically, in vivo in BMP9/10ib mouse ECs, sirolimus and nintedanib blocked the overactivation of mTOR and VEGFR2, respectively. Furthermore, we found that sirolimus activated ALK2-mediated Smad1/5/8 signaling in primary ECs--including in HHT patient blood outgrowth ECs--and partially rescued Smad1/5/8 activity in vivo in BMP9/10ib mouse ECs. These data demonstrate that the combined correction of endothelial Smad1/5/8, mTOR, and VEGFR2 pathways opposes HHT pathogenesis. Repurposing of sirolimus plus nintedanib might provide therapeutic benefit in HHT patients.",

    "abstract": "Leptin is one of the main adipokines secreted in breast tissue, and has been associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor progression in breast cancer. Leptin promotes EMT, cell migration and invasion in epithelial breast cells, leading to tumor progression. However, the molecular mechanism that underlies these events is not fully understood; however, the activation of different signaling pathways appears to be essential. In this sense, the effect of leptin on the activation of kinases like Src and FAK, which regulate signaling pathways that activate the EMT program, has not been completely described. Therefore, we investigated the involvement of these kinases using an in vitro model for leptin-induced EMT process in the non-tumorigenic MCF10A cell line. To this end, MCF10A cells were stimulated with leptin, and Src and FAK activation was assessed. Specific events occurring during EMT were also evaluated in the presence or absence of the kinasess chemical inhibitors PP2 and PF-573228. For instance, we tested the expression and subcellular localization of the EMT-related transcription factors Twist and {square}-catenin, by western blot and immunofluorescence. We also evaluated the secretion and activation of matrix metalloproteases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) by gelatin zymography. Invasiveness properties of leptin-stimulated cells were determined by invadopodia formation assays, and by the transwell chamber method. Our results showed that leptin promotes EMT through Src and FAK activation, which leads to the secretion and activation of MMP-2 and MMP-9, invadopodia formation and cell invasion in MCF10A cells. In conclusion, our data suggest that leptin promotes an increase in the expression levels of Twist and {square}-catenin, the secretion of MMP-2, MMP-9, the invadopodia formation and invasion in MCF10A cells in a Src and FAK-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "Male mate preferences have been demonstrated across a range of species, including the Malaysian stalk-eyed fly, Teleopsis dalmanni. This species is subject to SR, an X-linked male meiotic driver, that causes the dysfunction of Y-sperm and the production all female broods. SR is associated with a low frequency inversion spanning most of the X chromosome that causes reduced organismal fitness. While there has been work considering female avoidance of meiotic drive males, the mating decisions of drive-bearing males have not been considered previously. As drive males are of lower genetic quality they may be less able to bear the cost of choice or may experience weaker selection for its maintenance if they are avoided by females. We investigated preference of drive males using binary choice trials. We confirmed that males prefer to mate with large females (indicative of greater fecundity) but found no evidence that the strength of male mate preference differs between drive and standard males. This suggests that the cost of choice does not restrict male reference among drive males. In a further experiment, we found that large eyespan males showed strong preference whereas small eyespan males showed no preference. This is likely to weaken mate preference in drive males, as on average they have reduced eyespan compared to standard males. In this respect, drive males are subject to and exert weak sexual selection.\\n\\nLay summaryWe studied male mate preference in stalk-eyed flies. This species suffers from meiotic drive, a selfish genetic element that causes a reduction in sperm production and organismal fitness. We predicted that males with meiotic drive would show weak mate preference. Males preferred to mate with large females, but there was no difference in the strength of preference between drive and non-drive males. Males with larger eyespan showed stronger mate preference. Meiotic drive males usually have reduced eyespan so on average they exert weaker sexual selection on females, but this is mediated by eyespan, not genotype per se.",

    "abstract": "The adaptive radiation of cichlid fishes in East Afrian Lake Malawi encompasses over 500 species that are believed to have evolved within the last 800 thousand years from a common founder population. It has been proposed that hybridisation between ancestral lineages can provide the genetic raw material to fuel such exceptionally high diversification rates, and evidence for this has recently been presented for the Lake Victoria Region cichlid superflock. Here we report that Lake Malawi cichlid genomes also show evidence of hybridisation between two lineages that split 3-4 million years ago, today represented by Lake Victoria cichlids and the riverine Astatotilapia sp.  ruaha blue. The two ancestries in Malawi cichlid genomes are present in large blocks of several kilobases, but there is little variation in this pattern between Malawi cichlid species, suggesting that the large-scale mosaic structure of the genomes was largely established prior to the radiation. Nevertheless, tens of thousands of polymorphic variants apparently derived from the hybridisation are interspersed in the genomes. These loci show a striking excess of differentiation across ecological subgroups in the Lake Malawi cichlid assemblage, and parental alleles sort differentially into benthic and pelagic Malawi cichlid lineages, consistent with strong differential selection on these loci during species divergence. Furthermore, these loci are enriched for genes involved in immune response and vision, including opsin genes previously identified as important for speciation. Our results reinforce the role of ancestral hybridisation in explosive diversification by demonstrating its significance in one of the largest recent vertebrate adaptive radiations.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRecent innovations in single-cell Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) enable profiling of the epigenetic landscape of thousands of individual cells. scATAC-seq data analysis presents unique methodological challenges. scATAC-seq experiments sample DNA, which, due to low copy numbers (diploid in humans) lead to inherent data sparsity (1-10% of peaks detected per cell) compared to transcriptomic (scRNA-seq) data (20-50% of expressed genes detected per cell). Such challenges in data generation emphasize the need for informative features to assess cell heterogeneity at the chromatin level.\\n\\nResultsWe present a benchmarking framework that was applied to 10 computational methods for scATAC-seq on 13 synthetic and real datasets from different assays, profiling cell types from diverse tissues and organisms. Methods for processing and featurizing scATAC-seq data were evaluated by their ability to discriminate cell types when combined with common unsupervised clustering approaches. We rank evaluated methods and discuss computational challenges associated with scATAC-seq analysis including inherently sparse data, determination of features, peak calling, the effects of sequencing coverage and noise, and clustering performance. Running times and memory requirements are also discussed.\\n\\nConclusionsThis reference summary of scATAC-seq methods offers recommendations for best practices with consideration for both the non-expert user and the methods developer. Despite variation across methods and datasets, SnapATAC, Cusanovich2018, and cisTopic outperform other methods in separating cell populations of different coverages and noise levels in both synthetic and real datasets. Notably, SnapATAC was the only method able to analyze a large dataset (> 80,000 cells).",

    "abstract": "Population-scale biobanks that combine genetic data and high-dimensional phenotyping for a large number of participants provide an exciting opportunity to perform genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify genetic variants associated with diverse quantitative traits and diseases. A major challenge for GWAS in population biobanks is ascertaining disease cases from heterogeneous data sources such as hospital records, digital questionnaire responses, or interviews. In this study, we use genetic parameters including genetic correlation to evaluate whether GWAS performed using cases in the UK Biobank ascertained from hospital records, questionnaire responses, and family history of diseases implicate similar disease genetics across a range of effect sizes. We find that hospital record and questionnaire GWAS largely identify similar genetic effects for many complex phenotypes and that combining together both phenotyping methods improves power to detect genetic associations. We also show that family GWAS using cases ascertained on family history of disease agrees with combined hospital record/questionnaire GWAS and that family history GWAS has better power to detect genetic associations for some phenotypes. Overall, this work demonstrates that digital phenotyping and unstructured phenotype data can be combined with structured data such as hospital records to identify cases for GWAS in biobanks and improve the ability of such studies to identify genetic associations.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is a genetically complex disorder. Multiple genes have been shown to contribute to the risk of PD, and currently 90 independent risk variants have been identified by genome-wide association studies. Thus far, a number of genes (including SNCA, LRRK2, and GBA) have been shown to contain variability across a spectrum of frequency and effect, from rare, highly penetrant variants to common risk alleles with small effect sizes. Variants in GBA, encoding the enzyme glucocerebrosidase, are associated with Lewy body diseases such as PD and Lewy body dementia (LBD). These variants, which reduce or abolish enzymatic activity, confer a spectrum of disease risk, from 1.4- to >10-fold. An outstanding question in the field is what other genetic factors that influence GBA-associated risk for disease, and whether these overlap with known PD risk variants.\\n\\nUsing multiple, large case-control datasets, totalling 217,165 individuals (22,757 PD cases, 13,431 PD proxy cases, 622 LBD cases and 180,355 controls), we identified 1,772 PD cases, 711 proxy cases and 7,624 controls with a GBA variant (p.E326K, p.T369M or p.N370S). We performed a genome-wide association study and analysed the most recent PD-associated genetic risk score to detect genetic influences on GBA risk and age at onset. We attempted to replicate our findings in two independent datasets, including the personal genetics company 23andMe, Inc. and whole-genome sequencing data. Our analysis showed that the overall PD genetic risk score modifies risk for disease and decreases age at onset in carriers of GBA variants. Notably, this effect was consistent across all tested GBA risk variants. Dissecting this signal demonstrated that variants in close proximity to SNCA and CTSB (encoding cathepsin B) are the most significant contributors. Risk variants in the CTSB locus were identified to decrease mRNA expression of CTSB. Additional analyses suggest a possible genetic interaction between GBA and CTSB and GBA p.N370S neurons were shown to have decreased Cathepsin B expression compared to controls. These data provide a genetic basis for modification of GBA-associated PD risk and age at onset and demonstrate that variability at genes implicated in lysosomal function exerts the largest effect on GBA associated risk for disease. Further, these results have important implications for selection of GBA carriers for therapeutic interventions.",

In this study for the first time the composition of the gut bacterial communities in the anjak was surveyed by 16S rRNA gene 454-pyrosequencing. Anjak (Schizocypris altidorsalis), is a native benthopelagic and commercially important fish species in Hamun Lake and Hirmand River system in Sistan basin, Iran. Thirteen 16S rRNA PCR libraries were generated, representing 13 samples of Anjak gut microbiota. After quality filtering, a total of 137 978 read pairs remained from the V3-V6 16S rRNA gene regions, each measuring 680 bp, and were assigned to bacterial OTUs at a minimum sequence homology of 97%, resulted in total 608 OTUs. The results provided evidence of the presence of a very diverse microbial community present in this fish. The majority of sequences belonged to members of the Firmicutes; however, members of the Proteobacteria, Tenericutes, Bacteroidetes and Cyanobacteria were also well represented in the anjak gut microbiota. The most abundant classes recorded in the samples were uncultured CK-1C4-19 class of Tenericutes, Flavobacteriia, -Proteobacteria, Erysipelotrichi, Synechococcophycideae, {gamma}-Proteobacteria, and Clostridia. The presence of many different types of bacteria in the anjak is not unexpected since it has been shown that eukaryotes with a detritivorous and planktivorous diet have a higher microbial diversity compared to omnivorous and herbivorous fish species. Many of these microbes might be of high physiological relevance for snow trout and may play key roles in the functioning of a healthy gut in this fish.",

However, there is still lack of read classification tools to fast and accurately identify the taxonomies of noisy long reads, which is a bottleneck to the use of long read sequencing. Herein, we propose deSAMBA, a tailored long read classification approach that uses a novel sparse approximate match block (SAMB)-based pseudo alignment algorithm. Benchmarks on real datasets demonstrate that deSAMBA enables to simultaneously achieve fast speed and good classification yields, which outperforms state-of-the-art tools and has many potentials to cutting-edge metagenomics studies.\\n\\nAvailability and Implementationhttps://github.com/hitbc/deSAMBA.\\n\\nSupplementary information:",

    "abstract": "Advancements in the field of synthetic biology have been possible due to the development of genetic tools that are able to regulate gene expression. However, the current toolbox of gene regulatory tools for eukaryotic systems have been outpaced by those developed for simple, single-celled systems. Here, we engineered a set of gene regulatory tools by combining self-cleaving ribozymes with various upstream competing sequences that were designed to disrupt ribozyme self-cleavage. As a proof-of-concept, we were able to modulate GFP expression in mammalian cells, and then showed the feasibility of these tools in Drosophila embryos. For each system, the fold-reduction of gene expression was influenced by the location of the self-cleaving ribozyme/upstream competing sequence (i.e. 5 untranslated region (UTR) vs. 3UTR) and the competing sequence used. Together, this work provides a set of genetic tools that can be used to tune gene expression across various eukaryotic systems.",
