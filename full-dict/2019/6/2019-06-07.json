    "abstract": "The misfolding and aggregation of the largely disordered protein, -synuclein, is a central pathogenic event that occurs in the synucleinopathies; a group of neurodegenerative disorders that includes Parkinsons disease. While there is a clear link between protein misfolding and neuronal vulnerability, the precise pathogenic mechanisms employed by disease-associated -synuclein are unresolved. Here, we studied the pathogenicity of misfolded -synuclein produced using the Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification (PMCA) assay. To do this, previous published methods were adapted to allow PMCA-induced protein fibrillization to occur under non-toxic conditions. Insight into potential intracellular targets of misfolded -synuclein was obtained using an unbiased lipid screen of 15 biologically relevant lipids that identified cardiolipin (CA) as a potential binding partner for PMCA-generated misfolded -synuclein. To investigate if such an interaction can impact the properties of -synuclein misfolding, protein fibrillization was carried out in the presence of the lipid. We show CA both accelerates the rate of -synuclein fibrillization and produces species that harbour enhanced resistance to proteolysis. Because CA is virtually exclusively expressed in the inner mitochondrial membrane, we then assessed the ability of these misfolded species to alter mitochondrial respiration in live non-transgenic SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Extensive analysis revealed misfolded -synuclein causes hyperactive mitochondrial respiration without causing any functional deficit. These data give strong support for the mitochondrion as a target for misfolded -synuclein and reveals persistent, hyperactive respiration as a potential up-stream pathogenic event associated with the synucleinopathies.\n\nSummary statementMisfolded -synuclein that was produced using the Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification (PMCA) assay was found to associate with cardiolipin and cause hyperactive respiration in neuronal cells.",

    "abstract": "The fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) is an emerging and most severe pest species in the Old World. It is originally native in the Americas. Since 2016 it has spread widely and rapidly to throughout Africa, the Middle East, India, Southeast Asia and most recently southern China. By May 2019 it has appeared in 13 provinces in most southern China and would spread further to northern China. It is highly likely that S. frugiperda would enter into Japan and Korea via overseas migrations as many other migratory pests did before. To evaluate the invasion risk of S. frugiperda into Japan and Korean Peninsula, we modelled the rate of expansion and future potential migratory range of the insect by a trajectory analytical approach with flight behaviour of S. frugiperda implemented, and meteorological data of past five years (2014-2018) used. Our results predicted that S. frugiperda would migrate from southern and eastern China into Japan and Korea soon. Most likely, Japan would be invaded from Fujian and Zhejiang on 1 June - 15 July, and Kyushu, Shikoku and south-western Honshu could face the highest risk of S. frugiperdas invasion. Korea would be most possibly reached by S. frugiperda from northern Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Shandong on 1 June - 15 July and later. Our results indicated a very high risk that S. frugiperda would annually invade Japan and the Korean Peninsula and cause a possible significant decrease in agricultural productivity.",

    "abstract": "Endemic disease transmission is an important ecological process that is challenging to study because of low occurrence rates. Here, we investigate the ecological drivers of two coral diseases -- growth anomalies and tissue loss -- affecting five coral species. We first show that a statistical framework called the case-control study design, commonly used in epidemiology but rarely applied to ecology, provided high predictive accuracy (67-82%) and disease detection rates (60-83%) compared with a traditional statistical approach that yielded high accuracy (98-100%) but low disease detection rates (0-17%). Using this framework, we found evidence that 1) larger corals have higher disease risk; 2) shallow reefs with low herbivorous fish abundance, limited water motion, and located adjacent to watersheds with high fertilizer and pesticide runoff promote low levels of growth anomalies, a chronic coral disease; and 3) wave exposure, stream exposure, depth, and low thermal stress are associated with tissue loss disease risk during interepidemic periods. Variation in risk factors across host-disease pairs suggests that either different pathogens cause the same gross lesions in different species or that the same disease may arise in different species under different ecological conditions.",

    "abstract": "To construct our perceptual world, the brain categorizes variable sensory cues into behaviorally-relevant groupings. Categorical representations are apparent within a distributed fronto-temporo-parietal brain network but how this neural circuitry is shaped by experience remains undefined. Here, we asked whether speech (and music) categories might be formed within different auditory-linguistic brain regions depending on listeners auditory expertise. We recorded EEG in highly skilled (musicians) vs. novice (nonmusicians) perceivers as they rapidly categorized speech and musical sounds. Musicians showed perceptual enhancements across domains, yet source EEG data revealed a double dissociation in the neurobiological mechanisms supporting categorization between groups. Whereas musicians coded categories in primary auditory cortex (PAC), nonmusicians recruited non-auditory regions (e.g., inferior frontal gyrus, IFG) to generate category-level information. Functional connectivity confirmed nonmusicians increased left IFG involvement reflects stronger routing of signal from PAC directed to IFG, presumably because sensory coding is insufficient to construct categories in less experienced listeners. Our findings establish auditory experience modulates specific engagement and inter-regional communication in the auditory-linguistic network supporting CP. Whereas early canonical PAC representations are sufficient to generate categories in highly trained ears, less experienced perceivers broadcast information downstream to higher-order linguistic brain areas (IFG) to construct abstract sound labels.",

    "abstract": "SummaryWhile some non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are assigned to critical regulatory roles, most remain functionally uncharacterized. This presents a challenge whenever an interesting set of ncRNAs needs to be analyzed in a functional context. Transcripts located close-by on the genome are often regulated together. This genomic spatial proximity can lead to a functional association. Based on this idea, we present a tool, NoRCE, that performs cis enrichment analysis for a given set of ncRNAs. Enrichment is carried out using the functional annotations of the coding genes located proximal to the input ncRNAs. NoRCE allows incorporating other biologically relevant information such as topologically associating domain (TAD) boundaries, co-expression patterns, and miRNA target prediction information. NoRCE repository provides several data, such as cell-line specific TAD boundaries, functional gene sets, and expression data for coding and ncRNAs specific to cancer for the analysis. Additionally, users can utilize their custom data files in their investigation. Enrichment results can be retrieved in a tabular format or visualized in several different ways. NoRCE is currently available for the following species: human, mouse, rat, zebrafish, fruit fly, worm, and yeast. NoRCE is a platform-independent, user-friendly, comprehensive R package that could be used to gain insight into the functional importance of a list of any type of interesting ncRNAs. Users can run the pipeline in a single function; also, the tool offers flexibility to conduct the users preferred analysis in a single base and design their pipeline.

    "abstract": "Protein-based fluorescent glutamate sensors have the potential for real-time monitoring of synaptic and cellular glutamate concentration changes, however even the fastest currently available sensors response times of 2-3 ms are too slow for accurate reporting of the post-synaptic AMPA receptor function in physiological conditions. We have developed probes based on the bacterial periplasmic glutamate/aspartate binding protein with either an endogenously fluorescent protein or a synthetic fluorophore as the indicator of glutamate binding: affinity variants of iGluSnFR termed iGluh, iGlum and iGlul covering a range of Kd-s (5.8 M, 2.1 mM and 50 mM, respectively) and a novel fluorescently labelled indicator, Fl-GluBP with a Kd of 9.7 M are presented. The fluorescence response kinetics of all the probes are consistent with two-step mechanisms involving ligand binding and rate limiting isomerisation, however the contribution in each step to the total fluorescence enhancement and kinetic paths to the final state are diverse. In contrast to the previously characterised ultrafast indicators iGluu and iGluf, for which fluorescence enhancement occurred only in the rate limiting isomerisation step, the sensors described here all have biphasic binding kinetics with a significant fraction of the fluorescence increase evoked by glutamate binding which, in the case of iGluh and Fl-GluBP, occurs with a diffusion limited rate constant. The above genetically encoded and chemically labelled fluorescent glutamate sensor variants demonstrate how single amino acid changes around the binding site introduce structural heterogeneity affecting the kinetic mechanism of interactions with glutamate. Through their broad affinity range and mechanistic variety, the probes contribute to a novel toolkit for monitoring processes of glutamate neurotransmission and cellular homeostasis.\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEGlutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter, important in synaptic plasticity e.g. memory formation. Although predicted to clear rapidly from the synaptic cleft following presynaptic release, optical monitoring of glutamate neurotransmission has only become possible with the advent of fluorescent, protein-based indicators. Understanding their biophysical properties is important for quantification of the observed processes. Here we report the biophysical characterisation of a number of glutamate indicator variants based on the bacterial periplasmic glutamate/aspartate binding protein, revealing the subtle differences in their kinetic pathway caused by structural alteration of the glutamate binding protein by point mutations. Diffusion limited glutamate binding indicated by a novel chemically labelled probe hints at the mechanism that underlies the rapid response of the AMPA receptor.",

Previous efforts in this area have predicted the responses of a receptor to some odors, using the known responses of the same receptor to other odors. Here we present a method to predict the responses of a receptor without any known responses, by using available data about the responses of other conspecific receptors and their sequences. We applied this method to olfactory receptors in insects Drosophila melanogaster (both adult and larva) and Anopheles gambiae, and to mouse and human olfactory receptors.

    "abstract": "Many factors play a role in choosing what to eat or drink. Here we explored the role of sensation to explain these differences, drawing on consumer reviews for commercially available food products sold through an online retailer. We analyzed 393,568 unique food product reviews from Amazon customers with a total of 256,043 reviewers rating 67,553 products. Taste-associated words were mentioned more than words associated with cost, food texture, customer service, nutrition, smell, or those referring to the trigeminal senses, e.g., spicy. We computed the overall number of reviews that mentioned taste qualities: the word taste was mentioned in over 30% of the reviews (N= 142,768), followed by sweet (10.7%, N=42,315), bitter (2.9%, N=11,424), sour (2.1%, N=8,252), and salty (1.4%, N=5,688). We identified 38 phrases used to describe the evaluation of sweetness, finding that  too sweet was used in nearly 0.8% of the reviews and oversweetness was mentioned over 25 times more often than under-sweetness. We then focused on  polarizing products, those that elicited a wide difference of opinion (as measured by the ranges of the product ratings). Using the products that had more than 50 reviews, we identified the top 10 most polarizing foods (i.e., those with the largest standard deviation in ratings) and provide representative comments about the polarized taste experience of consumers. Overall, these results support the primacy of taste in real-world food ratings and individualized taste experience, such as whether a product is  too sweet. Analysis of consumer review data sets can provide information about purchasing decisions and customer sensory responses to particular commercially available products and represents a promising methodology for the emerging field of sensory nutrition.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is epidemiologically correlated with both type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. However, the causal inter-relationships among the three diseases have not been completely investigated.\\n\\nAimWe aim to explore the causal relationships among the three diseases.\\n\\nDesign and methodsWe performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on fatty liver disease in [~]400,000 UK BioBank samples. Using this data as well as the largest-to-date publicly available summary-level GWAS data, we performed a two-sample bidirectional Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis. This analysis tested the causal inter-relationship between NAFLD, T2D, and obesity, as well as the association between genetically driven NAFLD (with two well-established SNPs at the PNPLA3 and TM6SF2 loci) and glycemic and lipidemic traits, respectively. Transgenic mice expressing the human PNPLA3 I148I (TghPNPLA3-I148I) and PNPLA3 I148M (TghPNPLA3-I148M) isoforms were used to further validate the causal effects.\\n\\nResultsWe found that genetically instrumented hepatic steatosis significantly increased the risk for T2D (OR=1.3, 95% CI: [1.2, 1.4], p=8.3e-14) but not the intermediate glycemic phenotypes at the Bonferroni-adjusted level of significance (p<0.002). There was a moderate, but significant causal association between genetically driven hepatic steatosis and decreased risk for BMI ({beta}=- 0.027 SD, 95%CI: [-0.043, -0.01], p=1.3e-4), but an increased risk for WHRadjBMI (Waist-Hip Ratio adjusted for BMI) ({beta}=0.039 SD, 95%CI: [0.023, 0.054], p=8.2e-7), as well as a decreased level for total cholesterol ({beta}=-0.084 SD, 95%CI [-0.13, -0.036], p=6.8e-4), but not triglycerides ({beta}=0.02 SD, 95%CI [-0.023, 0.062], p=0.36). The reverse MR analyses suggested that genetically driven T2D (OR=1.1, 95% CI: [1.0, 1.2], p=1.7e-3), BMI (OR=2.3, 95% CI: [2.0, 2.7], p=1.4e-25) and WHRadjBMI (OR=1.5, 95% CI: [1.3, 1.8], p=1.1e-6) causally increase the NAFLD risk. In the animal study, as compared to the TghPNPLA3-I148I controls, the TghPNPLA3-I148M mice developed higher fasting glucose level and reduced glucose clearance. Meanwhile, the TghPNPLA3-I148M mice demonstrated a reduced body weight, increased central to peripheral fat ratio, decreased circulating total cholesterol as compared to the TghPNPLA3-I148I controls.\\n\\nConclusionThis large-scale bidirectional MR study suggests that lifelong, genetically driven NAFLD is a causal risk factor for T2D (hence potentially a \\\"NAFLD-driven T2D\\\" subtype) and central obesity (or \\\"NAFLD-driven obesity\\\" subtype), but protects against overall obesity; while genetically driven T2D, obesity, and central obesity also causally increase the risk of NAFLD, hence a \\\"metabolic NAFLD\\\". This causal relationship revealed new insights into disease subtypes and provided novel hypotheses for precision treatment or prevention for the three diseases.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivePhotovoltaic retinal prostheses theoretically offer the possibility of standalone high-resolution electrical stimulation of the retina. However, in artificial vision, achieving locally selective epiretinal stimulation is particularly challenging, on the grounds of axonal activation and electrical cell coupling.\\n\\nApproachHere we show that electrical and photovoltaic stimulation of dystrophic retinal circuits with capacitive-like pulses leads to a greater efficiency for indirect network-mediated activation of retinal ganglion cells. In addition, a biophysical model of the inner retina stimulation is proposed to investigate the waveform and duration commitments in the genesis of indirect activity of retinal ganglion cells.\\n\\nMain resultsBoth in-vitro and in-silico approaches suggest that the application of long voltage pulses or gradual voltage changes are more effective to sustainably activate the inner excitatory and inhibitory layers of the retina, thus leading to a reproducible indirect response. The involvement of the inhibitory feedback from amacrine cells in the forming of indirect patterns represents a novel biological tool to locally cluster the response of the retinal ganglion cells.\\n\\nSignificanceThese results demonstrate that recruiting inner retina cells with epiretinal stimulation enables not only to bypass axonal stimulation but also to obtain a more focal activation thanks to the natural lateral inhibition. In this perspective, the use of capacitive-like waveforms generated by photovoltaic prostheses may allow improving the neural response resolution while standing high-frequency stimulation.",

Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) modules (n=10) and metabolite set enrichment analysis (MSEA; n=23) were also evaluated.

C36:2 phosphatidylcholine (PC) plasmalogen had the strongest statistical association with lower risk (OR=0.11, 95%CI=0.03-0.35; p<0.001/adjusted-p=0.06) and pseudouridine with higher risk (OR=9.84, 95%CI=2.89-37.82; p<0.001/adjusted-p=0.07) of non-serous tumors.

TAGs may also be important, particularly for rapidly fatal tumors, with associations differing by structural features. Validation in independent prospective studies and complementary experimental work to understand biological mechanisms is needed.",

    "abstract": "The transmission patterns of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) remain poorly understood, despite over half a million incident cases in 2017. Modeling TB transmission networks can provide insight into the nature and drivers of transmission, but incomplete and non-random sampling of TB cases can pose challenges to making inferences from epidemiologic and molecular data. We conducted a quantitative bias analysis to assess the effect of missing cases on a transmission network inferred from Mtb sequencing data on extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB cases in South Africa. We tested scenarios in which cases were missing at random, differentially by clinical characteristics, or differentially by transmission (i.e., cases with many links were under or over-sampled). Under the assumption cases were missing at random, cases in the complete, modeled network would have had a mean of 20 or more transmission links, which is far higher than expected, in order to reproduce the observed, partial network. Instead, we found that the most likely scenario involved undersampling of high-transmitting cases, and further models provided evidence for superspreading behavior. This is, to our knowledge, the first study to define and assess the support for different mechanisms of missingness in a study of TB transmission. Our findings should caution interpretation of results of future studies of TB transmission in high-incidence settings, given the potential for biased sampling, and should motivate further research aimed at identifying the specific host, pathogen, or environmental factors contributing to superspreading.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLittle is known about the functional relationship of delaying second-line treatment initiation for HIV-positive patients and mortality, given a patients immune status.\n\nMethodsWe included 7255 patients starting antiretroviral therapy between 2004-2017, from 9 South African cohorts, with virological failure and complete baseline data. We estimated the impact of switch time on the hazard of death using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) of marginal structural models. The non-linear relationship between month of switch and the 5-year survival probability, stratified by CD4 count at failure, was estimated with targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE). We adjusted for measured time-varying confounding by CD4 count, viral load and visit frequency.\n\nResults5-year mortality was estimated as 10.5% (2.2%; 18.8%) for immediate switch and as 26.6% (20.9%; 32.3%) for no switch (49.9% if CD4 count<100 cells/mm3). The hazard of death was estimated to be 0.40 (95%CI: 0.33-0.48) times lower if everyone had been switched immediately compared to never. The shorter the delay in switching, the lower the hazard of death, e.g. delaying 30-60 days reduced the hazard 0.52 (0.41-0.65) times, and 60-120 days 0.56 (0.47-0.66) times.\n\nConclusionsEarly treatment switch is particularly important for patients with low CD4 counts at failure.",

    "abstract": "Two full model approaches was compared with respect to their ability to handle missing covariate information. The reference data analysis approach was the full model method in which the covariate effects are estimated conventionally using fixed effects, and missing covariate data is imputed with the median of the non-missing covariate information. This approach was compared to a novel full model method which treats the covariate data as observed data and estimates the covariates as random effects. A consequence of this way of handling the covariates is that no covariate imputation is required and that any missingness in the covariates is handled implicitly. The comparison between the two analysis methods was based on simulated data from a model of height for age z-scores as a function of age. Data was simulated with increasing degrees of randomly missing covariate information (0-90%) and analyzed using each of the two analysis approaches. Not surprisingly, the precision in the parameter estimates from both methods decreased with increasing degrees of missing covariate information. However, while the bias in the parameter estimates increased in a similar fashion for the reference method, the full random effects approach provided unbiased estimates for all degrees of covariate missingness.",

    "abstract": "Delays in case reporting are common to disease surveillance systems, making it difficult to track diseases in real-time. \\\"Nowcast\\\" approaches attempt to estimate the complete case counts for a given reporting date, using a time series of case reports that is known to be incomplete due to reporting delays. Modeling the reporting delay distribution is a common feature of nowcast approaches. However, many nowcast approaches ignore a crucial feature of infectious disease transmission--that future cases are intrinsically linked to past reported cases--and are optimized to a single application, which may limit generalizability. Here, we present a Bayesian approach, NobBS (Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing) capable of producing smooth and accurate nowcasts in multiple disease settings. We test NobBS on dengue in Puerto Rico and influenza-like illness (ILI) in the United States to examine performance and robustness across settings exhibiting a range of common reporting delay characteristics (from stable to time-varying), and compare this approach with a published nowcasting package. We show that introducing a temporal relationship between cases considerably improves performance when the reporting delay distribution is time-varying, and we identify trade-offs in the role of moving windows to accurately capture changes in the delay. We present software implementing this new approach (R package \\\"NobBS\\\") for widespread application.\\n\\nSignificanceAchieving accurate, real-time estimates of disease activity is challenged by delays in case reporting. However, approaches that seek to estimate cases in spite of reporting delays often do not consider the temporal relationship between cases during an outbreak, nor do they identify characteristics of robust approaches that generalize to a wide range of surveillance contexts with very different reporting delays. Here, we present a smooth Bayesian nowcasting approach that produces accurate estimates that capture the time evolution of the epidemic curve and outperform a previous approach in the literature. We assess the performance for two diseases to identify important features of the reporting delay distribution that contribute to the models performance and robustness across surveillance settings.",

    "abstract": "PurposeReducing colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality through early detection would improve efficacy if targeted. A CRC risk-prediction model incorporating personal, family, genetic and environmental risk factors could enhance prediction.\\n\\nMethodsWe developed risk-prediction models using population-based CRC cases (N=4,445) and controls (N=3,967) recruited by the Colon Cancer Family Registry Cohort (CCFRC). A familial risk profile (FRP) was calculated to summarize individuals risk based on their CRC family history, family structure, germline mutation probability in major susceptibility genes, and a polygenic component. Using logistic regression, we developed risk models including individuals FRP or a binary CRC family-history (FH), and risk factors collected at recruitment. Model validation used follow-up data for population-(N=12,052) and clinic-based (N=5,584) relatives with no cancer history at recruitment, assessing calibration (E/O) and discrimination (AUC).\\n\\nResultsThe E/O (95% confidence interval [CI]) for FRP models for population-based relatives were 1.04 (0.74-1.45) and 0.86 (0.64-1.20) for men and women, and for clinic-based relatives 1.15 (0.87-1.58) and 1.04 (0.76-1.45). The age-adjusted AUC (95% CI) for FRP models in population-based relatives were 0.69 (0.60-0.78) and 0.70 (0.62-0.77), and for clinic-based relatives 0.77 (0.69-0.84) and 0.68 (0.60-0.76). The incremental values of AUC (95% CI) for FRP over FH models for population-based relatives were 0.08 (0.01-0.15) and 0.10 (0.04-0.16), and for clinic-based relatives 0.11 (0.05-0.17) and 0.11 (0.06-0.17).\\n\\nConclusionThe FRP-based model and FH-based model calibrate well in both settings. The FRP-based model provided better risk-prediction and discrimination than the FH-based model. A detailed family history may be useful for targeted risk-based screening and clinical management.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNo serological assay has 100% sensitivity. Statistically, the concentration of specific antibodies against antigens of parasites decreases with the duration of infection. This can result in false negative outputs of diagnostic tests for the subjects with old infectiong, e.g., for individuals infected in childhood. When a property of seronegative and seropositive subjects is compared under these circumstances, the statistical tests can detect no significant difference between these two groups of subjects, despite the fact that infected and noninfected subjects differ. When the effect of the infection has a cumulative character and subjects with an older infection (potential false negatives) are affected to a greater degree, we can even get paradoxical result of the comparison - the seronegative subjects have on average lower value of certain traits, e.g. IQ, despite the infection having a negative effect on the trait. A permutation test for the contaminated data, implemented, e.g., in the program Treept or available as a comprehensibly commented R function in the supplement of this paper, can be used to reveal and to eliminate the effect of false negatives.\\n\\nMethodsWe used a Monte Carlo simulation in the program R to show that the permutation test implemented in the programs Treept and PTPT is a conservative test.\\n\\nResultsWe showed that the test could provide false negative but not false positive results if the studied population contains no subpopulation of false negative subjects. We also introduced R version of the test expanded by skewness analysis, which helps to estimate the proportion of false negative subjects based on the assumption of equal data skewness in groups of healthy and infected individuals.\\n\\nConclusionsBased on the results of simulations and our experience with empirical studies we recommend the usage of permutation test for contaminated data whenever seronegative and seropositive individuals are compared.",

    "abstract": "AimThe main aim of this study was to consider the extent to which the use of worldwide severity distributions in Burden of Disease studies are influencing cross-country comparisons, by comparing Global Burden of Disease distributions with nationally derived severity distributions in Scotland for cancer types.\\n\\nMethodsWe obtained individual records from the Scottish Cancer Registry for 21 cancer types and linked these to registered deaths. We estimated prevalent cancer cases for 2016 and assigned each case to sequelae using Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2016 study definitions. We compared the impact of using severity distributions based on GBD 2016, a Scotland-wide distribution, and a distribution specific to deprivation strata in Scotland, on the weighted-average disability weights for each cancer type in Scotland.\\n\\nResultsThe relative difference in point estimates of weighted-average disability weights based on GBD 2016 worldwide severity distributions compared with Scottish national severity distributions resulted in overestimates in the majority of cancers (17 out of 21 cancer types). The largest overestimates were for gallbladder and biliary tract cancer (70.8%), oesophageal cancer (31.6%) and pancreatic cancer (31.2%). Furthermore, the use of weighted-average disability weights based on Scottish national severity distributions rather than sub-national Scottish severity distributions stratified by deprivation quintile overestimated weighted-average disability weights in the least deprived areas (16 out of 18 cancer types), and underestimated in the most deprived areas (16 out of 18 cancer types).\\n\\nConclusionOur findings illustrate a bias in point estimates of weighted-average disability weights created using worldwide severity distributions. This bias would have led to the misrepresentation of non-fatal estimates of the burden of individual cancers, and underestimated the scale of socioeconomic inequality in this non-fatal burden. This highlights the importance of not interpreting non-fatal estimates of burden of disease too precisely, especially for sub-national estimates and those comparing populations when relying on data inputs from other countries. It is essential to ensure that any estimates are based upon the best available country-specific data at the lowest granularity.",
