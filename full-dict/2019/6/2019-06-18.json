    "abstract": "Afamin, a human blood plasma glycoprotein, a putative multi-functional transporter of hydrophobic molecules and a marker for metabolic syndrome, poses multiple challenges for crystallographic structure determination, both practically and in analysis of the models. Several hundred crystals were analysed, and unusual variability in cell volume and difficulty solving the structure despite a ~34% sequence identity with non-glycosylated human serum albumin indicated that the molecule exhibits variable and context-sensitive packing, despite greatly simplified glycosylation in insect cell expressed recombinant afamin. Controlled dehydration of the crystals was able to stabilise the orthorhombic crystal form reducing the number of molecules in the asymmetric unit from the monoclinic form and changing the conformational states of the protein. An iterative strategy, using fully automatic experiments available on MASSIF-1, was used to quickly determine the optimal protocol to achieve the phase transition that should be readily applicable to many types of sample. The study also highlights the drawback of using a single crystallographic structure model for computation modelling purposes given that conformational state of the binding sites and electron density in the binding site, likely resulting from PEGs, greatly varies between models. This also holds for the analysis of unspecific low-affinity ligands, where often a variety fragments with similar uncertainty can be modelled, inviting interpretative bias. As a promiscuous transporter, afamin also seems to bind Gadoteridol, a magnetic resonance imaging contrast compound, in at least two sites. One pair of Gadoteridol molecules is located near the human albumin Sudlow-site, and a second Gadoteridol at an intermolecular site in proximity of domain IA. The data from the co-crystals provide an opportunity to evaluate modern metrics of data quality in the context of the information that can be gleaned from data sets that would be abandoned on classical measures.\\n\\nSynopsisControlled dehydration experiments have revealed a new crystal form of afamin, a human blood plasma glycoprotein and transporter of hydrophobic molecules. The comparison shows substantial molecular plasticity and amplifies the necessity to examine multiple crystal forms and to refine multiple models, while at the same time the new structure cautions against interpretation of fatty acid ligand density in crystals derived from PEG as major precipitants. An isomorphic low-resolution structure model suggests that afamin is capable of transporting Gadolinium-DO3A, a magnetic resonance imaging compound.",

    "abstract": "The mechanism by which microtubules find kinetochores during spindle formation is a key question in cell biology. Previous experimental studies have shown that although search-and-capture of kinetochores by dynamic microtubules is a dominant mechanism in many organisms, several other capture mechanisms are also possible. One such mechanism reported in Schizosaccharomyces pombe shows that microtubules can exhibit a prolonged pause between growth and shrinkage. During the pause, the microtubules pivoted at the spindle pole body search for the kinetochores by performing an angular diffusion. Is the latter mechanism purely accidental, or could there be any physical advantage underlying its selection? To compare the efficiency of these two mechanisms, we numerically study distinct models and compute the timescales of kinetochore capture as a function of microtubule number N. We find that the capture timescales have non-trivial dependences on microtubule number, and one mechanism may be preferred over the other depending on this number. While for small N (as in fission yeast), the typical capture times due to rotational diffusion are lesser than those for search-and-capture, the situation is reversed beyond a certain N. The capture times for rotational diffusion tend to saturate due to geometrical constraints, while those for search-and-capture reduce monotonically with increasing N making it physically more efficient. The results provide a rationale for the common occurrence of classic search-and-capture process in many eukaryotes which have few hundreds of dynamic microtubules, as well as justify exceptions in cells with fewer microtubules.",

    "abstract": "Observed data from many research disciplines, ranging from cellular biology to economics, often follow a particular long-tailed distribution known as a power law. Despite the ubiquity of natural power laws, inferring the exact form of the distribution from sampled data remains challenging. The possible presence of multiple generative processes giving rise to an unknown weighted mixture of distinct power law distributions in a single dataset presents additional challenges. We present a probabilistic solution to these issues by developing a Bayesian inference approach, with Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, to accurately estimate power law exponents, the number of mixtures, and their weights, for both discrete and continuous data. We determine an objective prior distribution that is invariant to reparameterization of parameters, and demonstrate its effectiveness to accurately infer exponents, even in the low sample limit. Finally, we provide a comprehensive and documented software package, written in Python, of our Bayesian inference methodology, freely available at https://github.com/AtwalLab/BayesPowerlaw.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAmyloid-{beta} PET and CSF A{beta}42 yield discordant results in 10-20% of patients, possibly providing unique information. Although the predictive power of demographic, clinical, genetic and imaging features for amyloid-positivity has previously been investigated, it is unknown whether these features differentially predict amyloid-{beta} status based on PET or CSF, or whether this differs by disease stage.\\n\\nMethodsWe included 768 patients (subjective cognitive decline (SCD, n=194), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n=127), dementia (AD and non-AD, n=447) with amyloid-{beta} PET and CSF A{beta}42 measurement within one year. 97(13%) patients had discordant PET/CSF amyloid-{beta} status. We performed parallel random forest models predicting separately PET and CSF status using 17 patient features (demographics, APOE4 positivity, CSF (p)tau, cognitive performance, and MRI visual ratings) in the total patient group and stratified by syndrome diagnosis. Thereafter, we selected features with the highest variable importance measure (VIM) as input for logistic regression models, where amyloid status on either PET or CSF was predicted by (i) the selected patient feature, and (ii) the patient feature adjusted for the status of the other amyloid modality.\\n\\nResultsAPOE4, CSF tau and p-tau had highest VIM for PET and CSF in all groups. In the amyloid-adjusted logistic regression models, p-tau was a significant predictor for PET-amyloid in SCD (OR=1.02[1.01-1.04], pFDR=0.03), MCI (OR=1.05[1.02-1.07], pFDR<0.01) and dementia (OR=1.04[1.03-1.05], pFDR<0.001), but not for CSF-amyloid. APOE4 (OR=3.07[1.33-7.07], punc<0.01) was associated with CSF-amyloid in SCD, while it was only predictive for PET-amyloid in MCI (OR=9.44[2.93,30.39], pFDR<0.01). Worse MMSE scores (OR=1.21[1.03-1.41], punc=0.02) were associated to CSF-amyloid status in SCD, whereas worse memory (OR=1.17[1.05-1.31], pFDR=0.02) only predicted PET positivity in dementia.\\n\\nConclusionAmyloid status based on either PET or CSF was predicted by different patient features and this varied by disease stage, suggesting that PET-CSF discordance yields unique information. The stronger associations of both APOE4 carriership and worse memory z-scores with CSF-amyloid in SCD suggests that CSF-amyloid is more sensitive early in the disease course. The higher predictive value of CSF p-tau for a positive PET scan suggests that PET is more specific to AD pathology. These findings can influence the choice between amyloid biomarkers in future studies or trials.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila melanogaster males perform a series of courtship behaviors that, when successful, result in copulation with a female. For over a century, mutations in the yellow gene, named for its effects on pigmentation, have been known to reduce male mating success. Prior work has suggested that yellow influences mating behavior through effects on wing extension, song, and/or courtship vigor. Here, we rule out these explanations, as well as effects on the nervous system more generally, and find instead that the effects of yellow on male mating success are mediated by its effects on pigmentation of male-specific leg structures called sex combs. Loss of yellow expression in these modified bristles reduces their melanization, which changes their structure and causes difficulty grasping females prior to copulation. These data illustrate why the mechanical properties of anatomy, and not just neural circuitry, must be considered to fully understand the development and evolution of behavior.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacterial blooms are causing increasing issues across the globe. Bloom forecasting can facilitate adaptation to blooms. Most bloom forecasting models depend on weekly or fortnightly sampling, but these sparse measurements can miss important dynamics. Here we develop forecasting models from five years of high frequency summer monitoring in a shallow lake (which serves as an important regional water supply). A suite of models were calibrated to predict cyanobacterial fluorescence (a biomass proxy) using measurements of: cyanobacterial fluorescence, water temperature, light, and wind speed. High temporal autocorrelation contributed to relatively strong predictive power over 1, 4 and 7 day intervals. Higher order derivatives of water temperature helped improve forecasting accuracy. While traditional monitoring and modelling have supported forecasting on longer timescales, we show high frequency monitoring combined with telemetry allows forecasting over timescales of 1 day to 1 week, supporting early warning, enhanced monitoring, and adaptation of water treatment processes.",

    "abstract": "The ecological radiation of amphipods is striking among crustaceans. Despite high diversity, global distribution and key roles in all aquatic environments, little is known about their ecological transitions, evolutionary timescale and phylogenetic relationships. It has been proposed that the amphipod ecological diversification began in the Late Palaeozoic. By contrast, due to their affinity for cold/oxygenated water and absence of pre-Cenozoic fossils, we hypothesized that the ecological divergence of amphipods arose throughout the cool Late Mesozoic/Cenozoic. We tested our hypothesis by inferring a large-scale, time-calibrated, multilocus phylogeny, and reconstructed evolutionary patterns for major ecological traits. Although our results reveal a Late Palaeozoic amphipod origin, diversification and ecological divergence ensued only in the Late Mesozoic, overcoming a protracted stasis in marine littoral habitats. Multiple independent post-Jurassic radiations took place in deep-sea, freshwater, terrestrial, pelagic and symbiotic environments, usually postdating deep-sea faunal extinctions, and corresponding with significant climatic cooling, tectonic reconfiguration, continental flooding, and increased oceanic oxygenation. We conclude that the profound Late Mesozoic global changes triggered a tipping point in amphipod evolution by unlocking ecological opportunities that promoted radiation into many new niches. Our study also provides a solid, time-calibrated, evolutionary framework to accelerate research on this overlooked, yet globally important taxon.",

    "abstract": "Enhancers are cis-regulatory elements that control most of the developmental and spatial gene expression in eukaryotes. Genetic variation of enhancer sequences is known to influence phenotypes, but the effect of enhancer variation upon enhancer functional activity and downstream phenotypes has barely been examined in any species. In the African malaria vector, Anopheles coluzzii, we identified a pilot set of candidate enhancers in the proximity of genes relevant for immunity, insecticide resistance, and development. The candidate enhancers were functionally validated using luciferase reporter assays, and their activity was found to be essentially independent of their physical orientation, a typical property of enhancers. All of the enhancer intervals segregated genetically polymorphic alleles, which displayed significantly different levels of functional activity, and inactive null alleles were also observed. Deletion mutagenesis and functional testing revealed a modular structure of positive and negative regulatory elements within the tested enhancers. The enhancer alleles carry genetic polymorphisms that also segregate in wild A. coluzzii populations in West Africa, indicating that enhancer variants with likely phenotypic consequences are frequent in nature. These results demonstrate the feasibility of screening for naturally polymorphic A. coluzzii enhancers that underlie important aspects of malaria transmission and vector biology.",

    "abstract": "Repeated stimuli elicit attenuated responses in visual cortex relative to novel stimuli. This adaptation phenomenon can be considered a form of rapid learning and a signature of perceptual memory. Adaptation occurs not only when a stimulus is repeated immediately, but also when there is a lag in terms of time and other intervening stimuli before the repetition. But how does the visual system keep track of which stimuli are repeated, especially after long delays and many intervening stimuli? We hypothesized that the hippocampus supports long-lag adaptation, given that it learns from single experiences, maintains information over delays, and sends feedback to visual cortex. We tested this hypothesis with fMRI in an amnesic patient, LSJ, who has encephalitic damage to the medial temporal lobe resulting in complete bilateral hippocampal loss. We measured adaptation at varying time lags between repetitions in functionally localized visual areas that were intact in LSJ. We observed that these areas track information over a few minutes even when the hippocampus is unavailable. Indeed, LSJ and controls were identical when attention was directed away from the repeating stimuli: adaptation occurred for lags up to three minutes, but not six minutes. However, when attention was directed toward stimuli, controls now showed an adaptation effect at six minutes but LSJ did not. These findings suggest that visual cortex can support one-shot perceptual memories lasting for several minutes but that the hippocampus is necessary for adaptation in visual cortex after longer delays when stimuli are task-relevant.",

    "abstract": "In allosteric proteins, binding a ligand can affect function at a distant location, for example by changing the binding affinity of a substrate at the active site. The induced fit and population shift models, which differ by the assumed number of stable configurations, explain such cooperative binding from a thermodynamic viewpoint. Yet, understanding what mechanical principles constrain these models remains a challenge. Here we provide an empirical study on 34 proteins supporting the idea that allosteric conformational change generally occurs along a soft elastic mode presenting extended regions of high shear. We argue, based on a detailed analysis of how the energy profile along such a mode depends on binding, that in the induced fit scenario there is an optimal stiffness [Formula] for cooperative binding, where N is the number of residues involved in the allosteric response. We find that the population shift scenario is more robust to mutation affecting stiffness, as binding becomes more and more cooperative with stiffness up to the same characteristic value [Formula], beyond which cooperativity saturates instead of decaying. We confirm numerically these findings in a non-linear mechanical model. Dynamical considerations suggest that a stiffness of order [Formula] is favorable in that scenario as well, supporting that for proper function proteins must evolve a functional elastic mode that is softer as their size increases. In consistency with this view, we find a significant anticorrelation between the stiffness of the allosteric response and protein size in our data set.",

Here we show that the endocrine signaling attributed to the somatic aging pathways in C. elegans adults lacking a functional germline also regulate the reproductive phenotypes of adults that have experienced dauer as a result of early life starvation. Postdauer adults modulate their fatty acid metabolism in order to re-allocate fat reserves in a manner benefitting their progeny at the expense of the parental somatic fat reservoir. Our results also show that the metabolic plasticity in postdauer animals and the inheritance of ancestral starvation memory in the progeny are a result of crosstalk between somatic and reproductive tissues mediated by the HRDE-1 nuclear RNAi Argonaute.",

    "abstract": "Crossover (CO) recombination is essential for chromosome segregation during meiosis I. The number and distribution of COs are tightly regulated during meiosis. CO control includes CO assurance and CO interference, which guarantee at least one CO per a bivalent and evenly-spaced CO distribution, respectively. Previous studies showed the role of DNA damage response (DDR) clamp and its loader in efficient formation of meiotic COs by promoting the recruitment of a pro-CO protein Zip3 and interhomolog recombination, and also by suppressing ectopic recombination. In this study, by classical tetrad analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we showed that a mutant defective in the RAD24 gene (RAD17 in other organisms), which encodes the DDR clamp loader, displayed reduced CO frequencies on two shorter chromosomes (III and V) but not on a long chromosome (chromosome VII). The residual COs in the rad24 mutant do not show interference. In contrast to the rad24 mutant, mutants defective in the ATR kinase homolog Mec1/Esr1, including a mec1 null and a mec1 kinase-dead mutant, show little or no defect in CO frequency. On the other hand, mec1 COs show defects in interference, similar to the rad24 mutant. Moreover, CO formation and its control are implemented in a chromosome-specific manner, which may reflect a role for chromosome size in regulation.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (eCIRP) is a recently-discovered damage-associated molecular pattern. Understanding the precise mechanism by which it exacerbates inflammation in sepsis is essential. Here we identified that eCIRP is a new biologically active endogenous ligand of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1), fueling inflammation in sepsis and ischemia-reperfusion. Surface plasmon resonance revealed a strong binding affinity between eCIRP and TREM-1, and FRET assay confirmed eCIRPs interaction with TREM-1 in macrophages. TREM-1 inhibition, either by its siRNA or a decoy peptide LP17, dramatically reduced eCIRP-induced inflammation. We developed a novel 7-aa peptide derived from human eCIRP, M3, which blocked the interaction of TREM-1 and eCIRP. M3 suppressed inflammation induced by eCIRP or agonist TREM-1 Ab crosslinking in murine macrophages or human peripheral blood monocytes. M3 also inhibited eCIRP-induced systemic inflammation and tissue injury. Treatment with M3 further protected mice from sepsis and intestinal ischemia-reperfusion, improved acute lung injury, and increased survival. Thus, we have discovered a novel TREM-1 ligand and developed a new peptide M3 to block eCIRP-TREM-1 interaction and improve the outcome of sepsis and sterile inflammation.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally and control biological processes, including fibrogenesis. Kidney fibrosis remains a clinical challenge and miRNAs may represent a valid therapeutic avenue. We show that miR-9-5p protected from renal fibrosis in the mouse model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). This was reflected in reduced expression of pro-fibrotic markers, decreased number of infiltrating monocytes/macrophages and diminished tubular epithelial cell injury and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-{beta}1)-dependent de-differentiation in human kidney proximal tubular (HKC-8) cells. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) studies in the UUO model revealed that this protection was mediated by a global shift in the expression profile of genes related to key metabolic pathways, including mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and glycolysis, preventing their UUO-dependent down-regulation. This effect was mirrored by a prevention in the TGF-{beta}1-induced bioenergetics changes in HKC-8 cells. The expression of the FAO-related axis peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1)-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR) was reduced by UUO, although preserved by the administration of miR-9-5p. We found that in mice null for the mitochondrial master regulator PGC-1, miR-9-5p was unable to promote a protective effect in the UUO model. We propose that miR-9-5p elicits a protective response to chronic kidney injury and renal fibrosis by inducing reprogramming of the metabolic derangement and mitochondrial dysfunction affecting tubular epithelial cells.",

The beauty and simplicity of the motif gives hope to detecting coiled-coil regions with reasonable accuracy and precision in any protein sequence. Here, we re-evaluated the most commonly used coiled-coil prediction tools with respect to the most comprehensive reference data set available, the entire Protein Data Base (PDB), down to each amino acid and its secondary structure. Apart from the thirtyfold difference in number of predicted coiled-coils the tools strongly vary in their predictions, across structures and within structures. The evaluation of the false discovery rate and Matthews correlation coefficient, a widely used performance metric for imbalanced data sets, suggests that the tested tools have only limited applicability for large data sets. Coiled-coil predictions strongly impact the functional characterization of proteins, are used for functional genome annotation, and should therefore be supported and validated by additional information.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the diversity, abundance and structure of the pentatomid bugs community during the soybean and corn off-season in Andropogon bicornis L. (Poales, Poaceae) plants. The experiment was carried out in the municipality of Cruz Alta, RS, Brazil. During the soybean and corn off-season from 2014 to 2018, clumps of 10 to 50 centimeters in diameter were observed around the growing area. Data on the number of species and abundance of individuals were used for statistical analysis (ANOVA, linear regression and Pearson correlation) and faunistic (diversity and abundance distribution). At the end of the experiment 4050 adults belonging to the species Euschistus heros (F.), Dichelops furcatus (F.), Dichelops melacanthus (Dallas), Edessa meditabunda (F.), Edessa ruformaginata (De Geer) and Piezodorus guildini. Among the species, we found greater abundance for E. meditabunda, E. heros and D. furcatus (96.07%) of the individuals sampled. Higher interspecific correlation was observed between the same species, we also observed a direct effect of the clump diameter on the population density. Among the six species observed, at least five are economically important for soybean and corn crops, so further studies are needed in order to verify the effects of this hibernation site on the population present in the crop and its damages.",

    "abstract": "Intimate ecological interactions, such as those between parasites and their hosts, may persist over long time spans, coupling the evolutionary histories of the lineages involved. Most methods that reconstruct the coevolutionary history of such associations make the simplifying assumption that parasites have a single host. Many methods also focus on congruence between host and parasite phylogenies, using cospeciation as the null model. However, there is an increasing body of evidence suggesting that the host ranges of parasites are more complex: that host ranges often include more than one host and evolve via gains and losses of hosts rather than through cospeciation alone. Here, we develop a Bayesian approach for inferring coevolutionary history based on a model accommodating these complexities. Specifically, a parasite is assumed to have a host repertoire, which includes both potential hosts and one or more actual hosts. Over time, potential hosts can be added or lost, and potential hosts can develop into actual hosts or vice versa. Thus, host colonization is modeled as a two-step process, which may potentially be influenced by host relatedness or host traits. We first explore the statistical behavior of our model by simulating evolution of host-parasite interactions under a range of parameters. We then use our approach, implemented in the program RevBayes, to infer the coevolutionary history between 34 Nymphalini butterfly species and 25 angiosperm families.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing and severe public health threat of viruses of the family Flaviviridae, including dengue, hepatitis C, West Nile, yellow fever, and zika, demand a greater understanding of how these viruses evolve, emerge and spread in order to respond. Central to this understanding is an updated phylogeny of the entire family. Unfortunately, most cladograms of Flaviviridae focus on specific lineages, ignore outgroups, and rely on midpoint rooting, hampering their ability to test ingroup monophyly and estimate ingroup relationships. This problem is partly due to the lack of fully annotated genomes of Flaviviridae, which has genera with slightly different gene content, hindering genome analysis without partitioning. To tackle these problems, we developed an annotation pipeline for Flaviviridae that uses a combination of ab initio and homology-based strategies. The pipeline recovered 100% of the genes in reference genomes and annotated over 97% of the expected genes in the remaining non curated sequences. We further demonstrate that the combined analysis of genomes of all genera of Flaviviridae (Flavivirus, Hepacivirus, Pegivirus, and Pestivirus), as made possible by our annotation strategy, enhances the phylogenetic analyses of these viruses for all optimality criteria that we tested (parsimony, maximum likelihood, and posterior probability). The final tree sheds light on the phylogenetic relationship of viruses that are divergent from most Flaviviridae and should be reclassified, especially the soybean cyst nematode virus 5 (SbCNV-5) and the Tamana bat virus. We also corroborate the close phylogenetic relationship of dengue and zika viruses with an unprecedented degree of support.",

Here we report that the soil bacteria Pseudomonas vranovensis is a natural pathogen of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and that parental exposure of animals to P. vranovensis promotes offspring resistance to infection. Furthermore, we demonstrate a transgenerational enhancement of progeny survival when three consecutive generations of animals are exposed to P. vranovensis. By investigating the mechanisms by which animals heritably adapt to P. vranovensis infection, we found that parental infection by P. vranovensis results in increased expression of the cysteine synthases CYSL-1 and CYSL-2 and the regulator of hypoxia inducible factor RHY-1 in progeny and that these three genes are required for adaptation to P. vranovensis. To our knowledge, these observations represent the largest heritable increase in offspring survival in response to a pathogen infection reported in any organism to date and establish a new CYSL-1, CYSL-2, and RHY-1 dependent mechanism by which animals adapt to infection.",

P. aeruginosa is often present in the gastrointestinal tract, and indole from commensal bacteria such as Escherichia coli has been shown to inhibit P. aeruginosa quorum sensing and pathogenicity without influencing growth. Furthermore, indole is not toxic to P. aeruginosa persister cells. However, we find here that physiological concentrations of indole inhibit P. aeruginosa persister cell resuscitation with an efficiency of higher than 95%. Critically, when contacted with E. coli stationary phase cultures, the indole produced by E. coli completely inhibits persister cell resuscitation of P. aeruginosa.\\n\\nConclusionsTherefore, E. col has devised a method to outcompete its competitors by preventing their resuscitation with indole.\\n\\nSignificanceThis work provides insight into why indole is produced by commensal bacteria.",

These transcriptomic clusters differentially express a rich repertoire of neuropeptides, receptors, ion channels, and transcription factors. We generated novel intersectional viral-genetic tools to access specific subpopulations.

These interneurons are synapse with upstream neurons such as the mechanoreceptor-expressing ASG. Ca2+ imaging revealed that ASG responsiveness to temperature change via mechanoreceptor DEG-1, a Degenerin/Epithelial Sodium Channel (DEG/ENaC), affects downstream AIN and AVJ circuits. Ectopic expression of DEG-1 in the ASE gustatory neuron resulted in acquisition of thermosensitivity, while electrophysiological analysis revealed that DEG-1 was involved in temperature sensation. Together, these results suggest that cold tolerance is regulated by mechanoreceptor-mediated circuit calculation.",

If resident microbes could be found to exhibit consistent patterns between the mouth and gut, disease status could potentially be assessed non-invasively through profiling of oral samples. Currently, there exists no generally applicable method to test for such associations. Here we present a Bayesian framework to identify microbes that exhibit consistent patterns between body sites, with respect to a phenotypic variable. For a given operational taxonomic unit (OTU), a Bayesian regression model is used to obtain Markov-Chain Monte Carlo estimates of abundance among strata, calculate a correlation statistic, and conduct a formal test based on its posterior distribution. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate overall viability of the approach, and provide information on what factors affect its performance. Applying our method to a dataset containing oral and gut microbiome samples from 77 pancreatic cancer patients revealed several OTUs exhibiting consistent patterns between gut and mouth with respect to disease subtype. Our method is well powered for modest sample sizes and moderate strength of association and can be flexibly extended to other research settings using any currently established Bayesian analysis programs.",

    "abstract": "Marine microbial primary production is influenced by the availability and uptake of essential nutrients, including iron. Although marine microbes have evolved mechanisms to scavenge sub-nanomolar concentrations of iron, recent observations suggest that viruses may co-opt these very same mechanisms to facilitate infection. The \\\"Ferrojan Horse Hypothesis\\\" proposes that viruses incorporate iron atoms into their tail fiber proteins to adsorb to target host receptors. Here, we propose an evolutionary game theoretic approach to consider the joint strategies of hosts and viruses in environments with limited nutrients (like iron). We analyze the bimatrix game and find that evolutionarily stable strategies depend on the stability and quality of nutrient conditions. For example, in highly stable iron conditions, virus pressure does not change host uptake strategies. However, when iron levels are dynamic, virus pressure can lead to fluctuations in the extent to which hosts invest in metabolic machinery that increases both iron uptake and susceptibility to viral infection. Altogether, this evolutionary game model provides further evidence that viral infection and nutrient dynamics jointly shape the fate of microbial populations.",

    "abstract": "Robust inference of causal relationships between gene expression and complex traits using Mendelian Randomization (MR) approaches is confounded by pleiotropy and linkage disequilibrium (LD) between gene expression quantitative loci (eQTLs). Here we propose a new MR method, MR-link, that accounts for unobserved pleiotropy and LD by leveraging information from individual-level data. In simulations, MR-link shows false positive rates close to expectation (median 0.05) and high power (up to 0.89), outperforming all other MR methods we tested, even when only one eQTL variant is present. Application of MR-link to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) measurements in 12,449 individuals and eQTLs summary statistics from whole blood and liver identified 19 genes causally linked to LDL-C. These include the previously functionally validated SORT1 gene, and the PVRL2 gene, located in the APOE locus, for which a causal role in liver was yet unknown. Our results showcase the strength of MR-link for transcriptome-wide causal inferences.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of pyrazinamide (PZA) in the tuberculosis drug regimen shortened treatment from 12 to 6 months 1. PZA is a prodrug that is activated by a Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) amidase to release its bioactive component pyrazinoic acid (POA) 2. Aspartate decarboxylase PanD, a proenzyme activated by autocatalytic cleavage (Supplementary Fig. 1A, 3) and required for Coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis, emerged as a target of POA 4-7. In vitro and in vivo screening to isolate spontaneous POA-resistant Mtb mutants identified missense mutations in either panD or the unfoldase clpC1, encoding a component of the caseinolytic protease ClpC1-ClpP 4,6-9. Overexpression and binding studies of PanD or ClpC1 pointed to PanD as the direct target of POA whereas clpC1 mutations appeared to indirectly cause resistance 4,5,7,9,10. Indeed, supplementing growth media with CoA precursors downstream of the PanD catalyzed step conferred POA resistance 4,7,11. Metabolomic analyses and biophysical studies using recombinant proteins confirmed targeting of PanD by POA 5. However, the exact molecular mechanism of PanD inhibition by POA remained unknown. While most drugs act by inhibiting protein function upon target binding, we show here that POA is not a bona fide enzyme inhibitor. Rather, POA binding to PanD triggers degradation of the protein by ClpC1-ClpP. Thus, the old tuberculosis drug PZA promotes degradation of its target. While novel for an antibacterial, drug-induced target degradation has recently emerged as a strategy in drug discovery across disease indications. Our findings provide the basis for the rational discovery of next generation PZA.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveBrain atrophy is an established biomarker for dementia, yet spinal cord involvement has not been investigated to date. As the spinal cord is relaying sensorimotor control signals from the cortex to the peripheral nervous system and viceversa, it is indeed a very interesting question to assess whether it is affected by atrophy in a disease that is known for its involvement of cognitive domains first and foremost, with motor symptoms being clinically assessed too. We therefore hypothesize that Alzheimer Disease severe atrophy can affect the spinal cord too and that spinal cord atrophy is indeed an important in vivo imaging biomarker contributing to understanding neurodegeneration associated with dementia.\\n\\nMethods3DT1 images of 31 Alzheimers disease (AD) and 35 healthy control (HC) subjects were processed to calculate volumes of brain structures and cross-sectional area (CSA) and volume (CSV) of the cervical cord (per vertebra as well as the C2-C3 pair (CSA23 and CSV23)). Correlated features ({rho}>0.7) were removed, and best subset identified for patients classification with the Random Forest algorithm. General linear model regression was used to find significant differences between groups (p<=0.05). Linear regression was implemented to assess the explained variance of the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score as dependent variable with best features as predictors.\\n\\nResultsSpinal cord features were significantly reduced in AD, independently of brain volumes. Patients classification reached 76% accuracy when including CSA23 together with volumes of hippocampi, left amygdala, white and grey matter, with 74% sensitivity and 78% specificity. CSA23 alone explained 13% of MMSE variance.\\n\\nDiscussionOur findings reveal that C2-C3 spinal cord atrophy contributes to discriminate AD from HC, together with more established features. Results show that CSA23, calculated form the same 3DT1 scan as all other brain volumes (including right and left hippocampi), has a considerable weight in classification tasks warranting further investigations. Together with recent studies revealing that AD atrophy is spread beyond the temporal lobes, our result adds the spinal cord to a number of unsuspected regions involved in the disease. Interestingly, spinal cord atrophy explains also cognitive scores, which could significantly impact how we model sensorimotor control in degenerative diseases with a primary cognitive domain involvement. Prospective studies should be purposely designed to understand the mechanisms of atrophy and the role of the spinal cord in AD.",

In the case of biological networks they help in predicting the evolution and history of biomolecule interactions, provided we map properly real networks into the corresponding graph models. In this paper, we show that for biological graph models many of the existing parameter estimation techniques overlook the critical property of graph symmetry (also known formally as graph automorphisms), thus the estimated parameters give statistically insignificant results concerning the observed network. To demonstrate it and to develop accurate estimation procedures, we focus on the biologically inspired duplication-divergence model, and the up-to-date data of protein-protein interactions of seven species including human and yeast. Using exact recurrence relations of some prominent graph statistics, we devise a parameter estimation technique that provides the right order of symmetries and uses phylogenetically old proteins as the choice of seed graph nodes. We also find that our results are consistent with the ones obtained from maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). However, the MLE approach is significantly slower than our methods in practice.",

    "abstract": "Existing methods to detect domestic triatomines have low sensitivity. As early house infestation detection is epidemiologically important, the exploration of better methods is required. Hence, we measured the attractiveness of a yeast-baited trap to adults and nymphs of Triatoma infestans, under laboratory conditions.\\n\\nThe assays were conducted in an experimental arena, with an experimental and a control traps placed at opposite sides and one refuge in the center area. Insects where released and the number of triatomines in the yeast and control traps were counted, after 3, 6 and 24 hours of the beginning of the experiment. We use generalized linear models within a multimodel inference approach to model the number of insects in the trap, using insect age classes, time after assay initiation and date of the experiment as predictors.\\n\\nOur results show that the attraction to CO2 depends upon the life stage of the insects. During the 24 hours of experiment a constant number of adults were attracted to the yeast trap, while nymphs show attraction only up to the first three hours after the initiation of CO2 liberation. Undoubtedly, the orientation response to chemical cues deserves further studies to be fully understood.",

    "abstract": "Antagonistic functions of Polycomb and Trithorax proteins are essential for proper development of all metazoans. While the Polycomb proteins maintain the repressed state of key developmental genes, the Trithorax proteins ensure that these genes stay active in cells where they have to be expressed. Ash1 is the Trithorax protein that was proposed to counteract Polycomb repression by methylating lysine 36 of histone H3. However, recently it was shown that genetic replacement of Drosophila histone H3 with the variant that carried Arginine instead of Lysine at position 36 did not impair the ability of Ash1 to counteract Polycomb repression. This argues that Ash1 counteracts Polycomb repression by methylating, yet unknown, non-histone proteins. To find these substrates, one may need to look beyond the function of the Ash1 histone methyltransferase SET domain at other evolutionary conserved parts of the protein that received little attention. Here we used Drosophila genetics to demonstrate that Ash1 requires each of the BAH, PHD and SET domains to counteract Polycomb repression, while AT hooks are dispensable. Our findings argue that, in vivo, Ash1 acts as a multimer. Thereby, it can combine the input of the SET domain and PHD-BAH cassette residing in different peptides. Finally, using new loss of function alleles, we show that zygotic Ash1 is required to prevent erroneous repression of homeotic genes.",

    "abstract": "Acetylcholine in the neocortex is critical for executive function. Degeneration of the basal forebrain cholinergic system is associated with cognitive decline in aging and Alzheimers disease. Cholinergic agonists and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors improve cognitive performance as does intermittent electrical stimulation of the cortical source of acetylcholine, the Nucleus Basalis (NB) of Meynert. Here we tested how NB stimulation improves working memory behavior and alters its neural code. NB stimulation increased dorsolateral prefrontal activity during the delay period of working memory tasks but did not strengthen phasic responses to the optimal visual stimulus of each neuron. Unexpectedly, improvement of behavioral performance was not the result of increased neural selectivity. Tuning of neuronal responses broadened, which rendered an attractor network more stable and filtered distracting visual stimuli more effectively. Thus, the effects of acetylcholine on prefrontal neural activity and selectivity in working memory contrast those of dopamine and stabilize neural ensembles based on neuromodulatory tone.",
