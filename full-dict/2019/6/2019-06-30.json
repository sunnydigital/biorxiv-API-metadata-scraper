    "abstract": "The speed of muscle contraction is related to body size; muscles in larger species contract at a slower rate. We investigated the evolution of twelve myosin II isoforms to identify any adapted to increasing body mass in mammals. We identified a correlation between body mass and sequence divergence for the motor domain of three adult myosin II isoforms ({beta}, 2A, 2B) suggesting that these isoforms have adapted to increasing body mass. In contrast the non-muscle and developmental isoforms show no correlation of sequence divergence with body mass, while the sarcomeric myosin 7b, extraocular and 2X isoforms showed a divergence intermediate between these two groups. The 2B and {beta}-myosin motor domain showed the greatest rate of sequence divergence (-0.84 and -0.69 % per ten-fold increase in mass respectively). {beta}-myosin is abundant in cardiac ventricle and slow skeletal muscle. We propose that {beta}-myosin has adapted to enable slower heart beating and contraction of slow skeletal muscle as body mass increased.",

    "abstract": "Mapping the reports of awareness and its neural underpinnings is instrumental to understand the limits of human perception. The capacity to become aware of objects in the world may be studied by suppressing faint target stimuli with strong masking stimuli, or - alternatively - by manipulating the level of wakefulness from full alertness to mild drowsiness. By combining these two approaches, we studied how perceptual awareness is modulated by decreasing wakefulness. We found dynamic changes in behavioural and neural signatures of conscious access in humans between awake and drowsy states. Behaviourally, we show a decrease in the steepness of the psychophysical function for conscious access in drowsy trials. Neural mapping showed delayed processing of target-mask interaction as the consciousness transition progressed, suggesting that the brain resolution of conscious access shifts from early sensory/perceptual to decision-making stages of processing. Once the goal to report the awareness of a target is set, the system behaviourally adapts to rapid changes in wakefulness, revealing the flexibility of the neural signatures of conscious access, and its suppression, to maintain performance.\n\nSignificance statementMaintaining full alertness for long periods of time in attentionally demanding situations is challenging and may lead to a decrease in performance. We show the effect of wakefulness fluctuations on behaviour and brain dynamics that humans use to maintain performance. We reveal the neural strategies we have to cope with drowsiness by shifting the weights to more flexible brain processes and relaxing the precision of the decisions we take.",

    "abstract": "In several species, Piwi/piRNA genome silencing defects lead to immediate sterility accompanied by heterochromatin dysfunction and transposon-induced genomic instability, which may cause Piwi mutant sterility. In C. elegans, Piwi pathway mutants transmit a heritable stress through germ cells that induces sterility after growth for several generations. We found that sterile Piwi pathway mutant germ cells displayed inconsistent increases in DNA damage but consistently altered perinuclear germ granules that are known to promote fertility. Germ granule dysfunction did not elicit transposon expression but was sufficient to induce multiple phenotypes found in sterile Piwi silencing mutants, including germline atrophy and regrowth. Furthermore, loss of the germ granule component PGL-1 accelerated sterility in response to deficiency for prg-1/Piwi. Restoration of germ granule function to sterile pgl-1 mutants restored their fertility. Together, our results suggest that germ granule defects may promote an adult reproductive arrest phenotype that is responsible for Piwi/piRNA mutant sterility.",

    "abstract": "Nervous system maturation occurs on multiple levels, synaptic, circuit, and network, at divergent time scales. For example, many synaptic properties mature gradually, while emergent network dynamics, as data show, change abruptly. Here, we combine experimental and theoretical approaches to investigate a sudden transition in spontaneous thalamocortical activity necessary for the development of vision. Inspired by in vivo measurements of time-scales and amplitudes of synaptic currents, we extend the Wilson and Cowan model to take into account the relative onset timing and amplitudes of inhibitory and excitatory neural population responses. We study the dynamics of this system and identify the bifurcations as the onset timescales of excitation and inhibition are varied. We focus on the specific typical developmental changes in synaptic timescales consistent with the experimental observations. These findings argue that the inhibitory timing is a critical determinant of thalamocortical activity maturation; a gradual decay of the ratio of inhibitory to excitatory onset time below one drives the system through a bifurcation that leads to a sudden switch of the network spontaneous activity from high-amplitude oscillations to a non-oscillatory active state. This switch also drives a marked change to a linear network response to transient stimuli, agreeing to the in vivo observations. The switch observed in the model is representative of the sudden transition in the sensory cortical activity seen early in development.",

    "abstract": "The ability of some microorganisms to switch from respiration to fermentation in the presence of oxygen-the so-called Crabtree effect-has been a fascinating subject of study at the theoretical and experimental fronts. Game-theoretical approaches have been routinely used to examine and explain the way a microorganism, such as yeast, would switch between the two ATP-producing pathways, i.e., respiration and fermentation. Here we attempt to explain the switch between respiration and fermentation in yeast by constructing a simple metabolic switch. We then utilise an individual-based model, in which each individual is equipped with all the relevant chemical reactions, to see how cells equipped with such metabolic switch would behave in different conditions. We further investigate our proposed metabolic switch using the game-theoretical approach. Based on this model, we postulate that individuals play a mixed game of glucose metabolism in the population. This approach not only sheds some light in the varieties of metabolic regulations that can be utilised by the individual in the population in competition with others for a common resource, it would also allow a better understanding of the causes of the Warburg effect and similar phenomena observed in nature.",

    "abstract": "The vast variation in floral traits at a macroevolutionary level is often interpreted as the result of adaptation to pollinators. However, studies in wild populations often find no evidence of pollinator-mediated selection on flowers. Evolutionary theory predicts this could be the outcome of long periods of stasis under stable conditions, followed by shorter periods of pollinator change that provide selection for innovative phenotypes. We asked if periods of stasis are caused by stabilizing selection, absence of other forms of selection on floral traits, or by low trait ability to respond even if selection is present. We studied Ulex parviflorus, a plant predominantly pollinated by one bee species across its range. We measured heritability and evolvability of floral traits, using genome-wide molecular relatedness in a large wild population, and combined this with estimates of selection on the same individuals. We found evidence for both stabilizing selection and low trait heritability as explanations for stasis in flowers. The area of the standard petal is under stabilizing selection, but the variability observed in the wild is not heritable. A separate trait, floral weight, in turn presents high heritability, but is not currently under selection. We show how a stable environment can lead to a lack of evolutionary change, yet maintain heritable variation to respond to future selection pressures.",

    "abstract": "Sequential sampling models such as the drift diffusion model have a long tradition in research on perceptual decision-making, but mounting evidence suggests that these models can account for response time distributions that arise during reinforcement learning and value-based decision-making. Building on this previous work, we implemented the drift diffusion model as the choice rule in inter-temporal choice (temporal discounting) and risky choice (probability discounting) using a hierarchical Bayesian estimation scheme. We validated our approach in data from nine patients with focal lesions to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex / medial orbitofrontal cortex (vmPFC/mOFC) and nineteen age- and education-matched controls. Choice model parameters estimated via standard softmax action selection were reliably reproduced using the drift diffusion model as the choice rule, both for temporal discounting and risky choice. Model comparison revealed that, for both tasks, the data were best accounted for by a variant of the drift diffusion model including a non-linear mapping from value-differences to trial-wise drift rates. Posterior predictive checks of the winning models revealed a reasonably good fit to individual participants reaction time distributions. We then applied this modeling framework and 1) reproduced our previous results regarding temporal discounting in vmPFC/mOFC patients and 2) showed in a previously unpublished data set on risky choice that vmPFC/mOFC patients exhibit increased risk-taking relative to controls. Analyses of diffusion model parameters revealed that vmPFC/mOFC damage abolished neither value sensitivity nor asymptote of the drift rate. Rather, it substantially increased non-decision times and reduced response caution during risky choice. Our results highlight that novel insights can be gained from applying sequential sampling models in studies of inter-temporal and risky decision-making in cognitive neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "Peroxiredoxins are H2O2 scavenging enzymes that also carry H2O2 signaling and chaperone functions. In yeast, the major cytosolic peroxiredoxin, Tsa1 is required for both promoting resistance to H2O2 and extending lifespan upon caloric restriction. We show here that Tsa1 effects both these functions not by scavenging H2O2, but by repressing the nutrient signaling Ras-cAMP-PKA pathway at the level of the protein kinase A (PKA) enzyme. Tsa1 stimulates sulfenylation of cysteines in the PKA catalytic subunit by H2O2 and a significant proportion of the catalytic subunits are glutathionylated on two cysteine residues. Redox modification of the conserved Cys243 inhibits the phosphorylation of a conserved Thr241 in the kinase activation loop and enzyme activity, and preventing Thr241 phosphorylation can overcome the H2O2 sensitivity of Tsa1-deficient cells. Results support a model of aging where nutrient signaling pathways constitute hubs integrating information from multiple aging-related conduits, including a peroxiredoxin-dependent response to H2O2.",

    "abstract": "The FRIGIDA locus (FRI, AT4G00650) has been extensively studied in Arabidopsis thaliana because of its role creating flowering time diversity. The FRI protein regulates flowering induction by binding partner proteins on its N- and C-terminus domains and creating a supercomplex that promotes transcription of the floral repressor FLC. Despite the knowledge accumulated on FRI, the function of the highly conserved central domain of the protein is still unknown. Functional characterization of naturally occurring DNA polymorphisms can provide useful information about the role of a protein and the localization of its operative domains. In the case of FRI, deleterious mutations are positively selected and widespread in nature, making them a powerful tool to study the function of the different domains of the protein. Here we explore natural sequence variation in the FRI locus in more than 1000 Arabidopsis accessions. We identify new mutations predicted to compromise the function of the protein and confirm our predictions by cloning 22 different alleles of FRI and expressing them in a common null genetic background. Our analysis allows us to pinpoint two single amino acid changes in the central domain that render the protein non-functional. We show that these two mutations determine the stability and cellular localization of the FRI protein. In summary, our work makes use of natural variants at the FRI locus to help understanding the function of the central domain of the FRI protein.",

Here we develop a temporal model for these unobserved molecular changes with a manifold learning method applied to RNA-Seq data collected from human postmortem brain samples collected within the ROS/MAP and Mayo Clinic RNA-Seq studies. We define an ordering across samples based on their similarity in gene expression and use this ordering to estimate the molecular disease stage - or disease pseudotime - for each sample. Disease pseudotime is strongly concordant with the burden of tau (Braak score, P = 1.0x10-5), A{beta} (CERAD score, P = 1.8x10-5), and cognitive diagnosis (P = 3.5x10-7) of LOAD. Early stage disease pseudotime samples are enriched for controls and show changes in basic cellular functions. Late stage disease pseudotime samples are enriched for late stage AD cases and show changes in neuroinflammation and amyloid pathologic processes. We also identify a set of late stage pseudotime samples that are controls and show changes in genes enriched for protein trafficking, splicing, regulation of apoptosis, and prevention of amyloid cleavage pathways. In summary, we present a method for ordering patients along a trajectory of LOAD disease progression from brain transcriptomic data.",

    "abstract": "The two catecholamines, noradrenaline and dopamine, have been shown to play comparable roles in behaviour. Both noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurons respond to salient cues predicting reward availability and to stimulus novelty, and shape action selection strategies. However, their roles in motivation have seldom been directly compared. We therefore examined the activity of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus and putative midbrain dopaminergic neurons in monkeys cued to perform effortful actions for rewards. The activity in both regions correlated with the likelihood of engaging with a presented option. By contrast, only noradrenaline neurons were also (i) predictive of engagement in a subsequent trial following a failure to engage and (ii) sensitive to the task state change, the discovery of the new task condition in unrepeated trials. This indicates that while dopamine is primarily important for the promotion of actions directed towards currently available rewards, noradrenergic neurons play a crucial complementary role in mobilizing resources to promote future engagement.",

The E3 ligase Ltn1 adds ubiquitin and Rqc2 directs the large ribosomal subunit to append carboxy-terminal alanine and threonine residues (CAT tails). When excessive amounts of incomplete polypeptides evade Ltn1, CAT-tailed proteins accumulate and can self-associate into aggregates. CAT tail aggregation has been hypothesized to either protect cells by sequestering potentially toxic incomplete polypeptides or harm cells by disrupting protein homeostasis. To distinguish between these possibilities, we modulated CAT tail aggregation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae with genetic and chemical tools to analyze CAT tails in aggregated and un-aggregated states. We found that enhancing CAT tail aggregation induces proteotoxic stress and antagonizes degradation of CAT-tailed proteins, while inhibiting aggregation reverses these effects. Our findings suggest that CAT tail aggregation harms RQC-compromised cells and that preventing aggregation can mitigate this toxicity.",

Frustration is thought to underpin biomolecular recognition and the flexibility of protein binding sites. Here we show how a small chemical modification, the oxidation of two cysteine thiols to a disulfide bond, during the catalytic cycle of the N-terminal domain of the key bacterial oxidoreductase DsbD (nDsbD), introduces frustration ultimately influencing protein function. In oxidized nDsbD, local frustration disrupts the packing of the protective cap-loop region against the active site allowing loop opening. By contrast, in reduced nDsbD the cap loop is rigid, always protecting the active-site thiols from the oxidizing environment of the periplasm. Our results point towards an intricate coupling between the dynamics of the active-site cysteines and of the cap loop which modulates the association reactions of nDsbD with its partners resulting in optimized protein function.",

Generally, the footprint and weight of open-source miniscopes is sacrificed for added functionality. Here, we present NINscope: a light-weight, small footprint, open-source miniscope that incorporates a high-sensitivity image sensor, an inertial measurement unit (IMU), and an LED driver for an external optogenetic probe. We highlight the advantages of NINscope by performing the first simultaneous cellular resolution (dual scope) recordings from cerebellum and cerebral cortex in unrestrained mice, revealing that the activity of both regions generally precedes the onset of behavioral acceleration. We further demonstrate the optogenetic stimulation capabilities of NINscope and show that cerebral cortical activity can be driven strongly by cerebellar stimulation. To validate the performance of our miniscope to image from deep-brain regions, we recorded in the dorsal striatum and, using the IMU to assess turning movements, replicate previous studies that show encoding of action space in this subcortical region. Finally, we combine optogenetic stimulation of distinct cortical regions projecting to the dorsal striatum, to probe functional connectivity. In combination with cross-platform control software, NINscope is a versatile addition to the expanding toolbox of open-source miniscopes and will aid multi-region circuit investigations during unrestrained behavior.",

    "abstract": "We develop a method for solving mathematical models of messenger RNA (mRNA) translation based on the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP). Our main goal is to demonstrate that the method is versatile and applicable to realistic models of translation. To this end we consider the TASEP with codon-dependent elongation rates, premature termination due to ribosome drop-off and translation reinitiation due to circularisation of the mRNA. We apply the method to the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae under physiological conditions and find excellent agreements with the results of stochastic simulations. Our findings suggest that the common view on translation as being rate-limited by initiation is oversimplistic. Instead we find theoretical evidence for ribosome interference and also theoretical support for the ramp hypothesis which argues that codons at the beginning of genes have slower elongation rates in order to reduce ribosome density and jamming.",

    "abstract": "PurposeMitraClip is the sole percutaneous device approved for functional mitral regurgitation (MR; FMR) but MR recurs in over one third of patients. As device-induced mechanical effects are a potential cause for MR recurrence, we tested the hypothesis that MitraClip increases leaflet stress and procedure-related strain in sub-valvular left ventricular (LV) myocardium in FMR associated with coronary disease (FMR-CAD).\\n\\nMethodsSimulations were performed using finite element models of the LV + mitral valve based on MRI of 5 sheep with FMR-CAD. Models were modified to have a 20% increase in LV volume ({uparrow}LV_VOLUME) and MitraClip was simulated with contracting beam elements (virtual sutures) placed between nodes in the center edge of the anterior (AL) and posterior (PL) mitral leaflets. Effects of MitraClip on leaflet stress in the peri-MitraClip region of AL and PL, septo-lateral annular diameter (SLAD), and procedure-related radial strain (Err) in the sub-valvular myocardium were calculated.\\n\\nResultsMitraClip increased peri-MitraClip leaflet stress at end-diastole (ED) by 22.3{+/-}7.1 kPa (p<0.0001) in AL and 14.8{+/-}1.2 kPa (p<0.0001) in PL. MitraClip decreased SLAD by 6.1{+/-}2.2 mm (p<0.0001) and increased Err in the sub-valvular lateral LV myocardium at ED by 0.09{+/-}0.04 (p<0.0001)). Furthermore, MitraClip in {uparrow}LV_VOLUME was associated with persistent effects at ED but also at end-systole where peri-MitraClip leaflet stress was increased in AL by 31.9{+/-}14.4 kPa (p=0.0268) and in PL by 22.5{+/-}23.7 kPa (p=0.0101).\\n\\nConclusionsMitraClip for FMR-CAD increases mitral leaflet stress and radial strain in LV sub-valvular myocardium.

Devices such as reconfigurable microvalves or implantable tissues have been created using lithography or casting techniques. Here, we present a novel open microfluidic patterning method that utilizes surface tension forces to pattern hydrogel layers on top of each other, producing 3D hydrogel structures. We use a patterning device to form a temporary open microfluidic channel on an existing gel layer, allowing the controlled flow of unpolymerized gel in regions defined by the device. Once the gel is polymerized, the patterning device can then be removed, and subsequent layers added to create a multi-layered 3D structure. The use of open-microfluidic and surface tension-based methods to define the shape of each layer enables patterning to be performed with a simple pipette, minimizing dead-volume and shear stress applied on the fluid. Our method is compatible with unmodified (native) biological hydrogels, or other non-biological materials with fluid properties compatible with capillary flow. With our open-microfluidic layer-by-layer fabrication method, we demonstrate the capability to build agarose and type I collagen structures featuring asymmetric designs, multiple components, overhanging features, and cell laden regions.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR screens are a powerful new technology for the identification of genome sequences that affect cellular phenotypes such as gene expression, survival, and proliferation. By tiling single-guide RNA (sgRNA) target sites across large genomic regions, CRISPR screens have the potential to systematically discovery novel functional sequences, however, a lack of purpose-built analysis tools limits the effectiveness of this approach. Here we describe RELICS, a Bayesian hierarchical model for the discovery of functional sequences from tiling CRISPR screens. RELICS considers the overlapping effects of multiple nearby functional sequences, accounts for the  area of effect surrounding sgRNA target sites, models overdispersion in sgRNA counts, combines information across multiple pools, and estimates the number of functional sequences supported by the data. In simulations, RELICS outperforms existing methods and provides higher resolution predictions. We apply RELICS to published CRISPR interference and CRISPR activation screens and predict novel regulatory sequences, several of which we experimentally validate. In summary, RELICS is a powerful new analysis method for tiling CRISPR screens that enables the discovery of functional sequences with unprecedented resolution and accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause serious persistent infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, sepsis, biofilm-related infections as in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Although CF lung infections can be treated with antibiotics, full clearance is difficult due to P. aeruginosa persistence. While antibiotic activity against growing P. aeruginosa is well documented, their activity against the non-growing persisters enriched in stationary phase cultures has not been well studied. Here, we systematically evaluated and ranked the six major classes of antibiotics, cell wall and cell membrane inhibitors, protein synthesis inhibitors, DNA synthesis inhibitors, RNA synthesis inhibitors, sulfa drugs, and nitrofurantoin, for their activity against both growing and persister forms of P. aeruginosa using colony forming count (CFU) and SYBR Green I/Propidium Iodide (PI) viability assay. Among the six major classes of antibiotics, cell wall and cell membrane inhibitors (Cefuroxime and Colistin), DNA synthesis inhibitors (Clinafloxacin) and sulfa drugs (Sulfamethoxazole) had good activity against stationary phase cells. In contrast, protein synthesis inhibitors (Gentamicin), RNA synthesis inhibitor (Rifampicin) and Nitrofurantoin had relatively poor activity against the stationary phase P. aeruginosa but relatively high activity against log phase P. aeruginosa. Clinafloxacin is the only single drug that could completely kill all (109 CFU) stationary phase cells in a 4 day drug exposure. The Cefuroxime + Gentamicin+ Clinafloxacin combination could kill all biofilm bacteria in 2 days whereas the clinically used drug combination Cefuroxime + Gentamicin + Colistin only partially killed the biofilm bacteria with 103 CFU remaining. In a murine persistent CF lung infection model, only Cefuroxime + Gentamicin+ Clinafloxacin cleared all bacteria in the infected lungs, whereas Clinafloxacin alone, or Cefuroxime + Clinafloxacin, or the current recommended drug combination Cefuroxime + Gentamicin, all failed to completely clear the bacterial load in the lungs. The complete sterilization of the bacterial load is a property of Clinafloxacin combination, as Cefuroxime + Gentamicin+ Levofloxacin combination was unable to clear the bacterial load in the lungs. Our findings demonstrate the importance of persister drug clinafloxacin, offer new therapeutic approaches for more effective treatment of persistent P. aeruginosa infections, and may have implications for treating other persistent infections.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimers disease (AD) and affects 1% of the population above 60 years old. Although PD commonly manifests with motor symptoms, a majority of patients with PD subsequently develop cognitive impairment which often progresses to dementia, a major cause of morbidity and disability. PD is characterized by -synuclein accumulation that frequently associates with amyloid beta (A{beta}) and tau fibrils, the hallmarks of AD neuropathologic changes; this co-occurrence suggests that onset of cognitive decline in PD may be associated with appearance of pathologic A{beta} and/or tau. Recent studies have highlighted the appearance of the soluble form of the Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2) receptor in CSF during development of AD. Given the known association of microglial activation with advancing PD, we investigated whether CSF and/or plasma sTREM2 increased with progression to PD dementia. We examined 165 participants consisting of 17 cognitively normal elderly, 45 PD patients with no cognitive impairment, 86 with mild cognitive impairment, and 17 with dementia. Stratification of subjects by CSF A{beta} and tau levels revealed that CSF sTREM2 concentrations were elevated in PD subgroups with abnormal tau, but not A{beta}, CSF concentration. These findings indicate that CSF sTREM2 could serve as a surrogate immune biomarker of neuronal injury in PD that is associated with cognitive decline.\\n\\nOne sentence summaryCSF sTREM2 correlates with CSF tau in PD",

    "abstract": "The anterior cingulate area (ACA) is an integral part of the prefrontal cortex in mice and has been implicated in several cognitive functions. Previous anatomical and functional imaging studies demonstrated that the ACA is highly interconnected with numerous brain regions acting as a hub region in functional networks. However, the importance of the ACA in regulating functional network activity and connectivity remains to be elucidated. Recently developed neuromodulatory techniques, such as Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) allow for precise control of neuronal activity. In this study, we used an inhibitory kappa-opioid receptor DREADDs (KORD) to temporally inhibit neuronal firing in the right ACA of mice and assessed functional network activity and connectivity using non-invasive functional MRI. We demonstrated that KORD-induced inhibition of the right ACA induced blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal decreases and increases in connected brain regions throughout of hemispheres. Furthermore, these modulations in neuronal activity were associated with decreased intra- and interhemispheric functional connectivity. These results demonstrate that the combination of the DREADD technology and non-invasive functional imaging methods is a valuable tool for unraveling the underlying mechanisms of network function and dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge facing the genetics of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is the large and growing number of candidate risk genes and gene variants of unknown functional significance. Here, we used Caenorhabditis elegans to systematically functionally characterize ASD-associated genes in vivo. Using our custom machine vision system we quantified 26 phenotypes spanning morphology, locomotion, tactile sensitivity, and habituation learning in 87 strains each carrying a mutation in an ortholog of an ASD-associated gene. We identified hundreds of novel genotype-phenotype relationships ranging from severe developmental delays and uncoordinated movement to subtle deficits in sensory and learning behaviors. We clustered genes by similarity in phenomic profiles and used epistasis analysis to discover parallel networks centered on CHD8*chd-7 and NLGN3*nlg-1 that underlie mechanosensory hyper-responsivity and impaired habituation learning. We then leveraged our data for in vivo functional assays to gauge missense variant effect. Expression of wild-type NLG-1 in nlg-1 mutant C. elegans rescued their sensory and learning impairments. Testing the rescuing ability of all conserved ASD-associated neuroligin variants revealed varied partial loss-of-function despite proper subcellular localization. Finally, we used CRISPR-Cas9 auxin inducible degradation to determine that phenotypic abnormalities caused by developmental loss of NLG-1 can be reversed by adult expression.

    "abstract": "The sequencing of Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes has yielded many new insights about interbreeding events between extinct hominins and the ancestors of modern humans. While much attention has been paid to the relatively recent gene flow from Neanderthals and Denisovans into modern humans, other instances of introgression leave more subtle genomic evidence and have received less attention. Here, we present an extended version of the ARGweaver algorithm, ARGweaver-D, which can infer local genetic relationships under a user-defined demographic model that includes population splits and migration events. This Bayesian algorithm probabilistically samples ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) that specify not only tree topology and branch lengths along the genome, but also indicate migrant lineages. The sampled ARGs can therefore be parsed to produce probabilities of introgression along the genome. We show that this method is well powered to detect the archaic migration into modern humans, even with only a few samples. We then show that the method can also detect introgressed regions stemming from older migration events, or from unsampled populations. We apply it to human, Neanderthal, and Denisovan genomes, looking for signatures of older proposed migration events, including ancient humans into Neanderthal, and unknown archaic hominins into Denisovans. We identify 3% of the Neanderthal genome that is putatively introgressed from ancient humans, and estimate that the gene flow occurred between 200-300kya. We find no convincing evidence that negative selection acted against these regions. We also identify 1% of the Denisovan genome which was likely introgressed from an unsequenced hominin ancestor, and note that 15% of these regions have been passed on to modern humans through subsequent gene flow.",

    "abstract": "Transgenerational Epigenetic Inheritance occurs when gametes transmit forms of information without altering genomic DNA1. Although deficiency for telomerase in human families causes transgenerational shortening of telomeres2, a role for telomeres in Transgenerational Epigenetic Inheritance is unknown. Here we show that Protection Of Telomeres 1 (Pot1) proteins, which interact with single-stranded telomeric DNA3,4, function in gametes to regulate developmental expression of telomeric foci for multiple generations. C. elegans POT-1 and POT-25,6 formed abundant telomeric foci in adult germ cells that vanished in 1-cell embryos and gradually accumulated during development. pot-2 mutants displayed abundant POT-1::mCherry foci throughout development. pot-2 mutant gametes created F1 cross-progeny with constitutively abundant POT-1::mCherry and mNeonGreen::POT-2 foci, which persisted for 6 generations but did not alter telomere length. pot-1 mutant and pot-2; pot-1 double mutant gametes gave rise to progeny with constitutively diminished Pot1 foci. Genomic silencing and small RNAs potentiate many transgenerational effects7 but did not affect Pot1 foci. We conclude that C. elegans POT-1 functions at telomeres of pot-2 mutant gametes to create constitutively high levels of Pot1 foci in future generations. As regulation of telomeres and Pot1 have been tied to cancer8,9, this novel and highly persistent form of Transgenerational Epigenetic Inheritance could be relevant to human health.",

    "abstract": "Leeches are found in terrestrial, aquatic, and marine habitats on all continents. Sanguivorous leeches have been used in medicine for millennia. Modern scientific uses include studies of neurons, anticoagulants, and gut microbial symbioses. Hirudo verbana, the European medicinal leech, maintains a gut community dominated by two bacterial symbionts, Aeromonas veronii and Mucinivorans hirudinis, which sometimes account for as much as 97% of the total crop microbiota. The highly simplified gut anatomy and microbiome of H. verbana make it an excellent model organism for studying gut microbial dynamics. The North American medicinal leech, Macrobdella decora, is a hirudinid leech native to Canada and the northern U.S.A. In this study we show that M. decora symbiont communities are very similar to those in H. verbana. This similarity allowed for an extensive study in which wild caught animals were sampled to determine effects of geographic separation, time of collection, and feeding on the microbiome. Through 16S V4 rRNA deep sequencing we show that: i) the M. decora gut and bladder microbial communities are distinct, ii) the M. decora gut community is affected by feeding and long periods of starvation, and iii) geographic separation does not appear to affect the overall gut microbial community structure. We propose that M. decora is a replacement for H. verbana for studies of wild-caught animals and offer evidence for the conservation of annelid symbionts. Successful culturing and comparison of dominant symbionts from M. decora and H. verbena will provide the ability to assess host-symbiont co-evolution in future work.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEBuilding evidence implicates the gut microbiome in regulating animal digestion, nutritional acquisition, immune regulation, development, and even mood regulation. Because of the difficulty of assigning causative relationships in complex gut microbiomes a simplified model for testing hypotheses is necessary. Previous research in Hirudo verbana has suggested this animal as a highly simplified and tractable animal model of gut symbioses. Our data show that Macrobdella decora may work just as well as H. verbana without the drawback of being an endangered organism and with the added convenience of easy access to field-caught specimens. The similarity of the microbial community structure of species from two different continents reveals the highly-conserved nature of the microbial symbionts in sanguivorous leeches and confirms the medicinal leech as a highly simplified, natural animal model in which to study gut symbioses.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is the major organism responsible for surgical implant infections. Antimicrobial treatment of these infections often fails leading to expensive surgical intervention and increased risk of mortality to the patient. The challenge in treating these infections is associated with the high tolerance of S. aureus biofilm to antibiotics. MazEF, a toxin-antitoxin system, is thought to be an important regulator of this phenotype, but its physiological function in S. aureus is controversial. Here, we examined the role of MazEF in developing chronic infections by comparing growth and antibiotic tolerance phenotypes in three S. aureus strains to their corresponding strains with disruption of mazF expression. Strains lacking mazF production showed increased biofilm growth, and decreased biofilm antibiotic tolerance. Deletion of icaADBC in the mazF::tn background suppressed the growth phenotype observed with mazF-disrupted strains, suggesting the phenotype was ica-dependent. We confirmed these phenotypes in our murine animal model. Loss of mazF resulted in increased bacterial burden and decreased survival rate compared to its wild-type strain demonstrating that loss of the mazF gene caused an increase in S. aureus virulence. Although lack of mazF gene expression increased S. aureus virulence, it was more susceptible to antibiotics in vivo. Combined, the ability of mazF to inhibit biofilm formation and promote biofilm antibiotic tolerance plays a critical role in transitioning from an acute to chronic infection that is difficult to eradicate with antibiotics alone.\\n\\nImportanceSurgical infections are one of the most common types of infections obtained in a hospital. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogen associated with this infection. These infections are resilient and difficult to eradicate as the bacteria form a biofilm, a community of bacteria held together by an extracellular matrix. Compared to bacteria floating in liquid, bacteria in a biofilm are more resistant to antibiotics. The mechanism behind how bacteria develop this resistance and establish a chronic infection is unknown. We demonstrate that mazEF, a toxin-antitoxin gene, inhibits biofilm formation and promotes biofilm antibiotic tolerance which allows S. aureus to transition from an acute to chronic infection that cannot be eradicated with antibiotics but is less virulent. This gene not only makes the bacteria more tolerant to antibiotics but makes the bacteria more tolerant to the host.",

    "abstract": "Laboratory pedagogy is moving away from step-by-step instructions and toward inquiry-based learning (IBL), but only now developing methods for integrating inquiry-based writing (IBW) practices into the laboratory course. Based on an earlier proposal (Science 332:919 (2011)), we designed and implemented an IBW sequence in a university bioinformatics course.\\n\\nWe automatically generated unique, double-blinded, biologically plausible DNA sequences for each student. After guided instruction, students investigated sequences independently and responded through IBW writing assignments. IBW assignments were structured as condensed versions of a scientific research paper, and because the sequences were double blinded, they were also assessed as authentic science and evaluated on clarity and persuasiveness.\\n\\nWe piloted the approach in a seven-day workshop (35 students) at Perdana University Graduate School of Medicine in Kuala Lumpur. We observed dramatically improved student engagement and indirect evidence of improved learning outcomes over a similar workshop without IBW. Based on student feedback, initial discomfort with the writing component abated in favor of an overall positive response and increasing comfort with the high demands of student writing. Similarly encouraging results were found in a semester length undergraduate module at the National University of Singapore (155 students).",

    "abstract": "Efficient pathogen detection is essential for the successful treatment and prevention of infectious disease; however, current methods are often too time intensive to be clinically relevant in cases requiring immediate intervention. We have developed a Surface Programmable Activation Receptor (SPAR) diagnostic platform comprised of universal biosensor cells engineered for use in combination with custom or commercial antibodies to achieve rapid and sensitive pathogen detection. SPAR cells are stably transfected Jurkat T cells designed to constitutively express a modified T cell mouse Fc{gamma}RI receptor on the cell surface and a high level of the luminescent reporter protein aequorin in the cytoplasm. The modified mFc{gamma}RI-CD3{zeta} receptor protein binds with high affinity to the Fc region of any full-length mouse IgG2a and some IgG2 antibodies: this allows customized target detection via the selection of specific antibodies. T-cell receptor aggregation in response to target antigen binding results in signal transduction which, when amplified via the endogenous T cell signal cascade, triggers the rapid intracellular release of calcium. Increased Ca2+ concentrations activate the expressed reporter protein aequorin resulting in the immediate emission of detectable light. Testing demonstrates the accurate and specific detection of numerous targets including P. aeruginosa, E. coli O111, and E. coli O157. We report that the SPAR biosensor cell platform is a reliable pathogen detection method that enables the rapid identification of bacterial causative agents using standard laboratory instrumentation. The technology lends itself to the development of efficient point-of-care testing and may aid in the implementation of effective and pathogen-specific clinical therapies.",

    "abstract": "Firre encodes a lncRNA involved in nuclear organization in mammals. Here we find that Firre RNA is transcribed from the active X chromosome (Xa) and exerts trans-acting effects on the inactive X chromosome (Xi). Allelic deletion of Firre on the Xa in a mouse hybrid fibroblast cell line results in a dramatic loss of the histone modification H3K27me3 and of components of the PRC2 complex on the Xi as well as the disruption of the perinucleolar location of the Xi. These features are measurably rescued by ectopic expression of a mouse or human Firre/FIRRE cDNA transgene, strongly supporting a conserved trans-acting role of the Firre transcript in maintaining the Xi heterochromatin environment. Surprisingly, CTCF occupancy is decreased on the Xi upon loss of Firre RNA, but is partially recovered by ectopic transgene expression, suggesting a functional link between Firre RNA and CTCF in maintenance of epigenetic features and/or location of the Xi. Loss of Firre RNA results in dysregulation of genes implicated in cell division and development, but not in reactivation of genes on the Xi, which retains its bipartite structure despite some changes in chromatin contact distribution. Allelic deletion or inversion of Firre on the Xi causes localized redistribution of chromatin contacts, apparently dependent on the orientation of CTCF binding sites clustered at the locus. Thus, the Firre locus and its RNA have roles in the maintenance of epigenetic features and structure of the Xi.",

    "abstract": "Stem cells are continuously exposed to multiple stresses including radiation and tissue injury. Because stem cells are central drivers of tissue repair and regeneration, it is essential to understand how their behavior is influenced by these stressors. Planarians have an abundant population of stem cells that are rapidly eliminated after radiation exposure via apoptosis. Low doses of radiation eliminate the majority of these stem cells, allowing a few to remain [1]. Here, we combine radiation with injury to define how surviving stem cells respond to tissue damage. We find that injuries induce stem cells to persist, but only if injured within a defined window of time surrounding radiation, and only immediately adjacent to the wound. Stem cells persist for several days without any proliferation. Instead, they are retained near the wound due to suppression of apoptosis, which we quantify in stem cells by combining FACS with Annexin V staining. Tissue injury is known to induce apoptosis in differentiated cells [2], and we hypothesize that these dying cells confer apoptosis resistance onto nearby stem cells. Indeed, pharmacological induction of cell death with cycloheximide is sufficient to prolong survival of radiated stem cells even in the absence of injury. Together, our results suggest a model in which dying cells provide a transient protective signal to nearby stem cells, altering their susceptibility to radiation-induced apoptosis.",
