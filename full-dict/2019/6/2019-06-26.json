    "abstract": "The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR/ErbB1/HER1) plays an important role in both physiological and cancer-related processes. To study the factors that influence receptor phosphorylation, we have coupled Single Molecule Pull-down (SiMPull) measurements with rule-based modeling of EGFR signaling. Using SiMPull, we quantified the phosphorylation state of thousands of individual receptors. These measurements enabled the first direct detection of multisite phosphorylation on full-length EGFR and revealed that the extent of phosphorylation varies by tyrosine site and is dependent on the relative abundance of signaling partners that limit access by tyrosine phosphatases. We also evaluated the impact of oncogenic mutations and ligands with varying affinity on phosphorylation kinetics. Simulations highlight the importance of dimer lifetimes on EGFR phosphorylation and signaling output.",

    "abstract": "Standard models of sex chromosome evolution propose that recombination suppression leads to the degeneration of the heterogametic chromosome, as is seen for the Y chromosome in mammals and the W chromosome in most birds. Unlike other birds, paleognaths (ratites and tinamous) possess large non-degenerate regions on their sex chromosomes (PARs or pseudoautosomal regions). It remains unclear why these large PARs are retained over more than 100 MY, and how this retention impacts the evolution of sex chromosomes within this system. To address this puzzle, we analysed Z chromosome evolution and gene expression across 12 paleognaths, several of whose genomes have recently been sequenced. We confirm at the genomic level that most paleognaths retain large PARs. As in other birds, we find that all paleognaths have incomplete dosage compensation on the regions of the Z chromosome homologous to degenerated portions of the W (differentiated regions or DRs), but we find no evidence for enrichments of male-biased genes in PARs. We find limited evidence for increased evolutionary rates (faster-Z) either across the chromosome or in DRs for most paleognaths with large PARs, but do recover signals of faster-Z evolution in tinamou species with mostly degenerated W chromosomes, similar to the pattern seen in neognaths. Unexpectedly, in some species PAR-linked genes evolve faster on average than genes on autosomes, suggested by diverse genomic features to be due to reduced efficacy of selection in paleognath PARs. Our analysis shows that paleognath Z chromosomes are atypical at the genomic level, but the evolutionary forces maintaining largely homomorphic sex chromosomes in these species remain elusive.",

    "abstract": "The vascular organization of the human brain can determine neurological and neurophysiological functions, yet thus far it has not been comprehensively mapped. Aging and diseases such as dementia are known to be associated with changes to the vasculature and normative data could help detect these vascular changes in neuroimaging studies. Furthermore, given the well-known impact of venous vessels on the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal, information about the common location of veins could help detect biases in existing datasets. In this work, a quantitative atlas of the venous vasculature using quantitative susceptibility maps (QSM) acquired with a 0.6 mm isotropic resolution is presented. The Venous Neuroanatomy (VENAT) atlas was created from 5 repeated 7 Tesla MRI measurements in young and healthy volunteers (n = 20, 10 females, mean age = 25.1 {+/-} 2.5 years) using a two-step registration method on 3D segmentations of the venous vasculature. This cerebral vein atlas includes the average vessel location, diameter (mean: 0.84 {+/-} 0.33 mm) and curvature (0.11 {+/-} 0.05 mm-1) from all participants and provides an in vivo measure of the angio-architectonic organization of the human brain and its variability. This atlas can be used as a basis to understand changes in the vasculature during aging and neurodegeneration, as well as vascular and physiological effects in neuroimaging.",

    "abstract": "Shifts in life history evolution can potentiate sexual selection and speciation. However, we rarely understand the causative links between correlated patterns of diversification or the tipping points that initiate changes with cascading effects. We investigated livebearing fishes with repeated transitions from pre- (lecithotrophy) to post-fertilization maternal provisioning (matrotrophy) to identify the potential ecological drivers of evolutionary transitions in life history. Phylogenetic comparative analyses across 94 species revealed that bi-directional evolution along the lecithotrophy-matrotrophy continuum is correlated with ecology, supporting adaptive hypotheses of life history diversification. Consistent with theory, matrotrophy was associated with high resource availability and low competition. Our results suggest that ecological sources of selection contribute to the diversification of female provisioning strategies in livebearing fishes, which have been associated with macroevolutionary patterns of sexual selection and speciation.",

    "abstract": "Male genital structures are among the most rapidly evolving morphological traits and are often the only features that can distinguish closely related species. This process is thought to be driven by sexual selection and may reinforce species separation. However, while the genetic basis of many phenotypic differences have been identified, we still lack knowledge about the genes underlying evolutionary differences in male genital organs and organ size more generally. The claspers (surstyli) are periphallic structures that play an important role in copulation in insects. Here we show that natural variation in clasper size and bristle number between Drosophila mauritiana and D. simulans is caused by evolutionary changes in tartan (trn), which encodes a transmembrane leucine-rich repeat domain protein that mediates cell-cell interactions and affinity differences. There are no fixed amino acid differences in trn between D. mauritiana and D. simulans but differences in the expression of this gene in developing genitalia suggest cis-regulatory changes in trn underlie the evolution of clasper morphology in these species. Finally, analysis of reciprocal hemizyotes that are genetically identical, except for which species the functional allele of trn is from, determined that the trn allele of D. mauritiana specifies larger claspers with more bristles than the allele of D. simulans. Therefore we have identified the first gene underlying evolutionary change in the size of a male genital organ, which will help to better understand the rapid diversification of these structures and the regulation and evolution of organ size more broadly.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe morphology of male genital organs evolves rapidly driven by sexual selection. However, little is known about the genes underlying genitalia differences between species. Identifying these genes is key to understanding how sexual selection acts on development to produce rapid phenotypic change. We have found that the gene tartan underlies differences between male Drosophila mauritiana and D. simulans in the size and bristle number of the claspers - genital projections that grasp the female during copulation. Moreover, since tartan encodes a protein that is involved in cell affinity, this may represent a new developmental mechanism for morphological change. Therefore, our study provides new insights into genetic and developmental bases for the rapid evolution of male genitalia and organ size more generally.",

The Transpose RT system (InGeneron, Inc., Houston, TX, USA) is a system for isolating ADRCs from adipose tissue, commercially available in Europe as a CE-marked medical device and under clinical evaluation in the United States. This system makes use of the proprietary, enzymatic Matrase Reagent for isolating cells. The present study addressed the question whether the use of Matrase Reagent influences cell yield, cell viability, live cell yield, biological characteristics, physiological functions or structural properties of the ADRCs in final cell suspension.\\n\\nMethodsIdentical samples of subcutaneous adipose tissue from 12 subjects undergoing elective lipoplasty were processed either with or without the use of Matrase Reagent. Then, characteristics of the ADRCs in the respective final cell suspensions were evaluated.\\n\\nResultsCompared to non-enzymatic isolation, enzymatic isolation resulted in approximately twelve times higher mean cell yield (i.e., numbers of viable cells/ml lipoaspirate) and approximately 16 times more colony forming units. Despite these differences, cells isolated from lipoaspirate both with and without the use of Matrase Reagent were independently able to differentiate into cells of all three germ layers.\\n\\nDiscussionThe data of this study indicate that biological characteristics, physiological functions or structural properties relevant for the intended use were not altered or induced using Matrase Reagent. A comprehensive literature review demonstrated that isolation of ADRCs from lipoaspirate using the Transpose RT system and the Matrase Reagent results in the highest viable cell yield among all published data regarding isolation of ADRCs from lipoaspirate.",

At all levels of the spinal cord examined, NADPH-d activities were present in neurons and fibers in the superficial dorsal horn, dorsal commissure and in neurons around the central canal. In addition, the sympathetic autonomic nucleus in the thoracic and rostral lumbar segments exhibited prominent NADPH-d cellular staining whereas the sacral parasympathetic nucleus (SPN) in the sacral segments was not well stained. Interestingly, we found abundant NADPH-d positive enlarged-diameter fibers termed megaloneurite, which characteristically occurred in the aged sacral segments, distributed in the dorsal gray commissure (DGC), lateral collateral pathway (LCP) the lateral fasciculi and the central canal compared with the cervical, thoracic and lumbar segments. The dense, abnormal NADPH-d megaloneurites occurred in extending from dorsal entry zone through lamina I along with the lateral boundary of the dorsal horn to the region of the SPN. These fibers were prominent in the S1-S3 segments but not in adjacent segments L5-L7 and Cx1 or in thoracolumbar segments and cervical segments. Double staining with GFAP, NeuN, CGRP, MAP2 and Iba1, NADPH-d megaloneurite colocalized with vasoactive intestinal peptide. Presumably, the megaloneurites may represent, in part, visceral afferent projections to the SPN and/or DGC. The NADPH-d megaloneurites in the aged sacral spinal cord indicated some anomalous changes in the neurites, which might account for a disturbance in the aging pathway of the autonomic and sensory nerve in the pelvic visceral organs.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic targeting of blood coagulation is a challenging task as it interferes with the delicate balance of pro- and anticoagulant activities. Anticoagulants are employed in millions of thrombophilic patients worldwide each year. The treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism has changed drastically with the replacement of traditional anticoagulant vitamin K antagonists by direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), which selectively target coagulation factors Xa or IIa. However for a growing population with comorbidities satisfying therapeutic options are still lacking and the quest for novel therapeutics continues. Recently targeting factors XI or XII have emerged as new therapeutic strategies. As these factors play important roles in thrombosis, nevertheless are practically functionally dispensable for hemostasis, they may potentially overcome the functional obstacle of treating or preventing thrombosis without affecting hemostasis. Based on the recent elucidation of the hemostatic miRNA targetome, we introduce and discuss a hitherto unrecognized rationale for the therapeutic targeting of factor XI. This is based on mimicking endogenous factor XI expression control by therapeutic delivery of miRNA mimics. We discuss the functional difference between various gene targeting approaches, and propose the hemostatic system to represent an ideal model for assessment of the efficacy and safety of such therapeutic components, ushering in a novel therapeutic era with broad applicability.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSelecting the proper parameter settings for bioinformatic software tools is challenging. Not only will each parameter have an individual effect on the outcome, but there are also potential interaction effects between parameters. Both of these effects may be difficult to predict. To make the situation even more complex, multiple tools may be run in a sequential pipeline where the final output depends on the parameter configuration for each tool in the pipeline. Because of the complexity and difficulty of predicting outcomes, in practice parameters are often left at default settings or set based on personal or peer experience obtained in a trial and error fashion. To allow for the reliable and efficient selection of parameters for bioinformatic pipelines, a systematic approach is needed.\\n\\nResultsWe present doepipeline, a novel approach to optimizing bioinformatic software parameters, based on core concepts of the Design of Experiments methodology and recent advances in subset designs. Optimal parameter settings are first approximated in a screening phase using a subset design that efficiently spans the entire search space, then optimized in the subsequent phase using response surface designs and OLS modeling. doepipeline was used to optimize parameters in four use cases; 1) de-novo assembly, 2) scaffolding of a fragmented genome assembly, 3) k-mer taxonomic classification of Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION reads, and 4) genetic variant calling. In all four cases, doepipeline found parameter settings that produced a better outcome with respect to the characteristic measured when compared to using default values. Our approach is implemented and available in the Python package doepipeline.\\n\\nConclusionsOur proposed methodology provides a systematic and robust framework for optimizing software parameter settings, in contrast to labor- and time-intensive manual parameter tweaking. Implementation in doepipeline makes our methodology accessible and user-friendly, and allows for automatic optimization of tools in a wide range of cases.

    "abstract": "Determining the  space race between sympatric species is crucial to understand the effects of interspecific interactions on the extinction risk of species threatened by poachers, predators, pathogens, and invasive competitors. Dynamic two-species occupancy models provide a flexible framework to decompose complex species interaction patterns while accounting for imperfect detection. In particular, these models can describe poachers-wildlife interactions by considering the occupancy, the extinction and colonisation probabilities of wildlife conditional on the presence or absence of poachers and vice versa. We apply our model to a case study on wildlife poaching in the Eastern plains of Cambodia. We used co-occurrence data extracted from the database of the SMART partnership to study the distribution dynamics between poachers and six ungulate species regarded as main prey of tigers. We used 4 years of survey data reporting the locations of ranger patrols on the detection of snares with visual detections or presence signs of the ungulates. Our results showed that a substantial proportion of the sites occupied by ungulate species went extinct over the years of the study while the proportion of sites colonised by poachers increased. We also showed, for the first time, that spatio-temporal heterogeneity in the patrolling effort explains a great deal of the variation in the detection of poachers and ungulates. Our approach provides practitioners with a flexible and robust tool to assess conservation status of species and extinction risk of wildlife populations. It can assist managers in better evaluating, learning and adapting the patrolling strategies of rangers.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging techniques are increasingly used to study brain cognition in humans. Beyond their individual activation, the functional associations between brain areas have become a standard proxy to describe how information is distributed across the brain network. Among the many analysis tools available, dynamic models of brain activity have been developed to overcome the limitations of original connectivity measures such as functional connectivity. In particular, much effort has been devoted to the assessment of directional interactions between brain areas from their observed activity. This paper summarizes our recent approach to analyze fMRI data based on our whole-brain effective connectivity referred to as MOU-EC, while discussing the pros and cons of its underlying assumptions with respect to other established approaches. Once tuned, the model provides a connectivity measure that reflects the dynamical state of BOLD activity obtained using fMRI, which can be used to explore the brain cognition. We focus on two important applications. First, as a connectivity measure, MOU-EC can be used to extract biomarkers for task-specific brain coordination, understood as the patterns of areas exchanging information. The multivariate nature of connectivity measures raises several challenges for whole-brain analysis, for which machine-learning tools presents some advantages over statistical testing. Second, we show how to interpret changes in MOU-EC connections in a collective and model-based manner, bridging with network analysis. To illustrate our framework, we use a dataset where subjects were recorded in two conditions, watching a movie and a black screen (referred to as rest). Our framework provides a comprehensive set of tools that open exciting perspectives for the study of distributed cognition, as well as neuropathologies.",

    "abstract": "Antigen presentation by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) is a cornerstone of the cellular immune system, and characterization of the rules defining which peptides are suitable for MHC presentation is of key interest for understanding T cell immunogenicity and the development of T cell driven therapeutics. The collective set of peptides presented on a cell surface by MHC molecules is known as the immunopeptidome. Due to the vast MHC polymorphism, this peptidome is unique between individuals. Current state-of-the-art liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technologies allow the identification of large peptidomes specific for a given host or cell line, and numerous studies have proven this data to be a rich source of information for learning the rules of MHC-mediated antigen presentation. The data obtained with MS techniques is usually poly-specific - i.e. it contains multiple sequence motifs matching the different MHC molecules expressed in the system under investigation. Deconvolution of this poly-specificity has proven a challenge, and imposes a substantial limitation for learning MHC specific rules for antigen presentation from immunopeptidome data. This since each ligand first must be unambiguously associated to its presenting MHC molecule(s) within the haplotype of the cell line.\n\nHere, we describe NNAlign_MA, a method that is able to address this challenge. NNAlign_MA is capable of taking a mixed training set composed of single-allele (SA) data (peptides assigned to single MHCs) and multi-allele (MA) data (peptides with multiple options for MHCs assignments) as input, and in a fully automated manner deconvolute the individual MHC restriction of all MA sequences while learning the binding specificities of all the MHCs present in the training set.\n\nThe NNAlign_MA method was benchmarked on a large and diverse dataset, covering human MHC class I and class II, and bovine class I (BoLA) data. For all cases, the method was demonstrated to have unprecedented performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving a complete deconvolution of binding motifs contained within poly-specificity MS eluted ligand data and an improved predictive performance for identification of both eluted ligands and T cell epitopes.\n\nGiven its very high flexibility and ease of use, we expect NNAlign_MA to serve as an effective tool to increase our understanding of the rules for MHC antigen presentation and guide the development of novel T cell-based therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Errors in gene transcription can be costly, and organisms have evolved to prevent their occurrence or mitigate their costs. The simplest interpretation of the drift barrier hypothesis suggests that species with larger population sizes would have lower transcriptional error rates. However, Escherichia coli seems to have a higher transcriptional error rate than species with lower effective population sizes, e.g. Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This could be explained if selection in E. coli were strong enough to maintain adaptations that mitigate the consequences of transcriptional errors through robustness, on a gene by gene basis, obviating the need for low transcriptional error rates and associated costs of global proofreading. Here we note that if selection is powerful enough to evolve local robustness, selection should also be powerful enough to locally reduce error rates. We therefore predict that transcriptional error rates will be lower in highly abundant proteins on which selection is strongest. However, we only expect this result when error rates are high enough to significantly impact fitness. As expected, we find such a relationship between expression and transcriptional error rate for non CU errors in E. coli (especially GA), but not in S. cerevisiae. We do not find this pattern for CU changes in E. coli, presumably because most deamination events occurred during sample preparation, but do for CU changes in S. cerevisiae, supporting the interpretation that CU error rates estimated with an improved protocol, and which occur at rates comparable to E. coli non CU errors, are biological.",

    "abstract": "Learning in neuronal networks has developed in many directions, in particular to reproduce cognitive tasks like image recognition and speech processing. Implementations have been inspired by stereotypical neuronal responses like tuning curves in the visual system, where, for example, ON/OFF cells fire or not depending on the contrast in their receptive fields. Classical models of neuronal networks therefore map a set of input signals to a set of activity levels in the output of the network. Each category of inputs is thereby predominantly characterized by its mean. In the case of time series, fluctuations around this mean constitute noise in this view. For this paradigm, the high variability exhibited by the cortical activity may thus imply limitations or constraints, which have been discussed for many years. For example, the need for averaging neuronal activity over long periods or large groups of cells to assess a robust mean and to diminish the effect of noise correlations. To reconcile robust computations with variable neuronal activity, we here propose a conceptual change of perspective by employing variability of activity as the basis for stimulus-related information to be learned by neurons, rather than merely being the noise that corrupts the mean signal. In this new paradigm both afferent and recurrent weights in a network are tuned to shape the input-output mapping for covariances, the second-order statistics of the fluctuating activity. When including time lags, covariance patterns define a natural metric for time series that capture their propagating nature. We develop the theory for classification of time series based on their spatio-temporal covariances, which reflect dynamical properties. We demonstrate that recurrent connectivity is able to transform information contained in the temporal structure of the signal into spatial covariances. Finally, we use the MNIST database to show how the covariance perceptron can capture specific second-order statistical patterns generated by moving digits.\n\nAuthor summaryThe dynamics in cortex is characterized by highly fluctuating activity: Even under the very same experimental conditions the activity typically does not reproduce on the level of individual spikes. Given this variability, how then does the brain realize its quasi-deterministic function? One obvious solution is to compute averages over many cells, assuming that the mean activity, or rate, is actually the decisive signal. Variability across trials of an experiment is thus considered noise. We here explore the opposite view: Can fluctuations be used to actually represent information? And if yes, is there a benefit over a representation using the mean rate? We find that a fluctuation-based scheme is not only powerful in distinguishing signals into several classes, but also that networks can efficiently be trained in the new paradigm. Moreover, we argue why such a scheme of representation is more consistent with known forms of synaptic plasticity than rate-based network dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Small extracellular vesicles called exosomes affect a variety of autocrine and paracrine cellular phenotypes, including cellular migration, immune activation, and neuronal function. Understanding the function of exosomes requires a variety of tools, including live cell imaging. We previously constructed a live-cell reporter, pHluorin-CD63, that allows dynamic subcellular monitoring of exosome secretion in migrating and spreading cells. However, there were some caveats to its use, including dim fluorescence and the inability to make cell lines that stably express the protein. By incorporating a stabilizing mutation in the pHluorin moiety, M153R, pHluorin-CD63 now exhibits higher and stable expression in cells and superior monitoring of exosome secretion. Using this improved construct, we demonstrate visualization of secreted exosomes in 3D culture and in vivo and identify a role for exosomes in promoting leader-follower behavior in 2D and 3D migration. By incorporating a further non-pH-sensitive red fluorescent tag, this reporter allows visualization of the exosome lifecycle, including multivesicular body (MVB) trafficking, MVB fusion, exosome uptake and endosome acidification. This new reporter will be a useful tool for understanding both autocrine and paracrine roles of exosomes.",

    "abstract": "Nomadic pastoralists are among the worlds hardest-to-reach and least-served populations. Pastoralist communities are difficult to capture in household surveys due to factors including their high degree of mobility over remote terrain, fluid domestic arrangements, and cultural barriers. Most surveys utilize census-based sampling frames which do not accurately capture the demographic and health parameters of nomadic populations. As a result, pastoralists are \\\"invisible\\\" in population data such as the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). By combining remote sensing and geospatial analysis, we developed a sampling strategy designed to capture the current distribution of nomadic populations.\\n\\nWe then implemented this sampling frame to survey a population of mobile pastoralists in southwest Ethiopia, focusing on maternal and child health (MCH) indicators. Using standardized instruments from DHS questionnaires, we draw comparisons with regional and national data finding disparities with DHS data in core MCH indicators including vaccination coverage, skilled birth attendance, and nutritional status. Our field validation demonstrates that this method is a logistically feasible alternative to conventional sampling frames and may be used at the population level. Geospatial sampling methods provide cost-affordable and logistically feasible strategies for sampling mobile populations, a crucial first step towards reaching these groups with health services.",

    "abstract": "The glycolytic/lipogenic axis promotes the synthesis of energetic molecules and building blocks necessary to support cell growth, although the absolute requirement of this metabolic axis must be deeply investigated. Here, we used Drosophila genetics and focus on the mTOR signaling network that controls cell growth and homeostasis. mTOR is present in two distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. The former directly responds to amino acids and energetic levels, whereas the latter is required to sustain the signaling response downstream of insulin-like-peptide (Ilp) stimulation. Either signaling branch can be independently modulated in most Drosophila tissues. We confirm this independency in the fat tissue. We show that ubiquitous over-activation of mTORC1 or Ilp signaling affects carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, supporting the use of Drosophila as a powerful model to study the link between growth and metabolism. We show that cell-autonomous restriction of glycolysis or lipogenesis in fat cells impedes overgrowth dependent on Ilp-but not mTORC1-signaling. Additionally, ubiquitous deficiency of lipogenesis (FASN mutants) results in a drop in mTORC1 but not Ilp signaling, whereas, at the cell-autonomous level, lipogenesis deficiency affects none of these signals in fat cells. These findings thus, reveal differential metabolic sensitivity of mTORC1- and Ilp-dependent overgrowth. Furthermore, they suggest that local metabolic defects may elicit compensatory pathways between neighboring cells, whereas enzyme knockdown in the whole organism results in animal death. Importantly, our study weakens the use of single inhibitors to fight mTOR-related diseases and strengthens the use of drug combination and selective tissue-targeting.",

    "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) self-renew and generate all blood cells. Recent studies with single-cell transplants (1-3) and lineage tracing (4, 5) suggest that adult HSCs are diverse in their reconstitution and lineage potentials. However, prospective isolation of these subpopulations has remained challenging. Here, we identify Neogenin-1 (NEO1) as a unique surface marker on a fraction of mouse HSCs labeled with Hoxb5, a specific reporter of long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs) (6). We show that NEO1+Hoxb5+ LT-HSCs expand with age and respond to myeloablative stress, while NEO1-Hoxb5+ LT-HSCs exhibit no significant change in number. NEO1+Hoxb5+ LT-HSCs are more often in the G2/S cell cycle phase compared to NEO1-Hoxb5+ LT-HSCs in both young and old bone marrow. Upon serial transplantation, NEO1+Hoxb5+ LT-HSCs exhibit myeloid-biased differentiation and reduced reconstitution, while NEO1-Hoxb5+ LT-HSCs are lineage-balanced and stably reconstitute recipients. Gene expression comparison reveals increased expression of cell cycle genes and evidence of lineage-priming in the NEO1+ fraction. Finally, transplanted NEO1+Hoxb5+ LT-HSCs rarely generate NEO1-Hoxb5+ LT-HSCs, while NEO1-Hoxb5+ LT-HSCs repopulate both LT-HSC fractions. This supports a model in which dormant, balanced, NEO1-Hoxb5+ LT-HSCs can hierarchically precede active, myeloid-biased NEO1+Hoxb5+ LT-HSCs.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTHematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are rare cells that have the unique ability to regenerate themselves and produce all blood cells throughout life. However, HSCs are functionally heterogeneous and several studies have shown that HSCs can differ in their contribution to major blood lineages. In this study, we discovered that the surface marker, Neogenin-1, can divide mouse HSCs into two subpopulations--one that is more active but biased towards producing myeloid cells and another that is more dormant and capable of equally producing all blood lineages. Neogenin-1 reveals the diversity and hierarchical relationship of HSCs in the mouse bone marrow, enables the prospective isolation of myeloid-biased and balanced HSCs, and opens opportunities to do the same in humans.",

    "abstract": "O_LIThe increase in availability of species data sets means that approaches to species distribution modelling that incorporate multiple data sets are in greater demand. Recent methodological developments in this area have led to combined likelihood approaches, in which a log-likelihood comprised of the sum of the log-likelihood components of each data source is maximised. Often, these approaches make use of at least one presence-only data set and use the log-likelihood of an inhomogeneous Poisson point process model in the combined likelihood construction. While these advancements have been shown to improve predictive performance, they do not currently address challenges in presence-only modelling such as checking and correcting for violations of the independence assumption of a Poisson point process model or more general challenges in species distribution modelling such as overfitting.\\nC_LIO_LIIn this paper, we present an extension of the combined likelihood frame-work which accommodates alternative presence-only likelihoods in the presence of spatial dependence as well as lasso-type penalties to account for potential overfitting. We compare the proposed combined penalised likelihood approach to the standard combined likelihood approach via simulation and apply the method to modelling the distribution of the Eurasian lynx in the Jura Mountains in eastern France.\\nC_LIO_LIThe simulations show that the proposed combined penalised likelihood approach has better predictive performance than the standard approach when spatial dependence is present in the data. The lynx analysis shows that the predicted maps vary significantly between the model fitted with the proposed combined penalised approach accounting for spatial dependence and the model fitted with the standard combined likelihood.\\nC_LIO_LIThis work highlights the benefits of careful consideration of the presence-only components of the combined likelihood formulation, and allows greater flexibility and ability to accommodate real datasets.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Animal responses occur according to a specific temporal structure composed of two states, where a bout is followed by a long pause until the next bout. Such about-and-pause pattern has three components: the bout length, the within-bout response rate, and the bout initiation rate. Previous studies have investigated how these three components are affected by experimental manipulations. However, it remains unknown what underlying mechanisms cause bout-and-pause patterns. In this article, we propose two mechanisms and examine computational models developed based on reinforcement learning. The model is characterized by two mechanisms. The first mechanism is choice\u2014an agent makes a choice between operant and other behaviors. The second mechanism is cost\u2014a cost is associated with the changeover of behaviors. These two mechanisms are extracted from past experimental findings. Simulation results suggested that both the choice and cost mechanisms are required to generate bout-and-pause patterns and if either of them is knocked out, the model does not generate bout-and-pause patterns. We further analyzed the proposed model and found that it reproduced the relationships between experimental manipulations and the three components that have been reported by previous studies. In addition, we showed alternative models can generate bout-and-pause patterns as long as they implement the two mechanisms.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

Consistently high blood glucose levels can lead to serious diseases affecting the heart and blood vessels, eyes, kidney, etc. In addition, people with diabetes also have a higher risk of developing infections.\\n\\nThis paper aims to use suitable data mining and classification techniques which include the Logit model, the Probit model, the Classification tree technique, Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Ridge Regression technique and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator(LASSO) in order to determine the best method which can be used to classify the patients as suffering from gestational diabetes or not. The misclassification rate is calculated for different methods and the method having the least misclassification rate is said to be the most suitable to be applied to the given data, which is the PIMA Indians diabetes dataset.",

    "abstract": "Signal transduction pathways are intricately fine-tuned to accomplish diverse biological processes. An example is the conserved Ras/mitogen-activated-protein-kinase (MAPK) pathway, which exhibits context-dependent signaling output dynamics and regulation. Here, by altering codon usage as a novel platform to control signaling output, we screened the Drosophila genome for modifiers specific to either weak or strong Ras-driven eye phenotypes. We mapped the underlying gene from one modifier to the ribosomal gene RpS21. RpS21 preferentially influences weak Ras/MAPK signaling outputs, and negatively regulates Ras/MAPK in multiple cell/tissue and signaling settings. In turn, MAPK signaling may regulate its own negative feedback by promoting RpS21 expression. These data show that codon usage manipulation can identify output-specific signaling regulators, and identify RpS21 as an in vivo Ras/MAPK phenotypic regulator.",

Here we studied the molecular interactions between -conotoxin KIIIA (KIIIA) and the human NaV1.7 channel (hNaV1.7). We developed a structural model of hNaV1.7 using Rosetta computational modeling and performed in silico docking of KIIIA using RosettaDock to predict residues forming specific pairwise contacts between KIIIA and hNaV1.7. We experimentally validated these contacts using mutant cycle analysis. Comparison between our KIIIA-hNaV1.7 model and the cryo-EM structure of KIIIA-hNaV1.2 revealed key similarities and differences between NaV channel subtypes with potential implications for the molecular mechanism of toxin block. The accuracy of our integrative approach, combining structural data with computational modeling, experimental validation, and molecular dynamics simulations, suggests that Rosetta structural predictions will be useful for rational design of novel biologics targeting specific NaV channels.",

    "abstract": "Biased signaling occurs when different ligands that are directed at the same receptor launch different cellular outcomes. Because of their pharmacological importance, we know the most about biased ligands and little is known about other mechanisms to achieve signaling bias. In the canonical animal G protein system, endocytosis of a 7-transmembrane GPCR is mediated by arrestins to propagate or arrest cytoplasmic signaling depending on the bias. In Arabidopsis, GPCRs are not required for G protein coupled signaling because the heterotrimeric G protein complex spontaneously exchanges nucleotide. Instead, the prototype 7-transmembrane Regulator of G Signaling 1 protein AtRGS1 modulates G signaling and through ligand-dependent endocytosis, de-repression of signaling is initiated but canonical arrestins are not involved. Endocytosis initiates from two separate pools of plasma membrane: sterol-dependent domains, possibly lipid rafts, and a clathrin-accessible neighborhood, each with a select set of discriminators, activators, and newly-discovered arrestin-like adaptors. Different trafficking origins and trajectories lead to different cellular outcomes. Thus, compartmentation with its attendant signalosome architecture is a previously unknown mechanism to drive biased signaling.",

We obtained resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans on 62 healthy human volunteers between ages forty and eighty before, during, and after sevoflurane (general) anesthesia, in the absence of surgery, as part of a larger study on cognitive function post-anesthesia. Resting state networks expression decreased consistently one hour after emergence from anesthesia. This corresponded to a global reduction in anticorrelated functional connectivity post-anesthesia, seen across individual regions-of-interest. Positively correlated functional connectivity remained constant across peri-anesthetic states. All measures returned to baseline 1 day later, with individual regions-of-interest essentially returning to their pre-anesthesia connectivity levels.

On the basis of known ASFV genes, ASFVdb reannotates the genomes of every strain and annotates 4833 possible ORFs. Moreover, ASFVdb performs a thorough analysis of the population genetics of all the published genomes of ASFV strains and performs functional and structural predictions for all genes. For each ASFV gene, visitors can obtain not only basic information of the gene but also the distribution of the gene in strains, conserved or high mutation regions, possible subcellular location of the gene and topology of the gene. In the genome browser, ASFVdb provides sliding window population genetics analysis results, which facilitate genetics and evolutional analyses at the genomic level.

Here, we demonstrate in rats that primary and secondary motor areas (M1 and M2) make functional synaptic connections in the globus pallidus (GP), not usually thought of as an input site of the BG using optogenetics and morphological analysis. The cortical excitation in the GP was as strong as that in the STN. GP neurons projecting to the striatum were preferentially innervated by the motor cortex. Morphological observation revealed that the density of axonal boutons from motor cortices in the GP was approximately 30% of that in the striatum, but was comparable to that in the STN. M1 and M2 projected differentially to the BG in terms of topography and substructures. These results suggest that cortico-pallidal innervation is an additional excitatory input to the BG, and can affects behaviors via the cortex-basal ganglia-thalamus loop.",

    "abstract": "The ability to connect genetic information between traits over time allow Bayesian networks to offer a powerful probabilistic framework to construct genomic prediction models. In this study, we phenotyped a diversity panel of 869 biomass sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] lines, which had been genotyped with 100,435 SNP markers, for plant height (PH) with biweekly measurements from 30 to 120 days after planting (DAP) and for end-of-season dry biomass yield (DBY) in four environments. We evaluated five genomic prediction models: Bayesian network (BN), Pleiotropic Bayesian network (PBN), Dynamic Bayesian network (DBN), multi-trait GBLUP (MTr-GBLUP), and multi-time GBLUP (MTi-GBLUP) models. In 5-fold cross-validation, prediction accuracies ranged from 0.48 (PBN) to 0.51 (MTr-GBLUP) for DBY and from 0.47 (DBN, DAP120) to 0.74 (MTi-GBLUP, DAP60) for PH. Forward-chaining cross-validation further improved prediction accuracies of the DBN, MTi-GBLUP and MTr-GBLUP models for PH (training slice: 30-45 DAP) by 36.4-52.4% relative to the BN and PBN models. Coincidence indices (target: biomass, secondary: PH) and a coincidence index based on lines (PH time series) showed that the ranking of lines by PH changed minimally after 45 DAP. These results suggest a two-level indirect selection method for PH at harvest (first-level target trait) and DBY (second-level target trait) could be conducted earlier in the season based on ranking of lines by PH at 45 DAP (secondary trait). With the advance of high-throughput phenotyping technologies, our proposed two-level indirect selection framework could be valuable for enhancing genetic gain per unit of time when selecting on developmental traits.",

Both types of mutations are involved in many human diseases.

This study designed a chip that captures the coding region of 3043 genes associated with 4013 monogenic diseases. In addition, 148 chromosomal abnormalities can be identified by setting targets in specific regions. Compared with the whole exon chip, the chip can detect 4013 monogenic diseases and 148 chromosomal abnormalities at a lower cost, including SNV, intra-gene CNV and genomic copy number variation. This study utilized a strategy of combining the BGISEQ500 sequencing platform with the chip to identify 102 disease-associated mutations in 63 patients, 69 of which were new mutations.

    "abstract": "Since its inception in 1973 the slightly deleterious model of molecular evolution, aka the Nearly Neutral Theory of molecular evolution, remains a central model to explain the main patterns of DNA polymorphism in natural populations. This is not to say that the quantitative fit to data is perfect. In a recent study CO_SCPLOWASTELLANOC_SCPLOW et al. (2018) used polymorphism data from D. melanogaster to test whether, as predicted by the Nearly Neutral Theory, the proportion of effectively neutral mutations depends on the effective population size (Ne). They showed that a nearly neutral model simply scaling with Ne variation across the genome could not explain alone the data but that consideration of linked positive selection improves the fit between observations and predictions. In the present article we extended their work in two main directions. First, we confirmed the observed pattern on a set of 59 species, including high quality genomic data from 11 animal and plant species with different mating systems and effective population sizes, hence a priori different levels of linked selection. Second, for the 11 species with high quality genomic data we also estimated the full Distribution of Fitness Effects (DFE) of mutations, and not solely the DFE of deleterious mutations. Both Ne and beneficial mutations contributed to the relationship between the proportion of effectively neutral mutations and local Ne across the genome. In conclusion, the predictions of the slightly deleterious model of molecular evolution hold well for species with small Ne. But for species with large Ne the fit is improved by incorporating linked positive selection to the model.",

    "abstract": "The multicomponent phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar-transporting phosphotransferase system (PTS) in Escherichia coli takes up sugar substrates and concomitantly phosphorylates them. We have recently provided evidence that many of the integral membrane PTS permeases interact with the fructose PTS (FruA/FruB) [1]. However, the biochemical and physiological significance of this finding was not known. We have carried out molecular genetic/biochemical/physiological studies that show that interactions of the fructose PTS often enhance, but sometimes inhibit the activities of other PTS transporters many fold, depending on the target PTS system under study. Thus, the glucose, mannose, mannitol and N- acetylglucosamine permeases exhibit enhanced in vivo sugar transport and sometimes in vitro PEP-dependent sugar phosphorylation activities while the galactitol and trehalose systems show inhibited activities. This is observed when the fructose system is induced to high levels and prevented when the fruA/fruB genes are deleted. Overexpression of the fruA and/or fruB genes in the absence of fructose induction during growth also enhances the rates of uptake of other hexoses. The {beta}-galactosidase activities of man, mtl, and gat-lacZ transcriptional fusions and the sugar-specific transphosphorylation activities of these enzyme transporters were not affected either by frustose induction or fruAB overexpression, showing that the rates of synthesis and protein levels in the membrane of the target PTS permeases were not altered. We thus suggest that specific protein-protein interactions within the cytoplasmic membrane regulate transport in vivo (and sometimes the PEP-dependent phosphorylation activities in vitro of PTS permeases) in a physiologically meaningful way that may help to provide a hierarchy of preferred PTS sugars. These observations appear to be applicable in principle to other types of transport systems as well.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical forces control many cellular processes by eliciting a mechanotransduction response in target cells. The initial steps of mechanotransduction at hemidesmosomes remain undefined in contrast to focal adhesions and adherens junctions. Here, we focus on the C. elegans plectin homolog VAB-10A, the only evolutionary conserved hemidesmosome component. In C. elegans, muscle contractions induce a mechanotransduction pathway in the epidermis through hemidesmosomes. We used CRISPR to precisely remove spectrin repeats (SR) or a partially hidden Src-homology-3 (SH3) domain within the VAB-10 plakin domain. Deleting the SH3 or SR8 domains in combination with mutations affecting mechanotransduction, or just part of SR5 shielding the SH3 domain induced embryonic elongation arrest because hemidesmosomes collapse. Notably, recruitment of GIT-1, the first mechanotransduction player, requires the SR5 domain and the hemidesmosome transmembrane receptor LET-805. Furthermore, Molecular Dynamics simulations confirmed that forces acting on VAB-10 can render the central SH3 domain, otherwise in contact with SR4, available for interaction. Collectively, our data strongly argue that the plakin domain plays a central role in mechanotransduction and raise the possibility that VAB-10/plectin might act as a mechanosensor.\\n\\nSummary statementCRISPR-derived deletions reveal the roles of three spectrin repeats and an atypical SH3 domain from the plakin domain of the VAB-10 hemidesmosome component in mechanotransduction during C. elegans morphogenesis",

    "abstract": "In this pilot study, we show that nuclei in spinal cord from ALS patients exhibit a differential lipidomic signature. Among the differential lipid species we could annotate 41 potential identities. These comprise membrane-bound lipids such as phosphatidylethanolamines-including plasmalogens- and phosphatidylcholines but also other lipid classes such as glycosphingolipids, diacylglycerols, and triacylglycerides (potentially present as nuclear lipid droplets). These results were orthogonally validated by showing loss of alkyldihydroxyacetonephosphate synthase (AGPS), a key peroxisomal enzyme in plasmalogen synthesis, both in ALS necropsy samples, in human motor neurons derived from iPSC from ALS patients and in hSOD-G93A transgenic mice. Further, diacylglycerol content changes were associated to ALS-linked variations in related-enzymes, such as phospholipase C {beta}I (PLC{beta}I), the source of nuclear diacylglycerol, and protein kinase C{beta}II (PKC{beta}II), whose function partially depends on nuclei concentration of diacylglycerol. These results point out for not only a role of nuclear membrane lipids but also to lipids present in the nucleoplasm, suggesting an undisclosed role for this part of the subcellular lipidome in ALS pathophysiology.",

It has been proposed that a form of cortical reorganization (changes in functional connectivity between brain areas) can be assessed with resting-state fMRI. Here we report the largest longitudinal data-set in terms of overall sessions in 19 patients with subcortical stroke and 11 controls. Patients were imaged up to 5 times over one year. We found no evidence for post-stroke cortical reorganization despite substantial behavioral recovery. These results could be construed as questioning the value of resting-state imaging.

    "abstract": "The Karnaphuli, a major river of Bangladesh, located off the coast of Chittagong in the Bay of Bengal is largely exposed to the heavy metal pollutants, which may be toxic to humans and aquatic fauna. The estuary is a striking example of a site where human pressure and ecological values collide with each other. In spite of being a major supplier of fish food for local community, there has been no study carried out to date to assess the potential human health risk due to heavy metal contamination in the fish species from this estuary. Therefore, the aim of present study was to assess bioaccumulation status and the potential human health risk evaluation for local consumers. Six commercially important fish species, Apocryptes bato, Pampus chinensis, Hyporhamphus limbatus, Liza parsia, Mugil cephalus, and Tenualosa toil from the Karnaphuli River estuary were collected to analyze heavy metals concentration level. Heavy metals As, Pb, Cd, Cr and Cu were detected from the samples using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (Model: ELAN9000, Perkin-Elmer, Germany). The hierarchy of the measured concentration level of the metals was as follows: Pb (mean: 13.88, range: 3.19 - 6.19) > Cu (mean: 12.10, range: 10.27 - 16.41) > As (mean: 4.89, range: 3.19 - 6.19) > Cr (mean: 3.36, range: 2.46 - 4.17) > Cd (mean: 0.39, range: 0.21 - 0.74). The Fultons condition factor denoted that organisms were particularly in better  condition and most of the species were in positive allometric growth. The Bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) observed in the species of the contaminants were organized in the following ranks: Cu (1971.42) > As (1042.93) > Pb (913.66) > Cr (864.99) > Cd (252.03), and among all the specimens, demersal fish, A. bato corresponded to the maximum bio-accumulative organism. Estimated daily intake (EDI), target hazard quotient (THQ) and carcinogenic risk (CR) assessed for human health risk implications suggest that the values are within the acceptable threshold for all sorts of consumers. Hence none of them would experience non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health effect for the ingestion of the fishes. However, children are shown to be largely susceptible than adults to non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health effect due to the consumption of fish. Therefore, an appropriate guidlines and robust management measures needed to be taken to restore the estuarine health condition for greater benefit of the quality of fish products for local consumption.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=114 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/681478v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (28K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@802d07org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10c300eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@126f608org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e28cf0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Animals employ multiple and distributed neuronal networks with diverse learning rules and synaptic plasticity dynamics to record distinct temporal and statistical information about the world. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this diversity are poorly understood. The anatomically defined compartments of the insect mushroom body function as parallel units of associative learning, with different learning rates, memory decay dynamics and flexibility (Aso & Rubin 2016). Here we show that nitric oxide (NO) acts as a neurotransmitter in a subset of dopaminergic neurons in Drosophila. NOs effects develop more slowly than those of dopamine and depend on soluble guanylate cyclase in postsynaptic Kenyon cells. NO acts antagonistically to dopamine; it shortens memory retention and facilitates the rapid updating of memories. The interplay of NO and dopamine enables memories stored in local domains along Kenyon cell axons to be specialized for predicting the value of odors based only on recent events. Our results provide key mechanistic insights into how diverse memory dynamics are established in parallel memory systems.",

    "abstract": "A continuous model for entrainment of the circadian clock responding to light/dark cycles is analytically studied. The circadian rhythm is entrained to light/dark cycles in a certain range of periods including the 24 hour period. Entrainment ranges vary among organisms; plants show much larger ranges than mammals. To analyze entrainment manners, we exploit a simplified model in which the angular velocity of the circadian rhythm is modulated by a sinusoidal function of phase difference between the circadian rhythm and reference phases. This model contains only one parameter called entrainment strength (K). For light and dark states, we set two reference phases. Using this model, we characterized the entrainment manners of circadian rhythms under non-24 hour light/dark cycles. The conditions of the K value for the entrainment were analytically calculated and a phase diagram showing entrainment/non-entrainment boundaries was drawn. In the diagram we found a region where disordered orbitals emerge. Then, critical values for the entrainment and the disordered irregular motion of the oscillation were derived. Simulation results near a critical value were comparable with the experimental results of the entrainment manners of plant circadian rhythms, suggesting the compatibility of self-oscillation and a strong light/dark response in plants. The diagram clearly represents an overview of the relationship between entrainment strengths and entrainment manners of circadian rhythms in general, and enables us to uniformly compare strengths of periodic stimuli in the environment and degrees of responsiveness for the stimuli among various circadian rhythms.",

It remains unclear, however, how condensin complexes work together to collectively package DNA into the chromosomal architecture. Here, we use time-lapse single-molecule visualization to study mutual interactions between two DNA-loop-extruding yeast condensins. We find that these one-side-pulling motor proteins are able to dynamically change each others DNA loop sizes, even when located large distances apart. When coming into close proximity upon forming a loop within a loop, condensin complexes are, surprisingly, able to traverse each other and form a new type of loop structure, which we term Z loop - three double-stranded DNA helices aligned in parallel with one condensin at each edge. These Z-loops can fill gaps left by single loops and can form symmetric dimer motors that reel in DNA from both sides. These new findings indicate that condensin may achieve chromosomal compaction using a variety of looping structures.",

    "abstract": "The phenomenon of ciliary coordination has garnered increasing attention in recent decades, with multiple theories accounting for its emergence in different contexts. The heterotrich ciliate Stentor coeruleus is a unicellular organism which boasts a number of features which present unrivalled opportunities for biophysical studies of cilia coordination. With their cerulean colour and distinctive morphology, these large protists possess a characteristic differentiation between cortical rows of short body cilia used for swimming, and an anterior ring structure of fused oral cilia forming a membranellar band. The oral cilia beat metachronously to produce strong feeding currents. In addition to this complex body plan, Stentor have remarkable regenerative capabilities. Minute fragments of single cells can over the period of hours or days, regenerate independently into new, proportional individuals. Certain environmental perturbations elicit a unique programmed response known as oral regeneration wherein only the membranellar band is shed and a new, ciliated oral primordium formed on the side of the body. Here, we target oral regeneration induced by sucrose-shock to reveal the complex interplay between ciliary restructuring and hydrodynamics in Stentor, which accompanies the complete developmental sequence from band formation, elongation, curling, and migration toward the cell anterior.\\n\\n\\\"When the anterior part is open, one may perceive about its Edges a very lively Motion; and when the Polyps presents itself in a certain manner, it discovers, on either side of these edges of its anterior part, somewhat very much resembling the wheels of a little Mill, that move with great velocity.\\\"\\n\\nA.

    "abstract": "The role of cellular metabolites in the direct control of signaling is an emerging and rapidly evolving field. Herein, we identify a key role for nuclear glycogen in epigenetic regulation through compartmentalized acetyl CoA production and histone acetylation. Nuclear glycogenolysis is dependent on ubiquitination and translocation of glycogen phosphorylase (GP) into the nucleus by malin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. We developed an innovative in organello stable isotope tracer method coupled to mass spectrometry analysis to define the metabolic fate of nuclear glycogen. This work revealed that GP is required for nuclear glycogen degradation and subsequent glycolysis to generate substrates for histone acetylation. Inhibition of nuclear glycogenolysis is found to be particularly important in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as evident by increased nuclear glycogen accumulation and malin suppression in NSCLC. Re-introduction of malin in model NSCLC cell lines restores nuclear glycogenolysis, resulting in increased histone acetylation and transcriptional changes that delay cancer cell growth in vivo. This study uncovers a previously unknown role for glycogen metabolism in the nucleus and elucidates another way by which cellular metabolites control epigenetic regulation.",

Here, we present a method for serial electron diffraction of protein nanocrystals combining the benefits of both approaches. In a scanning transmission electron microscope, crystals randomly dispersed on a sample grid are automatically mapped, and a diffraction pattern at fixed orientation is recorded from each at a high acquisition rate.

A biochemical network can be characterized by a multidimensional potential landscape based on the distribution of responses and a diffusion matrix of the correlated dynamic fluctuations between N-numbers of intracellular network variables. The Boltzmann H-function defines the rate of free energy dissipation of a network system and provides a framework for determining the heat associated with the nonequilibrium steady state and its network components. We conjecture that there is an upper limit to the rate of dissipative heat produced by a biological system, and we show that the dissipative heat has a lower bound. The magnitudes of the landscape gradients and the dynamic correlated fluctuations of network variables are experimentally accessible, and through an analysis that we refer to as Thermo-Fokker-Planck (Thermo-FP), provide insight into the composition of the network and the relative thermodynamic contributions from network components.

    "abstract": "BackgroundRecent developments in our understanding of the interactions between long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and cellular components have improved treatment approaches for various human diseases including cancer, vascular diseases, and neurological diseases. Although investigation of specific lncRNAs revealed their role in the metabolism of cellular RNA, our understanding of their contribution to post-transcriptional regulation is relatively limited. In this study, we explore the role of lncRNAs in modulating alternative splicing and their impact on downstream protein-RNA interaction networks.\\n\\nResultsAnalysis of alternative splicing events across 39 lncRNA knockdown and wildtype RNA-sequencing datasets from three human cell lines: HeLa (Cervical Cancer), K562 (Myeloid Leukemia), and U87 (Glioblastoma), resulted in high confidence (fdr < 0.01) identification of 11630 skipped exon events and 5895 retained intron events, implicating 759 genes to be impacted at post-transcriptional level due to the loss of lncRNAs. We observed that a majority of the alternatively spliced genes in a lncRNA knockdown were specific to the cell type, in tandem, the functions annotated to the genes affected by alternative splicing across each lncRNA knockdown also displayed cell type specificity. To understand the mechanism behind this cell-type specific alternative splicing patterns, we analyzed RNA binding protein (RBP)-RNA interaction profiles across the spliced regions, to observe cell type specific alternative splice event RBP binding preference.\\n\\nConclusionsDespite limited RBP binding data across cell lines, alternatively spliced events detected in lncRNA perturbation experiments were associated with RBPs binding in proximal intron-exon junctions, in a cell type specific manner. The cellular functions affected by alternative splicing were also affected in a cell type specific manner. Based on the RBP binding profiles in HeLa and K562 cells, we hypothesize that several lncRNAs are likely to exhibit a sponge effect in disease contexts, resulting in the functional disruption of RBPs, and their downstream functions. We propose that such lncRNA sponges can extensively rewire the post-transcriptional gene regulatory networks by altering the protein-RNA interaction landscape in a cell-type specific manner.",

    "abstract": "In cardiac myocytes, calcium cycling links the dynamics of the membrane potential to the activation of the contractile filaments. Perturbations of the calcium signalling toolkit have been demonstrated to disrupt this connection and lead to numerous pathologies including cardiac alternans. This rhythm disturbance is characterised by alternations in the membrane potential and the intracellular calcium concentration, which in turn can lead to sudden cardiac death. In the present computational study, we make further inroads into understanding this severe condition by investigating the impact of calcium buffers and L-type calcium channels on the formation of subcellular calcium alternans when calcium diffusion in the sarcoplasmic reticulum is strong. Through numerical simulations of a two dimensional network of calcium release units, we show that increasing calcium entry is proarrhythmogenic and that this is modulated by the calcium-dependent inactivation of the L-type calcium channel. We also find that while calcium buffers can exert a stabilising force and abolish subcellular Ca2+ alternans, they can significantly shape the spatial patterning of subcellular calcium alternans. Taken together, our results demonstrate that subcellular calcium alternans can emerge via various routes and that calcium diffusion in the sarcoplasmic reticulum critically determines their spatial patterns.",

    "abstract": "Here, we investigate the contributions of coevolutive, evolutive and stochastic information in determining protein-protein interactions (PPIs) based on primary sequences of two interacting protein families A and B. Specifically, under the assumption that coevolutive information is imprinted on the interacting amino acids of two proteins in contrast to other (evolutive and stochastic) sources spread over their sequences, we dissect those contributions in terms of compensatory mutations at physically-coupled and uncoupled amino acids of A and B. We find that physically-coupled amino-acids at short range distances store the largest per-contact mutual information content, with a significant fraction of that content resulting from coevolutive sources alone. The information stored in coupled amino acids is shown further to discriminate multi-sequence alignments (MSAs) with the largest expectation fraction of PPI matches - a conclusion that holds against various definitions of intermolecular contacts and binding modes. When compared to the informational content resulting from evolution at long-range interactions, the mutual information in physically-coupled amino-acids is the strongest signal to distinguish PPIs derived from cospeciation and likely, the unique indication in case of molecular coevolution in independent genomes as the evolutive information must vanish for uncorrelated proteins.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEThe problem of predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) based on multi-sequence alignments (MSAs) appears not completely resolved to date. In previous studies, one or more sources of information were taken into account not clarifying the isolated contributions of coevolutive, evolutive and stochastic information in resolving the problem. By benefiting from data sets made available in the sequence- and structure-rich era, we revisit the field to show that physically-coupled amino-acids of proteins store the largest (per contact) information content to discriminate MSAs with the largest expectation fraction of PPI matches - a result that should guide new developments in the field, aiming at characterizing protein interactions in general.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn this era of data science-driven bioinformatics, machine learning research has focused on feature selection as users want more interpretation and post-hoc analyses for biomarker detection. However, when there are more features (i.e., transcript) than samples (i.e., mice or human samples) in a study, this poses major statistical challenges in biomarker detection tasks as traditional statistical techniques are underpowered in high dimension. Second and third order interactions of these features pose a substantial combinatoric dimensional challenge. In computational biology, random forest1 (RF) classifiers are widely used2-7 due to their flexibility, powerful performance, and robustness to \"P predictors >> subjects N\" difficulties and their ability to rank features. We propose binomialRF, a feature selection technique in RFs that provides an alternative interpretation for features using a correlated binomial distribution and scales efficiently to analyze multiway interactions.\n\nMethodsbinomialRF treats each tree in a RF as a correlated but exchangeable binary trial. It determines importance by constructing a test statistic based on a features selection frequency to compute its rank, nominal p-value, and multiplicity-adjusted q-value using a one-sided hypothesis test with a correlated binomial distribution. A distributional adjustment addresses the co-dependencies among trees as these trees subsample from the same dataset. The proposed algorithm efficiently identifies multiway nonlinear interactions by generalizing the test statistic to count sub-trees.\n\nResultsIn simulations and in the Madelon benchmark datasets studies, binomialRF showed computational gains (up to 30 to 600 times faster) while maintaining competitive variable precision and recall in identifying biomarkers main effects and interactions. In two clinical studies, the binomialRF algorithm prioritizes previously-published relevant pathological molecular mechanisms (features) with high classification precision and recall using features alone, as well as with their statistical interactions alone.\n\nConclusionbinomialRF extends upon previous methods for identifying interpretable features in RFs and brings them together under a correlated binomial distribution to create an efficient hypothesis testing algorithm that identifies biomarkers main effects and interactions. Preliminary results in simulations demonstrate computational gains while retaining competitive model selection and classification accuracies. Future work will extend this framework to incorporate ontologies that provide path-way-level feature selection from gene expression input data.\n\nAvailabilityGithub: https://github.com/SamirRachidZaim/binomialRF\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary analyses and results are available at https://github.com/SamirRachidZaim/binomialRF_simulationStudy",

    "abstract": "Extant echinoderms show five-part radial symmetry in typical shape. However, we can find some asymmetry in their details, represented by the madreporite position not at the center, different skeletal arrangement in two of the five rays of sea urchins, and a circular cavity formed by two-end closure. We suspect the existence of any difference in hidden information between the five. In our hypothesis, deep equivalency makes no issue in function even after exchanging the position of rays; otherwise, this autograft causes some trouble in behavior or tissue formation. For this attempt, we firstly developed a method to transplant an arm tip to the counterpart of another arm in the sea star Patiria pectinifera. As a result, seven arms were completely implanted--four into the original positions for a control and three into different positions--with underwater surgery where we sutured with nylon thread and physically prevented nearby tube feet extending. Based on our external and internal observation, each grafted arm (i) gradually recovered movement coordination with the proximal body, (ii) regenerated its lost half as in usual distal regeneration, and (iii) formed no irregular intercalation filling any positional gap at the suture, no matter whether two cut arms were swapped. We here suggest a deep symmetry among the five rays of sea stars not only in morphology but also in physiology, representing an evolutionary strategy that has given equal priority to all the radial directions. Moreover, our methodological notes for grafting a mass of body in sea stars would help echinoderm research involving positional information as well as immunology.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological data report an association between obesity and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) 1-3. Furthermore, animal models demonstrate that maternal high fat diet (HFD) and maternal obesity increase susceptibility to IBD in the offsprings 4-8. However, the mechanisms that translate maternal obesity and HFD into increased susceptibility to IBD later in life remain unknown. Here we report that excess calorie intake by neonatal mice, as a consequence of maternal HFD, forced feeding of neonates or low litter competition, lead to an increase, during weaning, in intestinal permeability, expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and hydrogen sulfide production by the microbiota. In this context, intestinal permeability, cytokine expression and hydrogen sulfide engaged in a mutual positive feedback that imprinted increased susceptibility to colitis in the adult. This pathological imprinting was prevented by the neutralization of IFN{gamma} and TNF, of the production of hydrogen sulphide, or by normalization of intestinal permeability during weaning. Thus, excessive calorie intake by neonates leads to multiple causally-linked perturbations in the intestine that imprint the individual with long term susceptibility to IBD.",

    "abstract": "Rotavirus is a segmented double-stranded (ds)RNA virus that causes severe gastroenteritis in young children. We have established an efficient simplified rotavirus reverse genetics (RG) system that uses eleven T7 plasmids, each expressing a unique simian SA11 (+)RNA, and a CMV support plasmid for the African swine fever virus NP868R capping enzyme. With the NP868R-based system, we generated recombinant rotavirus (rSA11/NSP3-FL-UnaG) with a genetically modified 1.5-kB segment 7 dsRNA that encodes full-length NSP3 fused to UnaG, a 139-aa green fluorescent protein (FP). Analysis of rSA11/NSP3-FL-UnaG showed that the virus replicated efficiently and was genetically stable over 10 rounds of serial passage. The NSP3-UnaG fusion product was well expressed in rSA11/NSP3-FL-UnaG-infected cells, reaching levels similar to NSP3 in wildtype rSA11-infected cells. Moreover, the NSP3-UnaG protein, like functional wildtype NSP3, formed dimers in vivo. Notably, NSP3-UnaG protein was readily detected in infected cells via live cell imaging, with intensity levels ~3-fold greater than that of the NSP1-UnaG fusion product of rSA11/NSP1-FL-UnaG. Our results indicate that FP-expressing recombinant rotaviruses can be made through manipulation of the segment 7 dsRNA without deleting or interrupting any of the twelve open reading frames of the virus. Because NSP3 is expressed at levels higher than NSP1 in infected cells, rotaviruses expressing NSP3-based FPs may be a more sensitive tool for studying rotavirus biology than rotaviruses expressing NSP1-based FPs. This is the first report of a recombinant rotavirus containing a genetically engineered segment 7 dsRNA.\\n\\nImportancePrevious studies have generated recombinant rotaviruses that express fluorescent proteins (FPs) by inserting reporter genes into the NSP1 open reading frame (ORF) of genome segment 5. Unfortunately, NSP1 is expressed at low levels in infected cells, making viruses expressing FP-fused NSP1 less than ideal probes of rotavirus biology. Moreover, FPs were inserted into segment 5 in such a way as to compromise NSP1, an interferon antagonist affecting viral growth and pathogenesis. We have identified an alternative approach for generating rotaviruses expressing FPs, one relying on fusing the reporter gene to the NSP3 ORF of genome segment 7. This was accomplished without interrupting any of the viral ORFs, yielding recombinant viruses likely expressing the complete set of functional viral proteins. Given that NSP3 is made at moderate levels in infected cells, rotavirus encoding NSP3-based FPs should be more sensitive probes of viral infection than rotaviruses encoding NSP1-based FPs.",

    "abstract": "Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA) generates comprehensive yet complex mass spectrometric data, which imposes the use of data-dependent acquisition (DDA) libraries for deep peptide-centric detection. We here show that DIA can be redeemed from this dependency by combining predicted fragment intensities and retention times with narrow window DIA. This eliminates variation in library building and omits stochastic sampling, finally making the DIA workflow fully deterministic. Especially for clinical proteomics, this has the potential to facilitate inter-laboratory comparison.\n\nSignificance of the StudyData-independent acquisition (DIA) is quickly developing into the most comprehensive strategy to analyse a sample on a mass spectrometer. Correspondingly, a wave of data analysis strategies has followed suit, improving the yield from DIA experiments with each iteration. As a result, a worldwide wave of investments in DIA is already taking place in anticipation of clinical applications. Yet, there is considerable confusion about the most useful and efficient way to handle DIA data, given the plethora of possible approaches with little regard for compatibility and complementarity. In our manuscript, we outline the currently available peptide-centric DIA data analysis strategies in a unified graphic called the DIAmond DIAgram. This leads us to an innovative and easily adoptable approach based on predicted spectral information. Most importantly, our contribution removes what is arguably the biggest bottleneck in the field: the current need for Data Dependent Acquisition (DDA) prior to DIA analysis. Fractionation, stochastic data acquisition, processing and identification all introduce bias in the library. By generating libraries through data independent, i.e. deterministic acquisition, stochastic sampling in the DIA workflow is now fully omitted. This is a crucial step towards increased standardization. Additionally, our results demonstrate that a proteome-wide predicted spectral library can surrogate an exhaustive DDA Pan-Human library that was built based on 331 prior DDA runs.",

    "abstract": "The Syngap1 gene is a major regulator of synapse biology and neural circuit function. Genetic variants linked to epilepsy and intellectual disability disrupt synaptic function and neural excitability. The SynGAP protein has been involved in multiple signaling pathways and can regulate small GTPases with very different functions. Yet, the molecular bases behind this pleiotropy are poorly understood. We hypothesize that different SynGAP isoforms will mediate different sets of functions and that deciphering their spatio-temporal expression and subcellular localization will accelerate our understanding of the multiple functions performed by SynGAP. Using antibodies that detect all isoforms of SynGAP, we found that its subcellular localization changed throughout postnatal development. Consistent with previous reports, SynGAP was enriched in the postsynaptic density in the mature forebrain. However, this was age-dependent and SynGAP was predominantly found in non-synaptic locations in a period of postnatal development highly sensitive to SynGAP levels. Furthermore, we identified different expression patterns in the spatial and temporal axes for different SynGAP isoforms. Particularly noticeable was the delayed expression of SynGAP 1 isoforms, which bind to PSD-95 at the postsynaptic density, in cortex and hippocampus during the first two weeks of postnatal development. The subcellular localization of SynGAP was also isoform-dependent. While, 1 isoforms were highly enriched in the postsynaptic density, other C-terminal isoforms were less enriched or even more abundant in non-synaptic locations, particularly during the postnatal period. Thus, the regulation of expression and subcellular distribution of SynGAP isoforms may contribute to isoform-specific regulation of small GTPases, explaining SynGAP pleiotropy.",

    "abstract": "Spatial attention may be used to select target speech in one location while suppressing irrelevant speech in another. However, if perceptual resolution of spatial cues is weak, spatially focused attention may work poorly, leading to difficulty communicating in noisy settings. In electroencephalography (EEG), the distribution of alpha (8-14 Hz) power over parietal sensors reflects the spatial focus of attention (Banerjee et al., 2011; Foxe and Snyder, 2011). If spatial attention is degraded, however, alpha may not be modulated across parietal sensors. A previously published behavioral and EEG study found that, compared to normal-hearing (NH) listeners, hearing-impaired (HI) listeners often had higher interaural time difference (ITD) thresholds, worse performance when asked to report the content of an acoustic stream from a particular location, and weaker attentional modulation of neural responses evoked by sounds in a mixture (Dai et al., 2018). This study explored whether these same HI listeners also showed weaker alpha lateralization during the previously reported task. In NH listeners, hemispheric parietal alpha power was greater when the ipsilateral location was attended; this lateralization was stronger when competing melodies were separated by a larger spatial difference. In HI listeners, however, alpha was not lateralized across parietal sensors, consistent with a degraded ability to use spatial features to selectively attend.",

    "abstract": "Consumption of foods that are high in fat contributes to obesity and metabolism-related disorders that are increasing in prevalence and present an enormous health burden throughout the world. Dietary lipids are comprised of triglycerides and fatty acids, and the highly palatable taste of dietary fatty acids promotes food consumption, activates reward centers in mammals, and underlies hedonic feeding. Despite a central role of dietary fats in the regulation of food intake and the etiology of metabolic diseases, little is known about how fat consumption regulates sleep. The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, provides a powerful model system for the study of sleep and metabolic traits, and flies potently regulate sleep in accordance with food availability. To investigate the effects of dietary fats on sleep regulation, we have supplemented fatty acids into the diet of Drosophila and measured their effects on sleep and activity. We found that feeding flies a diet of hexanoic acid, a medium-chain fatty acid that is a by-product of yeast fermentation, promotes sleep by increasing the number of sleep episodes. This increase in sleep is dose-dependent and independent of the light-dark cues. Diets consisting of other fatty acids, including medium- and long-chain fatty acids, also increase sleep, suggesting many fatty acid types promote sleep. To assess whether dietary fatty acids regulate sleep through the taste system, we assessed sleep in flies with a mutation in the hexanoic acid receptor Ionotropic receptor 56d, which is required for fatty acid taste perception. We found that these flies also increase their sleep when fed a hexanoic acid diet, suggesting the sleep promoting effect of hexanoic acid is not dependent on sensory perception. Overall, these results define a role for fatty acids in sleep regulation, providing a foundation to investigate the molecular and neural basis for fatty acid-dependent modulation of sleep duration.",

To provide a vascularized and functional model of brain organoids, we demonstrated a new paradigm to generate vascularized organoids that consist of typical human cortical cell types and recapitulate the lamination of the neocortex with a vascular structure formation for over 200 days. In addition, the observation of the sEPSCs (spontaneous Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential) and sIPSCs (spontaneous Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential) and the bidirectional electrical transmission indicated the presence of chemical and electrical synapses in the vOrganoids. More importantly, the single-cell RNA-seq analysis illustrated that the vOrganoids exhibited microenvironments to promote neurogenesis and neuronal maturation that resembled in vivo processes. The transplantation of the vOrganoids to the mouse S1 cortex showed human-mouse co-constructed functional blood vessels in the grafts that could promote the survival and integration of the transplanted cells to the host. This vOrganoid culture method could not only serve as a model to study human cortical development and to explore brain disease pathology but could also provide potential prospects for new cell therapies for neural system disorders and injury.",

    "abstract": "The Amazon basin is host to numerous arthropod-borne viral pathogens that cause febrile disease in humans. Among these, Oropouche orthobunyavirus (OROV) is a relatively understudied member of the Peribunyavirales that causes periodic outbreaks in human populations in Brazil and other South American countries. Although several studies have described the genetic diversity of the virus, the evolutionary processes that shape the viral genome remain poorly understood. Here we present a comprehensive study of the genomic dynamics of OROV that encompasses phylogenetic analysis, evolutionary rate estimates, inference of natural selective pressures, recombination and reassortment, and structural analysis of OROV variants. Our study includes all available published sequences, as well as a set of new OROV genomes sequences obtained from patients in Ecuador, representing the first set of viral genomes from this country. Our results show that differing evolutionary processes on the three segments that encompass the viral genome lead to variable evolutionary rates and TMRCAs that could be explained by cryptic reassortment. We also present the discovery of previously unobserved putative N-linked glycosylation sites, and codons which evolve under positive selection on the viral surface proteins, and discuss the potential role of these features in the evolution of the virus through a combined phylogenetic and structural approach.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a malignant cancer with high incidence and mortality in the world, as the result of the traditional treatments. Immunotherapy targeting neoantigens can induce durable tumor regression in cancer patients, but is almost limited to individual treatment, resulting from the unique neoantigens. Many shared oncogenic mutations are detected, but whether the common neoantigens can be identified in CRC is unknown. Using the somatic mutations data from 321 CRC patients combined with a filter standard and 7 predicted algorithms, we screened and obtained 25 HLA-A*11:01 restricted common neoantigens with high binding affinity (IC50<50 nM) and presentation score (>0.9). Except the positive epitope KRAS_G12V8-16, 11 out of 25 common neoantigens were proved to be naturally processed and presented on constructed K562 cell surface by mass spectroscopy (MS), and 11 out of 25 common neoantigens specifically induced in vitro pre-stimulated cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) to secrete IFN-{gamma}. However, only 2 out of 25 common neoantigens were simultaneously presented and immunogenic. Moreover, using cell-sorting technology combined with single-cell RNA sequencing, the immune repertoire profiles of C1orf170_S418G413-421 and KRAS_G12V8-16-specific CTL were clarified. Therefore, common neoantigens with presentation and immunogenicity could be found in CRC, which would be developed as the universal targets for CRC immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "The recurrent emergence of drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum increases the urgency to genetically validate drug resistance mechanisms and identify new targets. Reverse genetics have facilitated genome-scale knockout screens in Plasmodium berghei and Toxoplasma gondii, in which pooled transfections of multiple vectors were critical to increasing scale and throughput. These approaches have not yet been implemented in P. falciparum, mainly because the extent to which pooled transfections can be performed in this species still remains unknown. Here we use next-generation sequencing to quantitate uptake of a pool of 94 barcoded vectors. The distribution of vectors in different transfections allowed us to estimate the number of barcodes and DNA molecules taken up by the parasite population. Dilution cloning showed that single transfected parasites routinely carry as many as seven episomal barcodes, revealing an intake of multiple vectors in a highly non-uniform fashion. Transfection of non-overlapping fluorescent proteins, which allowed us to follow the dynamics of the process, confirmed the tendency for parasites to take up multiple vectors from the early stages of transfection. This finding has important implications for how reverse genetics can be scaled in P. falciparum.",

    "abstract": "Top-down spatial attention is effective at selecting a target sound from a mixture. However, non-spatial features often distinguish sources in addition to location. This study explores whether redundant non-spatial features are used to maintain selective auditory attention for a spatially defined target. We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) while subjects focused attention on one of three simultaneous melodies. In one experiment, subjects (n = 17) were given an auditory cue indicating both the location and pitch of the target melody. In a second experiment (n = 17 subjects), the cue only indicated target location, and we compared two conditions: one in which the pitch separation of competing melodies was large, and one in which this separation was small. In both experiments, responses evoked by onsets of events in sound streams were modulated equally as strong by attention, suggesting that the target stimuli were correctly selected regardless of the cue or pitch information available. In all cases, parietal alpha was lateralized following the cue, but prior to melody onset, indicating that subjects always initially focused attention in space. During the stimulus presentation, however, this lateralization weakened when pitch cues were strong, suggesting that strong pitch cues reduced reliance on sustained spatial attention. These results demonstrate that once a well-defined target stream at a known location is selected, top-down spatial attention is unnecessary to filter out a segregated competing stream.",

While much work has been done in ascertaining cell-type fractions and removing cell-type heterogeneity variation, relatively little work has been done in identifying cell-type specific variation in heterogeneous samples.\\n\\nResultsIn this paper, we present a Bayesian model-based approach for making cell-type specific inferences in heterogeneous settings, by using a logit-Normal sampling distribution and incorporating a priori knowledge of cell-type lineage. The method is applied to the detection of cell-type specific sex effects in methylation, where cell-type information is present as an independent verification of the results. Panels derived from this method contained more loci where CD8+T, CD19+B and Natural Killer cell-types were differentially methylated. The analysis suggests that an ensemble approach with this method included could be used for discovering cell-type specific methylation changes.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/danwkenn/Bayes_CDM",

We report three broadly reactive human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting N1 NA. Two were isolated from a young adult vaccinated with trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV), which inhibited N1 NA from viruses isolated from human over a period of a hundred years. The third antibody isolated from a child with acute mild H7N9 infection inhibited both group 1 N1 and group 2 N9 NAs. In addition, the antibodies cross-inhibited the N1 NAs of highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza viruses. These antibodies are protective in prophylaxis against seasonal H1N1 viruses in mice.

    "abstract": "The consolidation and retrieval of remote memories depend on the coordinated activity of the hippocampus and frontal cortices. However, the exact time at which these regions are recruited to support memory and the interactions between them are still debated. Astrocytes can sense and modify neuronal activity with great precision, but their role in cognitive function has not been extensively explored. To investigate the role of astrocytes in remote memory we expressed the Gi-coupled receptor hM4Di in CA1 astrocytes, allowing their manipulation by a designer drug. We discovered that astrocytic modulation during learning resulted in a specific impairment in remote, but not recent, memory recall, accompanied by decreased neuronal activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during retrieval. We revealed a massive recruitment of ACC-projecting neurons in CA1 during memory acquisition, accompanied by activation of ACC neurons. Astrocytic Gi activation disrupted CA3 to CA1 communication in-vivo, and reduced the downstream response in the ACC. This same manipulation in behaving mice induced a projection-specific inhibition of ACC-projecting CA1 neurons during learning, consequently preventing the recruitment of the ACC. Our findings suggest that the foundation of remote memory is established in the ACC during acquisition, engaging a distinct process from the one supporting consolidation of recent memory. Furthermore, the mechanism underlying remote memory involves projection-specific functions of astrocytes in regulating neuronal activity.",

    "abstract": "Both geomagnetic and solar activity fluctuate over time and have been proposed to affect human physiology. One physiological measurement that has been previously investigated in this context, heart rate variability (HRV), has substantial health implications regarding the ability to adapt to stressors and has been shown to be altered in many cardiovascular and neurological disorders. Intriguingly, previous work found significant, strong correlations between HRV and geomagnetic/solar activity. In an attempt to replicate these findings, we simultaneously measured HRV from 20 healthy participants during a thirty-day period. In agreement with previous work, we found several significant correlations between HRV and geophysical time-series. However, after correction for autocorrelation, which is inherent in time-series, the only significant results were an increase in very low frequency during higher local geomagnetic activity and a geomagnetic anticipatory decrease in heart rate a day before higher global geomagnetic activity. Both correlations were very low. The loss of most significant effects after this correction suggests that previous findings may be a result of autocorrelation. A further note of caution is required since our and the previous studies in the field do not correct for multiple comparisons given the exploratory analysis strategy. We thus conclude that the effects of geomagnetic and solar activity are (if present) most likely of very small effect size and question the validity of the previous studies given the methodological concerns we have uncovered in our work.",

    "abstract": "Human observers perceptually discriminate the dynamic deformation of materials in the real world. However, the psychophysical and neural mechanisms responsible for the perception of dynamic deformation have not been fully elucidated. By using a deforming bar as the stimulus, we showed that the spatial frequency of deformation was a critical determinant of deformation perception. Simulating the response of direction-selective units (i.e., MT pattern motion cells) to stimuli, we found that the perception of dynamic deformation was well explained by assuming a higher-order mechanism monitoring the spatial pattern of direction responses. Our model with the higher-order mechanism also successfully explained the appearance of a visual illusion wherein a static bar apparently deforms against a tilted drifting grating. In particular, it was the lower spatial frequencies in this pattern that strongly contributed to the deformation perception. Finally, by manipulating the luminance of the static bar, we observed that the mechanism for the illusory deformation was more sensitive to luminance than contrast cues.\n\nSignificance StatementFrom the psychophysical and computational points of view, the present study tried to answer the question, \"how do human observers see deformation?\". In the psychophysical experiment, we used a clip wherein a bar dynamically deformed. We also tested the illusory deformation of a bar, which was caused by tilted drifting grating, because it was unclear whether the illusory deformation could be described by our model. In the computational analysis, in order to explain psychophysical data for deformation perception, it was necessary to assume an additional unit monitoring the spatial pattern of direction responses of MT cells that were sensitive to local image motion.",

Although environmental factors tend to invoke miserableness, it is common to feel miserable  for no reason, suggesting an innate, potential genetic component. Currently, little is known about the functional relevance of common variants associated with miserableness. To further characterize the trait, we conducted a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) on 373,733 individuals and identified 104 signals across brain tissue panels with 37 unique genes. Subsequent probabilistic fine-mapping prioritized 95 genes into 90%-credible sets.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that many GWAS hits for miserableness are driven by expression.

    "abstract": "Bacillus subtilis forms highly resistant, metabolically inactive dormant spores upon nutrient limitation. These endospores pose challenges to the food and medical sectors. Spores reactivate their metabolism upon contact with germinants and develop into vegetative cells. The activation of the molecular machinery that triggers the progress of germination and spore outgrowth is still unsettled. To gain further insight in spore germination and outgrowth processes, the transcriptome and proteome changeover during spore germination and outgrowth to vegetative cells, was analysed. B. subtilis transcriptome analysis allow us to trace the different functional groups of genes expressed. For each time-point sample, the change in the spore proteome was quantitatively monitored relative to the reference proteome of 15N metabolically labelled vegetative cells. We observed until the phase transition, i.e. completion of germination, no significant change in the proteome. We have identified 36 transcripts present abundantly in the dormant spores. This number is in close agreement with the previous findings. These transcripts mainly belong to the genes encoding small acid soluble proteins (sspE, sspO, sspI, sspK, sspF) and proteins with uncharacterized functions. We observed in total 3152 differentially expressed genes, but  only 323 differentially expressed proteins (total 451 proteins identified and quantified). Our data shows that 173 proteins from dormant spores, both spore unique proteins and protein shared with vegetative cells, are lost during the phase transitioning period. This loss is in addition to the active protein degradation, undertaken by the spore proteases such as Gpr, as germination and outgrowth proceeds. Further analysis is required to functionally interpret the observed protein loss. The observed diverse timing of the synthesis of different protein sets reveals a putative core-strategy of the revival of  life starting from the B. subtilis spore.",

Here, we investigate the symmetry of membrane addition in the mid-plane and DNA segregation using a video-microscopy approach. We find the membrane expansion dynamics to be asymmetric based on mid-cell photobleaching landmarks in FM4-64, used to stain the membrane. The apparent growth bias of E. coli does not correspond to the age of the pole. We find the membrane growth asymmetry is correlated to nucleoid displacement, consistent with ideas of coupling of cell growth and nucleoid positioning. The mobility of the actin-homolog MreB also correlates with membrane growth asymmetry, based on fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) measurements of a YFP-fusion. These correlations suggest the small asymmetry of membrane addition observed could potentially drive nucleoid segregation and MreB mobility asymmetry in E. coli.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEAsymmetry in bacterial cell division is seen in its most simple form in the binomial event of protein segregation that results in  noise in equal segregation and depends on the protein copy number. In the case of specific proteins this can also affect growth, and result in differentiation. However, during the asexual division of Escherichia coli single cells are thought to grow symmetrically and divide equally. We find a slight but consistent asymmetry in growth based on quantitative morphometry of cell pole displacement in time-series of growing E. coli cells. Increased cell wall extension in one half of the cell over the other appears to explain the asymmetry in the displacement of cell poles. Interestingly the growth asymmetry is not correlated to the age of the pole (old and new). This observed asymmetry appears to correlate with the asymmetry of nucleoid segregation, resulting in the nucleoids finding the midpoints of the respective daughter cells, and formation of the septum at the geometric centre of the elongated cell just prior to division. The mobility dynamics of the cytoskeletal protein MreB, which organizes the cell membrane, is are more dynamic where membrane growth is faster. Thus we propose a linkage between this observed growth asymmetry and that of MreB dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Adjacent neurons in visual cortex have overlapping receptive fields within and across area boundaries, an arrangement which is theorized to minimize wiring cost. This constraint is thought to create retinotopic maps of opposing field sign (mirror and non-mirror representations of the visual field) in adjacent visual areas, a concept which has become central in current attempts to subdivide the cortex. We modelled a realistic developmental scenario in which adjacent areas do not mature simultaneously, but need to maintain topographic continuity across their borders. This showed that the same mechanism that is hypothesized to maintain topographic continuity within each area can lead to a more complex type of retinotopic map, consisting of sectors with opposing field sign within a same area. Using fully quantitative electrode array recordings, we then demonstrate that this type of map exists in the primate extrastriate cortex.",

    "abstract": "It is now appreciated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important players in the orchestration of cancer progression. In this study we characterized GHSROS, a human lncRNA gene on the opposite DNA strand (antisense) to the ghrelin receptor gene, in prostate cancer. The lncRNA was upregulated by prostate tumors from different clinical datasets. Consistently, transcriptome data revealed that GHSROS alters the expression of cancer-associated genes. Functional analyses in vitro showed that GHSROS mediates tumor growth, migration, and survival and resistance to the cytotoxic drug docetaxel. Increased cellular proliferation of GHSROS-overexpressing PC3, DU145, and LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines in vitro was recapitulated in a subcutaneous xenograft model. Conversely, in vitro antisense oligonucleotide inhibition of the lncRNA reciprocally regulated cell growth and migration, and gene expression. Notably, GHSROS modulates the expression of PPP2R2C, the loss of which may drive androgen receptor pathway-independent prostate tumor progression in a subset of prostate cancers. Collectively, our findings suggest that GHSROS can reprogram prostate cancer cells toward a more aggressive phenotype and that this lncRNA may represent a potential therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "High-latitude countries tend to contain the polar range-edge of many species that are nationally rare but globally common. This can focus national conservation efforts toward range-edge populations, whose conservation needs and value are disputed. Using plants in Canada as a case study, we ask whether national species-conservation rankings prioritize range-edge populations, and whether conservation priority is matched by habitat protection and research effort. We found that >75% of federally-protected plants only occur in Canada peripherally, at the northernmost 20% or less of their total range, and that the most imperilled taxa had the smallest percentage of their range in Canada (endangered plants: median=1.0%). Occurring peripherally in Canada was associated with higher threat even after accounting for range area, potentially because range-edge taxa experienced 85% higher human population densities in their Canadian range than non-peripheral taxa. High conservation priority was not matched by habitat protection, as more imperilled and more peripheral taxa had smaller fractions of their Canadian range in protected areas. Finally, peer-reviewed research on plants at-risk in Canada was low. Only 42% of plants considered at-risk in Canada had been studied in Canada, and only 11% of species with large distributions outside Canada had been studied in the context of their wider geographic range--information that is critical to establishing their relative conservation value. Our results illustrate that plant conservation in Canada is fundamentally linked to conserving range-edge populations, yet edge populations themselves are understudied, a research gap we must close to improve evidence-based conservation.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive locomotion of living organisms contributes to their competitive abilities and helps maintain their fitness in diverse environments. To date, however, our understanding of searching behavior and its ultimate cause remains poorly understood in ecology and biology. Here, we investigate motion patterns of biofilm-inhabiting marine raphid diatom Navicula arenaria var. rostellata in two-dimensional space. We report that individual Navicula cells display a \"circular run-and-reversal\" movement behavior at different concentrations of dissolved silicic acid (dSi). We show that gliding motions of cells can be predicted accurately with a universal Langevin model. Our experimental results are consistent with an optimal foraging strategy and a maximized diffusivity of the theoretical outcomes in which both circular-run and reversal behaviors are important ingredients. Our theoretical results suggest that the evolving movement behaviors of diatoms may be driven by optimization of searching behavioral strategy, and predicted behavioral parameters coincide with the experimental observations. These optimized movement behaviors are an evolutionarily stable strategy to cope with environmental complexity.\n\nONE SENTENCE SUMMARYNovel experiments and modelling reveal that raphid diatoms can actively exploit resources in complex environments by adjusting their movement behavior.",

Opportunities to apply MR are growing rapidly with the number of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with publicly available results. However, existing MR methods rely on strong assumptions that are often violated, leading to false positives. Many methods have been proposed loosening these assumptions. However, it has remained challenging to account for correlated pleiotropy, which arises when variants affect both traits through a heritable shared factor. We propose a new MR method, Causal Analysis Using Summary Effect Estimates (CAUSE), that accounts for correlated and uncorrelated horizontal pleiotropic effects. We demonstrate in simulations that CAUSE is more robust to correlated pleiotropy than other methods. Applied to traits studied in recent GWAS, we find that CAUSE detects causal relationships with strong literature support and avoids identifying most unlikely relationships. Our results suggest that many pairs of traits identified as causal using alternative methods may be false positives due to horizontal pleiotropy.",

To date, animal models of Alzheimers have focused on rare familial mutations, due to a lack of frank neuropathology from models based on common disease genes. Recent multi-cohort studies of postmortem human brain transcriptomes have identified a set of 30 gene co-expression modules associated with LOAD, providing a molecular catalog of relevant endophenotypes.\\n\\nResultsThis resource enables precise gene-based alignment between new animal models and human molecular signatures of disease. Here, we describe a new resource to efficiently screen mouse models for LOAD relevance. A new NanoString nCounter(R) Mouse AD panel was designed to correlate key human disease processes and pathways with mRNA from mouse brains. Analysis of three mouse models based on LOAD genetics, carrying APOE4 and TREM2*R47H alleles, demonstrated overlaps with distinct human AD modules that, in turn, are functionally enriched in key disease-associated pathways. Comprehensive comparison with full transcriptome data from same-sample RNA-Seq shows strong correlation between gene expression changes independent of experimental platform.\\n\\nConclusionsTaken together, we show that the nCounter Mouse AD panel offers a rapid, cost-effective and highly reproducible approach to assess disease relevance of potential LOAD mouse models.",

    "abstract": "Precise investigation of the temperature and the duration for collagen denaturation is critical for a number of applications, such as adjustment of temperature and duration during a laser-assisted tissue welding or collagen-based tissue repair products (films, implants, cross-linkers) preparation procedures. The result of such studies can serve as a guideline to mitigate potential side effects while maintaining the functionality of the collagen. Though a variety of collagen denaturation temperatures have been reported, there has not been a systematic study to report temperature-dependent denaturation rates. In this study, we perform a set of experiments on type-I collagen fiber bundles, extracted from the rat-tail tendon, and provide an Arrhenius model based on the acquired data. The tendons are introduced to buffer solutions having different temperatures, while monitoring the contrast in the crimp sights with a wide field microscope, where collagen fibers bend with respect to their original orientation. For all tested temperatures of 50{degrees}C-70 {degrees}C and tissues that were extracted from 5 rats, increasing the temperature reduced the contrast. On the average, we observed a decay of the contrast to half of its initial value at 37, 157, and 266 seconds when the collagen was introduced to 70 {degrees}C, 65 {degrees}C, and 60 {degrees}C buffer solutions, respectively. For the lower temperatures tested we only observed to be only about 20% and 2 % decay in the crimp contrast after > 2 hours at 55 {degrees}C and 50 {degrees}C, respectively. The observed denaturation behavior is also in line with Arrhenius Law, as expected. We are looking forward to expand this study to other types of collagen as a future work. Overall, with further development the data and model we present here could potentially serve as a guideline to determine limits for welding and manufacturing process of collagen-based tissue repair agents.",

    "abstract": "Graph based non-linear reference structures such as variation graphs and colored de Bruijn graphs enable incorporation of full genomic diversity within a population. However, transitioning from a simple string-based reference to graphs requires addressing many computational challenges, one of which concerns accurately mapping sequencing read sets to graphs. Paired-end Illumina sequencing is a commonly used sequencing platform in genomics, where the paired-end distance constraints allow disambiguation of repeats. Many recent works have explored provably good index-based and alignment-based strategies for mapping individual reads to graphs. However, validating distance constraints efficiently over graphs is not trivial, and existing sequence to graph mappers rely on heuristics. We introduce a mathematical formulation of the problem, and provide a new algorithm to solve it exactly. We take advantage of the high sparsity of reference graphs, and use sparse matrix-matrix multiplications (SpGEMM) to build an index which can be queried efficiently by a mapping algorithm for validating the distance constraints. Effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated using real reference graphs, including a human MHC variation graph, and a pan-genome de-Bruijn graph built using genomes of 20 B. anthracis strains. While the one-time indexing time can vary from a few minutes to a few hours using our algorithm, answering a million distance queries takes less than a second.\\n\\n2012 ACM Subject ClassificationMathematics of computing [-&gt;] Paths and connectivity problems; Applied computing [-&gt;] Computational genomics",

    "abstract": "Mutations in p53 protein, especially in the DNA binding domain is one of the major hallmarks of cancer. The R273 position is a DNA contact position and has several oncogenic variants. Surprisingly, cancer patients carrying different mutant-variants of R273 in p53 have different survival rates indicating that the DNA contact inhibition may not be the sole reason for reduced survival with R273 variants. Here, we probed the structural properties of three major oncogenic variants of the R273: ([R273L], [R273H], and [R273C])p53. Using a series of biophysical, biochemical and theoretical simulation studies, we observe that these oncogenic variants of the p53 not only suffer a loss in DNA binding, but also show distinct structural stabilty, aggregation and toxicity profiles. [R273C]p53 shows maximum amyloidogenicity while [R273L]p53 shows maximum aggregation. Further probe in the aggregation mechanism show that [R273C]p53 aggregation is disulphide mediated whereas hydrophobic interactions dominate self-assembly in [R273L]p53. MD simulation studies clearly show that -helical intermediates are observed in [R273C]p53 whereas {beta}-sheets are observed for [R273L]p53. Our study indicates that each of the R273 variant has its own distinct property of stability and self-assembly, the molecular basis of which, may lead to different types of cancer pathogenesis in vivo. These studies will aid the design of therapeutic strategies for cancer using residue specific or process specific protein aggregation as target.\\n\\nStatement of significanceThe present work stems from an interesting observation that genetic mutations that results in switching of one amino acid to different variants at the same codon show different cancer cell progression. We are trying to understand the molecular reason behind the different gain-of-function opted by these variants. With the help of biophysical and biochemical experiments, and computational studies we have observed that the different thermal stability, unique mechanism of unfolding and self-assembly might be one of the crucial parameters for their different oncogenic effect. These studies thus call for the need of developing therapeutic strategies that consider the resultant mutant-variant as a target rather than mutation position. This is an important lead towards the understanding of cancer.",

We also demonstrate that machine learning can improve target-specificity by the modular composition of models from different experimental campaigns, enabling a new integrative approach to improving target specificity.

    "abstract": "Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are important symbionts of plants. Recently, studies of the AMF Rhizophagus irregularis recorded within-isolate genetic variation that does not completely match the proposed homokaryon or heterokaryon state (where heterokaryons comprise a population of two distinct nucleus genotypes). We re-analysed published data showing that bi-allelic sites (and their frequencies), detected in proposed homo- and heterokaryote R. irregularis isolates, were similar across independent studies using different techniques. This indicated that observed within-fungus genetic variation was not an artefact of sequencing and that such within-fungus genetic variation possibly exists. We looked to see if bi-allelic transcripts from three R. irregularis isolates matched those observed in the genome as this would give a strong indication of whether bi-allelic sites recorded in the genome were reliable variants. In putative homokaryon isolates, very few bi-allelic transcripts matched those in the genome. In a putative heterokaryon, a large number of bi-allelic transcripts matched those in the genome. Bi-allelic transcripts also occurred in the same frequency in the putative heterokaryon as predicted from allele frequency in the genome. Our results indicate that while within-fungus genome variation in putative homokaryon and heterokaryon AMF was highly similar in 2 independent studies, there was little support that this variation is transcribed in homokaryons. In contrast, within-fungus variation thought to be segregated among two nucleus genotypes in a heterokaryon isolate was indeed transcribed in a way that is proportional to that seen in the genome.",

An induced reduction of PUF3 in bloodstream forms caused a slight growth defect and slightly delayed differentiation to the procyclic form, but the cells lost both defects upon prolonged cultivation. Both PUF3 genes could also be deleted in bloodstream-form and procyclic-form trypanosomes, suggesting that in vitro, at least, these life-cycle stages do not require PUF3. Procyclic forms without PUF3 grew somewhat slower than wild-type, but were able to transform to bloodstream forms after induced expression of the bloodstream-form RNA-binding protein RBP10. In contrast, ectopic expression of C-terminally tagged PUF3 in procyclic forms impaired viability. There was little evidence for specific binding of PUF3 to bloodstream-form mRNAs and RNAi had no significant effect on the transcriptome. Moreover, mass spectrometry revealed no PUF3 binding partners that might explain its suppressive activity. Since PUF3 is conserved in all Kinetoplastids, we suggest that it might be required within the invertebrate host, or perhaps implicated in fine-tuning gene expression.",

We found that remapping cells exhibited distinct features not present in stable cells. During memory encoding, their theta phase preferences shifted to earlier phases, when CA3 inputs are strongest. Further, their recruitment into replay events increased during learning, unlike that of stable cells. Our demonstration of a sub-population of place cells identified on the basis of their degree of remapping and exhibiting unique changes in their spike firing properties with learning lend support to a model in which novel and familiar spatial/contextual information is encoded and maintained, respectively, by separate place cell populations.",

    "abstract": "Entering mitosis, the genome is restructured to facilitate chromosome segregation, accompanied by dramatic changes in gene expression. However, the mechanisms that underlie mitotic transcriptional regulation are unclear. In contrast to transcribed genes, centromere regions retain transcriptionally active RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) in mitosis. Here, we demonstrate that chromatin-bound cohesin is sufficient to retain RNAPII at centromeres while WAPL-mediated removal of cohesin during prophase is required for RNAPII dissociation from chromosome arms. Failure to remove cohesin from chromosome arms results in a failure to release elongating RNAPII and nascent transcripts from mitotic chromosomes and dramatically alters gene expression. We propose that prophase cohesin removal is the key step in reprogramming gene expression as cells transition from G2 to mitosis, and is temporally coupled with chromosome condensation to coordinate chromosome segregation with changes in gene expression.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIMitotic centromere transcription requires cohesin\\nC_LIO_LICohesin removal releases elongating RNA Pol II and nascent RNA from chromatin\\nC_LIO_LIThe prophase pathway reprograms gene expression during mitosis\\nC_LI",
