    "abstract": "Arabidopsis is an important model organism and the first plant with its genome sequenced. Knowledge from studying this species has either direct or indirect applications to agriculture and human health. Quantitative proteomics by data-independent acquisition (SWATH/DIA-MS) was recently developed and considered as a high-throughput targetedlike approach for accurate proteome quantitation. In this approach, a high-quality and comprehensive library is a prerequisite. Here, we generated a protein expression atlas of 10 organs of Arabidopsis and created a library consisting of 15,514 protein groups, 187,265 unique peptide sequences, and 278,278 precursors. The identified protein groups correspond to ~56.5% of the predicted proteome. Further proteogenomics analysis identified 28 novel proteins. We subsequently applied DIA-mass spectrometry using this library to quantify the effect of abscisic acid on Arabidopsis. We were able to recover 8,793 protein groups with 1,787 of them being differentially expressed which includes 65 proteins known to respond to abscisic acid stress. Mass spectrometry data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD012710 for data-dependent acquisition and PXD014032 for DIA analyses.\\n\\nO_TBL View this table:\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a3f799org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d4711dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4e3f73org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@127a9a4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f254bb_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_TBL C_TBL",

    "abstract": "In the cell, proteins are synthesized from N- to C-terminus and begin to fold during translation. Co-translational folding mechanisms are therefore linked to elongation rate, which varies as a function of synonymous codon usage. However, synonymous codon substitutions can affect many distinct cellular processes, which has complicated attempts to deconvolve the extent to which synonymous codon usage can promote or frustrate proper protein folding in vivo. Although previous studies have shown that some synonymous changes can lead to different final structures, other substitutions will likely be more subtle, perturbing predominantly the protein folding pathway without radically altering the final structure. Here we show that synonymous codon substitutions encoding a single essential enzyme lead to dramatically slower cell growth. These mutations do not prevent active enzyme formation; instead, they predominantly alter the protein folding mechanism, leading to enhanced degradation in vivo. These results support a model where synonymous codon substitutions can impair cell fitness by significantly perturbing co-translational protein folding mechanisms, despite the chaperoning provided by the cellular protein homeostasis network.\\n\\nSignificanceMany proteins that are incapable of refolding in vitro nevertheless fold efficiently to their native state in the cell. This suggests that more information than the amino acid sequence is required to properly fold these proteins. Here we show that synonymous mRNA mutations can alter a protein folding mechanism in vivo, leading to changes in cellular fitness. This work demonstrates that synonymous codon selection can play an important role in supporting efficient protein production in vivo.",

    "abstract": "MotivationIdentification of biological pathways plays a central role in understanding both human health and diseases. Although much work has previously been done to explore the biological pathways by using single omics data, little effort has been reported using multi-omics data integration, mainly due to methodological and technological limitations. Compared to single omics data, multi-omics data will help identifying disease specific functional pathways with both higher sensitivity and specificity, thus gaining more comprehensive insights into the molecular architecture of disease processes.\\n\\nResultsIn this paper, we propose two computational approaches that integrate multi-omics data and identify disease-specific biological pathways with high sensitivity and specificity. Applying our methods to an experimental multi-omics data dataset on muscular dystrophy subtypes, we identified disease-specific pathways of high biological plausibility. The developed methodology will likely have a broad impact on improving the molecular characterization of many common diseases.\\n\\nContactyuewang@vt.edu\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary information attached.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIncreased Nuchal Translucency (NT) is an important biomarker associated with increased risk of fetal structural anomalies. It is known to be contributed by a wide range of genetic etiologies from single nucleotide variants to those affecting millions of base-pairs. Currently, prenatal diagnosis is routinely performed by karyotyping and chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), however, both of them have limited resolution. The diversity of the genetic etiologies warrants an integrated assay such as genome sequencing (GS) for comprehensive detection of genomic variants. Herein, we aim to evaluate the feasibility of applying GS in prenatal diagnosis for the fetuses with increased NT.\\n\\nMethodsWe retrospectively applied GS (>30-fold) for fetuses with increased NT ([&ge;]3.5-mm), who underwent routine prenatal diagnosis. Detection of single-nucleotide variants, copy-number variants and structural rearrangements was performed simultaneously and the results were integrated for interpretation in accordance with the guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants were selected for validation and parental confirmation, when available.\\n\\nResultsOverall, 50 fetuses were enrolled, including 34 cases with isolated increased NT and 16 cases with other fetal structural malformations. Routine CMA and karyotyping reported eight P/LP CNVs, yielding a diagnostic rate of 16.0% (8/50). In comparison, GS provided a 2-fold increase in diagnostic yield (32.0%, 16/50), including one mosaic turner syndrome, eight cases with microdeletions/microduplications and seven cases with P/LP point mutations. Moreover, GS identified two cryptic insertions and two inversions. Follow-up study further demonstrated the potential pathogenicity of an apparently balanced insertion which disrupted an OMIM autosomal dominant disease-causing gene at the inserted site.\\n\\nConclusionsOur study demonstrates that applying GS in fetuses with increased NT can comprehensively detect and delineate the various genomic variants that are causative to the diseases. Importantly, prenatal diagnosis by GS doubled the diagnostic yield compared with routine protocols. Given a comparable turn-around-time and less DNA required, our study provides strong evidence to facilitate GS in prenatal diagnosis, particularly in fetuses with increased NT.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn addition to motor deficits, Parkinsons disease (PD) may cause perceptual impairments. The role of perceptual impairments in sensorimotor function is unclear, and has typically been studied in single-joint motions. Research Question: We hypothesized that perception of whole-body motion is impaired in PD and contributes to balance impairments. We tested 1) whether directional acuity to whole body perturbations during standing was worse in people with PD compared to neurotypical older adults (NOA), and 2) whether balance ability, as assessed by the MiniBESTest, was associated with poor directional acuity in either group.\\n\\nMethodsParticipants were exposed to pairs of support-surface translation perturbations in a two-alternative forced choice testing paradigm developed previously in a young healthy population. The first perturbation of each pair was directly backward and the second deviated to the left or right (1{degrees}-44{degrees}). Participants judged and reported whether the perturbations in each pair were in the \\\"same\\\" or \\\"different\\\" direction. This information was used to calculate directional acuity thresholds corresponding to \\\"just-noticeable differences\\\" in perturbation direction. Linear mixed models determined associations between directional thresholds and clinical variables including MDS UPDRS-III score, age, and MiniBESTest score. Results: 20 PD (64{+/-}7 y, 12 male, [&gt;=]12 hours since last intake of antiparkinsonian medications) and 12 NOA (64{+/-}8, 6 male) were assessed. Directional thresholds were higher (worse) among PD participants (17.6{+/-}5.9{degrees} vs. 12.8{+/-}3.3{degrees}, P<0.01). Linear mixed models further showed that higher thresholds were associated with MDS UPDRS-III score (P<0.01), and were associated with poorer balance ability among PD participants (P<0.01), but not among NOA participants (P=0.40). Significance: Perception of whole-body motion is impaired in PD and may contribute to impaired balance and falls.",

    "abstract": "Asymmetries in motor behavior, such as human hand preference, are observed throughout bilateria. However, neural substrates and developmental signaling pathways that impose underlying functional lateralization on a broadly symmetric nervous system are unknown. Here we report that in the absence of over-riding visual information, zebrafish larvae show intrinsic lateralized motor behavior that is mediated by a cluster of 60 posterior tuberculum (PT) neurons in the forebrain. PT neurons impose motor bias via a projection through the epithalamic commissure to the habenula. Acquisition of left/right identity is disrupted by heterozygous mutations in mosaic eyes and mindbomb, genes that regulate Notch signaling. These results define the neuronal substrate for motor asymmetry in a vertebrate and support the idea that developmental pathways that establish visceral asymmetries also govern acquisition of left/right identity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 cause deficiencies in homologous recombination repair (HR), resulting in repair of DNA double-strand breaks by the alternative non-homologous end-joining pathway, which is more error prone. HR deficiency of breast tumors is important because it is associated with better responses to platinum salt therapies and PARP inhibitors. Among other consequences of HR deficiency are characteristic somatic-mutation signatures and gene-expression patterns. The term \"BRCAness\" describes tumors that harbor an HR defect but have no detectable germline mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. A better understanding of the genes and molecular events associated with BRCAness could provide mechanistic insights and guide development of targeted treatments.\n\nMethodsUsing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for 1101 breast-cancer patients, we identified individuals with a germline mutation, somatic mutation, homozygous deletion, and/or hypermethylation event in BRCA1, BRCA2, and 59 other cancer-predisposition genes. Based on the assumption that BRCAness events would have similar downstream effects on tumor biology as BRCA1/BRCA2 germline mutations, we quantified these effects based on somatic-mutation signatures and gene-expression profiles. We reduced the dimensionality of the somatic-mutation signatures and expression data and used a statistical resampling approach to quantify similarities between patients who had a BRCA1/BRCA2 germline mutation, another type of aberration in BRCA1 or BRCA2, or any type of aberration in one of the other genes.\n\nResultsSomatic-mutation signatures of tumors having a somatic mutation, homozygous deletion, or hypermethylation event in BRCA1/BRCA2 (n = 80) were generally similar to each other and to tumors from BRCA1/BRCA2 germline carriers (n = 44). Additionally, somatic-mutation signatures of tumors with germline or somatic events in ATR (n = 16) and BARD1 (n = 8) showed high similarity to tumors from BRCA1/BRCA2 carriers. Other genes also showed high similarity but only for a small number of events or for a single event type. Tumors with germline mutations or hypermethylation of BRCA1 had relatively similar gene-expression profiles and overlapped considerably with the Basal-like subtype; but the transcriptional effects of the other events lacked consistency.\n\nConclusionsOur findings confirm previously known relationships between molecular signatures and germline or somatic events in BRCA1/BRCA2 and suggest additional genes that may be considered for inclusion in the definition of BRCAness.",

The objective of this study was to investigate the action of the transfection of antibodies against rabies in the central nervous system of mice as target therapy for rabies.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe present study showed that after 48 h of RABV inoculation, mice injected by the intracerebral route with anti-RABV F(ab)2 complexed with Bioporter(R) Protein Delivery Reagent (Genlantis) as a transfection agent, showing a morbidity/mortality rate of 30% with a minimum incubation period of seven days, while in the control group a significantly higher (p<0.0198) 90% morbidity/mortality was reached in thirteen days after a maximum 5-day incubation period, suggesting that the transfection of anti-RABV antibodies into the brain might prevent or delay RABV dissemination in an early stage of rabies infection. For the first time, a single compound was able to inhibit replication of the virus in the nervous system with high efficiency. This result can provide important results for the planning of protocols to prevent the fatal outcome of the disease in advanced stages.

    "abstract": "Ecology requires training in data management and analysis. In this paper, we present data from the last 10 years demonstrating the increase in the use of R, an open-source programming environment, in ecology and its prevalence as a required skill in job descriptions. Because of its transparent and flexible nature, R is increasingly used for data management and analysis in the field of ecology. Consequently, job postings targeting candidates with a bachelors degree and a required knowledge of R have increased over the past ten years. We discuss our experiences teaching undergraduates R in two advanced ecology classes using different approaches. One approach, in a course with a field lab, focused on collecting, cleaning, and preparing data for analysis. The other approach, in a course without a field lab, focused on analyzing existing data sets and applying the results to content discussed in the lecture portion of the course. Our experiences determined that each approach had strengths and weaknesses. We recommend that above all, instructors of ecology and related subjects should be encouraged to include R in their coursework. Furthermore, instructors should be aware of the following: learning R is a separate skill from learning statistics; writing R assignments is a significant time sink for course preparation; and, there is a tradeoff between teaching R and teaching content. Determining how ones course fits into the curriculum and identifying resources outside of the classroom for students continued practice will ensure that R training is successful and will extend beyond a one-semester course.",

    "abstract": "Coronary stents for treating atherosclerosis are traditionally manufactured from metallic alloys. However, metal stents permanently reside in the body and may trigger undesirable immunological responses. Bioresorbable polymer stents can provide a temporary scaffold that resorbs once the artery heals but are mechanically inferior, requiring thicker struts for equivalent radial support, which may increase thrombosis risk. This study addresses the challenge of designing mechanically effective but sufficiently thin poly(L-lactic acid) stents through a computational approach that optimises material properties and stent geometry. Forty parametric stent designs were generated: cross-sectional area (post-dilation), foreshortening, stent-to-artery ratio and radial collapse pressure were evaluated computationally using finite element analysis. Response surface methodology was used to identify performance trade-offs by formulating relationships between design parameters and response variables. Multi-objective optimisation was used to identify suitable stent designs from approximated Pareto fronts and an optimal design is proposed that offers comparable performance to designs in clinical practice. In summary, a computational framework has been developed that has potential application in the design of high stiffness, thin strut polymeric stents that contend with the performance of their metallic counterparts.",

The survey was performed on 148 teats during the dry period, with sample collection in the period D-70 (70 days before delivery) and D14 (14 days after delivery). The milk samples were collected for the Strip Cup Test (SCT), California Mastitis Test (CMT), Microbiological Culture, Somatic Cell Count (SCC), Somatic Cell Score (SCS) and Hyperkeratosis (HK). The groups in which there were no microorganisms grow were divided into two groups, in the first group only the internal sealant in the teat was used (Group 1) and there was another group with the intramammary antibiotic use associated with the internal sealant (Group 2). Teats which were considered positive, with microbiological growth, were treated with the intramammary antibiotic associated with the internal sealant (Group 3). In the comparison of the results of the CMT test between D-70 and D14, a statistical difference was observed in Groups 2 and 3. Group 3, which comprises the positive teats in D-70 presented a reduction of 83.87% and 32.26% in the CMT test between D-70 and D14. Regarding HK, group 1 and 2 had a statistical difference in relation to group 3 in D-70 and D14. As for the numbers of bacteria isolated in D-70 and D14, there was no difference comparing Group 1 and Group 2, unlike Group 3, which had a difference. Group 1 and Group 2 were all negative teats in D-70, showing that the intramammary antibiotic did not influence the outcome of D14. In group 3 there was a reduction of isolates from 62 to 15 in D14. The most prevalent microorganism was Streptococcus agalactiae with 43.37% of the total isolates, followed by Staphylococcus aureus (16.87%) and Corynebacterium spp. (13.25%) and Coagulase negative Staphylococcus (SCN) (10.84%). The selective treatment of teats in dry dairy cows has advantages over Blanket Dry Cow Therapy by reducing the indiscriminate use of antibiotics, avoiding bacterial resistance, ensuring better milk quality and greater food safety. Antibiotics should only be used for teats with subclinical mastitis, with the microbiological culture at the end of lactation performed by fourth individual mammary.",

    "abstract": "Individuals at 80 years of age or above with exceptional memory are considered SuperAgers (SA). A multimodal brain analysis of SA may provide biomarkers of successful cognitive aging. Herein, a molecular (PET-FDG, PET-PIB), functional (fMRI) and structural analysis (MRI) of SA was conducted. Ten SA, ten age-matched older adults (C80) and ten cognitively normal middle-aged adults underwent cognitive testing and neuroimaging examinations. The relationship between cognitive scores and cingulate areas and hippocampus were examined. The SA group showed increased FDG SUVr in the left subgenual Anterior Cingulate Cortex (sACC, p<0.005) as compared to that in the C80 group. Amyloid deposition was similar between SA and C80 in the described regions or overall areas (p>0.05). The SA group also presented decreased connectivity between left sACC and posterior cingulate (p<0.005) as compared to that of C80 group. These results support the key role of ACC in SA, even in the presence of amyloid deposition. It also suggests that sACC can be used as a potential memory biomarker in older adults.\\n\\nAbbreviationsBCa - Bias corrected accelerated: SA - SuperAgers: C50 - Middle-aged controls: C80 - Age-matched controls",

    "abstract": "BackgroundUnlike developed countries; higher socioeconomic status (SES, education, and wealth) is associated with hypertension in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) with limited evidence. We examined the associations between SES and hypertension in Nepal and the extent to which these associations vary by sex and urbanity. The body mass index (BMI) was examined as a secondary outcome and assessed as a potential mediator.\\n\\nMaterials and methodsWe analyzed the latest Nepal Demographic and Health Survey data (N=13,436) collected between June 2016 and January 2017, using a multistage stratified sampling technique. Participants aged 15 years or older from selected households were interviewed with an overall response rate of 97%. Main outcomes were hypertension and normal blood pressure defined by the widely used Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee (JNC 7), and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) 2017.\\n\\nResultsThe prevalence of hypertension was higher in Nepalese men than women. The likelihood of having hypertension was more than double for individuals in the highest versus lowest wealth quintiles [men: OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.60-2.85); women: OR 2.54, 95% CI 2.00- 3.24] and for individuals with the higher education versus no education [men: OR 2.38, 95% CI 1.75-3.23; women: OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.18-2.25]. The associations between SES and hypertension were different by sex and urbanity. These associations were mediated by BMI.\\n\\nConclusionsHigher SES was positively associated with the higher likelihood of having hypertension in Nepal according to both JNC 7 and ACC/AHA 2017 guidelines. These associations were mediated by BMI, which may help to explain broader socioeconomic differentials in CVD and related risk factors, particularly in terms of education and wealth. Our study suggests that the mediating factor of BMI should be tackled to diminish the risk of CVD in people with higher SES in LMICs.",

    "abstract": "We approach the problem of combining top-ranking association statistics or P-values from a new perspective which leads to a remarkably simple and powerful method. Statistical methods, such as the Rank Truncated Product (RTP), have been developed for combining top-ranking associations and this general strategy proved to be useful in applications for detecting combined effects of multiple disease components. To increase power, these methods aggregate signals across top ranking SNPs, while adjusting for their total number assessed in a study. Analytic expressions for combined top statistics or P-values tend to be unwieldy, which complicates interpretation, practical implementation, and hinders further developments. Here, we propose the Augmented Rank Truncation (ART) method that retains main characteristics of the RTP but is substantially simpler to implement. ART leads to an efficient form of the adaptive algorithm, an approach where the number of top ranking SNPs is varied to optimize power. We illustrate our methods by strengthening previously reported associations of {micro}-opioid receptor variants with sensitivity to pain.",

    "abstract": "We present a deep learning-based framework to design and quantify point-of-care sensors. As its proof-of-concept and use-case, we demonstrated a low-cost and rapid paper-based vertical flow assay (VFA) for high sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP) testing, a common medical test used for quantifying the degree of inflammation in patients at risk of cardio-vascular disease (CVD). A machine learning-based sensor design framework was developed for two key tasks: (1) to determine an optimal configuration of immunoreaction spots and conditions, spatially-multiplexed on a paper-based sensing membrane, and (2) to accurately infer the target analyte concentration based on the signals of the optimal VFA configuration. Using a custom-designed mobile-phone based VFA reader, a clinical study was performed with 85 human serum samples to characterize the quantification accuracy around the clinically defined cutoffs for CVD risk stratification. Results from blindly-tested VFAs indicate a competitive coefficient of variation of 11.2% with a linearity of R2 = 0.95; in addition to the success in the high-sensitivity CRP range (i.e., 0-10 mg/L), our results further demonstrate a mitigation of the hook-effect at higher CRP concentrations due to the incorporation of antigen capture spots within the multiplexed sensing membrane of the VFA. This paper-based computational VFA that is powered by deep learning could expand access to CVD health screening, and the presented machine learning-enabled sensing framework can be broadly used to design cost-effective and mobile sensors for various point-of-care diagnostics applications.",

In colorectal cancer (CRC) and other tumour types, a high number of neoantigens is associated with patient response to immune therapies. The molecular processes governing the generation of neoantigens and their turnover in cancer cells are poorly understood. We exploited CRC as a model system to understand how alterations in DNA repair pathways modulate neoantigen profiles over time.\\n\\nMethodsWe performed Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) in CRC cell lines, in vitro and vivo, and in CRC patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) to track longitudinally genomic profiles, clonal evolution, mutational signatures and predicted neoantigens.\\n\\nResultsThe majority of CRC models showed remarkably stable mutational and neoantigen profiles, however those carrying defects in DNA repair genes continuously diversified. Rapidly evolving and evolutionary stable CRCs displayed characteristic genomic signatures, and transcriptional profiles. Downregulation of molecules implicated in antigen presentation occurred selectively in highly mutated and rapidly-evolving CRC.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results indicate that CRC carrying alterations in DNA repair pathways display dynamic neoantigen patterns that fluctuate over time. We define CRC subsets characterized by slow and fast evolvability and link this phenotype to downregulation of antigen-presenting cellular mechanisms.

Developing new therapeutics requires a molecular understanding of adaptation to the brain microenvironment. Here, we combined RNA-sequencing of BCBM development with a reverse genetic screen in Drosophila melanogaster and identified Rab11b, an endosomal recycling protein, as a mediator of metastatic adaptation. We show that disseminated cells up-regulate Rab11b early after arrival in the brain, allowing control of the cell surface proteome through recycling of proteins required for successful interaction with the microenvironment, including integrin {beta}1. Rab11b-mediated control of integrin {beta}1 surface expression allows ligation to the brain ECM, activating mechanotransduction signaling to allow survival and proliferation. We propose a model in which up-regulation of Rab11b allows disseminated cells to recycle needed proteins during metastatic adaptation, without strictly requiring transcription and translation, to allow for metastatic outgrowth.\\n\\nManuscript SummaryRab11b up-regulation in the brain microenvironment promotes recycling of cargo proteins required for breast cancer brain metastasis, including increased surface expression of integrin {beta}1, which allows brain extracellular matrix attachment and mechanotransduction. Inhibition of the mevalonate pathway with statins prevents geranylgeranylation of Rab11b, decreasing cargo recycling, and inhibiting brain metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Almost a half of microRNAs (miRNAs) in mammalian cells are generated from polycistronic primary transcripts encoding more than one miRNA. Mature miRNAs from polycistronic clusters frequently regulate complementary sets of target mRNAs. How the processing of individual miRNAs within the clusters is controlled to give rise to distinct miRNA levels in vivo is not fully understood. Our investigation of SRSF3 (Serine-Arginine Rich Splicing Factor3) regulated noncoding RNAs in pluripotent cells identified miR-17-92 cluster as a key SRSF3 target, SRSF3 binding to the CNNC motif 17-18nt downstream of the miRNA stem loop. Here we show that SRSF3 binding site context, not merely the distance from the stem loop, within primary transcript is a critical determinant of the processing efficiency of distinct miRNAs derived from the miR-17-92 cluster. SRSF3 specifically enhanced the processing of two paralog miRNAs, miR-17 and miR-20a, targeting overlapping mRNAs including the cell cycle inhibitor CDKN1A/p21. Functional analysis demonstrated that SRSF3 inhibits CDKN1A expression and promotes cell cycle and self-renewal through the miRNA processing pathway both in normal pluripotent stem cells and cancer cells. Strikingly, analysis of colorectal cancer tumour-normal pairs demonstrated that the SRSF3-regulated miRNA processing pathway is present in a large proportion of colorectal cancer patients and distinguishes poorly differentiated high-grade tumours. Our research uncovers a critical role of SRSF3 in selective processing of miR-17-92 miRNAs, which mechanistically and functionally links SRSF3 to hallmark features of cancer.",

    "abstract": "Functional Positron Emission Tomography (fPET) provides a method to track molecular dynamics in the human brain. With a radioactively labelled glucose-analogue, [18F]-flurodeoxyglucose (FDG-fPET), it is now possible to index the dynamics of glucose metabolism with temporal resolutions approaching those of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This direct measure of glucose uptake has enormous potential for understanding normal and abnormal brain function, and probing the effects of metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. Further, new advances in hybrid MR-PET hardware makes it possible to capture fluctuations in glucose and blood oxygenation simultaneously using fMRI and FDG-fPET.\\n\\nThe temporal resolution and signal-to-noise of the FDG-fPET images is critically dependent upon the administration of the radioactive tracer. In this work we present two alternative continuous infusion protocols and compare them to a traditional bolus approach. We detail a method for acquiring blood samples, time-locking PET, MRI and experimental stimulus, and administrating the non-traditional tracer delivery. By applying a visual stimulus, we demonstrate cortical maps of the glucose-response to external stimuli on an individual level with a temporal resolution of 16-seconds.\\n\\nSummaryRadiotracer infusion protocols for positron emission tomography (PET) provide improved temporal resolution over bolus administration. Here, we describe radiotracer administration for two protocols, constant infusion and bolus plus infusion protocol. We compare this to the standard bolus administration protocol. Using [18-F] fluorodeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET) as an example, we show that temporal resolutions of approximately 16sec are achievable using these protocols.",

    "abstract": "Humanity is facing a biodiversity crisis, with freshwater-associated biodiversity in a particularly dire state. Novel ecosystems created through human use of mineral resources, such as gravel pit lakes, can provide substitute habitats for conservation of freshwater and riparian biodiversity. However, many of these artificial ecosystems may exhibit high recreational use intensity, which may limit their biodiversity potential.The species richness of several taxa (plants, amphibians, dragonflies, damselflies, waterfowl, songbirds) was assessed and a range of taxonomic biodiversity metrics were compared between gravel pit lakes managed for recreational fisheries (N = 16) and unmanaged reference lakes (N = 10), while controlling for non-fishing related environmental variation.The average species richness of all examined taxa was similar among both lake types and no substantial differences in species composition were revealed when examining the pooled species inventory. Similarly, there were no differences among lake types in the presence of rare species and in the Simpson diversity index across all the taxa that were assessed.Variation in species richness among lakes was correlated with woody habitat, lake morphology (surface area and steepness) and land use, but not correlated with the presence of recreational fisheries. Thus, non-fishing related environmental variables had stronger effects on local species presence than recreational-fisheries management or the presence of recreational anglers.Collectively, no evidence was found that anglers and recreational-fisheries management constrain the development of aquatic and riparian biodiversity in gravel pit lakes in the study region. Conservation of species diversity at gravel pit lakes could benefit from an increasing reliance on habitat enhancement activities.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to establish a robust, reproducible and reliable metaproteomic pipeline for an in-depth characterization of marine particle-associated (PA) bacteria. To this end, we compared six well-established protein extraction protocols together with different MS-sample preparation techniques using particles sampled during a North Sea spring algae bloom in 2009. In this optimized workflow, proteins are extracted using a combination of SDS-containing lysis buffer and cell disruption by bead-beating, separated by SDS-PAGE, in-gel digested and analysed by LC-MS/MS, before MASCOT search against a metagenome-based database and data processing/visualization with the in-house-developed bioinformatics tools Prophane and Paver.\\n\\nAs proof of principle, free-living (FL) and particulate communities sampled in April 2009 were analysed, resulting in an as yet unprecedented number of 9,354 and 5,034 identified protein groups for FL and PA bacteria, respectively. Our data revealed that FL and PA communities appeared similar in their taxonomic distribution, with notable exceptions: eukaryotic proteins and proteins assigned to Flavobacteriia, Cyanobacteria, and some proteobacterial genera were found more abundant on particles, whilst overall proteins belonging to Proteobacteria were more dominant in the FL fraction. In contrast, significant functional differences including proteins involved in polysaccharide degradation, sugar- and phosphorus uptake, adhesion, motility, and stress response were detected.\\n\\nOriginality-Significance StatementMarine particles consist of organic particulate matter (e.g. phyto- or zooplankton) and particle-associated (PA) microbial communities, which are often embedded in a sugary matrix. A significant fraction of the decaying algal biomass in marine ecosystems is expected to be mineralized by PA heterotrophic communities, which are thus greatly contributing to large-scale carbon fluxes. Whilst numerous studies have investigated the succession of planktonic marine bacteria along phytoplankton blooms, the community structure and functionality of PA bacterial communities remained largely unexplored and knowledge on specific contributions of these microorganisms to carbon cycling is still surprisingly limited. This has been mostly been due to technical problems, i.e. to the difficulty to retrieve genomic DNA and proteins from these polysaccharide-rich entities, their enormous complexity and the high abundance of eukaryotic microorganisms.\\n\\nOur study presents an innovative, robust, reproducible, and reliable metaproteomics pipeline for marine particles, which will help to address and fill the above-described knowledge gap. Employing the here established workflow enabled us to identify more than 5,000 PA proteins, which is, at least to our knowledge, the largest number of protein groups ever assigned to marine particles. Notably, the novel pipeline has been validated by a first, comparative metaproteome analysis of free-living and PA bacterial communities indicating a significant functional shift enabling surface-associated bacteria to adapt to particle-specific living conditions. In conclusion, our novel metaproteomics pipeline presents a solid and promising methodological groundwork for future culture-independent analyses of seasonal taxonomic and functional successions of PA microbial communities in aquatic habitats.",

    "abstract": "The isotype-specific composition of the keratin cytoskeleton is important for strong adhesion, force resilience, and barrier function of the epidermis. However, the mechanisms by which keratins regulate these functions are still incompletely understood. In this study, the role and significance of the keratin network for mechanical integrity, force transmission, and barrier formation were analyzed in murine keratinocytes. Following the time-course of single-cell wounding, wildtype (WT) cells slowly closed the gap in a collective fashion involving tightly connected neighboring cells. In contrast, the mechanical response of neighboring cells was compromised in keratin-deficient cells, causing an increased wound area initially and an inefficient overall wound closure. Furthermore, the loss of the keratin network led to impaired, fragmented cell-cell junctions and triggered a profound change in the overall cellular actomyosin architecture. Electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing of cell junctions revealed a dysfunctional barrier in knockout (Kty-/-) compared to WT cells. These findings demonstrate that Kty-/- cells display a novel phenotype characterized by loss of mechanocoupling and failure to form a functional barrier. Re-expression of K5/K14 rescued the barrier defect to a significant extent and reestablished the mechanocoupling with remaining discrepancies likely due to the low abundance of keratins in that setting. Our study reveals the major role of the keratin network for mechanical homeostasis and barrier functionality in keratinocyte layers.",

We now used a genome-wide siRNA screen to molecularly identify the widely expressed acid-sensitive outwardly-rectifying ASOR chloride channel. ASOR is formed by TMEM206 proteins which display two transmembrane domains (TMs) and are expressed at the plasma membrane. Ion permeation-changing mutations along the length of TM2 and at the end of TM1 suggest that these segments line ASORs pore. While not belonging to a gene family, TMEM206 has orthologs in probably all vertebrates. Currents from evolutionarily distant orthologs share activation by protons, a feature essential for ASORs role in acid-induced cell death. TMEM206 defines a novel class of ion channels.

This transition encompasses programmed shutoff of stem/progenitor genes, upregulation of T-cell specification genes, extensive proliferation, and commitment after a delay. We have incorporated these factors, as well as new single cell gene expression and developmental kinetics data, into a three-level dynamic model of commitment based upon regulation of the commitment gene Bcl11b. The first level is a core gene regulatory network architecture determined by transcription factor perturbation data, the second a stochastically controlled epigenetic gate, and the third a proliferation model validated by growth and commitment kinetics measured at single-cell levels. Using expression values consistent with single molecule RNA-FISH measurements of key transcription factors, this single-cell model exhibits state switching consistent with measured population and clonal proliferation and commitment times. The resulting multi-scale model provides a powerful mechanistic framework for dissecting commitment dynamics.",

After termination, RNAP is thought to initiate the next round of transcription by detaching from DNA and rebinding a new promoter. We used single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to observe individual RNAP molecules after transcript release at a terminator. Following termination, RNAP almost always remained bound to DNA and sometimes exhibited one-dimensional sliding over thousands of basepairs. Unexpectedly, the DNA-bound RNAP often restarted transcription, usually in reverse direction, thus producing an antisense transcript. Furthermore, we report evidence of this \\\"secondary initiation\\\" in live cells, using genome-wide RNA sequencing.

    "abstract": "As pollinator decline is increasingly reported in natural and agricultural environments, cities are perceived as shelters for pollinators because of low pesticide exposure and high floral diversity throughout the year. This has led to the development of environmental policies supporting pollinators in urban areas. However, policies are often restricted to the promotion of honey bee colony installations, which resulted in a strong increase in apiary numbers in cities. Recently, competition for floral resources between wild pollinators and honey bees has been highlighted in semi-natural contexts, but whether urban beekeeping could impact wild pollinators remains unknown. Here, we show that in the city of Paris (France), wild pollinator visitation rates is negatively correlated to honey bee colony densities present in the surrounding (500m - slope = -0.614; p = 0.001 - and 1000m - slope = -0.489; p = 0.005). More particularly, large solitary bees and beetles were significantly affected at 500m (respectively slope = -0.425, p = 0.007 and slope = - 0.671, p = 0.002) and bumblebees were significantly affected at 1000m (slope = - 0.451, p = 0.012). Further, lower interaction evenness in plant-pollinator networks was observed with honey bee colony densities within 1000 meter buffers (slope = -0.487, p = 0.008). Finally, honey bees tended to focus their foraging activity on managed rather than spontaneous plant species (student t-test, p = 0.001) whereas wild pollinators equally visited managed and spontaneous species. We advocate responsible practices mitigating the introduction of high density of hives in urban environments. Future studies are needed to deepen our knowledge about the potential negative interactions between wild and domesticated pollinators.",

Despite being extensively studied, how its target genes are selected and whether its histone modifying activities are required for transcriptional repression remains controversial. Here, we directly test the requirement for PRC1 catalytic activity in Polycomb system function. We demonstrate that a mutation widely used to disrupt PRC1 catalysis is hypomorphic, complicating the interpretation of previous studies. To overcome this, we develop a new inducible mutation system in embryonic stem cells that completely ablates PRC1 catalytic activity, revealing that catalysis by PRC1 drives Polycomb chromatin domain formation and higher-order chromatin interactions. In the absence of catalysis, we uncover the primary DNA-based targeting determinants that direct Polycomb target site selection. Finally, we discover that Polycomb-mediated gene repression requires PRC1 catalytic activity. Together these discoveries provide compelling new evidence supporting a PRC1-initiated pathway for Polycomb system function in gene regulation.",

    "abstract": "High mortality is usually observed during the transition from larvae to juvenile in teleost which is related to the transition from endogenous to exogenous feeding. Autophagy is an evolutionary regulated cellular mechanism highly conserved in eukaryotic organisms to maintain energy homeostasis against stress including starvation. To investigate whether autophagy plays a role during the larval-juvenile transition, we generated atg7 and beclin1 zebrafish mutant lines using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. In this study, both atg7 and beclin1 null zebrafish exhibited a normal body confirmation; nevertheless, they completely died around 15 dpf and 9 dpf respectively. During larval-juvenile transition period, atg7 and beclin1 mutants were unable to cope with the metabolic stress after yolk absorption at 5 dpf and fail to activate autophagy in response to nutrient restriction, and without external feeding, all mutants died nearly at 8 dpf. Dramatic defects in the intestine architecture and metabolic functions in the liver were observed even though providing larvae with an external food supply, suggesting that autophagy isnt only important during yolk depletion but also within food plenty. Treatment with rapamycin, an activator of autophagy, could effectively extend the survival time of both atg7 and beclin1 null zebrafish through lowering the metabolic rate while it couldnt activate autophagy in mutants via the canonical pathway. Our findings provided a molecular evidence for the physiological, histological and metabolic changes that occur during the transition process from the larval to the juvenile stages and the chief role of autophagy on the body metabolism during these turning milestones.\\n\\nAuthor summaryZebrafish Danio rerio has emergrd one of the most powerful research models for studying genes expression during early embryogenesis and postnatal development. On the basis of the cell mechanisms, Macroautphagy, a natural regulated pathway disassembles unnecessary or dysfunctional components orchestrated by more than 36 autophagy related-genes conserved from yeast to mammals. Among those genes are atg7 and beclin1 which have been proved to play an important role in regulating post natal development in some mammals however their roles during zebrafish development still unedited. During this research, CRISPER/CAS9 were adopted to know atg7 and beclin1 knockout effects on the mutants metabolism during shifting from maternal yolk acquisition to exogenous feeding and the role of autophagy during the larvae to pre-juvenile development. Herein, we found out that larvae couldnt abandon autophagy in both fasting and feeding conditions as larvae died earlier before pre-juvenile development despite feeding declaring the importance of autophagy not only to provide the cell with essential nutrients during starvation but also to get rid of cargos inside the eukaryotic cells. Briefly, if the larvae didnt recycle those cargos due to autophagy perturbations, they will die despite providing suitable conditions including food and acclimatization.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDeposition of complement factors on Mycobacterium leprae may enhance phagocytosis. Such deposition may occur through the lectin pathway of complement. Three proteins of the lectin pathway are produced from the gene MASP1: Mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease 1 (MASP-1) and MASP-3 and mannan-binding lectin-associated protein of 44 kDa (MAp44). Despite their obvious importance, the roles played by these proteins have never been investigated in leprosy disease.\\n\\nMethodologyWe haplotyped five MASP1 polymorphisms by multiplex sequence-specific PCR (intronic rs7609662*G>A and rs13064994*C>T, exon 12 3-untranslated rs72549262*C>G, rs1109452*C>T and rs850314*G>A) and measured MASP-1, MASP-3 and MAp44 serum levels in 196 leprosy patients (60%, lepromatous) and 193 controls.\\n\\nPrincipal findingsLower MASP-3 and MAp44 levels were observed in patients, compared with controls (P=0.0002 and P<0.0001, respectively) and in lepromatous, compared with non-lepromatous patients (P=0.008 and P=0.002, respectively). Higher MASP-3 levels occurred in controls carrying variants/haplotypes associated with leprosy resistance (rs13064994*T, rs1109452_rs850314*CG within GT_CCG and rs850314*A: OR=0.5-0.6, Pcorr=0.01-0.04).

Those with GC_CCG, presented increasing susceptibility (OR=1.7, Pcorr=0.006) and had higher MAp44 levels (P=0.015). MASP-3 expression decreased in patients, compared with controls carrying rs1109452_rs850314*CA or CG (P[&le;]0.02), which may rely on exon 12 CpG methylation and/or miR-2861/miR-3181 mRNA binding.\\n\\nConclusionPolymorphisms regulating MASP-3/MAp44 availability in serum modulate leprosy susceptibility, underlining the importance of lectin pathway regulation against pathogens that exploit phagocytosis to parasitize host macrophages.\\n\\nAuthor summarySince immemorial times, Mycobacterium leprae inflicts permanent injuries in human kind, within a wide symptomatic spectrum ranging from insensitive skin patches to disabling physical lesions. Innate resistance to this parasite is well recognized, but poorly understood. The complement system is one of the most important arms of the innate response, and several lines of evidence indicate that it may be usurped by the parasite to enhance its entrance into host cells. These include our recent work on genetic association of the disease with lectin pathway components and the complement receptor CR1, whose polymorphisms modulate susceptibility to infection and clinical presentation. Here, we add another pivotal piece in the leprosy parasite-host interaction puzzle: polymorphisms and serum levels of three different lectin pathway proteins, all encoded by the same gene, namely mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease 1 (MASP1). We found lower levels of two of these proteins, MASP-3 and MAp44, in leprosy patients. Higher MASP-3/lower MASP-1 levels were associated with protective haplotypes, containing two side-by-side polymorphisms located in the exclusive untranslated region of MASP-3 exon 12, which may regulate exon splicing and/or translation efficiency. The associations revealed in this study reflect the pleiotropic nature of this gene. They further illustrate the complexity of the response mounted against the parasite, which places MASP1 products in the regulatory crossroad between the innate and adaptive arms of the immunological system, modulating leprosy susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus epidermidis is a Gram-positive saprophytic bacterium found in the microaerobic/anaerobic layers of the skin. It becomes a health hazard when introduced across the skin by punctures or wounds. S. epidermidis forms biofilms in low O2 environments. As oxygen concentrations ([O2]) decreased, the metabolism of S. epidermidis was modified ranging from fully aerobic to anaerobic. Respiratory activity increased at high [O2], while anaerobically grown cells exhibited the highest rate of fermentation. High aerobic metabolism coincided with high hydrogen peroxide-mediated damage. Remarkably, the rate of growth decreased at low [O2] even though the concentration of ATP was high. Under these conditions bacteria associated into biofilms. Then, in the presence of metabolic inhibitors, biofilm formation decreased. It is suggested that when [O2] is low S. epidermidis accumulates ATP in order to synthesize the proteins and polysaccharides needed to attach to surfaces and form biofilms.\\n\\nImportanceBacteria and humans coexist, establishing all kinds of relationships that may change from saprophytic to infectious as environmental conditions vary. S. epidermidis is saprophytic when living in the skin. Inside the organism it evokes a pathologic reaction and is thus rejected by the organism. Additionally it is forced to adapt to high oxygen concentrations, becoming vulnerable to reactive oxygen species, which may come from leukocyte attack. Avoiding both, high oxygen and leukocytes is a must for bacteria. Escaping from oxygen involves a clever response: whenever it finds a low oxygen environment it attaches to surfaces, associating into biofilms. Biofilms protect S. epidermidis against host cells. Understanding these responses is a must in order to develop treatments and prevent infection success.",

    "abstract": "Although molecular self-organization and pattern formation are key features of life, only very few pattern-forming biochemical systems have been identified that can be reconstituted and studied in vitro under defined conditions. A systematic understanding of the underlying mechanisms is often hampered by multiple interactions, conformational flexibility and other complex features of the pattern forming proteins. Because of its compositional simplicity of only two proteins and a membrane, the MinDE system from Escherichia coli has in the past years been invaluable for deciphering the mechanisms of spatiotemporal self-organization in cells. Here we explored the potential of reducing the complexity of this system even further, by identifying key functional motifs in the effector MinE that could be used to design pattern formation from scratch. In a combined approach of experiment and quantitative modeling, we show that starting from a minimal MinE-MinD interaction motif, pattern formation can be obtained by adding either dimerization or membrane-binding motifs. Moreover, we show that the pathways underlying pattern formation are recruitment-driven cytosolic cycling of MinE and recombination of membrane-bound MinE, and that these differ in their in vivo phenomenology.",

Here we bypassed this hurdle by generating a 2D agent-based model of a proliferating PSE and compared its output to the growth of the chick neuroepithelium to assess the interplay between INM and these other important cell processes during growth of a PSE. We found that INM directly generates apical expansion and apical nuclear crowding. In addition, our data strongly suggest that apicobasal elongation of cells is not an emerging property of a proliferative PSE but rather requires a specific elongation program. We then discuss how such program might functionally link INM, tissue growth and differentiation.\\n\\nAuthors SummaryPseudostratified epithelia (PSE) are a common type of epithelia characterized by the choreographed displacement of cells nuclei along the apicobasal axis during proliferation.

    "abstract": "HIV-1 gene expression is regulated by host and viral factors that interact with viral motifs and is influenced by proviral integration sites. Here, expression variation among integrants was followed for hundreds of individual proviral clones within polyclonal populations throughout successive rounds of virus and cultured cell replication. Initial findings in immortalized cells were validated using CD4+ cells from donor blood. Tracking clonal behavior by proviral \\\"zip codes\\\" indicated that mutational inactivation during reverse transcription was rare, while clonal expansion and proviral expression states varied widely. By sorting for provirus expression using a GFP reporter in the nef open reading frame, distinct clone-specific variation in on/off proportions were observed that spanned three orders of magnitude. Tracking GFP phenotypes over time revealed that as cells divided, their progeny alternated between HIV transcriptional activity and non-activity. Despite these phenotypic oscillations, the overall GFP+ population within each clone was remarkably stable, with clones maintaining clone-specific equilibrium mixtures of GFP+ and GFP-cells. Integration sites were analyzed for correlations between genomic features and the epigenetic phenomena described here. Integrants inserted in genes sense orientation were more frequently found to be GFP negative than those in the antisense orientation, and clones with high GFP+ proportions were more distal to repressive H3K9me3 peaks than low GFP+ clones. Clones with low frequencies of GFP positivity appeared to expand more rapidly than clones for which most cells were GFP+, even though the tested proviruses were Vpr-. Thus, much of the increase in the GFP-population in these polyclonal pools over time reflected differential clonal expansion. Together, these results underscore the temporal and quantitative variability in HIV-1 gene expression among proviral clones that are conferred in the absence of metabolic or cell-type dependent variability, and shed light on cell-intrinsic layers of regulation that affect HIV-1 population dynamics.\\n\\nSummaryVery few HIV-1 infected cells persist in patients for more than a couple days, but those that do pose life-long health risks. Strategies designed to eliminate these cells have been based on assumptions about what viral properties allow infected cell survival. However, such approaches for HIV-1 eradication have not yet shown therapeutic promise, possibly because much of the research underlying assumptions about virus persistence has been focused on a limited number of infected cell types, the averaged behavior of cells in diverse populations, or snapshot views. Here, we developed a high-throughput approach to study hundreds of distinct HIV-1 infected cells and their progeny over time in an unbiased way. This revealed that each virus established its own pattern of gene expression that, upon infected cell division, was stably transmitted to all progeny cells. Expression patterns consisted of alternating waves of activity and inactivity, with the extent of activity differing among infected cell families over a 1000-fold range. The dynamics and variability among infected cells and within complex populations that the work here revealed has not previously been evident, and may help establish more accurate correlates of persistent HIV-1 infection.",

    "abstract": "Nutritional stress, and especially a dearth of pollen, is considered an important factor associated with honey bee colony losses. We used pollen-restricted colonies as a model to study the nutritional stress conditions experienced in colonies within intensively cultivated agricultural areas. This model was complemented by the establishment of an experimental design, which allowed us to uncouple the effect of nutrition, behavior and age in colonies of similar size and demography. We used this system to determine the effect of pollen restriction on workers behavioral development. Then, we analyzed the effect of nutritional stress, behavior and age on the expression of key physiological genes involved in the regulation of division of labor. Finally, we analyzed the effects of these variables on the expression of immune genes and the titers of honey bee viruses. Our results show that pollen restriction led to an increased number of precocious foragers and this behavioral transition was associated with important changes in the expression of nutritionally regulated physiological genes, immunity and viral titers. Vitellogenin (vg) and major royal jelly protein 1 (mrjp1) were the most predictive markers of nutrition and behavior. The expression of immune genes was primarily affected by behavior, with higher levels in foragers. Deformed wing virus (DWV) titers were significantly affected by behavior and nutritional status, with higher titer in foragers and increased levels associated with pollen ingestion. Correlation analyses support the predominant effect of behavior on immunity and susceptibility to viral infection, revealing that both immune genes and DWV exhibited strong negative correlations with genes associated with nursing, but positive correlations with genes associated with foraging. Our results provide valuable insights into the physiological mechanisms by which nutritional stress induce precocious foraging and increased susceptibility to viral infections.",

In this prospective cohort study, a set of inflammatory mediators was quantified in blood and pleural fluid (PF) from exudative pleural effusion cases, including PlTB (n = 22) and non-PlTB (NTB; n= 17) patients. The levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, IFN-{gamma}, TNF, IP-10, TGF-{beta}1, and ADA were measured and a principal component analysis was applied in order to identify the mediators who contributed most for the variance in data. IFN-{gamma}, IP-10, TNF, TGF-{beta}, and ADA quantified in PF showed significantly higher concentrations in PlTB patients when compared to NTB ones. When blood and PF were compared, we have identified significantly higher concentrations of IL-6 and IL-10 in PF, in both groups. TGF-{beta}, solely, showed significantly increased levels in PF and blood from PlTB when both clinical specimens were compared to NTB patients. Principal components analysis from PF revealed that the ADA, IP-10, TGF-{beta}, and IFN-{gamma} contributed most for the discriminatory capacity between TPlB and NTB. Our findings showed that important inflammatory mediators in PF may discriminate TB cases from other causes of exudative effusion, the main diseases considered in the differential diagnosis of PlTB.",

    "abstract": "To achieve long-term viral remission in HIV-infected children, novel strategies beyond early anti-retroviral therapy (ART) will be necessary. Identifying clinical predictors of time to viral rebound upon ART interruption will streamline the development of novel therapeutic strategies and accelerate their evaluation in clinical trials. However, identification of these biomarkers is logistically challenging in infants, due to sampling limitations and potential risks of treatment interruption. To facilitate identification of biomarkers predicting viral rebound, we have developed an infant rhesus macaque (RM) model of oral SHIV.CH505.375H.dCT challenge and analytical treatment interruption (ATI) after short-term ART. We used this model to characterize SHIV replication kinetics and virus-specific immune responses during short-term ART or post-ATI and demonstrated plasma viral rebound in 5 out of 6 (83%) infants. We observed a decline in humoral immune responses and partial dampening of systemic immune activation upon initiation of ART in these infants. Furthermore, we documented that infant and adult macaques have similar SHIV replication and rebound kinetics and equally potent virus-specific humoral immune responses. Finally, we validated our models by confirming a well-established correlate of time to viral rebound, namely pre-ART plasma viral load, as well as identified additional potential humoral immune correlates. Thus, this model of infant ART and viral rebound can be used and further optimized to define biomarkers of viral rebound following long-term ART as well as to pre-clinically assess novel therapies to achieve a pediatric HIV functional cure.\\n\\nIMPORTANCENovel interventions that do not rely on daily adherence to ART are needed to achieve sustained viral remission for perinatally infected children who currently rely on lifelong ART. Considering the risks and expense associated with ART-interruption trials, identification of biomarkers of viral rebound will prioritize promising therapeutic intervention strategies, including anti-HIV Env protein therapeutics. However, comprehensive studies to identify those biomarkers are logistically challenging in human infants, demanding the need for relevant non-human primate models of HIV rebound. In this study, we developed an infant RM model of oral Simian/Human Immunodeficiency virus infection expressing clade C HIV Env, and short-term ART followed by ATI, longitudinally characterizing immune responses to viral infection during ART and post-ATI. Additionally, we compared this infant RM model to an analogous adult RM rebound model and identified virologic and immunologic correlates of time to viral rebound post-ATI.",

Despite its central role in regulating cellular behavior, the biogenesis of the primary cilium is not fully understood. In fact, the source of the ciliary membrane remains a mystery in cell types that assemble their primary cilium entirely at the cell surface, such as polarized renal epithelial cells. After cytokinesis, the remnant of the midbody of these cells moves to the center of the apical surface, where it licenses the centrosome for ciliogenesis through an unidentified mechanism. Here, to investigate the origin of the ciliary membrane and the role of the midbody remnant, we analyzed membrane compaction and lipid dynamics at the microscale and nanoscale in living renal epithelial MDCK cells. We found that a specialized patch made of condensed membranes with restricted lipid lateral mobility surrounds the midbody remnant. This patch accompanies the remnant on its journey towards the centrosome and, once the two structures have met, the remnant delivers part of membranes of the patch to build the ciliary membrane. In this way, we have determined the origin of the ciliary membrane and the contribution of the midbody remnant to primary cilium formation in cells whose primary cilium is assembled at the plasma membrane.",

    "abstract": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects and activates resting human B-lymphocytes, reprograms them, induces their proliferation, and establishes a latent infection in them. In established EBV-infected cell lines many viral latent genes are expressed. Their roles in supporting the continuous proliferation of EBV-infected B cells in vitro are known, but their functions in the early, pre-latent phase of infection have not been investigated systematically. In studies during the first eight days of infection using derivatives of EBV with mutations in single genes of EBVs we found only EBNA2 to be essential for activating naive human B-lymphocytes, inducing their growth in cell volume, driving them into rapid cell divisions, and preventing cell death in a subset of infected cells. EBNA-LP, LMP2A and the viral microRNAs have supportive, auxiliary functions, but mutants of LMP1, EBNA3A, EBNA3C, and the noncoding EBER RNAs had no discernable phenotype compared with wild-type EBV. B cells infected with a double mutant of EBNA3A and 3C had an unexpected proliferative advantage and did not regulate the DNA damage response (DDR) of the infected host cell in the pre-latent phase. Even EBNA1 which has very critical long-term functions in maintaining and replicating the viral genomic DNA in established cell lines, was dispensable for the early activation of infected cells. Our findings document that the virus dose is a critical parameter and indicate that EBNA2 governs the infected cells initially and implements a strictly controlled temporal program independent of other viral latent genes. It thus appears that EBNA2 is sufficient to control all requirements for clonal cellular expansion and to reprogram human B-lymphocytes from energetically quiescent to activated cells.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe preferred target of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are human resting B-lymphocytes. We found that their infection induces a well-coordinated, time-driven program that starts with a substantial increase in cell volume followed by cellular DNA synthesis after three days and subsequent rapid rounds of cell divisions on the next day accompanied by some DNA replication stress (DRS). Two to three days later the cells decelerate and turn into stably proliferating lymphoblast cell lines. With the aid of 16 different recombinant EBV strains we investigated the individual contributions of EBVs multiple latent genes during early B-cell infection and found that many do not exert a detectable phenotype or contribute little to EBVs pre-latent phase. The exception is EBNA2 that is essential in governing all aspects of B-cell reprogramming. EBV relies on EBNA2 to turn the infected B-lymphocytes into proliferating lymphoblasts preparing the infected host cell for the ensuing stable, latent phase of viral infection. In the early steps of B-cell reprogramming viral latent genes other than EBNA2 are dispensable but some, EBNA-LP for example, support the viral program and presumably stabilize the infected cells once viral latency is established.",

    "abstract": "Tumour suppressor genes are frequently affected by somatic alterations in cancer, and the impairment of their normal function provides a strong contribution to tumourigenesis. Short-hairpin (sh) RNA library screens have been employed as powerful genetic tools to uncover important new players in human cancer 1-5. To identify potential novel tumour suppressor genes acting in the p53 pathway, we performed an shRNA screen using a cell-based model in which only a single additional genetic event disrupting the p53 pathway is required to obtain in vitro transformation. By using this approach, we report here on the identification of the Frizzled-ligand Norrin (Norrie disease protein) as a candidate tumour suppressor. Inhibition of Norrin expression promotes anchorage-independent growth, confers a strong growth advantage to cells and causes a reduction in p53 protein levels. Conversely, recombinant human Norrin increases p53 levels in a {beta}-catenin dependent fashion. Interestingly, Norrin expression is stimulated by oncogenic H-RAS and BRAF, suggesting that Norrin is part of an early fail-safe mechanism to suppress transformation, and that mutation or down regulation of Norrin could contribute to tumour progression. Indeed, we found that Norrin expression is significantly decreased in melanoma, breast, prostate and ovarian cancer. These findings support the existence of a novel autocrine/paracrine feedback loop that constrains tumourigenesis, in which the crosstalk between the RAS and {beta}-catenin pathways play an unanticipated role.",

    "abstract": "During neural development, stem and precursor cells can divide either symmetrically or asymmetrically. The transition between symmetric and asymmetric cell divisions is a major determinant of precursor cell expansion and neural differentiation, but the underlying mechanisms that regulate this transition are not well understood. Here, we identify the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway as a critical determinant regulating the mode of division of cerebellar granule cell precursors (GCPs). Using partial gain and loss of function mutations within the Shh pathway, we show that pathway activation determines spindle orientation of GCPs, and that mitotic spindle orientation directly correlates with the mode of division. Mechanistically, we show that the phosphatase Eya1 is essential for implementing Shh-dependent GCP spindle orientation. We identify atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) as a direct target of Eya1 activity and show that Eya1 dephosphorylates Threonine (T410) in the activation loop of this polarity complex component. Thus, Eya1 inactivates the cell polarity complex, resulting in reduced phosphorylation of Numb and other components that regulate the mode of division. This Eya1-dependent cascade is critical in linking spindle orientation, cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation. Together these findings demonstrate that a Shh-Eya1 regulatory axis selectively promotes symmetric cell divisions during cerebellar development by coordinating spindle orientation and cell fate determinants.\\n\\nSummary statementBiological responses to Shh signaling are specified by the magnitude of pathway activation and the cellular context. This study shows that potent Shh signaling regulates mitotic orientation and symmetric division of cerebellar granule cell precursors in a process that requires the phosphatase Eya1 and unequal distribution of cell fate determinants to daughter cells.",

However, little work has been done regarding their integration to multi-level regulated circuits. In this work, we combined a variety of small transcriptional activator RNAs (STARs) and toehold switches to build highly effective AND-gates. To characterise the components and their dynamic range, we used an Escherichia coli (E. coli) cell-free transcription-translation (TX-TL) system dispensed via nanoliter droplets. We analysed a prototype gate in vitro as well as in silico, employing parameterised ordinary differential equations (ODEs), where parameters were inferred via parallel tempering, a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Based on this analysis, we created nine additional AND-gates and tested them in vitro. The functionality of the gates was found to be highly dependent on the concentration of the activating RNA for either the STAR or the toehold switch. All gates were successfully implemented in vivo, offering a dynamic range comparable to the level of protein circuits. This study shows the potential of a rapid prototyping approach for RNA circuit design, using cell-free systems in combination with a model prediction.\\n\\nAbbreviationsTX-TL (transcription-translation), ODEs (ordinary differential equations), STARs (small transcriptional activator RNAs), MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo).",

    "abstract": "Many long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate gene transcription through binding to histone modification complexes. Therefore, a comprehensive study of nuclear RNAs in a histone modification-specific manner is critical to understand their regulatory mechanisms. Here we develop a method named Profiling Interacting RNAs on Chromatin by deep sequencing (PIRCh-seq), in which we profile chromatin-associated transcriptome in 5 different cell types using antibodies recognizing histone H3 and 6 distinct histone modifications associated with active or repressive chromatin states. PIRCh-seq identified chromatin-associated RNAs with substantially less contamination by nascent transcripts, as compared to existing methods. We classified chromatin-enriched lncRNAs into 6 functional groups based on the patterns of their association with specific histone modifications. LncRNAs were enriched with different chromatin modifications in different cell types, suggesting lncRNAs regulation may also be cell type-specific. By integrating profiles of RNA secondary structure and RNA m6A modification, we found that RNA bases which bind to chromatin tend to be more single stranded. We discovered hundreds of allele-specific RNA-chromatin interactions, nominating specific single nucleotide variants that alter RNA association with chromatin. These results provide a unique resource to globally study the functions of chromatin-associated lncRNAs and elucidate the basic mechanisms of chromatin-RNA interaction.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) are an almost universal constituent of eukaryotic genomes. In animals, Piwi-interacting small RNAs (piRNAs) and repressive chromatin often play crucial roles in preventing TE transcription and thus restricting TE activity. Nevertheless, TE content varies widely across eukaryotes and the dynamics of TE activity and TE silencing across evolutionary time is poorly understood. Here we used experimentally evolved populations of C. elegans to study the dynamics of TE expression over 400 generations. The experimental populations were evolved at three different population sizes to manipulate the efficiency of natural selection versus genetic drift. We demonstrate increased TE expression relative to the ancestral population, with the largest increases occurring in the smallest populations. We show that the transcriptional activation of TEs within active regions of the genome is associated with failure of piRNA-mediated silencing, whilst desilenced TEs in repressed chromatin domains retain small RNAs. Additionally, we find that the sequence context of the surrounding region influences the propensity of TEs to lose silencing through failure of small RNA-mediated silencing. Together, our results show that natural selection in C. elegans is responsible for maintaining low levels of TE expression, and provide new insights into the epigenomic features responsible.",

    "abstract": "The Atlantic herring is a model species for exploring the genetic basis for ecological adaptation, due to its huge population size and extremely low genetic differentiation at selectively neutral loci. However, such studies have so far been hampered because of a highly fragmented genome assembly. Here, we deliver a chromosome-level genome assembly based on a hybrid approach combining a de novo PacBio assembly with Hi-C-supported scaffolding. The assembly comprises 26 autosomes with sizes ranging from 12.4 to 33.1 Mb and a total size, in chromosomes, of 726 Mb. The development of a high-resolution linkage map confirmed the global chromosome organization and the linear order of genomic segments along the chromosomes. A comparison between the herring genome assembly with other high-quality assemblies from bony fishes revealed few interchromosomal but frequent intrachromosomal rearrangements. The improved assembly makes the analysis of previously intractable large-scale structural variation more feasible; allowing, for example, the detection of a 7.8 Mb inversion on chromosome 12 underlying ecological adaptation. This supergene shows strong genetic differentiation between populations from the northern and southern parts of the species distribution. The chromosome-based assembly also markedly improves the interpretation of previously detected signals of selection, allowing us to reveal hundreds of independent loci associated with ecological adaptation in the Atlantic herring.",

Age, race, family history, preoperative prostate-specific antigen, biochemical recurrence and pathological variables using whole mount radical prostatectomy tissue were collected. 313 tumor nodules from 151 men including 68 (45%) Caucasians and 61 (40%) African Americans. Positive family history of prostate cancer was observed in 65 (43%) patients. Preoperative prostate-specific antigen ranged from 0.3 to 52.7 ng/ml (mean 7.04).

    "abstract": "ObjectivesPPAR genes are known as the important regulators of fatty acid oxidation and energy homeostasis. PPAR is highly expressed in the embryonic and adult heart. Previous studies from infant mouse hearts have suggested that activation of PPAR using GW7647 treatment or cardiac-restricted activation of PPAR using MHC-PPAR transgenic mice enhanced fatty acid {beta}-oxidation and promoted cardiomyocyte proliferation rate in the postnatal day 4 mouse heart. Here, we further investigate the impact of PPAR-mediated fatty acid {beta}-oxidation on cardiomyocyte proliferation in the adult mouse heart.\\n\\nMethods and ResultsAdult wild-type (C57BL/6J) mice were subjected to five injections of GW7647, a highly specific PPAR agonist, or vehicle (saline). Cardiomyocyte proliferation was analyzed by quantification of DNA synthesis via ethynyldeoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation and quantification of cells undergoing mitosis using phosphorylated histone H3 (PH3). GW7647 treatment resulted in activation of PPAR target genes associated with fatty acid metabolism and {beta}-oxidation, validating its biological activity. However, GW7647 treatment did not active cardiomyocyte proliferation in the normal heart. In parallel, mice were subjected to myocardial infarction (MI) using permanent coronary artery occlusion. Both GW7647-treatd wild-type mice and MHC-PPAR transgenic mice showed no significant differences in cardiomyocyte DNA synthesis and mitosis compared with vehicle-treated wild-type mice after MI. Furthermore, inhibition of PPAR-mediated fatty acid {beta}-oxidation using etomoxir (ETO) treatment had no impact on cardiomyocyte proliferation in both normal and infarcted hearts of wild-type mice compared with vehicle treatment.\\n\\nSummaryThese findings suggest that activation or inhibition of PPAR-mediated fatty acid {beta}-oxidation did not active cardiomyocyte proliferation in normal or infarcted hearts of adult mice. Any effects on cardiac function observed following PPAR activation treatment is independent of enhanced cardiomyocyte renewal in the adult heart.",

This allowed us to find mechanisms for achieving stability in multiple connected networks with biologically realistic dynamics, including synaptic plasticity and time-varying inputs. These mechanisms included anti-Hebbian plasticity, synaptic sparsity and excitatory-inhibitory balance. We leveraged these findings to construct networks that could perform functionally relevant computations in the presence of noise and disturbance.

    "abstract": "While CANTOS established the role of treating inflammation in atherosclerosis, our understanding of endothelial activation at atherosclerosis-prone sites remains limited. Disturbed flow at atheroprone regions primes plaque inflammation by enhancing endothelial NF-{kappa}B signaling. Herein, we demonstrate a novel role for the Nck adaptor proteins in disturbed flow-induced endothelial activation. Although highly similar, only Nck1 deletion, but not Nck2 deletion, limits flow-induced NF-{kappa}B activation and proinflammatory gene expression. Nck1 knockout mice show reduced endothelial activation and inflammation in both models of disturbed flow and high fat diet-induced atherosclerosis. Bone marrow chimeras confirm that vascular Nck1, but not hematopoietic Nck1, mediates this effect. In contrast, endothelial Nck2 depletion does not affect endothelial activation or atherosclerosis. Domain swap experiments and point mutations identify the Nck1 SH2 domain and the first SH3 domain as critical for flow-induced endothelial activation. We further characterize Nck1s proinflammatory role by identifying interleukin-1 type I receptor kinase-1 (IRAK-1) as a Nck1-selective binding partner, demonstrating IRAK-1 activation by disturbed flow requires Nck1 in vitro and in vivo, showing endothelial Nck1 and IRAK-1 staining in early human atherosclerosis, and demonstrating that disturbed flow-induced endothelial activation requires IRAK-1. Taken together, our data reveal a hitherto unknown link between Nck1 and IRAK-1 in atherogenic inflammation.",
