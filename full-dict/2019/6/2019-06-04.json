    "abstract": "The Parieto-Frontal Integration Theory (PFIT) identified a fronto-parietal network of regions where individual differences in brain parameters most strongly relate to cognitive performance. PFIT was supported and extended in adult samples, but not in youths or within single-scanner well-powered multimodal studies. We performed multimodal neuroimaging in 1601 youths age 8-22 on the same 3-Tesla scanner with contemporaneous neurocognitive assessment, measuring volume, gray matter density (GMD), mean diffusivity (MD), cerebral blood flow (CBF), resting-state functional MRI measures of amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo), and activation to a working memory and a social cognition task. Across age and sex groups, better performance was associated with higher volumes, greater GMD, lower MD, lower CBF, higher ALFF and ReHo and greater activation for the working memory task in PFIT regions. However, additional cortical, striatal, limbic and cerebellar regions showed comparable effects, hence PFIT needs expansion into an Extended PFIT (ExtPFIT) network incorporating nodes that support motivation and affect. Associations of brain parameters became stronger with advancing age group from childhood to adolescence to young adulthood, effects occurring earlier in females. This ExtPFIT network is developmentally fine-tuned, optimizing abundance and integrity of neural tissue while maintaining low resting energy state.",

    "abstract": "Wound healing is a complicated biological process consisting of many types of cellular dynamics and functions regulated by chemical and molecular signals. Recent advances in synthetic biology have made it possible to predictably design and build closed-loop controllers that can function appropriately alongside biological species. In this paper we develop a simple dynamical population model mimicking the sequential relay-like dynamics of cellular populations involved in the wound healing process. Our model consists of four nodes and five signals whose parameters we can tune to simulate various chronic healing conditions. We also develop a set of regulator functions based on type-1 incoherent feed forward loops (IFFL) that can sense the change from acute healing to incomplete chronic wounds, improving the system in a timely manner. Both the wound healing and type-1 IFFL controller architectures are compatible with available synthetic biology experimental tools for potential applications.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

Due to this stability and flexibility, we surmise that deep learning will become an algorithmic mainstay for cell deconvolution of various data types.

    "abstract": "Inspired by the patterns of multicellularity in choanoflagellates, the closest living relatives of animals, we quantify the biophysical processes underlying the morphogenesis of rosette colonies in the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta. We find that rosettes reproducibly transition from an early stage of 2D growth to a later stage of 3D growth, despite the underlying stochasticity of the cell lineages. We postulate that the extracellular matrix (ECM) exerts a physical constraint on the packing of proliferating cells, thereby sculpting rosette morphogenesis. Our perturbative experiments coupled with biophysical simulations demonstrates the fundamental importance of a basally-secreted ECM for rosette morphogenesis. In addition, this yields a morphospace for the shapes of these multicellular colonies, consistent with observations of a range of choanoflagellates. Overall, our biophysical perspective on rosette development complements previous genetic perspectives and thus helps illuminate the interplay between cell biology and physics in regulating morphogenesis.\\n\\nSignificance statementComparisons among animals and their closest living relatives, the choanoflagellates, have begun to shed light on the origin of animal multicellularity and development. Here we complement previous genetic perspectives on this process by focusing on the biophysical principles underlying colony morphology and morphogenesis. Our study reveals the crucial role of the extracellular matrix in shaping the colonies and leads to a phase diagram that delineates the range of morphologies as a function of the biophysical mechanisms at play.",

    "abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-associated cell death is prevalent in various liver diseases. However, the determinant mechanism how hepatocytes survive unresolved stress was still unclear. Interleukin-24 (IL-24) was previously found to promote ER stress-mediated cell death, and yet its expression and function in the liver remained elusive. Here we identified an anti-apoptotic role of IL-24, which transiently accumulated within ER-stressed hepatocytes in a X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1)-dependent manner. Disruption of IL-24 increased cell death in the CCL4- or APAP-challenged mouse liver or Tm-treated hepatocytes. In contrast, pharmaceutical blockade of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) or genetical ablation of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) restored hepatocyte function in the absence of IL-24. In a clinical setting, patients with acute liver failure manifested a profound decrease of hepatic IL-24 expression, which was associated with disease progression. In conclusion, intrinsic hepatocyte IL-24 maintains ER homeostasis by restricting the eIF2-CHOP pathway-mediated stress signal, which might be exploited as a bio-index for prognosis or therapeutic intervention in patients with liver injury.",

    "abstract": "Filamentous fungi are ubiquitous in nature and serve as important biological models in various scientific fields including genetics, cell biology, ecology, evolution, and chemistry. A significant obstacle in studying filamentous fungi is the lack of tools for characterizing their growth and morphology in an efficient and quantitative manner. Consequently, assessments of the growth of filamentous fungi are often subjective and imprecise. In order to remedy this problem, we developed Fungal Feature Tracker (FFT), a user-friendly software comprised of different image analysis tools to automatically quantify different fungal characteristics, such as spore number, spore morphology, and measurements of total length, number of hyphal tips and the area covered by the mycelium. In addition, FFT can recognize and quantify specialized structures such as the traps generated by nematode-trapping fungi, which could be tuned to quantify other distinctive fungal structures in different fungi. We present a detailed characterization and comparison of a few fungal species as a case study to demonstrate the capabilities and potential of our software. Using FFT, we were able to quantify various features at strain and species level, such as mycelial growth over time and the length and width of spores, which would be difficult to track using classical approaches. In summary, FFT is a powerful tool that enables quantitative measurements of fungal features and growth, allowing objective and precise characterization of fungal phenotypes.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryOne of the main obstacles to study filamentous fungi is the lack of tools for characterizing fungal phenotypes in an efficient and quantitative manner. Assessment of cell growth and numbers rely on tedious manual techniques that often result in subjective and imprecise measurements. In response to those limitations, we developed Fungal Feature Tracker (FFT), a user-friendly software that allows researchers to characterize different phenotypic features of filamentous fungi such as sporulation, spore morphology and mycelial growth. In addition, FFT can recognize and quantify other fungal structures including the fungal traps developed by nematode-trapping fungi. In order to show the capabilities and potential of our software, we conducted a detailed characterization and comparison of different fungal species. Our comparison relies on a series of experimental set-ups using standard and easily accessible equipment to ensure reproducibility in other laboratories. In summary, FFT is an easy to use and powerful tool that can quantitatively characterize fungal morphology, cell number and quantitatively measures the filamentous growth, which will allow advance our understanding of the growth and biology of filamentous fungi.",

    "abstract": "Colon cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States. Recent reports have shown that the location of the primary tumor is of clinical importance. Patients with right-sided cancers (RCCs) (tumors arising between the cecum and proximal transverse colon) have poorer clinical outcomes than those with left-sided colon cancers (LCCs) (tumors arising between the distal transverse colon and sigmoid colon, excluding the rectum). Interestingly, women have a lower incidence of colon cancer than men do. However, women have a higher propensity for RCC than men. Identification of gene expression differences between RCC and LCC is considered a potential means of prognostication. Furthermore, studying colon cancer sidedness could reveal important predictive markers for response to various treatments. This study provides a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of various genes and molecular pathways that correlated with sex and anatomical location of colon cancer using four publicly available annotated datasets housed in the National Center for Biotechnology Informations Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We identified differentially expressed genes in tumor tissues from women with RCC, which showed attenuated energy and nutrient metabolism when compared to women with LCC. Specifically, we showed that the downregulation of 5 AMP-activated protein kinase alpha subunit (AMPK) and downregulated anti-tumor immune response in women with RCC. This difference was not seen when comparing tumor tissues from men with RCC to men with LCC. Therefore, women with RCC may have a specific metabolic and immune phenotype which accounts for differences in prognosis and treatment response.",

However, the complex interaction of meteorological factors driving the temporal trends of leptospirosis remain incompletely understood.\\n\\nMethods and findingsFrom 1996 to 2010, we investigated the association between the weekly incidence of leptospirosis and climatic variables in the city of Salvador, Brazil by using a dynamic generalized linear model that accounted for time lags, overall trend and seasonal variation. Our model showed an increase of leptospirosis cases associated with rainfall, lower temperature and higher humidity. There was a lag of one-to-two weeks between weekly values for significant meteorological variables and leptospirosis incidence. Independent of the season, a weekly cumulative rainfall of 20 mm increased the risk of the leptospirosis by 10% compared to a week without rain. Finally, over the 14 year study period the incidence of leptospirosis decreased significantly by four fold (12.8 versus 3.6 per 100,000 people), independently of variations in climate.\\n\\nConclusionsStrategies to control leptospirosis should focus on avoiding contact with contaminated sources of Leptospira as well as on increasing awareness in the population and health professionals within the short time window after both low-level and extreme rainfall events. Increased leptospirosis incidence was restricted to one-to-two weeks after those events suggesting that infectious Leptospira survival may be limited to short time intervals.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryTo determine the role of meteorological variables, seasonal variation and temporal trends in the incidence of leptospirosis, we investigated the time series of leptospirosis incidence amongst residents of Salvador, Brazil, from 1996 to 2010.

Results showed the importance of extreme meteorological conditions, particularly rainfall, as short-term predictors of leptospirosis incidence.

    "abstract": "Colletotrichum is among the most important genera of fungal plant pathogens. Molecular phylogenetic studies over the last decade have resulted in a much better understanding of the evolutionary relationships and species boundaries within the genus. There are now approximately 200 species accepted, most of which are distributed among 13 species complexes. Given their prominence on agricultural crops around the world, rapid identification of a large collection of Colletotrichum isolates is routinely needed by plant pathologists, regulatory officials, and fungal biologists. However, there is no agreement on the best molecular markers to discriminate species in each species complex. Here we calculate the barcode gap distance and intra/inter-specific distance overlap to evaluate each of the most commonly applied molecular markers for their utility as a barcode for species identification. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), histone-3 (HIS3), DNA lyase (APN2), intergenic spacer between DNA lyase and the mating-type locus MAT1-2-1 (APN2/MAT-IGS), and intergenic spacer between GAPDH and a hypothetical protein (GAP2-IGS) have the properties of good barcodes, whereas sequences of actin (ACT), chitin synthase (CHS-1) and nuclear rDNA internal transcribed spacers (nrITS) are not able to distinguish most species. Finally, we assessed the utility of these markers for phylogenetic studies using phylogenetic informativeness profiling, the genealogical sorting index (GSI), and Bayesian concordance analyses (BCA). Although GAPDH, HIS3 and {beta}-tubulin (TUB2) were frequently among the best markers, there was not a single set of markers that were best for all species complexes. Eliminating markers with low phylogenetic signal tends to decrease uncertainty in the topology, regardless of species complex, and leads to a larger proportion of markers that support each lineage in the Bayesian concordance analyses. Finally, we reconstruct the phylogeny of each species complex using a minimal set of phylogenetic markers with the strongest phylogenetic signal and find the majority of species are strongly supported as monophyletic.",

    "abstract": "Fusarium species are distributed widely in ecosystems of a wide pH range and play a pivotal role in the aquatic community through the degradation of xenobiotic compounds and secretion of secondary metabolites. The elucidation of their genome would therefore be highly impactful with regard to the control of environmental pollution. Therefore, in this study, two indigenous strains of aquatic Fusarium, QHM and BWC1, were isolated from a coal mine pit and a subterranean river respectively, cultured under acidic conditions, and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of these two isolates was conducted based on the sequences of internal transcript (ITS1 and ITS4) and encoding {beta}-microtubulin (TUB2), translation elongation factors (TEFs) and the second large sub-unit of RNA polymerase (RPB2). Fusarium, QHM could potentially represent a new species within the Fusarium fujikuroi species complex. Fusarium BWC1 were found to form a clade with Fusarium subglutinans NRRL 22016, and predicted to be Fusarium subglutinans. Shot-gun sequencing on the Illumina Hiseqx10 Platform was used to elucidate the draft genomes of the two species. Gene annotation and functional analyses revealed that they had bio-degradation pathways for aromatic compounds; further, their main pathogenic mechanism was found to be the efflux pump. To date, the genomes of only a limited number of acidic species from the Fusarium fujikuroi species complex, especially from the aquatic species, have been sequenced. Therefore, the present findings are novel and have important potential for the future in terms of environmental control.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEFusarium genus has over 300 species and were distributed in a variety of ecosystem. Increasing attention has been drawn to Fusarium due to the importance in aquatic community, pathogenicity and environmental protection. The genomes of the strains in this work isolated in acidic condition, were sequenced. The analysis has indicated that the isolates were able to biodegrade xenobiotics, which makes it potentially function as environmental bio-agent for aromatic pollution control and remediation. Meanwhile, the virulence and pathogenicity were also predicted for reference of infection control. The genome information may lay foundation for the fungal identification, disease prevention resulting from these isolates and other \\\"-omics\\\" research. The isolates were phylogenetically classified into Fusarium fujikuroi species complex by means of concatenated gene analysis, serving as new addition to the big complex.",

    "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD) is increasingly available in e-cigarette liquids and other products. CBD use has been promoted for numerous purported benefits which have not been rigorously assessed in preclinical studies. The objective of this study was to further validate an inhalation model to assess CBD effects in the rat. The primary goal was to determine plasma CBD levels after vapor inhalation and compare that with the levels observed after injection. Secondary goals were to determine if hypothermia is produced in male Sprague-Dawley rats and if CBD affects nociception measured by the warm water tail-withdrawal assay. Blood samples were collected from rats exposed for 30 minutes to vapor generated by an e-cigarette device using CBD (100, 400 mg/mL in the propylene glycol vehicle). Separate experiments assessed the body temperature response to CBD in combination with nicotine (30 mg/mL) and the anti-nociceptive response to CBD. Vapor inhalation of CBD produced concentration-related plasma CBD levels in male and female Wistar rats that were within the range of levels produced by 10 or 30 mg/kg, CBD, i.p.. Dose-related hypothermia was produced by CBD in male Sprague-Dawley rats and this was partially attenuated by 5-HT1a receptor blockade. Nicotine (30 mg/mL) inhalation enhanced the effect of CBD. CBD inhalation had no effect on anti-nociception alone or in combination with {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol inhalation. The vapor-inhalation approach is a suitable pre-clinical model for the investigation of the effects of inhaled CBD. This route of administration produces hypothermia in rats, while i.p. injection does not at comparable plasma CBD levels.",

    "abstract": "Drugs and drug delivery systems have to traverse multiple biological barriers to achieve therapeutic efficacy. In diseases of mucosal-associated tissues such as cystic fibrosis (CF), successful delivery of gene and drug therapies remains a significant challenge due to an abnormally concentrated viscoelastic mucus, which prevents ~99% of all drugs and particles from penetrating the mucus barrier and the underlying epithelia for effective therapy, resulting in decreased survival. We used combinatorial peptide-presenting phage libraries and next-generation sequencing to identify hydrophilic, close to net-neutral charged peptides that penetrate the mucus barrier ex vivo in sputum from CF patients with ~600-fold better penetration than a positively charged control. After mucus penetration, nanoparticles conjugated with our selected peptides successfully translocated into lung epithelial cells derived from CF patients and demonstrated up to three-fold improved cell uptake compared to non-modified carboxylated- and gold standard PEGylated-nanoparticles. The selected peptides act as surface chemistries with synergistic functions to significantly improve the ability of drug delivery systems to overcome the human mucosal barriers and provide efficient cellular internalization. Our screening strategy provides a biologically-based discovery assay that directly addresses transport through mucus and cell barriers and has the potential to advance drug and gene delivery to multiple mucosal barriers.",

A block-interchange operation exchanges two blocks of a permutation which are not necessarily adjacent and in a prefix block-interchange, one block is always the prefix of that permutation. In this paper, we focus on applying prefix block-interchanges on binary and ternary strings. We present upper bounds to group and sort a given binary/ternary string. We also provide upper bounds for a different version of the block-interchange operation which we refer to as the  restricted prefix block-interchange. We observe that our obtained upper bound for restricted prefix block-interchange operations on binary strings is better than that of other genome rearrangement operations to group fully normalized binary strings. Consequently, we provide a linear-time algorithm to solve the problem of grouping binary normalized strings by restricted prefix block-interchanges. We also provide a polynomial time algorithm to group normalized ternary strings by prefix block-interchange operations. Finally, we provide a classification for ternary strings based on the required number of prefix block-interchange operations.",

    "abstract": "The phenotypic effects of genetic polymorphisms often depend on the genetic and environmental context. Here, we explore how polymorphic loci in large interaction networks contribute to complex trait variation and in particular how genetic effects and network topologies are influenced by environmental perturbations. This was done by reanalysing a dataset of >4,000 haploid yeast segregants grown on 20 different media. In total, 130 epistatic loci were associated with growth in at least one environment. The across-environment interaction network defined by these loci explained 69 - 100% of the narrow sense heritability in the individual environments. Environmental changes often resulted in network hubs being connected and disconnected from their interactors, leading to changes in additive effects of individual loci, epistatic effects of multi-locus interactions and the total level of genetic variance in growth. The largest variation in genetic effects across environments was found for epistatic loci that were highly connected network hubs in some environments but not in others. In environments where loci were highly connected, the segregating alleles epistatically suppressed or released genetic effects from their interactors. In environments where they were lowly connected, the same alleles made small or no contributions to growth. Hub-loci thus often serve as modulators, influencing the phenotypic effects of environmentally specific sets of interacting effector genes, rather than being effectors themselves. These findings illustrate the importance of the interplay between large genetic interactions networks and the living environment, both for individual phenotypes and population level metrics of genetic variation.",

    "abstract": "Many microorganisms produce resting cells with very low metabolic activity that allow them to survive phases of prolonged nutrient or energy stress. In cyanobacteria and some eukaryotic phytoplankton, the production of resting stages is accompanied by a loss of photosynthetic pigments, a process termed chlorosis. Here, we show that a chlorosis-like process occurs under multiple stress conditions in axenic laboratory cultures of Prochlorococcus, the dominant phytoplankton linage in large regions of the oligotrophic ocean and a global key player in ocean biogeochemical cycles. In Prochlorococcus strain MIT9313, chlorotic cells show reduced metabolic activity, measured as C and N uptake by NanoSIMS. However, unlike many other cyanobacteria, chlorotic Prochlorococcus cells are not viable and do not re-grow under axenic conditions when transferred to new media. Nevertheless, co-cultures with a heterotrophic bacterium, Alteromonas macleodii HOT1A3, allowed Prochlorococcus to survive nutrient starvation for months. We propose that reliance on co-occurring heterotrophic bacteria, rather than the ability to survive extended starvation as resting cells, underlies the ecological success of Prochlorococcus.\n\nImportanceThe ability of microorganisms to withstand long periods of nutrient starvation is key to their survival and success under highly fluctuating conditions as is common in nature. Therefore, one would expect this trait to be prevalent among organisms in the nutrient-poor open ocean. Here, we show that this is not the case for Prochlorococcus, a globally abundant and ecologically impactful marine cyanobacterium. Instead, Prochlorococcus rely on co-occurring heterotrophic bacteria to survive extended phases of nutrient and light starvation. Our results highlight the power of microbial interactions to drive major biogeochemical cycles in the ocean and elsewhere with consequences at the global scale.",

We characterized the evolved strains to find that: (1) whole genome sequencing of isolated clones from each evolved population revealed mutations in rpoC appearing in 5 of 6 sequenced clones; (2) gene expression profiles revealed different strategies to mitigate acid stress, that are related to amino acid metabolism and energy production and conversion. Thus, a combination of adaptive laboratory evolution, genome resequencing, and expression profiling reveals, on a genome-scale, the strategies that E. coli deploys to mitigate acid stress.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is one of the primary bacterial pathogens that complicates influenza virus infections. These bacterial coinfections increase influenza-associated morbidity and mortality through a number of immunological and viral-mediated mechanisms, but the specific bacterial genes that contribute to post-influenza pathogenicity are not known. Here, we used genome-wide transposon mutagenesis (Tn-Seq) to reveal bacterial genes that confer improved fitness in influenza-infected hosts. The majority of the 32 identified genes are involved in bacterial metabolism, including nucleotide biosynthesis, amino acid biosynthesis, protein translation, and membrane transport. We generated single-gene deletion (SGD) mutants of five identified genes: SPD1414, SPD2047 (cbiO1), SPD0058 (purD), SPD1098, and SPD0822 (proB), to investigate their effect on in vivo fitness, disease severity, and host immune responses. Growth of SGD mutants was slightly attenuated in vitro and in vivo, but each still grew to high titers in the lungs of mock- and influenza-infected hosts. Despite high bacterial loads, mortality was significantly reduced or delayed with all SGD mutants. Time-dependent reductions in pulmonary neutrophils, inflammatory macrophages, and select proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were also observed. Immunohistochemical staining further revealed that neutrophil phenotype and distribution was altered in the lungs of influenza-SGD coinfected animals. These studies demonstrate a critical role for specific bacterial genes and for bacterial metabolism in driving virulence and modulating immune function during influenza-associated bacterial pneumonia.",

Zebra finches and other songbirds have a sensitive period when young birds memorize a song to use as a model for vocal production. We found that intrinsic spiking dynamics change dramatically during this period in the caudal mesopallium, a cortical-level auditory area. Specifically, the proportion of neurons that only fire transiently at the onset of intracellular current injections increases, along with Kv1.1, a channel that facilitates transient spiking. Plasticity is greater in males and requires exposure to a complex, noisy environment. These observations indicate that intrinsic dynamics are modulated in response to the acoustic environment to support robust auditory processing during a critical phase of vocal learning.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to characterize acute changes in inflammatory pathways in the mouse eye following a blast-mediated TBI (bTBI) model, and to determine if modulation of these pathways could protect the structure and function of retinal ganglion cells (RGC). bTBI was induced in C57BL/6J male mice by exposure to three 20 PSI blast waves, with an interblast interval of one hour. Acute cytokine expression in retinal tissue was measured through real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) 4 hours post-blast. Increased retinal expression of lL-1{beta}, IL-1, IL-6, and TNF was observed in bTBI mice exposed to blast when compared to shams, which was associated with activation of microglia and macroglia reactivity, assessed via immunohistochemistry with IBA-1 and GFAP, respectively, 1 week post-blast. Inhibition of the IL-1 pathway was accomplished using anakina, an IL-1RI antagonist. Retinal function and structure were evaluated 4 weeks post-injury using pattern electroretinogram (PERG) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), respectively. After bTBI, anakinra treatment resulted in a preservation of RGC function and RGC structure when compared to saline treated bTBI mice. Optic nerve integrity analysis demonstrated a tred of decreased suggesting that IL-1 blockade also prevents axonal damage after blast. Blast exposure results in increased retinal inflammation including upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of resident microglia and macroglia. This may partially explain the RGC loss we observed in this model as blockade of the acute inflammatory response after injury with the IL-1R1 antagonist anakinra resulted in preservation of RGC function and structure.\\n\\nSignificance StatementBlast-mediated traumatic brain injury (bTBI) affects military members and civilians as a direct result of combat, workplace accidents, or intentional terrorist attacks. The retina is a central nervous system (CNS) tissue that is vulnerable to blast exposure. Individuals with bTBI often report visual dysfunction, but the mechanisms of ocular injury are poorly understood. This study demonstrates that damaging neuroinflammation contributes to retinal injury following blast-mediated TBI. We also identified anakinra, an anti-IL-1 therapy currently utilized for other diseases, as a potential pharmacologic agent that could prevent ocular damage after blast. These findings will aide in the development of novel treatments for vision preservation.",

In vitro assays revealed FA utilization throughout the GBM metabolome, and growth inhibition in nearly every cell line in a broad spectrum of patient-derived glioma cells treated with FAO inhibitors. In vivo assessments revealed that knockdown of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A), the rate limiting enzyme for FAO, reduced the rate of tumor growth and increased survival. However, the unrestricted ketogenic diet did not reduce tumor growth, and for some models significantly reduced survival. Altogether, these data highlight important roles for FA and ketone body metabolism that could serve to improve targeted therapies in GBM.",

    "abstract": "The ability of Cryptococcus neoformans to cause disease in humans varies significantly among strains with highly related genotypes. In general, environmental isolates of pathogenic species such as C. neoformans var. grubii have reduced virulence relative to clinical isolates, despite having no differences in the expression of the canonical virulence traits (high temperature growth, melanization and capsule formation). In this observation, we report that environmental isolates of C. neoformans tolerate host CO2 concentrations poorly compared to clinical isolates and that CO2 tolerance correlates well with the ability of the isolates to cause disease in mammals. Initial experiments also suggest that CO2 tolerance is particularly important for dissemination of C. neoformans from the lung to the brain. Furthermore, CO2 concentrations affect the susceptibility of both clinical and environmental C. neoformans isolates to the azole class of antifungal drugs, suggesting that antifungal testing in the presence of CO2 may improve the correlation between in vitro azole activity and patient outcome.\\n\\nImportanceA number of studies comparing either patient outcomes or model system virulence across large collections of Cryptococcus isolates have found significant heterogeneity in virulence even among strains with highly related genotypes. Because this heterogeneity cannot be explained by variations in the three well-characterized virulence traits (growth at host body temperature; melanization; and polysaccharide capsule formation), it has been widely proposed that additional C. neoformans virulence traits must exist. C. neoformans natural niche is in the environment where the carbon dioxide concentration is very low ([~]0.04%); in contrast, mammalian host tissue carbon dioxide concentrations are 125-fold higher (5%). We have found that the ability to grow in the presence of 5% carbon dioxide distinguishes low virulence strains from high virulence strains, even those with a similar genotype. Our findings suggest that carbon dioxide tolerance is a previously un-recognized virulence trait for C. neoformans.",

    "abstract": "We report the design of a mucin hydrogel created using a thiol-based cross-linking strategy. By using a cross-linking reagent capable of forming disulfide linkages between mucins, the mucin-based hydrogels possess viscoelastic properties comparable to native mucus as measured by bulk rheology. We confirmed disulfide cross-links mediate gel formation in our system using chemical treatments to block and reduce cysteines where we found mucin hydrogel network formation was inhibited and disrupted, respectively. Particle tracking microrheology was used to investigate the kinetics and evolution of microstructure and viscoelasticity within the hydrogel as it formed. We found that the rate of gel formation could be tuned by varying the mucin to crosslinker ratio, producing network pore sizes in the range measured previously in human mucus. The results of this work provide a new, simple method for creating mucin hydrogels with physiologically relevant properties using readily available reagents.",

    "abstract": "In solid tumors, increasing drug penetration promotes their regression and improves the therapeutic index of compounds. However, the heterogeneous extracellular matrix (ECM) acts a steric and interaction barrier that hinders effective transport of therapeutics, including nanomedicines. Specifically, the interactions between the ECM and surface physicochemical properties of nanomedicines (e.g. charge, hydrophobicity) impedes their diffusion and penetration. To address the challenges using existing surface chemistries, we used peptide-presenting phage libraries as a high-throughput approach to screen and identify peptides as coatings with desired physicochemical properties that improve diffusive transport through the tumor microenvironment. Through iterative screening against the ECM and identification by next-generation DNA sequencing and analysis, we selected individual clones and measured their transport by diffusion assays. Here, we identified a net-neutral charge, hydrophilic peptide P4 that facilitates significantly higher diffusive transport of phage than negative control through in vitro tumor ECM. Through alanine mutagenesis, we confirmed that the hydrophilicity, charge, and their spatial ordering impact diffusive transport. P4 phage clone exhibited almost 200-fold improved uptake in ex vivo pancreatic tumor xenografts compared to the negative control. Nanoparticles coated with P4 exhibited [~]40-fold improvement in diffusivity in pancreatic tumor tissues, and P4-coated particles demonstrated less hindered diffusivity through the ECM compared to particles functionalized with gold standard poly(ethylene) glycol or iRGD peptide ligand. By leveraging the power of molecular diversity using phage display, we can greatly expand the chemical space of surface chemistries that can improve the transport of nanomedicines through the complex tumor microenvironment to ultimately improve their efficacy.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=99 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/659524v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (23K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18bc04forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1feb597org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14403e5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5bbf6c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "SummaryGSEA-InContext Explorer is a Shiny app that allows users to perform two methods of gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). The first, GSEAPreranked, applies the GSEA algorithm in which statistical significance is estimated from a null distribution of enrichment scores generated for randomly permuted gene sets. The second, GSEA-InContext, incorporates a user-defined set of background experiments to define the null distribution and calculate statistical significance. GSEA-InContext Explorer allows the user to build custom background sets from a compendium of over 5,700 curated experiments, run both GSEAPreranked and GSEA-InContext on their own uploaded experiment, and explore the results using an interactive interface. This tool will allow researchers to visualize gene sets that are commonly enriched across experiments and identify gene sets that are uniquely significant in their experiment, thus complementing current methods for interpreting gene set enrichment results.\\n\\nAvailability and implementationThe code for GSEA-InContext Explorer is available at: https://github.com/CostelloLab/GSEA-InContext_Explorer and the interactive tool is at: http://gsea-incontext_explorer.ngrok.io",

In practice, heterogeneous gene-sets from diverse sources are frequently combined and used, resulting in gene-sets with overlapping genes. They compromise statistical modelling and complicate interpretation of results.\\n\\nResultsWe rephrase gene-set enrichment as a regression problem. Given some genes of interest (e.g. a list of hits from an experiment) and gene-sets (e.g. functional annotations or pathways), we aim to identify a sparse list of gene-sets for the genes of interest. In a regression framework, this amounts to identifying a minimum set of gene-sets that optimally predicts whether any gene belongs to the given genes of interest. To accommodate redundancy between gene-sets, we propose regularized regression techniques such as the elastic net. We report that regression-based results are consistent with established gene-set enrichment methods but more parsimonious and interpretable.\\n\\nAvailabilityWe implement the model in gerr (gene-set enrichment with regularized regression), an R package freely available at https://github.com/TaoDFang/gerr and submitted to Bioconductor.

Members of the PAK family are overexpressed in human breast cancer, but their role in mammary gland development is not fully explored. Here we examined the functional role of PAK4 in mammary gland development by creating a mouse model of MMTV-Cre driven conditional PAK4 gene depletion in the mammary gland. The PAK4 conditional knock-out mice were born healthy with no observed developmental deficits. Mammary gland whole-mounts revealed no defects in ductal formation or elongation of the mammary tree through the fat pad. PAK4 gene depletion also did not alter proliferation and invasion of the mammary epithelium in young virgin mice. Moreover, adult mice gave birth to healthy pups with normal body weight upon weaning. This implies that MMTV-Cre induced gene depletion of PAK4 in mice does not impair normal mammary gland development and thereby provides an in vivo model for examination of the potential function of PAK4 in breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "The canonical model of sex-chromosome evolution assigns a key role to sexually antagonistic (SA) genes on the arrest of recombination and ensuing degeneration of Y chromosomes. This assumption cannot be tested in organisms with highly differentiated sex chromosomes, such as mammals or birds, owing to the lack of polymorphism. Fixation of SA alleles, furthermore, might be the consequence rather than the cause of recombination arrest. Here we focus on a population of common frogs (Rana temporaria) where XY males with genetically differentiated Y chromosomes (non-recombinant Y haplotypes) coexist with both XY{degrees} males with proto-Y chromosomes (only differentiated from X chromosomes in the immediate vicinity of the candidate sex-determining locus Dmrt1) and XX males with undifferentiated sex chromosomes (genetically identical to XX females). Our study shows no effect of sex-chromosome differentiation on male phenotype, mating success or fathering success. Our conclusions rejoin genomic studies that found no differences in gene expression between XY, XY{degrees} and XX males. Sexual dimorphism in common frogs seems to result from the differential expression of autosomal genes rather than sex-linked SA genes. Among-male variance in sex-chromosome differentiation is better explained by a polymorphism in the penetrance of alleles at the sex locus, resulting in variable levels of sex reversal (and thus of X-Y recombination in XY females), independent of sex-linked SA genes.\\n\\nImpact Summary\\n\\nHumans, like other mammals, present highly differentiated sex chromosomes, with a large, gene-rich X chromosome contrasting with a small, gene-poor Y chromosome. This differentiation results from a process that started approximately 160 Mya, when the Y first stopped recombining with the X. How and why this happened, however, remain controversial. According to the canonical model, the process was initiated by sexually antagonistic selection; namely, selection on the proto-Y chromosome for alleles that were beneficial to males but detrimental to females. The arrest of XY recombination then allowed such alleles to be only transmitted to sons, not to daughters. Although appealing and elegant, this model can no longer be tested in mammals, as it requires a sex-chromosome system at an incipient stage of evolution. Here we focus on a frog that displays within-population polymorphism is sex-chromosome differentiation, where XY males with differentiated chromosomes coexist with XX males lacking Y chromosomes. We find no effect of sex-chromosome differentiation on male phenotype or mating success, opposing expectations from the standard model. Sex linked genes do not seem to have a disproportionate effect on sexual dimorphism. From our results, sexually antagonistic genes show no association with sex-chromosome differentiation in frogs, which calls for alternative models of sex-chromosome evolution.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenome-wide association studies have identified 150+ loci associated with lipid levels. However, the genetic mechanisms underlying most of these loci are not well-understood. Recent work indicates that changes in the abundance of alternatively spliced transcripts contributes to complex trait variation. Consequently, identifying genetic loci that associate with alternative splicing in disease-relevant cell types and determining the degree to which these loci are informative for lipid biology is of broad interest.\\n\\nMethods and ResultsWe analyze gene splicing in 83 sample-matched induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) and hepatocyte-like cell (HLC) lines (n=166), as well as in an independent collection of primary liver tissues (n=96). We observe that transcript splicing is highly cell-type specific, and the genes that are differentially spliced between iPSCs and HLCs are enriched for metabolism pathway annotations. We identify 1,381 HLC splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs) and 1,462 iPSC sQTLs and find that sQTLs are often shared across cell types. To evaluate the contribution of sQTLs to variation in lipid levels, we conduct colocalization analysis using lipid genome-wide association data. We identify 19 lipid-associated loci that colocalize either with an HLC expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) or sQTL. Only one locus colocalizes with both an sQTL and eQTL, indicating that sQTLs contribute information about GWAS loci that cannot be obtained by analysis of steady-state gene expression alone.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results provide an important foundation for future efforts that use iPSC and iPSC-derived cells to evaluate genetic mechanisms influencing both cardiovascular disease risk and complex traits in general.",

This Lake is exsposed to agriculture run off, industrial and Urban waste since it has not buffer zone to protect any invading materials to the water body.

Some cyanobacterial species produce toxin microcystins and anatoxin molecules can affect the liver, kideney and nervous system of animals because the toxic molecules of released from some toxic cyanobacteria may lead the organs to fail the metabolice system. The major exposure pathways of these toxins are through drinking water and recreations including swimming. In addition, these problems happen through food web. Those cyanobacteriaa are spread and growth in diffrent water body via agriculture run off, industrial and urban wastes and other nutrient source of N and P. The main goal of this scientific study was to assess the distribution of potential toxic cyanobacteria in Lake Tana. Cyano bacterial distributions were studied in different water bodies of Lake Tana.

    "abstract": "Stem and progenitor cells undergo a global elevation of nascent transcription, or hypertranscription, during key developmental transitions involving rapid cell proliferation. The chromatin remodeler Chd1 binds to genes transcribed by RNA Polymerase (Pol) I and II and is required for hypertranscription in embryonic stem (ES) cells in vitro and the early post-implantation epiblast in vivo. Biochemically, Chd1 has been shown to facilitate transcription at least in part by removing nucleosomal barriers to elongation, but its mechanism of action in stem cells remains poorly understood. Here we report a novel role for Chd1 in the repair of promoter-proximal endogenous double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) in ES cells. An unbiased proteomics approach revealed that Chd1 interacts with several DNA repair factors including Atm, Parp1, Kap1 and Topoisomerase 2{beta}. We show that wild-type ES cells display high levels of phosphorylated H2A.X and Kap1 at chromatin, notably at rDNA in the nucleolus, in a Chd1-dependent manner. Loss of Chd1 leads to an extensive accumulation of DSBs at Chd1-bound Pol II-transcribed genes and rDNA. Genes prone to DNA breaks in Chd1 KO ES cells tend to be longer genes with GC-rich promoters, a more labile nucleosomal structure and roles in chromatin regulation, transcription and signaling. These results reveal a vulnerability of hypertranscribing stem cells to endogenous DNA breaks, with important implications for developmental and cancer biology.",

Studies have shown that the insular cortex is a key brain area for graviception.

Here, participants either mentally simulated (only predictive) or performed (predictive and reactive) vertical movements of the hand.

Small sample sizes and heterogeneous methodology have been suspected in driving these inconsistencies. Here, we tested for associations between the Big Five personality traits and multiple measures of brain structure using data from 1,107 university students (636 women, mean age 19.69{+/-}1.24 years) representing the largest attempt to date. In addition to replication analyses based on a prior study, we conducted exploratory whole-brain analyses. Four supplementary analyses were also conducted to examine 1) possible associations with lower-order facets of personality; 2) modulatory effects of sex; 3) effect of controlling for non-target personality traits; and 4) parcellation scheme effects. The analyses failed to identify any significant associations between the Big Five personality traits and variability in measures of cortical thickness, surface area, subcortical volume, or white matter microstructural integrity, except for an association between greater surface area of the superior temporal gyrus and lower scores on conscientiousness that explained 0.44% of the morphometric measures variance. Notably however, the latter association is largely not supported by previous studies. The supplementary analyses mirrored these largely null findings, suggesting they were not substantively biased by our choice of analytic model. Collectively, these results indicate that if there are direct associations between the Big Five personality traits and variability in brain structure, they are of likely very small effect sizes and will require very large samples for reliable detection.",

However, little is known about the key metabolic differences between different strains of these bifidobacteria, and consequently, their suitability for their varied commercial applications. In this context, the present study applies a constraint-based modelling approach to differentiate between 36 important bifidobacterial strains, enhancing their genome-scale metabolic models obtained from the AGORA (Assembly of Gut Organisms through Reconstruction and Analysis) resource. By studying various growth and metabolic capabilities in these enhanced genome-scale models across 30 different nutrient environments, we classified the bifidobacteria into three specific groups. We also studied the ability of the different strains to produce short chain fatty acids, finding that acetate production is niche- and strain-specific, unlike lactate. Further, we captured the role of critical enzymes from the bifid shunt pathway, which was found to be essential for a subset of bifidobacterial strains. Our findings underline the significance of analysing metabolic capabilities as a powerful approach to explore distinct properties of the gut microbiome. Overall, our study presents several insights into the nutritional lifestyles of bifidobacteria and could potentially be leveraged to design species/strain-specific probiotics or prebiotics.",

    "abstract": "Computational models of network-driven processes have become a standard to explain cellular systems-level behavior and predict cellular responses to perturbations. Modern models can span a broad range of biochemical reactions and species that, in principle, comprise the complexity of dynamic cellular processes. Visualization plays a central role in the analysis of biochemical network processes to identify patterns that arise from model dynamics and perform model exploratory analysis. However, most existing visualization tools are limited in their capabilities to facilitate mechanism exploration of large, dynamic, and complex models. Here, we present PyViPR, a visualization tool that provides researchers static and dynamic representations of biochemical network processes within a Python-based Literate Programming environment. PyViPR embeds network visualizations on Jupyter notebooks, thus facilitating integration with Python modeling, simulation, and analysis workflows. To present the capabilities of PyViPR, we explore execution mechanisms of extrinsic apoptosis in HeLa cells. We show how community-detection algorithms can identify groups of molecular species that represent key biological regulatory functions and simplify the apoptosis network by placing those groups into interactively collapsible nodes. We then show how dynamic execution of a signal, under different kinetic parameter sets that fit the experimental data equally well, exhibit significantly different signal-execution modes in mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabilization - the point of no return in extrinsic apoptosis execution. Therefore, PyViPR aids the conceptual understanding of dynamic network processes and accelerates hypothesis generation for further testing and validation.",

    "abstract": "A widely accepted model for the evolution of cave animals posits colonization by surface ancestors followed by the acquisition of adaptations over many generations. However, the speed of cave adaptation in some species suggests mechanisms operating over shorter timescales. To address these mechanisms, we used Astyanax mexicanus, a teleost with ancestral surface morphs (surface fish, SF) and derived cave morphs (cavefish, CF). We exposed SF to completely dark conditions and identified numerous altered traits at both the gene expression and phenotypic levels. Remarkably, most of these alterations mimicked CF phenotypes. Our results indicate that cave-related traits can appear within a single generation by phenotypic plasticity. In the next generation, plasticity can be further refined. The initial plastic responses are random in adaptive outcome but may determine the subsequent course of evolution. Our study suggests that phenotypic plasticity contributes to the rapid evolution of cave-related traits in A. mexicanus.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTest the hypothesis that individual differences in episodic memory and verbal fluency in cognitively normal middle-aged adults will predict progression to amnestic MCI after 6 years.\\n\\nMethodThe analysis sample included 842 male twins who were cognitively normal at baseline (M=56 years), completed measures of episodic memory and verbal fluency at baseline and again 6 years later (M=62 years).\\n\\nResultsPoor episodic memory predicted progression to both amnestic MCI (OR=4.42, 95% CI [2.44, 10.60]) and non-amnestic MCI (OR=1.92, 95% CI [1.32, 3.44]). Poor semantic verbal fluency also independently predicted progression to amnestic MCI (OR=1.86, 95% CI [1.12, 3.52]). In the full sample, a semantic-specific fluency latent variable at wave 1 (which controls for letter fluency) predicted change in episodic memory at wave 2 ({beta}=.13), but not vice-versa ({beta}=.04). Associations between episodic memory and verbal fluency factors were primarily explained by genetic, rather than environmental, correlations.\\n\\nConclusionsAmong individuals who were cognitively normal at wave 1, episodic memory moderately-to-strongly predicted progression to MCI at average age 62, emphasizing the fact that there is still meaningful variability even among cognitively normal individuals. Episodic memory, which is typically a primary focus for AD risk, declined earlier and more quickly than fluency. However, semantic fluency at average age 56 predicted 6-year change in memory as well as progression to amnestic MCI even after accounting for baseline memory performance. These findings emphasize the utility of memory and fluency measures in early identification of AD risk.",

    "abstract": "We dissected the genetic basis of total spikelet number (TSN) along with other traits, namely spike length (SL) and flowering time (FT) in a panel of 518 elite European winter wheat varieties. Genome-wide association studies based on 39,908 SNP markers revealed highly significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) for TSN on chromosomes 2D, 7A, and 7B, for SL on 5A, and FT on 2D, with 2D-QTL being the functional marker for the gene Ppd-D1. The physical region of the 7A-QTL for TSN revealed the presence of an ortholog to APO1 - a rice gene that positively controls spikelet number on panicles. Interspecific analyses of TaAPO-A1 orthologs showed that it is a highly conserved gene important for floral development, and present in a wide range of terrestrial plants. Intraspecific studies of the wheat ortholog TaAPO-A1 across wheat genotypes revealed a polymorphism in the highly conserved F-box domain, defining two haplotypes. A KASP maker developed on the polymorphic site showed a highly significant association of TaAPO-A1 with TSN, explaining 23.2% of the genotypic variance. Also, the TaAPO-A1 alleles showed weak but significant differences for SL and grain yield. Our results demonstrate the importance of wheat sequence resources to identify candidate genes for important traits based on genetic analyses.",

    "abstract": "During plant litter decomposition in soils, carbon has two general fates: return to the atmosphere via microbial respiration or transport into soil where long-term storage may occur. Discovering microbial community features that drive carbon fate from litter decomposition may improve modeling and management of soil carbon. This concept assumes there are features (or underlying processes) that are widespread among disparate communities, and therefore amenable to modeling. We tested this assumption using an epidemiological approach in which two contrasting patterns of carbon flow in laboratory microcosms were delineated as functional states and diverse microbial communities representing each state were compared to discover shared features linked to carbon fate. Microbial communities from 206 soil samples from the southwestern United States were inoculated on plant litter in microcosms, and carbon flow was measured as cumulative carbon dioxide (CO2) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) after 44 days. Carbon flow varied widely among the microcosms, with a 2-fold range in cumulative CO2 efflux and a 5-fold range in DOC quantity. Bacteria, not fungi, were the strongest drivers of DOC variation. The most significant community-level feature linked to DOC abundance was bacterial richness--the same feature linked to carbon fate in human-gut microbiome studies. This proof-of-principle study under controlled conditions suggests common features driving carbon flow in disparate microbial communities can be identified, motivating further exploration of underlying mechanisms that may influence carbon fate in natural ecosystems.",

In hopes of developing a list of candidate biological measures that reflect and relate closely to the severity of depressive symptoms, so-called \\\"state-dependent\\\" biomarkers of depression, this pilot study explored the biochemical underpinnings of treatment response to cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) in medication-freeMDD outpatients. Plasma samples were collected at baseline and week 12 from a subset of MDD patients (N=26) who completed a course of CBT treatment as part of the Predictors of Remission in Depression to Individual and Combined Treatments (PReDICT) study. Targeted metabolomic profiling using the the AbsoluteIDQ(R) p180 Kit and LC-MS identified eight \\\"co-expressed\\\" metabolomic modules. Of these eight, three were significantly associated with change in depressive symptoms over the course of the 12-weeks. Metabolites found to be most strongly correlated with change in depressive symptoms were branched chain amino acids, acylcarnitines, methionine sulfoxide, and -aminoadipic acid (negative correlations with symptom change) as well as several lipids, particularly the phosphatidlylcholines (positive correlation). These results implicate disturbed bioenergetics as an important state marker in the pathobiology of MDD. Exploratory analyses contrasting remitters to CBT versus those who failed the treatment further suggest these metabolites may serve as mediators of recovery during CBT treatment. Larger studies examining metabolomic change patterns in patients treated with pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy will be necessary to elucidate the biological underpinnings of MDD and the -specific biologies of treatment response.",

    "abstract": "In many ways, the complement of cell subtypes determines the information processing that a local brain circuit can perform. For example, the balance of excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) signaling within a brain region contributes to response magnitude and specificity in ways that influence the effectiveness of information processing. An extreme example of response changes to sensory information occur across Critical Periods (CPs). In primary mammalian visual cortex, GAD65 and parvalbumin inhibitory cell types in particular control experience-dependent responses during a CP. Here, we test how the density of GAD65- and parvalbumin-expressing cells may inform on a CP for complex behavioral learning. Juvenile male zebra finch songbirds (females cannot sing) learn to sing through coordinated sensory, sensorimotor, and motor learning processes distributed throughout a well-defined neural network. There is a CP is for sensory learning, the stage during which a young male forms a memory of his \\\"tutors\\\" song, which is then used to guide the young birds emerging song structure. We quantified the effect of sex and experience with a tutor on the cell densities of GAD65- and parvalbumin-expressing cells across major nodes of the song network, using ages that span the CP for tutor song memorization. As a resource, we also include whole-brain mapping data for both genes. Results indicate that inhibitory cell populations differ across sex, age, and experiential conditions, but not always in the ways we predicted.",

    "abstract": "Since its introduction in 1990 and with over 50k citations, the NCBI BLAST family has been an essential tool of in silico molecular biology. The BLAST nt database, based on the traditional divisions of GenBank, has been the default and most comprehensive database for nucleotide BLAST searches and for taxonomic classification software in metagenomics. Here we argue that this is no longer the case. Currently, the NCBI WGS database contains one billion reads (almost five times more than GenBank), and with 4.4 trillion nucleotides, WGS has about 14 times more nucleotides than GenBank. This ratio is growing with time. We advocate a change in the database paradigm in taxonomic classification by systematically combining the nt and WGS databases in order to boost taxonomic classifiers sensitivity. We present here a case in which, by adding WGS data, we obtained over five times more classified reads and with a higher confidence score. To facilitate the adoption of this approach, we provide the draftGenomes script.\\n\\nAuthor summaryCulture-independent methods are revolutionizing biology. The NIH/NCBI Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) is one of the most widely used methods in computational biology. The BLAST nt database has become a de facto standard for taxonomic classifiers in metagenomics. We believe that it is time for a change in the database paradigm for such a classification. We advocate the systematic combination of the BLAST nt database with genomes of the massive NCBI Whole-Genome Shotgun (WGS) database. We make draftGenomes available, a script that eases the adoption of this approach. Current developments and technologies make it feasible now. Our recent results in several metagenomic projects indicate that this strategy boosts the sensitivity in taxonomic classifications.",

    "abstract": "There is a need to accurately call human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes from existing short-read sequencing data, however there is no single solution that matches the gold standard of lab typing. Here we aimed to combine results from available software, minimising the biases of applied algorithm and HLA reference. The result is a robust HLA population resource for the published 1 000 Swedish genomes, and a framework for future HLA interrogation. HLA 2-field alleles were called using four imputation and inference methods for the classical eight genes (class I: HLA-A, -B, -C; class II: HLA-DPA1, -DPB1, -DQA1, -DQB1, -DRB1). A high confidence population set (SweHLA) was determined using an n-1 concordance rule for class I (four software) and class II (three software) alleles. Results were compared across populations and individual programs benchmarked to SweHLA. Per allele, 875 to 988 of the 1 000 samples were genotyped in SweHLA; 920 samples had at least seven loci. While a small fraction of reference alleles were common to all software (class I=1.9% and class II=4.1%), this did not affect the overall call rate. Gene-level concordance was high compared to European populations (>0.83%), with COX and PGF the dominant SweHLA haplotypes. We noted that 15/18 discordant alleles (delta allele frequency > 2) were previously reported as disease-associated. These differences could in part explain across-study genetic replication failures, reinforcing the need to use multiple software. SweHLA demonstrates a way to use existing NGS data to generate a population resource agnostic to individual HLA software biases.",

We confirmed that a distinct placenta microbiome does exist, as compared to the environmental background. The placenta microbiome consists predominantly of Lactobacillus, Enterococcus and Chryseobacterium. Moreover, the microbiome in the placentas of obese pre-pregnant mothers are less diverse when compared to those of mothers of normal pre-pregnancy weight. Lastly, microbiome richness also decreases from the maternal side to fetal side.

The OB is intimately involved in a long list of olfactory tasks, has been suggested to fulfill a role comparable to that of V1 and the thalamus in the visual system, and have been closely linked to a wide range of neuropathologies. Here we present a method for non-invasive recording of signals from the human OB with millisecond precision. We demonstrate that signals obtained via recordings from EEG electrodes at the nasal bridge represent responses from the olfactory bulb - recordings we term Electrobulbogram (EBG). The EBG is localized to the OB, is reliable, and follows response patterns demonstrated in non-human animal models. The EBG will aid future olfactory-related translational work but can also easily be implemented as an everyday clinical tool to detect pathology-related changes in human central olfactory processing in neurodegenerative diseases.",

However, the molecular underpinnings controlling the spatiotemporal redistribution of Mad1-C-Mad2 as cells progress into mitosis remain elusive. Here, we show that Mps1-mediated phosphorylation of Megator/Tpr abolishes its interaction with Mad1 in vitro and in Drosophila cells. Timely activation of Mps1 during prophase triggers Mad1 release from NPCs, which we find to be required for competent kinetochore recruitment of Mad1-C-Mad2 and robust checkpoint response. Importantly, preventing Mad1 binding to Megator/Tpr rescues the fidelity of chromosome segregation and aneuploidy in larval neuroblasts of Drosophila mps1-null mutants. Our findings demonstrate that the subcellular localization of Mad1 is stringently coordinated with cell cycle progression by kinetochore-extrinsic activity of Mps1. This ensures that both NPCs in interphase and kinetochores in mitosis can generate anaphase inhibitors to efficiently preserve genomic stability.",

    "abstract": "In the accompanying chapter (Gressel, Lidschreiber, Cramer), we describe the detailed experimental protocol for transient transcriptome sequencing (TT-seq). TT-seq detects metabolically labeled, newly synthesized RNA fragments genome-wide in living cells. TT-seq can monitor gene activity and the dynamics of enhancer landscapes with great sensitivity, but this requires careful computational analysis of the data. In this manuscript, we present the bioinformatics workflow used to analyze TT-seq data. In particular, we describe pre-processing steps, including a reliable and robust normalization strategy, and several downstream analysis tools that enable the user to quantify RNA synthesis, splicing and degradation activities. Together, these tools form a comprehensive analysis pipeline that can be adapted to almost any TT-seq application.",

To identify the cellular trajectories of lineage specification during limb bud development, we used single cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile the developing murine hindlimb between embryonic days (E)11.5-E18.5. We found cell type heterogeneity at all time points, and the expected cell types that form the mouse hindlimb.

We clarified the characteristics of the students who access counseling services using both psychological tests and pulse rate variability (PRV).\\n\\nMethodsWe recruited the participants for this study from the students who had counseling sessions at Kanazawa University (Group S). As a control group, we also recruited students who had no experience in counseling sessions (Group H). We obtained health information from the database of annual health check-ups. Participants received the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) III, Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ), Sukemune-Hiew (S-H) Resilience Test, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-JYZ (STAI). We also studied the SF-12v2 Health Survey. We examined the spectral analyses of pulse rate variability (PRV) by accelerating plethysmography. We performed linear analysis of PRV for LF, HF, and LF/HF as indexes of autonomic nervous function. We also performed non-linear analysis of PRV for the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE). We examined participants blood for autoantibodies against glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) 65.\\n\\nResultsA total of 105 students participated in this study. Group S had 37 participants (Male: 26, Female: 11) and Group H had 68 participants (Male: 27, Female 41). There were 12 males and two females who had been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in Group S. Group S had 1) lower Working Memory Index (WMI) despite relatively high Full-Scale IQ, 2) higher AQ scores, 3) lower resilience scores, 4) higher anxiety scores, 5)lower QOL in social health, and 6) shifting of autonomic nervous balance toward higher sympathetic activity. There were only two participants who had the anti-GAD65 antibody in Group S, and one participant had the anti-GAD65 antibody in Group H.\\n\\nConclusionThe results of our study revealed valuable information about the students who seek mental support in our university.

    "abstract": "Organization of mammalian inhibitory synapses is thought to be crucial for normal brain functions, but the underlying molecular mechanisms have been still incompletely understood. IQSEC3 (IQ motif and Sec7 domain 3) is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF-GEF) that directly interacts with gephyrin. Here, we show that GABAergic synapse-specific transcription factor, Npas4 (neuronal PAS domain protein 4) directly binds to the promoter of Iqsec3 and regulates its transcription. Strikingly, an enriched environment (EE) induced Npas4 upregulation and concurrently increased IQSEC3 protein levels specifically in mouse CA1 stratum oriens layer somatostatin (SST)-expressing GABAergic interneurons, which are compromised in Npas4-knockout (KO) mice. Moreover, expression of wild-type (WT) IQSEC3, but not a dominant-negative (DN) ARF-GEF-inactive mutant, rescued the decreased GABAergic synaptic transmission in Npas4-deficient SST interneurons. Concurrently, expression of IQSEC3 WT normalized the altered GABAergic synaptic transmission in dendrites, but not soma, of Npas4-deficient CA1 pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, expression of IQSEC3 WT, but not IQSEC3 DN, in SST-expressing interneurons in CA1 SST Npas4-KO mice rescued the altered anxiety-like behavior. Collectively, our results suggest that IQSEC3 is a key GABAergic synapse component that is directed by Npas4 activity- and ARF activity-dependent gene programs in SST-expressing interneurons to orchestrate the functional excitation-to-inhibition balance.",

    "abstract": "Living cells are able to regulate key cellular processes by physically assembling signaling components on dedicated molecular platforms. The spatial organization of proteins in these higher-order signaling complexes facilitates proximity-driven activation and inhibition events, allowing tight regulation of the flow of information. Here, we employ the programmability and modularity of DNA origami as a controllable molecular platform for studying protein-protein interactions involved in intracellular signaling. Specifically, we engineer a synthetic, DNA origami-based version of the apoptosome, a large multi-protein signaling complex that regulates apoptosis by co-localization of multiple caspase-9 monomers. Our in vitro characterization using both wildtype caspase-9 monomers and inactive mutants tethered to a DNA origami platform directly demonstrates that enzymatic activity is induced by proximity-driven dimerization with asymmetric, half-of-sites reactivity. Additionally, experimental results supported by a detailed thermodynamic model reveal a multivalent activity enhancement in tethered caspase-9 oligomers of three and four enzymes, partly originating from a statistical increase in the number of active catalytic units in higher-order enzyme clusters. Our results offer fundamental insights in caspase-9 activity regulation and demonstrate that DNA origami provides a modular platform to construct and characterize higher-order signaling complexes. The engineered DNA-based protein assembly platform has the potential to be broadly applied to inform the function of other important multi-enzyme assemblies involved in inflammation, innate immunity, and necrosis.",

    "abstract": "Nucleosomes restrict DNA accessibility throughout eukaryotic genomes, with repercussions for replication, transcription, and other DNA-templated processes. How this globally restrictive organization emerged from a presumably more open ancestral state remains poorly understood. Here, to better understand the challenges associated with establishing globally restrictive chromatin, we express histones in a naive bacterial system that has not evolved to deal with nucleosomal structures: Escherichia coli. We find that histone proteins from the archaeon Methanothermus fervidus assemble on the E. coli chromosome in vivo and protect DNA from micrococcal nuclease digestion, allowing us to map binding footprints genome-wide. We provide evidence that nucleosome occupancy along the E. coli genome tracks intrinsic sequence preferences but is disturbed by ongoing transcription and replication. Notably, we show that higher nucleosome occupancy at promoters and across gene bodies is associated with lower transcript levels, consistent with local repressive effects. Surprisingly, however, this sudden enforced chromatinization has only mild repercussions for growth, suggesting that histones can become established as ubiquitous chromatin proteins without interfering critically with key DNA-templated processes. Our results have implications for the evolvability of transcriptional ground states and highlight chromatinization by archaeal histones as a potential avenue for controlling genome accessibility in synthetic prokaryotic systems.",

    "abstract": "Advances in fluorescence microscopy have introduced new assays to quantify live-cell translation dynamics at single-RNA resolution. We introduce a detailed, yet efficient sequence-based stochastic model that generates realistic synthetic data for several such assays, including Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS), ribosome Run-Off Assays (ROA) after Harringtonine application, and Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP). We simulate these experiments under multiple imaging conditions and for thousands of human genes, and we evaluate through simulations which experiments are most likely to provide accurate estimates of elongation kinetics. Finding that FCS analyses are optimal for both short and long length genes, we integrate our model with experimental FCS data to capture the nascent protein statistics and temporal dynamics for three human genes: KDM5B, {beta}-actin, and H2B. Finally, we introduce a new open-source software package, RNA Sequence to NAscent Protein Simulator (O_SCPCAPRC_SCPCAPSNAPO_SCPCAPSIMC_SCPCAP), to easily simulate the single-molecule translation dynamics of any gene sequence for any of these assays and for different assumptions regarding synonymous codon usage, tRNA level modifications, or ribosome pauses.

Recent advances in time-lapse fluorescence microscopy allow live-cell quantification of translation dynamics at the resolution of single mRNA molecules. Here, we develop a flexible computational framework to reproduce and interpret such experiments. We use this framework to explore how well different single-mRNA translation experiment designs would perform to estimate key translation parameters. We then integrate experimental data from the most flexible design with our stochastic model framework to reproduce the statistics and temporal dynamics of nascent protein elongation for three different human genes. Our validated computational method is packaged with a simple graphical user interface that (1) starts with mRNA sequences, (2) generates discrete, codon-dependent translation models, (3) provides visualization of ribosome movement as trajectories or kymographs, and (4) allows the user to estimate how optical single-mRNA translation experiments would be affected by different genetic alterations (e.g., codon substitutions) or environmental perturbations (e.g., tRNA titrations or drug treatments).",

    "abstract": "Spatial dynamics can promote the evolution of cooperation. While dispersal processes have been studied in simple evolutionary games, real-world social dilemmas are much more complicated. The public good, in many cases, does not increase linearly as per the investment in it. When the investment is low, for example, every additional unit of the investment may help a lot to increase the public good, but the effect vanishes as the number of investments increase. Such non-linear behaviour is the norm rather than an exception in a variety of social as well as biological systems. We take into account the non-linearity in the payoffs of the public goods game as well as the natural demographic effects of population densities. Population density has also been shown to impact the evolution of co-operation. Coupling these non-linear games and population size effect together with an explicitly defined spatial structure brings us one step closer to the complexity of real eco-evolutionary spatial systems. We show how the non-linearity in payoffs, resulting in synergy or discounting of public goods can alter the effective rate of return on the cooperative investment. Synergy or discounting in public goods accumulation affects the resulting spatial structure, not just quantitatively but in some cases, drastically changing the outcomes. In cases where a linear payoff structure would lead to extinction, synergy can support the coexistence of cooperators and defectors. The combined eco-evolutionary trajectory can thus be qualitatively different in cases on non-linear social dilemmas.",

The mechanism of termination, including the RNA target of the DEAH-box ATPase Prp43, remains ambiguous. We discovered a critical role for nucleotides at the 3-end of the catalytic U6 small nuclear RNA in splicing termination. Though conserved sequence at the 3-end is not required, 2 hydroxyls are, paralleling requirements for Prp43 biochemical activities. While the 3-end of U6 is not required for recruiting Prp43 to the spliceosome, the 3 end crosslinks directly to Prp43 in an RNA-dependent manner. Our data indicate a mechanism of splicing termination in which Prp43 translocates along U6 from the 3 end to disassemble the spliceosome and thereby release suboptimal substrates or excised introns. This mechanism reveals that the spliceosome becomes primed for termination at the same stage it becomes activated for catalysis, implying a requirement for stringent control of spliceosome activity within the cell.",

These studies have largely ignored the role of precursor fixations, previous fixations on locations the eyes return to later. We consider the possibility that preparations to return later are already made during precursor fixations. This would mark precursor fixations as a special category of fixations, i.e., distinct in neural activity from other fixation categories such as refixations and fixations to locations visited only once. To capture the neural signals associated with fixation categories, we analyzed EEG and eye movement recorded simultaneously in a free-viewing contour search task. We developed a methodological pipeline involving regression-based deconvolution modeling, allowing our analyses to account for overlapping EEG responses due to the saccade sequence and other oculomotor covariates. We found that precursor fixations were preceded by the largest saccades among the fixation categories. Independently of the effect of saccade length, EEG amplitude was enhanced in precursor fixations compared to the other fixation categories 200-400 ms after fixation onsets, most noticeably over the occipital areas. We concluded that precursor fixations play a pivotal role in visual perception, marking the continuous occurrence of transitions between exploratory and exploitative modes of eye movement in natural viewing behavior.",

Viomega includes sample collection, ambient temperature sample preservation, total RNA extraction, physical removal of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), preparation of directional Illumina libraries, Illumina sequencing, taxonomic classification based on a database of >110,000 microbial genomes, and quantitative microbial gene expression analysis using a database of ~100 million microbial genes. We applied this method to 10,000 human stool samples, and performed several small-scale studies to demonstrate sample stability and consistency. In summary, Viomega is an inexpensive, high throughput, automated, and accurate sample-to-result stool metatranscriptomic technology platform for large-scale studies and a wide range of applications.",

    "abstract": "Inducing {beta}-cell proliferation could inhibit diabetes progression. Many factors have been suggested as potential {beta}-cell mitogens, but their impact on {beta}-cell replication has not been confirmed due to the lack of a standardized {beta}-cell proliferation assay. In this study, we developed a novel method that specifically labels replicating {beta} cells and yields more reproducible results than current immunohistochemical assays. We established a mouse line expressing the fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (Fucci2a) reporter only in {beta} cells through Cre-mediated recombination under the control of the rat insulin promoter (RIP-Cre;Fucci2aR). Three-dimensional imaging of optically cleared pancreas tissue from these mice enabled the quantification of replicating {beta} cells in islets and morphometric analysis of islets following mitogen treatment. Intravital imaging of RIP-Cre;Fucci2aR mice revealed cell cycle progression of {beta} cells. Thus, this novel mouse line is a powerful tool for spatiotemporal analysis of {beta}-cell proliferation in response to mitogen stimulation.",

    "abstract": "Linker histones are epigenetic regulators that bind to nucleosomes and alter chromatin structures and dynamics. Biophysical studies have revealed two binding modes in the linker histone/nucleosome complex, the chromatosome, where the linker histone is either centered on or askew from the dyad axis. Each has been posited to have distinct effects on chromatin, however the molecular and thermodynamic mechanisms that drive them and their dependence on linker histone compositions remain poorly understood. We present molecular dynamics simulations of chromatosomes with the globular domain of two linker histone variants, generic H1 (genGH1) and H1.0 (GH1.0), to determine how their differences influence chromatosome structures, energetics, and dynamics. Results show that both unbound linker histones adopt a single compact conformation. Upon binding, DNA flexibility is reduced, resulting in increased chromatosome compaction. While both variants enthalpically favor on-dyad binding, energetic benefits are significantly higher for GH1.0, suggesting that GH1.0 is more capable than genGH1 of overcoming the large entropic reduction required for on-dyad binding which helps rationalize experiments that have consistently demonstrated GH1.0 in on-dyad states but that show genGH1 in both locations. These simulations highlight the thermodynamic basis for different linker histone binding motifs, and details their physical and chemical effects on chromatosomes.",

    "abstract": "For over a century, researchers have been trying to understand the relationship between embryogenesis and regeneration. A long-standing hypothesis is that biological processes implicated in embryonic development are re-deployed during regeneration. In the past decade, we have begun to understand the relationships of genes and their organization into gene regulatory networks (GRN) driving embryonic development and regeneration in diverse taxa.\n\nHere, we compare embryonic and regeneration GRNs in the same species to investigate how regeneration re-uses genetic interactions originally set aside for embryonic development. Using a well-suited embryonic development and whole-body regeneration model, the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, we show that at the transcriptomic level the regenerative program partially re-uses elements of the embryonic gene network along with a small cohort of genes that are specifically activated during the process of regeneration. We further identified co-expression modules that are either i) highly conserved between these two developmental trajectories and involved in core biological processes (e.g., terminal differentiation) or ii) regeneration specific modules that drive cellular events, such as apoptosis, that are unique to regeneration.\n\nOur global transcriptomic approach suggested that regeneration reactivates embryonic gene modules following regeneration-specific network logic. We thus verified this observation by functionally dissecting the role of MEK/ERK signaling during regeneration and established a first blueprint of the regeneration MEK/ERK-dependent GRN in Nematostella. Comparing the latter to the existing GRN underlying embryogenic development of the same species, we show at the network level that i) regeneration is a partial redeployment of the embryonic GRN, ii) embryonic gene modules are rewired during regeneration and iii) they are interconnected to novel down-stream targets, including \"regeneration-specific\" genes.\n\nSignificance statementIn this intra-species transcriptomic comparison of embryonic development and regeneration in a whole-body regeneration model, the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, we identified that 1) regeneration is a transcriptionally modest event compared to embryonic development and 2) that although regeneration re-uses embryonic genetic interactions, it does so by using regeneration specific network logic. In addition to identifying that apoptosis is a regeneration-specific event in Nematostella, this study reveals that GRN modules are reshuffled from one developmental trajectory to the other, even when accomplishing the same task (e.g. forming a fully functional organism). These findings highlight the plasticity of network architecture and set the basis for determining and functionally dissecting regeneration-inducing regulatory elements. From an evolutionary perspective, our study sets the foundation for further comparative work and provides new opportunities to understand why certain organisms can regenerate while others cannot.",

    "abstract": "Flagellated bacteria move collectively in a swirling pattern on agar surfaces immersed in a thin layer of viscous \\\"swarm fluid\\\", but the role of this fluid in mediating the cooperation of the bacterial population is not well understood. Herein, we use gold nanorods (AuNRs) as single particle tracers to explore the spatiotemporal structure of the swarm fluid. We observed that individual AuNRs are transported in a plane of ~2 m above the motile cells. They can travel for long distances (>700 m) in a 2D plane at high speed (often >50 m2/s) without interferences from bacterial movements. The particles are apparently lifted up and transported by collective mixing of the small vortices around bacteria during localized clustering and de-clustering of the motile cells, exhibiting superdiffusive and non-Gaussian characteristics with alternating large-step jumps and confined lingering. Their motions are consistent with the Levy walk (LW) model, revealing efficient transport flows above swarms. These flows provide obstacle-free highways for long-range material transportations, shed light on how swarming bacteria perform population-level communications, and reveal the essential role of the fluid phase on the emergence of large-scale synergy. This approach is promising for probing complex fluid dynamics and transports in other collective systems.",

Here we demonstrate that calculating nodal properties that are dependent on temporal community structure (such as the participation coefficient) in time-varying contexts can potentially lead to misleading results. Specifically, with regards to the participation coefficient, increases in integration can be inferred when the opposite is occuring. Further, we present a temporal extension to the participation coefficient measure (temporal participation coefficient) that circumnavigates this problem by jointly considering all community partitions assigned to a node through time. The proposed method allows us to track a nodes integration through time while adjusting for the possible changes in the community structure of the overall network.",

To circumvent the potential toxicity of SWI/SNF inhibition, we identified small molecules that inhibit the specific repressive function of these complexes but are relatively non-toxic and importantly synergize with ATR inhibitors in killing cancer cells. Our studies suggest an avenue for therapeutic enhancement of ATR/ATM inhibition and provide evidence for chemical synthetic lethality of BAF complexes as a therapeutic strategy in cancer.",

This versatile optics design provides control of 6 degrees of freedom of the illumination source (3 translation, 2 tilt, and beam shape) plus the axial position of the imaging plane. We also developed standalone software with an easy-to-use GUI to calibrate and control the microscope.
