    "abstract": "Tissue-specific reverse engineering of transcriptional networks has uncovered master regulators (MRs) of cellular networks in various cancers, yet the application of this method to neuropsychiatric disorders is largely unexplored. Here, using RNA-Seq data on postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) from schizophrenia (SCZ) patients and control subjects, we deconvolved the transcriptional network to identify MRs that mediate expression of a large body of target genes. Together with an independent RNA-Seq data on cultured cells derived from olfactory neuroepithelium, we identified TCF4, a leading SCZ risk locus implicated by genome-wide association studies, as one of the top candidate MRs that may be potentially dysregulated in SCZ. We validated the dysregulated TCF4-related transcriptional network through examining the transcription factor binding footprints inferred from human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neuronal ATAC-Seq data, as well as direct binding sites obtained from ChIP-seq data in SH-SY5Y cells. The predicted TCF4 transcriptional targets were enriched for genes showing transcriptomic changes upon knockdown of TCF4 in hiPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPC) and glutamatergic neurons (Glut_N), based on observations from three separate cell lines. The altered TCF4 gene network perturbations in NPC, as compared to that in Glut_N, was more similar to the expression differences in the TCF4 gene network observed in the DLPFC of individuals with SCZ. Moreover, TCF4-associated gene expression changes in NPC were more enriched than Glut_N for pathways involved in neuronal activity, genome-wide significant SCZ risk genes, and SCZ-associated de novo mutations. Our results suggest that TCF4 may potentially serve as a MR of a gene network that confers susceptibility to SCZ at early stage of neurodevelopment, highlighting the importance of network dysregulation involving core genes and many hundreds of peripheral genes in conferring susceptibility to neuropsychiatric diseases.",

    "abstract": "The WNT signaling network is comprised of multiple receptors that relay various input signals via distinct transduction pathways to execute multiple complex and context-specific output processes. Integrity of the WNT signaling network relies on proper specification between canonical and non-canonical pathways, which presents a regulatory challenge given that several signal transducing elements are shared between pathways. Here, we report that USP9X, a deubiquitylase, and WWP1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, interact physically to regulate a ubiquitin switch on DVL2, a WNT signaling protein. Our findings indicate that USP9X-mediated deubiquitylation of DVL2 is required for canonical WNT activation, while DVL2 ubiquitylation promotes its localization to actin-rich projections and increased cellular motility. We propose that a WWP1-USP9X axis regulates a ubiquitin switch on DVL2 that specifies its participation in either canonical WNT or WNT-PCP pathways. These findings have important implications for therapeutic targeting of USP9X in human cancer.",

In the current study, we investigated whether fluctuations in top-down control are related to creative thinking. Here, participants performed a  caption this task in which they had to provide an original and apt caption to accompany a presented picture, while EEG signals were recorded. To assess changing levels of top-down control, we made use of the strong relationship between mid frontal oscillatory activity in the theta range (4-7 HZ) and top-down control. Results demonstrate that specifically during the process of optimization and implementation of creative solutions, lower levels of mid frontal theta resulted in higher levels of creativity. In addition, increased creativity related to enhanced functional connectivity between occipital and mid frontal cortex. Together, our findings indicate that creativity benefits from a top-down induced shift towards an internally-oriented state during idea optimization and evaluation.",

    "abstract": "During the generation of rhythmic movements, most spinal neurons receive an oscillatory synaptic drive. The neuronal architecture underlying this drive is unknown, and the corresponding network size and sparseness have not yet been addressed. If the input originates from a small central pattern generator (CPG) with dense divergent connectivity, it will induce correlated input to all receiving neurons, while sparse convergent wiring will induce a weak correlation, if any. Here, we use pairwise recordings of spinal neurons to measure synaptic correlations and thus infer the wiring architecture qualitatively. A strong correlation on a slow timescale implies functional relatedness and a common source, which will also cause correlation on fast timescale due to shared synaptic connections. However, we consistently find marginal coupling between slow and fast correlations regardless of neuronal identity. This suggests either sparse convergent connectivity or a CPG network with recurrent inhibition that actively decorrelates common input.",

    "abstract": "The molecular function and fate of mRNAs are controlled by RNA binding proteins (RBPs). However, identification of the interacting proteome of a specific mRNA in vivo is still very challenging. Based on the widely-used RNA tagging with MS2 aptamers for RNA visualization, we developed a novel RNA proximity biotinylation (RNA-BioID) method by tethering biotin ligase (BirA*) via MS2 coat protein (MCP) at the 3UTR of endogenously MS2 tagged {beta}-actin mRNA in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). We demonstrate the dynamics of the {beta}-actin mRNA interactome by characterizing its changes upon serum-induced localization of the mRNA. Apart from the previously known interactors, we identified over 60 additional {beta}-actin associated RBPs by RNA-BioID, among them the KH-domain containing protein FUBP3/MARTA2 has shown to be required for {beta}-actin mRNA localization. This protein binds to the 3-untranslated region of {beta}-actin mRNA, is essential for {beta}-actin mRNA localization but does not interact with the characterized {beta}-actin zipcode element. RNA-BioID provides a tool to identify new mRNA interactors and to study the dynamic view of the interacting proteome of endogenous mRNAs in space and time.",

A single drug, praziquantel, is used to treat schistosome infection. Limitations in mass drug administration programs and the emergence of schistosomiasis in non-tropical areas indicate the need for new strategies to prevent infection. It has been known for several decades that rotifers colonizing the schistosomes snail intermediate host produce a water-soluble factor that paralyzes cercariae, the life-cycle stage infecting humans. In spite of its potential for preventing infection, the nature of this factor has remained obscure. Here, we report the purification and chemical characterization of Schistosome Paralysis Factor (SPF), a novel tetracyclic alkaloid produced by the rotifer Rotaria rotatoria. We show that this compound paralyzes schistosome cercariae and prevents infection, and does so more effectively than analogous compounds. This molecule provides new directions for understanding cercariae motility and new strategies for preventing schistosome infection.",

    "abstract": "Dendritic spines are small, bulbous protrusions along dendrites in neurons and play a critical role in synaptic transmission. Dendritic spines come in a variety of shapes that depend on their developmental state. Additionally, roughly 14-19% of mature spines have a specialized endoplasmic reticulum called the spine apparatus. How does the shape of a postsynaptic spine and its internal organization affect the spatio-temporal dynamics of short timescale signaling? Answers to this question are central to our understanding the initiation of synaptic transmission, learning, and memory formation. In this work, we investigated the effect of spine and spine apparatus size and shape on the spatio-temporal dynamics of second messengers using mathematical modeling using reaction-diffusion equations in idealized geometries (ellipsoids, spheres, and mushroom-shaped). Our analyses and simulations showed that in the short timescale, spine size and shape coupled with the spine apparatus geometries govern the spatiotemporal dynamics of second messengers. We show that the curvature of the geometries gives rise to pseudo-harmonic functions, which predict the locations of maximum and minimum concentrations along the spine head. Furthermore, we showed that the lifetime of the concentration gradient can be fine-tuned by localization of fluxes on the spine head and varying the relative curvatures and distances between the spine apparatus and the spine head. Thus, we have identified several key geometric determinants of how the spine head and spine apparatus may regulate the short timescale chemical dynamics of small molecules that control synaptic plasticity.",

Here we focused on flowering time, a trait of key importance for plant adaptation and life-cycle shifts. We undertook divergent selection experiments (Saclay DSEs) from two maize inbred lines. After 13 generations of selection, we obtained we obtained a time-lag of roughly two weeks between Early- and Late-populations. We used this material to characterize the genome-wide transcriptomic response to selection in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) before, during and after floral transition in realistic field conditions during two consecutive years. We validated the reliability of performing RNA-sequencing in uncontrolled conditions. We found that roughly half of maize genes were expressed in the SAM, 59.3% of which were differentially expressed. We detected a majority of genes with differential expression between inbreds and across meristem status, and retrieved a subset of 2,451 genes involved in the response to selection. Among these, we found a significant enrichment for genes with known function in maize flowering time. Furthermore, they were more often shared between inbreds than expected by chance, suggesting convergence of gene expression. We discuss new insights into the expression pattern of key players of the underlying gene regulatory network including ZCN8, RAP2.7, ZMM4, KN1, GA2ox1, as well as alternative scenarios for genetic convergence.",

    "abstract": "Centrins are EF-hand containing proteins ubiquitously found in eukaryotes and are key components of centrioles/basal bodies as well as certain contractile fibers. We previously identified three centrins in the human parasite Toxoplasma gondii, all of which localized to the centrioles. However, one of them, TgCentrin2 (CEN2), is also targeted to ring-shaped structures at the apical and basal ends of the parasite, as well as to multiple annuli at the junction between the apical cap and the rest of the membrane cortex. The role(s) that TgCentrin2 plays in these locations was unknown. Here we report the functional characterization of TgCentrin2 in the parasite lytic cycle. After multiple unsuccessful attempts to knock out or knock down the TgCentrin2 gene with existing tools, we designed a new conditional knockdown method that combines transcriptional and protein stability control to achieve tight regulation of TgCentrin2 levels in the parasite. We discovered that under knockdown conditions, there was an ordered loss of TgCentrin2 from its four compartments, due to differences in incorporation kinetics and structural inheritance over successive generations. This was correlated with the development of major invasion deficiency at early stages of CEN2 knockdown, and replication defects at later stages. These results indicate that TgCentrin2 is incorporated into multiple cytoskeletal structures to serve distinct functions in T. gondii that are required for parasite survival.",

To propagate they shed large parts of their body; to replace these lost tissues they regenerate proglottids (segments) as part of normal homeostasis. Their remarkable growth and regeneration are fueled by adult somatic stem cells that have yet to be characterized molecularly. Using the rat intestinal tapeworm, Hymenolepis diminuta, we find that regenerative potential is regionally limited to the neck, where head-dependent extrinsic signals create a permissive microenvironment for stem cell-driven regeneration. Using transcriptomic analyses and RNA interference, we characterize and functionally validate regulators of tapeworm growth and regeneration. We find no evidence that stem cells are restricted to the regeneration-competent neck. Instead, lethally irradiated tapeworms can be rescued when cells from either regeneration-competent or regeneration-incompetent regions are transplanted into the neck. Together, the head and neck tissues provide extrinsic cues that regulate stem cells, enabling region-specific regeneration in this parasite.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary graph theory models the effects of natural selection and random drift on structured populations of mutant and non-mutant individuals. Recent studies have shown that fixation times, which determine the rate of evolution, often have right-skewed distributions. Little is known, however, about how these distributions and their skew depend on mutant fitness. Here we calculate the fitness dependence of the fixation-time distribution for the Moran Birth-death process in populations modeled by two extreme networks: the complete graph and the one-dimensional ring lattice, each of which admits an exact solution in the limit of large network size. We find that with non-neutral fitness, the Moran process on the ring has normally distributed fixation times, independent of the relative fitness of mutants and non-mutants. In contrast, on the complete graph, the fixation-time distribution is a weighted convolution of two Gumbel distributions, with a weight depending on the relative fitness. When fitness is neutral, however, the Moran process has a highly skewed fixation-time distribution on both the complete graph and the ring. In this sense, the case of neutral fitness is singular. Even on these simple network structures, the fixation-time distribution exhibits rich fitness dependence, with discontinuities and regions of universality. Applications of our methods to a multi-fitness Moran model, times to partial fixation, and evolution on random networks are discussed.",

Artificial neural network such as convolution network (CNN) has reached human level performance in recognition tasks, however, animal neural system does not support such kernel scanning operation across retinal neurons, and thus the neuronal responses do not match that of CNN units. Here, we used an alternative recognition-reconstruction network (RRN) architecture as an analogy to animal-like system, and the resulting neural characteristics agreed fairly well with electrophysiological measurements in monkey studies. First, in network development study, the RRN also experienced critical developmental stages characterized by specificities in neuronal types, connectivity strength and firing pattern, from early stage of coarse salience map recognition to mature stage of fine structure recognition. In digit recognition study, we witnessed that the RRN could maintain object invariance representation under various viewing conditions by coordinated adjustment of responses of population neurons. And such concerted population responses contained untangled object identity and properties information that could be accurately extracted via a simple weighted summation decoder. In the learning and forgetting study, novel structure recognition was implemented by adjusting entire synapses in low magnitude while pattern specificities of original synaptic connectivity were preserved, which guaranteed a learning process without disrupting the existing functionalities.

    "abstract": "Unresolved inflammation is a significant predictor for developing chronic pain, and targeting the mechanisms underlying inflammation offers opportunities for therapeutic intervention. During inflammation, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity contributes to tissue remodeling and inflammatory signaling through proteolytic maturation of cytokines. MMP activity is regulated by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) 1-4. TIMP-1 and -2 have known roles in pain, but only in the context of MMP inhibition. However, TIMP-1 also has receptor-mediated cell signaling functions that are not well understood. Here, we examined how TIMP-1-dependent cell signaling impacted inflammatory hypersensitivity and ongoing pain. We found that hindpaw injection of complete Freunds adjuvant (CFA) increased keratinocyte-derived TIMP-1 that peaked 3 days following inflammation, when mechanical hypersensitivity began to emerge in WT mice. These data suggest that TIMP-1 expression inhibits the development of inflammatory hypersensitivity. To examine this possibility, we injected TIMP-1 knockout (T1KO) mice with a diluted CFA mixture to examine how subtle cutaneous inflammation affected behavioral hypersensitivity. T1KO mice exhibited rapid onset thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity at the site of inflammation that was absent or attenuated in WT controls. We also found that T1KO mice exhibited hypersensitivity in adjacent tissues innervated by different sets of afferents, and skin contralateral to the site of inflammation. Replacement of recombinant murine (rm)TIMP-1 alleviated hypersensitivity when administered at the site and time of inflammation. To examine the MMP-dependent and -independent mechanisms of rmTIMP-1, T1KO mice were administered full-length rmTIMP-1, the N-terminal region (TIMP-1(N)) with MMP-inhibitory properties, or the C-terminal region (TIMP-1(C)) that retains receptor signaling function. Each of the peptides prevented inflammatory hypersensitivity, suggesting that rmTIMP-1 acts through mechanisms that also include receptor-mediated cell signaling. We also found that hypersensitivity was neither due to genotype-specific differences in MMP-9 activity or expression, nor to differences in cytokine expression. Finally, to evaluate the potential clinical utility of TIMP-1, we administered rmTIMP-1 to WT mice and found that rmTIMP-1 prevented clonidine-induced conditioned place preference (e.g., ongoing pain) and inflammatory mechanical hypersensitivity. Collectively, our data suggest a novel role for TIMP-1 in the attenuation of inflammatory pain that occurs through previously uncharacterized cell signaling mechanisms.",

Using a standard PC and a 38-dipole coil, our solver computed the E-field in 84 coil positions per second in 20000 points on the cortex.\n\nConclusionThe presented methods enable real-time solving of the TMS-induced E-field in a realistic head model that contains the CSF. The new methodology allows more accurate targeting and precise adjustment of intensity during experimental or clinical TMS mapping.",

    "abstract": "RNA half-life is closely related to its cellular physiological function, so stability determinants may have regulatory functions. Micro(mi)RNAs have primarily been studied with respect to post-transcriptional mRNA regulation and target degradation. Here we study the impact of the tumor suppressive melanoma miRNA miR-211 on transcriptome stability and phenotype in the non-pigmented melanoma cell line, A375. Using 5-bromouridine IP chase (BRIC)-seq, transcriptome-wide RNA stability profiles revealed highly regulated genes and pathways important in this melanoma cell line. By combining BRIC-seq, RNA-seq and in silico predictions, we identified both existing and novel direct miR-211 targets. We validated DUSP3 as one such novel miR-211 target, which itself sustains colony formation and invasion in A375 cells via MAPK/PI3K signaling. miRNAs have the capacity to control RNA turnover as a gene expression mechanism, and RNA stability profiling is an excellent tool for interrogating functionally relevant gene regulatory pathways and miRNA targets when combined with other high-throughput and in silico approaches.",

    "abstract": "A period of holding still follows every movement. It has been assumed that for the arm, moving and holding are functionally independent: movement is via an adaptive, feedback-dependent controller that generates commands to transport the arm, while holding is via setting of reflexes that produce a postural field at movement endpoint. This assumption predicts that commands that move the arm should not affect the postural field at movement termination. Surprisingly, we found that as the reach commands changed, so did the ensuing postural field. The postural commands depended on mathematical integration of the reach commands. Following damage to the corticospinal tract, despite severe reach impairments, the holding system faithfully integrated the imperfect reach commands on a trial-by-trial basis. Together, these findings suggest that holding the arm still is accomplished via a separate, likely subcortical structure that acts as a mathematical integrator of the commands generated by the cortical reach controller.",

The difference between brain age and actual age (the \"delta\") is typically computed, reflecting deviation from the population norm. This therefore may reflect accelerated aging (positive delta) or resilience (negative delta) and has been found to be a useful correlate with factors such as disease and cognitive decline. However, although there has been a range of methods proposed for estimating brain age, there has been little study of the optimal ways of computing the delta. In this technical note we describe problems with the most common current approach, and present potential improvements. We evaluate different estimation methods on simulated and real data. We also find the strongest correlations of corrected brain age delta with 5,792 non-imaging variables (non-brain physical measures, life-factor measures, cognitive test scores, etc.), and also with 2,641 multimodal brain imaging-derived phenotypes, with data from 19,000 participants in UK Biobank.",

Increasing evidence suggests that targeting both integrins simultaneously with antagonists is more effective in cancer therapy because of concerns about resistance and paradoxical promotion of tumor growth with use of agents highly selective for a single integrin. Engineered Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-containing 3.5 kDa cysteine-knot proteins (knottins 2.5F and 2.5D) are attractive drug candidates due to their exceptional structural stability and high affinity binding to certain integrins. 2.5F binds both V{beta}3 and 5{beta}1, whereas 2.5D is V{beta}3-selective. To elucidate the structural basis of integrin selection, we determined the structures of 2.5F and 2.5D both as apo-proteins and in complex with V{beta}3. These data, combined with MD simulations and mutational studies, revealed a critical role of two V{beta}3-specific residues in the vicinity of the metal ion dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) in promoting an V{beta}3-induced fit of 2.5D. In contrast, conformational selection accounted for the specificity of 2.5F to both integrins. These data provide new insights into the structural basis of integrin-ligand binding specificity, and could help in development of integrin-targeted therapeutics.",

Such phase maintenance requires adjustment of synaptic input with network frequency, a relationship that we explored using the crab, Cancer borealis, pyloric network. The burst phase of pyloric neurons is relatively constant despite a >2-fold variation in network frequency. We used noise input to characterize how input shape influences burst delay of a pyloric neuron, and then used dynamic clamp to examine how burst phase depends on the period, amplitude, duration, and shape of rhythmic synaptic input. Phase constancy across a range of periods required a proportional increase of synaptic duration with period. However, phase maintenance was also promoted by an increase of amplitude and peak phase of synaptic input with period. Mathematical analysis shows how short-term synaptic plasticity can coordinately change amplitude and peak phase to maximize the range of periods over which phase constancy is achieved.",

    "abstract": "Pyridox(am)ine 5-phosphate oxidase (PNPO) is a rate-limiting enzyme in converting dietary vitamin B6 (VB6) to pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP), the biologically active form of VB6, and involved in the synthesis of neuro-transmitters including GABA, dopamine, and serotonin. In humans, PNPO mutations have been increasingly identified in neonatal epileptic encephalopathy and more recently also in early-onset epilepsy. Till now, little is known about the neurobiological mechanisms underlying PNPO-deficiency-induced seizures due to the lack of animal models. Previously we identified a c.95 C > A missense mutation in sgll - the Drosophila homolog of human PNPO (hPNPO) and found mutant (sgll95) flies exhibiting a lethal phenotype on a diet devoid of VB6. Here we report the establishment of both sgll95 and ubiquitous sgll knockdown (KD) flies as valid animal models of PNPO-deficiency-induced epilepsy. Both sgll95 and sgll KD flies exhibit spontaneous seizures before they die. Electrophysiological recordings reveal that seizures caused by PNPO deficiency have characteristics similar to that in flies treated with GABA antagonist picrotoxin. Both seizures and lethality are associated with low PLP levels and can be rescued by ubiquitous expression of wild-type sgll or hPNPO, suggesting the functional conservation of the PNPO enzyme between humans and flies. Results from cell type-specific sgll KD further demonstrate that PNPO in the brain is necessary for seizure prevention and survival. Our establishment of the first animal model of PNPO deficiency will lead to better understanding of VB6 biology, the PNPO gene and its mutations discovered in patients, and can be a cost-effective system to test therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Attentive motion tracking deficits, measured using multiple object tracking (MOT) tasks, have been identified in a number of visual and neurodevelopmental disorders such as amblyopia and autism. These deficits are often attributed to the abnormal development of high-level attentional networks. However, neuroimaging evidence from amblyopia suggests that reduced MOT performance can be explained by impaired function in motion sensitive area MT+ alone. To test the hypothesis that MT+ plays an important role in MOT, we assessed whether modulation of MT+ activity using continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) influenced MOT performance in participants with normal vision. An additional experiment involving numerosity judgements of MOT stimulus elements was conducted to control for non-specific effects of MT+ cTBS on psychophysical task performance. The MOT stimulus consisted of 4 target and 4 distractor dots and was presented at 10{degrees} eccentricity in the right or left hemifield. Functional MRI-guided cTBS was applied to left MT+. Participants (n = 13, age:27 {+/-} 3) attended separate active and sham cTBS sessions where the MOT task was completed before, 5 mins post and 30 mins post cTBS. Active cTBS significantly impaired MOT task accuracy relative to baseline for the right (stimulated) hemifield 5 mins (10 {+/-} 2% reduction; t12 = 1.95, p = 0.03) and 30 mins (14 {+/-} 3% reduction; t12 = 2.96, p = 0.01) post stimulation. No impairment occurred within the left (control) hemifield after active cTBS or for either hemifield after sham cTBS. Numerosity task performance was unaffected by cTBS. These results highlight the importance of lower-level motion processing for MOT and suggest that abnormal function of MT+ alone is sufficient to cause a deficit in MOT task performance.",

Bibliometric analyses suggest that random field theory (RFT)-based voxel- and cluster-level fMRI inference are the most commonly used approaches for the statistical evaluation of task-related fMRI data. However, general power and sample size calculations for these inference approaches remain elusive. Based on the mathematical theory of RFT-based inference, we here develop power and positive predictive value (PPV) functions for voxel- and cluster-level inference in both uncorrected single test and corrected multiple testing scenarios. Moreover, we apply the theoretical results to evaluate the sample size necessary to achieve desired power and PPV levels based on an fMRI pilot study.",

These \\\"lapses\\\" are treated as a nuisance arising from noise tangential to the decision, e.g. inattention or motor errors. Here, we use a multisensory decision task in rats to demonstrate that these explanations cannot account for lapses stimulus dependence. We propose a novel explanation: lapses reflect a strategic trade-off between exploiting known rewarding actions and exploring uncertain ones. We tested the models predictions by selectively manipulating one actions reward magnitude or probability. As uniquely predicted by this model, changes were restricted to lapses associated with that action. Finally, we show that lapses are a powerful tool for assigning decision-related computations to neural structures based on disruption experiments (here, posterior striatum and secondary motor cortex). These results suggest that lapses reflect an integral component of decision-making and are informative about action values in normal and disrupted brain states.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSexual activity during youth is common in Lao PDR. However, young people seldom utilize sexual and reproductive health services and subsequently suffer from poor sexual and reproductive health. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore the barriers perceived by youth that prevent their access to sexual and reproductive health services.\\n\\nMethodsTwenty-nine semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 participants aged 15-25 years, from urban and rural areas. A vignette was used during interviews with those who had no experience with sexual and reproductive health services. Additionally, seven semi-structured interviews were conducted with health providers from youth-friendly health clinics and from public sexual and reproductive health services. Data were analyzed using a thematic approach.\\n\\nResultsThe main barriers preventing young people from accessing sexual and reproductive health services were related to cognitive accessibility and psychosocial accessibility. The cognitive accessibility barriers were a lack of sexual knowledge and a lack of awareness of services. Perceived barriers in psychosocial accessibility were the feelings of shyness and shame caused by negative cultural attitudes to premarital sex, and the fear of parents finding out about visits to public sexual and reproductive health services, due to lack of confidentiality in the services and among health providers. In addition, the barriers of geographical accessibility, mainly insufficient availability of youth-friendly health clinics.\\n\\nConclusionTo improve access to services, a multi-component strategy is needed: promotion of youth-friendly health clinics; sexual education in schools; a formal referral system between schools and youth-friendly health clinics; and community support interventions. Prior to implementation, more research should be done on the applicability of these methods in the Laos context. Future research should try to determine the cost-effectiveness of youth-friendly health clinics integrated in a district hospital and stand-alone clinics, to provide insight into which form should be further developed.",
