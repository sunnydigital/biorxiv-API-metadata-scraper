    "abstract": "The neutral theory has been used as a null model for interpreting nature and produced the Recent Out of Africa model of anatomically modern humans. Recent studies, however, have established that genetic diversities are mostly at maximum saturation levels maintained by selection, therefore challenging the explanatory power of the neutral theory and rendering the present molecular model of human origins untenable. Using improved methods and public data, we have revisited human evolution and found sharing of genetic variations among racial groups to be largely a result of parallel mutations rather than recent common ancestry and admixture as commonly assumed. We derived an age of 1.86-1.92 million years for the first split in modern human populations based on autosomal diversity data. We found evidence of modern Y and mtDNA originating in East Asia and dispersing via hybridization with archaic humans. Analyses of autosomes, Y and mtDNA all suggest that Denisovan and Neanderthal were archaic Africans with Eurasian admixtures and ancestors of South Asia Negritos and Aboriginal Australians. Verifying our model, we found more ancestry of Southern Chinese from Hunan in Africans relative to other East Asian groups examined. These results suggest multiregional evolution of autosomes and replacements of archaic Y and mtDNA by modern ones originating in East Asia, thereby leading to a coherent account of modern human origins.",

    "abstract": "Plants synthesize hundreds of thousands of ecologically specialized, lineage-specific metabolites through biosynthetic gene duplication and functional specialization. However, the rewiring of duplicated genes into existing regulatory networks remains unclear. We show that the duplicated gene CYP82C2 was recruited into the WRKY33 regulon and indole-3-carbonylnitrile (ICN) biosynthetic pathway through exaptation of a retroduplicated LINE retrotransposon (EPCOT3) into a novel enhancer. The stepwise development of a chromatin-accessible WRKY33-binding site on EPCOT3 potentiated the regulatory neofunctionalization of CYP82C2 and the evolution of inducible defense metabolite 4-hydroxy-ICN in Arabidopsis thaliana. Transposable elements (TEs) have long been recognized to have the potential to rewire regulatory networks; these results establish a more complete understanding of how duplicated genes and TEs contribute in concert to chemical diversity and pathogen defense.",

    "abstract": "Rhinovirus infections are linked to the development and exacerbation of allergic diseases including allergic asthma. IgE, another contributor to atopic disease pathogenesis, has been shown to regulate dendritic cell antiviral functions and influence T cell priming by monocytes. We previously demonstrated that IgE-mediated stimulation of monocytes alters multiple cellular functions including cytokine secretion, phagocytosis, and influenza-induced Th1 priming. In this study, we investigate the effects of IgE-mediated allergic stimulation on monocyte-driven, RV-induced T cell priming utilizing primary human monocyte-T cell co-cultures. We demonstrate that IgE crosslinking of RV-exposed monocytes enhances monocyte-driven Th2 priming. This increase in RV-induced Th2 differentiation was regulated by IgE-mediated inhibition of type I interferon and induction of IL-10. These findings suggest an additional mechanism by which two clinically significant risk factors for allergic disease exacerbations - IgE-mediated stimulation and rhinovirus infection, may synergistically promote Th2 differentiation and allergic inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Serial dependence, how recent experiences bias our current estimations, has been described experimentally during delayed-estimation of many different visual features, with subjects tending to make estimates biased towards previous ones. It has been proposed that these attractive biases help perception stabilization in the face of correlated natural scene statistics as an adaptive mechanism, although this remains mostly theoretical. Color, which is strongly correlated in natural scenes, has never been studied with regard to its serial dependencies. Here, we found significant serial dependence in 6 out of 7 datasets with behavioral data of humans (total n=111) performing delayed-estimation of color with uncorrelated sequential stimuli. Consistent with a drifting memory model, serial dependence was stronger when referenced relative to previous report, rather than to previous stimulus. In addition, it built up through the experimental session, suggesting metaplastic mechanisms operating at a slower time scale than previously proposed (e.g. short-term synaptic facilitation). Because, in contrast with natural scenes, stimuli were temporally uncorrelated, this build-up casts doubt on serial dependencies being an ongoing adaptation to the stable statistics of the environment.",

    "abstract": "The growth rate of single bacterial cells is continuously disturbed by random fluctuations in biosynthesis rates and by deterministic cell-cycle events, such as division, genome duplication, and septum formation. It is not understood whether, and how, bacteria reject these disturbances. Here we quantified growth and constitutive protein expression dynamics of single Bacillus subtilis cells, as a function of cell-cycle-progression. Variation in birth size and growth rate, resulting from unequal cell division, is largely compensated for when cells divide again. We analysed the cell-cycle-dynamics of these compensations and found that both growth and protein expression exhibited biphasic behaviour. During a first phase of variable duration, the absolute rates were approximately constant and cells behaved as sizers. In the second phase, rates increased and growth behaviour exhibited characteristics of a timer-strategy. This work shows how cell-cycle-dependent rate adjustments of biosynthesis and growth are integrated to compensate for physio-logical disturbances caused by cell division.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEUnder constant conditions, bacterial populations can maintain a fixed average cell size and constant exponential growth rate. At the single cell-level, however, cell-division can cause significant physiological perturbations, requiring compensatory mechanisms to restore the growth-related characteristics of individual cells toward that of the average cell. Currently, there is still a major gap in our understanding of the dynamics of these mechanisms, i.e. how adjustments in growth, metabolism and biosynthesis are integrated during the bacterial cell-cycle to compensate the disturbances caused by cell division. Here we quantify growth and constitutive protein expression in individual bacterial cells at sub-cell-cycle resolution. Significantly, both growth and protein production rates display structured and coordinated cell-cycle-dependent dynamics. These patterns reveal the dynamics of growth rate and size compensations during cell-cycle progression. Our findings provide a dynamic cell-cycle perspective that offers novel avenues for the interpretation of physiological processes that underlie cellular homeostasis in bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging has seen a paradigm shift from a formal description of local activity patterns toward studying distributed brain networks. The recently defined framework of the  human connectome allows to globally analyse parts of the brain and their interconnections. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an invasive therapy for patients with severe movement disorders aiming to retune abnormal brain network activity by local high frequency stimulation of the basal ganglia. Beyond clinical utility, DBS represents a powerful research platform to study functional connectomics and the modulation of distributed brain networks in the human brain. We acquired resting-state functional MRI in twenty Parkinsons disease (PD) patients with subthalamic DBS switched ON and OFF. An age-matched control cohort of fifteen subjects was acquired from an open data repository. DBS lead placement in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) was localized using a state-of-the art pipeline that involved brain shift correction, multispectral image registration and use of a precise subcortical atlas. Based on a realistic 3D model of the electrode and surrounding anatomy, the amount of local impact of DBS was estimated using a finite element method approach. On a global level, average connectivity increases and decreases throughout the brain were estimated by contrasting ON and OFF DBS scans on a voxel-wise graph comprising eight thousand nodes. Local impact of DBS on the sensorimotor STN explained half the variance in global connectivity increases within the sensorimotor network (R = 0.711, p < 0.001). Moreover, local impact of DBS on the motor STN could explain the degree of how much voxel-wise average brain connectivity normalized toward healthy controls (R = 0.713, p < 0.001). Finally, a network based statistics analysis revealed that DBS attenuated specific couplings that are known to be pathological in PD. Namely, coupling between motor thalamus and sensorimotor cortex was increased and striatal coupling with cerebellum, external pallidum and STN was decreased by DBS.\n\nOur results show that rs-fMRI may be acquired in DBS ON and OFF conditions on clinical MRI hardware and that data is useful to gain additional insight into how DBS modulates the functional connectome of the human brain. We demonstrate that effective DBS increases overall connectivity in the motor network, normalizes the network profile toward healthy controls and specifically strengthens thalamo-cortical connectivity while reducing striatal control over basal ganglia and cerebellar structures.",

    "abstract": "Black Aspergilli are, the most causes of aspergillosis and Aspergillus niger and A. tubingensis are two more frequently isolates. Although, amphotericin B was a gold standard for the treatment of invasive fungal infection for several decades, it replaced by several new antifungals. Furthermore, a novel antifungal, luliconazole, appears to offer the potential for improved therapy for aspergillosis. The aim of the present study was to compare the effect of a novel antifungal agent, luliconazole, with classical antifungal against clinical and environmental strains of black Aspergilli. Sixty seven strains of black Aspergilli were identified using morphological and molecular tests ({beta}-Tubulin gene). Antifungal susceptibility test was applied according to CLSI M38 A2. The results were reported as MIC range, MIC50, MIC90 and MICGM. In the present study, A. niger was the common isolate followed by, A. tubingensis and 54.1% (clinical) and 30% (environmental) of isolates were resistant to caspofungin. The highest resistant rate was found in amphotericin B for both clinical (86.5%) and environmental (96.7%) strains. Clinical strains of Aspergillus were more sensitive to voriconazole (86.7%) than environmental strains (70.3%). On the other hand, 83.8% of clinical and 70% of environmental isolates were resistant to posaconazole, respectively. It is found that the lowest MIC range, MIC50, MIC90, and MICGM was attributed to luliconazole in clinical strains. In conclusion, luliconazole vs. routine antifungal is a potent antifungal for A. niger complex in vitro. The MIC range, MIC50, MIC90 and MICGM of luliconazole against black Aspergilli were the lowest among the representative tested antifungals.",

    "abstract": "Essential tremor is the most prevalent movement disorder and is often refractory to medical treatment. Deep brain stimulation offers a therapeutic approach that can efficiently control tremor symptoms. Several deep brain stimulation targets (ventral intermediate nucleus, zona incerta, posterior subthalamic area) have been discussed for tremor treatment. Effective deep brain stimulation therapy for tremor critically involves optimal targeting to modulate the tremor network. This could potentially become more robust and precise by using state-of-the-art brain connectivity measurements. In the current study, we utilized two normative brain connectomes (structural and functional) to show the pattern of effective deep brain stimulation electrode connectivity in 36 essential tremor patients. Our structural and functional connectivity models were significantly predictive of post-operative tremor improvement in out-of-sample data (p < 0.001 for both structural and functional leave-one-out cross-validation). Additionally, we segregated the somatotopic brain network based on head and hand tremor scores. These resulted in segregations that mapped onto the well-known somatotopic maps of both motor cortex and cerebellum. Crucially, this shows that slightly distinct networks need to be modulated to ameliorate head vs. hand tremor and that those networks could be identified based on somatotopic zones in motor cortex and cerebellum.\\n\\nFinally, we propose a multi-modal connectomic deep brain stimulation sweet spot that may serve as a reference to enhance clinical care, in the future. This spot resided in the posterior subthalamic area, encroaching on the inferior borders of ventral intermediate nucleus and sensory thalamus. Our results underscore the importance of integrating brain connectivity in optimizing deep brain stimulation targeting for essential tremor.",

    "abstract": "A cerebral stroke is characterized by compromised brain function due to an interruption in cerebrovascular blood supply. Although stroke incurs focal damage determined by the vascular territory affected, clinical symptoms commonly involve multiple functions and cognitive faculties that are insufficiently explained by the focal damage alone. Functional connectivity (FC) refers to the synchronous activity between spatially remote brain regions organized in a network of interconnected brain regions. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has advanced this system-level understanding of brain function, elucidating the complexity of stroke outcomes, as well as providing information useful for prognostic and rehabilitation purposes.\\n\\nWe tested for differences in brain network connectivity between a group of patients with minor ischemic strokes in sub-acute phase (n=44) and matched controls (n=100). As neural network configuration is dependent on cognitive effort, we obtained fMRI data during rest and two load levels of a multiple object tacking (MOT) task. Network nodes and time-series were estimated using independent component analysis (ICA) and dual regression, with network edges defined as the partial temporal correlations between node pairs. The full set of edgewise FC went into a cross-validated regularized linear discriminant analysis (rLDA) to classify groups and cognitive load.\\n\\nMOT task performance and cognitive tests revealed no significant group differences. While multivariate machine learning revealed high sensitivity to experimental condition, with classification accuracies between rest and attentive tracking approaching 100%, group classification was at chance level, with negligible differences between conditions. Repeated measures ANOVA showed significantly stronger synchronization between a temporal node and a sensorimotor node in patients across conditions. Overall, the results revealed high sensitivity of FC indices to task conditions, and suggest relatively small brain network-level disturbances after clinically mild strokes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe first step in understanding ecological community diversity and dynamics is quantifying community membership. An increasingly common method for doing so is through metagenomics. Because of the rapidly increasing popularity of this approach, a large number of computational tools and pipelines are available for analysing metagenomic data. However, the majority of these tools have been designed and benchmarked using highly accurate short read data (i.e. illumina), with few studies benchmarking classification accuracy for long error-prone reads (PacBio or Oxford Nanopore). In addition, few tools have been benchmarked for non-microbial communities.\\n\\nResultsHere we use simulated error prone Oxford Nanopore and high accuracy Illumina read sets to systematically investigate the effects of sequence length and taxon type on classification accuracy for metagenomic data from both microbial and non-microbial communities. We show that very generally, classification accuracy is far lower for non-microbial communities, even at low taxonomic resolution (e.g. family rather than genus).\\n\\nConclusionsWe then show that for two popular taxonomic classifiers, long error-prone reads can significantly increase classification accuracy, and this is most pronounced for non-microbial communities. This work provides insight on the expected accuracy for metagenomic analyses for different taxonomic groups, and establishes the point at which read length becomes more important than error rate for assigning the correct taxon.",

    "abstract": "Despite resting state networks being associated with a variety of cognitive abilities, it remains unclear how these local areas act in concert to express particular cognitive operations. Theoretical and empirical accounts indicate that large-scale resting state networks reconcile dual tendencies toward integration and segregation by operating in a metastable regime of their coordination dynamics. One proposal is that metastability confers important behavioural qualities by dynamically binding distributed local areas into large-scale neurocognitive entities. We tested this hypothesis by analysing fMRI data in a large cohort of healthy individuals (N=566) and comparing the metastability of the brains large-scale resting network architecture at rest and during the performance of several tasks. Task-based reasoning was principally characterised by high metastability in cognitive control networks and low metastability in sensory processing areas. Although metastability between resting state networks increased during task performance, cognitive ability was more closely linked to spontaneous activity. High metastability in the intrinsic connectivity of cognitive control networks was linked to novel problem solving (or fluid intelligence) but was less important in tasks relying on prior experience (or crystallised intelligence). Crucially, subjects with resting architectures similar or  pre-configured to a task-general arrangement demonstrated superior cognitive performance. Taken together, our findings support a critical linkage between the spontaneous metastability of the large-scale networks of the cerebral cortex and cognition.",

    "abstract": "The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate yielding acetyl-CoA and CO2. The PDHC-deficient Corynebacterium glutamicum strain {Delta}aceE is therefore lacking an important decarboxylation step in central metabolism. Additional inactivation of pyc, encoding pyruvate carboxylase, resulted in a >15 hour lag phase in the presence of glucose, while no growth defect was observed on gluconeogenetic substrates like acetate. Growth was successfully restored by deletion of ptsG encoding the glucose-specific permease of the PTS system, thereby linking the observed phenotype to the increased sensitivity of strain {Delta}aceE {Delta}pyc to glucose catabolism. In the following, strain {Delta}aceE {Delta}pyc was used to systematically study the impact of perturbations of the intracellular CO2/HCO3- pool on growth and anaplerotic flux. Remarkably, all measures leading to enhanced CO2/HCO3- levels, such as external addition of HCO3-, increasing the pH, or rerouting metabolic flux via pentose phosphate pathway, at least partially eliminated the lag phase of strain {Delta}aceE {Delta}pyc on glucose medium. In accordance, inactivation of the urease enzyme, lowering the intracellular CO2/HCO3- pool, led to an even longer lag phase accompanied with the excretion of L-valine and L-alanine. Transcriptome analysis as well as an adaptive laboratory evolution experiment of strain {Delta}aceE {Delta}pyc revealed the reduction of glucose uptake as a key adaptive measure to enhance growth on glucose/acetate mixtures. Altogether, our results highlight the significant impact of the intracellular CO2/HCO3- pool on metabolic flux distribution, which becomes especially evident in engineered strains suffering from low endogenous CO2 production rates as exemplified by PDHC-deficient strains.\\n\\nImportanceCO2 is a ubiquitous product of cellular metabolism and an essential substrate for carboxylation reactions. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) catalyzes a central metabolic reaction contributing to the intracellular CO2/HCO3- pool in many organisms. In this study, we used a PDHC-deficient strain of Corynebacterium glutamicum, which was additionally lacking pyruvate carboxylase ({Delta}aceE {Delta}pyc). This strain featured a >15 h lag phase during growth on glucose-acetate mixtures. We used this strain to systematically assess the impact of alterations in the intracellular CO2/HCO3- pool on growth on glucose-containing medium. Remarkably, all measures enhancing the CO2/HCO3- levels successfully restored growth emphasizing the strong impact of the intracellular CO2/HCO3- pool on metabolic flux especially in strains suffering from low endogenous CO2 production rates.",

    "abstract": "We addressed the onset of synergistic activity of the two well-studied antimicrobial peptides magainin 2 (MG2a) and PGLa using lipid-only mimics of Gram-negative cytoplasmic membranes. Specifically, we coupled a joint analysis of small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering experiments on fully hydrated lipid vesicles in the presence of MG2a and L18W-PGLa to all-atom and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. In agreement with previous studies both peptides, as well as their equimolar mixture, were found to remain in a surface-aligned topology upon membrane insertion and to induce significant membrane perturbation as evidenced by membrane thinning and hydrocarbon order parameter changes in the vicinity of the inserted peptide. These effects were particularly pronounced for the so called synergistic mixture of 1:1 (mol/mol) L18W-PGLa/MG2a and cannot be accounted for by a linear combination of the membrane perturbations of two peptides individually. Our data are consistent with parallel heterodimers forming at much lower concentrations than previously considered, but which do not induce a synergistic leakage of dyes. Our simulations further show that the heterodimers interact via salt bridges and hydrophobic forces, which apparently makes them more stable than putatively formed antiparallel L18W-PGLa and MG2a homodimers. Moreover, dimerization of L18W-PGLa and MG2a leads to a relocation of the peptides within the lipid headgroup regime as compared to the individual peptides. The early onset of dimerization of L18W-PGLa and MG2a at low peptide concentrations consequently appears to be key to their synergistic dye-releasing activity from lipid vesicles at high concentrations.\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEWe demonstrate that specific interactions of the antimicrobial peptides MG2a and PGLa with each other in POPE/POPG bilayers lead to the formation of surface-aligned parallel dimers, which provide already at low peptide concentrations the nucleus for the peptides well-known synergistic activity.",

    "abstract": "Microbes face intense competition in the natural world, and so need to wisely allocate their resources to multiple functions, in particular to metabolism. Understanding competition among metabolic strategies that are subject to trade-offs is therefore crucial for deeper insight into the competition, cooperation, and community assembly of microorganisms. In this work, we evaluate competing metabolic strategies within an ecological context by considering not only how the environment influences cell growth, but also how microbes shape their chemical environment. Utilizing chemostat-based resource-competition models, we exhibit a set of intuitive and general procedures for assessing metabolic strategies. Using this framework, we are able to relate and unify multiple metabolic models, and to demonstrate how the fitness landscape of strategies becomes intrinsically dynamic due to species-environment feedback. Such dynamic fitness landscapes produce rich behaviors, and prove to be crucial for ecological and evolutionary stable coexistence in all the models we examined.",

Unfortunately, in rapidly-growing fields like neuroscience, this is becoming increasingly untenable, even for the most conscientious scientists. Thus the merits and limitations of existing models, or whether a new model is an improvement on the state-of-the-art, is often unclear.\\n\\nSoftware engineers seeking to verify, validate and contribute to a complex software project rely on suites of simple executable tests, called \\\"unit tests\\\". Drawing inspiration from this practice, we previously developed SciUnit, an easy-to-use framework for developing data-driven \\\"model validation tests\\\" - executable functions, here written in Python. Each such test generates and statistically validates predictions from a model against one relevant feature of empirical data to produce a score indicating agreement between the model and the data. Suites of such validation tests can be used to clearly identify the merits and limitations of existing models and developmental progress on new models.\\n\\nHere we describe NeuronUnit, a library that builds upon SciUnit and integrates with several existing neuroinformatics resources to support the validation of single-neuron models using data gathered by neurophysiologists and neuroanatomists.

    "abstract": "Mucus clearance constitutes the primary defence of the respiratory system against viruses, bacteria and environmental insults [1]. This transport across the entire airway emerges from the integrated activity of thousands of multiciliated cells, each containing hundreds of cilia, which together must coordinate their spatial arrangement, alignment and motility [2, 3]. The mechanisms of fluid transport have been studied extensively at the level of an individual cilium [4, 5], collectively moving metachronal waves [6-10], and more generally the hydrodynamics of active matter [11, 12]. However, the connection between local cilia architecture and the topology of the flows they generate remains largely unexplored. Here, we image the mouse airway from the sub-cellular (nm) to the organ scales (mm), characterising quantitatively its ciliary arrangement and the generated flows. Locally we measure heterogeneity in both cilia organisation and flow structure, but across the trachea fluid transport is coherent. To examine this result, a hydrodynamic model was developed for a systematic exploration of different tissue architectures. Surprisingly, we find that disorder enhances particle clearance, whether it originates from fluctuations, heterogeneity in multiciliated cell arrangement or ciliary misalignment. This resembles elements of  stochastic resonance [13-15] in a self-assembled biological system. Taken together, our results shed light on how the microstructure of an active carpet [16, 17] determines its emergent dynamics. Furthermore, this work is also directly applicable to human airway pathologies [1], which are the third leading cause of deaths worldwide [18].",

    "abstract": "Global biodiversity is declining at rates faster than at any other point in human history. Experimental manipulations of biodiversity at small spatial scales have demonstrated that communities with fewer species consistently produce less biomass than higher diversity communities. However, understanding how the global extinction crisis is likely to impact global ecosystem functioning will require applying these local and largely experimental findings to natural systems at substantially larger spatial and temporal scales. Here we propose that we can use two simple macroecological patterns - the species area curve and the biomass-area curve - to upscale the species richness-biomass relationship. We demonstrate that at local spatial scales, each additional species will contribute more to biomass production with increasing area sampled because the species-area curve saturates and the biomass-area curve increases monotonically. We use species-area and biomass-area curves from a Minnesota grassland and a Panamanian tropical dry forest to examine the species richness - biomass relationship at three and ten sampling extents, respectively. In both datasets, the observed relationship between biodiversity and biomass production at every sampling extent was predicted from simple species-area and biomass-area relationships. These findings suggest that macroecological patterns like the species-area curve underpin the scaling of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research and can be used to predict these relationships at the global scales where they are relevant for species loss.",

    "abstract": "Nanopores, both protein and solid-state, are explored as single molecule analytical tools, but using an experimental platform is challenging. Here we show that a commercially available nanopore device, MinION from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), successfully accomplishes a task challenging for a conventional analytical tool. Specifically the MinION discriminates among 31 nucleotide (nt) long oligoriboadenylates with a single pyrimidine (Py) substitution, when this pyrimidine is tagged/labeled with a bulky group (Osmium tetroxide 2,2-bipyridine or OsBp). This platform also discriminates between an osmylated Py (Py-OsBp) followed by a purine (Pu) and a Py-OsBp followed by a second Py-OsBp, leading to the conjecture that the bulky tag enables sensing of a two-nucleotide sequence. Two-nucleotide sensing could greatly improve base-calling accuracy in motor enzyme-assisted nanopore sequencing.\\n\\nWe attribute the observed discrimination neither to the specific pore protein nor to OsBp, but to the tags bulkiness, that leads to markedly slower translocation and \\\"touching\\\" proximity at the pores constriction zone, that forces desolvation and reorganization, and enables strong interactions among the nanopore, the tagged pyrimidine, and the adjacent nucleobase. These results constitute proof-of-principle that size-suitable nanopores may be superior to traditional analytical tools, for the characterization of RNA oligos and microRNAs enhanced by selective labelling.",

We combined these candidate biomarkers into a single ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method and optimized it, prioritizing simplicity of sample preparation and time needed for analysis, enabling high-throughput analysis in clinical laboratory settings.\\n\\nResultsWe validated the method in terms of limit of (a) detection (LOD), (b) limit of quantitation (LOQ), (c) linearity (R2), (d) linear range, and (e) intra- and inter-day repeatability of each metabolite. The methods performance was demonstrated in the analysis of selected samples from a diabetes cohort study. Metabolite levels were associated with clinical measurements and kidney complications in type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients. Specifically, both amino acids and amino acid-related analytes were associated with macro-albuminuria.

To explore the functional behavior and dynamics of individual NSCs within brain germinal pools, we combined genetic lineage tracing, quantitative clonal analysis, intravital imaging and global population assessments in the adult zebrafish telencephalon. We show that adult neurogenesis is organized in a hierarchy where a subpopulation of reservoir NSCs with longterm self-renewal potential generate a pool of operational NSCs taking stochastic fates biased towards neuronal differentiation. To fuel the long-term growth of the adult germinal niche, we provide evidence for the existence of an additional, upstream, progenitor population that supports the continuous generation of new reservoir NSCs, contributing to their overall expansion. Hence, the dynamics of vertebrate neurogenesis relies on a hierarchical organization where growth, self-renewal and neurogenic functions are segregated between different NSC types.",

    "abstract": "Recent work suggests that obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients have a breakdown in the relationship between explicit beliefs (i.e. confidence about states) and updates to behaviour. The precise computations underlying this disconnection are unclear because case-control and transdiagnostic studies yield conflicting results. Here, a large general population sample (N = 437) completed a predictive inference task previously studied in the context of OCD. We tested if confidence, and its relationship to action and environmental evidence, were specifically associated with self-reported OCD symptoms or common to an array of psychiatric symptoms. We then investigated if a transdiagnostic approach would reveal a stronger and more specific match between metacognitive deficits and clinical phenotypes. Consistent with prior case-control work, we found that decreases in action-confidence coupling were associated with OCD symptoms, but also 5/8 of the other clinical phenotypes tested (8/8 with no correction applied). This non-specific pattern was explained by a single transdiagnostic symptom dimension characterized by compulsivity that was linked to inflated confidence and several deficits in utilizing evidence to update confidence. These data highlight the importance of metacognitive deficits for our understanding of compulsivity and underscore how transdiagnostic methods may prove a more powerful alternative over studies examining single disorders.",

Yet, sometimes, we fail to notice salient events. \\\"Change blindness\\\" - the surprising inability to detect and identify salient changes that occur in flashing visual images - enables measuring such failures in a laboratory setting. We discovered that human participants (n=39) varied widely (by two-fold) in their ability to detect changes when tested on a laboratory change blindness task. To understand the reasons for these differences in change detection abilities, we characterized eye-movement patterns and gaze strategies as participants scanned these images. Surprisingly, we found no systematic differences between scan paths, fixation maps or saccade patterns between participants who were successful at detecting changes, versus those who were not. Yet, two low-level gaze metrics - the mean fixation duration and the variance of saccade amplitudes - systematically predicted change detection success. To explain the mechanism by which these gaze metrics could influence performance, we developed a neurally constrained model, based on the Bayesian framework of sequential probability ratio testing (SPRT), which simulated gaze strategies of successful and unsuccessful observers. The models ability to detect changes varied systematically with mean fixation duration and saccade amplitude variance, closely mimicking observations in the human data. Moreover, the models success rates correlated robustly with human observers success rates, across images. Our model explains putative human attention mechanisms during change blindness tasks and provides key insights into effective strategies for shifting gaze and attention for artificial agents navigating dynamic, crowded environments.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryOur brain has the remarkable capacity to pay attention, selectively, to the most important events in the world around us.

    "abstract": "There is an established, albeit poorly-understood link between psychosis and metabolic abnormalities such as altered glucose metabolism and dyslipidemia, which often precede the initiation of antipsychotic treatment. It is known that obesity-associated metabolic disorders are promoted by peripheral activation of the endocannabinoid system (ECS). Our recent data suggest that ECS dysregulation may also play a role in psychosis. With the aim of characterizing the involvement of the central and peripheral ECSs and their mutual associations, here we performed a combined neuroimaging and metabolomic study in patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) and healthy controls (HC). Regional brain cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) availability was quantified in two, independent samples of patients with FEP (n=20 and n=8) and HC (n=20 and n=10), by applying 3D positron emission tomography (PET), using two radiotracers, [11C]MePPEP and [18F]FMPEP-d2. Ten endogenous endocannabinoids or related metabolites were quantified in serum, drawn from these individuals during the same imaging session. Circulating levels of arachidonic acid and oleyl ethanolamide were reduced in FEP individuals, but not in those who were predominantly medication-free. In HC, there was an inverse association between levels of circulating arachidonoyl glycerol, anandamide, oleyl ethanolamide and palmitoyl ethanolamide, and CB1R availability in the posterior cingulate cortex. This phenomenon was, however, not observed in FEP patients. Our data thus provide evidence of cross-talk and dysregulation between peripheral endocannabinoids and central CB1R availability in FEP.",

    "abstract": "Seedlings must continually calibrate their growth in response to the environment. Auxin and brassinosteroids (BRs) are plant hormones that work together to control growth responses during photomorphogenesis. We used our previous analysis of promoter architecture in an auxin and BR target gene to guide our investigation into the broader molecular bases and biological relevance of transcriptional co-regulation by these hormones. We found that the auxin-regulated transcription factor AUXIN RESPONSIVE FACTOR 5 (ARF5) and the brassinosteroid-regulated transcription factor BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESOR 1/BRASSINOZOLERESISTANT 2 (BES1) co-regulated a subset of growth promoting genes via conserved bipartite cis-regulatory elements. Moreover, ARF5 binding to DNA could be enriched by increasing BES1 levels. The evolutionary loss of bipartite elements in promoters results in loss of hormone responsiveness. We also identified another member of the BES1/BZR1 family called BEH4 that acts partially redundantly with BES1 to regulate seedling growth. Double mutant analysis showed that BEH4 and not BZR1 were required alongside BES1 for normal auxin response during early seedling development. We propose that an ARF5-BES1/BEH4 transcriptional module acts to promote growth via modulation of a diverse set of growth-associated genes.",

    "abstract": "Visual motion stimuli can sometimes distort our perception of time. This effect is dependent on the apparent speed of the moving stimulus, where faster stimuli are usually perceived lasting longer than slower stimuli. Although it has been shown that neural and cognitive processing of biological motion stimuli differ from non-biological motion stimuli, no study has yet investigated whether perceived durations of biological stimuli differ from non-biological stimuli across different speeds. Here, a prospective temporal reproduction task was used to assess that question. Biological motion stimuli consisted in a human silhouette running in place. Non-biological motion stimuli consisted in a rectangle moving in a pendular way. Amount and plausibility of movement for each stimulus and frame-rate (speed) were evaluated by an independent group of participants. Although amount of movement was positively correlated to frame rate, movie clips involving biological motion stimuli were judged to last longer than non-biological motion stimuli only at frame rates in which movement was rated as plausible. These results suggest that plausible representations of biomechanical movement induce additional temporal distortions to those modulated by increases in stimulus speed. Moreover, most studies that have reported neural and cognitive differences in the processing of biological and non-biological motion stimuli acquired neurophysiological data using fMRI. The present study aimed additionally to report differences in the processing of biological and non-biological motion stimuli across different speeds using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a less costly and portable form of neurophysiological data acquisition.",

    "abstract": "Standard methods for case-control association studies of rare variation often treat disease outcome as a dichotomous phenotype. However, both theoretical and experimental studies have demonstrated that subjects with a family history of disease can be enriched for risk variation relative to subjects without such history. Assuming family history information is available, this observation motivates the idea of replacing the standard dichotomous outcome variable used in case-control studies with a more informative ordinal outcome variable that distinguishes controls (0), sporadic cases (1), and cases with a family history (2), with the expectation that we should observe increasing number of risk variants with increasing category of the ordinal variable. To leverage this expectation, we propose a novel rare-variant association test that incorporates family history information based on our previous GAMuT framework (Broadaway et al., 2016) for rare-variant association testing of multivariate phenotypes. We use simulated data to show that, when family history information is available, our new method outperforms standard rare-variant association methods like burden and SKAT tests that ignore family history. We further illustrate our method using a rare-variant study of cleft lip and palate.",

Men have a higher risk of SCD and are more likely to have underlying coronary artery disease (CAD) than women. In contrast, women are more likely to have arrhythmic events in the setting of inherited or acquired QT prolongation. Moreover, there is evidence of sex differences in the underlying genetics of QT interval duration. Using sex- and CAD-stratified analyses, we assess differences in genetic association between prolonged QT interval and SCD risk.\\n\\nMethodsWe examined 2,282 SCD subjects with autopsy-confirmed underlying disease from the Fingesture cohort and 3,561 Finnish controls. The SCD subjects were stratified by underlying disease (ischemic vs. non-ischemic) and by sex. We used logistic regression to test for association between the top QT interval associated SNP, rs12143842 (in the NOS1AP locus), and SCD risk. We also performed Mendelian randomization to test for causal association of QT interval in the various subgroups.\\n\\nResultsFemale SCD victims with underlying non-ischemic disease had the strongest association between rs12143842 and SCD risk (OR=1.37; 95% CI, 1.07-1.75) and the strongest causal association, established using Mendelian randomization, between prolonged QT interval and SCD (OR in SCD risk per SD increase in QT, 3.60; 95% CI, 1.22-10.49).

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Developmental Origins of Adult Disease (DOAD) theory predicts that prenatal and early life events shape adult health outcomes. Birth weight is a useful indicator of the foetal experience, and has been associated with multiple adult health outcomes. DNA methylation (DNAm) is one plausible mechanism behind the relationship of birth weight to adult health.\n\nMethodsThe Generation Scotland study allows data linkage to historic Scottish birth cohorts, and birth records held through the NHS Information and Statistics Division. Data linkage with these sources yielded a sample of 4, 710 individuals. Health measures were related to birth weight in regression models. An epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) was performed in a subgroup (n=1, 395), relating adult DNAm from whole blood to birth weight, with replication in an independent sample (n=362). Associations between birth weight and epigenetic clocks were also assessed.\n\nFindingsHigher birth weight was significantly associated with reduced incidence of depression and osteoarthritis, higher body mass index, and higher general intelligence (absolute standardised effect size range 0{middle dot}04 to 0{middle dot}30, p(FDR)<0{middle dot}05). Meta-analysis of discovery and replication EWAS studies yielded one genome-wide significant CpG site (p=5{middle dot}97x10-9), cg00966482. Significant associations between birth weight and Grim Age (p=0{middle dot}0014) and DNAm-derived telomere length (p=3{middle dot}3x10-4) are also described.\n\nInterpretationOur results demonstrate associations between birth weight and adult health outcomes, with particularly striking effects for depression risk. It also provides support for an association between birth weight and DNAm, describing the first significant EWAS site associated with birth weight in an adult sample.\n\nFundingWellcome Trust Strategic Award 104036/Z/14/Z\n\nResearch in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe associations between birth weight and various adult health outcomes have been well established. DNA methylation is a plausible mechanism through which early life experiences may continue to affect health throughout the lifecourse; however, evidence for birth weight associations with DNA methylation in adulthood has not yet been robustly established. This is likely due to small sample sizes of previous samples, as well as the use of poor-quality birth weight data, such as binary  low/normal variables or retrospective self-report. Alternatively, work has attempted to describe the persistence into adulthood of DNA methylation at sites identified at birth.\n\nAdded value of this studyWe investigated genome-wide differential DNA methylation patterns from whole blood using data linkage-derived, continuous birth weight data, in the largest reported adult sample (n=1, 395) with replication (n=362) and meta-analysis. Meta-analysis revealed one epigenome-wide significant CpG site, to our knowledge the first significant EWAS result reported for birth weight in a an adult sample. In addition, we found associations between birth weight and GrimAge and a DNA methylation-derived measure of telomere length, demonstrating accelerated biological ageing in lower birth weight individuals. Together, these results suggest differential methylation exists in adulthood related to birth weight, and this may be relevant to health and mortality.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceAlthough CpG sites differentially methylated with birth weight at parturition may not remain so throughout life, the adult epigenome may still provide information on the impact of birth weight on health outcomes. The adult epigenome, therefore, may represent a useful archive of the foetal experience which results in birth weight variability, and this information may provide clinically useful information in mid-life.",

While these tools have been shown to boost statistical power considerably over univariate tests, an important remaining challenge is to interpret which traits are driving the multivariate association and which traits are just passengers with minor contributions to the genotype-phenotypes association statistic.\n\nResultsWe introduce MetaPhat, a novel bioinformatics tool to conduct GWAS of multivariate and correlated traits using univariate summary results and to decompose multivariate associations into sets of central traits based on intuitive trace plots that visualize Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and P-value statistics of multivariate association models. We validate MetaPhat with Global Lipids Genetics Consortium GWAS results, and we apply MetaPhat to univariate GWAS results for 21 heritable and correlated polyunsaturated lipid species from 2,045 Finnish samples, detecting 7 independent loci associated with a cluster of lipid species. In most cases, we are able to decompose these multivariate associations to only 3-5 central traits out of all 21 traits included in the analyses. We release MetaPhat as an open source tool written in Python with built-in support for multi-processing, quality control, clumping and intuitive visualizations using the R software.\n\nConclusionsMetaPhat efficiently decomposes associations between multivariate phenotypes and genetic variants into smaller sets of central traits and improves the interpretation and specificity of genome-phenome associations.\n\nMetaPhat is available under the MIT license at: https://sourceforge.net/projects/meta-pheno-association-tracer",

    "abstract": "New technologies and analysis methods are enabling genomic structural variants (SVs) to be detected with ever-increasing accuracy, resolution, and comprehensiveness. Translating these methods to routine research and clinical practice requires robust benchmark sets. We developed the first benchmark set for identification of both false negative and false positive germline SVs, which complements recent efforts emphasizing increasingly comprehensive characterization of SVs. To create this benchmark for a broadly consented son in a Personal Genome Project trio with broadly available cells and DNA, the Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) Consortium integrated 19 sequence-resolved variant calling methods, both alignment- and de novo assembly-based, from short-, linked-, and long-read sequencing, as well as optical and electronic mapping. The final benchmark set contains 12745 isolated, sequence-resolved insertion and deletion calls [&ge;]50 base pairs (bp) discovered by at least 2 technologies or 5 callsets, genotyped as heterozygous or homozygous variants by long reads. The Tier 1 benchmark regions, for which any extra calls are putative false positives, cover 2.66 Gbp and 9641 SVs supported by at least one diploid assembly. Support for SVs was assessed using svviz with short-, linked-, and long-read sequence data. In general, there was strong support from multiple technologies for the benchmark SVs, with 90 % of the Tier 1 SVs having support in reads from more than one technology. The Mendelian genotype error rate was 0.3 %, and genotype concordance with manual curation was >98.7 %. We demonstrate the utility of the benchmark set by showing it reliably identifies both false negatives and false positives in high-quality SV callsets from short-, linked-, and long-read sequencing and optical mapping.",

    "abstract": "Macrophages are innate immune cells with diverse functional and molecular phenotypes. This diversity is largely unexplored at the level of single-cell proteomes because of limitations of quantitative single-cell protein analysis. To overcome this limitation, we developed SCoPE2, which substantially increases quantitative accuracy and throughput while lowering cost and hands-on time by introducing automated and miniaturized sample preparation. These advances enable us to analyze the emergence of cellular heterogeneity as homogeneous monocytes differentiate into macrophage-like cells in the absence of polarizing cytokines. SCoPE2 quantified over 3,042 proteins in 1,490 single monocytes and macrophages in ten days of instrument time, and the quantified proteins allow us to discern single cells by cell type. Furthermore, the data uncover a continuous gradient of proteome states for the macrophages, suggesting that macrophage heterogeneity may emerge in the absence of polarizing cytokines. This gradient correlates to the inflammatory axis of classically and alternatively activated macrophages. Parallel measurements of transcripts by 10x Genomics suggest that our measurements sample 20-fold more protein copies than RNA copies per gene, and thus SCoPE2 supports quantification with improved count statistics. The joint distributions of proteins and transcripts allowed exploring regulatory interactions, such as between the tumor suppressor p53, its transcript, and the transcripts of genes regulated by p53. Our methodology lays the foundation for quantitative single-cell analysis of proteins by mass-spectrometry and demonstrates the potential for inferring transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation from variability across single cells.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=60 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/665307v5_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (19K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18ead97org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@26b51aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13bd6a8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@189cf00_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

We have hypothesized that interneuronopathy contributes significantly to the pathoetiology of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Activity-dependent tangential migration of GABAergic cortical neurons is driven by depolarizing responses to ambient GABA present in the cortical enclave. We found that ethanol exposure potentiates the depolarizing action of GABA in GABAergic cortical interneurons of the embryonic mouse brain. Pharmacological antagonism of the cotransporter NKCC1 mitigated ethanol-induced potentiation of GABA depolarization and prevented aberrant patterns of tangential migration induced by ethanol in vitro. In a model of FASD, maternal bumetanide treatment prevented interneuronopathy in the prefrontal cortex of ethanol exposed offspring, including deficits in behavioral flexibility. These findings position interneuronopathy as a mechanism of FASD symptomatology, and posit NKCC1 as a pharmacological target for the management of FASD.",

    "abstract": "Many navigating insects include the celestial polarization pattern as an additional visual cue to orient their travels. Spontaneous orientation responses of both walking and flying fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) to linearly polarized light have previously been demonstrated. Using newly designed modular flight arenas consisting entirely of off-the-shelf parts and 3D-printed components we present individual flying flies with a slow and continuous rotational change in the incident angle of linear polarization. Under such open-loop conditions, single flies choose arbitrary headings with respect to the angle of polarized light and show a clear tendency to maintain those chosen headings for several minutes, thereby adjusting their course to the slow rotation of the incident stimulus. Importantly, flies show the tendency to maintain a chosen heading even when two individual test periods under a linearly polarized stimulus are interrupted by an epoch of unpolarized light lasting several minutes. Finally, we show that these behavioral responses are wavelength-specific, existing under polarized UV stimulus while being absent under polarized green light. Taken together, these findings provide further evidence supporting Drosophilas abilities to use celestial cues for visually guided navigation and course correction.",

    "abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO) is a key signaling molecule that regulates diverse biological processes in both animals and plants. In animals, NO regulates vascular wall tone, neurotransmission and immune response while in plants, NO is essential for development and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses [1-3]. Interestingly, NO is involved in the sexual reproduction of both animals and plants mediating physiological events related to the male gamete [2, 4]. In animals, NO stimulates sperm motility [4] and binding to the plasma membrane of oocytes [5] while in plants, NO mediates pollen-stigma interactions and pollen tube guidance [6, 7]. NO generation in pollen tubes (PTs) has been demonstrated [8] and intracellular responses to NO include cytosolic Ca2+ elevation, actin organization, vesicle trafficking and cell wall deposition [7, 9]. However, the NO-responsive proteins that mediate these responses are still elusive. Here we show that PTs of Arabidopsis lacking the pollen-specific Diacylglycerol Kinase 4 (DGK4) grow slower and become insensitive to NO-dependent growth inhibition and re-orientation responses. Recombinant DGK4 protein yields NO-responsive spectral and catalytic changes in vitro which are compatible with a role in NO perception and signaling in PTs. NO is a fast, diffusible gas and, based on our results, we hypothesize it could serve in long range signaling and/or rapid cell-cell communication functions mediated by DGK4 downstream signaling during the progamic phase of angiosperm reproduction.",
