    "abstract": "While multifocal electroretinography has become a standard ophthalmological technique, its use in cortical neuroimaging has been lesser. Vanni et al. (2005) presented the first exploration of the multifocal visual mapping methodology with fMRI. This commentary confirms the utility of this method, but also presents empirical results which suggest caveats for the use of the technique. In the current study rapid multifocal fMRI was established using m-sequence pseudo-random binary stimuli applied to visual field mapping in six young adults with normal vision. Nine contiguous regions of visual field - two rings of 4 patches with a central patch, areas scaled for cortical magnification, were pseudo-randomly stimulated, with patterned or grey images. The decorrelation of stimulus patches allowed all 256 volumes to be used for the analysis of each of the nine stimulus areas. Strong localized activation was observed for each of the four peripheral regions with the location of the activation conforming to the expected visual field retinotopy. The inner regions, including the foveal patch, did not significantly activate. We propose, on the basis of a simple correlational model of simulated eye movements, that the loss of signal is due to gaze instability. Thus, while the rapid multifocal method can be successfully applied to fMRI, the results appear quite sensitive to eye movements, the effects of which may have been overlooked by smoothing evoked responses to achieve a retinotopic map.",

    "abstract": "A prominent model of pain as a predictive cue posits that anticipation shapes pain transmission and ultimately pain experience. Consistent with this model, the neural mechanisms underlying pain anticipation have the power to modulate pain experience thus understanding pain predictions, particularly during uncertainty, may allow us to ascertain measures indicative of intrinsic anticipation biases. Understanding such biases moves way to precision pain management, as it can guide the individualized treatment. To examine individual pain anticipation biases, we applied machine-learning-based neural decoding to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired during a pain-anticipation paradigm to identify individualized neural activation patterns differentiating two certain anticipatory conditions, which we then used to decode that individuals uncertain anticipatory condition. We showed that neural patterns representative of the individualized response during certain anticipatory conditions were differentiable with high accuracy and, across individuals, most commonly involved neural activation patterns within anterior short gyrus of the insula and the nucleus accumbens. Using unsupervised clustering of individualized decodings of anticipatory responses during uncertain conditions, we identified three distinct response profiles representing subjects who, in uncertain situations, consistently anticipated high-pain (i.e., negative bias), subjects who consistently anticipated low-pain (i.e., positive bias), and subjects whose decoded anticipation responses were depended on the intensity of the preceding pain stimulus. The individualized decoded pain anticipation biases during uncertainty were independent of existence or type of diagnosed psychopathology, were stable over one year timespan and were related to underlying insula anatomy. Our results suggest that anticipation behaviors may be intrinsic, stable, and specific to each individual. Understanding individual differences in the neurobiology of pain anticipation has the potential to greatly improve the clinical pain management.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLong-read sequencing facilitates assembly of complex genomic regions. In plants, loci containing nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat (NLR) disease resistance genes are an important example of such regions. NLR genes make up one of the largest gene families in plants and are often clustered, evolving via duplication, contraction, and transposition. We recently mapped the Xo1 locus for resistance to bacterial blight and bacterial leaf streak, found in the American heirloom rice variety Carolina Gold Select, to a region that in the Nipponbare reference genome is rich in NLR genes.\\n\\nResultsToward identification of the Xo1 gene, we combined Nanopore and Illumina reads to generate a high-quality genome assembly for Carolina Gold Select. We identified 529 full or partial NLR genes and discovered, relative to the reference, an expansion of NLR genes at the Xo1 locus. One NLR gene at Xo1 has high sequence similarity to the cloned, functionally similar Xa1 gene. Both harbor an integrated zfBED domain and near-identical, tandem, C-terminal repeats. Across diverse Oryzeae, we identified two sub-clades of such NLR genes, varying in the presence of the zfBED domain and the number of repeats.\\n\\nConclusionsWhole genome sequencing combining Nanopore and Illumina reads effectively resolves NLR gene loci, providing context as well as content. Our identification of an Xo1 candidate is an important step toward mechanistic characterization, including the role(s) of the zfBED domain. Further, the Carolina Gold Select genome assembly will facilitate identification and exploitation of other useful traits in this historically important rice variety.",

This customized approach is dependent upon the development of pathway-specific therapeutics in conjunction with biomarkers that predict patient responses. Here, we show that Cdk5 drives growth in subgroups of human patients with multiple types of neuroendocrine neoplasms. Phosphoproteomics and high throughput screening identified novel phosphorylation sites downstream of Cdk5. These phosphorylation events serve as biomarkers of Cdk5 activity and effectively pinpoint Cdk5-driven tumors. Toward achieving targeted therapy, we demonstrate that mouse models of neuroendocrine cancer are responsive to selective Cdk5 inhibitors and biomimetic nanoparticles are effective vehicles for enhanced tumor targeting and reduction of drug toxicity. Finally, we show that biomarkers of Cdk5-dependent tumors effectively predict response to anti-Cdk5 therapy in patient-derived xenografts. Thus, a phosphoprotein-based diagnostic assay combined with Cdk5-targeted therapy is a rational treatment approach for neuroendocrine malignancies.",

    "abstract": "Stalk lodging in maize results in substantial yield losses worldwide. These losses could be prevented through genetic improvement. However, breeding efforts and genetics studies are hindered by lack of a robust and economical phenotyping method for assessing stalk lodging resistance. A field-based phenotyping platform that induces failure patterns consistent with natural stalk lodging events and measures stalk bending strength in field-grown plants was recently developed. Here we examine the association between data gathered from this new phenotyping platform with counts of stalk lodging incidence on a select group of maize hybrids. For comparative purposes, we examine four additional predictive phenotypes commonly assumed to be related to stalk lodging resistance; namely, rind puncture resistance, cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Historical counts of lodging incidence were gathered on 47 hybrids, grown in 98 distinct environments, spanning four years and 41 unique geographical locations in North America. Using Bayesian generalized linear mixed effects models, we show that stalk lodging incidence is associated with each of the five predictive phenotypes. Further, based on a joint analysis we demonstrate that, among the phenotypes considered, stalk bending strength measured by the new phenotyping platform is the most important predictive phenotype of naturally occurring stalk lodging incidence in maize, followed by rind puncture resistance and cellulose content. This study demonstrates that field-based measurements of stalk bending strength provide a reliable estimate of stalk lodging incidence. The stalk bending strength data acquired from the new phenotyping platform will be valuable for phenotypic selection in breeding programs and for generating mechanistic insights into the genetic regulation of stalk lodging resistance.",

    "abstract": "Consciousness is a central issue in cognitive neuroscience. To explain the relationship between consciousness and its neural correlates, various theories have been proposed. We still lack a formal framework that can address the nature of the relationship between consciousness and its physical substrates though. Here, we provide a novel mathematical framework of Category Theory (CT), in which we can define and study the \\\"sameness\\\" between \\\"different\\\" domains of phenomena such as consciousness and its neural substrates. CT was designed and developed to deal with the \\\"relationships\\\" between various domains of phenomena. We introduce three concepts of CT including (i) category; (ii) inclusion functor and expansion functor; and (iii) natural transformation between the functors. Each of these mathematical concepts is related to specific features in the neural correlates of consciousness (NCC). In this novel framework, we will examine two of the major theories of consciousness: integrated information theory (IIT) of consciousness and temporo-spatial theory of consciousness (TTC). These theories concern the structural relationships among structures of physical substrates and subjective experiences. The three CT-based concepts, introduced in this paper, unravel some basic issues in our search for the NCC; while addressing the same questions, we show that IIT and TTC provide different albeit complementary answers. Importantly, our account suggests that we need to go beyond a traditional concept of NCC including both content-specific and full NCC. We need to shift our focus from the relationship between \\\"one\\\" neuronal and \\\"one\\\" phenomenal state to the relationship between a structure of neural states and a structure of phenomenal states. We conclude that CT unravels and highlights basic questions about the NCC in general which needs to be met and addressed by any future neuroscientific theory of consciousness.\\n\\nAuthor summaryNeuroscience has made considerable progress in uncovering the neural correlates of consciousness (NCC). At the same time, recent studies demonstrated the complexity of the neuronal mechanisms underlying consciousness. To make further progress in the neuroscience of consciousness, we need proper mathematical formalization of the neuronal mechanisms potentially underlying consciousness. Providing a first tentative attempt, our paper addresses both by (i) pointing out the specific problems of and proposing a new approach to go beyond the traditional approach of the neural correlates of consciousness, and (ii) by recruiting a recently popular mathematical formalization, category theory (CT). With CT, we provide mathematical formalization of the broader neural correlates of consciousness by its application to two of the major theories, integrated information theory (IIT) and temporo-spatial theory of consciousness (TTC). Together, our CT-based mathematical formalization of the neural correlates of consciousness including its specification in the terms of IIT and TTC allows to go beyond the current concept of NCC in both mathematical and neural terms.",

    "abstract": "Recently developed molecular methods allow large-scale profiling of T-cell receptor (TCR) sequences that encode for antigen specificity and immunological memory of these cells. However, it is well known, that the even unperturbed TCR repertoire structure is extremely complex due to the high diversity of TCR rearrangements and multiple biases imprinted by VDJ rearrangement process. The latter gives rise to the phenomenon of \\\"public\\\" TCR clonotypes that can be shared across multiple individuals and non-trivial structure of the TCR similarity network. Here we outline a framework for TCR sequencing data analysis that can control for these biases in order to infer TCRs that are involved in response to antigens of interest. Using an example dataset of donors with known HLA haplotype and CMV status we demonstrate that by applying HLA restriction rules and matching against a database of TCRs with known antigen specificity it is possible to robustly detect motifs of an epitope-specific responses in individual repertoires. We also highlight potential shortcomings of TCR clustering methods and demonstrate that highly expanded TCRs should be individually assessed to get the full picture of antigen-specific response.",

    "abstract": "Type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) are nanomachines widely used by bacteria to compete with rivals. T6SSs deliver multiple toxic effector proteins directly into neighbouring cells and play key roles in shaping diverse polymicrobial communities. A number of families of T6SS-dependent anti-bacterial effectors have been characterised, however the mode of action of others remains unknown. Here we report that Ssp6, an anti-bacterial effector delivered by the Serratia marcescens T6SS, is an ion-selective pore-forming toxin. In vivo, Ssp6 inhibits growth by causing depolarisation of the inner membrane of intoxicated cells and also leads to increased outer membrane permeability, whilst reconstruction of Ssp6 activity in vitro demonstrated that it forms cation-selective pores. A survey of bacterial genomes revealed that Ssp6-like effectors are widespread in Enterobacteriaceae and often linked with T6SS genes. We conclude that Ssp6 represents a new family of T6SS-delivered anti-bacterial effectors, further diversifying the portfolio of weapons available for deployment during inter-bacterial conflict.",

    "abstract": "Chloroplasts are unique organelles within the plant cells and are responsible for sustaining life forms on the earth due to their ability to conduct photosynthesis. Multiple functional genes within the chloroplast are responsible for a variety of metabolic processes that occur in the chloroplast. Considering its fundamental role in sustaining life on the earth, it is important to identify the level of diversity present in the chloroplast genome, what genes and genomic content have been lost, what genes have been transferred to the nuclear genome, duplication events, and the overall origin and evolution of the chloroplast genome. Our analysis of 2511 chloroplast genomes indicated that the genome size and number of coding DNA sequences (CDS) in the chloroplasts genome of algae are higher relative to other lineages. Approximately 10.31% of the examined species have lost the inverted repeats (IR) in the chloroplast genome that span across all the lineages. Genome-wide analyses revealed the loss of the Rbcl gene in parasitic and heterotrophic plants occurred approximately 56 Ma ago. PsaM, Psb30, ChlB, ChlL, ChlN, and Rpl21 were found to be characteristic signature genes of the chloroplast genome of algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes, and gymnosperms; however, none of these genes were found in the angiosperm or magnoliid lineage which appeared to have lost them approximately 203-156 Ma ago. A variety of chloroplast-encoded genes were lost across different species lineages throughout the evolutionary process. The Rpl20 gene, however, was found to be the most stable and intact gene in the chloroplast genome and was not lost in any of the analyzed species, suggesting that it is a signature gene of the plastome. Our evolutionary analysis indicated that chloroplast genomes evolved from multiple common ancestors ~1293 Ma ago and have undergone vivid recombination events across different taxonomic lineages.",

Seed metabolism relies on stored resources and is re-activated to drive germination when the external conditions are favorable. Since the switchover from quiescence to re-activation provides a remarkable case of a cell physiological transition we investigated the earliest events in energy and redox metabolism of Arabidopsis seeds at imbibition. By developing fluorescent protein biosensing in intact seeds, we observed ATP accumulation and oxygen uptake within minutes, indicating rapid activation of mitochondrial respiration, which coincided with a sharp transition from an oxidizing to a more reducing thiol redox environment in the mitochondrial matrix. To identify individual operational protein thiol switches, we captured the fast release of metabolic quiescence in organello and devised quantitative iodoacetyl tandem mass tag-based (iodoTMT) thiol redox proteomics. The redox state across all Cys-peptides was shifted towards reduction from 27.1 % to 13.0 %. A large number of Cys-peptides (412) were redox-switched, representing central pathways of mitochondrial energy metabolism, including the respiratory chain and each enzymatic step of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). Active site Cys-peptides of glutathione reductase 2, NADPH-thioredoxin reductase a/b and thioredoxin-o1 showed the strongest responses. Germination of seeds lacking those redox proteins was associated with markedly enhanced respiration and deregulated TCA cycle dynamics suggesting decreased resource efficiency of energy metabolism. Germination in aged seeds was strongly impaired. We identify a global operation of thiol redox switches that is required for optimal usage of energy stores by the mitochondria to drive efficient germination.",

Integrative analysis of RNA splicing and chromatin occupancy, combined with chromatin tethering assays, demonstrate that DNA-bound RELA interacts with and recruits the splicing regulator DDX17 in a NF-kB activation-dependent manner, leading to alternative splicing of target exons thanks to DDX17 RNA helicase activity. This NF-kB/DDX17 axis accounts for a major part of the TAX-induced alternative splicing landscape that mainly affects genes involved in oncogenic pathways.

TSG-6 has several known biological functions including enzymatic transfer of heavy chain proteins (HC) from inter--trypsin inhibitor to hyaluronan (HA) to form HC-HA complexes. TSG-6 and HC-HA are constitutively expressed in normal skin and increase post-wounding, but are completely absent in TSG-6 null mice. Wound closure rates are significantly delayed in TSG-6 null mice relative to wildtype mice. Neutrophil recruitment is delayed in early wounds (12 h and Day 1), whereas late wounds (Day 7) show elevated neutrophil accumulation. In addition, the granulation phase is delayed, with persistent blood vessels and reduced dermal collagen at 10 days. The pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF is elevated >3 fold in unwounded TSG-6 null skin, and increases further after wounding (from 12 h to 7 days) before returning to baseline by day 10. Other cytokines examined such as IL-6, IL-10, and MCP-1 showed no consistent differences. Importantly, reintroduction of TSG-6 into TSG-6 null wounds rescues both the delay in wound closure and the aberrant neutrophil phenotype. In summary, our study indicates that TSG-6 plays an important role in regulating wound closure and inflammation during cutaneous wound repair.",
