    "abstract": "Epilepsy diagnosis can be costly, time-consuming and not uncommonly inaccurate. The reference standard diagnostic monitoring is continuous video-EEG monitoring, ideally capturing all events or concordant interictal discharges. Automating EEG data review would save time and resources, thus enabling more people to receive reference standard monitoring and also potentially herald a more quantitative approach to therapeutic outcomes. There is substantial research into automated detection of seizures and epileptic activity from EEG. However, automated detection software is not widely used in the clinic; and, despite numerous published algorithms, few methods have regulatory approval for detecting epileptic activity from EEG.\\n\\nThis study reports on a deep learning algorithm for computer-assisted EEG review. Deep, convolutional neural networks were trained to detect epileptic discharges using a pre-existing dataset of over 6000 labelled events in a cohort of 103 patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE). Patients underwent 24-hour ambulatory outpatient EEG, and all data was curated and confirmed independently by two epilepsy specialists (Seneviratne et al, 2016). The resulting automated detection algorithm was then used to review diagnostic scalp-EEG for seven patients (four with IGE and three with events mimicking seizures) to validate performance in a clinical setting.\\n\\nThe automated detection algorithm showed state-of-the-art performance for detecting epileptic activity from clinical EEG, with mean sensitivity of >95% and corresponding mean false positive rate of 1 detection per minute. Importantly, diagnostic case studies showed that the automated detection algorithm reduced human review time by 80%-99%, without compromising event detection or diagnostic accuracy. The presented results demonstrate that computer-assisted review can increase the speed and accuracy of EEG assessment and has the potential to greatly improve therapeutic outcomes.",

We report here the discovery of a conserved protein family across seed plants that is structurally homologous to vertebrate MLKL. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes three MLKLs with overlapping functions in limiting growth of obligate biotrophic fungal and oomycete pathogens. Although displaying a cell death activity mediated by N-terminal helical bundles, termed HeLo domain, AtMLKL-dependent immunity can be separated from host cell death. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of AtMLKLs reveal a tetrameric configuration, in which the pseudokinase domain and brace region bury the HeLo-domains, indicative of an auto-repressed complex. We also show the association of two AtMLKLs with microtubules. These findings, coupled with resistance-enhancing activity and altered microtubule association of a phosphomimetic mutation in the pseudokinase domain of AtMLKL1, point to a cell death-independent immunity mechanism.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryPlants have a protein family that is structurally homologous to vertebrate mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein, which induces necroptotic cell death, but these plant proteins can confer immunity without host cell death.",

    "abstract": "Systemic hypoxia resulting from preterm birth, altered lung development, and cyanotic congenital heart disease is known to impede the regulatory and developmental pathways in the neonatal heart. While the molecular mechanisms are still unknown, hypoxia induces aberrant cardiomyocyte proliferation, which may be initially adaptive, but can ultimately program the heart to fail in early life. Recent evidence suggests that the prostaglandin E1 analogue, misoprostol, is cytoprotective in the hypoxia-exposed neonatal heart by impacting alternative splicing of the Bcl-2 family member Bnip3, resulting in the generation of a variant lacking the third exon (Bnip3{Delta}Exon3 or small Nip; sNip). Using a rodent model of neonatal hypoxia, in combination with rat primary neonatal cardiomyocytes (PVNCs) and H9c2 cells, we sought to determine if misoprostol can prevent cardiomyocyte proliferation and what the key molecular mechanisms might be in this pathway. In PVNCs, exposure to 10% oxygen induced myocyte proliferation concurrent with molecular markers of cell-cycle progression, such as Cyclin-D1, which were prevented by misoprostol treatment. Furthermore, we describe a critical role for sNip in opposing cardiomyocyte proliferation through several mechanisms, including reduced expression of the proliferative MEF2C-myocardin-BMP10 pathway, accumulation of nuclear calcium leading to NFATc3 activation, and increased expression of the cardiac maturation factor BMP2. Intriguingly, misoprostol and sNip inhibited hypoxia-induced glycolytic flux, which directly influenced myocyte proliferation. These observations were further supported by knockdown studies, where hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte proliferation is restored in misoprostol-treated cells by an siRNA targeting sNip. Finally, in postnatal day (PND)-10 rat pups exposed to hypoxia, we observed histological evidence of increased nuclei number and increased PPH3 staining, which were completely attenuated by misoprostol treatment. Collectively, this data demonstrates how neonatal cardiomyocyte proliferation can be pharmacologically modulated by misoprostol treatment, which may have important implications for both neonatal and regenerative medicine.",

    "abstract": "Key ecological traits, like cell size, often follow scale-free or self-similar distributions. This indicates that these systems might operate near a critical (i.e. second-order) phase transition where macroscopic system behaviour is largely decoupled from microscopic system details, allowing an extremely simple, yet accurate and robust mathematical system characterisation. However, how trait-distribution scaling results from a critical transition has not yet been explicitly demonstrated. Here, we demonstrate that a generic class of cell growth and division models exhibits a critical transition from a growth-dominated to a division-dominated phase. We find experimental evidence for this transition, both in the population dynamics and in the moment scaling of chlorophyll distributions, for prokaryotic and eukaryotic phytoplankton growth under different light intensities. Our approach offers testable predictions of the response of unicellular trait-distributions to perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Although genomic sequencing has been transformative in the study of rare genetic diseases, identifying causal variants remains a considerable challenge that can be addressed in part by new gene-specific knowledge. Here, we integrate measures of how essential a gene is to supporting life, as inferred from the comprehensive viability and phenotyping screens performed on knockout mice by the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium and from human cell line essentiality screens. We propose a novel, cross-species gene classification across the Full Spectrum of Intolerance to Loss-of-function (FUSIL) and demonstrate that genes in five mutually exclusive FUSIL categories have differing characteristics in the biological processes they regulate, tissue expression levels and human mutation rates. Most notably, Mendelian disease genes, particularly those associated with developmental disorders, are highly overrepresented in the developmental lethal category, representing genes not essential for cell survival but required for organism development. Exploiting this finding, we have screened developmental disorder cases from three independent disease sequencing consortia and identified potentially pathogenic, de novo variants shared in different patients for several developmental lethal genes that have not previously been associated with rare disease. We therefore propose FUSIL as an efficient resource for disease gene discovery.",

    "abstract": "Posterior cortical atrophy is a clinical-radiological syndrome characterized by visual processing deficits and atrophy in posterior parts of the brain, most often caused by Alzheimers disease pathology. Recent consensus criteria describe four distinct phenotypical variants of posterior cortical atrophy defined by clinical and radiological features; i) object perception/occipitotemporal (ventral), ii) space perception/temporoparietal (dorsal), iii) non-visual/dominant parietal and iv) primary visual (caudal). We employed a data-driven approach to identify atrophy factors related to these proposed variants in a multi-center cohort of 119 individuals with posterior cortical atrophy (age: 64 SD 7, 38% male, MMSE: 21 SD 5, 71% amyloid-{beta} positive, 29% amyloid-{beta} status unknown). A Bayesian modelling framework based on latent Dirichlet allocation was used to compute four latent atrophy factors in accordance with the four proposed variants. The model uses standardized gray matter density images as input (adjusted for age, sex, intracranial volume, field strength and whole-brain gray matter volume) and provides voxelwise probabilistic maps for all atrophy factors, allowing every individual to express each factor to a degree without a priori classification. The model revealed four distinct yet partially overlapping atrophy factors; right-dorsal, right-ventral, left-ventral, and limbic. Individual participant profiles revealed that the vast majority of participants expressed multiple factors, rather than predominantly expressing a single factor. To assess the relationship between atrophy factors and cognition, neuropsychological test scores covering four posterior cortical atrophy-specific cognitive domains were assessed (object perception, space perception, non-visual parietal functions and primary visual processing) and we used general linear models to examine the association between atrophy factor expression and cognition. We found that object perception and primary visual processing were associated with atrophy that predominantly reflects the right-ventral factor. Furthermore, space perception was associated with atrophy that predominantly represents the right-ventral and right-dorsal factors. Similar to the atrophy factors, most participants had mixed clinical profiles with impairments across multiple domains. However, when selecting four participants with an isolated impairment, we observed atrophy patterns and factor expressions that were largely in accordance with the hypothesized variants. Taken together, our results indicate that variants of posterior cortical atrophy exist but these constitute phenotypical extremes and most individuals fall along a broad clinical-radiological spectrum, indicating that classification into four mutually exclusive variants is unlikely to be clinically useful.",

The process of deliberation on the evidence can be described by a time-varying decision variable (DV), decoded from neural activity, that predicts a subjects decision at the end of a trial. However, within trials, large moment-to-moment fluctuations of the DV are observed. The behavioral significance of these fluctuations and their role in the decision process remain unclear. Here we show that within-trial DV fluctuations decoded in real time from motor cortex are tightly linked to choice behavior, and that robust changes in DV sign have the statistical regularities expected from behavioral studies of changes-of-mind. Furthermore, we find single-trial evidence for absorbing decision bounds. As the DV builds up, heavily favoring one or the other choice, moment-to-moment variability in the DV is reduced, and both neural DV and behavioral decisions become resistant to additional pulses of sensory evidence as predicted by diffusion-to-bound and attractor models of the decision process.",

Upon rehydration, iVAX reactions synthesize clinically relevant doses of bioconjugate vaccines against diverse bacterial pathogens in one hour. We show that iVAX synthesized vaccines against the highly virulent pathogen Franciscella tularensis subsp. tularensis (type A) strain Schu S4 elicited pathogen-specific antibodies in mice at significantly higher levels compared to vaccines produced using engineered bacteria.

Using convolutional neural networks on a large new dataset, we show that deep learning applied to echocardiography can identify local cardiac structures, estimate cardiac function, and predict systemic phenotypes that modify cardiovascular risk but not readily identifiable to human interpretation. Our deep learning model, EchoNet, accurately identified the presence of pacemaker leads (AUC = 0.89), enlarged left atrium (AUC = 0.85), normal left ventricular wall thickness (AUC = 0.75), left ventricular end systolic and diastolic volumes(R2 = 0.73 and R2 = 0.68), and ejection fraction (R2 = 0.48) as well as predicted systemic phenotypes of age (R2 = 0.46), sex (AUC = 0.88), weight (R2 = 0.56), and height (R2 = 0.33). Interpretation analysis validates that EchoNet shows appropriate attention to key cardiac structures when performing human-explainable tasks and highlight hypothesis-generating regions of interest when predicting systemic phenotypes difficult for human interpretation. Machine learning on echocardiography images can streamline repetitive tasks in the clinical workflow, standardize interpretation in areas with insufficient qualified cardiologists, and more consistently produce echocardiographic measurements.",

    "abstract": "Genomic imprinting is a process thereby a subset of genes is expressed in a parent-of-origin specific manner. This evolutionary novelty is restricted to mammals and controlled by genomic DNA segments known as Imprinting Control Regions (ICRs). The known imprinted genes function in many important developmental and postnatal processes including organogenesis, neurogenesis, and fertility. Furthermore, defects in imprinted genes could cause severe diseases and abnormalities. Because of the importance of the ICRs to the regulation of parent-of-origin specific gene expression, I developed a genome-wide strategy for their localization. This strategy located clusters of the ZFBS-Morph overlaps along the entire human genome. Previously, I showed that in the mouse genome, clusters of 2 or more of these overlaps correctly located [~] 90% of the fully characterized ICRs and germline Differentially Methylated Regions (gDMRs). The ZFBS-Morph overlaps are composite-DNA-elements comprised of the ZFP57 binding site (ZFBS) overlapping a subset of the MLL1 morphemes. My strategy consists of creating plots to display the density of ZFBS-Morph overlaps along genomic DNA. Peaks in these plots pinpointed several of the known ICRs/gDMRs within relatively long genomic DNA sections and even along entire chromosomal DNA. Therefore, peaks in the density-plots are likely to reflect the positions of known or candidate ICRs. I also found that by locating the genes in the vicinity of candidate ICRs, I could discover potential and novel human imprinting genes. Additionally, my exploratory assessments revealed a connection between several of the potential imprinted genes and human developmental anomalies including syndromes.",

    "abstract": "Long 5' UTRs in bacteria often contain regulatory elements that modulate expression of the downstream gene in response to environmental stimuli. In most examples of such regulation, the mechanism involves switching between alternative 5' UTR RNA structures that impact transcription, stability, or translation of the mRNA. Here, we show that transcription of the Escherichia coli topAI gene is prematurely terminated by the termination factor Rho under standard laboratory growth conditions, and that this occurs as a result of translational repression. Regulation of topAI translation is controlled by a sensory ORF, toiL, located within the topAI 5' UTR. We show that ribosomes translating toiL stall in a sequence-specific manner in the presence of specific ribosome-targeting antibiotics. Ribosome stalling at toiL induces conformational changes in the RNA structure of the topAI 5' UTR, unmasking the topAI ribosome-binding site, thereby relieving translational repression and preventing premature transcription termination. Thus, toiL acts as a sensor of translation stress, leading to regulation of topAI at both the translational and transcriptional levels.",

    "abstract": "Shigella species are specialised lineages of Escherichia coli that have converged to become human-adapted and cause dysentery by invading human gut epithelial cells. Most studies of Shigella evolution have been restricted to comparisons of single representatives of each species; and population genomic studies of individual Shigella species have focused on genomic variation caused by single nucleotide variants and ignored the contribution of insertion sequences (IS) which are highly prevalent in Shigella genomes. Here, we investigate the distribution and evolutionary dynamics of IS within populations of Shigella dysenteriae Sd1, Shigella sonnei and Shigella flexneri. We find that five IS (IS1, IS2, IS4, IS600 and IS911) have undergone expansion in all Shigella species, creating substantial strain-to-strain variation within each population and contributing to convergent patterns of functional gene loss within and between species. We find that IS expansion and genome degradation are most advanced in S. dysenteriae and least advanced in S. sonnei; and using genome-scale models of metabolism we show that Shigella species display convergent loss of core E. coli metabolic capabilities, with S. sonnei and S. flexneri following a similar trajectory of metabolic streamlining to that of S. dysenteriae. This study highlights the importance of IS to the evolution of Shigella and provides a framework for the investigation of IS dynamics and metabolic reduction in other bacterial species.",

    "abstract": "The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is necessary for appropriate appraisal of stressful information, as well as coordinating visceral and behavioral processes. However, prolonged stress impairs mPFC function and prefrontal-dependent behaviors. Additionally, chronic stress induces sympathetic predominance, contributing to health detriments associated with autonomic imbalance. Previous studies identified a subregion of rodent prefrontal cortex, infralimbic cortex (IL), as a key regulator of neuroendocrine-autonomic integration after chronic stress, suggesting that IL output may prevent chronic stress-induced autonomic imbalance. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that the IL regulates hemodynamic, vascular, and cardiac responses to chronic stress. To address this hypothesis, a viral-packaged siRNA construct was used to knockdown vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGluT1) and reduce glutamate packaging and release from IL projection neurons. Male rats were injected with a vGluT1 siRNA-expressing construct or GFP control into the IL and then remained as unstressed controls or were exposed to chronic variable stress (CVS). IL vGluT1 knockdown increased heart rate and mean arterial pressure (MAP) reactivity, while CVS increased chronic MAP only in siRNA-treated rats. In a separate cohort, CVS and vGluT1 knockdown interacted to impair both endothelial-dependent and endothelial-independent vasoreactivity ex vivo. Furthermore, vGluT1 knockdown and CVS increased histological markers of fibrosis and hypertrophy. Thus, knockdown of glutamate release from IL projection neurons indicates that these cells are necessary to prevent the enhanced physiological responses to stress that promote susceptibility to cardiovascular pathophysiology. Ultimately, these findings provide evidence for a neurobiological mechanism mediating the relationship between stress and poor cardiovascular health outcomes.\\n\\nClinical perspectiveWhat is new?
