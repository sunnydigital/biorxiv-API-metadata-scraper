    "abstract": "Humans are highly skilled at analysing complex acoustic scenes. The segregation of different acoustic streams and the formation of corresponding neural representations is mostly attributed to the auditory cortex. Decoding of selective attention from neuroimaging has therefore focussed on cortical responses to sound. However, the auditory brainstem response to speech is modulated by selective attention as well, as recently shown through measuring the brainstems response to running speech. Although the response of the auditory brainstem has a smaller magnitude than that of the auditory cortex, it occurs at much higher frequencies and therefore has a higher information rate. Here we develop statistical models for extracting the brainstem response from multi-channel scalp recordings and for analysing the attentional modulation according to the focus of attention. We demonstrate that the attentional modulation of the brainstem response to speech can be employed to decode the attentional focus of a listener from short measurements of ten seconds or less in duration. The decoding remains accurate when obtained from three EEG channels only. We further show how out-of-the-box decoding that employs subject-independent models, as well as decoding that is independent of the specific attended speaker is capable of achieving similar accuracy. These results open up new avenues for investigating the neural mechanisms for selective attention in the brainstem and for developing efficient auditory brain-computer interfaces.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning algorithms can be fooled by small well-designed adversarial perturbations. This is reminiscent of cellular decision-making where ligands (called antagonists) prevent correct signalling, like in early immune recognition. We draw a formal analogy between neural networks used in machine learning and models of cellular decision-making (adaptive proofreading). We apply attacks from machine learning to simple decision-making models, and show explicitly the correspondence to antagonism by weakly bound ligands. Such antagonism is absent in more nonlinear models, which inspired us to implement a biomimetic defence in neural networks filtering out adversarial perturbations. We then apply a gradient-descent approach from machine learning to different cellular decision-making models, and we reveal the existence of two regimes characterized by the presence or absence of a critical point for the gradient. This critical point causes the strongest antagonists to lie close to the decision boundary. This is validated in the loss landscapes of robust neural networks and cellular decision-making models, and observed experimentally for immune cells. For both regimes, we explain how associated defence mechanisms shape the geometry of the loss landscape, and why different adversarial attacks are effective in different regimes. Our work connects evolved cellular decision-making to machine learning, and motivates the design of a general theory of adversarial perturbations, both for in vivo and in silico systems.",

    "abstract": "Although light-to-moderate alcohol consumption is considered beneficial, alcohol in binge doses or high cumulative lifetime consumption leads to cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome and structural damage to various organs. Alcohol is known to alter blood lipid concentrations; however, the association of the types of alcohol on the lipid profile has not been investigated extensively. A cross-sectional study involving male participants (n = 86) aged 20 to 60 from the Ranchi and Dhanbad zone of Jharkhand, India, was carried out to investigate the effects of cumulative lifetime consumption of Haria, a local rice-based fermented alcohol, Indian made foreign liquor (IMFL), and a combination of the two on the blood lipid profiles. Demographic characteristics, dietary intake and medical history were obtained from the participants by questionnaire, and lipid levels were determined by analysis of blood samples. The effect of Haria alone on the blood lipids was also investigated on the local female population (n = 31). After adjusting for demographic and dietary factors, IMFL and combination of IMFL and Haria consumption was associated with increased serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels (P < 0.05) and decreased high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels (P < 0.05). None of the blood lipids changed significantly in Haria consumers in both male and female groups. This study suggests that Haria, a popular alcoholic beverage of West Bengal and east-central India, is a relatively safe local alcoholic beverage and does not alter the lipid profile in consumers.",

    "abstract": "Despite many genes associated with human diseases have been identified, disease mechanisms often remain elusive due to the lack of understanding how disease genes are connected functionally at pathways level. Within biological networks, disease genes likely map to modules whose identification facilitates etiology studies but remains challenging. We describe a systematic approach to identify disease-associated gene modules. A gene co-expression network based on the graphical Gaussian model (GGM) was constructed using the GTEx dataset and assembled into 652 gene modules. Screening these modules identified those with disease genes enrichment for obesity, cardiomyopathy, hypertension, and autism, which illuminated the molecular pathways underlying their pathogenesis. Using mammalian phenotypes derived from mouse models, potential disease candidate genes were identified from these modules. Also analyzed were epilepsy, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depressive disorder, revealing shared and distinct disease modules among brain disorders. Thus, disease genes converge on modules within our GGM gene co-expression network, which provides a general framework to dissect genetic architecture of human diseases.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWhen a randomized experimental study is not possible, Mendelian randomization studies use genetic variants or polygenic scores as instrumental variables to control for gene-environment correlation while estimating the association between an exposure and outcome. Polygenic scores have become increasingly potent predictors of their respective phenotypes, satisfying the relevance criteria of an instrumental variable. Evidence for pleiotropy, however, casts doubt on whether the exclusion criteria of an instrumental variable is likely to hold for polygenic scores of complex phenotypes, and a number of methods have been developed to adjust for pleiotropy in Mendelian randomization studies.\\n\\nMethodUsing multiple polygenic scores and path analysis we implement an extension of genetic instrumental variable regression, genetic path analysis, and use it to test whether educational attainment is associated with two health-related outcomes in adulthood, body mass index and smoking initiation, while estimating and controlling for both gene-environment correlations and pleiotropy.\\n\\nResultsGenetic path analysis provides compelling evidence for a complex set of gene-environment transactions that undergird the relations between educational attainment and health-related outcomes in adulthood. Importantly, results are consistent with education having a protective effect on body mass index and smoking initiation, even after controlling for gene-environment correlations and pleiotropy.\\n\\nConclusionsThe proposed method is capable of addressing the exclusion criteria for a sound instrumental variable and, consequently, has the potential to help advance Mendelian randomization studies of complex phenotypes.",

Smith) is a severely destructive pest native to the Americas, but has now become an alien invasive pest in China, and causes significant economic loss. Therefore, in order to make effective management strategies, it is highly essential to understand genomic architecture and its genetic background. In this study, we assembled two chromosome scale genomes of the fall armyworm, representing one male and one female individual procured from Yunnan province of China. The genome sizes were identified as 542.42 Mb with N50 of 14.16 Mb, and 530.77 Mb with N50 of 14.89 Mb for the male and female FAW, respectively. We predicted about 22,201 genes in the male genome. We found the expansion of cytochrome P450 and glutathione s-transferase gene families, which are functionally related to the intensified detoxification and pesticides tolerance. Further population analyses of corn strain (C strain) and rice strain (R strain) revealed that the Chinese fall armyworm was most likely invaded from Africa. These strain information, genome features and possible invasion source described in this study will be extremely important for making effective strategies to manage the fall armyworms.",

Pilin polymerization and depolymerization are powered by motor PilT-like ATPases thought to possess C2 symmetry. However, most PilT-like ATPases crystallize with either C3 or C6 symmetry and the relevance of these conformations is unclear. Here we determined the X-ray structures of PilT in four unique conformations and used these structures to classify the conformation of available PilT-like ATPase structures. Single particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) structures of PilT revealed condition-dependent preferences for C2, C3, and C6 conformations. The physiologic importance of these conformations was validated by co-evolution analysis and functional studies of point mutants, identifying a rare gain-of-function mutation that favours the C2 conformation. With these data we propose a comprehensive model of PilT function with broad implications for PilT-like ATPases.",

Zebrafish larvae swim in punctuated bouts separated by longer periods of rest called interbout intervals. We take advantage of this structure by categorizing bouts into discrete types and representing their behavior as labeled sequences of bout-types emitted over time. We then construct probabilistic models - specifically, marked renewal processes - to evaluate how bout-types and interbout intervals are selected by the fish as a function of its internal hunger state, behavioral history, and the locations and properties of nearby prey. Finally, we evaluate the models by their predictive likelihood and their ability to generate realistic trajectories of virtual fish swimming through simulated environments. Our simulations capture multiple timescales of structure in larval zebrafish behavior and expose many ways in which hunger state influences their action selection to promote food seeking during hunger and safety during satiety.",

Researchers must balance various trade-offs associated with locus length and evolutionary rate among other factors. The most commonly used reduced representation datasets for phylogenomics are ultraconserved elements (UCEs) and Anchored Hybrid Enrichment (AHE). Here, we introduce Rapidly Evolving Long Exon Capture (RELEC), a new set of loci that targets single exons that are both rapidly evolving (evolutionary rate faster than RAG1) and relatively long in length (greater than 1,500 bp), while at the same time avoiding paralogy issues across amniotes. We compare the RELEC dataset to UCEs and AHE in squamate reptiles by aligning and analyzing orthologous sequences from 17 squamate genomes, composed of ten snakes and seven lizards. The RELEC dataset (179 loci) outperforms AHE and UCEs by maximizing per-locus genetic variation while maintaining presence and orthology across a range of evolutionary scales. RELEC markers show higher phylogenetic informativeness than UCE and AHE loci, and RELEC gene trees show greater similarity to the species tree than AHE or UCE gene trees. Furthermore, with fewer loci, RELEC remains computationally tractable for full Bayesian coalescent species tree analyses. We contrast RELEC to and discuss important aspects of comparable methods, and demonstrate how RELEC may be the most effective set of loci for resolving difficult nodes and rapid radiations. We provide several resources for capturing or extracting RELEC loci from other amniote groups.",

Enrichment partially overlaps meiotic double-strand break (DSB) hotspots, but disruption of either topoisomerase has different effects during meiotic recombination. TOP1 disruption delays DSB induction and shortens the window of DSB accumulation by an unknown mechanism. By contrast, temperature-sensitive top2-1 mutants accumulate DSBs on synapsed chromosomes and exhibit a marked delay in meiotic chromosome remodeling. This defect results from a delay in recruiting the meiotic chromosome remodeler Pch2/TRIP13 but, unexpectedly, is not due to a loss of Top2 catalytic activity. Instead, mutant Top2-1 protein has reduced contact with chromatin but remains associated with meiotic chromosomes, and we provide evidence that this altered binding is responsible for the delay in chromosome remodeling. Our results imply independent roles for topoisomerases I and II in modulating meiotic recombination.",

Here, we present PICRUSt2 (https://github.com/picrust/picrust2), which expands the capabilities of the original PICRUSt method1 to predict the functional potential of a community based on marker gene sequencing profiles. This updated method and implementation includes several improvements over the previous algorithm: an expanded database of gene families and reference genomes, a new approach now compatible with any OTU-picking or denoising algorithm, and novel phenotype predictions. Upon evaluation, PICRUSt2 was more accurate than PICRUSt1 and other current approaches overall. PICRUSt2 is also now more flexible and allows the addition of custom reference databases. We highlight these improvements and also important caveats regarding the use of predicted metagenomes, which are related to the inherent challenges of analyzing metagenome data in general.",

A major obstacle is that the rules governing species distribution can change with spatial scale. Here, we illustrate this point using data from a spatially nested metacommunity of parasites infecting a metapopulation of threespine stickleback fish from 34 lakes on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Parasite communities differ among host individuals within each host population and between host populations. The distribution of each parasite taxon depends, to varying degrees, on individual host traits (e.g., mass, diet) and on host population characteristics (e.g., lake size, mean diet). However, in most cases, a given parasite was regulated by different factors at the host-individual and host-population scales, contributing to scale-dependent patterns of parasite-species co-occurrence.",

Most studies with broad-spectrum antibiotics show severe impact on the resistome development of patients. Although narrow-spectrum antibiotics are believed to have less side-effects, their impact on the microbiome and resistome is mostly unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the narrow-spectrum antibiotic phenoxymethylpenicillin (Penicillin V) on the microbiome and resistome of a child treated for acute otitis media (OM).\\n\\nMethodsOral and fecal samples were collected from a one-year child before (day 0) and after (day 5 and 30) receiving Penicillin V against OM. Metagenomic sequencing data was analysed to determine taxonomic profiling, using Kraken and Bracken software, and resistance profiling, using KMA in combination with the ResFinder database.\\n\\nResultsIn the oral samples, 11 antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), belonging to four classes, were identified at baseline. At day 5, the abundance of some ARGs was increased, some remained unchanged, while others disappeared. At day 30, most ARGs had returned to baseline levels, or lower. In the fecal samples we observed seven ARGs at baseline and five at day 5, with only one gene observed at day 5 being present at baseline. At day 30 the number of ARGs increased to 21 ARGs from 7 different classes.\\n\\nConclusionsPenicillin V had a remarkable impact on the fecal resistome indicating that even narrow-pectrum antibiotics may have important consequences in selecting for a more resistant microbiome.",

Here, we explore how two features of vesicle membranes, DNA tethers and phase-segregated membranes, promote fusion between specific vesicle populations. We show that membrane phase-segregation provides an energetic driver for membrane fusion that increases the efficiency of DNA-mediated fusion events. Using this system, we show that orthogonality provided by DNA tethers allows us to direct fusion and delivery of DNA cargo to specific vesicle populations. We then demonstrate that vesicle fusion between DNA-tethered vesicles can be used to initiate in vitro protein expression that leads to the synthesis of model soluble and membrane proteins. The ability to engineer orthogonal fusion events between DNA-tethered vesicles will provide a new strategy to control the spatio-temporal dynamics of cell-free reactions, expanding opportunities to engineer artificial cellular systems.",

In addition, we show that a previously reported dominant disease mutation, K180R, maps to the same multimerization surface. Both mutations disrupt filamentation, suggesting that dominant disease arises from defects in multimer formation. A ytterbium-derivatized structure pinpoints multiple credible calcium sites at filament-forming interfaces, explaining the atomic basis of calsequestrin filamentation in the presence of calcium.

These bacteria belong to the order Pelagibacterales (SAR11) and are related to Pelagibacter (marine SAR11) that dominate many marine habitats. Although a handful of Pelagibacter phage (Pelagiphage) have been described, no phage that infect Fonsibacter have been reported. In this study, a complete Fonsibacter genome containing a prophage was reconstructed from metagenomic data. A circularized and complete genome related to the prophage, referred to as uv-Fonsiphage-EPL, shows high similarity to marine Pelagiphage HTVC025P. Additionally, we reconstructed three complete and one draft genome of phage related to marine Pelagiphage HTVC010P, and predicted a lytic strategy. The similarity in codon usage and co-occurrence patterns of HTVC010P-related phage and Fonsibacter suggested that these phage infect Fonsibacter. Similar phage were detected in Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, where Fonsibacter is also present. A search of related phage revealed the worldwide distribution of some genotypes in freshwater ecosystems, suggesting their substantial role in shaping indigenous microbial assemblages and influence on biogeochemical cycling. However, the uv-Fonsiphage-EPL and one lineage of HTVC010P-related phage have a more limited distribution in freshwater ecosystems. Based on this, and their close phylogenetic relatedness with Pelagiphage, we predict that they transitioned from saline into freshwater ecosystems comparatively recently. Overall, the findings provide insights into the genomic features of phage that infect Fonsibacter, and expand understanding of the ecology and evolution of these important bacteria.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThere is a need for low power, scalable photoelectronic devices and systems for emerging optogenetic needs in neuromodulation. Conventional light emitting diodes (LEDs) are constrained by power and lead-counts necessary for scalability. Organic LEDs (OLEDs) offer an exciting approach to decrease power and lead-counts while achieving high channel counts on thin, flexible substrates that conform to brain surfaces or peripheral neuronal fibers. In this study, we investigate the potential for using OLEDs to modulate neuronal networks cultured in vitro on a transparent microelectrode array (MEA) and subsequently validate neurostimulation in vivo in a transgenic mouse model.\\n\\nApproachCultured mouse cortical neurons were transfected with light-sensitive opsins such as blue-light sensitive channel-rhodopsin (ChR2) and green-light sensitive chimeric channel-rhodopsin (C1V1tt) and stimulated using blue and green OLEDs (with 455 and 520 nm peak emission spectra respectively) at a power of 1 mW/mm2 under pulsed conditions.\\n\\nMain resultsWe demonstrate neuromodulation and optostimulus-locked, single unit-neuronal activity in neurons expressing stimulating and inhibiting opsins (n=4 MEAs, each with 16 recordable channels). We also validated the optostimulus-locked response in a channel-rhodopsin expressing transgenic mouse model, where at least three isolatable single neuronal cortical units respond to OLED stimulation.\\n\\nSignificanceThe above results indicate the feasibility of generating sufficient luminance from OLEDs to perform neuromodulation both in vitro and in vivo. This opens up the possibility of developing thin, flexible OLED films with multiple stimulation sites that can conform to the shape of the neuronal targets in the brain or the peripheral nervous system. However, stability of these OLEDs under chronic conditions still needs to be carefully assessed with appropriate packaging approaches.",

    "abstract": "Membrane neck formation is essential for scission, which, as recent experiments on tubules have demonstrated, can be location dependent. The diversity of biological machinery that can constrict a neck such as dynamin, actin, ESCRTs and BAR proteins, and the range of forces and deflection over which they operate, suggest that the constriction process is functionally mechanical and robust to changes in biological environment. In this study, we used a mechanical model of the lipid bilayer to systematically investigate the influence of location, symmetry constraints, and helical forces on membrane neck constriction. Simulations from our model demonstrated that the energy barriers associated with constriction of a membrane neck are location-dependent. Importantly, if symmetry restrictions are relaxed, then the energy barrier for constriction is dramatically lowered and the membrane buckles at lower values of forcing parameters. Our simulations also show that constriction due to helical proteins further reduces the energy barrier for neck formation compared to cylindrical proteins. These studies establish that despite different molecular mechanisms of neck formation in cells, the mechanics of constriction naturally leads to a loss of symmetry that can lower the energy barrier to constriction.\n\nSignificance statementMembrane tubule constriction is a critical step of cellular membrane trafficking processes and is thought to be mechanically regulated. Mechanical modeling techniques employing the Helfrich Hamiltonian and axisymmetric continuum frameworks have previously described energy barriers to constriction as a function of location along a 26 membrane tubule. Recent advances in numerical modeling using spline basis functions (Isogeometric Analysis) enable us to conduct our analyses of membrane mechanics in a generalized 3D framework. Here, we implement a novel 3D Isogeometric Analysis framework and juxtapose it against an axisymmetric model to study the influence of location, symmetry constraints and helical collars on the constriction pathway. We show that an unsymmetric, \"crushed soda can\" neck consistently displays a lower energy barrier than a symmetric neck.",

Enzymes that catalyze O-GlcNAcylation are found at both presynaptic and postsynaptic sites, and O-GlcNAcylated proteins localize to synaptosomes. An acute increase in O-GlcNAcylation induces long-term depression (LTD) of excitatory transmission at hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses, and depresses hyperexcitable circuits in vitro and in vivo. Yet, no study has investigated how O-GlcNAcylation modulates the efficacy of inhibitory neurotransmission. Here we show an acute increase in O-GlcNAc dampens GABAergic currents onto principal cells in rodent hippocampus likely through a postsynaptic mechanism, and has a variable effect on the excitation/inhibition balance. The overall effect of increased O-GlcNAc is reduced synaptically-driven spike probability via synaptic depression and decreased intrinsic excitability.

Inhibitory interneurons are suggested to promote this synchronization, but it is unclear whether distinct interneuron subtypes provide different contributions. To test this, we examined single-unit recordings from barrel cortex in vivo and used optogenetics to determine the contribution of two classes of inhibitory interneurons: parvalbumin (PV)- and somatostatin (SST)-positive interneurons to spike-timing synchronization across cortical layers. We found that PV interneurons preferentially promote the synchronization of spike-times when instantaneous firing-rates are low (<12 Hz), whereas SST interneurons preferentially promote the synchronization of spike-times when instantaneous firing-rates are high (>12 Hz). Furthermore, using a computational model, we demonstrate that these effects can be explained by PV and SST interneurons having preferential contribution to feedforward and feedback inhibition, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that distinct subtypes of inhibitory interneurons have frequency-selective roles in spatio-temporal synchronization of precise spike-times.",

    "abstract": "An aberrant increase in pluripotency gene (PpG) expression due to enhancer reactivation could induce stemness and enhance tumorigenicity of cancer stem cells. Silencing of PpG enhancers (PpGe) during embryonic stem cell differentiation involves Lsd1-mediated H3K4me1 demethylation and DNA methylation. Here, we observed retention of H3K4me1 and DNA hypomethylation at PpGe associated with a partial repression of PpGs in F9 embryonal carcinoma cells (ECCs) post-differentiation. H3K4me1 demethylation in F9 ECCs could not be rescued by Lsd1 overexpression. Given our observation that H3K4me1 demethylation is accompanied by strong Oct4 repression in P19 ECCs, we tested if Oct4 interaction with Lsd1 affects its catalytic activity. Our data show a dose-dependent inhibition of Lsd1 activity by Oct4 and retention of H3K4me1 at PpGe in Oct4 overexpressing P19 ECCs. These data suggest that Lsd1-Oct4 interaction in cancer stem cells could establish a primed enhancer state that is susceptible to reactivation leading to aberrant PpG expression.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulation is widespread, relatively mild but functionally important. Despite extensive efforts to identify miRNA targets, it remains unclear how miRNAs bind to mRNA targets globally and how changes in miRNA levels affects the transcriptome. Here we apply an optimized method for simultaneously capturing miRNA and targeted RNA sites to wildtype, miRNA knockout and induced epithelial cells. We find that abundantly expressed miRNAs can bind to thousands of different transcripts and many different miRNAs can regulate the same gene. Although mRNA sites that are bound by miRNAs and also contain matches to seed sequences confer the strongest regulation, [~]50% of miRNAs bind to RNA regions without seed matches. In general, these bindings have little impact on mRNA levels and reflect a scanning activity of miRNAs. In addition, different miRNAs have different preferences to seed matches and 3end base-pairing. For a single miRNA, the effectiveness of mRNA regulation is highly correlated with the number of captured miRNA:RNA fragments. Notably, elevated miRNA expression effectively represses existing targets with little impact on newly recognized targets. Global analysis of directly captured mRNA targets reveals pathways that are involved in cancer, cell adhesion and signaling pathways are highly regulated by many different miRNAs in epithelial cells. Comparison between experimentally captured and TargetScan predicted targets indicates that our approach is more effective to identify bona fide targets by reducing false positive and negative predictions. This study reveals the global binding landscape and impact of miRNAs on mammalian transcriptome.",

    "abstract": "Next-generation sequencing has uncovered microRNAs (miRNAs) that undergo sequence modifications, known as isomiRs. Their physiological significance, however, remains uncertain, partly because they generally comprise a small fraction of total miRNAs. Here we report that more than 60% of miR-125b, one of the most abundant miRNAs in vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMC), exists as an edited isoform containing a non-templated adenosine residue at the 3 prime-end (miR-125b+A). The properties of miR-125b+A, such as stability and subcellular localization, are similar to those of canonical miR-125b, but miR-125b+A more potently inhibits the expression of a subgroup of targets, including the apoptosis effector Caspase-6 (CASP6). In the CASP6 transcript, adenylated miR125b preferentially targets a conserved, atypical site, with an unusual 36 nucleotides loop between seed sequence and 3 prime-end supplementary site. PAP associated domain containing 2 (PAPD2) is responsible for monoadenylation of miR-125b. Downregulation of PAPD2 results in the conversion of miR-125b+A to miR-125b, derepression of CASP6, and sensitization of vSMC to apoptotic stimuli. Thus, atypical site recognition by a tissue-specific isomiR fulfills a pro-survival role.",

    "abstract": "Targeted memory reactivation (TMR) during slow-wave oscillations (SWOs) in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep has been demonstrated with sensory cues to achieve about 5-12% improvement in post-nap memory performance on simple laboratory tasks. But prior work has neither addressed the one-shot aspect of episodic memory acquisition, nor dealt with the presence of interference from ambient environmental cues in real-world settings for the sensory cues. Moreover, TMR with sensory cues may not be scalable to the multitude of experiences over ones lifetime. We designed a novel non-invasive paradigm that tags one-shot experiences of minute-long naturalistic episodes within immersive virtual reality (VR) with unique spatiotemporal amplitude-modulated patterns (STAMPs) of transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) and cues them during SWOs. In particular, we demonstrate that these STAMPs can be re-applied as brief pulses to temporally coincide with UP states of SWOs (0.4167 - 1 s) on two consecutive nights to achieve about 20% improvement in the metamemory of targeted episodes at 48 hours after the one-shot viewing, compared to the control episodes. Post-sleep metamemory of the targeted episodes was driven by an interaction between their pre-sleep metamemory and the number of STAMP applications for those episodes during sleep. Overnight metamemory improvements were mediated by spectral power increases from 6.18 to 6.7 s following the offset of STAMPs in the slow-spindle band (9-12 Hz) for left temporal areas in the scalp electroencephalography (EEG) during sleep. These results prescribe an optimal strategy to leverage STAMPs for boosting metamemory and suggest that real-world episodic memories can be modulated in a targeted manner even with coarser, non-invasive spatiotemporal stimulation.",

Bisque implements a regression-based approach that utilizes single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data to generate a reference expression profile and learn gene-specific bulk expression transformations to robustly decompose RNA-seq data. These transformations significantly improve decomposition performance compared to existing methods when there is significant technical variation in the generation of the reference profile and observed bulk expression. Importantly, compared to existing methods, our approach is extremely efficient, making it suitable for the analysis of large genomic datasets that are becoming ubiquitous. When applied to subcutaneous adipose and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex expression datasets with both bulk RNA-seq and single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) data, Bisque was able to replicate previously reported associations between cell type proportions and measured phenotypes across abundant and rare cell types. Bisque requires a single-cell reference dataset that reflects physiological cell type composition and can further leverage datasets that includes both bulk and single cell measurements over the same samples for improved accuracy. We further propose an additional mode of operation that merely requires a set of known marker genes. Bisque is available as an R package at: https://github.com/cozygene/bisque.",

    "abstract": "Chondrocytes are responsible for maintaining the cartilage that helps joints like the knee and hip bear load and move smoothly. These cells typically respond to physiological compression with pathways consistent with matrix synthesis, and chondrocyte mechanotransduction is essential for tissue and joint homeostasis. In osteoarthritis (OA), chondrocyte mechanotransduction appears to be dysregulated, yet many pathways and mechanisms of osteoarthritic chondrocyte mechanotransduction remain poorly understood. The objective of this study is to document the phosphoproteomic responses of primary osteoarthritic chondrocytes to physiological sinusoidal compression. Here we show that OA chondrocytes respond to physiological compression by first activating proteins consistent with cytoskeletal remodeling and decreased transcription, and then later activating proteins for transcription. These results show that several microtubule-related proteins respond to compression, as well as proteins related to calcium signaling, which has previously been extensively shown in chondrocytes. Our results demonstrate that compression is a relevant physiological stimulus for osteoarthritic chondrocytes. We anticipate these data to be a starting point for more sophisticated analysis of both normal and osteoarthritic chondrocyte mechanotransduction. For example, finding differences in compression-induced phosphoproteins between normal and OA cells may lead to druggable targets to restore homeostasis to diseased joints.",

It will enter obligatory pupal diapause in each generation at specific stage, while little is known about the course and the molecular mechanisms of diapause induction. To gain insight into possible mechanisms of obligatory pupal diapause induction, high-throughput RNA-seq data were generated from second-instar larvae (2L), third-instar larvae (3L) and pupal (P, one week after pupating). A total of 116,402 unigenes were assembled and researched against public databases, and 54,781 unigenes matched to proteins in the NCBI database using the BLAST search. Three pairwise comparisons were performed, and significantly differentially regulated transcripts were identified. Several differentially expressed genes (DEGs) expression patterns revealed that those highly or lowly expressed genes in pupal stage were predicted to be involved in diapause induction. Moreover, GO function and KEGG pathway analysis were performed on all DEGs and showed that 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) biosynthesis, insulin signaling pathway, FoxO signaling pathway, cell cycle and metabolism pathway may be related to the obligatory diapause of the Chinese citrus fruit fly. This study provides valuable information about the Chinese citrus fruit fly transcriptome for future gene function research, and contributes to the in-depth elucidation of the molecular regulation mechanism of insect obligatory diapause induction.",

Ubiquitinated neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NIIs) are the neuropathological hallmark of FXTAS. Both sense strand derived CGG repeats and antisense strand derived CCG repeats support non-AUG initiated (RAN) translation of homopolymeric proteins in potentially 6 different reading frames. However, the relative abundance of these proteins in FXTAS brains and their co-localization with each other and NIIs is lacking. Here we describe rater-blinded assessment of immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining with newly generated antibodies to different CGG RAN translation products in FXTAS and control brains as well as co-staining with ubiquitin, p62/SQSTM1, and ubiquilin 2. We find that both FMRpolyG and a second CGG repeat derived RAN translation product, FMRpolyA, accumulate in aggregates in FXTAS brains. FMRpolyG is a near-obligate component of both ubiquitin-positive and p62-positive NIIs in FXTAS, with occurrence of aggregates in 20% of all hippocampal neurons and >90% of all inclusions. A subset of these inclusions also stain positive for the ALS/FTD associated protein ubiquilin 2. Ubiquitinated inclusions and FMRpolyG+ aggregates are rarer in cortex and cerebellum. Intriguingly, FMRpolyG staining is also visible in control neuronal nuclei. In contrast to FMRpolyG, staining for FMRpolyA and CCG antisense derived RAN translation products were less abundant and were infrequent components of FMRpolyG+ inclusions. In conclusion, RAN translated FMRpolyG is a common component of ubiquitin and p62 positive inclusions in FXTAS patient brains.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundReward associations during auditory learning induce cortical plasticity in the primary auditory cortex. A prominent source of such influence is the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which conveys a dopaminergic teaching signal to the primary auditory cortex. It is currently unknown, however, how the VTA circuitry thereby influences cortical frequency information processing and spectral integration. In this study, we therefore investigated the temporal effects of direct optogenetic stimulation of the VTA onto spectral integration in the auditory cortex on a synaptic circuit level by current-source-density analysis in anesthetized Mongolian gerbils.\\n\\nResultsWhile auditory lemniscal input predominantly terminates in the granular input layers III/IV, we found that VTA-mediated modulation of spectral processing is relayed by a different circuit, namely enhanced thalamic inputs to the infragranular layers Vb/VIa. Activation of this circuit yields a frequency-specific gain amplification of local sensory input and enhances corticocortical information transfer, especially in supragranular layers I/II. This effects further persisted over more than 30 minutes after VTA stimulation.\\n\\nConclusionsAltogether, we demonstrate that the VTA exhibits a long-lasting influence on sensory cortical processing via infragranular layers transcending the signaling of a mere reward-prediction error. Our findings thereby demonstrate a cellular and circuit substrate for the influence of reinforcement-evaluating brain systems on sensory processing in the auditory cortex.",

    "abstract": "The majority of the heredity of melanoma remains unexplained, however inherited copy number changes have not yet been systematically studied. The genetic environment is highly relevant to treatment stratification, and new gene discovery is therefore desirable. Using an unbiased whole genome screening approach for copy number we identify here a novel melanoma predisposing factor, familial duplications of gene PPP2R3B, encoding a regulatory unit of critical phosphatase PP2A. Significant correlation between expression of PPP2R3B in tumour tissue and survival in a large melanoma cohort was confirmed, and associated with a non-immunological expression profile. Mechanistically, construction and extensive characterization of a stable, inducible cellular model for PPP2R3B overexpression revealed induction of pigment cell switching towards proliferation and away from migration. Importantly, this was independent of the known microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF)-controlled pigment cell phenotype switch, and was instead driven by uncharacterised gene C21orf91. Bioinformatic studies point to C21orf91as a novel target of MITF, and therefore a potential hub in the control of phenotype switching in melanoma. This study identifies novel germline copy number variants in PPP2R3B predisposing to melanocytic neoplasia, and uncovers a new potential therapeutic target C21orf91 in the control of pigment cell proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Pitch is a fundamental attribute of sounds and yet is not perceived equally by all humans. Absolute pitch (AP) musicians perceive, recognize, and name pitches in absolute terms, whereas relative pitch (RP) musicians, representing the large majority of musicians, perceive pitches in relation to other pitches. In this study, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the neural representations underlying tone listening and tone labeling in a large sample of musicians (n = 105). Participants performed a pitch processing task with a listening and a labeling condition during EEG acquisition. Using a brain-decoding framework, we tested a prediction derived from both theoretical and empirical accounts of AP, namely that the representational similarity of listening and labeling is higher in AP musicians than in RP musicians. Consistent with the prediction, time-resolved single-trial EEG decoding revealed a higher representational similarity in AP musicians during late stages of pitch perception. Time-frequency-resolved EEG decoding further showed that the higher representational similarity was present in oscillations in the theta and beta frequency bands. Supplemental univariate analyses were less sensitive in detecting subtle group differences in the frequency domain. Taken together, the results suggest differences between AP and RP musicians in late pitch processing stages associated with cognition, rather than in early processing stages associated with perception.",

    "abstract": "Evolve and resequence (E&R) experiments, in which artificial selection is imposed on organisms in a controlled environment, are becoming an increasingly accessible tool for studying the genetic basis of adaptation. Previous work has assessed how different experimental design parameters affect the power to detect the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that underlie adaptive responses in such experiments, but so far there has been little exploration of how this power varies with the genetic architecture of the evolving traits. In this study, we use forward simulation to build a realistic model of an E&R experiment in which a quantitative polygenic trait experiences a short, but strong, episode of truncation selection. We study the expected power for QTL detection in such an experiment and how this power is influenced by different aspects of trait architecture, including the number of QTLs affecting the trait, their starting frequencies, effect sizes, clustering along a chromosome, dominance, and epistasis patterns. We show that all of the above parameters can affect allele frequency dynamics at the QTLs and linked loci in complex and often unintuitive ways, and thus influence our power to detect them. One consequence of this is that existing detection methods based on models of independent selective sweeps at individual QTLs often have lower detection power than a simple measurement of allele frequency differences before and after selection. Our findings highlight the importance of taking trait architecture into account in designing studies of molecular adaptation with temporal data. We provide a customizable modeling framework that will enable researchers to easily simulate E&R experiments with different trait architectures and parameters tuned to their specific study system, allowing for assessment of expected detection power and optimization of experimental design.",

    "abstract": "Highly-multiplexed immunohistochemistry (mIHC) enables the staining and quantification of dozens of antigens in a tissue section with single-cell resolution. However, annotating cell populations that differ little in the profiled antigens or for which the antibody panel does not include specific markers is challenging. To overcome this obstacle, we have developed an approach for enriching mIHC images with single-cell RNA-seq data, building upon recent experimental procedures for augmenting single-cell transcriptomes with concurrent antigen measurements. Spatially-resolved Transcriptomics via Epitope Anchoring (STvEA) performs transcriptome-guided annotation of highly-multiplexed cytometry datasets. It increases the level of detail in histological analyses by enabling annotation of subtle cell populations, spatial patterns of transcription, and interactions between cell types. More generally, it enables the systematic annotation of cell populations in cytometry data. We demonstrate the utility of STvEA by uncovering the architecture of poorly characterized cell types in the murine spleen using published highly-multiplexed cytometry and mIHC data.",

    "abstract": "Bae & Luck (2018) reported a study of visual working memory in which the orientation being held in memory was decoded from the scalp distribution of sustained ERP activity and alpha-band EEG oscillations. Decoding accuracy was compared to chance at each point during the delay interval, and a correction for multiple comparisons was applied to find clusters of consecutive above-chance time points that were stronger than would be expected by chance. However, the correction used in that study did not account for the autocorrelation of the noise and may have been overly liberal. Here, we describe a more appropriate correction procedure and apply it to the data from Bae & Luck (2018). We find that the major clusters of time points that were significantly above chance with the original correction procedure remained above chance with the updated correction procedure. However, some minor clusters that were significant with the original procedure were no longer significant with the updated procedure. We recommend that future studies use the updated correction procedure.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTranscription factors (TFs) are proteins that are fundamental to transcription and regulation of gene expression. Each TF may regulate multiple genes and each gene may be regulated by multiple TFs. TFs can act as either activator or repressor of gene expression. This complex network of interactions between TFs and genes underlies many developmental and biological processes and is implicated in several human diseases such as cancer. Hence deciphering the network of TF-gene interactions with information on mode of regulation (activation vs. repression) is an important step toward understanding the regulatory pathways that underlie complex traits. There are many experimental, computational, and manually curated databases of TF-gene interactions. In particular, high-throughput ChIP-Seq datasets provide a large-scale map or transcriptional regulatory interactions. However, these interactions are not annotated with information on context and mode of regulation. Such information is crucial to gain a global picture of gene regulatory mechanisms and can aid in developing machine learning models for applications such as biomarker discovery, prediction of response to therapy, and precision medicine.\\n\\nMethodsIn this work, we introduce a text-mining system to annotate ChIP-Seq derived interaction with such meta data through mining PubMed articles. We evaluate the performance of our system using gold standard small scale manually curated databases.\\n\\nResultsOur results show that the method is able to accurately extract mode of regulation with F-score 0.77 on TRRUST curated interaction and F-score 0.96 on intersection of TRUSST and ChIP-network. We provide a HTTP REST API for our code to facilitate usage.\\n\\nAvailibilitySource code and datasets are available for download on GitHub: https://github.com/samanfrm/modex HTTP REST API: https://watson.math.umb.edu/modex/[type query]",
