    "abstract": "BackgroundGenomic prediction (GP) is used in animal and plant breeding to help identify the best genotypes for selection. One of the most important measures of the effectiveness and reliability of GP in plant breeding is predictive accuracy. An accurate estimate of this measure is thus central to GP. Moreover, regression models are the models of choice for analyzing field trial data in plant breeding. However, models that use the classical likelihood typically perform poorly, often resulting in biased parameter estimates, when their underlying assumptions are violated. This typically happens when data are contaminated with outliers. These biases often translate into inaccurate estimates of heritability and predictive accuracy, compromising the performance of GP. Since phenotypic data are susceptible to contamination, improving the methods for estimating heritability and predictive accuracy can enhance the performance of GP. Robust statistical methods provide an intuitively appealing and a theoretically well justified framework for overcoming some of the drawbacks of classical regression, most notably the departure from the normality assumption. We compare the performance of robust and classical approaches to two recently published methods for estimating heritability and predictive accuracy of GP using simulation of several plausible scenarios of random and block data contamination with outliers and commercial maize and rye breeding datasets.\\n\\nResultsThe robust approach generally performed as good as or better than the classical approach in phenotypic data analysis and in estimating the predictive accuracy of heritability and genomic prediction under both the random and block contamination scenarios. Notably, it consistently outperformed the classical approach under the random contamination scenario. Analyses of the empirical maize and rye datasets further reinforce the stability and reliability of the robust approach in the presence of outliers or missing data.\\n\\nConclusionsThe proposed robust approach enhances the predictive accuracy of heritability and genomic prediction while alleviating the need for performing outlier detection for a broad range of simulation scenarios and empirical breeding datasets. Accordingly, plant breeders should seriously consider regularly using the robust alongside the classical approach and increasing the number of replicates to three or more, to further enhance the accuracy of the robust approach.",

    "abstract": "To develop vaccines it is mandatory yet challenging to account for inter-individual variability during immune responses. Even in laboratory mice, T cell responses of single individuals exhibit a high heterogeneity that may come from genetic backgrounds, intra-specific processes (e.g. antigen-processing and presentation) and immunization protocols.\n\nTo account for inter-individual variability in CD8 T cell responses in mice, we propose a dynamical model coupled to a statistical, nonlinear mixed effects model. Average and individual dynamics during a CD8 T cell response are characterized in different immunization contexts (vaccinia virus and tumor). On one hand, we identify biological processes that generate inter-individual variability (activation rate of naive cells, the mortality rate of effector cells, and dynamics of the immunogen). On the other hand, introducing categorical covariates to analyze two different immunization regimens, we highlight the steps of the response impacted by immunogens (priming, differentiation of naive cells, expansion of effector cells and generation of memory cells). The robustness of the model is assessed by confrontation to new experimental data.\n\nOur approach allows to investigate immune responses in various immunization contexts, when measurements are scarce or missing, and contributes to a better understanding of inter-individual variability in CD8 T cell immune responses.",

    "abstract": "Children and youth are at a greater risk of concussions than adults, and once injured, take longer to recover. A key feature of concussion is a diffuse increase in functional connectivity; yet it remains unclear how changes in functional connectivity relate to the patterns of information flow within resting state networks following concussion and how these relate to brain function. We applied a data-driven measure of directed effective brain connectivity to compare the patterns of information flow in healthy adolescents and adolescents with subacute concussion during the resting state condition. Data from 32 healthy adolescents (mean age =16 years) and 24 concussed adolescents (mean age = 13.8 years) with subacute concussion (< 3 months post injury) took part in the study. Five minutes of resting state data EEG were collected while participants sat quietly with their eyes closed. We applied the Kleeman-Liang information flow rate to measure the transfer of information between the EEG time series of each individual at different source locations, and therefore between different brain regions. Based on the ensemble means of the magnitude of normalized information flow rate, our analysis shows that information flow in the healthy adolescents is characterized by a predominantly (L) lateralized pattern with bidirectional information flow between frontal regions, between frontal and central/temporal regions and between parietal and occipital regions. In contrast, adolescents with concussion show distinct differences in information flow marked by a more symmetrical pattern with connections evenly distributed across the entire brain, increased information flow in the posterior regions of the brain and the emergence of bidirectional, inter-hemispheric connections between the left and right temporal regions of the brain. We also find that the statistical distribution of the normalized information flow rates in each group (control and concussed) is significantly different. Our results are the first to describe altered patterns of information flow in adolescents with concussion as well as differences in the statistical distribution of information flow rate. We hypothesize that the observed changes in information flow in the concussed group are a consequence of the brain injury and indicate functional reorganization of resting state networks.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FOG) is a devastating motor symptom of Parkinsons disease that leads to falls, reduced mobility, and decreased quality of life. Reliably eliciting FOG has been difficult in the clinical setting, which has limited discovery of pathophysiology and/or documentation of the efficacy of treatments, such as different frequencies of subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN DBS). In this study we validated an instrumented gait task, the turning and barrier course (TBC), with the international standard FOG questionnaire question 3 (FOG-Q3, r = 0.74, p < 0.001). The TBC is easily assembled and mimics real-life environments that elicit FOG. People with Parkinsons disease who experience FOG (freezers) spent more time freezing during the TBC compared to during forward walking (p = 0.007). Freezers also exhibited greater arrhythmicity during non-freezing gait when performing the TBC compared to forward walking (p = 0.006); this difference in gait arrhythmicity between tasks was not detected in non-freezers or controls. Freezers non-freezing gait was more arrhythmic than that of non-freezers or controls during all walking tasks (p < 0.05). A logistic regression model determined that a combination of gait arrhythmicity, stride time, shank angular range, and asymmetry had the greatest probability of classifying a step as FOG (area under receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.754). Freezers percent time freezing and non-freezing gait arrhythmicity decreased, and their shank angular velocity increased in the TBC during both 60 Hz and 140 Hz STN DBS (p < 0.05) to non-freezer values. The TBC is a standardized tool for eliciting FOG and demonstrating the efficacy of 60 Hz and 140 Hz STN DBS for gait impairment and FOG. The TBC revealed gait parameters that differentiated freezers from non-freezers and best predicted FOG; these may serve as relevant control variables for closed loop neurostimulation for FOG in Parkinsons disease.",

Rats were divided into three groups: group 1 as normal, group 2 as diabetic control and group 3 were given PTAB upto 14 days. Blood glucose and liver function tests were done using their respective kits. Hematoxylene and eosin staining was done to evaluate the morphological changes in liver tissues.

As compared to diabetic control, PTAB decreases SGOT, SGPT and alkaline phosphates after 14 days of treatment. In diabetic control, the morphology of liver tissues were found damaged due to deformed hepatocytes and dilated lobules. Most of the hepatocytes after PTAB treatment were comparatively found similar to normal rats tissues, along with dilated blood vessels and normalized liver lobules. In addition to these results, PTAB suppresses the expressions of VEGF and MMP 9.\\n\\nConclusionPTAB was found to act as an effective hypoglycemic agent. In addition to this, PTAB also found to inhibit inflammation and apoptosis of liver. Thus, can be taken as a potential drug in liver diseases.",

    "abstract": "The microbial communities thriving at the root-soil interface have the potential to improve plant growth and sustainable crop production. Yet, how agricultural practices, such as the application of either mineral or organic nitrogen fertilisers, impact on the composition and functions of these communities remains to be fully elucidated. By deploying a two-pronged 16S rRNA gene sequencing and predictive metagenomics approach we demonstrated that the bacterial microbiota of field-grown tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants is the product of a selective process that progressively differentiates between rhizosphere and root microhabitats. This process initiates as early as plants are in a nursery stage and it is then more marked at late developmental stages, in particular at harvest. This selection acts on both the bacterial relative abundances and phylogenetic assignments, with a bias for the enrichment of members of the phylum Actinobacteria in the root compartment. Digestate-based and mineral-based nitrogen fertilisers trigger a distinct bacterial enrichment in both rhizosphere and root microhabitats. This compositional diversification mirrors a predicted functional diversification of the root-inhabiting communities, manifested predominantly by the differential enrichment of genes associated to ABC transporters and the two-component system. Together, our data suggest that the microbiota thriving at the tomato root-soil interface is modulated by and in responses to the type of nitrogen fertiliser applied to the field.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWDating population divergence within species from molecular data and relating such dating to climatic and biogeographic changes is not trivial. Yet it can help formulating evolutionary hypotheses regarding local adaptation and future responses to changing environments. Key issues include statistical selection of a demographic and historical scenario among a set of possible scenarios, and estimation of the parameter(s) of interest under the chosen scenario. Such inferences greatly benefit from new statistical approaches including approximate Bayesian computation - Random Forest (ABC-RF), the latter providing reliable inference at a low computational cost, with the possibility to take into account prior knowledge on both biogeographical history and genetic markers. Here, we used ABC-RF, including independent information on evolutionary rate and pattern at microsatellite markers, to decipher the evolutionary history of the African arid-adapted pest locust, Schistocerca gregaria. We found that the evolutionary processes that have shaped the present geographical distribution of the species in two disjoint northern and southern regions of Africa were recent, dating back 2.6 Ky (90% CI: 0.9 - 6.6 Ky). ABC-RF inferences also supported a southern colonization of Africa from a low number of founders of northern origin. The inferred divergence history is better explained by the peculiar biology of S. gregaria, which involves a density-dependent swarming phase with some exceptional spectacular migrations, rather than a continuous colonization resulting from the continental expansion of open vegetation habitats during more ancient Quaternary glacial climatic episodes.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate effects of FMT on the gut microbiota composition in healthy volunteers and to track long-term changes.\\n\\nResultsWe have performed a combined analysis of three healthy volunteers before and after FMT with frozen capsules, followed by evaluation of their general condition, adverse clinical effects, changes of basic laboratory parameters, and several immune markers.

The data analysis demonstrated the profound shift towards the donor microbiota taxonomic composition in all volunteers. Following FMT, all the volunteers exhibited gut colonization with donor gut bacteria, and persistence of this effect for almost ~1 year of observation. Transient changes of immune parameters were consistent with suppression of T-cell cytotoxicity. FMT was well tolerated with mild gastrointestinal adverse events and systemic inflammatory response in one volunteer.\\n\\nConclusionsThe FMT procedure leads to significant long-term changes of the gut microbiota in healthy volunteers with the shift towards donor microbiota composition, being relatively safe to the recipients without long-term adverse events.",

    "abstract": "A key challenge in understanding stories and conversations is the comprehension of  anaphora, words that refer back to previously mentioned words or concepts ( antecedents). In psycholinguistic theories, anaphor comprehension involves the initial activation of the antecedent and its subsequent integration into the unfolding representation of the narrated event. A recent proposal suggests that these processes draw upon the brains recognition memory and language networks, respectively, and may be dissociable in patterns of neural oscillatory synchronization (Nieuwland & Martin, 2017). We addressed this proposal in an electroencephalogram (EEG) study with pre-registered data acquisition and analyses, using event-related potentials (ERPs) and neural oscillations. Dutch participants read two-sentence mini stories containing proper names, which were repeated or new (ease of activation) and coherent or incoherent with the preceding discourse (ease of integration). Repeated names elicited lower N400 and Late Positive Component amplitude than new names, and also an increase in theta-band (4-7 Hz) synchronization, which was largest around 240-450 ms after name onset. Discourse-coherent proper names elicited an increase in gamma-band (60-80 Hz) synchronization compared to discourse-incoherent names. This effect was largest around 690-1000 ms after name onset and was localized to the left frontal cortex. We argue that the initial activation and subsequent discourse-level integration of referents can be dissociated with event-related EEG activity, and are associated with respectively theta- and gamma-band activity. These findings further establish the link between memory and language through neural oscillations.",

    "abstract": "Humans and other animals are frequently near-optimal in their ability to integrate noisy and ambiguous sensory data to form robust percepts, which are informed both by sensory evidence and by prior experience about the causal structure of the environment. It is hypothesized that the brain establishes these structures using an internal model of how the observed patterns can be generated from relevant but unobserved causes. In dynamic environments, such integration often takes the form of postdiction, wherein later sensory evidence affects inferences about earlier percepts. As the brain must operate in current time, without the luxury of acausal propagation of information, how does such postdictive inference come about? Here, we propose a general framework for neural probabilistic inference in dynamic models based on the distributed distributional code (DDC) representation of uncertainty, naturally extending the underlying encoding to incorporate implicit probabilistic beliefs about both present and past. We show that, as in other uses of the DDC, an inferential model can be learned efficiently using samples from an internal model of the world. Applied to stimuli used in the context of psychophysics experiments, the framework provides an online and plausible mechanism for inference, including postdictive effects.",

    "abstract": "Klinefelter syndrome (KS; 47, XXY) and Turner syndrome (TS; 45, XO) are caused by two relatively common sex chromosome aneuploidies. These conditions are associated with an increased odds of neuropsychiatric disorders, including attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as well as impairments in cognition that include learning delays, attentional dysfunction and impulsivity. We studied cognitive functions in the XY* mouse model, which allows comparison of XXY to XY males (KS model), and XO to XX females (TS model). We evaluated adult mice with and without gonads, using a version of an operant reversal-learning task (RLT) that can be used to measure various facets of learning, impulsivity and attention. In the KS model, only one measure related to impulsivity - perseverative responding under reversal conditions - reliably discriminated gonadally intact XXY and XY mice. In contrast, a fundamental learning impairment (more trials to criterion in acquisition phase) in XXY mice, as compared to XY, was observed in gonadectomized subjects. No other task measures showed differences consistent with KS. In the TS mouse model, XO mice did not show a pattern of results consistent with TS, similar to past observations. Thus, the application of this RLT to these XY* models reveals only limited behavioral impairments relevant to KS.",

    "abstract": "The recruitment of leukocyte to high endothelium venules and their migration to the lymph nodes are critical steps to initiate an immune response. Cell migration is regulated by the actin cytoskeleton where myosins have a very import role. Myo1e is a long tail class I myosin highly expressed in B cells that not have been studied in the context of cell migration. By using an in vivo model, through the use of intravital microscopy, we demonstrated the relevance of Myo1e in the adhesion and the migration of B cells in high endothelial venules. These observations were confirmed by in vitro experiments. We also registered a reduction in the expression of integrins and F-actin in the protrusion of B lymphocytes membrane. Deficiencies in vesicular trafficking can explain the decrease of integrins on the surface. Interestingly, Myo1e is associated with focal adhesion kinase (FAK). The lack of Myo1e affected the phosphorylation of FAK and AKT, and the activity of RAC-1, disturbing the FAK/PI3K/RAC-1 signaling pathway. Together, our results indicate critical participation of Myo1e in the mechanism of B cell migration.\\n\\nSummary statementMyo1e participate in the adhesion and migration in the high endothelial venules by regulation of integrins and the PI3K/FAK/RAC-1 signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "How does the brain represent the reliability of its sensory evidence? Here, we test whether sensory uncertainty is encoded in cortical population activity as the width of a probability distribution - a hypothesis that lies at the heart of Bayesian models of neural coding. We probe the neural representation of uncertainty by capitalizing on a well-known behavioral bias called serial dependence. Human observers of either sex reported the orientation of stimuli presented in sequence, while activity in visual cortex was measured with fMRI. We decoded probability distributions from population-level activity and found that serial dependence effects in behavior are consistent with a statistically advantageous sensory integration strategy, in which uncertain sensory information is given less weight. More fundamentally, our results suggest that probability distributions decoded from human visual cortex reflect the sensory uncertainty that observers rely on in their decisions, providing critical evidence for Bayesian theories of perception.",

    "abstract": "Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) plays an essential role in development by catalysing trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), resulting in gene repression. PRC2 consists of two sub-complexes, PRC2.1 and PRC2.2, in which the PRC2 core associates with distinct ancillary subunits such as MTF2 and JARID2, respectively. Both MTF2, present in PRC2.1, and JARID2, present in PRC2.2, play a role in core PRC2 recruitment to target genes in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). However, it remains unclear how these distinct sub-complexes cooperate to establish Polycomb domains. Here, we combine a range of Polycomb mutant mESCs with chemical inhibition of PRC2 catalytic activity, to systematically dissect their relative contributions to PRC2 binding to target loci. We find that PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 mediate two distinct paths for recruitment, with mutually reinforced binding. Part of the cross-talk between PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 occurs via their catalytic product H3K27me3, which is bound by the PRC2 core-subunit EED, thereby mediating a positive feedback. Strikingly, removal of either JARID2 or H3K27me3 only has a minor effect on PRC2 recruitment, whereas their combined ablation largely attenuates PRC2 recruitment. This strongly suggests an unexpected redundancy between JARID2 and EED-H3K27me3-mediated recruitment of PRC2. Furthermore, we demonstrate that all core PRC2 recruitment occurs through the combined action of MTF2-mediated recruitment of PRC2.1 to DNA and PRC1-mediated recruitment of JARID2-containing PRC2.2. Both axes of binding are supported by EED-H3K27me3 positive feedback, but to a different degree. Finally, we provide evidence that PRC1 and PRC2 mutually reinforce reciprocal binding. Together, these data disentangle the interdependent and cooperative interactions between Polycomb complexes that are important to establish Polycomb repression at target sites.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LISystematic analysis of Polycomb complex binding to target loci in mESCs using null mutations and chemical inhibition.\\nC_LIO_LIPRC1, PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 are all mutually dependent for binding to chromatin, mediated in part by H3K27me3.\\nC_LIO_LIPRC2.1 recruitment is dependent on MTF2\\nC_LIO_LIPRC2.2 recruitment by JARID2 is dependent on PRC1 and largely redundant with recruitment by H3K27me3\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The ability to perform de novo protein design will allow researchers to expand the variety of available proteins. By designing synthetic structures computationally, they can utilise more structures than those available in the Protein Data Bank, design structures that are not found in nature, or direct the design of proteins to acquire a specific desired structure. While some researchers attempt to design proteins from first physical and thermodynamic principals, we decided to attempt to test whether it is possible to perform de novo helical protein design of just the backbone statistically using machine learning by building a model that uses a long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture. The LSTM model used only the{phi} and{psi} angles of each residue from an augmented dataset of only helical protein structures. Though the networks generated backbone structures were not perfect, they were idealised and evaluated post generation where the non-ideal structures were filtered out and the adequate structures kept. The results were successful in developing a logical, rigid, compact, helical protein backbone topology. This paper is a proof of concept that shows it is possible to generate a novel helical backbone topology using an LSTM neural network architecture using only the{phi} and{psi} angles as features. The next step is to attempt to use these backbone topologies and sequence design them to form complete protein structures.\n\nAuthor summaryThis research project stemmed from the desire to expand the pool of protein structures that can be used as scaffolds in computational vaccine development, since the number of structures available from the Protein Data Bank was not sufficient to allow for great diversity and increase the probability of grafting a target motif onto a protein scaffold. Since a protein structures backbone can be defined by the{phi} and{psi} angles of each amino acid in the polypeptide and can effectively translate a proteins 3D structure into a table of numbers, and since protein structures are not random, this numerical representation of protein structures can be used to train a neural network to mathematically generalise what a protein structure is, and therefore generate new a protein backbone. Instead of using all proteins in the Protein Data Bank a curated dataset was used encompassing protein structures with specific characteristics that will, theoretically, allow them to be evaluated computationally. This paper details how a trained neural network was able to successfully generate helical protein backbones.",

    "abstract": "Formins are one of the central players in the assembly of most actin networks in cells. The sensitivity of these processive molecular machines to mechanical tension is now well established. However, how the activity of formins is affected by geometrical constraints related to network architecture, such as filament crosslinking and formin spatial confinement, remains largely unknown. Combining microfluidics and micropatterning, we reconstituted in vitro mDia1 formin-elongated filament bundles induced by fascin, with different geometrical constraints on the formins, and measured the impact of these constraints on formin elongation rates and processivity. When filaments are not bundled, formins can be anchored to static or fluid surfaces, by either end of the proteins, without affecting their activity. We show that filament bundling by fascin reduces both unanchored formin elongation rate and processivity. Strikingly, when filaments elongated by surface-anchored formins are cross-linked together, formin elongation rate immediately decreases and processivity is reduced, up to 24-fold, depending on the cumulative impact of formin rotational and translational freedoms. Our results reveal an unexpected crosstalk between the constraints at the filament and the formin levels. We anticipate that in cells, the molecular details of formin anchoring to the plasma membrane, strongly modulate formin activity at actin filament barbed ends.",

    "abstract": "The TrkB receptor is critical for the control of energy balance, as mutations in its gene (NTRK2) lead to hyperphagia and severe obesity in humans and mice. The main neural substrate mediating the appetite-suppressing activity of TrkB, however, remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that selective Ntrk2 deletion within the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) leads to severe hyperphagic obesity. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation or inhibition of TrkB-expressing PVH (PVHTrkB) neurons suppresses or increases food intake, respectively. PVHTrkB neurons project to multiple brain regions, including the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) and the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN). We found that PVHTrkB neurons projecting to LPBN are distinct from those projecting to VMH, yet Ntrk2 deletion in PVH neurons projecting to either VMH or LPBN results in hyperphagia and obesity. Therefore, TrkB signaling is a key regulator of a previously uncharacterized and heterogenous neuronal population within the PVH that impinges upon multiple circuits to govern appetite.",
