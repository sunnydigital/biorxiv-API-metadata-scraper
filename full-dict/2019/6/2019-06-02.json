    "abstract": "Phenomics is an emerging branch of modern biology that uses high throughput phenotyping tools to capture multiple environmental and phenotypic traits, often at massive spatial and temporal scales. The resulting high dimensional data represent a treasure trove of information for providing an in-depth understanding of how multiple factors interact and contribute to the overall growth and behavior of different genotypes. However, computational tools that can parse through such complex data and aid in extracting plausible hypotheses are currently lacking. In this paper, we present Hyppo-X, a new algorithmic approach to visually explore complex phenomics data and in the process characterize the role of environment on phenotypic traits. We model the problem as one of unsupervised structure discovery, and use emerging principles from algebraic topology and graph theory for discovering higher-order structures of complex phenomics data. We present an open source software which has interactive visualization capabilities to facilitate data navigation and hypothesis formulation. We test and evaluate Hyppo-X on two real-world plant (maize) data sets. Our results demonstrate the ability of our approach to delineate divergent subpopulation-level behavior. Notably, our approach shows how environmental factors could influence phenotypic behavior, and how that effect varies across different genotypes and different time scales. To the best of our knowledge, this effort provides one of the first approaches to systematically formalize the problem of hypothesis extraction for phenomics data. Considering the infancy of the phenomics field, tools that help users explore complex data and extract plausible hypotheses in a data-guided manner will be critical to future advancements in the use of such data.",

    "abstract": "Mathematical frameworks circumventing the need of mechanistic detail to build models of signal transduction networks include graphs, hypergraphs, Boolean Networks, and Petri Nets. Predicting how a signal transduces in a signaling network is essential to understand cellular functions and disease. Different formalisms exist to describe how a signal transduces in a given intracellular signaling network represented in the aforementioned modeling frameworks: elementary signaling modes, T-invariants, extreme pathway analysis, elementary flux modes, and simple paths. How do these formalisms compare?\\n\\nWe present an overview of how signal transduction networks have been modelled using graphs, hypergraphs, Boolean Networks, and Petri Nets in the literature. We provide a review of the different formalisms for capturing signal transduction in a given model of an intracellular signaling network. We also discuss the existing translations between the different modeling frameworks, and the relationships between their corresponding signal transduction representations that have been described in the literature. Furthermore, as a new formalism of signal transduction, we show how minimal functional routes proposed for signaling networks modeled as Boolean Networks can be captured by computing topological factories, a methodology found in the metabolic networks literature. We further show that in the case of signaling networks represented with an acyclic B-hypergraph structure, the definitions are equivalent. In signaling networks represented as directed graphs, it has been shown that computations of elementary modes via its incidence matrix correspond to computations of simple paths and feedback loops. We show that computing elementary modes based on the incidence matrix of a B-hypergraph fails to capture minimal functional routes.",

We found no evidence for within-subject effects of progesterone, estradiol, their interaction or ratio, testosterone, or cortisol on anxious jealousy.

    "abstract": "Integrins V{beta}3 and 5{beta}1 play critical roles in tumor survival, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis and are validated targets for cancer therapy and molecular imaging. Increasing evidence suggests that targeting both integrins simultaneously with antagonists is more effective in cancer therapy because of concerns about resistance and paradoxical promotion of tumor growth with use of agents highly selective for a single integrin. Engineered Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-containing 3.5 kDa cysteine-knot proteins (knottins 2.5F and 2.5D) are attractive drug candidates due to their exceptional structural stability and high affinity binding to certain integrins. 2.5F binds both V{beta}3 and 5{beta}1, whereas 2.5D is V{beta}3-selective. To elucidate the structural basis of integrin selection, we determined the structures of 2.5F and 2.5D both as apo-proteins and in complex with V{beta}3. These data, combined with MD simulations and mutational studies, revealed a critical role of two V{beta}3-specific residues in the vicinity of the metal ion dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) in promoting an V{beta}3-induced fit of 2.5D. In contrast, conformational selection accounted for the specificity of 2.5F to both integrins. These data provide new insights into the structural basis of integrin-ligand binding specificity, and could help in development of integrin-targeted therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Typical brittle stars have five radially symmetrical arms, which coordinate to move their body in a certain direction. However, some species of them show individual difference in the number of arms. We found this trait unique since intact legged animals each own a fixed number of limbs in general. How does a single species manage such different numbers of motile organs to realize adaptive locomotion? We here described four-, five-, six-, and seven-armed locomotion with the aim to generalize a common rule which is flexible with arm numbers in brittle stars. We mechanically stimulated an arm in Ophiactis brachyaspis to analyze escape direction and arm movements. Gathering quantitative indices and employing Bayesian statistical modeling, we figured out an average locomotion: regardless of the total number of arms, a front position emerges at one of the second neighboring arms to a mechanically stimulated arm, while side arms adjacent to the front synchronously work as left and right rowers. We suggest a model where some afferent signal runs either clockwise or anticlockwise along the nerve ring while linearly counting how many arms it passes. This idea would explain how  left and right emerges in a radially symmetrical body via a decentralized system.",

Here, we use deep learning to interrogate and predict antigen-specificity from a massively diverse sequence space to identify globally optimized antibody variants. Using a mammalian display platform and the therapeutic antibody trastuzumab, rationally designed site-directed mutagenesis libraries are introduced by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR). Screening and deep sequencing of relatively small libraries (104) produced high quality data capable of training deep neural networks that accurately predict antigen-binding based on antibody sequence. Deep learning is then used to predict millions of antigen binders from an in silico library of ~108 variants, where experimental testing of 30 randomly selected variants showed all 30 retained antigen specificity. The full set of in silico predicted binders is then subjected to multiple developability filters, resulting in thousands of highly-optimized lead candidates. With its scalability and capacity to interrogate high-dimensional protein sequence space, deep learning offers great potential for antibody engineering and optimization.",

    "abstract": "Genetic tools are critical to dissecting the mechanisms governing cellular processes, from fundamental physiology to pathogenesis. Members of the genus Burkholderia have potential for biotechnological applications but can also cause disease in humans with a debilitated immune system. The lack of suitable genetic tools to edit Burkholderia GC-rich genomes has hampered the exploration of useful capacities and the understanding of pathogenic features. To address this, we have developed CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) technology for gene silencing in Burkholderia, testing it in B. cenocepacia, B. multivorans and B. thailandensis. Tunable expression was provided by placing a codon-optimized dcas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes under control of a rhamnose-inducible promoter. As a proof of concept, the paaABCDE operon controlling genes necessary for phenylacetic acid degradation was targeted by plasmid-borne sgRNAs, resulting in near complete inhibition of growth on phenylacetic acid as the sole carbon source. This was supported by reductions in paaA mRNA expression. The utility of CRISPRi to probe other functions at the single cell level was demonstrated by knocking down phbC and fliF, which dramatically reduces polyhydroxybutyrate granule accumulation and motility, respectively. As a hallmark of the mini-CTX system is the broad host-range of integration, we putatively identified 67 genera of Proteobacteria that might be amenable to modification with our CRISPRi toolkit. Our CRISPRi tool kit provides a simple and rapid way to silence gene expression to produce an observable phenotype. Linking genes to functions with CRISPRi will facilitate genome editing with the goal of enhancing biotechnological capabilities while reducing Burkholderias pathogenic arsenal.\\n\\nAuthor contributionsSTC conceived the idea and design of the research; AMH designed and cloned the dCas9 constructs; AMH and ASMZ designed the sgRNAs, assessed knockdown phenotypes, processed data, and wrote and edited the manuscript; TJL performed RT-qPCR analysis and edited the manuscript; STC supervised the work and provided financial support.\\n\\nGraphical Abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=77 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/618413v3_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (22K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b00aa5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18ae038org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@86af96org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@71bac4_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

However, the effects of the NMDA partial agonist d-cycloserine on psychological treatment have been mixed. We investigated potential neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the clinical effects of d-cycloserine-augmented exposure, to inform the optimal combination of this and similar agents with psychological treatment.\n\nMethodsUnmedicated patients with panic disorder were randomised to single-dose d-cycloserine (250mg; N=17) or matching placebo (N=16) 2hrs before one session of exposure therapy. Neurocognitive markers were assessed one day after treatment, including reaction-time based threat bias for fearful faces and amygdala response to threat. Clinical symptom severity was measured using self-report and clinician-rated scales the day before and after treatment, and at 1- and 6-months follow-up. Analysis was by intention-to-treat.\n\nResultsOne day after treatment, threat bias for fearful faces and amygdala threat response were attenuated in the drug compared to the placebo group. Lower amygdala magnitude predicted greater clinical improvement during follow-up across groups. D-cycloserine led to greater clinical recovery at 1-month follow-up (d-cycloserine 71% versus placebo 25%).\n\nDiscussionD-cycloserine-augmented single-session exposure therapy reduces amygdala threat response, and this effect predicts later clinical response. These findings highlight a neurocognitive mechanism by which d-cycloserine may exert its augmentative effects on psychological treatment and bring forward a marker that may help understand and facilitate future development of adjunct treatments with CBT for anxiety disorders.

This pathway supports cancer initiation, cancer progression and chemoresistance and thus is an attractive target. As developing HSF1 inhibitors is challenging, the identification and targeting of upstream regulators of HSF1 presents a tractable alternative strategy. Here we demonstrate that in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, the dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase 2 (DYRK2) phosphorylates HSF1, promoting its nuclear stability and transcriptional activity. Thus, DYRK2 depletion reduces HSF1 activity and sensitises TNBC cells to proteotoxic stress. Importantly, in tumours from TNBC patients, DYRK2 levels positively correlate with active HSF1 and associates with poor prognosis, suggesting that DYRK2 could be promoting TNBC. In agreement with this, DYRK2 depletion reduces tumour growth in a TNBC xenograft model. These findings identify DYRK2 as both, a key modulator of the HSF1 transcriptional program, and a potential therapeutic target.",

Both rhythms displayed effector-specific modulations, tracked spectral markers of action potentials in the local neuronal population, and showed spatially systematic phase relationships (traveling waves). Yet, alpha- and beta-band rhythms differed in their anatomical and functional properties, were weakly correlated, and traveled along opposite directions across the sensorimotor cortex. Increased alpha-band power in the somatosensory cortex ipsilateral to the selected arm was associated with spatially-unspecific inhibition. Decreased beta-band power over contralateral motor cortex was associated with a focal shift from relative inhibition to excitation. These observations indicate the relevance of both inhibition and disinhibition mechanisms for precise spatiotemporal coordination of neuronal populations during movement selection. Those mechanisms are implemented through the substantially different neurophysiological properties of sensorimotor alpha- and beta-band rhythms.",

In the context of cancer therapeutics, plasticity refers to transient fluctuations in the molecular state of tumor cells, driving the formation of rare cells primed to survive drug treatment and ultimately reprogram into a stably resistant fate. However, the biological processes governing this cellular plasticity remain unknown. We used CRISPR/Cas9 genetic screens to reveal genes that affect cell fate decisions by altering cellular plasticity across a range of functional categories. We found that cellular plasticity and cell fate decision making can be decoupled in that factors can affect cell fate decisions in both plasticity-dependent and independent manners. We discovered a novel mode of altering resistance based on cellular plasticity that, contrary to known mechanisms, pushes cells towards a more differentiated state. We further confirmed our prediction that manipulating cellular plasticity before the addition of the main therapy would result in changes in therapy resistance more than concurrent administration. Together, our results indicate that identifying pathways modulating cellular plasticity has the potential to alter cell fate decisions and may provide a new avenue for treating drug resistance.",

SOX17 directly regulates TFAP2C, PRDM1 and PRDM14, thereby maintaining latent pluripotency and supressing somatic differentiation. In contrast, in somatic cells canonical motifs are not bound by SOX17. In sum only 11% of SOX17 binding sites overlap in seminoma-like and somatic cells. This illustrates that binding site choice is highly dynamic and cell type specific. Deletion of SOX17 in seminoma-like cells resulted in loss of pluripotency, marked by a reduction of OCT4 protein level and loss of alkaline phosphatase activity. Further, we found that in EC-like cells SOX2 regulates pluripotency-associated genes, predominantly by partnering with OCT4. In conclusion, SOX17 (in seminomas) functionally replaces SOX2 (in ECs) to maintain expression of the pluripotency cluster.",

    "abstract": "Age-related cognitive decline arises from alterations in brain integrity as well as in sleep-wake regulation. Here, we investigated whether preserved sleep-wake regulation of cortical function during wakefulness could represent a positive factor for cognitive fitness in aging, independently of early age-related changes in brain structure. We quantified cortical excitability dynamics during prolonged wakefulness as a sensitive marker of age-related alteration in sleep-wake regulation in 60 healthy older individuals (50-69y; 42 women). Brain structural integrity was assessed with amyloid-beta- and tau-PET, and with MRI. Participants cognition was extensively investigated. We show that individuals with preserved cortical excitability dynamics exhibit better cognitive performance, particularly in the executive domain, which is essential to successful cognitive aging. Critically, this association remained significant after accounting for brain integrity measures. Preserved dynamics of basic brain function during wakefulness could be essential to cognitive fitness in aging, independently from age-related brain structural modifications that can ultimately lead to dementia.",

    "abstract": "Cellular lipidome is highly regulated through lipogenesis, rendering diverse double-bond positional isomers (C=C isomer) of a given unsaturated lipid species. In recent years, there are increasing reports indicating the physiological roles of C=C isomer compositions associated with diseases, while the biochemistry has not been fully understood due to the challenge in characterizing lipid isomers inherent to conventional mass spectrometry-based lipidomics. To address this challenge, we reported a universal, user-friendly, derivatization-based strategy, MELDI (mCPBA Epoxidation for Lipid Double-bond Identification), which enables both large-scale identification and spatial mapping of biological C=C isomers using commercial mass spectrometers without any instrument modification. With the developed liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) lipidomics workflow, we elucidated more than 100 isomers among mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acids and glycerophospholipids in both human serum, where novel isomers of low abundance were unambiguously quantified for the first time. The capability of MELDI-LC-MS in lipidome analysis was further demonstrated using the differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, providing an insight into the cellular lipid reprogramming upon stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD1) inhibition. Finally, we highlighted the versatility of MELDI coupled with mass spectrometry imaging to spatially resolve cancer-associated alteration of lipid isomers in a metastatic mouse tissue section. Our results suggested that MELDI will contribute to current lipidomics pipelines with a deeper level of structural information, allowing us to investigate underlying lipid biochemistry.",

In activated NK cells, a metabolic response towards increased glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation is crucial for NK cell effector functions. However, there is accumulating evidence that NK cells become dysfunctional during chronic inflammatory diseases, such as human breast cancer. This dysfunction is apparent in peripheral blood NK cells and can impact on normal NK cell immune responses and their effective targeting during immunotherapy. Herein, we demonstrate that prolonged cytokine stimulation combined with metabolic restriction, through inhibition of mTORC1, is sufficient to induce persistent dysfunction in human NK cells. TGF{beta}, also restricted NK cell metabolism and promoted persistent NK cell dysfunction. NK cells from patients with metastatic breast cancer had profound metabolic defects in glycolysis and mitochondrial function, and clear structural differences in NK cell mitochondrial morphology. Importantly, blocking elevated TGF{beta} improved readouts of metabolism and restored IFN{gamma} production in patient NK cells.",

This is due to STED utilising both a high power depletion laser (increasing risk of photodamage), while the depletion beam is very sensitive to sample-induced aberrations. Here we demonstrate a custom-built 3D STED microscope with automated aberration correction that is capable of 3D super-resolution imaging through thick, highly aberrating, tissue. We introduce and investigate image denoising by block-matching and collaborative filtering (BM3D) to numerically enhance fine object details otherwise mixed with noise. Numerical denoising provides an increase in the final effective resolution of the STED imaging of 31% using the well-established Fourier ring correlation metric. Experimental validation of the proposed method is achieved through super-resolved 3D imaging of axons in differentiated induced pluripotent stem cells growing under a 80{micro}m thick layer of tissue with lateral and axial resolution of 256nm and 300nm, respectively.",

    "abstract": "MotivationAlthough genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have deepened our understanding of the genetic architecture of complex traits, the mechanistic links that underlie how genetic variants cause complex traits remains elusive. To advance our understanding of the underlying mechanistic links, various consortia have collected a vast volume of genomic data that enable us to investigate the role that genetic variants play in gene expression regulation. Recently, a collaborative mixed model (CoMM) [42] was proposed to jointly interrogate genome on complex traits by integrating both the GWAS dataset and the expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) dataset. Although CoMM is a powerful approach that leverages regulatory information while accounting for the uncertainty in using an eQTL dataset, it requires individual-level GWAS data and cannot fully make use of widely available GWAS summary statistics. Therefore, statistically efficient methods that leverages transcriptome information using only summary statistics information from GWAS data are required.\\n\\nResultsIn this study, we propose a novel probabilistic model, CoMM-S2, to examine the mechanistic role that genetic variants play, by using only GWAS summary statistics instead of individual-level GWAS data. Similar to CoMM which uses individual-level GWAS data, CoMM-S2 combines two models: the first model examines the relationship between gene expression and genotype, while the second model examines the relationship between the phenotype and the predicted gene expression from the first model. Distinct from CoMM, CoMM-S2 requires only GWAS summary statistics. Using both simulation studies and real data analysis, we demonstrate that even though CoMM-S2 utilizes GWAS summary statistics, it has comparable performance as CoMM, which uses individual-level GWAS data.\\n\\nContactjin.liu@duke-nus.edu.sg\\n\\nAvailability and implementationThe implement of CoMM-S2 is included in the CoMM package that can be downloaded from https://github.com/gordonliu810822/CoMM.\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "Brain-state fluctuations modulate membrane potential dynamics of neurons, influencing the functional repertoire of the network. Pyramidal cells (PCs) in hippocampal CA3 are necessary for rapid memory encoding, preferentially occurring during exploratory behavior in the high-arousal theta state. However, the relationship between the membrane potential dynamics of CA3 PCs and theta has not been explored. Here, we characterize the changes in the membrane potential of PCs in relation to theta using electrophysiological recordings in awake mice. During theta, most PCs behave in a stereotypical manner, consistently hyperpolarizing time-locked to the duration of theta. Additionally, PCs display lower membrane potential variance and reduced firing rate. In contrast, during large irregular activity, a low-arousal state, PCs show heterogeneous changes in membrane potential. This suggests coordinated hyperpolarization of PCs during theta, possibly caused by increased inhibition. This could lead to higher signal-to-noise ratio in the small population of PCs active during theta as observed in ensemble recordings.",

Positive scores reflect accelerated ageing and are associated with increased mortality risk and poorer physical function. To date, however, the relationship between brain-predicted age difference scores and specific cognitive functions has not been systematically examined using appropriate statistical methods. First, applying machine learning to 1,359 T1-weighted MRI scans, we predicted the relationship between chronological age and voxel-wise grey matter data. This model was then applied to MRI data from three independent datasets, significantly predicting chronological age in each dataset: Dokuz Eylul University (n=175), the Cognitive Reserve/Reference Ability Neural Network study (n=380), and The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (n=487). Each independent dataset had rich neuropsychological data. Brain-predicted age difference scores were significantly negatively correlated with performance on measures of general cognitive status (two datasets); processing speed, visual attention, and cognitive flexibility (three datasets); visual attention and cognitive flexibility (two datasets); and semantic verbal fluency (two datasets). As such, there is firm evidence of correlations between increased brain-predicted age differences and reduced cognitive function in some domains that are implicated in cognitive ageing.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAccurate prediction of exacerbation risk enables personalised chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) care. We developed and validated a generalisable model to predict the individualised rate and severity of COPD exacerbations.\n\nMethodsWe pooled data from three COPD trials on patients with a history of exacerbations. We developed a mixed-effect model to predict exacerbations over one-year. Severe exacerbations were those requiring inpatient care. Predictors were a history of exacerbations, age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, domiciliary oxygen therapy, lung function, symptom burden, and current medication use. ECLIPSE, a multicentre cohort study, was used for external validation.\n\nResultsThe development dataset included 2,380 patients (mean 64{middle dot}7 years, 1373 [57{middle dot}7%] men, mean exacerbation rate 1{middle dot}42/year, 0{middle dot}29/year [20{middle dot}5%] severe).

Predicted rates were 0{middle dot}25/year for severe and 1{middle dot}31/year for all exacerbations, close to the observed rates (0{middle dot}27/year and 1{middle dot}20/year, respectively). In ECLIPSE patients with a prior exacerbation history (n=996, mean 63{middle dot}6 years, 611 (61{middle dot}3%) men, mean exacerbation rate 1{middle dot}82/year, 0{middle dot}40/year [22{middle dot}0%] severe), the area-under-curve was 0{middle dot}73 (95%CI 0{middle dot}70-0{middle dot}76) for [&ge;]2 exacerbations and 0{middle dot}74 (95%CI 0{middle dot}70-0{middle dot}78) for [&ge;]1 severe exacerbation. Calibration was accurate for severe exacerbations (predicted=0{middle dot}37/year, observed=0{middle dot}40/year) and all exacerbations (predicted=1{middle dot}80/year, observed=1{middle dot}82/year). The model is accessible at http://resp.core.ubc.ca/ipress/accept.\n\nInterpretationThis model can be used as a decision tool to personalise COPD treatment and prevent exacerbations.\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSPreventing future exacerbations is a major goal in COPD care. Because of adverse effects, preventative treatments should be reserved for those at a higher risk of future exacerbations. Predicting exacerbation risk in individual patients can guide these clinical decisions. A 2017 systematic review reported that of the 27 identified COPD exacerbation prediction tools, only two had reported external validation and none was ready for clinical implementation. To find the studies that were published afterwards, we searched PubMed for articles on development and validation of COPD exacerbation prediction since 2015, using the search terms \"COPD\", \"exacerbation\", \"model\", and \"validation\". We included studies that reported prediction of either the risk or the rate of exacerbations and excluded studies that did not report external validation. Our literature search revealed two more prediction models neither of which was deemed generalisable due to lack of methodological rigour, or local and limited nature of the data available to investigators.\n\nAdded value of this studyWe used data from three randomised trials to develop ACCEPT, a clinical prediction tool based on routinely available predictors for COPD exacerbations. We externally validated ACCEPT in a large, multinational prospective cohort. To our knowledge, ACCEPT is the first COPD exacerbation prediction tool that jointly estimates the individualised rate and severity of exacerbations. Successful external validation of ACCEPT showed that its generalisability can be expanded across geography and beyond the setting of therapeutic trials. ACCEPT is designed to be easily applicable in clinical practice and is readily accessible as a web application.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceCurrent guidelines rely on a history of exacerbations as the sole predictor of future exacerbations. Simple clinical and demographic variables, in aggregate, can be used to predict COPD exacerbations with improved accuracy. ACCEPT enables a more personalised approach to treatment based on routinely collected clinical data by allowing clinicians to objectively differentiate risk profiles of patients with similar exacerbation history. Care providers and patients can use individualised exacerbation risk estimates to decide on preventive therapies based on objectively-established or patient-specific thresholds for treatment benefit and harm. COPD clinical researchers can use this tool to target enriched populations for enrolment in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "The avocado, Persea americana, is a fruit crop of immense importance to Mexican agriculture with an increasing demand worldwide. Avocado lies in the anciently-diverged magnoliid clade of angiosperms, which has a controversial phylogenetic position relative to eudicots and monocots. We sequenced the nuclear genomes of the Mexican avocado race, P. americana var. drymifolia, and the most commercially popular hybrid cultivar, Hass, and anchored the latter to chromosomes using a genetic map. Resequencing of Guatemalan and West Indian varieties revealed that [~]39% of the Hass genome represents Guatemalan source regions introgressed into a Mexican race background. Some introgressed blocks are extremely large, consistent with the recent origin of the cultivar. The avocado lineage experienced two lineage-specific polyploidy events during its evolutionary history. Although gene-tree/species-tree phylogenomic results are inconclusive, syntenic ortholog distances to other species place avocado as sister to the enormous monocot and eudicot lineages combined. Duplicate genes descending from polyploidy augmented the transcription factor diversity of avocado, while tandem duplicates enhanced the secondary metabolism of the species. Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, known to be elicited by Colletotrichum (anthracnose) pathogen infection in avocado, is one enriched function among tandems. Furthermore, transcriptome data show that tandem duplicates are significantly up- and down-regulated in response to anthracnose infection, whereas polyploid duplicates are not, supporting the general view that collections of tandem duplicates contribute evolutionarily recent \\\"tuning knobs\\\" in the genome adaptive landscapes of given species.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTAvocado is a nutritious, economically important fruit species that occupies an unresolved position near the earliest evolutionary branchings of flowering plants. Our nuclear genome sequences of Mexican and Hass variety avocados inform ancient evolutionary relationships and genome doublings, the admixed nature of Hass, and provide a look at how pathogen interactions have shaped avocados more recent genomic evolutionary history.",

    "abstract": "The avocado, Persea americana, is a fruit crop of immense importance to Mexican agriculture with an increasing demand worldwide. Avocado lies in the anciently-diverged magnoliid clade of angiosperms, which has a controversial phylogenetic position relative to eudicots and monocots. We sequenced the nuclear genomes of the Mexican avocado race, P. americana var. drymifolia, and the most commercially popular hybrid cultivar, Hass, and anchored the latter to chromosomes using a genetic map. Resequencing of Guatemalan and West Indian varieties revealed that [~]39% of the Hass genome represents Guatemalan source regions introgressed into a Mexican race background. Some introgressed blocks are extremely large, consistent with the recent origin of the cultivar. The avocado lineage experienced two lineage-specific polyploidy events during its evolutionary history. Although gene-tree/species-tree phylogenomic results are inconclusive, syntenic ortholog distances to other species place avocado as sister to the enormous monocot and eudicot lineages combined. Duplicate genes descending from polyploidy augmented the transcription factor diversity of avocado, while tandem duplicates enhanced the secondary metabolism of the species. Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, known to be elicited by Colletotrichum (anthracnose) pathogen infection in avocado, is one enriched function among tandems. Furthermore, transcriptome data show that tandem duplicates are significantly up- and down-regulated in response to anthracnose infection, whereas polyploid duplicates are not, supporting the general view that collections of tandem duplicates contribute evolutionarily recent \\\"tuning knobs\\\" in the genome adaptive landscapes of given species.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTAvocado is a nutritious, economically important fruit species that occupies an unresolved position near the earliest evolutionary branchings of flowering plants. Our nuclear genome sequences of Mexican and Hass variety avocados inform ancient evolutionary relationships and genome doublings, the admixed nature of Hass, and provide a look at how pathogen interactions have shaped avocados more recent genomic evolutionary history.",

While low-dose chemotherapy reduces MDSCs in preclinical models, the use of this strategy to reduce MDSCs in GBM patients has yet to be evaluated.\n\nMethodsA phase 0/1 dose-escalation clinical trial was conducted in recurrent glioblastoma patients treated 5-7 days prior to surgery with low-dose chemotherapy via capecitabine followed by concomitant low-dose capecitabine and bevacizumab. Clinical outcomes, including progression-free and overall survival, were measured, along with safety and toxicity profiles. Over the treatment time course, circulating MDSC levels were measured by multi-parameter flow cytometry, and tumor tissue immune profiles were assessed via mass cytometry time-of-flight.\n\nResultsA total of 11 patients were enrolled across escalating dose cohorts of 150, 300, and 450 mg bid, with a progression-free survival of 5.8 months (range of 1.8-27.8 months) and an overall survival of 11.5 months (range of 3->28.0 months) from trial enrollment. No serious adverse events related to the drug combination were observed. Compared to pre-treatment baseline, circulating MDSCs were found to be higher after surgery in the 150 mg treatment arm and lower in the 300 mg and 450 mg treatment arms. Increased cytotoxic immune infiltration was observed after low-dose capecitabine compared to untreated GBM patients in the 300 mg and 450 mg treatment arms.\n\nConclusionsLow-dose, metronomic capecitabine in combination with bevacizumab is well tolerated in GBM patients and was associated with a reduction in circulating MDSC levels and an increase in cytotoxic immune infiltration into the tumor microenvironment.\n\nTrial registrationNCT02669173\n\nFundingThis research was funded by the Cleveland Clinic, Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Musella Foundation, and B*CURED.

    "abstract": "BackgroundPublished genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are mainly European-centric, examine a narrow view of phenotypic variation, and infrequently interrogate genetic effects shared across traits. We therefore examined the extent to which a multi-ethnic, combined trait GWAS of phenotypes that map to well-defined biology can enable detection and characterization of complex trait loci.\\n\\nMethodsWith 1000 Genomes Phase 3 imputed data in 34,668 participants (15% African American; 3% Chinese American; 51% European American; 30% Hispanic/Latino), we performed covariate-adjusted univariate GWAS of six contiguous electrocardiogram (ECG) traits that decomposed an average heartbeat and two commonly reported composite ECG traits that summed contiguous traits. Combined phenotype testing was performed using the adaptive sum of powered scores test (aSPU).\\n\\nResultsWe identified six novel and 87 known ECG trait loci (aSPU p-value < 5E-9). Lead SNP rs3211938 at novel locus CD36 was common in African Americans (minor allele frequency=10%) and near-monomorphic in European Americans, with effect sizes for the composite trait, QT interval, among the largest reported. Only one novel locus was detected for the composite traits, due to opposite directions of effects across contiguous traits that summed to near-zero. Combined phenotype testing did not detect novel loci unapparent by univariate testing. However, this approach aided locus characterization, particularly when loci harbored multiple independent signals that differed by trait.\\n\\nConclusionsDespite including one-third as few participants as the largest published GWAS of ECG traits, our study identifies multiple novel ECG genetic loci, emphasizing the importance of ancestral diversity and phenotype measurement in this era of ever-growing GWAS.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYWe leveraged a multiethnic cohort with precise measures of cardioelectric function to identify novel genetic loci affecting this complex, multifaceted phenotype. The success of our approach stresses the importance of phenotypic precision and participant diversity for future locus discovery and characterization efforts, and cautions against compromises made in genome-wide association studies to pursue ever-growing sample sizes.",

In this study, fungi were cultured from the marine environment in the vicinity of Woods Hole, MA, USA including from plankton, sponge and coral. Our sampling resulted in 36 unique species across 20 genera. We observed many isolates by time-lapse differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy and analyzed modes of growth and division. Several black yeasts displayed highly unconventional cell division cycles compared to those of traditional model yeast systems. Black yeasts have been found in habitats inhospitable to other life and are known for halotolerance, virulence, and stress-resistance. We find that this group of yeasts also shows remarkable plasticity in terms of cell size control, modes of cell division, and cell polarity. Unexpected behaviors include division through a combination of fission and budding, production of multiple simultaneous buds, and cell division by sequential orthogonal septations. These marine-derived yeasts reveal alternative mechanisms for cell division cycles that seem likely to expand the repertoire of rules established from classic model system yeasts.",

Cas12a can bind and cut dsDNA targets with high specificity in vivo, making it an ideal candidate for precise genome editing applications. This specificity is contradictory to the natural role of Cas12a as an immune effector against rapidly evolving phages. However, the native cleavage specificity and activity remains to be fully understood. We employed high-throughput in vitro cleavage assays to determine and compare the native specificities of three Cas12a orthologs. Surprisingly, we observed pervasive nicking of randomized target libraries, with strong nicking activity observed against targets with up to four mismatches. Nicking and cleavage activities are dependent on mismatch type and position, and vary depending on the Cas12a ortholog and crRNA sequence. Our high-throughput and biochemical analysis further reveal that Cas12a has robust activated non-specific nicking and weak non-specific dsDNA degradation activity in trans. Together, our findings reveal Cas12a cleavage activities that could be beneficial in the context of bacterial CRISPR-Cas immunity but may be detrimental for genome editing technology.",

    "abstract": "Measurements of membrane protein structure and function often rely on reconstituting the protein into lipid bilayers through the formation of liposomes. Many measurements conducted in proteoliposomes, e.g. transport rates, single-molecule dynamics, monomer-oligomer equilibrium, require some understanding of the occupancy statistics of the liposome population for correct interpretation of the results. In homogenous liposomes, this is easy to calculate as the act of protein incorporation can be described by the Poisson distribution. However, in reality, liposomes are heterogeneous, which alters the statistics of occupancy in several ways. Here, we determine the liposome occupancy distribution for membrane protein reconstitution while taking into account liposome size heterogeneity. We calculate the protein occupancy for a homogenous population of liposomes with radius r = 200 nm, representing an idealization of vesicles extruded through 400 nm pores and compare it to the right-skewed distribution of 400 nm 2:1 POPE:POPG vesicles. As is the case for E. coli polar lipids, this synthetic composition yields a sub-population of small liposomes, [~]25 nm in radius with a long tail of larger vesicles. Previously published microscopy data of the co-localization of the CLC-ec1 Cl-/H+ transporter with liposomes, and vesicle occupancy measurements using functional transport assays, shows agreement with the heterogeneous 2:1 POPE:POPG population. Next, distributions of 100 nm and 30 nm extruded 2:1 POPE:POPG liposomes are measured by cryo-electron microscopy, demonstrating that extrusion through smaller pores does not shift the peak, but reduces polydispersity arising from large liposomes. Single-molecule photobleaching analysis of CLC-ec1-Cy5 shows the 30 nm extruded population increases the  Poisson-dilution range, reducing the probability of vesicles with more than one protein at higher protein/lipid densities. These results demonstrate that the occupancy distributions of membrane proteins into vesicles can be accurately predicted in heterogeneous populations with experimental knowledge of the liposome size distribution.",

    "abstract": "Drug resistance is a major obstacle for the success of conventional anticancer therapy, and the development of drug resistance is at least partly attributed to tumor propagating cells (TPCs). Up to one-third of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients eventually develop resistance to R-CHOP regimen. We found that the TPC proportion was remarkably increased in resistant germinal center B cell-like (GCB) and activated B cell-like (ABC) DLBCL subtypes. Elevated SOX2 was the determinant for resistance development, and SOX2 was phosphorylated by activated PI3K/AKT1 signaling, thus preventing ubiquitin-mediated SOX2 degradation. Furthermore, multiple factors, including BCR, integrins, chemokines and FGFR1/2 signaling, regulated PI3K/AKT1 activation. CDK6 in the GCB subtype and FGFR1/2 in the ABC subtype were SOX2 targets in the PI3K/AKT1 pathway. Chemical inhibition of PI3K/AKT1 in both subtypes, CDK6 in the GCB subtype, and FGFR1/2 in the ABC subtype significantly enhanced the susceptibility of resistant cells to CHO treatment. More importantly, PI3K and FGFR1/2 inhibitors but not a CDK6 inhibitor effectively suppressed the tumor growth of R-CHO-resistant DLBCL cells, most likely by converting TPCs to chemo-sensitive differentiated cells. Therefore, this pro-differentiation therapy against TPCs warrants further study in clinical trials for the treatment of resistant DLBCL.",

    "abstract": "Substantial advances have been made in the computational design of protein interfaces over the last 20 years. However, the interfaces targeted by design have typically been stable and high affinity. Here, we report the development of a generic computational design method to stabilize the weak interactions at crystallographic interfaces. Initially, we analyzed structures reported in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) to determine whether crystals with more stable interfaces result in higher resolution structures. We found that, for twenty-two variants of a single protein crystallized by a single individual, Rosetta score correlates with resolution. We next developed and tested a computational design protocol, seeking to identify point mutations that would improve resolution on a highly stable variant of staphylococcal nuclease (SNase {Delta}+PHS). Only one of eleven initial designs crystallized, forcing us to re-evaluate our strategy and base our designs on an ensemble of protein backbones. Using this strategy, four of the five designed proteins crystallized. Collecting diffraction data for multiple crystals per design and solving crystal structures, we found that designed crystals improved resolution modestly and in unpredictable ways, including altering crystal space group. Post-hoc, in silico analysis showed that crystal space groups could have been predicted for four of six variants (including WT), but that resolution did not correlate with interface stability, as it did in the preliminary results. Our results show that single point mutations can have significant effects on crystal resolution and space group, and that it is possible to computationally identify such mutations, suggesting a potential design strategy to generate high-resolution protein crystals from poorly diffracting ones.",

Specifically, desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) and nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nanoDESI) mass spectrometry are employed to visualize lipid and protein species on mice tissue sections. The resulting molecular distributions obtained by ambient ionization MSI-microscopy fusion are verified with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MSI and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. Label-free molecular imaging with 5-m spatial resolution can be acquired using DESI and nanoDESI, whereas the typical spatial resolution of ambient ionization MSI is ~100 m. In this regard, sharpened molecular histology of tissue sections is achieved, providing complementary references to the pathology. Such a multimodality integration enables the discovery of potential tumor biomarkers. After image fusion, more than a dozen of potential biomarkers that could be used to determine the tumor margins on a metastatic mouse lung tissue section and Luminal B breast tumor tissue section are identified.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in cryo-EM have made it possible to create protein density maps with a near-atomic resolution. This has contributed to its wide popularity, resulting in a rapidly growing number of available cryo-EM density maps. In order to computationally process them, an electron density threshold level is required which defines a lower bound for density values. In the context of this paper the threshold level is required in a pre-processing step of the backbone structure prediction project which predicts the location of C atoms of the backbone of a protein based on its cryo-EM density map using deep learning techniques. A custom threshold level has to be selected for each prediction in order to reduce noise that could irritate the deep learning model. Automatizing this threshold selection process makes it easier to run predictions as well as it removes the dependency of the prediction accuracy to the ability of someone to choose the right threshold value. This paper presents a method to automatize the threshold selection for the previously mentioned project as well as for other problems which require a density threshold level. The method uses the surface area to volume ratio and the ratio of voxels that lie above the threshold level to non-zero voxels as metrics to derive characteristics about suitable threshold levels based on a training dataset. The threshold level selection was tested by integrating it in the backbone prediction project and evaluating the accuracy of predictions using automatically as well as manually selected thresholds. We found that there was no loss in accuracy using the automatically selected threshold levels indicating that they are equally good as manually selected ones.

    "abstract": "As the life sciences have become more data intensive, the pressure to incorporate the requisite training into life-science education and training programs has increased. To facilitate curriculum development, various sets of (bio)informatics competencies have been articulated; however, these have proved difficult to implement in practice. Addressing this issue, we have created a curriculum-design and -evaluation tool to support the development of specific Knowledge, Skills and Abilities (KSAs) that reflect the scientific method and promote both bioinformatics practice and the achievement of competencies. Twelve KSAs were extracted via formal analysis, and stages along a developmental trajectory, from uninitiated student to independent practitioner, were identified. Demonstration of each KSA by a performer at each stage was initially described (Performance Level Descriptors, PLDs), evaluated, and revised at an international workshop. This work was subsequently extended and further refined to yield the Mastery Rubric for Bioinformatics (MR-Bi). The MR-Bi was validated by demonstrating alignment between the KSAs and competencies, and its consistency with principles of adult learning. The MR-Bi tool provides a formal framework to support curriculum building, training, and self-directed learning. It prioritizes the development of independence and scientific reasoning, and is structured to allow individuals (regardless of career stage, disciplinary background, or skill level) to locate themselves within the framework. The KSAs and their PLDs promote scientific problem formulation and problem solving, lending the MR-Bi durability and flexibility. With its explicit developmental trajectory, the tool can be used by developing or practicing scientists to direct their (and their teams) acquisition of new, or to deepen existing, bioinformatics KSAs. The MR-Bi can thereby contribute to the cultivation of a next generation of bioinformaticians who are able to design reproducible and rigorous research, and to critically analyze results from their own, and others, work.",

    "abstract": "Protrusions are plasma membrane extensions that are found in almost every cell in the human body. Cancer cell filopodial and lamellipodial protrusions play key roles in the integral processes of cell motility and signaling underlying tumor invasion and metastasis. HER2 (ErbB-2) is overexpressed in diverse types of tumors and regulates PI3K-pathway-mediated protrusion growth. It is known that HER2 resides at breast cancer cell protrusions, but how protrusion-based HER2 spatiotemporal dynamics shape cancer signaling is unclear. Here, we study how HER2 location and motion regulate protrusion signaling and growth using quantitative spatio-temporal molecular imaging approaches. Our data highlight morphologically-segregated features of filopodial and lamellipodial protrusions, in in vitro 2D breast cancer cells and in vivo intact breast tumor. Functional-segregation parallels morphological-segregation, as HER2 and its activated downstream pAKT-PI3K signaling remain spatially-localized at protrusions, provoking new protrusion growth proximal to sites of HER2 activation. HER2 in SKBR3 breast cancer cell filopodia exhibits fast, linearly-directed motion that is distinct from lamellipodia and non-protrusion subcellular regions ([~]3-4 times greater diffusion constant, rapid speeds of 2-3 um2/s). Surprisingly, filopodial HER2 motion is passive, requiring no active energy sources. Moreover, while HER2 motion in lamellipodia and non-protrusion regions show hindered diffusion typical of membrane proteins, HER2 diffuses freely within filopodia. We conclude that HER2 activation, propagation, and functional protrusion growth is a local process in which filopodia have evolved to exploit Brownian thermal fluctuations within a barrier-free nanostructure to transduce rapid signaling. These results support the importance of developing filopodia and other protrusion-targeted strategies for cancer.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade there have been impressive advances in determining the 3D structures of protein complexes. However, there are still many complexes with unknown structures, even when the structures of the individual proteins are known. The advent of protein sequence information provides an opportunity to leverage evolutionary information to enhance the accuracy of protein-protein interface prediction. To this end, several statistical and machine learning methods have been proposed. In particular, direct coupling analysis has recently emerged as a promising approach for identification of protein contact maps from sequential information. However, the ability of these methods to detect protein-protein inter-residue contacts remains relatively limited.\\n\\nIn this work, we propose a method to integrate sequential and co-evolution information with structural and functional information to increase the performance of protein-protein interface prediction. Further, we present a post-processing clustering method that improves the average relative F1 score by 70 % and 24 % and the precision by 80 % and 36 % in comparison with two state-of-the-art methods PSICOV and GREMLIN.",

    "abstract": "The problem of RNA design attempts to construct RNA sequences that perform a predefined biological function, identified by several additional constraints. One of the foremost objective of RNA design is that the designed RNA sequence should adopt a predefined target secondary structure preferentially to any alternative structure, according to a given metrics and folding model. It was observed in several works that some secondary structures are undesignable, i.e. no RNA sequence can fold into the target structure while satisfying some criterion measuring how preferential this folding is compared to alternative conformations.\\n\\nIn this paper, we show that the proportion of designable secondary structures decreases exponentially with the size of the target secondary structure, for various popular combinations of energy models and design objectives. This exponential decay is, at least in part, due to the existence of undesignable motifs, which can be generically constructed, and jointly analyzed to yield asymptotic upper-bounds on the number of designable structures.",

    "abstract": "Massively parallel phenotyping assays have provided unprecedented insight into how multiple mutations combine to determine biological function. While these assays can measure phenotypes for thousands to millions of genotypes in a single experiment, in practice these measurements are not exhaustive, so that there is a need for techniques to impute values for genotypes whose phenotypes are not directly assayed. Here we present a method based on the idea of inferring the least epistatic possible sequence-function relationship compatible with the data. In particular, we infer the reconstruction in which mutational effects change as little as possible across adjacent genetic backgrounds. Although this method is highly conservative and has no tunable parameters, it also makes no assumptions about the form that genetic interactions take, resulting in predictions that can behave in a very complicated manner where the data require it but which are nearly additive where data is sparse or absent. We apply this method to analyze a fitness landscape for protein G, showing that our technique can provide a substantially less epistatic fit to the landscape than standard methods with little loss in predictive power. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the complex structure of epistasis observed in this dataset can be well-understood in terms of a simple qualitative model consisting of three fitness peaks where the landscape is locally additive in the vicinity of each peak.",

    "abstract": "We perform logic-based network analysis on a model of the mammalian cell cycle. This model is composed of a Restriction Switch driving cell cycle commitment and a Phase Switch driving mitotic entry and exit. By generalizing the concept of stable motif, i.e., a self-sustaining positive feedback loop that maintains an associated state, we introduce the concept of conditionally stable motif, the stability of which is contingent on external conditions. We show that the stable motifs of the Phase Switch are contingent on the state of three nodes through which it receives input from the rest of the network. Biologically, these conditions correspond to cell cycle checkpoints. Holding these nodes locked (akin to a checkpoint-free cell) transforms the Phase Switch into an autonomous oscillator that robustly toggles through the cell cycle phases G1, G2 and mitosis. The conditionally stable motifs of the Phase Switch Oscillator are organized into an ordered sequence, such that they serially stabilize each other but also cause their own destabilization. Along the way they channel the dynamics of the module onto a narrow path in state space, lending robustness to the oscillation. Self-destabilizing conditionally stable motifs suggest a general negative feedback mechanism leading to sustained oscillations.",

    "abstract": "Microfluidic devices are an empowering technology for many labs, enabling a wide range of applications spanning high-throughput encapsulation, molecular separations, and long-term cell culture. In many cases, however, their utility is limited by a  world-to-chip barrier that makes it difficult to serially interface samples with these devices. As a result, many researchers are forced to rely on low-throughput, manual approaches for managing device input and output (IO) of samples, reagents, and effluent. Here, we present a hardware-software platform for automated microfluidic IO (micrIO). The platform, which is uniquely compatible with positive-pressure microfluidics, comprises an  AutoSipper for input and a Fraction Collector for output. To facilitate wide-spread adoption, both are open-source builds constructed from components that are readily purchased online or fabricated from included design files. The software control library, written in Python, allows the platform to be integrated with existing experimental setups and to coordinate IO with other functions such as valve actuation and assay imaging. We demonstrate these capabilities by coupling both the AutoSipper and Fraction Collector to a microfluidic device that produces beads with distinct spectral codes, and an analysis of the collected bead fractions establishes the ability of the platform to draw from and output to specific wells of multiwell plates with no detectable cross-contamination between samples.",

    "abstract": "Propensity functions of the Hill-type are commonly used to model transcriptional regulation in stochastic models of gene expression. This leads to an effective reduced master equation for the mRNA and protein dynamics only. Based on deterministic considerations, it is often stated or tacitly assumed that such models are valid in the limit of rapid promoter switching. Here, starting from the chemical master equation describing promoter-protein interactions, mRNA transcription, protein translation and decay, we prove that in the limit of fast promoter switching, the distribution of protein numbers is different than that given by standard stochastic models with Hill-type propensities. We show the differences are pronounced whenever the protein-DNA binding rate is much larger than the unbinding rate, a special case of fast promoter switching. Furthermore we show using both theory and simulations that use of the standard stochastic models leads to drastically incorrect predictions for the switching properties of positive feedback loops and that these differences decrease with increasing mean protein burst size. Our results confirm that commonly used stochastic models of gene regulatory networks are only accurate in a subset of the parameter space consistent with rapid promoter switching.\\n\\nStatement of SignificanceA large number of models of gene regulatory networks in the literature assume that since promoter switching is fast then transcriptional regulation can be effectively modeled using Hill functions. While this approach can be rigorously justified for deterministic models, it is presently unclear if it is also the case for stochastic models. In this article we prove that this is not the case, i.e. stochastic models of gene regulatory systems, namely those with feedback loops, describing transcriptional regulation using Hill functions are only valid in a subset of parameter conditions consistent with fast promoter switching. We identify parameter regimes where these models are correct and where their predictions cannot be trusted.",

Yet it has been experimentally unclear whether inhibition-stabilized network (ISN) models describe cortical function well across areas and states. Here we test several ISN predictions, including the counterintuitive (paradoxical) suppression of inhibitory firing in response to optogenetic inhibitory stimulation. We find clear evidence for ISN operation in mouse visual, somatosensory, and motor cortex. Simple two-population ISN models describe the data well and let us quantify coupling strength. Though some models predict a non-ISN to ISN transition with increasingly strong sensory stimuli, we find ISN effects without sensory stimulation and even during light anesthesia. Additionally, average paradoxical effects result only with transgenic, not viral, opsin expression in parvalbumin (PV)-positive neurons; theory and expression data show this is consistent with ISN operation. Taken together, these results show strong coupling and inhibition stabilization are common features of cortex.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria experience drastic changes in their carbon metabolism under daily light-dark cycles. In the light, the Calvin-Benson cycle fixes CO2 and divert excess carbon into glycogen storage. At night, glycogen is degraded to support cellular respiration. Dark-light transition represents a universal environmental stress for cyanobacteria and other photosynthetic lifeforms. Recent studies in the field revealed the essential genetic background necessary for the fitness of cyanobacteria during diurnal growth. However, the metabolic engagement behind the dark-light transition is not well understood. In this study, we discovered that glycogen metabolism can jump-start photosynthesis in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 when photosynthesis reactions start upon light. Compared to the wild type, the glycogen mutant ({Delta}glgC) showed much lower photosystem II efficiency and slower photosystem I-mediated cyclic electron flow rate when photosynthesis starts. Proteomics analyses indicated that glycogen is degraded through the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP) during dark-light transition. We confirmed that the OPPP is essential for the initiation of photosynthesis, and further showed that glycogen degradation through the OPPP is likely to contribute to the activation of key Calvin-Benson cycle enzymes by modulating NADPH levels during the transition period. This ingenious strategy helps jump-start photosynthesis in cyanobacteria following dark respiration, and stabilize the Calvin-Benson cycle under fluctuating environmental conditions. It has evolutionary advantages for the survival of photosynthetic organisms using the Calvin-Benson cycle for carbon fixation.",

To address this, we recently developed a novel model of genetic diversity in Alzheimers disease, the AD-BXD genetic reference panel. In this study, we investigated sensorimotor deficits in the AD-BXDs and their relationship to cognitive decline in these mice. We found that both age- and AD-related declines in coordination, balance, and vestibular function vary significantly across the panel, indicating that genetic background strongly influences the expressivity of the familial AD mutations used in the AD-BXD panel and their impact on motor function. Further, we found that motor decline is not associated withcognitive decline in either AD or aging, suggesting that sensorimotor deficits in AD occur - in part - through distinct mechanisms. Overall, the results presented here suggest that AD-related sensorimotor decline is strongly dependent on background genetics and is independent of dementia and cognitive deficits, suggesting that effective therapeutics for the entire spectrum of AD symptoms will likely require interventions targeting each distinct domain involved in the disease.",

    "abstract": "The human brain has been uniquely equipped with the remarkable ability to acquire more than one language, as in bilingual individuals. Previous neuroimaging studies have indicated that learning a second language (L2) induced neuroplasticity at the macrostructural level. In this study, using the quantitative MRI (qMRI) combined with functional MRI (fMRI) techniques, we quantified the microstructural properties and tested whether second language learning modulates the microstructure in the bilingual brain. We found significant microstructural variations related to age of acquisition of second language in the left inferior frontal region and the left fusiform gyrus that are crucial for resolving lexical competition of bilinguals two languages. Early second language acquisition contributes to enhance cortical development at the microstructural level.\\n\\nSignificant statementThe ability to communicate in two languages is becoming more and more important in the increasingly global community. Does learning a second language (L2) affect the human brain development? At the macrostructural level, there has been neuroimaging evidence revealing neuroplasticity induced by the acquisition of L2. Here, we employed the quantitative MRI technique to investigate the microstructural variations related to L2 learning, and found that age of acquisition of L2, but not its proficiency, is associated with cortical proliferation. Early second language acquisition seems to enhance cortical development at the microstructural level.",

    "abstract": "Despite resting state networks being associated with a variety of cognitive abilities, it remains unclear how these local areas act in concert to express particular cognitive operations. Theoretical and empirical accounts indicate that large-scale resting state networks reconcile dual tendencies toward integration and segregation by operating in a metastable regime of their coordination dynamics. One proposal is that metastability confers important behavioural qualities by dynamically binding distributed local areas into large-scale neurocognitive entities. We tested this hypothesis by analysing fMRI data in a large cohort of healthy individuals (N=566) and comparing the metastability of the brains large-scale resting network architecture at rest and during the performance of several tasks. Task-based reasoning was principally characterised by high metastability in cognitive control networks and low metastability in sensory processing areas. Although metastability between resting state networks increased during task performance, cognitive ability was more closely linked to spontaneous activity. High metastability in the intrinsic connectivity of cognitive control networks was linked to novel problem solving (or fluid intelligence) but was less important in tasks relying on prior experience (or crystallised intelligence). Crucially, subjects with resting architectures similar or  pre-configured to a task-general arrangement demonstrated superior cognitive performance. Taken together, our findings support a critical linkage between the spontaneous metastability of the large-scale networks of the cerebral cortex and cognition.",

    "abstract": "Monitoring and control of our decision process are key ingredients of adept decision-making. Such metacognitive abilities allow us to adjust ongoing behavior and modify future decisions in the absence of external feedback. Although metacognition is critical in many daily life settings, it remains unclear what information is actually being monitored and what kind of information is being used for metacognitive decisions. In the present study, we investigated whether response information connected to perceptual events contribute to metacognitive decision-making. Therefore, we recorded EEG signals during a perceptual color discrimination task while participants were asked to provide an estimate about the quality of their decision on each trial. Critically, the moment participants provided second-order decisions varied across conditions, thereby changing the amount of action information (e.g., response competition or response fluency) available for metacognitive decisions.\\n\\nResults from three experiments demonstrate that metacognitive performance improved when first-order action information was available at the moment metacognitive decisions about the perceptual task had to be provided. This behavioral effect was accompanied by enhanced functional connectivity (beta phase synchrony) between motor areas and prefrontal regions, exclusively observed during metacognitive decision-making. Our findings demonstrate that action information contributes to metacognitive decision-making, thereby painting a picture of metacognition as a second-order process, integrating sensory evidence and the state of the decider during decision-making.\\n\\nSignificanceMonitoring and control of our decision process is a critical part of every day decision-making. When feedback is not available, metacognitive skills enable us to modify current behavior and adapt prospective decision-making. Here, we investigated what kind information is being used to compute an estimate about the quality of our decisions. Results demonstrate that during perceptual decision-making, information about ones actions towards perceptual events is being used to evaluate the quality of ones decisions. EEG results indicate that functional connectivity between motor regions and prefrontal cortex could serve as a mechanism to convey action information during metacognitive decision-making. Considered together, our results demonstrate that post-decisional information contributes to metacognition, thereby evaluating not only what one perceives (e.g., strength of perceptual evidence) but also how one responds towards perceptual events.",

    "abstract": "Global obesity rates continue to rise, presenting a major challenge to human health. Efforts to uncover the drivers of this epidemic have highlighted the contribution of Pavlovian motivational processes to overeating. In humans, brain and behavioral reactivity to food related stimuli positively correlates with subsequent weight gain. In concordance with this, selectively bred obesity-prone rats exhibit stronger cue-triggered food-seeking via single outcome Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (SO PIT) than obesity-resistant rats. These data show that Pavlovian motivation is stronger in selectively bred obesity-prone groups. However, whether obesity susceptibility in outbred populations is associated with enhanced PIT is unknown. Moreover, PIT can arise via two neurobehaviorally dissociable processes, a sensory specific versus a general affective process that cannot be distinguished by SO PIT. Thus, it is unclear which PIT process is enhanced in obesity-prone groups. Therefore, we determined whether obesity susceptibility in outbred populations is associated with enhanced Sensory Specific (SS) PIT or General PIT and whether expression of these forms of PIT differs between selectively bred obesity-prone versus obesity-resistant rats. We find that in outbred rats, the magnitude of General PIT is positively correlated with subsequently determined obesity susceptibility. In selectively bred rats, the magnitude of General PIT was stronger in obesity-prone versus obesity-resistant groups. Jointly, these data show that enhanced affective Pavlovian motivation is tightly linked to obesity vulnerability, supporting a role for phenotypic differences in incentive motivation for the development of obesity. This has important implications for obesity prevention and for understanding the neurocircuitry mediating enhanced food-seeking in vulnerable individuals.",

    "abstract": "Much as humans acquire speech in early childhood, the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) songbird learns to sing from an adult \\\"tutor\\\" during the first three months of life. Within a well-defined critical period (CP), juvenile zebra finches memorize a tutor song that will guide subsequent motor patterning. This sensory learning process is mediated by tutor experience-dependent neuroplasticity within the auditory forebrain. Here, we used longitudinal resting-state fMRI analyses to investigate whether tutor experience also modifies patterns of functional connectivity (FC) within the juvenile zebra finch brain. Eighteen male zebra finches (only males sing) were scanned before, during, and at the end of the CP, as well as at the young adult stage. Prior to the onset of the CP, birds were separated into rearing conditions: Normal (aviary-housed; N=5), Tutored (one adult male tutor and one adult female; N=7), and Isolate (two adult females, isolated from male song; N=6). Brain-wide voxel-wise analyses identified a single cluster overlapping the left caudomedial nidopallium (NCM) of the auditory forebrain that showed developmentally decreasing FC strength in Isolates but stable or increasing FC in Normal and Tutored birds. Additionally, FC between left NCM and left dorsal cerebellum showed a parallel developmental difference. Developmental changes in left NCM FC strength statistically mediated condition-related differences in song stereotypy. These results extend previous reports of tutor experience-dependent plasticity in NCM at epigenetic, genomic, molecular, and cellular levels to the whole-brain functional network level by demonstrating that tutor experience also influences the development of NCM FC. Moreover, these results link NCM FC to the emergence of song stereotypy.",

Gap junctions are key conduits that allow voltage and metabolic signal transmission across cellular networks, yet it has remained unexplored whether they play a role in regulating ageing and longevity. We show that the innexin genes encoding gap junction subunits in Caenorhabditis elegans have extensive and diverse impacts on lifespan. Loss of the neural innexin unc-9 increases longevity by a third and also strongly benefits healthspan. Unc-9 acts specifically in a glutamatergic circuit linked to mechanosensation. Absence of unc-9 depends on a functional touch-sensing machinery to regulate lifespan and alters the age-dependent decline of mechanosensory neurons. The life extension produced by removal of unc-9 requires reactive oxygen species. Our work reveals for the first time that gap junctions are important regulators of ageing and lifespan.",

It is not known whether anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines affect cognitive reappraisal.\n\nAimsWe aimed to investigate the effect of 25 mg oxazepam on cognitive reappraisal.\n\nMethodsIn a preliminary investigation, 33 healthy male volunteers were randomised to oxazepam or placebo, and then underwent an experiment where they were asked to use cognitive reappraisal to upregulate or downregulate their emotional response to images with negative or neutral emotional valence. We recorded unpleasantness ratings, skin conductance, superciliary corrugator muscle activity, and heart rate. Participants completed rating scales measuring empathy (Interpersonal Reactivity Index, IRI), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, STAI), alexithymia (Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20, TAS-20), and psychopathy (Psychopathy Personality Inventory-Revised, PPI-R).\n\nResultsUpregulation to negative-valence images in the cognitive reappraisal task caused increased unpleasantness ratings, corrugator activity, and heart rate compared to downregulation. Upregulation to both negative- and neutral-valence images caused increased skin conductance responses. Oxazepam caused lower unpleasantness ratings to negative-valence stimuli, but did not interact with reappraisal instruction on any outcome. Self-rated trait empathy was associated with stronger responses to negative-valence stimuli, whereas self-rated psychopathic traits were associated with weaker responses to negative-valence stimuli.\n\nConclusionsWhile 25 mg oxazepam caused lower unpleasantness ratings in response to negative-valence images, we did not observe an effect of 25 mg oxazepam on cognitive reappraisal.",
