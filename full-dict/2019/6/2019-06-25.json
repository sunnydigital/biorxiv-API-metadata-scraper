    "abstract": "The proximity risk model offers one possible explanation of honest signalling of aggressive intent in biology. This model assumes that the probability of successful attack is a function of the distance between the contestants and that this distance can be correctly estimated. This later assumption may not hold in nature where contestants have to estimate this distance under noisy conditions. Here I investigate with the help of a game theoretical model whether short-range ranging signals can be evolutionarily stable under such conditions. These signals can help the opponent to estimate the correct distance, thus they can promote honest signalling of intentions. Here I show that ranging signals that help the estimation of distance between opponents can be evolutionarily stable. However, such help only benefits those individuals who are able and willing to attack. As a result, ranging signals in themselves are an honest cue of proximity and in turn they are honest cues of aggressive intent. I give an example: \\\"soft-song\\\" in birds, and I discuss the predictions of the model.",

    "abstract": "Time series data provide a crucial window into infectious disease dynamics, yet their utility is often limited by the spatially aggregated form in which they are presented. When working with time series data, violating the implicit assumption of homogeneous dynamics below the scale of spatial aggregation could bias inferences about underlying processes. We tested this assumption in the context of the 2015-2016 Zika epidemic in Colombia, where time series of weekly case reports were available at national, departmental, and municipal scales. First, we performed a descriptive analysis, which showed that the timing of departmental-level epidemic peaks varied by three months and that departmental-level estimates of the time-varying reproduction number, R(t), showed patterns that were distinct from a national-level estimate. Second, we applied a classification algorithm to six features of proportional cumulative incidence curves, which showed that variability in epidemic duration, the length of the epidemic tail, and consistency with a cumulative normal density curve made the greatest contributions to distinguishing groups. Third, we applied this classification algorithm to data simulated with a stochastic transmission model, which showed that group assignments were consistent with simulated differences in the basic reproduction number, R0. This result, along with associations between spatial drivers of transmission and group assignments based on observed data, suggests that the classification algorithm is capable of detecting differences in temporal patterns that are associated with differences in underlying drivers of incidence patterns. Overall, this diversity of temporal patterns at local scales underscores the value of spatially disaggregated time series data.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation changes in peripheral blood have been identified in relation to lung cancer risk. However, the causal nature of these associations remains to be fully elucidated. Meta-analysis of four epigenome-wide association studies (918 cases, 918 controls) revealed differential methylation at 16 CpG sites (FDR < 0.05) in relation to lung cancer risk. A two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis, using genetic instruments for methylation at 14 of the 16 CpG sites, and 29,863 cases and 55,586 controls from the TRICL-ILCCO lung cancer consortium, was performed to appraise the causal role of methylation at these sites on lung cancer. This approach provided little evidence that DNA methylation in peripheral blood at the 14 CpG sites play a causal role in lung cancer development, including for cg05575921 AHRR, where methylation is strongly associated with lung cancer risk. Further studies are needed to investigate the causal role played by DNA methylation in lung tissue.",

    "abstract": "Ataxin-7 (Atxn7), a subunit of the SAGA chromatin remodeling complex, is subject to polyglutamine expansion at the amino terminus, causing spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7), a progressive retinal and neurodegenerative disease. Within SAGA, the amino terminus of Atxn7 anchors the Non-stop deubiquitinase to the complex. To understand the consequences of Atxn7-dependent regulation of Non-stop, we sought substrates for Non-stop and discovered the deubiquitinase, dissociated from SAGA, interacts with Arp2/3 and WAVE regulatory complexes (WRC). Protein levels of WRC subunit suppressor of extracellular cAMP receptor (cAR) (SCAR) are regulated by a constant ubiquitination/proteasomal degradation mechanism. Loss of Atxn7 frees Non-stop from SAGA, leading to increased Non-stop interaction with SCAR and also increased SCAR protein levels. A Non-stop enzymatic pocket mutation that increases binding to ubiquitin increased interaction with SCAR, while an enzymatic pocket mutation reducing binding to ubiquitin also reduced binding to SCAR. Loss of Non-stop increased polyubiquitination of SCAR and reduced SCAR protein levels although SCAR protein levels were rescued by protease inhibition. Dependent on conserved WRC interacting receptor sequences (WIRS), Non-stop overexpression increased SCAR protein levels and directed subcellular localization of SCAR, leading to decreased cell area and decreased number of protrusions. In vivo, heterozygous mutation of Atxn7 rescued haploinsufficiency of SCAR to produce F actin, but heterozygous mutation of SCAR did not significantly rescue retinal axon mistargeting upon knockdown of Atxn7.\\n\\nSummarySAGA subunits Ataxin-7 and Non-stop regulate stability and subcellular localization of WRC subunit SCAR.

    "abstract": "High-dimensional single cell profiling coupled with computational modeling is emerging as a powerful means to elucidate developmental sequences and define genetic programs directing cell lineages. Here we introduce tSpace, an algorithm based on the concept of \\\"trajectory space\\\", in which cells are defined by their distance along nearest neighbor pathways to every other cell in a population. tSpace outputs a dense matrix of cell-to-cell distances that quantitatively reflect the extent of phenotypic change along developmental paths (developmental distances). Graphical mapping of cells in trajectory space allows unsupervised reconstruction and straightforward exploration of complex developmental sequences. tSpace is robust, scalable, and implements a global approach that attempts to preserve both local and distant relationships in developmental pathways. Applied to high dimensional flow and mass cytometry data, the method faithfully reconstructs known pathways of thymic T cell development and provides novel insights into regulation of tonsillar B cell development and trafficking. Applied to single cell transcriptomic data, the method unfolds complex developmental sequences, recapitulates pathways leading from intestinal stem cells to specialized epithelial phenotypes more faithfully than existing algorithms, and reveals genetic programs that correlate with fate decisions. tSpace profiling of complex populations in high-dimensional trajectory space is well suited for hypothesis generation in developing cell systems.",

    "abstract": "Control of protein expression results from the fine tuning of mRNA synthesis, decay and translation. These processes, which are controlled by a large number of RNA-binding proteins and by localization in RNP granules such as P-bodies, appear often intimately linked although the rules of this interplay are not well understood. In this study, we combined our recent P-body transcriptome with various transcriptomes obtained following silencing of broadly acting mRNA decay and repression factors. This analysis revealed the central role of GC content in mRNA fate, in terms of P-body localization, mRNA translation and mRNA decay. It also rationalized why PBs mRNAs have a strikingly low protein yield. We report too the existence of distinct mRNA decay pathways with preference for AU-rich or GC-rich transcripts. Compared to this impact of the GC content, sequence-specific RBPs and miRNAs appeared to have only modest additional effects on their bulk targets. Altogether, these results lead to an integrated view of post-transcriptional control in human cells where most regulation at the level of translation is dedicated to AU-rich mRNAs, which have a limiting protein yield, whereas regulation at the level of 5 decay applies to GC-rich mRNAs, whose translation is optimal.",

    "abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO)-cyclic GMP (cGMP) signaling is a vasoprotective pathway therapeutically targeted for example in pulmonary hypertension. Its dysregulation in disease is incompletely understood. Here we show in pulmonary artery endothelial cells that feedback inhibition by NO of the NO receptor, the cGMP forming soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), may contribute to this. Both endogenous NO from endothelial NO synthase or exogenous NO from NO donor compounds decreased sGC protein and activity. This was not mediated by cGMP as the NO-independent sGC stimulator or direct activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase did not mimic it. Thiol-sensitive mechanisms were also not involved as the thiol-reducing agent, N-acetyl-L-cysteine did not prevent this feedback. Instead, both in-vitro and in-vivo and in health and acute respiratory lung disease, chronically elevated NO led to the inactivation and degradation of sGC whilst leaving the heme-free isoform, apo-sGC, intact or even increasing its levels. Thus, NO regulates sGC in a bimodal manner, acutely stimulating and chronically inhibiting, as part of self-limiting direct feedback that is cGMP-independent. In high NO disease conditions, this is aggravated but can be functionally recovered in a mechanism-based manner by apo-sGC activators that re-establish cGMP formation.",

    "abstract": "Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) is among the leading causes of blood stream infections in sub-Saharan Africa and other developing regions, especially among pediatric populations. Invasive NTS can be difficult to treat and have high case-fatality rates, in part due to emergence of strains resistant to broad-spectrum antibiotics. Furthermore, improper treatment contributes to increased antibiotic resistance and death. Point of care (POC) diagnostic tests that rapidly identify invasive NTS infection, and differentiate between resistant and non-resistant strains, may greatly improve patient outcomes and decrease resistance at the community level. Here we present for the first time a model for NTS dynamics in high risk populations that can analyze the potential advantages and disadvantages of four strategies involving POC diagnostic deployment, and the resulting impact on antimicrobial treatment for patients. Our analysis strongly supports the use of POC diagnostics coupled with targeted antibiotic use for patients upon arrival in the clinic for optimal patient and public health outcomes. We show that even the use of imperfect POC diagnostics can significantly reduce total costs and number of deaths, provided that the diagnostic gives results quickly enough that patients are likely to return or stay to receive targeted treatment.",

Biochemically, human RAD51 polymerises faster on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) compared to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), raising a key conceptual question: how does it discriminate between them? In this study, we tackled this problem by systematically assessing RAD51 binding kinetics on ssDNA and dsDNA differing in length and flexibility using surface plasmon resonance. By fitting detailed polymerisation models informed by our experimental datasets, we show that RAD51 is a mechano-sensor that exhibits a larger polymerisation rate constant on flexible ssDNA compared to rigid ssDNA or dsDNA. This model presents a new general framework suggesting that the flexibility of DNA, which may increase locally as a result of DNA damage, plays an important role in rapidly recruiting repair factors that multimerise at sites of DNA damage.",

    "abstract": "In this work we analyzed the impact of jumbo phage PA5oct on the planktonic, cell line adhered, and biofilm population of P. aeruginosa. PA5oct has a broad host-range, able to infect up to 40% of our clinical P. aeruginosa Cystic Fibrosis (CF) collection. In the airway surface liquid (ASL) model, the infection of PA5oct effectively reduced the bacterial population both adhered to epithelial cells, mucus entrapped, and dispersed. The explanation for its infectivity can also be linked to the sensitization of infected bacteria to the innate immune mechanisms and pro-inflammatory effect. Interferometry of a 72-hour old biofilm highlighted the contribution of PA5oct in biofilm matrix degradation. Interestingly, two virion-associated proteins, gp162 and gp205, have been found as putative enzymes that can degrade matrix exopolysaccharides. Two third of biofilm clones developed PA5oct phage-resistance and the cross-resistance to both LPS- and pili-dependent phages. Simultaneously, all clones resistant to phage PA5oct maintain the phage DNA within the population, strongly reducing bacterial virulence in vivo. These properties can be considered as key parameters for the application of this bacterial virus in phage therapy settings.\\n\\nOriginality-Significance StatementThe emergence of phage-resistant mutants is a key aspect of lytic phages-bacteria interaction and the main driver for the co-evolution between both organisms. However, this fundamental property also has implications for bacterial eradication in phage therapy settings. Here, we analyze the impact of PA5oct jumbo phage treatment of planktonic/cell line associated and sessile P. aeruginosa population in a preclinical evaluation of this phage for therapeutic applications. Besides its broad-spectrum activity and efficient bacteria reduction in both airway surface liquid (ASL) model, and biofilm matrix degradation, PA5oct appears to persist in most of phage-resistant clones. Indeed, a high percentage of resistance (20/30 clones) to PA5oct is accompanied by the presence of phage DNA within bacterial culture. Moreover, the maintenance of this phage in the bacterial population is correlated to reduced P. aeruginosa virulence, coupled with a sensitization to innate immune mechanisms, and a significantly reduced growth rate. We observed rather unusual consequences of PA5oct infection causing an increased inflammatory response of monocytes to P. aeruginosa. This, phenomenon combined with the loss or modification of the phage receptor makes most of the phage-resistant clones significantly less pathogenic in in vivo model. During phage therapy treatment, phage-resistance is considered as an adverse effect, but our results indicate that it leads to diminished bacterial virulence and increased clearance of the infected host. These findings provide new insights into the general knowledge of giant phages biology and the impact of their application in phage therapy.",

    "abstract": "Gambling disorder is a serious psychiatric condition characterized by decision-making and reward processing impairments that are associated with dysfunctional brain activity in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). However, it remains unclear whether OFC functional abnormalities in gambling disorder are accompanied by structural abnormalities. We addressed this question by examining the organization of sulci and gyri in the OFC. This organization is in place very early and stable across life, such that OFC sulcogyral patterns (classified into Type I, II and III) can be regarded as potential pre-morbid markers of pathological conditions. We gathered structural brain data from nine existing studies, reaching a total of 165 individuals with gambling disorder and 159 healthy controls. Our results, supported by both frequentist and Bayesian statistics, show that the distribution of OFC sulcogyral patterns is skewed in individuals with gambling disorder, with an increased prevalence of Type II pattern compared with healthy controls. Examination of gambling severity did not reveal any significant relationship between OFC sulcogyral patterns and disease severity. Altogether, our results provide evidence for a skewed distribution of OFC sulcogyral patterns in gambling disorder, and suggest that pattern Type II might represent a pre-morbid structural brain marker of the disease. It will be important to investigate more closely the functional implications of these structural abnormalities in future work.",

    "abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks are a feature of many acute and long-term neurological disorders, including neurodegeneration, following neurotrauma and after stroke. Persistent activation of the DNA damage response in response to double strand breaks contributes to neural dysfunction and pathology as it can force post-mitotic neurons to re-enter the cell cycle leading to senescence or apoptosis. Mature, non-dividing neurons may tolerate low levels of DNA damage, in which case muting the DNA damage response might be neuroprotective. Here, we show that attenuating the DNA damage response by targeting the meiotic recombination 11, Rad50, Nijmegen breakage syndrome 1 complex, which is involved in double strand break recognition, is neuroprotective in three neurodegeneration models in Drosophila and prevents A{beta}1-42-induced loss of synapses in embryonic hippocampal neurons. Attenuating the DNA damage response after optic nerve injury is also neuroprotective to retinal ganglion cells and promotes dramatic regeneration of their neurites both in vitro and in vivo. Dorsal root ganglion neurons similarly regenerate when the DNA damage response is targeted in vitro and in vivo and this strategy also induces significant restoration of lost function after spinal cord injury. We conclude that muting the DNA damage response in the nervous system is neuroprotective in multiple neurological disorders. Our results point to new therapies to maintain or repair the nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with Alzheimers disease (AD) dementia exhibit significant heterogeneity across clinical symptoms, atrophy patterns, and spatial distribution of Tau deposition. Most previous studies of AD heterogeneity have focused on atypical clinical subtypes, defined subtypes with a single modality, or restricted their analyses to a priori brain regions and cognitive tests. Here, we considered a data-driven hierarchical Bayesian model to identify latent factors from atrophy patterns and cognitive deficits simultaneously, thus exploiting the rich dimensionality within each modality. Unlike most previous studies, our model allows each factor to be expressed to varying degrees within an individual, in order to reflect potential multiple co-existing pathologies.\\n\\nBy applying our model to ADNI-GO/2 AD dementia participants, we found three atrophy-cognitive factors. The first factor was associated with medial temporal lobe atrophy, episodic memory deficits and disorientation to time/place (\\\"MTL-Memory\\\"). The second factor was associated with lateral temporal atrophy and language deficits (\\\"Lateral Temporal-Language\\\"). The third factor was associated with atrophy in posterior bilateral cortex, and visuospatial executive function deficits (\\\"Posterior Cortical-Executive\\\"). While the MTL-Memory and Posterior Cortical-Executive factors were discussed in previous literature, the Lateral Temporal-Language factor is novel and emerged only by considering atrophy and cognition jointly. Several analyses were performed to ensure generalizability, replicability and stability of the estimated factors. First, the factors generalized to new participants within a 10-fold cross-validation of ADNI-GO/2 AD dementia participants. Second, the factors were replicated in an independent ADNI-1 AD dementia cohort. Third, factor loadings of ADNI-GO/2 AD dementia participants were longitudinally stable, suggesting that these factors capture heterogeneity across patients, rather than longitudinal disease progression. Fourth, the model outperformed canonical correlation analysis at capturing associations between atrophy patterns and cognitive deficits.\\n\\nTo explore the influence of the factors early in the disease process, factor loadings were estimated in ADNI-GO/2 mild cognitively impaired (MCI) participants. Although the associations between the atrophy patterns and cognitive profiles were weak in MCI compared to AD, we found that factor loadings were associated with inter-individual regional variation in Tau uptake. Taken together, these results suggest that distinct atrophy-cognitive patterns exist in typical Alzheimers disease, and are associated with distinct patterns of Tau depositions before clinical dementia emerges.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIBayesian model reveals 3 atrophy-cognitive factors in typical AD from ADNI-GO/2\\nC_LIO_LIReplicated in independent ADNI-1 cohort; longitudinally stable within individuals\\nC_LIO_LITriple cognitive dissociations among atrophy patterns suggest subtypes, not stages\\nC_LIO_LIOutperforms canonical correlation analysis\\nC_LIO_LIFactor loadings associated with spatial patterns of Tau uptake in MCI\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "1.Sleep loss has detrimental effects on cognitive and emotional functioning. These impairments have been associated with alterations in EEG measures of power spectrum and event-related potentials, however the impact of sleep loss on inter trial phase coherence (ITPC), a measure of phase consistency over experimental trials, remains mostly unknown. ITPC is thought to reflect the ability of the neural response to temporally synchronize with relevant events, thus optimizing information processing.\\n\\nIn the current study we investigated the effects of sleep deprivation on information processing by evaluating the phase consistency of steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs) as well as amplitude-based measures of ssVEP, obtained from a group of 18 healthy individuals following 24 hours of total sleep deprivation and after a night of habitual sleep. An ssVEP task was utilized, which included the presentation of dots flickering at 7.5 Hz, along with a cognitive-emotional task. Our results show that ITPC is significantly reduced under sleep deprivation relative to habitual sleep. Interestingly, decreased ITPC under sleep deprivation was associated with decreased behavioral performance in the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT), a validate measure of reduced vigilance following lack of sleep.\\n\\nThe results suggest that the capability of the brain to synchronize with rhythmic stimuli is disrupted without sleep. Thus, decreased ITPC may represent an objective and mechanistic measure of sleep loss, allowing future work to study the relation between brain-world synchrony and the specific functional impairments associated with sleep deprivation.",

Pairwise sample estimates grouped the captive population distinctly from the wild populations, and moderately grouped the southern wild group distinctly from the two northern wild populations. We identified 33 genera modified by captivity, with major differences in key groups associated with cellulose degradation that likely reflect differences in diet.

    "abstract": "The genetic code is necessarily degenerate with 64 possible nucleotide triplets being translated into 20 amino acids. 18 out of the 20 amino acids are encoded by multiple synonymous codons. While synonymous codons are clearly equivalent in terms of the information they carry, it is now well established that they are used in a biased fashion. There is currently no consensus as to the origin of this bias. Drawing on ideas from stochastic thermodynamics we derive from first principles a mathematical model describing the statistics of codon usage bias. We show that the model accurately describes the distribution of codon usage bias of genomes in the fungal and bacterial kingdoms. Based on it, we derive a new computational measure of codon usage bias -- the distance [Formula] capturing two aspects of codon usage bias: (i) Differences in the genome-wide frequency of codons and (ii) apparent non-random distributions of codons across mRNAs. By means of large scale computational analysis of over 900 species across 2 kingdoms of life, we demonstrate that our measure provides novel biological insights. Specifically, we show that while codon usage bias is clearly based on heritable traits and closely related species show similar degrees of bias, there is considerable variation in the magnitude of [Formula] within taxonomic classes suggesting that the contribution of sequence-level selection to codon bias varies substantially within relatively confined taxonomic groups. Interestingly, commonly used model organisms are near the median for values of [Formula] for their taxonomic class, suggesting that they may not be good representative models for species with more extreme [Formula], which comprise organisms of medical an agricultural interest. We also demonstrate that amino acid specific patterns of codon usage are themselves quite variable between branches of the tree of life, and that some of this variability correlates with organismal tRNA content.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects more than 1% of children in the United States. ASD risk is thought to arise from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, with the perinatal period as a critical window. Understanding early transcriptional changes in ASD would assist in clarifying disease pathogenesis and identifying biomarkers and treatments. However, little is known about umbilical cord blood gene expression profiles in babies later diagnosed with ASD compared to non-typically developing (Non-TD) or neurotypical children.\\n\\nMethodsGenome-wide transcript levels were measured by Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 array in RNA from umbilical cord blood samples from both the Markers of Autism Risk in Babies--Learning Early Signs (MARBLES) and the Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) high-risk pregnancy cohorts that enroll younger siblings of a child previously diagnosed with ASD. An algorithm-based diagnosis from 36 month assessments categorized the younger sibling as either ASD, typically developing (TD), or not ASD but non-typically developing (Non-TD). 59 ASD, 92 Non-TD, and 120 TD subjects were included and differences were identified in ASD versus TD subjects, with Non-TD versus TD as a specificity control. Meta-analysis was used to combine the results from both studies. Functional enrichments of differentially-expressed genes were examined across diagnostic groups.\\n\\nResultsWhile cord blood gene expression differences comparing either ASD or Non-TD to TD did not reach genome-wide significance when adjusting for multiple comparisons, 172 genes were nominally differentially-expressed between ASD and TD cord blood (log2(fold change) > 0.1, p < 0.01). These genes were significantly enriched for toxic substance response and xenobiotic metabolism functions, and gene sets involved in chromatin regulation and systemic lupus erythematosus were significantly upregulated (FDR q < 0.05). In contrast, 66 genes were differentially-expressed between Non-TD and TD cord blood, including only 8 genes that were also differentially-expressed in ASD.\\n\\nConclusionsThis is the first study to identify perinatal gene expression differences in umbilical cord blood specific to ASD. The results of this meta-analysis across two prospective ASD cohorts support involvement of environmental, immune, and epigenetic mechanisms in ASD etiology.",

    "abstract": "During healthy brain aging, different brain regions show anatomical or functional declines at different rates, and some regions may show compensatory increases in functional activity. However, few studies have explored interregional influences of brain activity during the aging process. We proposed a causality analysis framework combining high dimensionality independent component analysis (ICA), Granger causality, and LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression on longitudinal brain metabolic activity data measured by Fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). We analyzed FDG-PET images from healthy old subjects, who were scanned for at least five sessions with an averaged intersession interval of about one year. The longitudinal data were concatenated across subjects to form a time series, and the first order autoregressive model was used to measure interregional causality among the independent sources of metabolic activity identified using ICA. Several independent sources with reduced metabolic activity in aging, including the anterior temporal lobe and orbital frontal cortex, demonstrated causal influences over many widespread brain regions. On the other hand, the influenced regions were more distributed, and had smaller age related declines or even relatively increased metabolic activity. The current data demonstrated interregional spreads of aging on metabolic activity at the scale of a year, and have identified key brain regions in the aging process that have strong influences over other regions.",

    "abstract": "At a macroscopic level, part of the ant colony life-cycle is simple: a colony collects resources; these resources are converted into more ants, and these ants in turn collect more resources. Because more ants collect more resources, this is a multiplicative process, and the expected logarithm of the amount of resources determines how successful the colony will be in the long run. Over 60 years ago, Kelly showed, using information theoretic techniques, that the rate of growth of resources for such a situation is optimised by a strategy of betting in proportion to the probability of payoff. Thus, in the case of ants the fraction of the colony foraging at a given location should be proportional to the probability that resources will be found there, a result widely applied in the mathematics of gambling. This theoretical optimum generates predictions for which collective ant movement strategies might have evolved. Here, we show how colony level optimal foraging behaviour can be achieved by mapping movement to Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, specifically Hamiltonian Markov chain Monte Carlo (HMC). This can be done by the ants following a (noisy) local measurement of the (logarithm of) the resource probability gradient (possibly supplemented with momentum, i.e. a propensity to move in the same direction). This maps the problem of foraging (via the information theory of gambling, stochastic dynamics and techniques employed within Bayesian statistics to efficiently sample from probability distributions) to simple models of ant foraging behaviour. This identification has broad applicability, facilitates the application of information theory approaches to understanding movement ecology, and unifies insights from existing biomechanical, cognitive, random and optimality movement paradigms. At the cost of requiring ants to obtain (noisy) resource gradient information, we show that this model is both efficient, and matches a number of characteristics of real ant exploration.",

Selection is assumed to act against gene flow at barrier loci, promoting reproductive isolation and speciation. However, evidence for gene flow and selection is often indirect. Here we utilize haplodiploidy to identify candidate barrier loci in hybrids between two wood ant species and integrate survival analysis to directly measure if natural selection is acting at candidate barrier loci. We find multiple candidate barrier loci but surprisingly, proportion of them show leakage between samples collected ten years apart, natural selection favoring leakage in the latest sample. Barrier leakage and natural selection for introgressed alleles could be due to environment-dependent selection, emphasizing the need to consider temporal variation in natural selection in future speciation work. Integrating data on survival allows us to move beyond genome scans, demonstrating natural selection acting on hybrid genomes in real-time.",

Does this pathogen have quantitative virulence efficiency on all hosts or individual solutions for each host? To address this question, we generated an infectivity matrix of 98 strains of Botrytis cinerea on 90 genotypes representing eight host plants. This experimental infectivity matrix showed that the predominant sources of quantitative variation are between host species and among pathogen strains. Furthermore, the eight eudicot hosts interacted individually with Botrytis cinerea strains independently of the evolutionary relatedness between hosts.

To this end, we present a framework that decomposes the weight matrix of a fitted linear model into three subcomponents: the data covariance, the identified signal of interest, and a normalizer. Inspecting these subcomponents in isolation provides an intuitive way to inspect the inner workings of the model and assess its strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, the three subcomponents may be altered, which provides a straightforward way to inject prior information and impose additional constraints. We refer to this process as \\\"post-hoc modification\\\" of a model and demonstrate how it can be used to achieve precise control over which aspects of the model are fitted to the data through machine learning and which are determined through domain information. As an example use case, we decode the associative strength between words from electroencephalography (EEG) reading data. Our results show how the decoding accuracy of two example linear models (ridge regression and logistic regression) can be boosted by incorporating information about the spatio-temporal nature of the data, domain information about the N400 evoked potential and data from other participants.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIWe present a framework to decompose any linear model into three subcomponents that are straightforward to interpret.\\nC_LIO_LIBy modifying the subcomponents before re-assembling them into a linear model, prior information and further constraints may be injected into the model.\\nC_LIO_LIAs an example, we boost the performance of a linear regressor and classifier by injecting knowledge about the spatio-temporal nature of the data, the N400 evoked potential and data from other participants.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Anxiety is known to dysregulate the salience, default mode, and central executive networks of the human brain, yet this phenomenon has not been fully explored across the STEM learning experience, where anxiety can impact negatively academic performance. Here, we evaluated anxiety and large-scale brain connectivity in 101 undergraduate physics students. We found sex differences in STEM-related but not clinical anxiety, with longitudinal increases in science anxiety observed for both female and male students. Sex-specific impacts of STEM anxiety on brain connectivity emerged, with male students exhibiting distinct inter-network connectivity for STEM and clinical anxiety and female students demonstrating no significant within-sex correlations. Anxiety was negatively correlated with academic performance in sex-specific ways at both pre-and post-instruction. Moreover, math anxiety in male students mediated the relation between default mode-salience connectivity and course grade. Together, these results reveal complex sex differences in the neural mechanisms driving how anxiety impacts STEM learning.",

Here we present the first realistic, cell-genome mechanistic epidermal model that shows homeostasis imposes a characteristic log-linear subclone size distribution for both neutral and oncogenic driver mutations, where the largest skin subclones are the oldest subclones. Because homeostasis inherently limits proliferation and therefore clonal sweeps, selection for driver mutations (NOTCH1 and TP53) in normal epidermis is instead conferred by greater persistence, which leads to larger subclone sizes.

This study aimed to assess the association between total and central adiposity measures and lipid profile in Malawi, exploring differences by sex and area of residence (rural/urban).\n\nMethodsData from 12,847 rural and 12,096 urban Malawian residents were used. The associations of body mass index (BMI) and waist-hip ratio (WHR) with fasting lipids (total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprote in-cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides (TG)) were assessed by area and sex.\n\nResultsA great proportion of adults have high BMI and WHR, and this was associated with adverse lipid profiles; higher BMI and WHR were linearly associated with increased TC, LDL-C and TG and reduced HDL-C. BMI was more strongly related to fasting lipids than was WHR. The associations of adiposity with adverse lipid profile were stronger in urban compared with rural residents.\n\nConclusionsThe consistent associations observed of higher adiposity with adverse lipid profiles in females and males living in rural and urban areas of Malawi highlight the emerging adverse cardio-metabolic epidemic in this poor population.

    "abstract": "The liver contains both NK cells and their less cytotoxic relatives, ILC1. Here, we investigate the role of NK cells and ILC1 in the obesity-associated condition, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In the livers of mice suffering from NAFLD, NK cells are less able to degranulate, express lower levels of perforin and are less able to kill cancerous target cells than those from healthy animals. This is associated with a decreased ability to kill cancer cells in vivo. On the other hand, we find that perforin-deficient mice suffer from less severe NAFLD, suggesting that this reduction in NK cell cytotoxicity may be protective in the obese liver, albeit at the cost of increased susceptibility to cancer. The decrease in cytotoxicity is associated with a shift towards a transcriptional profile characteristic of ILC1, increased expression of the ILC1-associated proteins CD200R1 and CD49a, and an altered metabolic profile mimicking that of ILC1. We show that the conversion of NK cells to this less cytotoxic phenotype is at least partially mediated by TGF{beta}, which is expressed at high levels in the obese liver. Finally, we show that reduced cytotoxicity is also a feature of NK cells in the livers of human NAFLD patients.",

The 916 eye and 1375 GTEx samples were sent into a Snakemake-based reproducible pipeline we wrote to quantify all known transcripts and genes, removes samples with poor sequence quality and mislabels, normalizes expression values across each tissue, performs 882 differential expression tests, calculates GO term enrichment, and outputs all as a single SQLite database file: the Eye in a Disk (EiaD) dataset. Furthermore, we rewrote the web application eyeIntegration (https://eyeIntegration.nei.nih.gov) to display EiaD.\\n\\nRESULTSThe new eyeIntegration portal provides quick visualization of human eye-related transcriptomes published to date by database version, gene/transcript, 19 eye tissues, and 54 body tissues.

    "abstract": "O_LIunimodally to temperature, i.e., be maximized at intermediate temperatures and constrained at extreme low and high temperatures. However, empirical evidence linking hot temperatures to decreased transmission in nature remains limited.\\nC_LIO_LIWe tested the hypothesis that hot temperatures constrain transmission in a zooplankton-fungus (Daphnia dentifera-Metschnikowia bicuspidata) disease system where autumnal epidemics typically start after lakes cool from their peak summer temperatures. This pattern suggested that maximally hot summer temperatures could be inhibiting disease spread.\\nC_LIO_LIUsing a series of lab experiments, we examined the effects of high temperatures on five mechanistic components of transmission. We found that (1) high temperatures increased exposure to parasites by speeding up foraging rate but (2) did not alter infection success post-exposure. (3) High temperatures lowered parasite production (due to faster host death and an inferred delay in parasite growth). (4) Parasites made in hot conditions were less infectious to the next host (instilling a parasite  rearing or  trans-host effect of temperature during the prior infection). (5) High temperatures in the free-living stage also reduce parasite infectivity, either by killing or harming parasites.\\nC_LIO_LIWe then assembled the five mechanisms into an index of disease spread. The resulting unimodal thermal response was most strongly driven by the rearing effect. Transmission peaked at intermediate-hot temperatures (25-26{degrees}C) and then decreased at maximally hot temperatures (30-32{degrees}C). However, transmission at these maximally hot temperatures only trended slightly lower than the baseline control (20{degrees}C), which easily sustains epidemics in laboratory conditions and in nature. Overall, we conclude that while exposure to hot epilimnetic temperatures does somewhat constrain disease, we lack evidence that this effect fully explains the lack of summer epidemics in this natural system. This work demonstrates the importance of experimentally testing hypothesized mechanisms of thermal constraints on disease transmission. Furthermore, it cautions against drawing conclusions based on field patterns and theory alone.\\nC_LI",

While at least one reliable open reading frame (ORF) model has been assigned for every gene, the majority of alternative isoforms remains uncharacterized experimentally. This is primarily due to: i) vast differences of overall levels between different isoforms expressed from common genes, and ii) the difficulty of obtaining contiguous full-length ORF sequences. Here, we present ORF Capture-Seq (OCS), a flexible and cost-effective method that addresses both challenges for targeted full-length isoform sequencing applications using collections of cloned ORFs as probes. As proof-of-concept, we show that an OCS pipeline focused on genes coding for transcription factors increases isoform detection by an order of magnitude, compared to unenriched sample. In short, OCS enables rapid discovery of isoforms from custom-selected genes and will allow mapping of the full set of human isoforms at reasonable cost.",

Diffusion MRI (dMRI) could potentially be sensitive to such changes. There is a growing interest in modeling of human cortical areas using a combination of quantitative MRI and 3D microscopy. The purpose of this study was to quantitatively characterize the cytoarchitecture of human cortical tissue from 3D fluorescence microscopy to simulate diffusion MRI (dMRI) signal in the cortex to better understand its diffusion signal characteristics.\\n\\nMethodsDiffusion of water molecules and dMRI signal were simulated by an indirect geometry based method and a direct voxel based method in microstructural details extracted from microscopy of cortex. Additionally, residence times of diffusing spins inside voxel volumes were considered to set effective resolution limits. Mean diffusivity (MD) and kurtosis (MK) were calculated for variable cell and neurite densities, sizes and diffusion times under realistic values for permeability and free diffusion.\\n\\nResultsBoth simulation methods could efficiently and accurately simulate dMRI signals with fractional anisotropy, diffusion coefficient and kurtosis in agreement with previous reports. Simulated MD and MK showed changes with increasing diffusion times specific to cortical cell density and sizes, with MK showing the highest sensitivity. Intra-voxel residence times with increasing diffusion times showed that the effective dMRI resolution approaches the thickness of cortical layers.\\n\\nConclusionsMonte Carlo simulations based on 3D microscopy data enable estimating changes in MD and MK over diffusion times and are sensitive to cortical cytoarchitecture and its possible changes in neurodegenerative disease.

    "abstract": "Several studies suggest a contribution of reversed, excitatory GABA to epileptogenesis. But GABAergic transmission critically depends on the very dynamic combination of membrane potential, conductance and occurrence of other synaptic inputs. Taking this complexity into account implies measuring the postsynaptic responses to spontaneously occurring GABAergic events, in vivo, without interfering with neuronal [Cl-]i. Because of technical difficulties, this has not been achieved yet. We have overcome this challenge by combining in vivo extracellular detection of both optogenetically-evoked and spontaneously occurring unitary inhibitory postsynaptic field-potentials (fIPSPs), with the silicon probe recording of neuronal firing activity, with single cell resolution. We report that isolated acute seizures induced a global reversal of the polarity of CA3 hippocampal GABAergic transmission, shifting from inhibitory to excitatory for a duration of several tens of seconds before returning to normal polarity. Nevertheless we observed this reversed polarity only in the post-ictal period during which neurons (including GABAergic interneurons) were silent. Perisomatic inhibition was also affected during the course of epileptogenesis in the Kainate model of chronic epilepsy. One week after Kainate injection, the majority of pyramidal cells escaped inhibitory control by perisomatic GABAergic events. Besides, we did not observe a reversed polarity of fIPSPs, but fIPSPs provided time-locked excitation to a minor subset of CA3 pyramidal neurons. Beside methodological interests, our results suggest that subtle alterations in the regulation of [Cl-]i and perisomatic GABAergic transmission already operate in the hippocampal circuit during the latent period that precedes the establishment of chronic epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "Electrophysiological recordings during perceptual decision tasks in monkeys suggest that the degree of confidence in a decision is based on a simple neural signal produced by the neural decision process. Attractor neural networks provide an appropriate biophysical modeling framework, and account for the experimental results very well. However, it remains unclear whether attractor neural networks can account for confidence reports in humans. We present the results from an experiment in which participants are asked to perform an orientation discrimination task, followed by a confidence judgment. Here we show that an attractor neural network model quantitatively reproduces, for each participant, the relations between accuracy, response times and confidence. We show that the attractor neural network also accounts for confidence-specific sequential effects observed in the experiment (participants are faster on trials following high confidence trials). Remarkably, this is obtained as an inevitable outcome of the network dynamics, without any feedback specific to the previous decision (that would result in, e.g., a change in the model parameters before the onset of the next trial). Our results thus suggest that a metacognitive process such as confidence in ones decision is linked to the intrinsically nonlinear dynamics of the decision-making neural network.",

    "abstract": "Single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) is a powerful technique for nanometer-scale studies of single molecules. Solution-based smFRET, in particular, can be used to study equilibrium intra- and intermolecular conformations, binding/unbinding events and conformational changes under biologically relevant conditions without ensemble averaging. However, single-spot smFRET measurements in solution are slow. Here, we detail a high-throughput smFRET approach that extends the traditional single-spot confocal geometry to a multispot one. The excitation spots are optically conjugated to two custom silicon single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) arrays. Two-color excitation is implemented using a periodic acceptor excitation (PAX), allowing distinguishing between singly- and doubly-labeled molecules. We demonstrate the ability of this setup to rapidly and accurately determine FRET efficiencies and population stoichiometries by pooling the data collected independently from the multiple spots. We also show how the high throughput of this approach can be used to increase the temporal resolution of single-molecule FRET population characterization from minutes to seconds. Combined with microfluidics, this high-throughput approach will enable simple real-time kinetic studies as well as powerful molecular screening applications.",

    "abstract": "While Granger Causality (GC) has been often employed in network neuroscience, most GC applications are based on linear multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) models. However, real-life systems like biological networks exhibit notable non-linear behavior, hence undermining the validity of MVAR-based GC (MVAR-GC). Current nonlinear GC estimators only cater for additive nonlinearities or, alternatively, are based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) or Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, which present considerable training difficulties and tailoring needs. We define a novel approach to estimating nonlinear, directed within-network interactions through a RNN class termed echo-state networks (ESN), where training is replaced by random initialization of an internal basis based on orthonormal matrices. We reformulate the GC framework in terms of ESN-based models, our ESN-based Granger Causality (ES-GC) estimator in a network of noisy Duffing oscillators, showing a net advantage of ES-GC in detecting nonlinear, causal links. We then explore the structure of ES-GC networks in the human brain employing functional MRI data from 1003 healthy subjects drawn from the human connectome project, demonstrating the existence of previously unknown directed within-brain interactions. ES-GC performs better than commonly used and recently developed GC approaches, making it a valuable tool for the analysis of e.g. multivariate biological networks.",

    "abstract": "Perfusion-related information is reportedly embedded in the low-frequency component of a blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal. The blood-propagation pattern through the cerebral vascular tree is detected as an interregional lag variation of spontaneous low-frequency oscillations (sLFOs). Mapping of this lag, or phase, has been implicitly treated as a projection of the vascular tree structure onto real space. While accumulating evidence supports the biological significance of this signal component, the physiological basis of the \\\"perfusion lag structure,\\\" a requirement for an integrative resting-state fMRI-signal model, is lacking. In this study, we conducted analyses furthering the hypothesis that the sLFO is not only largely of systemic origin, but also essentially intrinsic to blood, and hence behaves as a virtual tracer. By summing the small fluctuations of instantaneous phase differences between adjacent vascular regions, a velocity response to respiratory challenges was detected. Regarding the relationship to neurovascular coupling, the removal of the whole lag structure, which can be considered as an optimized global-signal regression, resulted in a reduction of inter-individual variance while preserving the fMRI response. Examination of the T2* and S0, or non-BOLD, components of the fMRI signal revealed that the lag structure is deoxyhemoglobin dependent, while paradoxically presenting a signal-magnitude reduction in the venous side of the cerebral vasculature. These findings provide insight into the origin of BOLD sLFOs, suggesting that they are highly intrinsic to the circulating blood.",

    "abstract": "The genome is the blueprint for an organism. Interrogating the genome, especially locating critical cis-regulatory elements, requires deletion analysis. This is conventionally performed using synthetic constructs, making it cumbersome and non-physiological. Thus, we created Cas9-mediated Arrayed Mutagenesis of Individual Offspring (CAMIO) to achieve high-throughput analysis of native DNA. CAMIO utilizes CRISPR that is spatially restricted to generate independent deletions. Controlled by recombination, a single guide RNA is stochastically chosen from a set targeting a specific DNA region. Combining two sets increases variability, leading to either indels at 1-2 target sites or inter-target deletions. Cas9 restriction to male germ cells elicits autonomous double-strand-break repair, consequently creating offspring with diverse mutations. Thus, from a single population cross, we can obtain a deletion matrix covering a large expanse of DNA at both coarse and fine resolution. We demonstrate the ease and power of CAMIO by mapping 5UTR sequences crucial for chinmos post-transcriptional regulation.",

    "abstract": "Tumor growth curves are classically modeled by ordinary differential equations. In analyzing the Gompertz model several studies have reported a striking correlation between the two parameters of the model.\\n\\nWe analyzed tumor growth kinetics within the statistical framework of nonlinear mixed-effects (population approach). This allowed for the simultaneous modeling of tumor dynamics and interanimal variability. Experimental data comprised three animal models of breast and lung cancers, with 843 measurements in 94 animals. Candidate models of tumor growth included the Exponential, Logistic and Gompertz. The Exponential and - more notably - Logistic models failed to describe the experimental data whereas the Gompertz model generated very good fits. The population-level correlation between the Gompertz parameters was further confirmed in our analysis (R2 > 0.96 in all groups). Combining this structural correlation with rigorous population parameter estimation, we propose a novel reduced Gompertz function consisting of a single individual parameter. Leveraging the population approach using bayesian inference, we estimated the time of tumor initiation using three late measurement timepoints. The reduced Gompertz model was found to exhibit the best results, with drastic improvements when using bayesian inference as compared to likelihood maximization alone, for both accuracy and precision. Specifically, mean accuracy was 12.1% versus 74.1% and mean precision was 15.2 days versus 186 days, for the breast cancer cell line.\\n\\nThese results offer promising clinical perspectives for the personalized prediction of tumor age from limited data at diagnosis. In turn, such predictions could be helpful for assessing the extent of invisible metastasis at the time of diagnosis.\\n\\nAuthor summaryMathematical models for tumor growth kinetics have been widely used since several decades but mostly fitted to individual or average growth curves. Here we compared three classical models (Exponential, Logistic and Gompertz) using a population approach, which accounts for inter-animal variability. The Exponential and the Logistic models failed to fit the experimental data while the Gompertz model showed excellent descriptive power. Moreover, the strong correlation between the two parameters of the Gompertz equation motivated a simplification of the model, the reduced Gompertz model, with a single individual parameter and equal descriptive power. Combining the mixed-effects approach with Bayesian inference, we predicted the age of individual tumors with only few late measurements. Thanks to its simplicity, the reduced Gompertz model showed superior predictive power. Although our method remains to be extended to clinical data, these results are promising for the personalized estimation of the age of a tumor from limited measurements at diagnosis. Such predictions could contribute to the development of computational models for metastasis.",

    "abstract": "SMCHD1 (structural maintenance of chromosomes flexible hinge domain containing protein 1) has been implicated in X-chromosome inactivation, imprinting and DNA damage repair. Mutations in SMCHD1 can also cause facioscapulohumoral muscular dystrophy. More recently, SMCHD1 has also been detected as component of telomeric chromatin. Here, we identify requirements of SMCHD1 for DNA damage signaling and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) at unprotected telomeres. Co-depletion of SMCHD1 with TRF2 reduced the rate of 3 overhang removal in time course experiments and the number of telomere end fusions. In SMCHD1 deficient cells, the formation of ATM pS1981, {gamma}H2AX and 53BP1 containing telomere dysfunction induced foci (TIFs) were diminished indicating defects in checkpoint signaling. Strikingly, removal of TPP1 and subsequent activation of ATR signaling rescued telomere fusion events in TRF2-depleted SMCHD1 knockout cells. Together, these data indicate that SMCHD1 depletion reduces telomere fusions in TRF2-depleted cells due to defects in ATM-dependent DNA checkpoint signaling. SMCHD1 mediates DNA damage signaling activation upstream of ATM phosphorylation at uncapped telomeres.",

To understand the mechanism, we used Jurkat cells, human PBMCs, and human CD4+ T cells. Our results showed that the inhibition of HIV-1 infection caused by disrupting CypA-capsid interactions is dependent on human TRIM5 (TRIM5hu), suggesting that TRIM5hu restricts HIV-1. Accordingly, we found that TRIM5hu binds to the HIV-1 core. Disruption of CypA-capsid interactions failed to affect HIV-1-A92E infection, correlating with the loss of TRIM5hu binding to HIV-1-A92E cores. Disruption of CypA-capsid interactions in PBMCs and CD4+ T cells had a greater inhibitory effect on HIV-1 when compared to Jurkat cells. HIV-1-A92E infection of PBMCs and CD4+ T cells was unaffected by disruption of CypA-capsid interactions. Consistent with TRIM5 restriction, disruption of CypA-capsid interactions in CD4+ T cells inhibited reverse transcription. Overall, our results showed that CypA binding to the core protects HIV-1 from TRIM5hu restriction.",

However, it remains unknown whether sex can modify an association of EP substrate with SCD.\\n\\nMethodsParticipants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study with analyzable ECGs (n=14,725; age, 54.2{+/-}5.8 yrs; 55% female, 74% white) were included. EP substrate was characterized by traditional 12-lead ECG (heart rate, QRS, QTc, Cornell voltage), spatial ventricular gradient (SVG) and sum absolute QRST integral (SAI QRST) metrics. Two competing outcomes were adjudicated SCD and nonSCD. Interaction of ECG metrics with sex was studied in Cox proportional hazards and Fine-Gray competing risk models. Relative hazard ratio (RHR) and relative sub-hazard ratio (RSHR) with a 95% confidence interval for SCD and nonSCD risk for women relative to men were calculated. Model 1 was adjusted for prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD) and risk factors. Time-updated model 2 was additionally adjusted for incident non-fatal CVD.\\n\\nResultsOver a median follow-up of 24.4 years, there were 530 SCDs (incidence 1.72 (1.58-1.88)/1000 person-years) and 2,178 nonSCDs (incidence 7.09; (6.80-7.39)/ 1000 person-years). Women experienced a greater than men risk of SCD associated with Cornell voltage (RHR 1.18(1.06-1.32); P=0.003), SAI QRST (RHR 1.16(1.04-1.30); P=0.007), area SVG magnitude (RHR 1.24(1.05-1.45); P=0.009), and peak SVG magnitude (RHR 1.22(1.04-1.44); P=0.018), independently from incident CVD. Greater risk of SCD for women than men associated with QRS duration (RHR 1.24(1.07-1.44); P=0.004) and QTc (RSHR 1.15(1.02-1.30); P=0.025) was explained by incident CVD. Furthermore, women had greater odds of SCD associated with heart rate (RSHR 1.19(1.01-1.40); P=0.036), independently of incident CVD.\\n\\nConclusionsSex modifies an association of EP substrate with SCD. In women, global EP substrate is associated with up to 27% greater risk of SCD than in men. Development of sex-specific risk scores of SCD is necessary.

    "abstract": "It has been an established idea in recent years that protein is a physiochemically connected network. Allostery, understood in this new context, is a manifestation of residue communicating between remote sites in this network, and hence a rising interest to identify functionally relevant communication pathways and the frequent communicators within. However, there have been limited computationally trackable general methods to discover proteins allosteric sites in atomistic resolution with good accuracy. In this study, we devised a time-dependent linear response theory (td-LRT) integrating intrinsic protein dynamics and perturbation forces that excite proteins temporary reconfiguration at the non-equilibrium state, to describe atom-specific time responses as the propagating mechanical signals and discover that the most frequent remote communicators can be important allosteric sites, mutation of which could deteriorate the hydride transfer rate in DHFR by 3 orders. The preferred directionality of the signal propagation can be inferred from the asymmetric connection matrix (CM), where the coupling strength between a pair of residues is suggested by their communication score (CS) in the CM, which is found consistent with experimentally characterized nonadditivity of double mutants. Also, the intramolecular communication centers (ICCs), having high CSs, are found evolutionarily conserved, suggesting their biological importance. We also identify spatially clustered top ICCs as the newly found allosteric site in ATG4B. Among 2016 FDA-approved drugs screened to target the site, two interacting with the site most favorably, confirmed by MD simulations, are found to inhibit ATG4B biochemically and be tumor suppressive in colorectal, pancreatic and breast cancer cell lines with an observed additive therapeutic effect when co-used with an active-site inhibitor.",

    "abstract": "Mechanistic kinetic models of biological pathways are an important tool for understanding biological systems. Constructing kinetic models requires fitting the parameters to experimental data. However, parameter fitting on these models is a non-convex, non-linear optimization problem. Many algorithms have been proposed to addressing optimization for parameter fitting including globally convergent, population-based algorithms. The computational complexity of the this optimization for even modest models means that parallelization is essential. Past approaches to parameter optimization have focused on parallelizing a particular algorithm. However, this requires re-implementing the algorithm usinga distributed computing framework, which requires a significant investment of time and effort. There are two major drawbacks of this approach: First, the choice of best algorithm may depend on the model. Given the large variety of optimization algorithms available, it is difficult to re-implement every potentially useful algorithm. Second, when new advances are made in a given optimization algorithm, the parallel implementation must be updated to take advantage of these advantages. Thus, there is a continual burden placed on the parallel implementation. The drawbacks of re-implementing algorithms lead us to a different approach to parallelizing parameter optimization. Instead of parallelizing the algorithms themselves, we run many instances of the algorithm on single cores. This provides great flexibility as to the choice of algorithms by allowing us to reuse previous implementations. Also, it does not require the creation and maintenance of parallel versions of optimization algorithms. This approach is known as the island method. To our knowledge, the utility of the island method for parameter fitting in systems biology has not been previously demonstrated. For the parameter fitting problem, we allow islands to exchange information about their \\\"best\\\" solutions so that all islands leverage the discoveries of the few. This turns out to be avery effective in practice, leading to super-linear speedups. That is, if a single processor finds the optimal value of parameters in time t, then N processors exchanging information in this way find the optimal value much faster than t/N. We show that the island method is able to consistently provide good speedups for these problems. We also benchmark the island method against a variety of large, challenging kinetic models and show that it is able to consistently improve the quality of fit in less time than a single-threaded implementation.Our software is available at https://github.com/sys-bio/sabaody under a Apache 2.0 license.\\n\\nContactmailto:medjk@comcast.net",

    "abstract": "NMR is a widely employed tool in chemistry, biology, and physics for the study of molecular structure and dynamics. Advances in computation have produced scores of software programs necessary for the processing and analysis of NMR data. However, the production of NMR software has been largely overseen by academic labs, each with their own preferred OS, environment, and dependencies. This lack of broader standardization and the complexity of installing and maintaining NMR-related software creates a barrier of entry into the field. To further complicate matters, as computation evolves, many aging software packages become deprecated. To reduce the barrier for newcomers and to prevent deprecation of aging software, we have created the NMRdock container. NMRdock utilizes containerization to package NMR processing and analysis programs into a single, easy-to-install Docker image that can be run on any modern OS. The current image contains two bedrock NMR data processing programs (NMRPipe and NMRFAM Sparky). However, future development of NMRdock aims to add modules for additional analysis programs to build a library of tools in a standardized and easy-to-implement manner.

    "abstract": "Pathogens infecting plants and animals use a diverse arsenal of effector proteins to suppress the host immune system and promote infection. Identification of effectors in pathogen genomes is foundational to understanding mechanisms of pathogenesis, for monitoring field pathogen populations, and for breeding disease resistance. We identified candidate effectors from the lettuce downy mildew pathogen, Bremia lactucae, using comparative genomics and bioinformatics to search for the WY domain. This conserved structural element is found in Phytophthora effectors and some other oomycete pathogens; it has been implicated in the immune-suppressing function of these effectors as well as their recognition by host resistance proteins. We predicted 54 WY domain containing proteins in isolate SF5 of B. lactucae that have substantial variation in both sequence and domain architecture. These candidate effectors exhibit several characteristics of pathogen effectors, including an N-terminal signal peptide, lineage specificity, and expression during infection. Unexpectedly, only a minority of B. lactucae WY effectors contain the canonical N-terminal RXLR motif, which is a conserved feature in the majority of cytoplasmic effectors reported in Phytophthora spp. Functional analysis effectors containing WY domains revealed eleven out of 21 that triggered necrosis, which is characteristic of the immune response on wild accessions and domesticated lettuce lines containing resistance genes. Only two of the eleven recognized effectors contained a canonical RXLR motif, suggesting that there has been an evolutionary divergence in sequence motifs between genera; this has major consequences for robust effector prediction in oomycete pathogens.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThere is a microscopic battle that takes place at the molecular level during infection of plants and animals by pathogens. Some of the weapons that pathogens battle with are known as \\\"effectors,\\\" which are secreted proteins that enter host cells to alter physiology and suppress the immune system. Effectors can also be a liability for plant pathogens because plants have evolved ways to recognize these effectors, triggering a defense response leading to localized cell death, which prevents the spread of the pathogen. Here we used computer models to predict effectors from the genome of Bremia lactucae, the causal agent of lettuce downy mildew. Three effectors were demonstrated to suppress the basal immune system of lettuce. Eleven effectors were recognized by one or more resistant lines of lettuce. In addition to contributing to our understanding of the mechanisms of pathogenesis, this study of effectors is useful for breeding disease resistant lettuce, decreasing agricultural reliance on fungicides.",

    "abstract": "CD4 memory T cells play an important role in protective immunity and are a key target in vaccine development. Many studies have focused on T central memory (TCM) cells, while the existence and functional significance of T follicular helper (TFH) memory cells is controversial. Here we show that TFH memory cells are highly susceptible to NAD induced cell death (NICD) during isolation from tissues, leading to their under-representation in prior studies. NICD blockade reveals the persistence of abundant TFH memory cells, with high expression of hallmark TFH markers, that persist to at least 400 days after infection, by which time TCM cells are no longer found. Using single cell RNA-seq we demonstrate that TFH memory cells are transcriptionally distinct from TCM cells, maintain stemness and self-renewal gene expression, and, in contrast to TCM cells, are multipotent following recall. Surprisingly, TFH memory cells concurrently express a distinct glycolytic signature similar to trained immune cells, including elevated expression of mTOR, HIF-1 and cAMP regulated genes. Late disruption of glycolysis/ICOS signaling leads to TFH memory cell depletion concomitant with decreased splenic plasma cells and circulating antibody titers, demonstrating both unique homeostatic regulation of memory TFH and their sustained function during the memory phase of the immune response. These results highlight the metabolic heterogeneity underlying distinct memory T cell subsets and establish TFH memory cells as an attractive target for the induction of long-lived adaptive immunity.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LICell death during isolation from the tissue prevents the full recovery of TFH memory cells\\nC_LIO_LITFH memory cells are transcriptionally distinct from TCM cells and maintain a broader recall capacity\\nC_LIO_LITFH memory cells are maintained in the absence of antigen but require ICOS signaling and glycolysis\\nC_LIO_LITFH memory cells support late phase antibody production by splenic plasma cells\\nC_LI",

The transduction and processing of these vibrations mediates the ability to discern fine surface features. In the present study, we seek to characterize the effect of changes in scanning speed on texture-elicited vibrations to better understand how the exploratory strategy shapes the neuronal representation of texture. To this end, we scanned a variety of textures across the fingertip of human participants at a variety of speeds (10 - 160 mm/s) while measuring the resulting vibrations using a laser Doppler vibrometer. We found that increases in speed led to systematic increases in vibratory intensity and to a systematic upward multiplicative shift in the frequency composition of the vibrations. Furthermore, we showed that the upward shift in frequency composition accounts for the increase in intensity. The enhancement of higher frequency components accounts for the observed increase in the firing rates of nerve fibers, particularly Pacinian corpuscle-associated fibers, which are most sensitive at the high frequencies.",

    "abstract": "AbstractEnvironmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is emerging as a biomonitoring tool available to the citizen science community that promises to augment or replace photographic observation. However, eDNA results and photographic observations have rarely been compared to document their individual or combined power. Here, we use eDNA multilocus metabarcoding, a method deployed by the CALeDNA Program, to inventory and evaluate biodiversity variation along the Pillar Point headland near Half Moon Bay, California. We describe variation in presence of 13,000 taxa spanning 82 phyla, analyze spatiotemporal patterns of beta diversity, and identify metacommunities. Inventory and measures of turnover across space and time from eDNA analysis are compared to the same measures from Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) data, which contain information largely contributed by iNaturalist photographic observations. We find eDNA depicts local signals with high seasonal turnover, especially in prokaryotes. We find a diverse community dense with pathogens and parasites in the embayment, and a State Marine Conservation Area (SMCA) with lower species richness than the rest of the beach peninsula, but with beta diversity signals showing resemblance to adjacent unprotected tidepools. The SMCA differs in observation density, with higher density of protozoans, and animals in Ascidiacea, Echinoidea, and Polycladida. Local contributions to beta diversity are elevated in a section of East-facing beach. GBIF observations are mostly from outside the SMCA, limiting some spatial comparisons. However, our findings suggest eDNA samples can link the SMCA sites to sites with better GBIF inventory, which may be useful for imputing species from one site given observations from another. Results additionally support >3800 largely novel biological interactions.

Analysis of tumor whole genome sequencing data confirmed that this signature can also be identified in vivo in colorectal and breast cancer patients that have undergone treatment with 5-FU. We also found that more 5-FU mutations are induced in TP53 null backgrounds which may be of clinical relevance. Taken together, our results demonstrate that 5-FU is mutagenic and may drive tumor evolution and increase the risk of secondary malignancies.

    "abstract": "In mouse visual cortex, right after eye-opening binocular cells have different orientation preferences for input from the two eyes. With normal visual experience during a critical period, these orientation preferences shift and eventually become well matched. To gain insight into the matching process, we developed a computational model of a cortical cell receiving - via plastic synapses - orientation selective inputs that are individually monocular. The model captures the experimentally observed matching of the orientation preferences, the dependence of matching on ocular dominance of the cell, and the relationship between the degree of matching and the resulting monocular orientation selectivity. Moreover, our model puts forward testable predictions: i) the matching speed increases with initial ocular dominance and decreases with initial orientation selectivity; ii) matching proceeds faster than the sharpening of the orientation selectivity, suggesting that orientation selectivity is not a driving force for the matching process; iii) there are two main routes to matching: the preferred orientations either drift towards each other or one of the orientations switches suddenly. The latter occurs for cells with large initial mismatch and can render the cell monocular. We expect that these results provide insight more generally into the development of neuronal systems that integrate inputs from multiple sources, including different sensory modalities.\\n\\nNew & NoteworthyAnimals gather information through multiple modalities (vision, audition, touch, etc). These information streams have to be merged coherently to provide a meaningful representation of the world. Thus, for neurons in visual cortex V1 the orientation selectivities for inputs from the two eyes have to match to enable binocular vision. We analyze the postnatal process underlying this matching using computational modeling. It captures recent experimental results and reveals interdependence between matching, ocular dominance, and orientation selectivity.",

    "abstract": "One of the most fundamental organizational principles of the brain is the separation of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neurons. In addition to their opposing effects on post-synaptic neurons, E and I cells tend to differ in their selectivity and connectivity. Although many such differences have been characterized experimentally, it is not clear why they exist in the first place. We studied this question in an artificial neural network equipped with multiple E and I cell types. We found that a deep convolutional recurrent network trained to perform an object classification task was able to capture salient distinctions between E and I neurons. We explored the necessary conditions for the network to develop distinct selectivity and connectivity across cell types. We found that neurons that project to higher-order areas will have greater stimulus selectivity, regardless of whether they are excitatory or not. Sparser connectivity is required for higher selectivity, but only when the recurrent connections are excitatory. These findings demonstrate that the differences observed across E and I neurons are not independent, and can be explained using a smaller number of factors.",

    "abstract": "Heterotrophic plants - the plants that lost the ability to photosynthesis - are characterized by a number of changes at all levels of organization. Heterotrophic plants divide into two large categories - parasitic and mycoheterotrophic. The question of to what extent these changes are similar in these two categories is still open. Plastid genomes of non-photosynthetic plants are well characterized and they demonstrate similar patterns of reduction in both groups. In contrast, little is known about mitochondrial genomes of mycoheterotrophic plants. We report the structure of the mitochondrial genome of Hypopitys monotropa, a mycoheterotrophic member of Ericaceae, and the expression of mitochondrial genes. In contrast to its highly reduced plastid genome, the mitochondrial genome of H. monotropa is larger than that of its photosynthetic relative Vaccinium macrocarpon, its complete size is ~810 Kbp. We found an unusually long repeat-rich structure of the genome that suggests the existence of linear fragments. Despite this unique feature, the gene content of the H. monotropa mitogenome is typical of flowering plants. No acceleration of substitution rates is observed in mitochondrial genes, in contrast to previous observations on parasitic non-photosynthetic plants. Transcriptome sequencing revealed trans-splicing of several genes and RNA editing in 33 genes of 38. Notably, we did not find any traces of horizontal gene transfer from fungi, in contrast to plant parasites which extensively integrate genetic material from their hosts.",

    "abstract": "Brassica juncea (AABB; genome size [~]920 Mb), commonly referred to as mustard, is a natural allopolyploid of two diploid species - B. rapa (AA) and B. nigra (BB). We report a highly contiguous genome assembly of an oleiferous type of B. juncea variety Varuna, an archetypical Indian gene pool line of mustard, with [~]100x PacBio single-molecule real-time (SMRT) reads providing contigs with an N50 value of >5Mb. Assembled contigs were corrected and scaffolded with BioNano optical mapping. Three different linkage maps containing a large number of GBS markers were developed and used to anchor scaffolds/contigs to the 18 linkage groups of B. juncea. The resulting chromosome-scale assembly is a significant improvement over the previous draft assembly of B. juncea Tumida, a vegetable type of mustard. The assembled genome was characterized for transposons, centromeric repeats, gene content, and gene block associations. Both A and B genomes contain highly fragmented gene block arrangements. In comparison to the A genome, the B genome contains a significantly higher content of LTR/Gypsy retrotransposons, distinct centromeric repeats and a large number of B. nigra specific gene clusters that break the gene collinearity between the A and the B genomes. The genome assembly reported here will provide a fillip to the breeding work on oleiferous types of mustard that are grown extensively in the dry land areas of South Asia and elsewhere.",

    "abstract": "Antigens from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), have been shown to stimulate human B cell responses to unrelated recall antigens in vitro. However, it is not known whether natural M.tb infection or whether vaccination with the related species, Mycobacterium bovis BCG, has a similar effect. This study investigated the effects of M.tb infection and BCG vaccination on B cell responses to heterologous pathogen recall antigens. Antibodies against several bacterial and viral pathogens were quantified by ELISA in 68 uninfected controls, 62 individuals with latent TB infection (LTBI) and 107 active pulmonary TB (APTB) cases, and 24 recently BCG-vaccinated adolescents and naive controls. Antibody avidity was investigated using surface plasmon resonance and B cell ELISPOT assays were used to measure plasmablast and memory B cell responses (MBC) in APTB cases and healthy donor controls. APTB was associated with higher levels of antibodies to tetanus toxoid (TT), diphtheria toxoid, respiratory syncytial virus, measles virus and Kaposis sarcoma herpesvirus, compared to uninfected controls. Vaccination with BCG did not alter levels of antibodies against heterologous pathogens. TT-specific antibody avidity was increased in APTB and the ratio of TT-specific plasmablasts to MBCs in the APTB cases was 7:1. M.tb infection boosts serological memory to heterologous pathogens in human subjects and this process may be driven by polyclonal activation of memory B cells.\\n\\nSignificanceMycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) has potent immunostimulatory properties and has been used in adjuvant preparations to improve vaccine responses in animals. This study shows that natural M.tb infection in humans is associated with increased antibody and B cell recall responses to heterologous pathogens. This data suggests a potential role for M.tb antigens in immunotherapies designed to maintain antibody immunity to diverse infections.",

    "abstract": "The group of negative strand RNA viruses (NSVs) includes not only dangerous pathogens of medical importance but also serious plant pathogens of agronomical importance. Tomato spotted wilt tospovirus (TSWV) is one of those plant NSVs that cause severe diseases on agronomic crops and pose major threats to global food security. Its negative-strand segmented RNA genome has, however, always posed a major obstacle to molecular genetic manipulation. In this study, we report the complete recovery of infectious TSWV entirely from cDNA clones, the first reverse genetics (RG) system for a segmented plant NSV. First, a replication and transcription competent mini-genome replication system was established based on 35S-driven constructs of the S(-)-genomic (g) or S(+)-antigenomic (ag) RNA template, flanked by a 5 Hammerhead and 3 Ribozyme sequence of Hepatitis Delta virus, a nucleocapsid (N) protein gene and codon-optimized viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene. Next, a movement competent mini-genome replication system was developed based on M(-)-gRNA, which was able to complement cell-to-cell and systemic movement of reconstituted ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) of S RNA replicon. After further optimization, infectious TSWV and derivatives carrying eGFP reporters were successfully rescued in planta via simultaneous expression of full-length cDNA constructs coding for S(+)-agRNA, M(-)-gRNA and L(+)-agRNA. Viral rescue occurred in the additional presence of various viral suppressors of RNAi, but TSWV NSs interfered with the rescue of genomic RNA. The establishment of a RG system for TSWV now allows detailed molecular genetic analysis of all aspects of tospovirus life cycle and their pathogenicity.\\n\\nSignificanceFor many different animal-infecting segmented negative-strand viruses (NSVs), a reverse genetics system has been established that allows the generation of mutant viruses to study disease pathology and the role of cis- and trans-acting elements in the virus life cycle. In contrast to the relative ease to establish RG systems for animal-infecting NSVs, establishment of such system for the plant-infecting NSVs with a segmented RNA genome so far has not been successful. Here we report the first reverse genetics system for a segmented plant NSV, the Tomato spotted wilt tospovirus, a virus with a tripartite RNA genome. The establishment of this RG system now provides us with a new and powerful platform to study their disease pathology during a natural infection.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies gallolyticus (Sgg) is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for septicaemia and endocarditis in elderly persons. Sgg is also a commensal of the human gastrointestinal tract. Here we demonstrate that Sgg strain UCN34 translocates across tight intestinal barriers in vitro in a Pil3-dependent manner. Confocal images of UCN34 passage across human colonic cells reveals that Sgg utilizes a paracellular pathway. Pil3 was previously shown to be expressed heterogeneously and WT UCN34 consists of about 90% of Pil3low and 10% of Pil3high cells. We found that both the {Delta}pil3 mutant and the Pil3+ overexpressing variant could not translocate across Caco-2 and T84 barriers. Interestingly, combining live {Delta}pil3 mutant cells with fixed Pil3+ variants in a 10:1 ratio (mimicking UCN34 WT population) allowed efficient translocation of the {Delta}pil3 mutant. These experiments demonstrate that heterogeneous expression of Pil3 plays a key role in optimal translocation of Sgg across the intestinal barrier.\\n\\nABSTRACT IMPORTANCEStreptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (Sgg) is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for septicemia and infective endocarditis in elderly persons. Sgg is a commensal of the rumen of herbivores and transmission to humans most probably occurs through the oral route. In this work, we have studied how this bacterium crosses the intestinal barrier using well-known in vitro models. Confocal microscopy images revealed that Sgg UCN34 can traverse the epithelial monolayer in between adjacent cells. We next showed that passage of Sgg from the apical to the basolateral compartment is dependent on the heterogenous expression of the Pil3 pilus at the bacterial surface. We hypothesize that Pil3high cocci adhere firmly to epithelial cells to activate transient opening of tight junctions thereby allowing the traversal of Pil3low bacteria.",

Here we explore an alternative, assembly-free approach that utilizes ultra-long Oxford Nanopore reads to infer the length distribution of satellite repeat arrays, their association with other repeats and the prevailing sequence periodicities.\\n\\nResultsWe have developed a computational workflow for similarity-based detection and downstream analysis of satellite repeats in individual nanopore reads that led to genome-wide characterization of their properties. Using the satellite DNA-rich legume plant Lathyrus sativus as a model, we demonstrated this approach by analyzing eleven major satellite repeats using a set of nanopore reads ranging from 30 to over 200 kb in length and representing 0.73x genome coverage. We found surprising differences between the analyzed repeats because only two of them were predominantly organized in long arrays typical for satellite DNA. The remaining nine satellites were found to be derived from short tandem arrays located within LTR-retrotransposons that occasionally expanded in length. While the corresponding LTR-retrotransposons were dispersed across the genome, this array expansion occurred mainly in the primary constrictions of the L. sativus chromosomes, which suggests that these genome regions are favorable for satellite DNA accumulation.\\n\\nConclusionsThe presented approach proved to be efficient in revealing differences in long-range organization of satellite repeats that can be used to investigate their origin and evolution in the genome.",

    "abstract": "Next generation sequencing produces large volumes of short sequences with broad applications. The noise due to sequencing errors led to the development of several correction methods. The main correction paradigm expects a high (from 30-40X) uniform coverage to correctly infer a reference set of subsequences from the reads, that are used for correction. In practice, most accurate methods use k-mer spectrum techniques to obtain a set of reference k-mers. However, when correcting NGS datasets that present an uneven coverage, such as RNA-seq data, this paradigm tends to mistake rare variants for errors. It may therefore discard or alter them using highly covered sequences, which leads to an information loss and may introduce bias. In this paper we present two new contributions in order to cope with this situation.\\n\\nFirst, we show that starting from non-uniform sequencing coverages, a De Bruijn graph can be cleaned from most errors while preserving biological variability. Second, we demonstrate that reads can be efficiently corrected via local alignment on the cleaned De Bruijn graph paths. We implemented the described method in a tool dubbed BCT and evaluated its results on RNA-seq and metagenomic data. We show that the graph cleaning strategy combined with the mapping strategy leads to save more rare k-mers, resulting in a more conservative correction than previous methods. BCT is also capable to better take advantage of the signal of high depth datasets. We suggest that BCT, being scalable to large metagenomic datasets as well as correcting shallow single cell RNA-seq data, can be a general corrector for non-uniform data.

    "abstract": "Vascular regenerative therapies with conventional human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) currently remain limited by high interline variability of differentiation and poor efficiency for generating functionally transplantable vascular progenitors (VP). Here, we report the advantage of tankyrase inhibitor-regulated naive hiPSC (N-hiPSC) for significantly improving vascular cell therapies. Conventional hiPSC reprogrammed from type-1 diabetic donor fibroblasts (DhiPSC) were stably reverted to naive epiblast-like state with high functional pluripotency with a cocktail of LIF and three small molecules inhibiting the tankyrase, MEK, and GSK3{beta} signaling pathways (LIF-3i). Naive diabetic VP (N-DVP) differentiated from naive DhiPSC (N-DhiPSC) expanded more efficiently, possessed higher proliferation, possessed more stable genomic integrity and displayed higher in vitro vascular functionality than primed diabetic VP (DVP) generated from isogenic conventional DhiPSC. Moreover, N-DVP survived, migrated, and engrafted in vivo into the deep vasculature of the neural retinal layers with significantly higher efficiencies than isogenic primed DVP in a murine model of ischemic retinopathy. Epigenetic analyses of CpG DNA methylation and histone configurations at developmental promoters of N-hiPSC revealed tight regulation of lineage-specific gene expression and a de-repressed naive epiblast-like epigenetic state that was highly poised for multi-lineage transcriptional activation. We propose that reprogramming of patient donor cells to a tankyrase inhibitor-regulated N-hiPSC may more effectively erase epigenetic aberrations sustained from chronic diseases such as diabetes for subsequent regenerative therapies. More broadly, tankyrase inhibitor-regulated N-hiPSC represent a new class of human stem cells with high epigenetic plasticity, improved multi-lineage functionality, and potentially high impact for regenerative medicine.",

We show that individual firing fields of pure grid cells are tuned to multiple head directions, with the preferred sets of directions differing between fields. This local directionality is not predicted by previous continuous attractor or oscillatory interference models of grid firing but is accounted for by models in which pure grid cells integrate inputs from co-aligned conjunctive cells with firing rates that differ between their fields.

We further demonstrate that upon introduction of the coat-proteins, less-condensed gel-like granules form with the RNA creating an outer shell with the proteins mostly present inside the granule. Moreover, by tracking puncta fluorescence signals over time, we detected addition or shedding events of slncRNA-CP nucleoprotein complexes. Consequently, our granules constitute a genetically encoded storage compartment for protein and RNA with a programmable controlled release profile that is determined by the number of hairpins encoded into the RNA.

    "abstract": "The ryanodine receptors (RyR) are ion channels responsible for the release of Ca2+ from the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum and play a crucial role in the precise control of Ca2+ concentration in the cytosol. The detailed permeation mechanism of Ca2+ through RyR is still elusive. By using molecular dynamics simulations with a specially designed Ca2+ model, here we show that multiple Ca2+ accumulate in the upper selectivity filter of RyR1, but only one Ca2+ can enter and translocate in the narrow pore at a time. The Ca2+ is nearly fully hydrated during the whole permeation process, with the first solvation shell intact even at the narrowest constrict sites of the selectivity filter and gate. These results present a one-at-a-time permeation pattern for the hydrated ions, which is distinct from the fully/partially dehydrated knock-on permeation in K+ and Na+ channels and uncovers the underlying reason for the high permeability and low selectivity of the RyR channels.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we provide a time-dependent (td-) mechanical model, taking advantage of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, quasiharmonic analysis of MD trajectories and td-linear response theories (td-LRT) to describe vibrational energy redistribution within the protein matrix. The theoretical description explains the observed biphasic responses of specific residues in myoglobin to CO-photolysis and photoexcitation on heme. The fast responses are found triggered by impulsive forces and propagated mainly by principal modes <40 cm-1. The predicted fast responses for individual atoms are then used to study signal propagation within protein matrix and signals are found to propagate [~] 8 times faster across helices (4076 m/s) than within the helices, suggesting the importance of tertiary packing in proteins sensitivity to external perturbations. We further develop a method to integrate multiple intramolecular signal pathways and discover frequent \\\"communicators\\\". These communicators are found evolutionarily conserved including those distant from the heme.",

    "abstract": "HER2 plays a critical role in tumorigenesis and is associated with poor prognosis of HER2-positive breast cancers. Although, anti-HER2 drugs show benefits in breast cancer therapy, de novo or acquired resistance often develop. Epigenetic factors have been increasingly targeted for therapeutic purposes, however, such mechanisms interacting with HER2 signaling are poorly understood. This study reports the synergistic interplay between histone demethylase PHF8 and HER2 signaling, i.e. PHF8 is elevated in HER2-positive breast cancers and is upregulated by HER2; PHF8 plays coactivator roles in regulating HER2 expression and HER2-driven epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and cytokines. The HER2-PHF8-IL-6 regulatory axis was proved both in cell lines and in the newly established MMTV-Her2/MMTV-Cre/Phf8flox/flox models, with which the oncogenic function of Phf8 in breast cancer in vivo was revealed for the first time. Furthermore, PHF8-IL-6 axis contributes to the resistance of Trastuzumab in vitro and may play a critical role in the infiltration of T-cells in HER2-driven breast cancers. This study reveals novel epigenetic mechanisms underlying HER2-driven cancer development and anti-HER2 drug resistance.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila Larval hematopoiesis takes place at the lymph gland, where myeloid-like progenitors differentiate into Plasmatocytes and Crystal Cells, under regulation of conserved signaling pathways. It has been established that the Notch pathway plays a specific role in Crystal Cell differentiation and maintenance. In mammalian hematopoiesis, the Notch pathway has been proposed to fulfill broader functions, including Hematopoietic Stem Cell maintenance and cell fate decision in progenitors. In this work we describe different roles that Notch plays in the lymph gland. We show that Notch, activated by its ligand Serrate, expressed at the Posterior Signaling Center, is required to restrain Core Progenitor differentiation. We define a novel population of blood cell progenitors that we name Distal Progenitors, where Notch, activated by Serrate expressed in Lineage Specifying Cells at the Medullary Zone/Cortical Zone boundary, regulates a binary decision between Plasmatocyte and Crystal Cell fates. Thus, Notch plays context-specific functions in different blood cell progenitor populations of the Drosophila lymph gland.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=72 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/682658v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (15K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8f3c25org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b5d8d1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ad99cforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4d0bd9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Idiopathic scoliosis (IS) is the most common type of musculoskeletal defect effecting children and is classified by age of onset, location, and degree of spine curvature. Although rare, the onset of IS during infancy is the more severe and rapidly progressive form of the disease, leading to increased mortality due to significant respiratory compromise. The pathophysiology of IS, in particular for infantile IS, remain elusive. Here, we show that PRMT5 is critical for the regulation of terminal hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation in the spine and models infantile IS in mouse. Conditional ablation of PRMT5 in osteochondral progenitors led to impaired terminal hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation and asymmetric defects of endochondral bone formation in the perinatal spine. Analysis of several markers of endochondral ossification revealed increased COLX and Ihh expression and a dramatic reduction of Mmp13 and RUNX2 expression in the intervertebral disc and vertebral growth plate. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PRMT5 function in committed chondrogenic lineages is required for regulation of COLX expression in the adult spine. Together, our results establish PRMT5 as a critical regulator of hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation and endochondral bone formation in spine development and maintenance.",

    "abstract": "In all metazoan species, sperm is produced from germline stem cells. These self-renew and produce daughter cells that amplify and differentiate dependent on interactions with somatic support cells. In the male gonad of Drosophila melanogaster, the germline and somatic cyst cells co-differentiate as cysts, an arrangement in which the germline is completely enclosed by cytoplasmic extensions from the cyst cells. Notch is a developmentally relevant receptor in a pathway requiring immediate proximity with the signal sending cell. Here, we show that Notch is expressed in the cyst cells of wild-type testes. Notch becomes activated in the transition zone, an apical area of the testes in which the cyst cells express stage-specific transcription factors and the enclosed germline finalizes transit-amplifying divisions. Reducing the ligand Delta from the germline cells via RNA-Interference or reducing the receptor Notch from the cyst cells via CRISPR resulted in cell death concomitant with loss of germline cells from the transition zone. This shows that Notch signaling is essential for the survival of the germline stem cell lineage.",

    "abstract": "Mucociliary epithelia provide a first line of defense against pathogens in the airways and the epidermis of vertebrate larvae. Impaired regeneration and remodeling of mucociliary epithelia are associated with dysregulated Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling in chronic airway diseases, but underlying mechanisms remain elusive and studies of Wnt signaling in mucociliary cells yield seemingly contradicting results. Employing the Xenopus mucociliary epidermis, the mouse airway, and human airway basal stem cell cultures, we characterize the evolutionarily conserved roles of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling in mucociliary cells in vertebrates. Wnt signaling is required in multiciliated cells for cilia formation during differentiation stages, but in Basal cells, Wnt signaling prevents specification and differentiation of epithelial cell types by activating{Delta} N-TP63 expression. We demonstrate that {Delta}N-TP63 is a master transcription factor in Basal cells, which is necessary and sufficient to mediate the Wnt-induced inhibition of differentiation and is required to retain basal stem cells during development. Chronic stimulation of Wnt signaling leads to mucociliary remodeling and Basal cell hyperplasia, but this is reversible in vivo and in vitro, suggesting Wnt inhibition as an option in the treatment of chronic lung diseases. Our work sheds light into the evolutionarily conserved regulation of stem cells and differentiation, resolves Wnt functions in mucociliary epithelia, and provides crucial insights into mucociliary development, regeneration and disease mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "In certain plant hybrids, autoimmunity is triggered by immune components that interact in the absence of a pathogen trigger. Often, NLR immune receptors are involved, with a particularly interesting case in Arabidopsis thaliana involving variants of the NLR RPP7 as well as variants of RPW8/HR proteins, which are homologs of animal MLKL and fungal HELL domain proteins. We demonstrate that HR4Fei-0 but not the closely related HR4Col-0 protein directly disrupts intramolecular association of RPP7bLerik1-3, which in turn initiates P-loop dependent NLR signaling. In agreement, RPP7bLerik1-3 forms a higher-order complex only in the presence of HR4Fei-0 but not HR4Col-0. In addition, we find that HR4Fei-0 on its own can form detergent-resistant oligomers suggestive of amyloid-like aggregates, which in turn can directly kill cells in an RPP7bLerik1-3-independent manner. Our work provides in vivo biochemical evidence for a plant resistosome complex and the mechanisms by which RPW8/HR proteins trigger cell death.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic heterogeneity between individual cells of a population harbors offers significant challenges for fundamental and applied research. Identifying metabolic heterogeneity and investigating its emergence requires tools to zoom into metabolism of individual cells. While methods exist to measure metabolite levels in single cells, we lack capability to measure metabolic flux, i.e. the ultimate functional output of metabolic activity, on the single-cell level. Here, combining promoter engineering, computational protein design, biochemical methods, proteomics and metabolomics, we developed a biosensor to measure glycolytic flux in single yeast cells, by drawing on the robust cell-intrinsic correlation between glycolytic flux and levels of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), and by transplanting the B. subtilis FBP-binding transcription factor CggR into yeast. As proof of principle, using fluorescence microscopy, we applied the sensor to identify metabolic subpopulations in yeast cultures. We anticipate that our biosensor will become a valuable tool to identify and study metabolic heterogeneity in cell populations.",

T-helper (TH17) cells, defined by ROR{gamma}t-dependent production of IL-17A and IL-17F, exert homeostatic functions in the gut upon microbiota-directed differentiation from naive CD4+ T cells. In the non-pathogenic setting, their cytokine production is regulated by serum amyloid A proteins (SAA1 and SAA2) secreted by adjacent intestinal epithelial cells. However, TH17 cell behaviors vary markedly according to their environment. Here we show that SAAs additionally direct a pathogenic pro-inflammatory TH17 cell differentiation program, acting directly on T cells in collaboration with STAT3-activating cytokines. Using loss- and gain-of-function mouse models, we show that SAA1, SAA2, and SAA3 have distinct systemic and local functions in promoting TH17-mediated inflammatory diseases. These studies suggest that T cell signaling pathways modulated by the SAAs may be attractive targets for anti-inflammatory therapies.",
