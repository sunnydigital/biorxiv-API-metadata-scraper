    "abstract": "BackgroundIncrease in mortality involving poisoning, particularly by narcotics, is known to have been one of the factors that affected life expectancy in the US during the last two decades, especially for white Americans and Native Americans. However, the contribution of medicaments other than narcotics to mortality in different racial/age groups is less studied.\\n\\nMethodsWe regressed annual rates of mortality involving poisoning by medicaments but not narcotics/psychodysleptics (ICD-10 codes T36-39.xx or T41-50.8 but not T40.xx present as either underlying or contributing causes of death), as well as annual rates of mortality for certain subcategories of the above, including mortality involving poisoning by psychotropic drugs but not narcotics/psychodysleptics (ICD-10 codes T43.xx but not T40.xx present as either underlying or contributing causes of death) in different age/racial groups for both the 2000-2011 period and the 2011-2017 period against calendar year.\\n\\nResultsAnnual numbers of deaths involving poisoning by medicaments but not narcotics/psychodysleptics grew from 4,332 between 2000-2001 to 11,401 between 2016-2017, with the growth in the rates of those deaths being higher for the 2011-2017 period compared to the 2000-2011 period. The largest increases in the rates of mortality involving poisoning by medicaments but not narcotics/psychodysleptics were in non-elderly Non-Hispanic Native Americans, followed by Non-Hispanic whites. Most of those increases came from increases in the rates of mortality involving poisoning by psychotropic medications; the latter rates grew for the period of 2015-2017 vs. 2000-2002 by factors ranging from 2.75 for ages 35-44y to 5.37 for ages 55-64y.\\n\\nConclusionsThere were major increases in mortality involving poisoning by non-narcotic, particularly psychotropic medicaments, especially in non-elderly non-Hispanic whites and Native Americans. Our results, and the epidemiological data on mortality involving poisoning by different drugs and medications in the US, which are quite different from the ones in many other countries support the need for a comprehensive evaluation of the effect of various drugs, including psychotropic medications on health-related outcomes, the associated mortality the does not involve poisoning being listed on a death certificate, and the impact of medication misuse.",

    "abstract": "The accurate quantification of eukaryotic species abundances from bulk samples remains a key challenge for community description and environmental biomonitoring. We resolve this challenge by combining shotgun sequencing, mapping to reference DNA barcodes or to mitogenomes, and three correction factors: (1) a percent-coverage threshold to filter out false positives, (2) an internal-standard DNA spike-in to correct for stochasticity during sequencing, and (3) technical replicates to correct for stochasticity across sequencing runs. This pipeline achieves a strikingly high accuracy of intraspecific abundance estimates from samples of known composition (mapping to barcodes R2=0.93, mitogenomes R2=0.95) and a high repeatability across environmental-sample replicates (barcodes R2=0.94, mitogenomes R2=0.93). As proof of concept, we sequence arthropod samples from the High Arctic systematically collected over 17 years, detecting changes in species richness, abundance, and phenology using either barcodes or mitogenomes. SPIKEPIPE provides cost-efficient and reliable quantification of eukaryotic communities, with direct application to environmental biomonitoring.\n\nStatement of authorshipNMS has been involved in running the BioBasis sampling program for more than twenty years.

    "abstract": "Metastasis is a major cause of cancer-related mortality, and it is essential to understand how metastasis occurs in order to overcome it. One relevant question is the origin of a metastatic tumor cell population. Although the hypothesis of a single-cell origin for metastasis from a primary tumor has long been prevalent, several recent studies using mouse models have supported a multi-cellular origin of metastasis. Human bulk whole-exome sequencing (WES) studies also have demonstrated a multiple  clonal origin of metastasis, with different mutational compositions. Specifically, there has not yet been strong research to determine how many founder cells colonize a metastatic tumor. To address this question, we developed a method to quantify the  founder cell population size in a metastasis using paired WES data from primary and metachronous metastatic tumors. Simulation studies demonstrated the proposed method gives unbiased results with sufficient accuracy in the range of realistic settings. Applying the proposed method to real WES data from four colorectal cancer patients, all samples supported a multi-cellular origin of metastasis and the founder size was quantified, ranging from 3 to 15 cells. Such a wide-ranging founder sizes estimated by the proposed method suggests that there are large variations in genetic similarity between primary and metastatic tumors in the same subjects, which might be involved in (dis)similarity of drug responses between tumors.",

    "abstract": "Determining nanoscale protein distribution via Photoactivated Localization Microscopy (PALM) mandates precise knowledge of the applied fluorophores blinking properties to counteract overcounting artifacts that distort the resulting biomolecular distributions. Here, we present a readily applicable methodology to determine, optimize and quantitatively account for the blinking behavior of any PALM-compatible fluorophore. Using a custom-designed platform we revealed complex blinking of two photoswitchable fluorescence proteins (PS-CFP2 and mEOS3.2) and two photoactivatable organic fluorophores (PA Janelia Fluor 549 and Abberior CAGE 635) with blinking cycles on time scales of several seconds. Incorporating such detailed information in our simulation-based analysis package allowed for robust evaluation of molecular clustering based on individually recorded single molecule localization maps.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=45 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/545152v5_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (16K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b0930org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@883897org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13b7304org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fc136c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "In the nuclear pore complex (NPC), intrinsically disordered nuclear pore proteins (FG nups) form a selective barrier for transport into and out of the cell nucleus, in a way that remains poorly understood. The collective FG nup behaviour has long been conceptualized either as a polymer brush, dominated by entropic and excluded-volume (repulsive) interactions, or as a hydrogel, dominated by cohesive (attractive) interactions between FG nups. Here we compare mesoscale computational simulations with a wide range of experimental data to demonstrate that FG nups are at the crossover point between these two regimes. Specifically, we find that repulsive and attractive interactions are balanced, resulting in morphologies and dynamics that are close to those of ideal polymer chains. We demonstrate that this property of FG nups yields sufficient cohesion to seal the transport barrier, and yet maintains fast dynamics at the molecular scale, permitting the rapid polymer rearrangements needed for transport events.",

SPARKL integrates high-content live-cell imaging with automated detection and analysis of fluorescent reporters of cell death. We outline several examples of zero-handling, non-disruptive protocols for detailing cell death mechanisms and proliferation profiles. Additionally, we suggest several methods for mathematically analyzing these data to best utilize the collected kinetic data. Compared to traditional methods of detection and analysis, SPARKL is more sensitive, accurate, and high-throughput while substantially eliminating sample processing and providing richer data.",

    "abstract": "Our current model of drug discovery is challenged by the relative ineffectiveness of drugs against highly variable and rapidly evolving diseases and their relatively high incidence of adverse effects due to poor selectivity. Here we describe a robust and reproducible platform which could potentially address these limitations. The platform enables rapid, de-novo discovery of DNA oligonucleotides evolved in-vitro to exert specific biological effects on target cells. Unlike aptamers, which are selected by their ligand binding capacity, this platform is driven directly by therapeutic effect and selectivity towards target vs negative target cells. The process could, therefore, operate without any a-priori knowledge (e.g. mutations, biomarker expression, or known drug resistance) of the target. We report the discovery of DNA oligonucleotides with direct and selective cytotoxicity towards several tumor cell lines as well as primary, patient-derived solid and hematological tumors, some with chemotherapy resistance. Oligonucleotides discovered by this platform exhibited favorable biodistribution in animals, persistence in target tumors up to 48 hours after injection, and safety in human blood. These oligonucleotides showed remarkable efficacy in-vivo as well as ex-vivo in freshly obtained, 3D cultured human tumors resistant to multiple chemotherapies. With further improvement, these findings could lead to a drug discovery model which is target-tailored, mechanism-flexible, and nearly on-demand.",

By sequencing oligonucleotide pools we generate a physical microfluidic map of hundreds of millions of potential oligo clusters, in which every cluster is mapped to a specific set of spatial coordinates. Tumor cells, pre-loaded with a fluorogenic reporter of apoptosis, are then injected into the chip and monitored over time. Apoptotic tumor cells are identified and analyzed across the entire map, automatically revealing the coordinates of oligos that induced this effect. We demonstrate this method by identifying, within just a few hours, new oligos capable of directly and selectively inducing apoptosis in primary human tumor cells. Such a major capability could lead to a new paradigm of personalized cancer therapy.",

In this study, we generated a novel {beta}-catenin knock-out model in mESCs by using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to delete putatively functional N-terminally truncated isoforms observed in previous knock-out models. While we showed that aberrant N-terminally truncated isoforms are not functional in mESCS, we observed that canonical Wnt signalling is not active in mESCs, as {beta}-catenin ablation does not alter mESC transcriptional profile in LIF-enriched culture conditions; on the other hand, Wnt signalling activation represses mESC spontaneous differentiation. We also showed that transcriptionally silent {beta}-catenin ({Delta}C) isoforms can rescue {beta}-catenin knock-out self-renewal defects in mESCs, cooperating with TCF1 and LEF1 in the inhibition of mESC spontaneous differentiation in a Gsk3 dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "Arabidopsis is an important model organism and the first plant with its genome sequenced. Knowledge from studying this species has either direct or indirect applications to agriculture and human health. Quantitative proteomics by data-independent acquisition (SWATH/DIA-MS) was recently developed and considered as a high-throughput targetedlike approach for accurate proteome quantitation. In this approach, a high-quality and comprehensive library is a prerequisite. Here, we generated a protein expression atlas of 10 organs of Arabidopsis and created a library consisting of 15,514 protein groups, 187,265 unique peptide sequences, and 278,278 precursors. The identified protein groups correspond to ~56.5% of the predicted proteome. Further proteogenomics analysis identified 28 novel proteins. We subsequently applied DIA-mass spectrometry using this library to quantify the effect of abscisic acid on Arabidopsis. We were able to recover 8,793 protein groups with 1,787 of them being differentially expressed which includes 65 proteins known to respond to abscisic acid stress. Mass spectrometry data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD012710 for data-dependent acquisition and PXD014032 for DIA analyses.\\n\\nO_TBL View this table:\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a3f799org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d4711dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4e3f73org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@127a9a4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f254bb_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_TBL C_TBL",

    "abstract": "Protein phosphorylation is a key regulator of protein function in signal transduction pathways. Kinases are the enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of other proteins in a target specific manner. The dysregulation of phosphorylation is associated with many diseases including cancer. Although the advances in phosphoproteomics enable the identification of phosphosites at the proteome level, most of the phosphoproteome is still in the dark: more than 95% of the reported human phosphosites have no known kinases. Determining which kinase is responsible for phosphorylating a site remains an experimental challenge. Existing computational methods require several examples of known targets of a kinase to make accurate kinase specific predictions, yet for a large body of kinases, only a few or no target sites are reported. We present DeepKinZero, the first zero-shot learning approach to predict the kinase acting on a phosphosite for kinases with no known phosphosite information. DeepKinZero transfers knowledge from kinases with many known target phosphosites to those kinases with no known sites through a zero-shot learning model. The kinase specific positional amino acid preferences are learned using a bidirectional recurrent neural network. We show that DeepKinZero achieves significant improvement in accuracy for kinases with no known phosphosites in comparison to the baseline model and other methods available. By expanding our knowledge on understudied kinases, DeepKinZero can help to chart the phosphoproteome atlas.",

A recent genetic data release by UK Biobank has allowed many researchers worldwide to have comprehensive look into the genetic architecture of thousands of human phenotypes. In this study, we developed a novel statistical framework to assess phenome-wide significance and genetic pleiotropy across the human phenome based on GWAS summary statistics. We demonstrate widespread sharing of genetic architecture components between distinct groups of traits. Apart from known multiple associations inside the MHC locus, we discover high degree of pleiotropy for genes involved in immune system function, apoptosis, hemostasis cascades, as well as lipid and xenobiotic metabolism. We find several notable examples of novel pleiotropic loci (e.g., the MIR2113 microRNA broadly associated with cognition), and provide several possible mechanisms for these association signals.

    "abstract": "Optogenetic tools for controlling gene expression are ideal for tuning synthetic biological networks due to the exquisite spatiotemporal control available with light. Here we develop an optogenetic system for gene expression control and integrate it with an existing yeast toolkit allowing for rapid, modular assembly of light-controlled circuits in the important chassis organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We reconstitute activity of a split synthetic zinc-finger transcription factor (TF) using light-induced dimerization. We optimize function of this split TF and demonstrate the utility of the toolkit workflow by assembling cassettes expressing the TF activation domain and DNA-binding domain at different levels. Utilizing this TF and a synthetic promoter we demonstrate that light-intensity and duty-cycle can be used to modulate gene expression over the range currently available from natural yeast promoters. This work allows for rapid generation and prototyping of optogenetic circuits to control gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.",

    "abstract": "Kaufman oculocerebrofacial syndrome (KOS) is a severe autosomal recessive disorder characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delays, microcephaly and characteristic dysmorphisms. Biallelic mutations of UBE3B, encoding for a ubiquitin ligase E3B are causative for KOS. In this report, we characterize neuronal functions of its murine ortholog Ube3b. We show that Ube3b regulates dendritic branching in a cell-autonomous manner. Moreover, Ube3b knockout (KO) neurons exhibit increased density and aberrant morphology of dendritic spines, altered synaptic physiology and changes in hippocampal circuit activity. Dorsal forebrain-specific Ube3b KO animals show impaired spatial learning and alterations in social interactions. We further demonstrate that Ube3b ubiquitinates the catalytic {gamma}-subunit of calcineurin (Ppp3cc), the overexpression of which phenocopies the loss of Ube3b with regard to dendritic spine density. This work provides insights into the molecular pathologies underlying intellectual disability-like phenotypes in a genetic mouse model for KOS.",

    "abstract": "The Fisher-KPP model supports travelling wave solutions that are successfully used to model numerous invasive phenomena with applications in biology, ecology, and combustion theory. However, there are certain phenomena that the Fisher-KPP model cannot replicate, such as the extinction of invasive populations. The Fisher-Stefan model is an adaptation of the Fisher-KPP model to include a moving boundary whose evolution is governed by a Stefan condition. The Fisher-Stefan model also supports travelling wave solutions; however, a key additional feature of the Fisher-Stefan model is that it is able to simulate population extinction, giving rise to a spreading-extinction dichotomy. In this work, we revisit travelling wave solutions of the Fisher-KPP model and show that these results provide new insight into travelling wave solutions of the Fisher-Stefan model and the spreading-extinction dichotomy. Using a combination of phase plane analysis, perturbation analysis and linearisation, we establish a concrete relationship between travelling wave solutions of the Fisher-Stefan model and often-neglected travelling wave solutions of the Fisher-KPP model. Furthermore, we give closed-form approximate expressions for the shape of the travelling wave solutions of the Fisher-Stefan model in the limit of slow travelling wave speeds, c << 1.",

    "abstract": "E2F8 is a transcriptional repressor that antagonizes the canonical cell cycle transcription factor E2F1. Despite the importance of this atypical E2F family member in cell cycle, apoptosis and cancer, we lack a complete description of the mechanisms that control its dynamics. To address this question, we developed a complementary set of static and dynamic cell-free systems of human origin, which recapitulate inter-mitotic and G1 phases, and a full transition from pro-metaphase to G1. This revealed an interlocking molecular switch controlling E2F8 degradation at mitotic exit, involving dephosphorylation of Cdk1 sites in E2F8 and the activation of APC/CCdh1, but not APC/CCdc20. Further, we revealed a differential stability of E2F8, accounting for its accumulation in late G1 while APC/CCdh1 is still active and suggesting a key role for APC/C in controlling G1-S transcription. Finally, we identified SCF-Cyclin F as the ubiquitin ligase controlling E2F8 in G2-phase. Altogether, our data provide new insights into the regulation of E2F8 throughout the cell cycle, illuminating an extensive coordination between phosphorylation, ubiquitination and transcription in promoting orderly cell cycle progression.",

    "abstract": "The extensive array of bHLH transcription factors and their combinations as dimers underpin the diversity of molecular function required for cell type specification during embryogenesis. The bHLH factor TWIST1 plays pleiotropic roles during development. However, which combinations of TWIST1 dimers are involved and what impact each dimer imposes on the gene regulation network controlled by TWIST1 remain elusive. In this work, proteomic profiling of human-TWIST1 expressing cell lines and transcriptome analysis of mouse cranial mesenchyme have revealed that TWIST1 homodimer and heterodimers with TCF3, TCF4 and TCF12 E-proteins are the predominant dimer combinations. Dimers formation or their balance are altered by disease-causing mutations in TWIST1 helix domains, which may account for the defective differentiation of the craniofacial mesenchyme observed in patients. Functional analyses of the loss and gain of TWIST1-E-protein dimer activity have revealed previously unappreciated roles in guiding lineage differentiation of embryonic stem cells: TWIST1-E-protein heterodimers activate the differentiation of mesoderm and neural crest cells which is accompanied by epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, while TWIST1 homodimers maintain the stem cells in a progenitor state and block entry to the endoderm lineage.",

    "abstract": "Frogs must have sharp hearing abilities during the warm summer months to successfully find mating partners. This study aims to understand how frog hair cell ribbon-type synapses preserve both sensitivity and temporal precision during temperature changes. We performed in vitro patch-clamp recordings of hair cells and their afferent fibers in bullfrog amphibian papillae under room (23-25{degrees}C) and high (30-33{degrees}C) temperature. Afferent fibers exhibited a wide heterogeneity in membrane input resistance (Rin) from 100 M{Omega} to 1000 M{Omega}, which may contribute to variations in spike threshold and firing frequency. At higher temperatures, most fibers increased their frequency of action potential firing due to an increase in spontaneous EPSC frequencies. Hair cell resting membrane potential (Vrest) remained surprisingly stable during temperature increases, although both inward Ca2+ current and outward K+ current increased in amplitude. This increase in Ca2+ current may explain the higher spontaneous EPSC frequencies. The larger \\\"leak currents\\\" at Vrest lowered Rin and produced higher electrical resonant frequencies. However, lower Rin should decrease sensitivity to sound detection via smaller receptor potentials. Using membrane capacitance measurements, we suggest that hair cells can partially compensate for this reduced sensitivity by increasing exocytosis efficiency and the size of the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles. Furthermore, paired recordings of hair cells and their afferent fibers showed that synaptic delays become shorter and multivesicular release becomes more synchronous at higher temperatures, which should improve temporal precision. Altogether, our results explain many previous in vivo observations on the temperature dependence of spikes in auditory nerves.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe vertebrate inner ear detects and transmits auditory information over a broad dynamic range of sound frequency and intensity. It achieves remarkable sensitivity to soft sounds and precise frequency selectivity. How does the ear of cold-blooded vertebrates maintain its performance level as temperature changes? More specifically, how does the hair cell to afferent fiber synapse in bullfrog amphibian papilla adjust to a wide range of physiological temperatures without losing its sensitivity and temporal fidelity to sound signals? This study uses in vitro experiments to reveal the biophysical mechanisms that explain many observations made from in vivo auditory nerve fiber recordings. We find that higher temperature facilitates vesicle exocytosis and electrical tuning to higher sound frequencies, which benefits sensitivity and selectivity.",
