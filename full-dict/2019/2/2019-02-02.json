    "abstract": "Swarmer cells of the gram-negative pathogenic bacteria Proteus mirabilis and Vibrio parahaemolyticus become long (>10-100 m) and multinucleate during their growth and motility on polymer surfaces. We demonstrate increasing cell length is accompanied by a large increase in flexibility. Using a microfluidic assay to measure single-cell mechanics, we identified large differences in swarmer cell stiffness of (bending rigidity of P. mirabilis, 9.6 x 10-22 N m2; V. parahaemolyticus, 9.7 x 10-23 N m2) compared to vegetative cells (1.4 x 10-20 N m2 and 3.2 x 10-22 N m2, respectively). The reduction in bending rigidity (~3-15 fold) was accompanied by a decrease in the average polysaccharide strand length of the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall from 28-30 to 19-22 disaccharides. Atomic force microscopy revealed a reduction in P. mirabilis peptidoglycan thickness from 1.5 nm (vegetative) to 1.0 nm (swarmer) and electron cryotomography indicated changes in swarmer cell wall morphology. P. mirabilis and V. parahaemolyticus swarmer cells became increasingly sensitive to osmotic pressure and susceptible to cell wall-modifying antibiotics (compared to vegetative cells)--they were ~30% more likely to die after 3 h of treatment with minimum inhibitory concentrations of the {beta}-lactams cephalexin and penicillin G. The adaptive cost of swarming is offset by the increase in cell susceptibility to physical and chemical changes in their environment, thereby suggesting the development of new chemotherapies for bacteria that leverage swarming for colonization of hosts and survival.\n\nImportanceProteus mirabilis and Vibrio parahaemolyticus are bacteria that infect humans. To adapt to environmental changes, these bacteria alter their cell morphology and move collectively to access new sources of nutrients in a process referred to as  swarming. We found that a change in the composition and thickness of the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall makes swarmer cells of P. mirabilis and V. parahaemolyticus more flexible (i.e., reduced cell stiffness) and increases their sensitivity to osmotic pressure and cell-wall targeting antibiotics (e.g., {beta}-lactams). These results highlight the importance of assessing the extracellular environment in determining antibiotic doses and the use of {beta}-lactams antibiotics for treating infections caused by swarmer cells of P. mirabilis and V. parahaemolyticus.",

    "abstract": "Human contrast discrimination performance is limited by transduction nonlinearities and variability of the neural representation (noise). Whereas the nonlinearities have been well-characterised, there is less agreement about the specifics of internal noise. Psychophysical models assume that it impacts late in sensory processing, whereas neuroimaging and intracranial electrophysiology studies suggest that the noise is much earlier. We investigated whether perceptually-relevant internal noise arises in early visual areas or later decision making areas. We recorded EEG and MEG during a two-interval-forced-choice contrast discrimination task and used multivariate pattern analysis to decode target/non-target and selected/non-selected intervals from evoked responses. We found that perceptual decisions could be decoded from both EEG and MEG signals, even when the stimuli in both intervals were physically identical. Above-chance decision classification started <100ms after stimulus onset, suggesting that neural noise affects sensory signals early in the visual pathway. Classification accuracy increased over time, peaking at >500ms. Applying multivariate analysis to separate anatomically-defined brain regions in MEG source space, we found that occipital regions were informative early on but then information spreads forwards across parietal and frontal regions. This is consistent with neural noise affecting sensory processing at multiple stages of perceptual decision making. We suggest how early sensory noise might be resolved with Birdsalls linearisation, in which a dominant noise source obscures subsequent nonlinearities, to allow the visual system to preserve the wide dynamic range of early areas whilst still benefitting from contrast-invariance at later stages.

    "abstract": "Dopamine activity may transition between two patterns: phasic responses to reward-predicting cues and ramping activity arising when an agent approaches the reward. However, when and why dopamine activity transitions between these modes is not understood. We hypothesize that the transition between ramping and phasic patterns reflects resource allocation which addresses the task dimensionality problem during reinforcement learning (RL). By parsimoniously modifying a standard temporal difference (TD) learning model to accommodate a mixed presentation of both experimental and environmental stimuli, we simulated dopamine transitions and compared it with experimental data from four different studies. The results suggested that dopamine transitions from ramping to phasic patterns as the agent narrows down candidate stimuli for the task; the opposite occurs when the agent needs to re-learn candidate stimuli due to a value change. These results lend insight into how dopamine deals with the tradeoff between cognitive resource and task dimensionality during RL.",

    "abstract": "The presence of supernumerary centrosomes is prevalent in cancer, where they promote the formation of transient multipolar mitotic spindles. Active clustering of supernumerary centrosomes enables the formation of a functional bipolar spindle that is competent to complete a bipolar division. Disruption of spindle pole clustering in cancer cells promotes multipolar division and generation of non-proliferative daughter cells with compromised viability. Hence molecular pathways required for spindle pole clustering in cells with supernumerary centrosomes, but dispensable in normal cells, are promising therapeutic targets. Here we demonstrate that Aurora A kinase activity is required for spindle pole clustering in cells with extra centrosomes. While cells with two centrosomes are ultimately able to build a bipolar spindle and proceed through a normal cell division in the presence of Aurora A inhibition, cells with supernumerary centrosomes form multipolar and disorganized spindles that are not competent for chromosome segregation. Instead, following a prolonged mitosis, these cells experience catastrophic divisions that result in grossly aneuploid, and non-proliferative daughter cells. Aurora A inhibition in a panel of Acute Myeloid Leukemia cancer cells has a similarly disparate impact on cells with supernumerary centrosomes, suggesting that centrosome number and spindle polarity may serve as predictive biomarkers for response to therapeutic approaches that target Aurora A kinase function.",

    "abstract": "To date, investigations of executive function (EF) have focused on the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and prominent theories of EF are framed with respect to this brain region. Multiple theories describe a hierarchical functional organization for the lateral PFC. However, recent evidence has indicated that the cerebellum (CB) also plays a role in EF. Posterior CB regions (Crus I & II) show structural and functional connections with the PFC, and CB networks are associated with individual differences in EF in healthy adults. However, it is unclear whether the cerebellum shows a similar functional gradient as does the PFC. Here, we investigated high-resolution resting-state data from 225 participants in the Human Connectome Project. We compared resting-state connectivity from posterior cerebellar ROIs, and examined functional data from several tasks that activate the lateral PFC. Demonstrating preliminary evidence for parallel PFC and CB gradients, Crus I was functionally connected with rostrolateral PFC, Crus II with middle and ventral PFC, and Lobule VI with posterior PFC. Contrary to previous work, the activation of the task thought to activate rostrolateral PFC resembled the connectivity maps of Crus II, not Crus I; similarly, the activation of the task thought to activate middle PFC resembled the connectivity maps of Crus I, not Crus II. Nevertheless, there was evidence for dissociable CB-PFC networks. Further work is necessary to understand the functional role of these networks.",

Here we developed a computational approach for estimating sulcal width and depth that relies on cortical surface reconstructions output by FreeSurfer. While other approaches for estimating sulcal morphology exist, studies often require the use of multiple brain morphology programs that have been shown to differ in their approaches to localize sulcal landmarks, yielding morphological estimates based on inconsistent boundaries. To demonstrate the approach, sulcal morphology was estimated in three large sample of adults across the lifespan, in relation to aging. A fourth sample is additionally used to estimate test-retest reliability of the approach.

    "abstract": "Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signaling pathways have well established roles in skeletal development, with essential functions in both chondrogenesis and osteogenesis. In mice, previous conditional knockout studies suggested distinct roles for FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) signaling at different stages of osteogenesis and a role for FGFR2 in osteoblast maturation. However, the potential for redundancy among FGFRs and the mechanisms and consequences of stage-specific osteoblast lineage regulation were not addressed. Here, we conditionally inactivate Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 in mature osteoblasts with an Osteocalcin-Cre or Dentin matrix protein 1-CreER driver. We find that young mice lacking both receptors or only FGFR1 are phenotypically normal. However, after 6 weeks of age these Fgfr1/Fgfr2 double- and Fgfr1 single-conditional knockout mice develop a high bone mass phenotype with increased periosteal apposition, increased endocortical woven bone with increased porosity, and biomechanical properties that reflect increased bone mass but impaired material properties. Histopathological and gene expression analyses show that this phenotype is preceded by a striking loss of osteocytes, and gradual activation of the Wnt/{beta}Catenin signaling pathway. These data identify a role for FGFR1 signaling in mature osteoblasts/osteocytes that is required for osteocyte survival during postnatal bone growth.",

    "abstract": "Measuring the brains response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with electroencephalography (EEG) offers a unique insight into the local cortical circuits and networks activated following stimulation, particularly in non-motor regions where less is known about TMS physiology. However, the mechanisms underlying TMS-evoked EEG potentials (TEPs) remain largely unknown. We assessed TEP reliability, site-specificity, and sensitivity to changes in excitatory neurotransmission mediated by n-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors following stimulation of non-motor regions. In fourteen male volunteers, resting EEG and TEPs from prefrontal (PFC) and parietal (PAR) cortex were measured before and after administration of either dextromethorphan (an NMDA receptor antagonist) or placebo across two sessions separated by at least a week in a double-blinded pseudo-randomised crossover design. At baseline, TEPs showed lower within-than between-subject variability for both stimulation sites across sessions, demonstrating the reliability of non-motor TEPs within individuals. There were differences in amplitude between PFC and PAR TEPs across a wide time range (15-250 ms), however the signals were correlated after ~80 ms, suggesting that early peaks reflect site-specific activity, whereas late peaks reflect activity patterns less dependent on the stimulated sites. TEPs were not altered following dextromethorphan compared to placebo, however low frequency resting oscillations were reduced in power. Our findings suggest that TEPs from PFC and PAR: 1) are reliable within and variable between individuals; 2) reflect stimulation site specific activity across early time periods (<80 ms); and 3) are not sensitive to changes in NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission.",

In plants and animals with mosaic genomic methylation, functionally mysterious methylation is also common within constitutively active housekeeping genes. Here we show that H1 is enriched in methylated sequences, including genes, of Arabidopsis thaliana, yet this enrichment is independent of DNA methylation.

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn newborns, severe congenital heart defects are rarer than mild ones. The reason why is unknown, but presumably related to a liability threshold that rises with the severity of a defect. Because the same genetic mutation can cause different defects, other variables may contribute to pushing an individual past a defect-specific liability threshold. We consider here how variables in the genetic architecture of a heart defect depend upon its fitness cost, as defined by the likelihood of survival to reproductive age in natural history studies.\n\nMethodsWe phenotyped ~10,000 Nkx2-5+/- newborn mice, a model of human congenital heart disease, from two inbred strain crosses. Genome-wide association analyses detected loci that modify the risk of an atrial septal defect, membranous or muscular ventricular septal defect, or atrioventricular septal defect. The number of loci, heritability and quantitative effects on risk of pairwise (GxGNkx) and higher-order (GxGxGNkx) epistasis between the loci and Nkx2-5 mutation were examined as a function of the fitness cost of a defect.\n\nResultsNkx2-5+/- mice have pleiotropic heart defects; about 70% have normal hearts. The model recapitulates the epidemiological relationship between the severity and incidence of a heart defect. Neither the number of modifier loci nor heritability depends upon the severity of a defect, but GxGNkx and GxGxGNkx effects on risk do. Interestingly, GxGxGNkx effects are three times more likely to suppress risk when the genotypes at the first two loci are homozygous and from the same, rather than opposite strains in a cross. Syn- and anti-homozygous genotypes at GxGxGNkx interactions can have an especially large impact on the risk of an atrioventricular septal defect.\n\nConclusionsGiven a modestly penetrant mutation, epistasis contributes more to the risk of severe than mild congenital heart defect. Conversely, genetic compatibility between interacting genes, as indicated by the protective effects of syn-homozygosity at GxGxGNkx interactions, plays a newfound role in the robustness of cardiac development. The experimental model offers practical insights into the nature of genetic risk in congenital heart disease. The results more fundamentally address a longstanding question regarding how mutational robustness could arise from natural selection.",

    "abstract": "The Pseudomonas syringae acetyltransferase HopZ1a is delivered directly into host cells by the type III secretion system to promote bacterial growth. However, in the model plant host Arabidopsis thaliana, HopZ1a activity results in an effector-triggered immune response (ETI) that limits bacterial proliferation. HopZ1a-triggered immunity requires the nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat domain (NLR) protein, ZAR1, and the ZED1 pseudokinase. Here we demonstrate that HopZ1a can acetylate members of a family of  receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCK family VII; also known as PBS1-like kinases, or PBLs) and promote their interaction with ZED1 and ZAR1 to form a ZAR1/ZED1/PBL ternary complex. Interactions between ZED1 and PBL kinases are determined by the pseudokinase features of ZED1, and mutants designed to restore ZED1 kinase motifs can (1) bind to PBLs, (2) recruit ZAR1, and (3) trigger immunity in planta, all independently of HopZ1a. Our results suggest that interactions between these two RLCK families are promoted by perturbations of structural features that distinguish active from inactive kinase domain conformations. We propose that effector-induced interactions between ZED1/ZRK pseudokinases (RLCK family XII) and PBL kinases (RLCK family VII) provide a sensitive mechanism for detecting perturbations of either kinase family and activating ZAR1-mediated ETI.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYAll plants must ward off potentially infectious microbes, and those grown in large-scale crop operations are especially vulnerable to the rapid spread of disease by successful pathogens. Although many bacteria and fungi can supress plant immune responses by producing specialized virulence proteins called  effectors, these effectors can also trigger immune responses that render plants resistant to infection. We studied the molecular mechanisms underlying one such effector-triggered immune response elicited by the bacterial effector HopZ1a in the model plant host Arabidopsis thaliana. We have shown that HopZ1a promotes binding between a ZED1, a  pseudokinase required for HopZ1a-triggered immunity, and several  true kinases (known as PBLs) that are likely targets of HopZ1a activity in planta. HopZ1a-induced ZED1-PBL interactions also recruit ZAR1, an Arabidopsis  resistance protein previously implicated in HopZ1a-triggered immunity. Importantly, ZED1 mutants that restore degenerate kinase motifs can bridge interactions between PBLs and ZAR1 (independently of HopZ1a) and trigger immunity in planta. Our results suggest that equilibria between active and inactive kinase domain conformations regulate ZED1-PBL interactions and formation of ternary complexes with ZAR1. Improved models describing molecular interactions between immunity determinants, effectors and effector targets will inform efforts to exploit natural diversity for development of crops with enhanced disease resistance.",

The contribution of each H-bond interaction in -helices was estimated in detail from the entire conformation energies, and the results were compared with those in the minimal H-bond models, in which only H-bond donors and acceptors exist with the capping methyl groups. Consequently, the former interaction energies were always significantly weaker than the latter energies, when the same geometries of the H-bond donors and acceptors were applied. The chemical origin of this phenomenon was investigated by analyzing the differences among the electronic structures of the local peptide backbones of the -helices and those of the minimal H-bond models. Consequently, we found that the reduced H-bond energy originated from the depolarizations of both the H-bond donor and acceptor groups, due to the repulsive interactions with the neighboring polar peptide groups in the -helix backbone. The classical force-fields provide similar H-bond energies to those in the minimal H-bond models, which ignore the current depolarization effect, and thus they overestimate the actual H-bond energies in -helices.",

    "abstract": "The Bithynia snails of B. funiculata, B. siamensis siamensis and B. siamensis goniomphalos, are first intermediate hosts of Opisthorchis viverrini. The success of parasitic infection in snails is related to the host species and efficiency of their internal defense system. Parasitic infections in snails exhibited significant variations in the number of hemocytes in hemolymph. This study investigated hemocyte counts in Bithynia snails for various durations of O. viverrini infection. The three species/subspecies snails were infected with O. viverrini and hemocytes were counted at post-exposed periods of 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96 h, and 1, 4 and 8 wk to evaluate the hemocyte response to the infection. Three major hemocyte morphotypes, namely, agranulocytes, semigranulocytes and granulocytes, were observed. After infection, the differential hemocyte morphotype counts in all species/subspecies significantly increased in granulocytes at 2 h (p < 0.05) and decreased in semigranulocytes and agranulocytes at 2 to 4 h (p < 0.05). The total hemocyte counts were significant increased at 2 h after exposure in B. s. siamensis and B. funiculata (p < 0.05). Additionally, the number of hemocytes was reduced after exposure at 4, 6 and 12 h in B. s. goniomphalos and at 12, 24 and 48 h in B. funiculata (p < 0.05). From 96 h to 8 wk, the number of hemocytes was reestablished in the hemolymph, indicating that defensive cells in the host species have different mechanisms for their susceptibility or resistance to parasitic infections. Further studies on molecular functions will be done.",

    "abstract": "Development of the vertebrate eye, like many developmental systems, depends on genes that are used iteratively in multiple distinct processes. The OTX2 transcription factor is one such gene, with a requirement for eye formation, photoreceptor formation, and retinal pigment epithelium specification, among others. Recent evidence has suggested that OTX2 is also expressed in subsets of retinal progenitor cells with restricted fate choices. However, given the multiple roles for OTX2 and limitations of conventional conditional knockout strategies, the functional significance of this expression is unknown. Here we use CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to produce mutations of OTX2, identifying similar phenotypes to those observed in human patients. In addition, we use single cell RNA sequencing to determine the functional consequences of OTX2 gene editing by CRISPR/Cas9 on the population of cells derived from OTX2-expressing retinal progenitor cells. We not only confirm that OTX2 is required for the generation of photoreceptors, but also for maintaining the proliferative potential of cells and suppressing the formation of specific retinal fates. These include subtypes of retinal ganglion and horizontal cells normally associated with these progenitor types, suggesting that in this context OTX2 functions to repress sister cell fate choices. Upregulation of key transcription factors involved in the formation of these cells was observed suggesting that OTX2 is upstream of critical nodes of gene regulatory networks of these alternative fates.",

The mechanism of cell killing depends upon DNMT1, but is otherwise not clearly defined. Here we show that PARP1 forms covalent DNA adducts in human lymphoblast or fibroblasts treated with 5-aza-dC. Some adducts recovered from 5-aza-dC-treated cells have undergone cleavage by apoptotic caspases 3/7. Mapping of PARP1-DNA adducts, by a new method, \"Adduct-Seq\", demonstrates adduct enrichment at CpG-dense genomic locations that are targets of maintenance methylation by DNMT1. Covalent protein-DNA adducts can arrest replication and induce apoptosis, and these results raise the possibility that induction of PARP1-DNA adducts may contribute to cell killing in response to treatment with 5-aza-dC.",

A challenge in realizing this potential is that the conditions for keeping cells alive are not conducive to materials processing and require a continuous source of water and nutrients. Here, we present a 3D printer that can mix material and cell streams in a novel printhead and build 3D objects (up to 2.5 cm by 1 cm by 1 cm). Hydrogels are printed using 5% agarose, which has a low melting temperature (65{degrees}C) consistent with thermophilic cells, a rigid storage modulus (G= 6.5 x 104), exhibits shear thinning, and can be rapidly hardened upon cooling to preserve structural features. Spores of B. subtilis are printed within the material and germinate on its exterior, including spontaneously in cracks and new surfaces exposed by tears. By introducing genetically engineered bacteria, the materials can sense chemicals (IPTG, xylose, or vanillic acid). Further, we show that the spores are resilient to extreme environmental stresses, including desiccation, solvents (ethanol), high osmolarity (1.5 mM NaCl), 365 nm UV light, and {gamma}-radiation (2.6 kGy). The construction of 3D printed materials containing spores enables the living functions to be used for applications that require long-term storage, in-field functionality, or exposure to uncertain environmental stresses.",

Despite their importance and their potential use in cell-based therapies for retinal diseases, there is a lack of knowledge about the early developmental stages of these cells. Here we characterize the expression of the homeobox transcription factor Lhx4 as an early and enriched cone photoreceptor expressed gene in both chicken and mouse. A Lhx4 GFP reporter mouse was found to recapitulate this early cone photoreceptor expression and was used to purify and profile embryonic mouse cone photoreceptors by single cell RNA sequencing. This enrichment in cone photoreceptors allowed for the robust identification of genes associated with the early cone transcriptome and also identified subpopulations of these cells. A comparison to previously reported datasets allowed the classification of genes according to developmental timing, cell type specificity, and whether they were regulated by the rod transcription factor Nrl. This analysis has extended the set of known early cone enriched genes and identified those that are regulated independently of Nrl. This report furthers our knowledge of the transcriptional events that occur in early cone photoreceptors.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveOxidative stress contributes to the development of insulin resistance (IR) and atherosclerosis. Peroxidation of lipids produces reactive dicarbonyls such as Isolevuglandins (IsoLG) and malondialdehyde (MDA) that covalently bind plasma/cellular proteins, phospholipids, and DNA leading to altered function and toxicity. We examined whether scavenging reactive dicarbonyls with 5-O-pentyl-pyridoxamine (PPM) protects against the development of IR and atherosclerosis in Ldlr-/- mice.\n\nMethodsMale or female Ldlr-/- mice were fed a western diet (WD) for 16 weeks and treated with PPM versus vehicle alone. Plaque extent, dicarbonyl-lysyl adducts, efferocytosis, apoptosis, macrophage inflammation, and necrotic area were measured. Plasma MDA-LDL adducts and the in vivo and in vitro effects of PPM on the ability of HDL to reduce macrophage cholesterol were measured. Blood Ly6Chi monocytes and ex vivo 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation into bone marrow CD11b+ monocytes and CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) were also examined. IR was examined by measuring fasting glucose/insulin levels and tolerance to insulin/glucose challenge.\n\nResultsPPM reduced the proximal aortic atherosclerosis by 48% and by 46% in female and male Ldlr-/- mice, respectively. PPM also decreased IR and hepatic fat and inflammation in male Ldlr-/- mice. Importantly, PPM decreased plasma MDA-LDL adducts and prevented the accumulation of plaque MDA- and IsoLG-lysyl adducts in Ldlr-/- mice. In addition, PPM increased the net cholesterol efflux capacity of HDL from Ldlr-/- mice and prevented both the in vitro impairment of HDL net cholesterol efflux capacity and apoAI crosslinking by MPO generated hypochlorous acid. Moreover, PPM decreased features of plaque instability including decreased proinflammatory M1-like macrophages, IL-1{beta} expression, myeloperoxidase, apoptosis, and necrotic core. In contrast, PPM increased M2-like macrophages, Tregs, fibrous cap thickness, and efferocytosis. Furthermore, PPM reduced inflammatory monocytosis as evidenced by decreased blood Ly6Chi monocytes and proliferation of bone marrow monocytes and HSPC from Ldlr-/- mice.\n\nConclusionsPPM has pleotropic atheroprotective effects in a murine model of familial hypercholesterolemia, supporting the therapeutic potential of reactive dicarbonyl scavenging in the treatment of IR and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.",

    "abstract": "O_LIPhylogenies with extensive taxon sampling have become indispensable for many types of ecological and evolutionary studies. Many large-scale trees are based on a \"supermatrix\" approach, which involves amalgamating thousands of published sequences for a group. Constructing up-to-date supermatrices can be challenging, especially as new sequences may become available almost constantly. Additionally, genomic datasets (composed of thousands of loci) are becoming common in phylogenetics and phylogeography, and present novel challenges for constructing such datasets.\nC_LIO_LIHere we present SuperCRUNCH, a Python toolkit for assembling large phylogenetic datasets. It can be applied to GenBank sequences, unpublished sequences, or combinations of GenBank and unpublished data. SuperCRUNCH constructs local databases and uses them to conduct rapid searches for user-specified sets of taxa and loci. Sequences are parsed into putative loci and passed through rigorous filtering steps. A post-filtering step allows for selection of one sequence per taxon (i.e. species-level supermatrix) or retention of all sequences per taxon (i.e. population-level dataset). Importantly, SuperCRUNCH can generate \"vouchered\" population-level datasets, in which voucher information is used to generate multi-locus phylogeographic datasets. SuperCRUNCH offers many options for taxonomy resolution, similarity filtering, sequence selection, alignment, and file manipulation.\nC_LIO_LIWe demonstrate the range of features available in SuperCRUNCH by generating a variety of phylogenetic datasets. Output datasets include traditional species-level supermatrices, large-scale phylogenomic matrices, and phylogeographic datasets. Finally, we briefly compare the ability of SuperCRUNCH to construct species-level supermatrices to alternative approaches. SuperCRUNCH generated a large-scale supermatrix (1,400 taxa and 66 loci) from 16GB of GenBank data in [~]1.5 hours, and generated population-level datasets (<350 samples, <10 loci) in <1 minute. It outperformed alternative methods for supermatrix construction in terms of taxa, loci, and sequences recovered.\nC_LIO_LISuperCRUNCH is a modular bioinformatics toolkit that can be used to assemble datasets for any taxonomic group and scale (kingdoms to individuals). It allows rapid construction of supermatrices, greatly simplifying the process of updating large phylogenies with new data. It is also designed to produce population-level datasets. SuperCRUNCH streamlines the major tasks required to process phylogenetic data, including filtering, alignment, trimming, and formatting. SuperCRUNCH is open-source, documented, and available at https://github.com/dportik/SuperCRUNCH.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "MotivationThere are now over 500 ontologies in the life sciences. Over the past years, significant resources have been invested into formalizing these biomedical ontologies. Formal axioms in ontologies have been developed and used to detect and ensure ontology consistency, find unsatisfiable classes, improve interoperability, guide ontology extension through the application of axiom-based design patterns, and encode domain background knowledge. At the same time, ontologies have extended their amount of human-readable information such as labels and definitions as well as other meta-data. As a consequence, biomedical ontologies now form large formalized domain knowledge bases and have a potential to improve ontology-based data analysis by providing background knowledge and relations between biological entities that are not otherwise connected.\n\nResultsWe evaluate the contribution of formal axioms and ontology meta-data to the ontology-based prediction of protein-protein interactions and gene-disease associations. We find that the formal axioms that have been created for the Gene Ontology and several other ontologies significantly improve ontology-based prediction models through provision of domain-specific background knowledge. Furthermore, we find that the labels, synonyms and definitions in ontologies can also provide background knowledge that may be exploited for prediction. The axioms and meta-data of different ontologies contribute in varying degrees to improving data analysis. Our results have major implications on the further development of formal knowledge bases and ontologies in the life sciences, in particular as machine learning methods are more frequently being applied. Our findings clearly motivate the need for further development, and the systematic, application-driven evaluation and improvement, of formal axioms in ontologies.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/tsoe\n\nContactrobert.hoehndorf@kaust.edu.sa, xin.gao@kaust.edu.sa",

Experimental investigation of this dynamic requires the ability to manipulate components of the system, ideally in as close to an in vivo context as possible. Here we use electroporation of plasmid reporters to define critical parameters of a specific cis-regulatory element, ThrbCRM1, during retinal development. ThrbCRM1 is associated with cone photoreceptor genesis and activated in a subset of developing retinal cells that co-express the Otx2 and Onecut1 (OC1) transcription factors. Variation of reporter plasmid concentration was used to generate dose response curves and revealed an effect of binding site availability on the number and strength of cells with reporter activity. Critical sequence elements of the ThrbCRM1 element were defined using both mutagenesis and misexpression of the Otx2 and OC1 transcription factors in the developing retina. Additionally, these experiments suggest that the ThrbCRM1 element is co-regulated by Otx2 and OC1 even under conditions of sub-optimal binding of OC1.\n\nSummary StatementSystematic variation of the levels of a transcriptional reporter plasmid, its trans-acting factors, and transcription factor binding sites reveals properties of a retinal enhancer during development.",

    "abstract": "Urgency urinary incontinence (UUI), the result of conditions such as overactive bladder (OAB), could potentially be influenced by both commensal and urinary tract infection-associated bacteria. The sensing of bladder filling involves interplay between various parts of the nervous system eventually resulting in contraction of the detrusor muscle during micturition. Here we model host responses to various urogenital bacteria, firstly by using urothelial bladder cell lines and then with myofibroblast contraction assays. To measure responses, we examined calcium influx, gene expression and alpha smooth muscle actin deposition assays. We found that organisms such as Escherichia coli and Gardnerella vaginalis strongly induced calcium influx and contraction, whereas, Lactobacillus crispatus and L. gasseri did not induce this response. Additionally, supernatants from lactobacilli impeded influx-and contraction induced by the uropathogens. Upon further investigation of factors associated with the purinergic signaling pathways, we found that influx and contraction of cells correlated to the amount of extracellular ATP produced by E. coli. Certain lactobacilli appear to mitigate this response by utilizing extracellular ATP or producing inhibitory compounds which can act as a receptor agonist or calcium channel blocker. These findings suggest that members of the urinary microbiota may be influencing UUI.",

    "abstract": "Phytohormones are pivotal in the regulation of plant growth and development, and acclimation to adverse environments. Multiple cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYP450s) are involved in the biosynthesis and catabolism of phytohormones. Here, we reported that a CYP450 member of CYP71 clan, OsCYP71D8L, participated in the control of multiple agronomic traits and abiotic stress responses by affecting gibberellin (GA) and cytokinin (CK) homeostasis in rice. We found that its gain-of-function mutant (cyp71d8l) and transgenic plants overexpressing OsCYP71D8L (OsCYP71D8L-OE) displayed similar phenotypes such as dwarfed plant, reduced panicle length and grain number per panicle. In OsCYP71D8L-OE seedlings, endogenous GAs and CKs was notably decreased and increased as compared with wild type (WT), respectively. Correspondingly, the dwarfed plant and less developed root of cyp71d8l and OsCYP71D8L-OE seedlings could be rescued by exogenous GA3, but more exacerbated by exogenous 6-BA. Importantly, cyp71d8l and OsCYP71D8L-OE seedlings maintained high chlorophyll contents and low reactive oxygen species level, and showed significantly enhanced tolerances to drought and high salt compared with WT. Thus, our results suggest that OsCYP71D8L plays roles in regulating rice growth and stress responses by coordinating GAs and CKs homeostasis, and it is useful to engineer stress-tolerant rice.",

    "abstract": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a 7.2 kb positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus containing three partially overlapping reading frames, ORF 1-3. All non-structural proteins required for viral replication are encoded by ORF1 and are transcribed as a single transcript. Computational analysis of the complete ORF1 polyprotein identified a previously uncharacterized region of predicted secondary structure bordered by two disordered regions coinciding partially with a region predicted as a putative cysteine protease. Following successful cloning, expression and purification of this region, the crystal structure of the identified protein was determined and identified to have considerable structural homology to a fatty acid binding domain. Further analysis of the structure revealed a metal binding site, shown unambiguously to specifically bind zinc via a non-classical, potentially catalytic zinc-binding motif. We present analysis for the first time of this identified non-structural protein, expanding the knowledge and understanding of the complex mechanisms of HEV biology.\n\nImportanceHepatitis E virus (HEV) is an emerging virus found predominately in developing countries causing an estimated 20 million infections, which result in approximately 57,000 deaths a year. Although it is known that the non-structural proteins of the HEV ORF1 are expressed as a single transcript, there is debate as to whether ORF1 functions as a single polyprotein or if it is processed into separate domains via a viral or endogenous cellular protease. In the following paper, we present the first structural and biophysical characterization of a HEV non-structural protein using a construct that has partially overlapping boundaries with the predicted putative cysteine protease. Based on the structural homology of the HEV protein with known structures, along with the presence of a catalytic zinc-binding motif, it is possible that the identified protein corresponds to the HEV protease, which could require activation or repression through the binding of a fatty acid. This represents a significant step forward in the characterization and the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the HEV genome.",

C. elegans synMuv B proteins are important for the soma/germline fate decision and mutants demonstrate ectopic germline gene expression in somatic tissue, especially at high temperature. We show that C. elegans synMuv B proteins regulate developmental chromatin compaction and that timing of chromatin compaction is temperature sensitive in both wild-type and synMuv B mutants. Chromatin compaction in mutants is delayed into developmental time-periods when zygotic gene expression is upregulated and demonstrates an anterior-to-posterior pattern. Loss of this patterned compaction coincides with the developmental time-period of ectopic germline gene expression that leads to a developmental arrest in synMuv B mutants. Thus, chromatin organization throughout development is regulated both spatially and temporally by synMuv B proteins to establish repressive chromatin in a tissue-specific manner to ensure proper gene expression.",

We focused on a species that exhibits split sex-ratio and found significant quantitative differences between virgin queens and their potential mates.

    "abstract": "Pediatric HIV infection remains a large global health concern despite the widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Thus, global elimination of pediatric HIV infections will require the development of novel immune-based approaches, and understanding infant immunity to HIV is critical to guide the rational design of these intervention strategies. Despite their immunological immaturity, HIV-infected children develop broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) more frequently and earlier than adults do. Furthermore, T-follicular helper (Tfh) cells have been associated with bnAb development in HIV-infected children and adults. To further our understanding of age-related differences in the development of HIV-specific immunity, we evaluated the generation of virus-specific humoral immune responses in infant (n=6) and adult (n=12) rhesus macaques (RMs) infected with a transmitted/founder (T/F) simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV.C.CH505). The plasma HIV envelope-specific IgG antibody kinetics were similar in SHIV-infected infant and adult RMs, with no significant differences in the magnitude or breadth of these responses. Interestingly, autologous tier 2 virus neutralization responses also developed with similar frequency and kinetics in infant and adult RMs, despite infants exhibiting significantly higher Tfh and germinal center B cell frequencies compared to adults. Our results indicate that the humoral immune response to SHIV infection develops with similar kinetics among infant and adult RMs, suggesting that the early life immune system is equipped to respond to HIV-1 and promote the production of neutralizing HIV antibodies.\n\nImportanceThere is a lack of understanding on how the maturation of the infant immune system influences immunity to HIV infection, or how these responses differ from those of adults. Improving our knowledge of infant HIV immunity will help guide antiviral intervention strategies that take advantage of the unique infant immune environment to successfully elicit protective immune responses. We utilized a rhesus macaque model of SHIV infection as a tool to distinguish the differences in HIV humoral immunity in infants versus adults. Here, we demonstrate that the kinetics and quality of the infant humoral immune response to HIV are highly comparable to that of adults during the early phase of infection, despite distinct differences in their Tfh responses, indicating that slightly different mechanisms may drive infant and adult humoral immunity.",

    "abstract": "Marine microbes including viruses are an essential part of the marine ecosystem that forms the base of the foodweb, and drives biogeochemical cycles. Marine viral communities display repeatable changes in abundance and community composition throughout time; however, whether these changes reflect shifts in dominance within evolutionarily related groups of viruses and their hosts is unexplored. To examine these dynamics, changes in the composition and phylogenetic makeup of two ecologically important groups of viruses, and their potential hosts, were sampled every two weeks for 13 months at a coastal site in British Columbia, Canada. Changes in the taxonomic composition within DNA bacteriophages related to T4-like viruses and marnavirus-like RNA viruses infecting eukaryotic phytoplankton, as well as bacteria and eukaryotes, were examined using amplicon sequencing of gene fragments encoding the major capsid protein (gp23), the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the 16S and 18S ribosomes, respectively. The results showed that for both viral marker genes, the dominant groups of phylogenetically-related viruses shifted over time and contained many transient taxa and few persistent taxa; yet, different community structures were observed in these different viral communities. Additionally, with strong lagged correlations between viral richness and community similarity of putative hosts, the results imply that viruses influence the composition of the host communities.\n\nImportanceUsing high-throughput sequencing of coastal seawater collected every two weeks for one year, the dynamics of two groups of ecologically important groups of viruses were described in the context of their putative hosts and the environment. There was a large diversity of viruses and putative hosts in this study, and groups of phylogenetically-related viruses showed temporal dynamics in dominance. Examining the richness of viruses by phylogenetic groups showed different dynamics of either boom-bust or continued persistence. At the OTU-level, some members of these related groups persisted throughout time, while others were more ephemeral. These findings were put in context of potential quasispecies behaviour, and the dynamics of putative hosts. These results showed that temporal dynamics of viral communities have a phylogenetic signal which is important for understanding the ecology of these viruses since it elucidated one of the drivers of the community structure.",

    "abstract": "MotivationSynapses are essential to neural signal transmission. Therefore, quantification of synapses and related neurites from images is vital to gain insights into the underlying pathways of brain functionality and diseases. Despite the wide availability of synapse imaging data, several issues prevent satisfactory quantification of these structures by current tools. First, the antibodies used for labeling synapses are not perfectly specific to synapses. These antibodies may exist in neurites or other cell compartments. Second, the brightness for different neurites and synapses is heterogeneous due to the variation of antibody concentration and synapse-intrinsic differences. Third, images often have low signal to noise ratio (SNR) due to constraints of experiments and availability of sensitive antibodies. The combination of these issues makes the detection of synapses challenging and necessitates developing a new tool to accurately and reliably quantify synapses.\n\nResultsWe present an automatic probability-principled synapse detection algorithm and integrate it into our synapse quantification tool SynQuant. Derived from the theory of order statistics, our method controls the false discovery rate and improves the power of detecting synapses. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real images in the presence of severe antibody diffusion, high heterogeneity, and large noise, our method was demonstrated to outperform peer specialized synapse detection tools as well as generic spot detection methods by a large margin. Finally, we show SynQuant reliably uncovers statistically significant differences between disease and control conditions in a neuron-astrocyte co-culture based model of Down Syndrome.\n\nAvailabilityThe Java source code, Fiji plug-in, and test data are available at https://github.com/yu-lab-vt/SynQuant.\n\nContactyug@vt.edu",

    "abstract": "Plant bioengineering may generate high yielding and stress-resistant crops amidst a changing climate and a growing global population (1-3). However, delivery of biomolecules to plants relies on Agrobacterium infection (4) or biolistic particle delivery (5), the former of which is only amenable to DNA delivery. The difficulty in delivering functional biomolecules such as RNA to plant cells is due to the plant cell wall which is absent in mammalian cells and poses the dominant physical barrier to exogenous biomolecule delivery in plants. DNA nanostructure-mediated biomolecule delivery is an effective strategy to deliver cargoes across the lipid bilayer of mammalian cells, however, nanoparticle-mediated delivery remains unexplored for passive biomolecule delivery across the cell wall in plants. Herein, we report a systematic assessment of different DNA nanostructures for their ability to internalize into cells of mature plants, deliver small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and effectively silence a constitutively-expressed gene in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. We show that nanostructure internalization into plant cells and the corresponding gene silencing efficiency depends on the DNA nanostructure size, shape, compactness, stiffness, and location of the siRNA attachment locus on the nanostructure. We further confirm that the internalization efficiency of DNA nanostructures correlates with their respective gene silencing efficiencies, but that the endogenous gene silencing pathway depends on the siRNA attachment locus. Our work establishes the feasibility of biomolecule delivery to plants with DNA nanostructures, and details both the design parameters of importance for plant cell internalization, and also assesses the impact of DNA nanostructure geometry for gene silencing mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Reliable propagation of firing rate - specifically slow modulation of asynchronous spikes in fairly short time windows [20-500]ms across multiple layers of a feedforward network (FFN) receiving background synaptic noise has proven difficult to capture in spiking models. We, in this paper, explore how information of asynchronous spikes disrupted in the first layer of a typical FFN, and which factors can enable reliable information representation. Our rationale is that the reliable propagation of information across layers of a FFN is likely if that information can be preserved in the first layer of the FFN. In a typical FFN, each layer comprises a certain number (network size) of excitatory neurons - leaky integrate and fire (LIF) model neuron in this paper - receiving correlated input (common stimulus from the upstream layer) plus independent background synaptic noise. We develop a reduced network model of FFN which captures main features of a conventional all-to-all connected FFN. Exploiting the reduced network model, synaptic weights are calculated using a closed-form optimization framework that minimizes the mean squared error between reconstructed stimulus (by spikes of the first layer of FFN) and the original common stimulus. We further explore how representation of asynchronous spikes in a FFN changes with respect to other factors like the network size and the level of background synaptic noise while synaptic weights are optimized for each scenario. We show that not only synaptic weights but also the network size and the level of background synaptic noise are crucial to preserve a reliable representation of asynchronous spikes in the first layer of a FFN. This work sheds light in better understanding of how information of slowly time-varying fluctuations of the firing rate can be transmitted in multi-layered FFNs.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression profiles provide insight into how microorganisms respond to changing environmental conditions. However, few studies have integrated expression profile analyses of both coding genes and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) to characterize the functional activity of microbial community members. Here, we defined gene expression profiles from environmental and laboratory-grown acidophilic biofilms using RNASeq. In total, 15.8 million Illumina reads were mapped to the genomes of 26 acidophilic microorganisms and nine viruses reconstructed from the Richmond Mine at Iron Mountain, California. More than 99% of the genome was transcribed in three Leptospirillum species, and > 80% in the archaea G-plasma and Ferroplasma Type II. High gene expression by G-plasma and the Leptospirillum Group II UBA strain correlated with extremely acidic conditions, whereas high transcriptional expression of Leptospirillum Group III and Leptospirillum Group II 5way-CG strain occurred under higher pH and lower temperature. While expression of CRISPR Cas genes occurs on the sense strand, expression of the CRISPR loci occurs on the antisense strand in the Leptospirilli. A novel riboswitch associated with the biosynthetic pathway for the osmolyte ectoine was upregulated when each specific Leptospirillum Group II strain was growing under the conditions most favorable for it. Newly described ncRNAs associated with CO dehydrogenase (CODH) suggest regulation of expression of CODH as a CO sensor in mature biofilms in the Leptospirilli. Results reveal the ways in which environmental conditions shape transcriptional profiles of organisms growing in acidophilic microbial communities and highlight the significance of ncRNAs in regulating gene expression.\n\nIMPORTANCEMicroorganisms play important roles in environmental acidification and in metal-recovery based bioleaching processes. Therefore, characterizing how actively growing microbial communities respond to different environments is key to understanding their role in those processes. Microorganisms express their genes, both coding and non-coding, differently depending on environmental factors, thus evaluating community expression profiles inform about the ecology of actively growing microorganisms.

    "abstract": "Whether extension of lifespan provides an extended time without health deteriorations is an important issue for human aging. However, to which degree lifespan and healthspan regulation might be linked is not well understood. Chromatin factors could be involved in linking both aging aspects, as epigenetic mechanisms bridge regulation of different biological processes. The epigenetic factor LIN-53 (RBBP4/7) is required for safeguarding cell identities in Caenorhabditis elegans as well as mammals and for preventing memory loss and premature aging in humans. LIN-53 is a histone chaperone that associates with different chromatin-regulating complexes. We show that LIN-53 interacts with the Nucleosome remodeling and deacteylase (NuRD)-complex in C. elegans muscles to promote healthy locomotion during aging. While mutants for other NuRD members show a normal lifespan, animals lacking LIN-53 die early because LIN-53 depletion affects also the Histone deacetylase complex Sin3, which is required for a normal lifespan. To determine why lin-53 and sin-3 mutants die early, we performed transcriptome and metabolome analysis and found that levels of the disaccharide Trehalose are significantly decreased in both mutants. As Trehalose is required for normal lifespan in C. elegans, lin-53 and sin-3 mutants could be rescued by either feeding with Trehalose or increasing Trehalose levels via the Insulin/IGF1 signaling pathway. Overall, our findings suggest that LIN-53 is required for maintaining lifespan and promoting healthspan through discrete chromatin regulatory mechanisms. Since both LIN-53 and its mammalian homologs safeguard cell identities, it is conceivable that its implication in lifespan and healthspan regulation is also evolutionarily conserved.",

    "abstract": "Liquid biopsies are revolutionizing the fields of prenatal non-invasive testing and cancer diagnosis by leveraging the genetic differences between mother and fetus, and, host and cancer. In the absence of genetic variance, epigenetics has been used to decipher the cell-of-origin of cell-free DNA (cfDNA). Liquid biopsies are minimally invasive and thus represent an attractive option for hard to biopsy tissues such as the brain. Here we report the first evidence of neuron derived cfDNA and cerebellum cfDNA within acute neurotrauma and chronic neurodegeneration, establishing the first class of peripheral biomarkers with specificity for the cell-type and brain-region undergoing potential injury and/or neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNeurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology in Alzheimers disease (AD) follows a stereotypic progression well-characterized by Braak staging. However, some AD cases show deviations from the Braak staging scheme. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that these variations in the regional distribution of tau pathology are linked to heterogeneity in the clinical phenotypes of AD.\n\nMethodsWe included a clinicopathological cohort of ninety-four AD cases enriched for atypical clinical presentations. Subjects underwent apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping and neuropsychological testing. Main cognitive domains (executive, visuospatial, language, and memory function) were assessed using an established composite z-score. We assessed NFT density and distribution from thioflavin S fluorescent microscopy throughout four neocortical and two hippocampal regions. A mathematical algorithm classifying AD cases into typical, hippocampal sparing (HpSp), and limbic predominant (LP) subtypes based on regional NFT burden was compared to unbiased hierarchical clustering for cases with Braak stage > IV.\n\nResultsPatients diagnosed with logopenic primary progressive aphasia showed significantly higher NFT density in the superior temporal gyrus relative to patients diagnosed with Alzheimer-type dementia (p = 0.0091), while patients with corticobasal syndrome showed significantly higher NFT density in the primary motor cortex (p = 0.0205). Hierarchical clustering identified three discrete clusters of patients characterized respectively by low overall NFT burden (n = 18), high overall burden (n = 30), and cortical-predominant burden (n = 24). A regionally specific effect was observed for visuospatial ability; higher NFT density in the angular gyrus ({beta} = - 0.0921, p = 0.0099) and in the CA1 sector of the hippocampus ({beta} = -0.0735, p = 0.0380) was significantly associated with more severe visuospatial dysfunction, modulated by age of death.\n\nConclusionsOur results suggest domain-specific functional consequences of regional NFT accumulation. In particular, we observed focal aggregation of NFT density in clinically relevant regions among different clinical AD variants. Continued work to map the regionally specific clinical consequences of tau accumulation presents an opportunity to increase understanding of disease mechanisms underlying atypical clinical manifestations.",
