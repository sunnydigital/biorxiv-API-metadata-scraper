    "abstract": "Bifunctional degrader molecules, known as proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), function by recruiting a target to an E3 ligase, forming a target:PROTAC:ligase ternary complex. Despite the importance of this key intermediate species, no detailed validation of a method to directly determine binding parameters for ternary complex kinetics has been reported, and it remains to be addressed whether tuning the kinetics of PROTAC ternary complexes may be an effective strategy to improve the efficiency of targeted protein degradation. Here, we develop an SPR-based assay to quantify the stability of PROTAC-induced ternary complexes by measuring for the first time the kinetics of their formation and dissociation in vitro using purified proteins. We benchmark our assay using four PROTACs that target the bromodomains (BDs) of BET proteins Brd2, Brd3 and Brd4 to the E3 ligase VHL. We reveal marked differences in ternary complex off-rates for different PROTACs that exhibit either positive or negative cooperativity for ternary complex formation relative to binary binding. The positively cooperative degrader MZ1 forms comparatively stable and long-lived ternary complexes with either Brd4BD2 or Brd2BD2 and VHL. Equivalent complexes with Brd3BD2 are destabilised due to a single amino acid difference (Glu/Gly swap) present in the bromodomain. We observe that this difference in ternary complex dissociative half-life correlates to a greater initial rate of intracellular degradation of Brd2 and Brd4 relative to Brd3. These findings establish a novel assay to measure the kinetics of PROTAC ternary complexes and elucidate the important kinetic parameters that drive effective target degradation.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=121 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/451948v2_ufig2.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 2\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10e7c1eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f6a57forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1eb6e46org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@194cb2a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Enhancing the efficacy of proteasome inhibitors is a central goal in myeloma therapy. We proposed that signaling-level responses after PI would reveal new mechanisms of action that could be therapeutically exploited. Unbiased phosphoproteomics after the PI carfilzomib surprisingly demonstrated the most prominent phosphorylation changes on splicing related proteins. Spliceosome modulation was invisible to RNA or protein abundance alone. Transcriptome analysis after PI demonstrated broad-scale intron retention, suggestive of spliceosome interference, as well as specific alternative splicing of protein homeostasis machinery components. These findings led us to evaluate direct spliceosome inhibition in myeloma, which synergized with carfilzomib and showed potent anti-tumor activity. Functional genomics and exome sequencing further supported the spliceosome as a specific vulnerability in myeloma. Our results propose splicing interference as an unrecognized modality of PI mechanism, reveal additional modes of spliceosome modulation, and suggest spliceosome targeting as a promising therapeutic strategy in myeloma.\n\nSignificanceNew ways to enhance PI efficacy are of major interest. We combine systems-level analyses to discover that PIs specifically interfere with splicing and that myeloma is selectively vulnerable to spliceosome inhibition. We reveal a new approach to advance myeloma therapy and uncover broader roles of splicing modulation in cancer.",

    "abstract": "The most mineralized tissue of the mammalian body is tooth enamel. Especially in species with thick enamel, three-dimensional (3D) tomography data has shown that the distribution of enamel varies across the occlusal surface of the tooth crown. Differences in enamel thickness among species and within the tooth crown have been used to examine taxonomic affiliations, life history, and functional properties of teeth. Before becoming fully mineralized, enamel matrix is secreted on the top of a dentine template, and it remains to be explored how matrix thickness is spatially regulated. To provide a predictive framework to examine enamel distribution, we introduce a computational model of enamel matrix secretion that maps the dentine topography to the enamel surface topography. Starting from empirical enamel-dentine junctions, enamel matrix deposition is modeled as a diffusion-limited free boundary problem. Using laboratory microCT and synchrotron tomographic data of pig molars that have markedly different dentine and enamel surface topographies, we show how diffusion-limited matrix deposition accounts for both the process of matrix secretion and the final enamel distribution. Simulations reveal how concave and convex dentine features have distinct effects on enamel surface, thereby explaining why the enamel surface is not a straightforward extrapolation of the dentine template. Human molar simulations show that even subtle variation in dentine topography can be mapped to the enamel surface features. Mechanistic models of extracellular matrix deposition can be used to predict occlusal morphologies of teeth.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety disorders pose one of the biggest threats to mental health worldwide, yet current therapeutics have been mostly ineffective due to issues with relapse, efficacy, and toxicit. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a promising therapy for treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders including anxiety, but very little is known about the effects of DBS on fear memories. In this study, we used a modified plus-maze discriminative and showed that DBS of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was able to disrupt consolidation, but not acquisition or retrieval of fear memories. We validated these results using a standard tone-footshock fear conditioning paradigm. We further demonstrated short-term changes in dopaminergic receptor and c-Fos expression in the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) and established a partial casual role of dopamine 2 receptors in this effect. Lastly, we showed changes in neurotransmitter levels in the vHPC. This study highlights the potential therapeutic effect of vmPFC DBS to treat anxiety disorders.",

Given that the circadian clock regulates sleep, hippocampal function, and neurodegeneration, it represents a therapeutic target against AD. Casein kinase 1{delta}/{varepsilon} (CK1{delta}/{varepsilon}) are clock regulators and overexpressed in AD brains, making them viable targets to improve sleep and cognition. We assessed the effects of a small molecule CK1{delta}/{varepsilon} inhibitor (PF-670462) in a cellular model of circadian clocks and in 3xTg-AD mice. Mass spectrometry-based proteomic analyses revealed that PF-670462 treatment in vitro upregulated multiple proteins that are downregulated in AD, while administration in 3xTg-AD mice reversed hippocampal proteomic alterations in diverse AD-associated and clock-regulated pathways, including synaptic plasticity and amyloid precursor protein processing. Furthermore, PF-670462 rescued working memory and normalized behavioural circadian rhythms in 3xTg-AD mice. Our study provides proof of concept for CK1{delta}/{varepsilon} inhibition and direct clock modulation against AD-related proteomic changes, memory impairment, and circadian disturbances.",

Here, using new tools for real-time visualization of native YAP and target gene transcription dynamics, we show that a cycle of fast exodus of nuclear YAP to the cytoplasm followed by fast reentry to the nucleus (\"localization-resets\") activates YAP target genes. These \"resets\" could be induced by calcium signaling, modulation of actomyosin contractility, or mitosis. Using nascent-transcription reporter knock-ins of YAP target genes, we observed a strict association between these resets and downstream transcription. Oncogenically-transformed transformed cell lines lacked localization-resets and instead showed dramatically elevated rates of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of YAP, suggesting an escape from compartmentalization-based control. The single-cell localization and transcription traces suggest that YAP activity is not a simple linear function of nuclear enrichment and point to a new model of transcriptional activation based on nucleocytoplasmic exchange properties of YAP.",

    "abstract": "KATP channels consist of four Kir6.x pore-forming subunits and four regulatory sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) subunits. These channels couple the metabolic state of the cell to membrane excitability and play a key role in physiological processes such as insulin secretion in the pancreas, protection of cardiac muscle during ischemia and hypoxic vasodilation of arterial smooth muscle cells. Abnormal channel function resulting from inherited gain or loss-of-function mutations in either the Kir6.x and/or SUR subunits are associated with severe diseases such as neonatal diabetes, congenital hyperinsulinism or Cantu syndrome (CS). CS is an ultra-rare genetic autosomal dominant disorder, caused by dominant gain-of-function mutations in SUR2A or Kir6.1 subunits. No specific pharmacotherapeutic treatment options are currently available for Cantu syndrome. Kir6 specific inhibitors could be beneficial for the development of novel drug therapies for Cantu syndrome, particular for mutations, which lack high affinity for sulfonylurea inhibitor glibenclamide. By applying a combination of computational methods including atomistic MD simulations, free energy calculations and pharmacophore modelling, we identified several novel Kir6.1 inhibitors, which might be possible candidates for drug repurposing. The in silico predictions were confirmed using inside/out patch-clamp analysis. Importantly, Cantu mutation C176S in Kir6.1 and S1020P in SUR2A, retained high affinity towards the novel inhibitors. Summarizing, the inhibitors identified in this study might provide a starting point towards developing novel therapies for Cantu disease.",

Our previous discovery of its extracellular hydrolase ENPP1 hinted at the existence of extracellular cGAMP. Here, using mass spectrometry, we detected that cGAMP is continuously exported as a soluble factor by an engineered cell line but then efficiently cleared by ENPP1, explaining why it has escaped detection until now. By developing a potent, specific, and cell impermeable ENPP1 inhibitor, we detected cGAMP export in cancer cell lines commonly used for mouse tumor models. In tumors, depletion of extracellular cGAMP using neutralizing proteins decreased tumor-associated dendritic cells. Boosting extracellular cGAMP by genetic knockout and pharmacological inhibition of ENPP1 increased tumor-associated dendritic cells, shrunk tumors, and synergized with ionizing radiation and anti-CTLA-4 to cure tumors. In conclusion, cGAMP is an anti-cancer immunotransmitter released by tumors and detected by host innate immunity.",

    "abstract": "The response of cells to mechanical stress is crucial for many cellular functions, yet its molecular mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Previous studies of the cellular response to mechanical stress were performed on cultured cells or isolated muscle fibers devoid of cell and/or tissue contexts. Thus, the emerging results were limited to the specific cell types or tissues analyzed and dependent on the growth matrix elasticity. In the present study, we looked for changes in early gene expression in response to mechanical whole body stretching of living C. elegans. Our transcriptome analysis revealed upregulation of genes involved in cuticle development, stress response and several signaling pathways such as WNT, TGF{beta}, AMPK and Hedgehog signaling. These findings indicate that protecting against mechanical insults entails providing additional support to the mechanically resilient protective cuticle, and that proper recovery from mechanical stretching requires an intact Hedgehog signaling pathway. Recent findings suggest an important role for the nuclear lamina in mediating cellular mechanical response. The nuclear lamina is composed mainly of lamins, which are nuclear intermediate filament-type proteins needed, among other functions to maintain nuclear integrity. One particular area of interest are laminopathies, which are caused by mutations in lamin. Stretched animals expressing the Emery Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy (EDMD) linked L535P lamin mutation, showed further upregulation of cytoskeleton organization, cellular respiration and mitochondrial protein-unfolding stress response genes, most likely to compensate for aberrant muscle tissue function. These findings provide a broad multi-dimensional picture of the in vivo genetic response of live animals to mechanical stress, highlighting previously unreported mechano-sensitive genes and molecular pathways.",

    "abstract": "High temperature requirement factor A1 (HtrA1) is a serine protease of the mammalian HtrA family. It is ubiquitously expressed with high levels in the placenta. Dysregulation of HtrA1 has been linked to a number of diseases, in particular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and preeclampsia (PE) in which HtrA1 is significantly increased. AMD is the leading cause of irreversible visual impairment in older people, affecting millions across the globe. PE is a life-threatening pregnancy complication, affecting 2-7% of pregnant women worldwide. Although AMD and PE are very different diseases, both are associated with endothelial dysfunction and dysregulation of angiogenesis. Given HtrA1 is up-regulated in both AMD and PE, in this study we examined the impact of excessive HtrA1 on capillary tube formation of HUVECs as an in vitro angiogenesis model. HtrA1 at high concentrations significantly increased the total number of tube branch points and inter-tubular loops, but considerably decreased the mean tube length, resulting in more but much smaller tubes. However, these smaller tubes were incomplete/broken. These data demonstrated that high concentrations of HtrA1 altered endothelial tube formation characteristics of HUVEVs. Our results suggest that HtrA1 over-expression in AMD and PE may directly contribute to the endothelial dysfunction in these diseases.",

Both factors, host immunity and transmission environment, play important part in evolution and selection.\n\nConventional population-based models of malaria have limited capacity to accommodate parasite-immune dynamics within-host and strain diversity. Here we developed an in-host model for multi-strain malaria based on its genetic (immunogenic) makeup, which accounts for essential parasite-immune biology. The model allows efficient simulations of mixed-strain infections in individual hosts and in host ensembles over multiple transmission cycles. We use it to explore evolutionary implications (competition, selection) of malaria quasi-species, driven by host immunity and transmission intensity.\n\nResultsThe key  selectable trait within-host is strain transmissibility (TP), which measures cumulative odds of mosquito infection by a given strain over infection history. Here we adopt it to explore evolutionary implications of parasite-immune interactions on different time scales and transmission environments. Specifically, we explore (i) primary strain selection in naive host ensembles based on TP-fitness; (ii) evolution and selection of mixed multi-strain systems over multiple transmission cycles.\n\nOn level (i) different strain mixtures competed in multiple hosts, to identify  most fit (highly transmissible) types. A key observation of (i) was fitness-cost of in-host competition, i.e. statistical TP-loss determined by multiplicity of infection (number of competing strains), and strain genotype (immunogenic profile). The most-fit strains maintained their high TP-values regardless of competing environment.\n\nWe selected them for step (ii), to explore long-term evolution over multiple transmission cycles. Our analysis revealed peculiar features of evolution: success within-host (step (i)) did not guarantee strain survival over multiple cycles. Indeed, the latter was strongly associated with cooperative behavior, i.e. co-existence of a given strain in suitable mixtures, in multiple hosts over many generations. We examined the resulting population structure of evolving strains, in terms of their immune cross-reactivity. Overall, our results were consistent with predictions of strain theory [1-4], [5, 6]. Strain theory predicts that cross-reacting parasite strains in host population should organize themselves into  non-overlapping (immunogenically disjunct) clusters. In our case, no strict  immune separation arises, but cross-reactivity is lost over multiple cycles, and surviving clusters are  nearly disjunct. Such weakly overlapping clusters (cooperating cliques) persisted over long (evolutionary) periods. Specifically, each clique was found to possess a core node -highly cooperative persistent strain, carrying a subordinate (transient) cluster.\n\nOur results shed new light on relative importance of competitive vs. cooperative behavior, and multi-level organization of genetically structured parasite system. They could have implications for malaria control and vaccine design.",

    "abstract": "Events and objects in the world must be inferred from sensory signals to support behavior. Because sensory measurements are temporally and spatially local, the estimation of an object or event can be viewed as the grouping of these measurements into representations of their common causes. Per-ceptual grouping is believed to reflect internalized regularities of the natural environment, yet grouping cues have traditionally been identified using informal observation, and investigated using artificial stim-uli. The relationship of grouping to natural signal statistics has thus remained unclear, and additional or alternative cues remain possible. Here we derive auditory grouping cues by measuring and summarizing statistics of natural sound features. Feature co-occurrence statistics reproduced established cues but also revealed previously unappreciated grouping principles. The results suggest that auditory grouping is adapted to natural stimulus statistics, show how these statistics can reveal novel grouping phenomena, and provide a framework for studying grouping in natural signals.",

    "abstract": "Field-grown plants have variable exposure to sunlight as a result of shifting cloud-cover, seasonal changes, canopy shading, and other environmental factors. As a result, they need to have developed a method for dissipating excess energy obtained from periodic excessive sunlight exposure. Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) dissipates excess energy as heat, however the physical and molecular genetic mechanics of NPQ variation are not understood. In this study, we investigated the genetic loci involved in NPQ by first growing different Arabidopsis thaliana accessions in local and seasonal climate conditions, then measured their NPQ kinetics through development by chlorophyll fluorescence. We used genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify 15 significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) for a range of photosynthetic traits, including a QTL co-located with known NPQ gene PSBS (AT1G44575). We found there were large alternative regulatory segments between the PSBS promoter regions of the functional haplotypes and a significant difference in PsbS protein concentration. These findings parallel studies in rice showing recurrent regulatory evolution of this gene. The variation in the PSBS promoter and the changes underlying other QTLs could give insight to allow manipulations of NPQ in crops to improve their photosynthetic efficiency and yield.\n\nB.P. & J.B. conceived the project; B.P., J.B., P.W. and T.R. designed the research plan and analysis; P.W. supervised the experiments; T.R. performed most of the experiments and analysis; P.G., T.S., A.A. & E.A. designed and undertook experimental design, experiments and analysis for Figure 4; R.C. did the GWAS analysis; P.W., T.R. & A.A. wrote the article with contributions of all the authors.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=158 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/539379v1_fig4.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 4\">\nView larger version (57K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12ba2f9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d88c15org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d4f21eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16396aa_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 4:C_FLOATNO (A-D) Coverage tracks of the PSBS genomic regions from five low NPQ (A and B) and five high NPQ (C and D) Arabidopsis accessions aligned with the TAIR 10 Col-0 reference genome (low NPQ accession; A and C) and KBS-Mac-74 genome (high NPQ accession; B and D).

Here, we consider transcriptional data to segment the patient population into subsets relevant to a given phenotype. Whereas most existing patient stratification methods focus either on predictive performance or interpretable features, we developed a method striking a balance between these two important goals. We introduce a Bayesian method called SUBSTRA that uses regularized biclustering to identify patient subtypes and interpretable subtype-specific transcript clusters. The method iteratively re-weights feature importance to optimize phenotype prediction performance by producing more phenotype-relevant patient subtypes. We investigate the performance of SUBSTRA in finding relevant features using simulated data and successfully benchmark it against state-of-the-art unsupervised stratification methods and supervised alternatives. Moreover, SUBSTRA achieves predictive performance competitive with supervised benchmark methods and provides interpretable transcriptional features in diverse biological settings, such as drug response prediction, cancer diagnosis, or kidney transplant rejection.",

    "abstract": "Cholesterol is a critical component of membranes and a precursor for hormones and other signaling molecules. Previously, we showed that unlike astrocytes, glioblastoma cells do not downregulate cholesterol synthesis when plated at high density. In this report, we show that high cell density induces ABCA1 expression in glioblastoma cells, enabling them to get rid of excess cholesterol generated by an activated cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Because oxysterols are agonists for Liver X Receptors (LXRs), we investigated whether increased cholesterol activates LXRs to maintain cholesterol homeostasis in highly-dense glioblastoma cells. We observed that dense cells had increased oxysterols, which activated LXR{beta} to upregulate ABCA1. Cells with CRISPR-mediated knockdown of LXR{beta}, but not ABCA1, had decreased cell cycle progression and cell survival, and decreased feedback repression of the mevalonate pathway in densely-plated glioma cells. LXR{beta} gene expression poorly correlates with ABCA1 in glioblastoma patients, and expression of each gene correlates with poor patient prognosis in different prognostic subtypes. Finally, gene expression and lipidomics analyses of crLXR{beta} cells revealed that LXR{beta} regulates the expression of immune response gene sets and lipids known to be involved in immune modulation. Thus, therapeutic targeting of LXR{beta} in glioblastoma might be effective through diverse mechanisms.",

However, how traits and their plasticity in response to contrasting environments connect with the mechanisms determining species coexistence remains poorly understood. Here, we coupled field experiments under two contrasted climatic conditions to a plant population model describing competitive dynamics between 10 annual plant species in order to evaluate the associations of niche and fitness differences with 19 functional traits covering physiological, morphological and reproductive characteristics. We found a rich diversity of univariate and multidimensional relationships, in which outstand the primary role of traits related to water- and light-use-efficiency in modulating the determinants of competitive outcomes. Importantly, such traits and their plasticity promoted species coexistence across climatic conditions by enhancing stabilizing niche differences and by generating competitive trade-offs between species. Our study represents a significant advance showing how leading dimensions of plant form and function connect to the mechanisms determining the maintenance of biodiversity.",

As mutation rates are tightly and negatively correlated with genome size, selection is a clear driver of viral evolution. However, the role of intragenomic interactions as drivers of viral evolution is less well documented. To understand how these two processes affect viral evolution, we systematically surveyed ssRNA, ssDNA, dsRNA, and dsDNA viruses, to find which virus type and which functions show evidence for episodic diversifying selection and correlated evolution. We show that while evidence for selection is mostly found in single stranded viruses, and correlated evolution is more prevalent in DNA viruses, the genes that are affected by both processes are involved in key aspects of their life cycle, favoring viral stability over proliferation. We further show that both evolutionary processes are intimately linked at the amino acid level, which suggests that selection alone does not explain the whole evolutionary --and epidemiological-- potential of viruses.",

Lack of recombination limits breeding efforts in crops, therefore increasing recombination rates can reduce linkage-drag and generate new genetic combinations. We use computational analysis of 13 recombinant inbred mapping populations to assess crossover and gene conversion frequency in the hexaploid genome of wheat (Triticum aestivum). We observe that high frequency crossover sites are shared between populations and that closely related parental founders lead to populations with more similar crossover patterns. We demonstrate that gene conversion is more prevalent and covers more of the genome in wheat than in other plants, making it a critical process in the generation of new haplotypes, particularly in centromeric regions where crossovers are rare. We have identified QTL for altered gene conversion and crossover frequency and confirm functionality for a novel RecQ helicase gene that belongs to an ancient clade that is missing in some plant lineages including Arabidopsis. This is the first gene to be demonstrated to be involved in gene conversion in wheat. Harnessing the RecQ helicase has the potential to break linkage-drag utilizing widespread gene conversions.",

    "abstract": "Cellular heterogeneity in gene expression is driven by cellular processes such as cell cycle and cell-type identity, and cellular environment such as spatial location. The cell cycle, in particular, is thought to be a key driver of cell-to-cell heterogeneity in gene expression, even in otherwise homogeneous cell populations. Recent advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) facilitate detailed characterization of gene expression heterogeneity, and can thus shed new light on the processes driving heterogeneity. Here, we combined fluorescence imaging with scRNA-seq to measure cell cycle phase and gene expression levels in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Using these data, we developed a novel approach to characterize cell cycle progression. While standard methods assign cells to discrete cell cycle stages, our method goes beyond this, and quantifies cell cycle progression on a continuum. We found that, on average, scRNA-seq data from only five genes predicted a cells position on the cell cycle continuum to within 14% of the entire cycle, and that using more genes did not improve this accuracy. Our data and predictor of cell cycle phase can directly help future studies to account for cell-cycle-related heterogeneity in iPSCs. Our results and methods also provide a foundation for future work to characterize the effects of the cell cycle on expression heterogeneity in other cell types.",

The Nipped-B protein loads cohesin topologically around chromosomes to mediate sister chromatid cohesion and facilitate long-range control of gene transcription. It is largely unknown how Nipped-B and cohesin associate specifically with gene promoters and transcriptional enhancers, or how sister chromatid cohesion is established. Here we use genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation in Drosophila cells to show that SA and the Fs(1)h (BRD4) BET domain protein help recruit Nipped-B and cohesin to enhancers and DNA replication origins, while the MED30 subunit of the Mediator complex directs Nipped-B and Rad21 to promoters. All enhancers and their neighboring promoters are close to DNA replication origins and bind SA with proportional levels of cohesin subunits. Most promoters are far from origins and lack SA, but bind Nipped-B and Rad21 with sub-proportional amounts of Smc1, indicating that they bind SA-deficient cohesin part of the time. Genetic data confirm that Nipped-B and Rad21 function together with Fs(1)h in vivo to facilitate Drosophila development. These findings demonstrate that Nipped-B and cohesin are differentially targeted to enhancers and promoters and suggest models for how SA and DNA replication help establish sister chromatid cohesion and facilitate enhancer-promoter communication. They indicate that SA is not an obligatory cohesin subunit but a factor that controls cohesin location on chromosomes.",

    "abstract": "Mobilized colistin resistance (mcr) genes are plasmid-borne genes that confer resistance to colistin, an antibiotic used to treat severe bacterial infections. To date, eight known mcr homologues have been described (mcr-1 to -8). Here, we describe mcr-9, a novel mcr homologue, detected in a Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) genome using an in silico approach, followed by experimental functional analysis. The amino acid sequence of mcr-9, detected in a multidrug resistant (MDR) S. Typhimurium strain isolated from a human patient in Washington State in 2010, most closely resembled mcr-3, aligning with 64.5% amino acid identity and 99.5% coverage using translated nucleotide blast. The S. Typhimurium strain was tested for phenotypic resistance to colistin and was found to be sensitive at the 2 mg/L European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing breakpoint under the tested conditions. To determine whether it was capable of conferring resistance to colistin when expressed in a heterologous host, mcr-9 was cloned in colistin-susceptible Escherichia coli NEB5 under an IPTG-induced promoter. Expression of mcr-9 conferred resistance to colistin in E. coli NEB5 at 1, 2, and 2.5 mg/L colistin, albeit at a lower level when compared to mcr-3. Pairwise comparisons of the predicted protein structures associated with all nine mcr homologues (Mcr-1 to -9) revealed that Mcr-9, Mcr-3, and Mcr-7 share a high degree of similarity at the structural level. The results of our approach indicate that mcr-9 is capable of conferring phenotypic resistance to colistin in Enterobacteriaceae and should be immediately considered when monitoring plasmid-mediated colistin resistance. Importance: Colistin is a last-resort antibiotic that is used to treat severe infections caused by MDR and extensively drug resistant (XDR) bacteria. The World Health Organization (WHO) has designated colistin as a Highest Priority Critically Important Antimicrobial for human medicine (WHO, Critically Important Antimicrobials for Human Medicine, 5th Revision, 2017), as it is often one of the only therapies available for treating serious bacterial infections in critically ill patients. Plasmid-borne mcr genes that confer resistance to colistin pose a threat to public health at an international scale, as they can be transmitted via horizontal gene transfer and have the potential to spread globally. Therefore, the establishment of a complete reference of mcr genes that can be used to screen for plasmid-mediated colistin resistance is essential for developing effective control strategies.",

    "abstract": "Salmonella enterica serotype Kentucky (S. Kentucky) can be a common causative agent of salmonellosis, usually associated with consumption of contaminated poultry. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to multiple drugs, including ciprofloxacin, is an emerging problem within this serotype. We used whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to investigate the phylogenetic structure and AMR content of 121 S. Kentucky ST198 isolates from five continents. Population structure was inferred using phylogenomic analysis and whole genomes were compared to investigate changes in gene content, with a focus on acquired AMR genes. Our analysis showed that multidrug resistant (MDR) S. Kentucky isolates belonged to a single lineage, which we estimate emerged circa 1989 following the acquisition of the AMR-associated Salmonella genomic island 1 (variant SGI1-K) conferring resistance ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline. Phylogeographic analysis indicates this clone emerged in Egypt before disseminating into Northern, Southern and Western Africa, then to the Middle East, Asia and the European Union. The MDR clone has since accumulated various substitution mutations in the quinolone resistance determining regions (QRDR) of DNA gyrase (gyrA) and DNA topoisomerase (parC), such that most strains carry three QRDR mutations which together confer resistance to ciprofloxacin. The majority of AMR genes in the S. Kentucky genomes were carried either on plasmids or SGI structures. Remarkably, each genome carried a different SGI1-K derivative structure; this variation could be attributed to IS26-mediated insertions and deletions, which appear to have hampered previous attempts to trace the clone's evolution using sub-WGS resolution approaches. Several different AMR plasmids were also identified, encoding resistance to chloramphenicol, third-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, and/or azithromycin. These results indicate that most MDR S. Kentucky circulating globally result from the clonal expansion of a single lineage that acquired chromosomal AMR genes 30 years ago, and has continued to diversify and accumulate additional resistances to last-line oral antimicrobials.",

    "abstract": "Microsaccades are overwhelmingly described as involuntary eye movements. Here we show in both human subjects and monkeys that individual microsaccades of any direction can easily be triggered: (1) \"on demand\", based on an arbitrary instruction, (2) without any special training, (3) without visual guidance by a stimulus, and (4) in a spatially and temporally accurate manner. Subjects voluntarily generated instructed \"memory-guided\" microsaccades readily, and similarly to how they made normal visually-guided ones. In two monkeys, we also observed midbrain superior colliculus neurons that exhibited movement-related activity bursts exclusively for memory-guided microsaccades, but not for similarly-sized visually-guided movements. Our results demonstrate behavioral and neural evidence for voluntary control over individual microsaccades, supporting recently discovered functional contributions of individual microsaccade generation to visual performance alterations and covert visual selection.",

    "abstract": "Vision is obtained with a continuous motion of the eyes. The kinematic analysis of eye motion, during any visual or ocular task, typically reveals two (kinematic) components: saccades, which quickly replace the visual content in the retinal fovea, and drifts, which slowly scan the image after each saccade. While the saccadic exchange of regions of interest (ROIs) is commonly considered to be included in motor-sensory closed-loops, it is commonly assumed that drifts function in an open-loop manner, that is, independent of the concurrent visual input. Accordingly, visual perception is assumed to be based on a sequence of open-loop processes, each initiated by a saccade-triggered retinal snapshot. Here we directly challenged this assumption by testing the dependency of drift kinematics on concurrent visual inputs using real-time gaze-contingent-display. Our results demonstrate a dependency of the trajectory on the concurrent visual input, convergence of speed to condition-specific values and maintenance of selected drift-related motor-sensory controlled variables, all strongly indicative of drifts being included in a closed-loop brain-world process, and thus suggesting that vision is inherently a closed-loop process.\n\nAuthor summaryOur eyes do not function like cameras; it has long been known that we are actively scanning our visual environment in order to see. Moreover, it is commonly accepted that our fast eye movements, saccades, are controlled by the brain and are affected by the sensory input. However, our slow eye movements, the ocular drifts, are often ignored when visual acquisition is analyzed. Accordingly, visual processing is typically assumed to be based on computations performed on saccade-triggered snapshots of the retinal state. Our work strongly challenges this model and provides significant evidence for an alternative model, a cybernetic one. We show that the dynamics of the ocular drifts do not allow, and cannot be explained by, open loop visual acquisition. Instead, our results suggest that visual acquisition is part of a closed-loop process, which dynamically and continuously links the brain to its environment.",

    "abstract": "Eye-tracking experiments rely heavily on good data quality of eye-trackers. Unfortunately, it is often that only the spatial accuracy and precision values are available from the manufacturers. These two values alone are not sufficient enough to serve as a benchmark for an eye-tracker: Eye-tracking quality deteriorates during an experimental session due to head movements, changing illumination or calibration decay. Additionally, different experimental paradigms require the analysis of different types of eye movements, for instance smooth pursuit movements, blinks or microsaccades, which themselves cannot readily be evaluated by using spatial accuracy or precision alone. To obtain a more comprehensive description of properties, we developed an extensive eye-tracking test battery. In 10 different tasks, we evaluated eye-tracking related measures such as: the decay of accuracy, fixation durations, pupil dilation, smooth pursuit movement, microsaccade detection, blink detection, or the influence of head motion. For some measures, true theoretical values exist. For others, a relative comparison to a gold standard eye-tracker is needed. Therefore, we collected our gaze data simultaneously from a gold standard remote EyeLink 1000 eye-tracker and compared it with the mobile Pupil Labs glasses.\n\nAs expected, the average spatial accuracy of 0.57{degrees} for the EyeLink 1000 eye-tracker was better than the 0.82{degrees} for the Pupil Labs glasses (N=15). Furthermore, we detected less fixations and shorter saccade durations for the Pupil Labs glasses. Similarly, we found fewer microsaccades using the Pupil Labs glasses. The accuracy over time decayed only slightly for the EyeLink 1000, but strongly for the Pupil Labs glasses. Finally we observed that the measured pupil diameters differed between eye-trackers on the individual subject level but not the group level.\n\nTo conclude, our eye-tracking test battery offers 10 tasks that allow us to benchmark the many parameters of interest in stereotypical eye-tracking situations, or addresses a common source of confounds in measurement errors (e.g. yaw and roll head movements).\n\nAll recorded eye-tracking data (including Pupil Labs eye video files), the stimulus code for the test battery and the modular analysis pipeline are available (https://github.com/behinger/etcomp).\n\nBVE, KG, II and PK conceived the experiment. II and BVE created the experiment and recorded the gaze data. BVE and KG performed the analysis. BVE, KG and PK reviewed the manuscript critically.",

    "abstract": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an intractable interstitial lung disease for which no curative treatment is available except for lung transplantation. Its pathogenesis is unclear, but a role for injury to type 2 alveolar epithelial cells is hypothesized. Recessive mutations in some, but not all genes implicated in Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS) cause HPS-associated interstitial pneumonia (HPSIP), a clinical entity similar to IPF. We previously reported that mutation in HPS1 in embryonic stem cells-derived 3D lung organoids caused fibrotic changes. Here we show that introduction of all HPS mutations associated with HPSIP (HPS1, 2 and 4) promote fibrosis in lung organoids, while mutation in HSP8, which is not associated with HPSIP, does not. Furthermore, genome-expression analysis of epithelial cells derived from these organoids revealed significant overlap with similar analyses of both affected and unaffected lung tissue of non-HPS IPF patients. Importantly, this analysis showed upregulation of interleukin-11 in HPS-mutant fibrotic organoids and in fibrotic and unaffected lung tissue from IPF patients. Furthermore, IL-11 induced fibrosis in WT organoids, while its deletion prevented fibrosis in fibrotic HPS4-mutant organoids, suggesting IL-11 as a therapeutic target in IPF and HPSIP. hPSC-derived 3D lung organoids are therefore a valuable resource to model fibrotic lung disease.",

The mechanism by which the integrity of the GFA is compromised and manifest in proteinuria during ischemic stroke remains enigmatic. Hypoxia is a determining factor in the pathophysiology of ischemia. We investigated the mechanism of ischemic-hypoxia induced proteinuria in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. Ischemic hypoxia resulted in the accumulation of HIF1 in the glomerular podocytes that resulted in the increased expression of ZEB2. ZEB2, in turn, induced TRPC6 (transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily C, member 6), which has increased selectivity for calcium. Elevated expression of TRPC6 elicited increased calcium influx and aberrant activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in podocytes. FAK activation resulted in the stress fibers reorganization and podocyte foot process effacement. Our study suggests overactive HIF1/ZEB2 axis during ischemic-hypoxia induces intracellular calcium levels via TRPC6 and consequently altered podocyte integrity and permselectivity.",

    "abstract": "For decades, codon usage has been used as a measure of adaptation for translational efficiency and translation accuracy of a genes coding sequence. These patterns of codon usage reflect both the selective and mutational environment in which the coding sequences evolved. Over this same period, gene transfer between lineages has become widely recognized as an important biological phenomenon. Nevertheless, most studies of codon usage implicitly assume that all genes within a genome evolved under the same selective and mutational environment, an assumption violated when introgression occurs. In order to better understand the effects of introgression on codon usage patterns and vice versa, we examine the patterns of codon usage in Lachancea kluyveri, a yeast which has experienced a large introgression. We quantify the effects of mutation bias and selection for translation efficiency on the codon usage pattern of the endogenous and introgressed exogenous genes using a Bayesian mixture model, ROC SEMPPR, which is built on mechanistic assumptions about protein synthesis and grounded in population genetics.\n\nWe find substantial differences in codon usage between the endogenous and exogenous genes, and show that these differences can be largely attributed to differences in mutation bias favoring A/T ending codons in the endogenous genes while favoring C/G ending codons in the exogenous genes. Recognizing the two different signatures of mutation bias and selection improves our ability to predict protein synthesis rate by 42% and allowed us to accurately assess the decaying signal of endogenous codon mutation and preferences. In addition, using our estimates of mutation bias and selection, we identify Eremothecium gossypii as the closest relative to the exogenous genes, providing an alternative hypothesis about the origin of the exogenous genes, estimate that the introgression occurred [~] 6 x 108 generation ago, and estimate its historic and current selection against mismatched codon usage.\n\nOur work illustrates how mechanistic, population genetic models like ROC SEMPPR can separate the effects of mutation and selection on codon usage and provide quantitative estimates from sequence data.",

    "abstract": "Obesity and depression are major public health concerns that are both associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. There is a considerable body of literature linking obesity to the development of depression. Recent studies using Mendelian Randomization indicate that this relationship is causal. Most studies of the obesity-depression association have used body mass index as a measure of obesity. Body mass index is defined as weight (measured in kilograms) divided by the square of height (meters) and therefore does not distinguish between the contributions of fat and non-fat to body weight. To better understand the obesity-depression association, we conduct a Mendelian Randomization study of the relationship between fat mass, non-fat mass, height, and depression, using genome-wide association study results from the UK Biobank (n=332,000) and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (n=480,000). Our findings suggest that both fat mass and height (short stature) are causal risk factors for depression, while non-fat mass is not. These results represent important new knowledge on the role of anthropometric measures in the etiology of depression. They also suggest that reducing fat mass will decrease the risk of depression, which lends further support to public health measures aimed at reducing the obesity epidemic.",

However, in brain imaging (e.g. fMRI), the direct application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to decoding subject states or perception from imaging data seems impractical given the scarcity of available data.\n\nNew methodIn this work we propose a robust method to transfer information from deep learning (DL) features to brain fMRI data with the goal of decoding. By adopting Reduced Rank Regression with Ridge Regularisation we establish a multivariate link between imaging data and the fully connected layer (fc7) of a CNN. We exploit the reconstructed fc7 features by performing an object image classification task on two datasets: one of the largest fMRI databases, taken from different scanners from more than two hundred subjects watching different movie clips, and another with fMRI data taken while watching static images,\n\nResultsThe fc7 features could be significantly reconstructed from the imaging data, and led to significant decoding performance.\n\nComparison with existing methodsThe decoding based on reconstructed fc7 outperformed the decoding based on imaging data alone.\n\nConclusionIn this work we show how to improve fMRI-based decoding benefiting from the mapping between functional data and CNN features. The potential advantage of the proposed method is twofold: the extraction of stimuli representations by means of an automatic procedure (unsupervised) and the embedding of high-dimensional neuroimaging data onto a space designed for visual object discrimination, leading to a more manageable space from dimensionality point of view.",

    "abstract": "A defining feature of sleep is reduced responsiveness to external stimuli, but the mechanisms gating sensory-evoked arousal remain unclear. We hypothesized that reduced locus-coeruleus norepinephrine (LC-NE) activity during sleep mediates unresponsiveness, and its action promotes sensory-evoked awakenings. We tested this using electrophysiological, behavioral, pharmacological, and optogenetic techniques alongside auditory stimulation in freely behaving rats. We found that systemic reduction of NE signaling lowered probability of sound-evoked awakenings (SEAs). The level of tonic LC activity during sleep anticipated SEAs. Optogenetic LC activation promoted arousal as evident in sleep-wake transitions, EEG desynchronization, and pupil dilation. Importantly, liminal LC excitation before sound presentation increased SEA probability. Optogenetic LC silencing using a soma-targeted anion-conducting channelrhodopsin (stGtACR2) suppressed LC spiking and constricted pupils. Brief periods of LC opto-silencing reduced the probability of SEAs. Thus, LC-NE activity determines the likelihood of sensory-evoked awakenings and its reduction during sleep constitutes a key factor mediating behavioral unresponsiveness.",

    "abstract": "The high-throughput sequencing technology has yielded reliable and ultra-fast sequencing for DNA and RNA. For tumor cells of cancer patients, when combining the results of DNA and RNA sequencing, one can identify potential neoantigens that stimulate immune response of the T cells. However, when the somatic mutations are abundant, it is computationally challenging to efficiently prioritize the identified neoantigen candidates according to their ability of activating the T cell immuno-response. Numerous prioritization or prediction approaches have been proposed to address this issue but none of them considers the original DNA loci of the neoantigens from the perspective of 3D genome. Here we retrospect the DNA origins of the immune-positive and non-negative neoantigens in the context of 3D genome and discovered that 1) DNA loci of the immuno-positive neoantigens tend to cluster genome-wise. 2) DNA loci of the immuno-positive neoantigens tend to belong to active chromosomal compartment (compartment A) in some chromosomes. 3). DNA loci of the immuno-positive neoantigens tend to locate at specific regions in the 3D genome. We believe that the 3D genome information will help more precise neoantigen prioritization and discovery and eventually benefit precision and personalized medicine in cancer immunotherapy.",

We investigated the effects of dihydrotestosterone, a potent androgen, on neurogenesis in adult and middle-aged males and females. Rats were gonadectomized and injected with the DNA synthesis marker, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). The following day rats began receiving daily injections of oil or DHT for 30 days. We evaluated cell proliferation (Ki67) and new neuron survival (BrdU and BrdU/NeuN) in the hippocampus of male and female rats using immunohistochemistry. As expected, DHT increased new neuron survival in young males but surprisingly not in middle-aged male rats. In females, DHT did not significantly affect adult neurogenesis in young or middle age. Our results indicate that DHT regulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis in a sex- and age-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "MotivationDespite the existing classification- and inference-based machine learning methods that show promising results in drug-target prediction, these methods possess inevitable limitations, where: 1) results are often biased as it lacks negative samples in the classification-based methods, and 2) novel drug-target associations with new (or isolated) drugs/targets cannot be explored by inference-based methods. As big data continues to boom, there is a need to study a scalable, robust, and accurate solution that can process large heterogeneous datasets and yield valuable predictions.\n\nResultsWe introduce a drug-target prediction method that improved our previously proposed method from the three aspects: 1) we constructed a heterogeneous network which incorporates 12 repositories and includes 7 types of biomedical entities (#20,119 entities, # 194,296 associations), 2) we enhanced the feature learning method with Node2Vec, a scalable state-of-art feature learning method, 3) we integrate the originally proposed inference-based model with a classification model, which is further fine-tuned by a negative sample selection algorithm. The proposed method shows a better result for drug-target association prediction: 95.3% AUC ROC score compared to the existing methods in the 10-fold cross-validation tests. We studied the biased learning/testing in the network-based pairwise prediction, and conclude a best training strategy. Finally, we conducted a disease specific prediction task based on 20 diseases. New drug-target associations were successfully predicted with AUC ROC in average, 97.2% (validated based on the DrugBank 5.1.0). The experiments showed the reliability of the proposed method in predicting novel drug-target associations for the disease treatment.",

    "abstract": "The visual cortex of early blind individuals is reorganized to support cognitive functions distinct from vision. Research suggests that one such prominent function is language. However, it is unknown whether the visual cortex of blind individuals codes for word meaning. We addressed this question by comparing neuronal activity evoked by a semantic decision task, using magnetoencephalography (MEG), between 12 early blind and 14 sighted participants otherwise comparable with regard to gender, age and education. We found that average brain responses to thousands of auditory word stimuli followed similar time courses in blind and sighted participants. However, in blind participants only, we found a sustained enhancement of activity in the visual cortex. Moreover, across the whole brain, we found an effect of semantic category from about 400 ms after word onset. Strikingly, in blind participants, semantic categories were discriminable starting 580 ms after word onset from signal captured by sensors sensitive to the visual cortex. We replicated the analyses in time windows locked to stimulus onset and behavioral response, using both classical hypothesis testing and machine learning for single-trial classification. Semantic decisions were well classified in all participants (AUC [~] 0.60), but generalization capacity across participants was found reduced in the blind group due to a larger variability of discriminative patterns. In conclusion, our findings suggest that brain plasticity reorganizes the semantic system of blind individuals, and extends semantic computation into the visual cortex.",

    "abstract": "Introgressive hybridization results in the transfer of genetic material between species, often with fitness implications for the recipient species. The development of statistical methods for detecting the signatures of historical introgression (IG) in whole-genome data has been a major area of focus. While existing techniques are able to identify the taxa that exchanged genes during IG using a four-taxon system, most methods do not explicitly distinguish which taxon served as donor and which as recipient during IG (i.e. polarization of IG directionality). The existing methods that do polarize IG are only able to do so when there is a fifth taxon available and that taxon is sister to one of the taxa involved in IG. Here, we present Divergence-based Introgression Polarization (DIP), a method for polarizing IG using patterns of sequence divergence across whole genomes, which operates in a four-taxon context. Thus, DIP can be applied to infer the directionality of IG when additional taxa are not available. We use simulations to show that DIP can polarize IG and identify potential sources of bias in the assignment of directionality, and we apply DIP to a well-described hominin IG event.",

    "abstract": "The use and misuse of antibiotics in humans, animals and agriculture since penicillins mass production in 1942 has contributed to the current global crisis of drug-resistant infections. Often overlooked are the unintended consequences of such widespread antibiotic use, such as the chronic environmental release of unmetabolised, bioactive antibiotics and antibiotic-resistance genes found in human and animals waste, particularly during and immediately after antibiotic treatment. Here, we report on the potential impact on antibiotic resistance gene selection in rivers from the antibiotic prescribing practice of the National Health Service (NHS) of England. Macrolide and fluoroquinolone prescription data from 2015/16 were used to model the concentrations of antibiotics in a highly populous, sewage-impacted English catchment. Predicted antibiotic concentrations in the river were compared against predicted no-effect concentrations (PNEC) to assess the hazard of antibiotic resistance selection. The study revealed that PNECs for macrolides and fluoroquinolones were exceeded in 63% and 73% of the length of the modelled River Thames catchment, respectively. Potential reductions in macrolide and fluoroquinolone prescriptions (e.g., 4% and 20%) were not shown to translate into meaningful reductions in the hazard of AMR selection in the river. Reductions in macrolide and fluoroquinolone prescribing of 77% and 85%, respectively, were necessary to alleviate the AMR selection hazard from 90+% of the modelled river catchment. Improved antibiotic stewardship, alone, is unlikely to alleviate the identified challenge. Action is needed to substantially reduce antibiotic prescribing, stimulate and implement innovation in sewage-treatment, reduce non-antibiotic drivers of antibiotic resistance (e.g., biocides, metals), and consider regulating antibiotic-resistance DNA as a pollutant.",

    "abstract": "Hearing loss has been implicated as a risk factor for schizophrenia, but it is not known whether this association arises from common etiology, top-down influences (e.g., social isolation), bottom-up neurobiological mechanisms, or combinations of these factors. Patients with 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11.2DS) have a 25-30% risk of developing schizophrenia, and also suffer frequent hearing loss. Here, we used the Df1/+ mouse model of 22q11.2DS to investigate the relationship between hearing loss and susceptibility to schizophrenia-relevant brain and behavioral abnormalities. Df1/+ mice have a multi-gene deletion analogous to the chromosomal microdeletion that causes human 22q11.2DS, and like human 22q11.2DS patients exhibit high rates of hearing loss arising primarily from susceptibility to middle ear inflammation. We found that hearing loss in Df1/+ mice affected schizophrenia-relevant endophenotypes, including electrophysiological measures of central auditory gain and behavioral measures of auditory sensorimotor gating. Moreover, PV+ inhibitory interneurons, another marker for schizophrenia pathology, were significantly reduced in density in auditory cortex but not secondary motor cortex of Df1/+ mice with hearing loss. These results reveal bottom-up neurobiological mechanisms through which peripheral hearing loss arising from the 22q11.2 deletion may promote the emergence of schizophrenia-relevant auditory brain and behavioral abnormalities, and also suggest a link between conductive hearing loss and reduced PV+ interneuron density in the auditory cortex.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTHearing loss is a known risk factor for schizophrenia. Deletion of chromosomal locus 22q11.2 is associated with both schizophrenia and hearing loss in humans. In the Df1/+ mouse model of human 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome, we find that hearing loss shapes measures that are considered schizophrenia-relevant endophenotypes, such as central auditory gain and auditory sensorimotor gating. Moreover, we report a reduction in density of PV+ inhibitory interneurons in the auditory cortex, but not secondary motor cortex, of Df1/+ mice with hearing loss. These results suggest mechanisms through which hearing loss associated with the 22q11.2 deletion may promote emergence of schizophrenia-relevant auditory brain and behavioral abnormalities and indicate that conductive hearing loss may influence PV+ interneuron density in the auditory cortex.",

The superior temporal asymmetrical pit (STAP), which is not observed in chimpanzees, represents an ideal phenotype to investigate the genetic variations that support human communication. The left STAP depth was significantly associated with a predicted enhancer annotation located in the 14q23.1 locus, between DACT1 and KIAA0586, in the UK Biobank British discovery sample (N=16,515). This association was replicated in the IMAGEN cohort (N=1,726) and the UK Biobank non-British validation sample (N=2,161). This genomic region was also associated to a lesser extent with the right STAP depth and the formation of sulcal interruptions, plis de passage, in the bilateral STAP but not with other structural brain MRI phenotypes, highlighting its notable association with the superior temporal regions. Diffusion MRI emphasized an association with the fractional anisotropy of the left auditory fibers of the corpus callosum and with networks involved in linguistic processing in resting-state functional MRI. Overall, this evidence demonstrates a specific relationship between this locus and the establishment of the superior temporal regions that support human communication.",

Our mathematical model focuses on the macrophage-bacteria system, implicitly accounting for host immunity, and illustrates three infection scenarios driven by the balance between bacterial growth and death processes. Our analysis reveals critical parameter combinations for the intracellular vs. extracellular fitness advantage of persistent bacteria, and the drivers of overall infection success across acute and persistent regimes.

    "abstract": "Acute pancreatitis (AP) is sudden onset pancreas inflammation that causes multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and death in certain individuals who develop AP yet minimal systemic inflammation in others. Here, we show that this observed diversity in systemic response and outcome is accompagnied by diversity in molecular subtypes that can be identified using computational analysis of clinical and multiomic data. We integrated co-incident whole blood transcriptomic, plasma proteomic, and serum metabolomic data at serial time points from a cohort of patients presenting with AP and systematically evaluated four different metrics for patient similarity, using unbiased mathematical, biological and clinical measures of internal and external validity. Our results identify four distinct and stable AP endotypes that are characterized by pathway and biomarker combination stereotypes into hypermetabolic, hepatopancreaticobiliary, catabolic and innate immune endotypes. The catabolic endotype in AP strikingly recapitulates a disease endotype previously reported in acute respiratory distress syndrome, a recognized complication of AP. Our findings demonstrate that clinically-relevant and generalizable endotypes exist in AP.",

    "abstract": "Na+/H+ antiporters exchange sodium ions (Na+) and protons (H+) on opposite sides of lipid membranes, using the gradient of one ion to drive the uphill transport of the other. The electroneutral Na+/H+ antiporter NhaP from archaea Pyrococcus abyssi (PaNhaP) is a functional homolog of the human Na+/H+ exchanger NHE1, which is an important drug target. Here we resolve the Na+ and H+ transport cycle of PaNhaP in continuous and unbiased molecular dynamics trajectories that cover the entire transport cycle. We overcome the enormous time-scale gap between seconds-scale ion exchange and microseconds simulations by transition-path shooting. In this way, we selectively capture the rare events in which the six-helix-bundle transporter domain spontaneously moves up and down to shuttle protons and ions across the membrane. The simulations reveal two hydrophobic gates above and below the ion-binding sites that open and close in response to the bundle motion. Weakening the outside gate by mutagenesis makes the transporter faster, suggesting that the gate balances competing demands of fidelity and efficiency. Transition-path sampling and a committor-based reaction coordinate optimization identify the essential motions and interactions that realize conformational alternation between the two access states in transporter function.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA key concept of the hygiene hypothesis is that the microbiome modulates both epithelial barrier integrity as well as host immune responses. Defective expression of tight junction complex proteins alters this homeostatic process, and plays a role in atopic disorders including eosinophilic esophagitis. We tested the hypothesis that Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) stimulation improves esophageal barrier function in a cell-intrinsic manner by upregulation of TJ-protein expression using an in vitro model of human epithelium.\n\nMethodsPattern recognition receptor expression was assessed in esophageal epithelial cells from patients with EoE and non-EoE control patients. Functional consequences of TLR2 stimulation were investigated using human esophageal EPC2-hTERT cells in the three-dimensional air-liquid interface culture (ALI) model to evaluate transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and FITC-Dextran permeability. Characterization of TLR2-stimulated ALI cultures was performed by histology, immunohistochemistry, western blotting and chromatin immunoprecipitation.\n\nResultsTLR2 stimulation increased TEER (1.28 to 1.31-fold) and decreased paracellular permeability to FITC-Dextran. Notably, TLR2 stimulation-induced increases in TEER were abolished by treatment with anti-TLR2 blocking antibody. Tight junction complex proteins claudin 1 and zonula occludens 1 were increased following TLR2 stimulation, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated significant increase in histone 4 acetyl binding at the CLDN1 enhancer and promoter following zymosan treatment, implying the occurrence of durable chromatin changes in the esophageal epithelium.\n\nConclusionsOur findings reveal that the TLR2 pathway may play a regulatory role as a mechanism that maintains epithelial barrier homeostasis in the esophagus.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionProprioception (perception of ones limb position) is critical for accurate and consistent movement, and is processed by the sensorimotor cortex. Increased prefrontal activity is associated with improved proprioception and motor performance. Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been found to increase activity of the sensorimotor cortex. Thus, this study aimed to investigate whether anodal tDCS of the DLPFC may enhance proprioception measured with a target task. It was hypothesized that tDCS over the left DLPFC would improve motor performance (error and variability) on a target task completed without vision.\n\nDesignSingle blind, within-participant, sham-controlled trial.\n\nMethodsFifteen healthy young adults (M:F=6:9, age=23.3 years) completed 18 trials of a computerized target task (manipulating a mouse) with their non-dominant upper-limb, with and without vision, before and after (pre/post assessment) 20-minutes of stimulation (anodal tDCS of the left DLPFC) and sham conditions. Averages and coefficient of variation (CV, variability between trials) of spatio-temporal parameters associated with the movement were measured. Stimulation/ sham sessions were counterbalanced (stimulation first session, n=8), with each session separated by one week. Repeated-measures ANOVA and pairwise comparisons (95% confidence intervals [CI]) were conducted.\n\nResultsRegarding distance travelled CV, a significant interaction between condition and assessment (F(1,14)=5.09, p=0.041) demonstrated that variability was significantly less post-stimulation compared to pre (p=0.003). A significant interaction between assessment and vision (F(1,14)=30.08, p<0.001) regarding distance travelled CV showed that without vision, variability was significantly less at post compared to pre (p<0.001), and this decrease was found after the stimulation condition only (95% CI = {Delta} 7.4 +/- 1.6 [4.0 to 10.9]).\n\nConclusionSince variability of distance travelled during the target task without vision was lower post-stimulation compared to pre, consistency of movement without vision, and therefore proprioception, may have been enhanced by anodal tDCS of the DLPFC. This improvement could be due to modulation of fronto-striatal-thalamic circuits. These findings may be the first step in developing tDCS methods as an effective adjunct therapy for dysfunctional proprioception in various disorders, such as Parkinsons disease.",

    "abstract": "Strigolactones (SLs) are endogenous signalling molecules that play important roles in controlling plant development. SL perception is closely related to that of karrikins, smoke-derived compounds presumed to mimic endogenous signalling molecules (KLs). SLs have been suggested to regulate root development. However, perception of both molecules requires the F-box protein MAX2 and the use of max2 mutants has hampered defining the exact role of SLs in roots. Here we dissect the role of SL and KL signalling in Arabidopsis root development using mutants defective in the /{beta} hydrolase receptors D14 and KAI2, which specifically perceive SLs and KLs, respectively. Both pathways together regulate lateral root density (LRD), but contrary to previous reports, KL signalling alone controls root hair density, root hair length and additionally root skewing, straightness and diameter. Members of the SMXL protein family are downstream targets of SL (SMXL6, 7, 8) and KL (SMAX1, SMXL2) signalling. We identified distinct and overlapping roles of these proteins in the regulation of root development. Both SMAX1/SMXL2 and SMXL6/SMXL7/SMXL8 regulate LRD, confirming that SL and KL signalling act together to regulate this trait, while the KL-signalling specific SMAX1 and SMXL2 regulate all other investigated root traits. Finally, we show that KL signalling regulates root hair development by modulating auxin distribution within the root.",
