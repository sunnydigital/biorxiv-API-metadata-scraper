    "abstract": "Mycobacterium is a diverse bacterial genus ubiquitous in many soil and aquatic environments. Members of this genus have been associated with human and other animal diseases, including the nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), which are of growing relevance to public health worldwide. Although soils are often considered an important source of environmentally-acquired NTM infections, the biodiversity and ecological preferences of soil mycobacteria remain largely unexplored across contrasting climates and ecosystem types. Using a culture-independent approach by combining 16S rRNA marker gene sequencing with mycobacterial-specific hsp65 gene sequencing, we analyzed the diversity, distributions, and environmental preferences of soil-dwelling mycobacteria in 143 soil samples collected from across the globe. The surveyed soils harbored highly diverse mycobacterial communities that span the full-extent of the known mycobacterial phylogeny, with most soil mycobacteria belonging to previously undescribed lineages. While the genus Mycobacterium tended to have higher relative abundances in cool, wet, and acidic soil environments, several individual mycobacterial clades had contrasting environmental preferences. We identified the environmental preferences of many mycobacterial clades, including the clinically-relevant M. avium complex that was more commonly detected in wet and acidic soils. However, most of the soil mycobacteria detected were not closely related to known pathogens, calling into question previous assumptions about the general importance of soil as a source of NTM infections. Together this work provides novel insights into the diversity, distributions and ecological preferences of soil mycobacteria, and lays the foundation for future efforts to link mycobacterial phenotypes to their distributions.\n\nImportanceMycobacteria are common inhabitants of soil, and while most members of the bacterial genus are innocuous, some mycobacteria can cause environmentally-acquired infections of humans and other animals. Human infections from nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are increasingly prevalent worldwide, and some areas appear to be  hotspots for NTM disease. While exposure to soil is frequently implicated as an important mode of NTM transmission, the diversity, distributions and ecological preferences of soil mycobacteria remain poorly understood. We analyzed 143 soils from across the globe and found that the genus Mycobacterium and lineages within the genus often exhibited predictable preferences for specific environmental conditions. Soils harbor large amounts of previously-undescribed mycobacterial diversity, and lineages that include known pathogens were rarely detected in soil. Together these findings suggest that soil is an unlikely source of many mycobacterial infections. The biogeographical patterns we documented lend insight into the ecology of this important group of soil-dwelling bacteria.",

    "abstract": "The canonical model of eukaryotic translation posits that efficient translation initiation increases protein expression and mRNA stability. Contrary to this dogma, we show that increasing initiation rate can decrease both protein expression and stability of certain mRNAs in the budding yeast, S. cerevisiae. These mRNAs contain a stretch of poly-basic residues that cause ribosome stalling. Using computational modeling, we predict that the observed decrease in gene expression at high initiation rates occurs when ribosome collisions at stalls stimulate abortive termination of the leading ribosome and cause endonucleolytic mRNA cleavage. We test our prediction by identifying critical roles for the collision-associated quality control factors, Asc1 and Hel2 (RACK1 and ZNF598 in humans, respectively). Remarkably, hundreds of S. cerevisiae mRNAs that contain ribosome-stall sequences also exhibit lower translation efficiency. We propose that these mRNAs have undergone evolutionary selection for inefficient initiation to escape collision-stimulated reduction in gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Extinction-based procedures are often used to inhibit maladaptive fear responses. However, because extinction procedures show efficacy limitations, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been suggested as a promising add-on enhancer. In this study, we tested the effect of cathodal tDCS over extinction, to unveil the processes at play that boost the effectiveness of extinction procedures and its translational potential to the treatment of anxiety disorders.\n\nWe implemented a fear conditioning procedure whereby 41 healthy women (mean age = 20.51 {+/-} 5.0) were assigned to either cathodal tDCS (n=27) or sham tDCS (n=16). Fear responses were measured with self-reports, autonomic responses, and implicit avoidance tendencies.\n\nCathodal tDCS shows no statistically significant effect in extinction, according to self-reports, and seems to even negatively affect fear conditioned skin conductance responses. However, implicit avoidance tendencies, assessed one-to-three months after the tDCS session and extinction, reveal a group difference in the avoidance tendencies towards the neutral stimuli (F (1, 41) = 12.04, p = .001,{eta} p2 = .227), with the active cathodal tDCS groups showing a positive bias but not the sham group. This suggests a decreased generalization effect in the tDCS group with a moderate effect size. That is, cathodal tDCS may have enhanced long-term distinctiveness between threatening cues and perceptively similar neutral cues through a disambiguation process of the value of the neutral stimuli - a therapeutic target in anxiety disorders. Future studies should confirm these results and extend the study of cathodal tDCS effect on short term avoidance tendencies.",

Here we re-interpret the authors experimental results using model comparison and demonstrate that, contrary to their conclusions, their data actually supports the dual-axis rule (Page et al. 2017) and tilted azimuth model (Laurens and Angelaki 2018), where head direction cells use gravity to integrate 3D rotation signals about all cardinal axes of the head. We further show that this study is inconclusive regarding the presence of vertical orientation tuning; i.e. whether head direction cells encode 3D orientation in the horizontal and vertical planes conjunctively. Using model simulations, we demonstrate that, even if 3D tuning existed, the experimental protocol and data analyses used by Shinder and Taube (2019) would not have revealed it. We conclude that the actual experimental data of Shinder and Taube (2019) are compatible with the 3D properties of head direction cells discovered by other groups, yet incorrect conclusions were reached because of incomplete and qualitative analyses.",

    "abstract": "Neuroplasticity has classically been understood to arise through changes in synaptic strength or synaptic connectivity. A newly discovered form of neuroplasticity, neurotransmitter switching, involves changes in neurotransmitter identity. Chronic exposure to different photoperiods alters the number of dopamine (tyrosine hydroxylase, TH+) and somatostatin (SST+) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PaVN) of the hypothalamus of adult rats and results in discrete behavioral changes. Here we investigate whether photoperiod-induced neurotransmitter switching persists during aging and whether epigenetic mechanisms of histone acetylation and DNA methylation may contribute to this neurotransmitter plasticity. We show that this plasticity is robust at 1 and at 3 months but reduced in TH+ neurons at 12 months and completely abolished in both TH+ and SST+ neurons by 18 months. De novo methylation and histone 3 acetylation were observed following short-day photoperiod exposure in both TH+ and SST+ neurons at 1 and 3 months while an overall increase in methylation of SST+ neurons paralleled neuroplasticity reduction at 12 and 18 months. Histone acetylation increased in TH+ neurons and decreased in SST+ neurons following short-day exposure at 3 months while the total number of acetylated PaVN neurons remained constant. Reciprocal histone acetylation in TH+ and SST+ neurons suggests the importance of studying epigenetic regulation at the circuit level for identified cell phenotypes. The association of age-dependent reduction in neurotransmitter plasticity and changes in DNA methylation and acetylation patterns in two neuronal phenotypes known to switch transmitter identity suggests mechanistic insights into transmitter plasticity in the aging brain.\n\nSIGNIFICANCENeurotransmitter switching, like changes in synaptic strength, formation of new synapses and synapse remodeling, declines with age. This age-dependent reduction in transmitter plasticity is associated with changes in levels of DNA methylase and histone deacetylase that imply epigenetic regulation of transcription. A reciprocal pattern of histone acetylation in a single population of neurons that depends on the transmitter expressed emphasizes the value of studying epigenetic mechanisms at the level of cell phenotypes rather than cell genotypes or whole tissue. The findings may be useful for developing approaches for non-invasive treatment of disorders characterized by neurotransmitter dysfunction.",

RMP included four overlapping components: situational analysis, community engagement and mobilization, community-based biomedical and behavioral prevention, and primary health care systems strengthening. In support of the PEPFAR country-ownership paradigm, we conducted costing analysis of the RMP combination HIV prevention program to determine data needed for potential transition of to local ownership.\n\nMethodsWe used standard costing methodology for this research.\n\nResultsWe found that cost per unit of output ranged from $63.93 (cost per person reached with individual or small group prevention interventions) to $4,344.88 (cost per health facility strengthened). The RMP intervention was primarily dependent on personnel costs. This was true regardless of the time period (Year 1 vs. Year 2) or activity (i.e. wellness days or events, primary health care strengthening, community engagement, and wellness clubs).\n\nConclusionsThe development of labor-intensive rather than capital intensive interventions for low-income settings such as RMP was identified as being particularly important in treating and preventing HIV/AIDS and other health conditions in a sustainable manner. Costs were also observed to transition from international cost centers to in-country headquarters offices over time, in keeping with the transition of international to local responsibility required for sustainable PEPFAR initiatives. Such costing center evolution was also reflected by changes in the composition of the intervention, including (1) the redesign and re-deployment of service delivery sites according to local needs, uptake and implementation success and (2) the flexible and adaptable restructuring of intervention components in response to community needs.",

    "abstract": "Random regression test-day model has become the most commonly adopted model for routine genetic evaluations for different dairy populations, which allows accurately accounting for genetic and environmental effects at different periods during lactation. The objective of this study was to explore appropriate random regression test-day model for genetic evaluation of milk yield in Chinese Holstein population. Data included 419,567 test-day records from 54,417 cows in the first lactation. Variance components and breeding values were estimated using random regression test-day model with different order (first order to fifth order) of Legendre polynomials, and accounted for homogeneous or heterogeneous residual variance across the lactation. The goodness of fit of the models was evaluated by total residual variance (TRV) and - 2logL. Further, the predictive ability of the models was assessed by Spearmans rank correlation between estimated breeding values for 305d milk yield (EBV305) from the full data set and reduced data set in which the records from the last calving year were masked. The results showed that random regression models using third order Legendre polynomials (LP3) with heterogeneous residual variance achieved the lower TRV and - 2logL value and the highest correlation for EBV305 between full data and reduced data. Heritability estimated by this model was 0.250 for 305d milk yield and ranged from 0.163 to 0.304 for test-day milk yield. We suggest random regression model with Legendre polynomial of order 3 and accounting for heterogeneous residual variances could be an appropriate model to be used for genetic evaluation of milk yield for Chinese Holstein population.",

    "abstract": "Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 (EHEC) is an important food-borne pathogen that colonizes the colon. Transposon-insertion sequencing (TIS) was used to identify genes required for EHEC and commensal E. coli K-12 growth in vitro and for EHEC growth in vivo in the infant rabbit colon. Surprisingly, many conserved loci contribute to EHECs but not to K-12s growth in vitro, suggesting that gene acquisition during EHEC evolution has heightened the pathogens reliance on certain metabolic processes that are dispensable for K-12. There was a restrictive bottleneck for EHEC colonization of the rabbit colon, which complicated identification of EHEC genes facilitating growth in vivo. Both a refined version of an existing analytic framework as well as PCA-based analysis were used to compensate for the effects of the infection bottleneck. These analyses confirmed that the EHEC LEE-encoded type III secretion apparatus is required for growth in vivo and revealed that only a few effectors are critical for in vivo fitness. Numerous mutants not previously associated with EHEC survival/growth in vivo also appeared attenuated in vivo, and a subset of these putative in vivo fitness factors were validated. Some were found to contribute to efficient type-three secretion while others, including tatABC, oxyR, envC, acrAB, and cvpA, promote EHEC resistance to host-derived stresses encountered in vivo. cvpA, which is also required for intestinal growth of several other enteric pathogens, proved to be required for EHEC, Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio parahaemolyticus resistance to the bile salt deoxycholate. Collectively, our findings provide a comprehensive framework for understanding EHEC growth in the intestine.\n\nAuthor SummaryEnterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) are important food-borne pathogens that infect the colon. We created a highly saturated EHEC transposon library and used transposon insertion sequencing to identify the genes required for EHEC growth in vitro and in vivo in the infant rabbit colon. We found that there is a large infection bottleneck in the rabbit model of intestinal colonization, and refined two analytic approaches to facilitate rigorous identification of new EHEC genes that promote fitness in vivo. Besides the known type III secretion system, more than 200 additional genes were found to contribute to EHEC survival and/or growth within the intestine. The requirement for some of these new in vivo fitness factors was confirmed, and their contributions to infection were investigated. This set of genes should be of considerable value for future studies elucidating the processes that enable the pathogen to proliferate in vivo and for design of new therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "During the stringent response, bacteria synthesize guanosine-3,5-bis(diphosphate) (ppGpp) and guanosine-5-triphosphate 3-diphosphate (pppGpp), which act as secondary messengers to promote cellular survival and adaptation. (p)ppGpp  alarmones are synthesized and/or hydrolyzed by proteins belonging to the RelA/SpoT Homologue (RSH) family. Many bacteria also encode  small alarmone synthetase (SAS) proteins (e.g. RelP, RelQ) which may also be capable of synthesizing a third alarmone: guanosine-5-phosphate 3-diphosphate (pGpp). Here, we report the biochemical properties of the Rel (RSH), RelP and RelQ proteins from Staphylococcus aureus (Sa-Rel, Sa-RelP, Sa-RelQ, respectively). Sa-Rel synthesized pppGpp more efficiently than ppGpp, but lacked the ability to produce pGpp. However, Sa-Rel efficiently hydrolyzed all three alarmones in a Mn(II) ion-dependent manner. The removal of the C-terminal regulatory domain of Sa-Rel increased its rate of (p)ppGpp synthesis ca. 10-fold, but had negligible effects on its rate of (pp)pGpp hydrolysis. Sa-RelP and Sa-RelQ efficiently synthesized pGpp in addition to pppGpp and ppGpp. The alarmone-synthesizing abilities of Sa-RelQ, but not Sa-RelP, were allosterically-stimulated by the addition of pppGpp, ppGpp or pGpp. The respective (pp)pGpp-synthesizing activities of Sa-RelP/Sa-RelQ were compared and contrasted with SAS homologues from Enterococcus faecalis (Ef-RelQ) and Streptococcus mutans (Sm-RelQ, Sm-RelP). Results indicated that EF-RelQ, Sm-RelQ and Sa-RelQ were functionally-equivalent; but exhibited considerable variations in their respective biochemical properties, and the degrees to which alarmones and single-stranded RNA molecules allosterically stimulated their respective alarmone-synthesizing activities. The respective (pp)pGpp-synthesizing capabilities of Sa-RelP and Sm-RelP proteins were inhibited by pGpp, ppGpp and pppGpp. Our results support the premise that RelP and RelQ proteins may synthesize pGpp in addition to (p)ppGpp within S. aureus and other Gram-positive bacterial species.",

    "abstract": "Land cover change is a key component of anthropogenic global environmental change, contributing to changes in environmental conditions of habitats. These changes can lead to the redistribution of species and shifts in the functional composition and properties of ecosystems. Deforestation is globally the most widespread anthropogenically driven land cover change leading to conversion from closed forest to open non-forest habitat. The consequences of these functional habitat changes on species distributions are only poorly understood. This study investigates the relative roles of geographic features, species climatic niche characteristics and species traits in determining the ability of open-habitat plant species to take advantage of recently opened habitats. We use current occurrence records of 18 herbaceous, predominantly open-habitat species of the genus Acaena (Rosaceae) to determine their prevalence in recently opened habitat. Geographic features of the spatial distribution of open habitat, species climatic niche characteristics, and species traits related to dispersal were tested their correlation with species prevalence in anthropogenically opened habitat. While primary open habitat (naturally open) was characterised by cold climates, secondary open habitat (naturally closed but anthropogenically opened) is characterised by warmer and wetter conditions. We found high levels of variation in the prevalence of secondary open habitat among the investigated species indicating differences between species in their ability to colonise newly opened habitat. For the species investigated, geographical and climatic niche factors showed generally stronger relationships with species prevalence in secondary open habitat than functional traits did. For small herbaceous species, geographical and environmental factors appear to be more important than species functional traits for facilitating expansion into secondary open habitats. Our results suggested that the land cover change might have triggered the shifts of factors controlling open-habitat plant distributions from the competition with forest trees to current environmental constraints.",

Here we show that the plasticity of metastatic breast cancer cells can be promoted by the activity of the RUNX transcription factors. We demonstrate that the RUNX co-regulator CBF{beta} is essential to maintain the mesenchymal phenotype of triple-negative breast cancer cells and that CBF{beta}-depleted cells undergo a mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) and re-organise into acini-like structures, reminiscent of those formed by epithelial breast cells. We subsequently show, using an inducible CBF{beta} system, that the MET can be reversed, thus demonstrating the plasticity of RUNX/CBF{beta}-mediated EMT. Moreover, the MET can be reversed by expression of the EMT transcription factor Slug whose expression is dependent on CBF{beta}, RUNX1 and RUNX2. Finally, we demonstrate that loss of CBF{beta} inhibits the ability of metastatic breast cancer cells to invade bone cell cultures and suppresses their ability to form bone metastases in vivo. Together our findings demonstrate that the RUNX/CBF{beta} complexes can determine the plasticity of the metastatic cancer cell phenotypes, suggesting that their regulation in different micro-environments may play a key role in the establishment of metastatic tumours.",

    "abstract": "PRDM14 is a crucial regulator of mouse primordial germ cells (mPGC), epigenetic reprogramming and pluripotency, but its role in the evolutionarily divergent regulatory network of human PGCs (hPGCs) remains unclear. Besides, a previous knockdown study indicated that PRDM14 might be dispensable for human germ cell fate. Here, we decided to use inducible degrons for a more rapid and comprehensive PRDM14 depletion. We show that PRDM14 loss results in significantly reduced specification efficiency and an aberrant transcriptome of human PGC-like cells (hPGCLCs) obtained in vitro from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Chromatin immunoprecipitation and transcriptomic analyses suggest that PRDM14 cooperates with TFAP2C and BLIMP1 to upregulate germ cell and pluripotency genes, while repressing WNT signalling and somatic markers. Notably, PRDM14 targets are not conserved between mouse and human, emphasising the divergent molecular mechanisms of PGC specification. The effectiveness of degrons for acute protein depletion is widely applicable in various developmental contexts.",
