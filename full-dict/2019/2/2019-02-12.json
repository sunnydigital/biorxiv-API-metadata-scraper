    "abstract": "Living cells rely on small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) to regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Contrary to most protein-based activators of transcription, all known riboregulators do not exploit cooperative binding mechanisms to activate gene expression. We conceived a general strategy to design cooperative riboregulation by programming a hierarchical toehold activation cascade, which we implemented into a de novo sequence design algorithm. We engineered different riboregulatory systems relying on the conditional formation of a heterotrimeric species. We characterized the specificity of each RNA-RNA interaction in vitro and the cooperative activation of gene expression in Escherichia coli. As we only rely on a biochemical model to compute allosteric regulation, our strategy could be applied to reach more complex RNA-based nanostructures regulating gene expression for synthetic biology applications.",

Early odor-exposure increases adult chemo-attraction to the same cues.

Naive worms fed on tRNAAla (UGC) purified from odor-experienced worms, acquire odor-specific imprints.\n\nChemo-attractive responses require the tRNA-modifying Elongator complex sub-units 1 (elpc-1) and 3 (elpc-3) genes. elpc-3 deletions impair chemo-attraction, which is fully restored by wild-type tRNAAla (UGC) feeding. A stably inherited decrease of odor-specific responses ensues from early odor-exposition of elpc-1 deletion mutants.\n\ntRNAAla (UGC) may adopt various chemical forms to mediate the cross-talk between innately-programmed and environment-directed chemo-attractive behavior.",

    "abstract": "The minimum covariance determinant (MCD) algorithm is one of the most common techniques to detect anomalous or outlying observations. The MCD algorithm depends on two features of multivariate data: the determinant of a matrix (i.e., geometric mean of the eigenvalues) and Mahalanobis distances (MD). While the MCD algorithm is commonly used, and has many extensions, the MCD is limited to analyses of quantitative data and more specifically data assumed to be continuous. One reason why the MCD does not extend to other data types such as categorical or ordinal data is because there is not a well-defined MD for data types other than continuous data. To address the lack of MCD-like techniques for categorical or mixed data we present a generalization of the MCD. To do so, we rely on a multivariate technique called correspondence analysis (CA). Through CA we can define MD via singular vectors and also compute the determinant from CAs eigenvalues. Here we define and illustrate a generalized MCD on categorical data and then show how our generalized MCD extends beyond categorical data to accommodate mixed data types (e.g., categorical, ordinal, and continuous). We illustrate this generalized MCD on data from two large scale projects: the Ontario Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative (ONDRI) and the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), with genetics (categorical), clinical instruments and surveys (categorical or ordinal), and neuroimaging (continuous) data. We also make R code and toy data available in order to illustrate our generalized MCD.",

The functions of SL trans-splicing, however, remain largely enigmatic. Here, we quantified translation genome-wide in the marine chordate, Oikopleura dioica, under inhibition of mTOR, a central growth regulator. Translation of trans-spliced TOP mRNAs was suppressed, showing that the SL sequence permits nutrient-dependent translational control of growth-related mRNAs. Under crowded, nutrient-limiting conditions, O. dioica continues to filter-feed, but arrests growth until favorable conditions return. Upon release from such conditions, initial recovery was independent of nutrient-responsive, trans-spliced genes, suggesting animal density sensing as a first trigger for resumption of development. Our results demonstrate a role for trans-splicing in the coordinated translational down-regulation of nutrient-responsive genes under limiting conditions.",

To investigate the spatial scale of aphid epidemics, we have developed a spatio-temporal stochastic aphid population growth model, and fitted the model to empirical spatial time-series aphid population data using a Bayesian hierarchical fitting procedure. Furthermore, detailed spatial data of the initial phases of epidemic development was investigated in a semivariogram. Our results suggest that there is limited spatial variation in the initial occurrence probability at a spatial scale of 10 km. Consequently, the results support the hypothesis that initial aphid population sizes and epidemics may be predicted in fields within a 10 km radius. For farmers, this may imply that they can rely their decision of whether to spray against aphids on observations made by other nearby farmers or by the consultancy service.",

    "abstract": "Cerebellar Purkinje cells integrate sensory information with motor efference copies to adapt movements to behavioural and environmental requirements. They produce complex spikes that are triggered by the activity of climbing fibres originating in neurons of the inferior olive. These complex spikes can shape the onset, amplitude and direction of movements as well as the adaptation of such movements to sensory feedback. Clusters of nearby inferior olive neurons project to parasagittally aligned stripes of Purkinje cells, referred to as \"microzones\". It is currently unclear to what extent individual Purkinje cells within a single microzone integrate climbing fibre inputs from multiple sources of different sensory origins, and to what extent sensory-evoked climbing fibre responses depend on the strength and recent history of activation. Here we imaged complex spike responses in cerebellar lobule crus 1 to various types of sensory stimulation in awake mice. We find that different sensory modalities and receptive fields have a mild, but consistent, tendency to converge on individual Purkinje cells. Purkinje cells encoding the same stimulus show increased events with coherent complex spike firing and tend to lie close together. Moreover, whereas complex spike firing is only mildly affected by variations in stimulus strength, it strongly depends on the recent history of climbing fibre activity. Our data point towards a mechanism in the olivo-cerebellar system that regulates complex spike firing during mono- or multisensory stimulation around a relatively low set-point, highlighting an integrative coding scheme of complex spike firing under homeostatic control.",

    "abstract": "As communication signal properties change, through genetic drift or selective pressure, the sensory systems that receive these signals must also adapt to maintain sensitivity and adaptability in an array of contexts. Shedding light on this process helps us understand how sensory codes are tailored to specific tasks. In a species of weakly electric fish, Apteronotus albifrons, we examined the unique neurophysiological properties that support the encoding of electrosensory communication signals that the animal encounters in social exchanges. We compare our findings to known coding properties of the closely related species, Apteronotus leptorhynchus, to establish how these animals differ in their ability to encode their distinctive communication signals. While there are many similarities between these two species, we found notable differences leading to relatively poor coding of the details of chirp structure occurring on high-frequency background beats. As a result, small differences in chirp properties are poorly resolved by the nervous system. We performed behavioral tests to relate A. albifrons chirp coding strategies to its use of chirps during social encounters. Our results suggest that A. albifrons do not exchange frequent chirps in non-breeding condition, particularly when the beat frequency is high. These findings parallel the mediocre chirp coding accuracy in that they both point to a reduced reliance on frequent and rich exchange of information through chirps during these social interactions. Therefore, our study suggests that neural coding strategies in the central nervous system vary across species in a way that parallels the behavioral use of the sensory signals.\n\nSIGNIFICANCESender-receiver matching is a phenomenon commonly observed in the peripheral nervous system. It enables communication production and reception to evolve together so that conspecifics remain sensitive to important signals. In this manuscript we examine this phenomenon in the central nervous system of the weakly electric fish A. albifrons and compare its processing of communication signals to a closely related species (A. leptorhynchus). Although some differences across the two species can help tailor the system for processing species-specific signals, our data indicate that encoding of communication signals in A. albifrons is not as sensitive as in A. leptorhynchus for certain categories of signals. Our data support the idea that the extent of sender-receiver matching can vary as a function of behavioral needs.",

    "abstract": "People are able to keep track of objects as they navigate through space, even when objects are out of sight. This requires some kind of representation of the scene and of the observers location but the form this representation might take is debated. We tested the accuracy and reliability of observers estimates of the visual direction of previously-viewed targets. Participants viewed 4 objects from one location, with binocular vision and small head movements giving information about the 3D locations of the objects. Without any further sight of the targets, participants walked to another location and pointed towards them. All the conditions were tested in an immersive virtual environment and some were also carried out in a real scene. Participants made large, consistent pointing errors that are poorly explained by any consistent 3D representation. Instead, if a 3D representation is to account for the data it would need to be one where the target boxes were squashed, almost into a plane, quite far away from the true location of the boxes and in different places depending on the orientation of the obscuring wall at the moment the participant points. In short, our data show that the mechanisms for updating visual direction of unseen targets are not based on a stable 3D model of the scene, even a distorted one.",

We used a novel approach involving labeling of intact channels in a native, membrane environment with a non-canonical fluorescent amino acid and measurement (using FRET with fluorescent nucleotides) of steady-state and time-resolved nucleotide binding to dissect the role of NBS2 of the accessory SUR1 subunit of KATP in channel gating. Binding to NBS2 was Mg2+-independent, but Mg was required to trigger a conformational change in SUR1. Mutation of a lysine (K1384A) in NBS2 that coordinates bound nucleotides increased the EC50 for trinitrophenyl-ADP binding to NBS2, but only in the presence of Mg2+, indicating that this mutation disrupts the ligand-induced conformational change. Comparison of nucleotide-binding with ionic currents suggests a model in which each nucleotide binding event to NBS2 of SUR1 is independent and promotes KATP activation by the same amount.",

    "abstract": "Under typical daytime light levels, the human pupillary light response (PLR) is driven by the activity of the L, M, and S cones, and melanopsin expressed in the so-called intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). However, the importance of each of these photoreceptive mechanisms in defining pupil size under real-world viewing conditions remains to be established. To address this question, we embedded photoreceptor-specific modulations in a movie displayed using a novel projector-based five-primary spatial stimulation system, which allowed for the precise control of photoreceptor activations in time and space. We measured the pupillary light response in eleven observers, who viewed short cartoon movies which contained hidden low-frequency (0.25 Hz) silent-substitution modulations of the L, M and S cones (no stimulation of melanopsin), melanopsin (no stimulation of L, M and S cones), both L, M, and S cones and melanopsin or no modulation at all. We find that all photoreceptors active at photopic light levels regulate pupil size under this condition. Our data imply that embedding modulations in photoreceptor contrast could provide a method to manipulate key adaptive aspects of the human visual system in everyday, real-world activities such as watching a movie.",

    "abstract": "ChIP-seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing) is a high-throughput technique to identify genomic regions that are bound in vivo by a particular protein, e.g., a transcription factor (TF). Biological factors, such as chromatin state, indirect and cooperative binding, as well as experimental factors, such as antibody quality, cross-linking, and PCR biases, are known to affect the outcome of ChIP-seq experiments. However, the relative impact of these factors on inferences made from ChIP-seq data is not entirely clear. Here, via a detailed ChIP-seq simulation pipeline, ChIPulate, we assess the impact of various biological and experimental sources of variation on several outcomes of a ChIP-seq experiment, viz., the recoverability of the TF binding motif, accuracy of TF-DNA binding detection, the sensitivity of inferred TF-DNA binding strength, and number of replicates needed to confidently infer binding strength. We find that the TF motif can be recovered despite poor and non-uniform extraction and PCR amplification efficiencies. The recovery of the motif is however affected to a larger extent by the fraction of sites that are either cooperatively or indirectly bound. Importantly, our simulations reveal that the number of ChIP-seq replicates needed to accurately measure in vivo occupancy at high-affinity sites is larger than the recommended community standards. Our results establish statistical limits on the accuracy of inferences of protein-DNA binding from ChIP-seq and suggest that increasing the mean extraction efficiency, rather than amplification efficiency, would better improve sensitivity.

Uncertainty lies at the core of this \"explore-exploit\" dilemma, for if all options were perfectly known, there would be no need to explore. Yet despite the prominent role of uncertainty-guided exploration in decision making, evidence for its neural implementation is still sparse. We investigated this question with model-based fMRI (n = 31) using a two-armed bandit task that independently manipulates two forms of uncertainty underlying different exploration strategies. The relative uncertainty between the two options was correlated with BOLD activity in right rostrolateral prefrontal cortex and drove directed exploration, a strategy that adds an uncertainty bonus to each option. The total uncertainty across the two options was correlated with activity in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and drove random exploration, a strategy that increases choice stochasticity in proportion to total uncertainty. The subjective estimates of uncertainty from both regions were predictive of subject choices. These results are consistent with a hybrid computational architecture in which different uncertainty computations are performed separately and then combined by downstream decision circuits to compute choice.",

This study was designed to investigate antioxidant metabolism and dehydrin expression responses to drought stress in two switchgrass cultivars (drought tolerant Alamo, and drought sensitive Dacotah) contrasting in drought tolerance. The plants were subjected to well-watered [100% evapotranspiration (ET)] or drought stress (30%-50% ET) conditions for up to 24 d in growth chambers. Drought stress decreased leaf relative water content (RWC), increased leaf electrolyte leakage (EL), leaf malondialdehyde (MDA) content in two cultivars, but Alamo exhibited higher leaf RWC level, lower leaf EL and MDA when compared to Dacotah at 24 d of drought treatment. Drought stress also increased superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities in two cultivars, Alamo had relatively higher SOD, CAT and APX activities and greater abundance of SOD and APX isozymes than Dacotah at 24 d of drought treatment. Alamo had higher abundance of 55 KDa and 18 KDa dehydrin accumulation than Dacotah under drought treatment. Relative genes expression level of PvCAT1, PvAPX2, PvERD and PvPIP1;5 in Alamo were significantly higher than Dacotah at 24 d of drought treatment. These results suggest that increase in antioxidant enzymes and accumulation of dehydrin were highly related with switchgrass drought tolerance. Antioxidant enzyme activity, isozyme expression and dehydrin abundance could provide a useful screening tool to identify relative drought tolerance in switchgrass cultivars.",

    "abstract": "Algorithmic solutions to index and search biological databases are a fundamental part of bioinformatics, providing underlying components to many end-user tools. Inexpensive next generation sequencing has filled publicly available databases such as the Sequence Read Archive beyond the capacity of traditional indexing methods. Recently, the Sequence Bloom Tree (SBT) and its derivatives were proposed as a way to efficiently index such data for queries about transcript presence. We build on the SBT framework to construct the HowDe-SBT data structure, which uses a novel partitioning of information to reduce the construction and query time as well as the size of the index. We evaluate HowDe-SBT by both proving theoretical bounds on its performance and using real RNA-seq data. Compared to previous SBT methods, HowDe-SBT can construct the index in less than 36% the time, and with 39% less space, and can answer small-batch queries at least five times faster. HowDe-SBT is available as a free open source program on https://github.com/medvedevgroup/HowDeSBT.",

    "abstract": "Biodiversity can be represented by a variety of different dimensions (e.g. functional diversity, phylogenetic diversity, genetic diversity and taxonomic diversity). While the many different representations of biodiversity can lead to a more complete description of communities, they also lead to a degree of  fragmentation of the biodiversity concept. Developing a unified measure that integrates all the dimensions of biodiversity is a theoretical solution for this problem, however, it remains an operationally utopian task. Alternatively, quantifying the dimensionality of biodiversity is a way to integrate the different dimensions of biological diversity. This concept is explored in the present study. We define the dimensionality of diversity as the number of different diversity metrics needed to effectively describe biodiversity. We provide a solution that joins the two components of dimensionality (correlation and the variation of each diversity metric) in the same framework, allowing us to quantify dimensionality. We show, through a simulation study, that considering the correlation among dimensions with the variation of each dimension offers important information that is neglected when only correlation information (the component used in the current methodology to measure dimensionality) is considered. We demonstrate how to apply the proposed framework by investigating the dimensionality of South American small mammal communities (cricetids and marsupials). Our example demonstrates that the taxonomic dimension of diversity captures most of the spatial variation among these communities. We conclude by highlighting the greater understanding of dimensionality that is obtained through this method, as well as the insights it provides into the importance of each diversity metric to the whole biodiversity space, insights which can not be obtained through the current common method.",

Tools to visualize, annotate and analyse results from these studies can be used to generate hypotheses about the molecular mechanisms underlying the associations.\n\nFindingsThe Complex-Traits Genetics Virtual Lab (CTG-VL) integrates over a thousand publicly-available GWAS summary statistics, a suite of analysis tools, visualization functions and diverse data sets for genomic annotations. CTG-VL also makes available results from gene, pathway and tissue-based analyses from over 1,500 complex-traits allowing to assess pleiotropy not only at the genetic variant level but also at the gene, pathway and tissue levels. In this manuscript, we showcase the platform by analysing GWAS summary statistics of mood swings derived from UK Biobank. Using analysis tools in CTG-VL we highlight hippocampus as a potential tissue involved in mood swings, and that pathways including neuron apoptotic process may underlie the genetic associations. Further, we report a negative genetic correlation with educational attainment rG = -0.41 {+/-} 0.018 and a potential causal effect of BMI on mood swings OR = 1.01 (95% CI = 1.00-1.02). Using CTG-VLs database, we show that pathways and tissues associated with mood swings are also associated with neurological traits including reaction time and neuroticism, as well as traits such age at menopause and age at first live birth.\n\nConclusionsCTG-VL is a platform with the most complete set of tools to carry out post-GWAS analyses.

    "abstract": "Phase separation in mixed lipid systems has been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically because of its biological importance. A detailed description of such complex systems undoubtedly requires novel mathematical frameworks that are capable to decompose and categorize the evolution of thousands if not millions of lipids involved in the phenomenon. The interpretation and analysis of Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations representing temporal and spatial changes in such systems is still a challenging task. Here, we present a new unsupervised machine learning approach based on Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, called NMFk, that successfully extracts physically meaningful features from neighborhood profiles derived from coarse-grained MD simulations of ternary lipid mixture. Our results demonstrate that leveraging NMFk can (a) determine the role of different lipid molecules in phase separation, (b) characterize the formation of nano-domains of lipids, (c) determine the timescales of interest and (d) extract physically meaningful features that uniquely describe the phase separation with broad implications.",

    "abstract": "All life exchanges molecules with its environment. While these metabolites are commonly measured in terrestrial and limnic ecosystems, the presence of salt in marine habitats has hampered quantitative analyses of the ocean metabolome. To overcome these limitations, we developed SeaMet, a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method that detects hundreds of metabolites down to nano-molar concentrations in less than one milliliter of seawater. Using a set of metabolites dissolved in artificial seawater to benchmark our method, we show metabolite signal detection increased on average across ions by 324 fold in comparison to standard GC-MS methods. Our observed signal improvement occurred across tested metabolite classes and provides reproducible and quantifiable results. To showcase the capabilities of our method, we used SeaMet to explore the production and consumption of metabolites during culture of a heterotrophic bacteria that is widespread in the North Sea. Our approach revealed successional uptake of amino acids, while sugars were not consumed, and highlight the power of metabolomics in providing insights into nutrient uptake and energy conservation in marine microorganisms. We also applied SeaMet to explore the in situ metabolome of coral reef and mangrove sediment porewaters. Despite the fact that these ecosystems occur in nutrient-poor waters, we uncovered a remarkable diversity and abundance of sugars and fatty acids, compounds predicted to be rapidly consumed by marine microorganisms. Our method advances marine metabolomics by enabling the unbiased, and quantitative analysis of marine metabolites, and will help provide new insights into carbon cycle dynamics and ocean biogeochemistry.\n\nSignificanceMetabolites are the chemical currency of cellular metabolism across all domains of life. However, describing metabolites that occur in the oceans is lagging behind similar studies conducted on land. The central challenge in marine metabolomics is that salt prevents the comprehensive analysis of metabolites in seawater. We developed a method, SeaMet, that overcomes the limitations of salt on metabolite detection. SeaMet provides a time and cost efficient method, using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, for the reproducible identification and quantification of a broad range of marine compounds. Considering the oceans contain the largest organic carbon pool on Earth, describing the marine metabolome is critical for understanding the drivers behind element cycles, biotic interactions, ecosystem function, and atmospheric CO2 storage.",

    "abstract": "Lake-dwelling fish that form species pairs/flocks characterized by body size divergence are important model systems for speciation research. While several sources of divergent selection have been identified in these systems, their importance for driving the speciation process remains elusive. A major problem is that in retrospect, we cannot distinguish selection pressures that initiated divergence from those acting later in the process. To address this issue, we reconstructed the initial stages of speciation in European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) using data from 357 populations of varying age (26-10 000 years). We find that whitefish speciation is driven by a large-growing predator, the northern pike (Esox lucius). Pike initiates divergence by causing a largely plastic differentiation into benthic giants and pelagic dwarfs; ecotypes that will subsequently develop partial reproductive isolation and heritable differences in gill raker number. Using an eco-evolutionary model, we demonstrate how pikes habitat specificity and large gape size are critical for imposing a between-habitat trade-off, causing prey to mature in a safer place or at a safer size. Thereby, we propose a novel mechanism for how predators may cause dwarf/giant speciation in lake-dwelling fish species.",

    "abstract": "Metabolism of energy reserves are essential for bacterial functions such as pathogenicity, metabolic adaptation, and environmental persistence, etc. Previous bioinformatics studies have linked gain or loss of energy reserves such as glycogen and polyphosphate (polyP) with host-pathogen interactions and bacterial virulence based on a comparatively small number of bacterial genomes or proteomes. Thus, understanding the distribution patterns of energy reserves metabolism across bacterial species provides a shortcut route to look into bacterial lifestyle and physiology theoretically. So far, five major energy reserves have been identified in bacteria due to their effective capacity to support bacterial persistence under nutrient deprivation conditions, which include wax ester (WE), triacylglycerol (TAG), polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), polyphosphate, and glycogen. Although unknown pathways directly involved in energy reserves keep being discovered with the continuous endeavour of molecular microbiologists and it is currently rather clear about the enzymes related with the metabolism of energy reserves, there is a lack of systematic study of the pathway or key enzyme distributions of the five energy reserves in bacteria from an evolutionary point of view. With the fast development of sequencing technology, abundant bacterial proteomes are available in public database now. In this study, we sourced 8214 manually reviewed bacterial reference proteomes from UniProt database and used statistical models to search homologous sequences of key enzymes related with energy reserves. The distribution patterns of the pathways for energy reserves metabolism are visualized in taxonomy-based phylogenetic trees. According to the study, it was revealed that specific pathways and enzymes are associated with certain types of bacterial groups, which provides evolutionary insights into the understanding of their origins and functions. In addition, the study also confirmed that loss of energy reserves is correlated with bacterial genome reduction. Through this analysis, a much clearer picture about energy reserves metabolism in bacteria is present, which could serve a guide for further theoretical and experimental analyses of energy reserves metabolism in bacteria.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThird-generation sequencing technologies Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore allow the sequencing of long reads of tens of kbp, that are expected to solve various problems, such as contig and haplotype assembly, scaffolding, and structural variant calling. However, they also display high error rates that can reach 10 to 30%, for basic ONT and non-CCS PacBio reads. As a result, error correction is often the first step of projects dealing with long reads. As first long reads sequencing experiments produced reads displaying error rates higher than 15% on average, most methods relied on the complementary use of short reads data to perform correction, in a hybrid approach. However, these sequencing technologies evolve fast, and the error rate of the long reads now reaches 10 to 12%. As a result, self-correction is now frequently used as the first step of third-generation sequencing data analysis projects. As of today, efficient tools allowing to perform self-correction of the long reads are available, and recent observations suggest that avoiding the use of second-generation sequencing reads could bypass their inherent bias.\n\nResultsWe introduce CONSENT, a new method for the self-correction of long reads that combines different strategies from the state-of-the-art. More precisely, we combine a multiple sequence alignment strategy with the use of local de Bruijn graphs. Moreover, the multiple sequence alignment benefits from an efficient segmentation strategy based on k-mer chaining, which allows a considerable speed improvement. Our experiments show that CONSENT compares well to the latest state-of-the-art self-correction methods, and even outperforms them on real Oxford Nanopore datasets. In particular, they show that CONSENT is the only method able to efficiently scale to the correction of Oxford Nanopore ultra-long reads, and is able to process a full human dataset, containing reads reaching lengths up to 1.5 Mbp, in 15 days. Additionally, CONSENT also implements an assembly polishing feature, and is thus able to correct errors directly from raw long read assemblies. Our experiments show that CONSENT outperforms state-of-the-art polishing tools in terms of resource consumption, and provides comparable results. Moreover, we also show that, for a full human dataset, assembling the raw data and polishing the assembly afterwards is less time consuming than assembling the corrected reads, while providing better quality results.\n\nAvailability and implementationCONSENT is implemented in C++, supported on Linux platforms and freely available at https://github.com/morispi/CONSENT.\n\nContactpierre.morisse2@univ-rouen.fr",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDNA methylation reflect health-related environmental exposures and genetic risk, providing insights into aetiological mechanisms and potentially predicting disease onset, progression and treatment response. An increasingly recognised need for large-scale, longitudinally-profiled samples collected world-wide has made the development of efficient and straightforward sample collection and storage procedures a pressing issue. An alternative to the low-temperature storage of EDTA tubes of venous blood samples, which are frequently the source of the DNA used in such studies, is to collect and store at room temperature blood samples using filter paper engineered for the purpose, such as Whatman FTA(R) cards. Our goal was to determine whether DNA stored in this manner can be used to generate DNA methylation profiles comparable to those generated using blood samples frozen in EDTA tubes.\n\nMethodsDNA methylation profiles were obtained from matched EDTA tube and Whatman FTA(R) card whole-blood samples from 62 Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study participants using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Multiple quality control procedures were implemented, the relationship between the two sample types assessed, and EWASs performed for smoking status, age and the interaction between these variables and sample storage method. Results: Dried blood spot (DBS) DNA methylation profiles were of good quality and DNA methylation profiles from matched DBS and EDTA tube samples were highly correlated (mean r = 0.991) and could distinguish between participants. EWASs replicated established associations for smoking and age, with no evidence for moderation by storage method.\n\nConclusionsOur results support the use of Whatman FTA(R) cards for collecting and storing blood samples for DNA methylation profiling. This approach is likely to be particularly beneficial for large-scale studies and those carried out in areas where freezer access is limited. Furthermore, our results will inform consideration of the use of newborn heel prick DBSs for research use.",

    "abstract": "ADHD affects 5% of children world-wide. Of these, two-thirds continue to have impairing symptoms of ADHD into adulthood. Although a large literature implicates structural brain differences in the pathophysiology of the disorder, it is not clear if adults with ADHD have similar neuroanatomical impairments as those seen in children with recent reports from the large ENIGMA-ADHD consortium finding structural abnormalities for children but not for adults. This paper uses deep learning neural network classification models to determine if there are neuroanatomical changes in the brains of children with ADHD that are also observed for adult ADHD, and vice versa. We found that structural MRI data can significantly separate ADHD from control participants for both children and adults. Consistent with the prior reports from ENIGMA-ADHD, prediction performance and effect sizes were better for the child than the adult samples. The model trained on adult samples significantly predicted ADHD in the child sample, suggesting that our model learned anatomical features that common to ADHD in childhood and adulthood. These results support the continuity of ADHDs pathophysiology from childhood to adulthood. In addition, our work demonstrates a novel use of neural network classification models to test hypotheses about developmental continuity.",

    "abstract": "While sequencing ancient DNA from archaeological material is now commonplace, very few attempts to sequence ancient transcriptomes have been made, even from typically stable deposition environments such as permafrost. This is presumably due to assumptions that RNA completely degrades relatively quickly, particularly when dealing with autolytic, nuclease-rich mammalian tissues. However, given the recent successes in sequencing ancient RNA (aRNA) from various sources including plants and animals, we suspect that these assumptions may be incorrect or exaggerated. To challenge the underlying dogma, we generated shotgun RNA data from sources that might normally be dismissed for such study. Here we present aRNA data generated from two historical wolf skins, and permafrost-preserved liver tissue of a 14,300-year-old Pleistocene canid. Not only is the latter the oldest RNA ever to be sequenced, but also shows evidence of biologically relevant tissue-specificity and close similarity to equivalent data derived from modern-day control tissue. Other hallmarks of RNA-seq data such as exon-exon junction presence and high endogenous ribosomal RNA content confirms our datas authenticity. By performing independent technical replicates using two high-throughput sequencing platforms, we show not only that aRNA can survive for extended periods in mammalian tissues, but also that it has potential for tissue identification, and possibly further uses such as in vivo genome activity and adaptation, when sequenced using this technology.",

    "abstract": "AbstractInfluenza is an RNA virus with a genome comprised of eight gene segments. Recent experiments show that the vast majority of virions fail to express one or more gene segments and thus cannot cause a productive infection on their own. These particles, called semi-infectious particles (SIPs), can induce virion production through complementation when multiple SIPs are present in an infected cell. Previous within-host influenza models ignore the potential effects of coinfection and SIPs during virus infection. Here, to investigate the extent that SIPs and coinfection impact viral dynamics, we constructed two within-host models that explicitly keep track of SIPs and coinfection, and fitted the models to clinical data published previously. We found that the model making a more realistic assumption that viruses can only reach a limited number of target cells allows for frequent co-infection during early viral exponential growth and predicts that SIPs contribute substantially to viral load. Furthermore, the model provides a new interpretation of the determinants of viral growth and predicts that the virus within-host growth rate (a measure of viral fitness) is relatively insensitive to the fraction of virions being SIPs, consistent with biological observations. Our results highlight the important role that cellular co-infection can play in regulating infection dynamics and provide a potential explanation for why SIP production is not highly deleterious. More broadly, the model can be used as a general framework to understand coinfection/superinfection in other viral infections.\n\nAuthor SummaryInfluenza A viruses (IAVs) represent a large public health burden across the world. Currently, our understanding of their infection dynamics is incomplete, which hinders the development of effective vaccines and treatment strategies. Recently, it was shown that a large fraction of virions, called semi-infectious particles, do not cause productive infection on their own; however, coinfection of these particles leads to productive infection. The extent that semi-infectious particles and, more broadly, coinfection contribute to overall influenza infection dynamics is not clear. To address this question, we constructed mathematical models explicitly keeping track of semi-infectious particles and coinfection. We show that coinfection can be frequent over the course of infection and that SIPs play an important role in regulating infection dynamics. Our results have implications towards developing effective therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTranscranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is often targeted using a model of TMS-induced electric field (E). In such navigated TMS, the E-field models have been based on spherical approximation of the head. Such models omit the effects of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on the E-field, leading to potentially large errors in the computed field. So far, realistic models have been too slow for interactive TMS navigation.\n\nObjectiveWe present computational methods that enable real-time solving of the E-field in a realistic head model that contains the CSF.\n\nMethodsUsing reciprocity and Geselowitz integral equation, we separate the computations to coil-dependent and -independent parts. For the coil-dependent part of Geselowitz integrals, we present a fast numerical quadrature. Further, we present a moment-matching approach for optimizing dipole-based coil models. We verify the new methods using simulations in a realistic head model that contains the brain, CSF, skull, and scalp.\n\nResultsThe new quadrature introduces a relative error of 1.1%. The total error of the quadrature and coil model was 1.43% and 1.15% for coils with 38 and 76 dipoles, respectively. The difference between our head model and a simpler realistic model that omits the CSF was 29%. Using a standard PC and a 38-dipole coil, our solver computed the E-field in 84 coil positions per second in 20000 points on the cortex.\n\nConclusionThe presented methods enable real-time solving of the TMS-induced E-field in a realistic head model that contains the CSF. The new methodology allows more accurate targeting and precise adjustment of intensity during experimental or clinical TMS mapping.",

    "abstract": "Tendons hierarchical structure allows for load transfer between its fibrillar elements at multiple length scales. Tendon microstructure is particularly important, because it includes the cells and their surrounding collagen fibrils, where mechanical interactions can have potentially important physiological and pathological contributions. However, the three-dimensional microstructure and the mechanisms of load transfer in that length scale are not known. It has been postulated that interfibrillar matrix shear or direct load transfer via the fusion/branching of small fibrils are responsible for load transfer, but the significance of these mechanisms is still unclear. Alternatively, the helical fibrils that occur at the microstructural scale in tendon may also mediate load transfer, however, these structures are not well studied due to the lack of a three-dimensional visualization of tendon microstructure. In this study, we used serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) to investigate the threedimensional microstructure of fibrils in rat tail tendon. We found that tendon fibrils have a complex architecture with many helically wrapped fibrils. We studied the mechanical implications of these helical structures using finite element modeling and found that frictional contact between helical fibrils can induce load transfer even in the absence of matrix bonding or fibril fusion/branching. This study is significant in that it provides a three-dimensional view of the tendon microstructure and suggests friction between helically wrapped fibrils as a mechanism for load transfer, which is an important aspect of tendon biomechanics.",

    "abstract": "Molecular dynamics (or MD) simulations can be a powerful tool for modeling complex dissociative processes such as ligand unbinding. However, many biologically relevant dissociative processes occur on timescales that far exceed the timescales of typical MD simulations. Here, we implement and apply an enhanced sampling method in which specific energy terms in the potential energy function are selectively \"scaled\" to accelerate dissociative events during simulations. Using ligand unbinding as an example of a complex dissociative process, we selectively scaled-up ligand-water interactions in an attempt to increase the rate of ligand unbinding. By applying our selectively scaled MD (or ssMD) approach to three cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2)-inhibitor complexes, we were able to significantly accelerate ligand unbinding thereby allowing, in some cases, unbinding events to occur within as little as 2 ns. Moreover, we found that we could make realistic estimates of the unbinding [Formula] as well as the binding free energies ({triangleup}Gsim) of the three inhibitors from our ssMD simulation data. To accomplish this, we employed a previously described Kramers-based rate extrapolation (KRE) method and a newly described free energy extrapolation (FEE) method. Because our ssMD approach is general, it should find utility as an easy-to-deploy, enhanced sampling method for modeling other dissociative processes.",

Rod-shaped fission yeast cells divide at a threshold size partly due to Cdr2 kinase, which forms nodes at the medial cell cortex where it inhibits the Cdk1-inhibitor Wee1. Pom1 kinase phosphorylates and inhibits Cdr2, and forms cortical concentration gradients from cell poles. Pom1 inhibits Cdr2 signaling to Wee1 specifically in small cells, but the time and place of their regulatory interactions were unclear. We show that Pom1 forms stable oligomeric puncta that dynamically sample the cell cortex. Binding frequency is patterned into a concentration gradient by the polarity landmarks Tea1 and Tea4. Pom1 puncta colocalize with Cdr2 nodes, forming a glucose-modulated inhibitory threshold against node activation. Our work reveals how Pom1-Cdr2-Wee1 operates in multiprotein clusters at the cell cortex to promote mitotic entry at a specific size that can be modified by nutrient availability.",

    "abstract": "Membrane proteins like ion channels are located within a lipid environment. While the bulk lipids provide a supporting architecture for proteins, some lipids also play important signaling roles in modulating protein activity. This modulation can occur through direct interaction with proteins without involving second messenger pathways. Phosphoinositides are one such lipids, which have been implicated in interactions with a diverse range of proteins and such interactions mediate a variety of cellular functions. Towards understanding how these lipids play their roles in regulating protein functions It is necessary to detect interactions between proteins and lipids and to identify binding sites on proteins. However, detection of protein-lipid interactions has been difficult especially in their native environment because only a fraction of lipids are bound to proteins while the bulk is freely diffusing. The purpose of this study is to develop an experimental method capable of identifying protein-lipid interactions in membrane environments. The strategy involves luminescence energy transfer to locally illuminate lipids around proteins thereby suppressing the large background of light from unbound lipid molecules. The approach is applied to an inward rectifier potassium ion channel for its interactions with phosphoinositide lipids. Experiments show that it can successfully detect phosphoinositides bound to proteins, and when combined with mutagenic approaches, can further identify binding site. The approach thus provides a valuable methodology for probing protein-lipid interactions in a native-like lipid environment.",

    "abstract": "In three-dimensional light microscopy, the heterogeneity of the optical density in a specimen ultimately limits the achievable penetration depth and hence the three-dimensional resolution. The most direct approach to reduce aberrations, improve the contrast, and achieve an optimal resolution is minimizing the impact of changes of the refractive index along an optical path. Many light sheet fluorescence microscopes operate with a large chamber that contains an aqueous immersion medium and an inner specimen holder that contains the specimen embedded in a possibly entirely different non-aqueous medium. In order to minimize the impact of the specimen holder on the optical quality, we use multi-facetted cuvettes fabricated with vacuum-formed ultra-thin fluorocarbon (FEP) foils The ultra-thin FEP-foil cuvettes have a wall thickness of about 12 {micro}m. They are resilient to fluidic exchanges, durable, mechanically stable and yet flexible.\n\nWe confirm the improved imaging performance of ultra-thin FEP-foil cuvettes with excellent quality images of whole organs, thick tissue sections and dense organoid clusters. The cuvettes outperform many other sample-mounting techniques in terms of full separation of the specimen from the immersion medium, compatibility with aqueous and organic clearing media, quick specimen mounting without hydrogel embedding, as well as their applicability for multiple-view imaging and automated segmentation. Additionally, we show that ultra-thin FEP foil cuvettes are suitable for seeding and growing organoids over a time period of at least ten days. The ultra-thin cuvettes allow the fixation and staining of the specimens inside the holder, preserving the delicate morphology of e.g. fragile, mono-layered three-dimensional organoids.",

    "abstract": "Axonal growth cones are guided by molecular cues in the extracellular environment. The mechanisms of combinatorial integration of guidance signals at the growth cone cell membrane are still being unravelled. Limb-innervating axons of vertebrate spinal lateral motor column (LMC) neurons are attracted to netrin-1 via its receptor, Neogenin, and are repelled from ephrin-A5 through its receptor EphA4. The presence of both cues elicits synergistic guidance of LMC axons, but the mechanism of this effect remains unknown. Using fluorescence immunohistochemistry, we show that ephrin-A5 increases LMC growth cone Neogenin protein levels and netrin-1 binding. This effect is enhanced by overexpressing EphA4 and is inhibited by blocking ephrin-A5-EphA4 binding. These effects have a functional consequence on LMC growth cone responses since bath addition of ephrin-A5 increases the responsiveness of LMC axons to netrin-1. Surprisingly, the overexpression of EphA4 lacking its cytoplasmic tail, also enhances Neogenin levels at the growth cone and potentiates LMC axon preference for growth on netrin-1. Since netrins and ephrins participate in a wide variety of biological processes, the enhancement of netrin-1 signalling by ephrins may have broad implications.",

    "abstract": "Humans routinely face novel environments in which they have to generalize in order toact adaptively. However, doing so involves the non-trivial challenge of deciding which aspects of a task domain to generalize. While it is sometimes appropriate to simply re-use a learned behavior, often adaptive generalization entails recombining distinct components of knowledge acquired across multiple contexts. Theoretical work has suggested a computational trade-off in which it can be more or less useful to learn and generalize aspects of task structure jointly or compositionally, depending on previous task statistics, but empirical studies are lacking. Here we develop a series of navigation tasks which manipulate the statistics of goal values (\"what to do\") and state transitions (\"how to do it\") across contexts, and assess whether human subjects generalize these task components separately or conjunctively. We find that human generalization is sensitive to the statistics of the previously experienced task domain, favoring compositional or conjunctive generalization when the task statistics are indicative of such structures, and a mixture of the two when they are more ambiguous. These results support the predictions of a normative \"meta-generalization learning\" agent that does not only generalize previous knowledge but also generalizes the statistical structure most likely to support generalization.\n\nAuthor NoteThis work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation Proposal 1460604 \"How Prefrontal Cortex Augments Reinforcement Learning\" to MJF.

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) are ubiquitous components of eukaryotic genomes and can create variation in genomic organization. The majority of maize genomes are composed of TEs. We developed an approach to define shared and variable TE insertions across genome assemblies and applied this method to four maize genomes (B73, W22, Mo17, and PH207). Among these genomes we identified 1.6 Gb of variable TE sequence representing a combination of recent TE movement and deletion of previously existing TEs. Although recent TE movement only accounted for a portion of the TE variability, we identified 4,737 TEs unique to one genome with defined insertion sites in all other genomes. Variable TEs are found for all superfamilies and are distributed across the genome, including in regions of recent shared ancestry among individuals. There are 2,380 genes annotated in the B73 genome located within variable TEs, providing evidence for the role of TEs in contributing to the substantial differences in gene content among these genotypes. The large scope of TE variation present in this limited sample of temperate maize genomes highlights the major contribution of TEs in driving variation in genome organization and gene content.\n\nSignificance StatementThe majority of the maize genome is comprised of transposable elements (TEs) that have the potential to create genomic variation within species. We developed a method to identify shared and non-shared TEs using whole genome assemblies of four maize inbred lines. Variable TEs are found throughout the maize genome and in comparisons of any two genomes we find ~20% of the genome is due to non-shared TEs. Several thousand maize genes are found within TEs that are variable across lines, highlighting the contribution of TEs to gene content variation. This study creates a comprehensive resource for genomic studies of TE variability among four maize genomes, which will enable studies on the consequences of variable TEs on genome function.",

    "abstract": "Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal recessive disorder of excess iron absorption. The most common form, HH1, is caused by loss of function variants in HFE. HFE encodes a cell surface protein that binds to the Transferrin Receptor (TfR1), reducing TfR1s affinity for the transferrin/iron complex and thereby limiting cellular iron uptake. Two common missense alleles for HH1 have been identified, HFE C282Y and HFE H63D; H63D is considered to be a less penetrant allele. When we deployed Phenotype Risk Scores (PheRS), a method that aggregates multiple symptoms together in Electronic Health Records (EHRs), we identified HFE E168Q as a novel variant associated with HH. E168Q is on the same haplotype as H63D, and in a crystal structure HFE E168 lies at the interface of the HFE-TfR1 interaction and makes multiple salt bridge connections with TfR1. In in vitro cell surface abundance experiments, the HFE E168Q+H63D double mutation surprisingly increased cell surface abundance of HFE by 10-fold compared to wildtype. In coimmunoprecipitation experiments, however, HFE C282Y, E168Q, and E168Q+H63D completely abolished the interaction between HFE and TfR1, while H63D alone only partially reduced binding. These findings provide mechanistic insight to validate the PheRS result that HFE E168Q is an HH1-associated allele and lead to the reclassification of E168Q from a variant of uncertain significance to a pathogenic variant, according to ACMG guidelines. HFE E168Q results in loss of HFE function by disrupting the HFE-TfR1 interaction. In addition, some disease manifestations attributed to H63D may reflect the functional effects of E168Q.",

    "abstract": "One remarkable feature of the nervous system is its ability to rapidly and spontaneously switch between activity states. In the extreme example of sleep, animals arrest locomotion, reduce their sensitivity to sensory stimuli, and dramatically alter their neural activity. Small organisms are useful models to better understand these sudden changes in neural states because we can simultaneously observe whole-brain activity, monitor behavior and precisely regulate the external environment. Here, we show a spontaneous sleep-like behavior in C. elegans that is associated with a distinct global-brain state and regulated by both the animals internal physiological state and input from multiple sensory circuits. Specifically, we found that when confined in microfluidic chambers, adult worms spontaneously transition between periods of normal activity and short quiescent bouts, with behavioral state transitions occurring every few minutes. This quiescent state, which we call Sleep, meets the behavioral requirements of C. elegans sleep, is dependent on known sleep-promoting neurons ALA and RIS, and is associated with a global down-regulation of neural activity. Consistent with prior studies of C. elegans sleep, we found that Sleep is regulated by satiety and temperature. In addition, we show for the first time that quiescence can be either driven or suppressed by thermosensory input, and that animal restraint induces quiescence through mechanosensory pathways. Together, these results establish a rich model system for studying how neural and behavioral state transitions are influenced by multiple physiological and environmental conditions.\n\nSignificance StatementUnique brain states govern animal behaviors like sleep and wakefulness; however, how the brain regulates these dramatic state transitions is not well understood. Brain activity can be influenced by a complex interaction between sensory circuits that monitor the external environment, neural circuits that control behavior, and internal chemical signaling. Here, we describe a platform to study behavioral states in a context that allows us to record whole-brain activity while controlling the environment and monitoring animal behavior. Specifically, we identify a pattern of sleep bouts in the roundworm C. elegans that occur when they are confined to microscopic fluidic chambers. This behavior platform provides a powerful system to study how neural circuits interact with chemical signaling to drive brain state transitions.",

    "abstract": "Endurance exercise begun with reduced muscle glycogen stores seems to potentiate skeletal muscle protein abundance and gene expression. However, it is unknown whether this greater signalling responses is due to low muscle glycogen per se or to performing two exercise sessions in close proximity - as a first exercise session is necessary to reduce the muscle glycogen stores. In the present study, we manipulated the recovery duration between a first muscle glycogen-depleting exercise and a second exercise session, such that the second exercise session started with reduced muscle glycogen in both approaches but was performed either two or 15 h after the first exercise session (so-called \"twice-a-day\" and \"once-daily\" approaches, respectively). We found that exercise twice-a-day increased the nuclear abundance of transcription factor EB (TFEB) and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and potentiated the transcription of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta/delta (PPAR{beta}/{delta}) genes, in comparison with the once-daily exercise. These results suggest that the elevated molecular signalling reported with previous \"train-low\" approaches can be attributed to performing two exercise sessions in close proximity rather than the reduced muscle glycogen content per se. The twice-a-day approach might be an effective strategy to induce adaptations related to mitochondrial biogenesis and fat oxidation.",

    "abstract": "Background/AimsLitter size is one of the most important reproductive traits in pig breeding, which is affected by multiple genes and the environment. Ovaries are the most important reproductive organs and have a profound impact on the reproduction efficiency. Therefore, genetic differences in the ovaries may contribute to the observed differences in litter size. Although QTLs and candidate genes have been reported to affect the litter size in many pig breeds, however, the findings cannot elucidate the marked differences of the reproductive traits between breeds. The aim of present work is to elucidate the mechanisms of the differences for the reproductive traits and identify candidate genes associated with litter size in Xiang pig breed.\n\nMethodsThe changes in ovary transcriptome and alternative splicing were investigated at estrus between Xiang pigs with large and small litter size by RNA-seq technology. The RNA-seq results were confirmed by RT-qPCR method.\n\nResultsWe detected 16,219 - 16,285 expressed genes and 12 types of alternative splicing (AS) events in Xiang pig samples. A total of 762 differentially expressed genes were identified by XL (Xiang pig group with larger litter size) vs XS (Xiang pig group with small litter size) sample comparisons. A total of 34 genes were upregulated and 728 genes were downregulated in XL ovary samples compared with the XS samples. Alternative splicing (AS) rates in XL samples were slightly lower than that observed in XS samples. Most of differentially expressed genes were differentially regulated on AS level. Eleven candidate genes were potentially identified to be related to Xiang pig fecundity and litter size, which may be closely related to the gonad development, oocyte maturation or embryo quality.\n\nConclusionThe significant changes in the expression of the protein-coding genes and the level of alternative splicing in estrus ovarian transcriptome between XL and XS groups probably are the molecular mechanisms of phenotypic variation in litter size.",

We have analysed changes in the architecture of the Escherichia coli SMC complex, MukBEF, as a function of nucleotide binding to MukB and subsequent ATP hydrolysis. This builds upon previous work showing that MukF kleisin directs formation of a MukBEF tripartite ring as a consequence of functional interactions between the C- and N-terminal domains of MukF with the MukB head and neck, respectively (Zawadzka et al., 2018). Using both model truncated substrates and complexes containing full length MukB, we now demonstrate formation of MukBEF  dimers of dimers, dependent on MukF dimerization, MukB head-engagement and MukE, which plays an essential role in organizing MukBEF complexes.",

    "abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest class of integral membrane proteins and represent key targets for pharmacological research. GPCRs modulate cell physiology by engaging and activating a diversity of intracellular transducers, prominently heterotrimeric G proteins, but also G protein-receptor kinases (GRKs) and arrestins. The recent surge in the number of structures of GPCR-G protein complexes has expanded our understanding of G protein recognition and GPCR-mediated signal transduction. However, many aspects of these mechanisms, including the existence of transient interactions with transducers, have remained elusive.\n\nHere, we present the cryo-EM structure of the light-sensitive GPCR rhodopsin in complex with heterotrimeric Gi. In contrast to all reported structures, our density map reveals the receptor C-terminal tail bound to the G{beta} subunit of the G protein heterotrimer. This observation provides a structural foundation for the role of the C-terminal tail in GPCR signaling, and of G{beta} as scaffold for recruiting G subunits and GRKs. By comparing all available complex structures, we found a small set of common anchoring points that are G protein-subtype specific. Taken together, our structure and analysis provide new structural basis for the molecular events of the GPCR signaling pathway.",

Cooperation among these fundamental cellular components can occur through highly structured interactions connecting domains formed by specific sequences of nucleotides, ribonucleotides, and/or amino acids and also through the assembly of biomolecular condensates. Here, we show that endoderm differentiation is regulated through the interaction of the long noncoding (lnc) RNA DIGIT and the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) domain family protein BRD3. BRD3 forms phase-separated condensates that contain DIGIT, occupies enhancers of endoderm transcription factors, and is required for endoderm differentiation. Purified BRD3 binds to acetylated histone H3 lysine 18 (H3K18ac) in vitro and occupies regions of the genome enriched in H3K18ac during endoderm differentiation, including the key transcription factors that regulate endoderm differentiation. DIGIT is also enriched in regions of H3K18ac, and depletion of DIGIT results in decreased recruitment of BRD3 to these regions. Our findings support a model where cooperation between DIGIT and BRD3 at regions of H3K18ac regulates the transcription factors that drive endoderm differentiation and suggest a broader role for protein-lncRNA phase-separated condensates as regulators of transcription in development.",

Despite numerous correlations of behavioural and nervous system divergence, demonstration of the genetic basis of interspecific behavioural differences remains rare. Here we develop a novel neurogenetic model, Drosophila sechellia, a close cousin of D. melanogaster that displays profound behavioural changes linked to its extreme host fruit specialisation. Through calcium imaging, we identify olfactory pathways detecting host volatiles. Mutational analysis indicates roles for individual receptors in long- and short-range attraction. Cross-species allele transfer demonstrates that differential tuning of one receptor is important for species-specific behaviour. We identify the molecular determinants of this functional change, and characterise their behavioural significance and evolutionary origin. Circuit tracing reveals that receptor adaptations are accompanied by increased sensory pooling onto interneurons and novel central projection patterns. This work links molecular and neuronal changes to behavioural divergence and defines a powerful model for investigating nervous system evolution and speciation.",

Consequently, developmental gene regulatory networks (GRNs) must faithfully adjust their dynamics to a variable time scale. We find evidence that layered weak repression of genes provides the necessary coupling between GRN output and cellular metabolism. Using a mathematical model that replicates such a scenario, we find that lowering metabolism corrects developmental errors that otherwise occur when different layers of repression are lost. Through mutant analysis, we show that gene expression dynamics are unaffected by loss of repressors, but only when cellular metabolism is reduced. We further show that when metabolism is lowered, formation of a variety of sensory organs in Drosophila is normal despite loss of individual repressors of transcription, mRNA stability, and protein stability. We demonstrate the universality of this phenomenon by experimentally eliminating the entire microRNA family of repressors, and find that all microRNAs are rendered unnecessary when metabolism is reduced. Thus, layered weak repression provides robustness through error frequency suppression, and may provide an evolutionary route to a shorter reproductive cycle.",

    "abstract": "There are many enzymes that are relevant for making rare and valuable chemicals that while active, are severely limited by thermodynamic, kinetic, or stability issues (e.g. isomerases, lyases, transglycosidase etc.). In this work, we study an enzymatic reaction system - Lactobacillus sakei L-arabinose isomerase (LsLAI) for D-galactose to D-tagatose isomerization - that is limited by all three reaction parameters. The enzyme has a low catalytic efficiency for non-natural substrate galactose, has low thermal stability at temperatures > 40 {degrees}C, and equilibrium conversion < 50%. After exploring several strategies to overcome these limitations, we finally show that encapsulating the enzyme in a gram-positive bacterium (Lactobacillus plantarum) that is chemically permeabilized can enable reactions at high rates, high conversion, and at high temperatures. The modified whole cell system stabilizes the enzyme, differentially partitions substrate and product across the membrane to shift the equilibrium toward product formation enables rapid transport of substrate and product for fast kinetics. In a batch process, this system enables approximately 50 % conversion in 4 h starting with 300 mM galactose (an average productivity of 37 mM/h), and 85 % conversion in 48 h, which are the highest reported for food-safe mesophilic tagatose synthesis. We suggest that such an approach may be invaluable for other enzymatic processes that are similarly kinetically-, thermodynamically-, and/or stability-limited.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIt is becoming clear that tumor immune T cell infiltration and its functional orientation have substantial effect on cancer progression, influencing both response to therapy and prognosis. In this pan-cancer study, the previously described Immunologic Constant of Rejection (ICR) signature is used to define opposing immune phenotypes (i.e., immuneactive and immune-silent) across 31 different histologies. We systematically analyze the interconnections between the genetic programming of neoplasms and their immune orientation across different histologies, and the prognostic impact of such interplay. Moreover, we investigated the predictive value of ICR classification across various public datasets of immune checkpoint inhibition therapy.\n\nMethodsRNA-seq data of samples from a total of 9,282 patient tumor samples representing 31 cancer types were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We classified each cancer type based on the expression of the ICR gene signature. Oncogenic pathway gene set enrichment and mutational status were analyzed in relation to ICR phenotypes. To explore whether tumorintrinsic attributes associate with the prognostic value of ICR across cancers, we compared mutational load, oncogenic alterations and expression of oncogenic pathways between cancer types using an integrative bioinformatic pipeline.\n\nResultsOur analyses identified a distinct prognostic connotation of ICR depending on cancer histology. We identified several oncogenic pathways whose enrichment inversely correlated with ICR in multiple tumor types. We found several cancer specific pathways that were differentially enriched between tumors in which ICR had a prognostic impact versus the ones in which ICR did not bear any prognostic connotation such as proliferation and TGF-beta signaling. Importantly, this conditional impact of ICR was also validated in the context of immune checkpoint inhibition treatment.\n\nConclusionsWe identified tumor-intrinsic attributes that correlate with immune phenotypes and potentially influence their development. In addition, a relationship was observed between the enrichment of oncogenic pathways and the prognostic significance of the ICR and its predictive value for patients treated with anti-CTLA4 immune checkpoint inhibition. Such information can be used to prioritize potential candidates for therapies aimed at converting immune-silent into immuneactive tumors and to refine stratification algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Natural Killer (NK) cells can develop memory-like features and contribute to long-term immunity in mice and humans. NK cells are critical for protection against acute T. gondii infection. However, whether they contribute to long-term immunity in response to this parasite is unknown. We used a vaccine challenge model of parasite infection to address this question and to define the mechanism by which NK cells are activated during secondary parasite infection. We found NK cells were required for control of secondary infection. NK cells increased in number at the infection site, became cytotoxic and produced IFN{gamma}. Adoptive transfer and NK-cell fate mapping revealed that T. gondii-experienced NK cells were not intrinsically different from naive NK cells with respect to their long-term persistence and ability to protect. Thus, they did not develop memory-like characteristics. Instead, a cell-extrinsic mechanism may control protective NK-cell responses during secondary infection. To test the involvement of a cell-extrinsic mechanism, we used anti-IL-12p70 and IL-12p35-/- mice and found that the secondary NK-cell response was not fully dependent on IL-12. IL-23 depletion with anti-IL-23p19 in vivo significantly reduced the secondary NK-cell response, suggesting that both IL-12 and IL-23 were involved. Anti-IL-12p40 treatment, which blocks both IL-12 and IL-23, eliminated the protective secondary NK-cell response, supporting this hypothesis. Our results define a previously unknown protective role for NK cells during secondary T. gondii infection that is dependent on IL-12 and IL-23.",

    "abstract": "Choosing good objects is essential for real life, which is controlled mainly by the basal ganglia. For that, a subject need to not only find good objects, but  reject bad objects. To reveal this  rejection mechanism, we created a sequential saccade choice task for monkeys and studied the indirect pathway of caudate tail mediated by cvGPe (caudal-ventral globus pallidus externus). The inhibitory responses of cvGPe neurons to bad objects were smaller when the monkey made saccades to them by mistake. Moreover, experimental reduction of the inhibitory response by local injection of bicuculline (GABAA antagonist) disabled the monkey to reject bad objects. In conclusion, rejecting bad objects is crucial for goal-directed behavior, which is controlled by the indirect pathway in the basal ganglia.",

    "abstract": "Natural sounds have broadband modulation spectra and contain acoustic dynamics ranging from tens to hundreds of milliseconds. How does the human auditory system encode acoustic information over wide-ranging timescales to achieve sound recognition? Previous work (Teng et al., 2017) demonstrated a temporal coding preference in the auditory system for the theta (4 - 7 Hz) and gamma (30 - 45 Hz) ranges, but it remains unclear how acoustic dynamics between these two ranges is encoded. Here we generated artificial sounds with temporal structures over timescales from ~200 ms to ~30 ms and investigated temporal coding on different timescales in the human auditory cortex. Participants discriminated sounds with temporal structures at different timescales while undergoing magnetoencephalography (MEG) recording. The data show robust neural entrainment in the theta and the gamma bands, but not in the alpha and beta bands. Classification analyses as well as stimulus reconstruction reveal that the acoustic information of all timescales can be differentiated through the theta and gamma bands, but the acoustic dynamics in the theta and gamma ranges are preferentially encoded. We replicate earlier findings of multi-time scale processing and further demonstrate that the theta and gamma bands show generality of temporal coding across all timescales with comparable capacity. The results support the hypothesis that the human auditory cortex primarily encodes auditory information employing neural processes within two discrete temporal regimes.\n\nSignificanceNatural sounds contain rich acoustic dynamics over wide-ranging timescales, but perceptually relevant regularities often occupy specific temporal ranges. For instance, speech carries phonemic information on a shorter timescale than syllabic information at ~ 200 ms. How does the brain efficiently  sample continuous acoustic input to perceive temporally structured sounds? We presented sounds with temporal structures at different timescales and measured cortical entrainment using magnetoencephalography. We found, unexpectedly, that the human auditory system preserves high temporal coding precision on two non-overlapping timescales, the slower (theta) and faster (gamma) bands, to track acoustic dynamics over all timescales. The results suggest that the acoustic environment which we experience as seamless and continuous is segregated by discontinuous neural processing, or  sampled.",

    "abstract": "Successful consolidation of associative memories relies on the coordinated interplay of slow oscillations and sleep spindles during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, enabling the transfer of labile information from the hippocampus to permanent memory stores in the neocortex. During senescence, the decline of the structural and functional integrity of the hippocampus and neocortical regions is paralleled by changes of the physiological events that stabilize and enhance associative memories during NREM sleep. However, the currently available evidence is inconclusive if and under which circumstances aging impacts memory consolidation. By tracing the encoding quality of single memories in individual participants, we demonstrate that previous learning determines the extent of age-related impairments in memory consolidation. Specifically, the detrimental effects of aging on memory maintenance were greatest for mnemonic contents of medium encoding quality, whereas memory gain of weakly encoded memories did not differ by age. Using multivariate techniques, we identified profiles of alterations in sleep physiology and brain structure characteristic for increasing age. Importantly, while both  aged sleep and  aged brain structure profiles were associated with reduced memory maintenance, inter-individual differences in neither sleep nor structural brain integrity qualified as the driving force behind age differences in sleep-dependent consolidation in the present study.",

    "abstract": "Cells respond to changes in environmental conditions by activating signal transduction pathways and gene expression programs. Here we present a dataset to explore the relationship between environmental stresses, kinases, and global gene expression in yeast. We subjected 28 drug-sensitive kinase mutants to 10 environmental conditions in the presence of inhibitor and performed mRNA deep sequencing. With these data, we reconstructed canonical stress pathways and identified examples of crosstalk among pathways. The data also implicated numerous kinases in novel environment-specific roles. However, rather than regulating dedicated sets of target genes, individual kinases tuned the magnitude of induction of the environmental stress response (ESR) - a gene expression signature shared across the set of perturbations - in environment-specific ways. This suggests that the ESR integrates inputs from multiple sensory kinases to modulate gene expression and growth control. As an example, we provide experimental evidence that the high osmolarity glycerol pathway is a constitutive negative regulator of protein kinase A, a known inhibitor of the ESR. These results elaborate the central axis of cellular stress response signaling.",

    "abstract": "Adolescence is often filled with positive and negative emotional experiences that may change how individuals remember and respond to stimuli in their environment. In adults, aversive events can both enhance memory for associated stimuli as well as generalize to enhance memory for unreinforced but conceptually related stimuli. The present study tested whether learned aversive associations similarly lead to better memory and generalization across a category of stimuli in adolescents. Participants completed an olfactory Pavlovian category conditioning task in which trial-unique exemplars from one of two categories were partially reinforced with an aversive odor. Participants then returned 24-hours later to complete a surprise recognition memory test. We found better corrected recognition memory for the reinforced versus the unreinforced category of stimuli in both adults and adolescents. Further analysis revealed that enhanced recognition memory was driven specifically by better memory for the reinforced exemplars. Autonomic arousal during learning was also related to subsequent memory. These findings build on previous work in adolescent and adult humans and rodents showing comparable acquisition of aversive Pavlovian conditioned responses across age groups and demonstrate that memory for stimuli with an acquired aversive association is enhanced in both adults and adolescents.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in data acquiring technologies in biology have led to major challenges in mining relevant information from large datasets. For example, single-cell RNA sequencing technologies are producing expression and sequence information from tens of thousands of cells in every single experiment. A common task in analyzing biological data is to cluster samples or features (e.g. genes) into groups sharing common characteristics. This is an NP-hard problem for which numerous heuristic algorithms have been developed. However, in many cases, the clusters created by these algorithms do not reflect biological reality. To overcome this, a Networks Based Clustering (NBC) approach was recently proposed, by which the samples or genes in the dataset are first mapped to a network and then community detection (CD) algorithms are used to identify clusters of nodes.\n\nHere, we created an open and flexible python-based toolkit for NBC that enables easy and accessible network construction and community detection. We then tested the applicability of NBC for identifying clusters of cells or genes from previously published large-scale single-cell and bulk RNA-seq datasets.\n\nWe show that NBC can be used to accurately and efficiently analyze large-scale datasets of RNA sequencing experiments.",

    "abstract": "TThere is evidence that humans rely on an earth gravity (9.81 m/s2) prior for a series of tasks involving perception and action, the reason being that gravity helps predict future positions of moving objects. Eye-movements in turn are partially guided by predictions about observed motion. Thus, the question arises whether knowledge about gravity is also used to guide eye-movements: If humans rely on a representation of earth gravity for the control of eye movements, earth-gravity-congruent motion should lead to improved visual pursuit. In a pre-registered experiment, we presented participants (n=10) with parabolic motion governed by six different gravities (-1/0.7/0.85/1/1.15/1.3g), two initial vertical velocities and two initial horizontal velocities in a 3D environment. Participants were instructed to follow the target with their eyes. We tracked their gaze and computed the visual gain (velocity of the eyes divided by velocity of the target) as proxy for the quality of pursuit. An LMM analysis with gravity condition as fixed effect and intercepts varying per subject showed that the gain was lower for -1g than for 1g (by -0.13, SE = 0.005). This model was significantly better than a null model without gravity as fixed effect (p<0.001), supporting our hypothesis. A comparison of 1g and the remaining gravity conditions revealed that 1.15g (by 0.043, SE=0.005) and 1.3g (by 0.065, SE=0.005) were associated with lower gains, while 0.7g (by 0.054, SE=0.005) and 0.85g (by 0.029, SE=0.005) were associated with higher gains. This model was again significantly better than a null model (p<0.001), contradicting our hypothesis. Post-hoc analyses reveal that confounds in the 0.7/0.85/1/1.15/1.3g condition may be responsible for these contradicting results. Despite these discrepancies, our data thus provide some support for the hypothesis that internalized knowledge about earth gravity guides eye movements.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive and incurable motor neuron disease. Some ALS patients are affected by a level of cognitive or behavioural decline that meets the criteria for frontotemporal dementia (FTD). ALS and FTD share genetic and pathological features; for example, the deposition of phosphorylated 43 kDa TAR DNA-binding protein (pTDP-43) in the brain. Spreading of pTDP-43 pathology in ALS towards brain areas that connect via the Papez circuit is a possible indicator of progression towards FTD. For example, pTDP-43 aggregates in the granule cells of the hippocampus correlate well with clinically manifest FTD. Here, we test the hypothesis that white matter degeneration of the perforant path - as part of the Papez circuit - in the hippocampus is a feature of ALS, even in the absence of fully developed FTD or deposition of pTDP-43 inclusions in hippocampal granule cells. We used diffusion MRI (dMRI), polarized light imaging (PLI) and immunohistochemical analysis of hippocampus sections from controls (n=5) and ALS patients (n=14) to perform an in-depth study of white matter in the perforant path.\n\nThe dMRI results show a significant decrease in fractional anisotropy (p=0.01) and an increase in mean diffusivity (p=0.01), axial diffusivity (p=0.03) and radial diffusivity (p=0.03) in the perforant path in ALS patients compared to controls, possibly indicating a loss of white matter fibres. Myelin density (measured with PLI retardance) was lower in ALS patients compared to controls (p=0.05) and correlated with dMRI fractional anisotropy (r=0.52, p=0.03). The dMRI and PLI results were confirmed by the immunohistochemistry; both myelin (proteolipid protein, p=0.03) and neurofilaments (SMI-312, p=0.02) were lower in ALS patients. The activated microglial (CD68) density was similar in ALS and controls. Only two out of the fourteen ALS cases showed pTDP-43 pathology in the dentate gyrus; however, while these two ALS-FTD cases showed reduced myelination in the perforant path, the values were comparable to other ALS cases.\n\nWe conclude that degeneration of the perforant path occurs in ALS patients and that this may occur before, or independent of, pTDP-43 aggregation in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Future research should focus on correlating the degree of clinically observed cognitive decline to the amount of white matter atrophy in the perforant path.",

As regulatory interactions can typically not be directly observed experimentally, various computational methods have been proposed to disentangling direct and indirect effects. Most of these rely on assumptions that are rarely met or cannot be adapted to a given context.\n\nResultsWe present a network inference method that is based on a simple response logic with minimal presumptions. It requires that we can experimentally observe whether or not some of the systems components respond to perturbations of some other components, and then identifies the directed networks that most accurately account for the observed propagation of the signal. To cope with the intractable number of possible networks, we developed a logic programming approach that can infer networks of hundreds of nodes, while being robust to noisy, heterogeneous or missing data. This allows to directly integrate prior network knowledge and additional constraints such as sparsity. We systematically benchmark our method on KEGG pathways, and show that it outperforms existing approaches in DREAM3 and DREAM4-challenges. Applied to a perturbation data set on PI3K and MAPK pathways in isogenic models of a colon cancer cell line, it generates plausible network hypotheses that explain distinct sensitivities towards EGFR inhibitors by different PI3K mutants.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationA Python/Answer Set Programming implementation can be accessed at github.com/GrossTor/response-logic.\n\nContactnils.bluethgen@charite.de",

Posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD), associated with ZEB1 insufficiency, provides a new biological context in which to understand and evaluate the classic EMT/MET paradigm. PPCD is characterized by a cadherin-switch and transition to an epithelial-like transcriptomic and cellular phenotype, which we study in a cell-based model of PPCD generated using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated ZEB1 knockout in corneal endothelial cells (CEnCs). Transcriptomic and functional studies support the hypothesis that CEnC undergo a MET-like transition in PPCD, termed endothelial to epithelial transition (EnET), and lead to the conclusion that EnET may be considered a corollary to the classic EMT/MET paradigm.",

    "abstract": "The majority of oligodendrocytes in the neocortex originate from neural progenitors that reside in the dorsal forebrain. We recently showed that Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling in these dorsal progenitors is required to produce normal numbers of neocortical oligodendrocytes during embryonic development. Conditional deletion of the Shh signaling effector, Smo, in dorsal progenitors caused a dramatic reduction in oligodendrocyte numbers in the embryonic neocortex. In the current study, we show that the depleted oligodendrocyte lineage in Smo conditional mutants is able to recover to control numbers over time. This eventual recovery is achieved in part by expansion of the ventrally-derived wild-type lineage that normally makes up a minority of the total oligodendrocyte population. However, we find that the remaining dorsally-derived mutant cells also increase in numbers over time to contribute equally to the recovery of the total population. Additionally, we found that the ways in which the dorsal and ventral sources cooperate to achieve recovery is different for distinct subclasses of oligodendrocyte-lineage cells. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) in the neocortical white matter recover completely by expansion of the remaining dorsally-derived Smo mutant cells. On the other hand, mature oligodendrocytes in the white and gray matter recover through an equal contribution from dorsal mutant and ventral wild-type lineages. Interestingly, the only population that did not make a full recovery was OPCs in the gray matter. We find that gray matter OPCs are less proliferative in Smo cKO mutants compared to controls, which may explain their inability to fully recover. These studies shed light on the nature of competition and cooperation between dorsal and ventral sources of oligodendrocytes in the developing neocortex. Furthermore, our data point towards differential use of Shh signaling in the development of distinct subclasses of the oligodendrocyte lineage.",

    "abstract": "Lateral hypothalamus (LH) orexin neuron signaling has been implicated in the motivation to seek and take drugs of abuse. The number of LH orexin neurons has been shown to vary with behavioral state and can be upregulated with exposure to drugs of abuse. We sought to determine if the number of LH orexin neurons related to individual differences in motivation (demand) for cocaine in our behavioral economics (BE) paradigm, and whether knockdown of these cells predicted changes in economic demand. We quantified LH orexin cell numbers in animals immediately following our BE paradigm, as well as BE-experienced animals after a two-week period of abstinence to relate the number of LH orexin cells to economic demand for cocaine. We also unilaterally knocked down LH orexin expression prior to BE with an orexin morpholino antisense to determine how reduced orexin numbers impacted cocaine demand. Animals with greater motivation for cocaine (lower demand elasticity) had more LH orexin neurons. Following a two-week abstinence from BE, the number of LH orexin neurons predicted economic demand for cocaine prior to abstinence. Reducing LH orexin cell numbers with antisense decreased motivation for cocaine (increased demand elasticity) without affecting baseline consumption. In addition, the number of spared LH orexin neurons after antisense treatment correlated with individual demand for cocaine. These studies point to a role for the endogenous number of LH orexin neurons in individual differences in motivation for cocaine.",

    "abstract": "Functional neuronal correlations between pairs of neurons are thought to play an important role in neuronal information processing and optimal neuronal computations during attention, perception, decision-making and learning. Here, we report dynamic changes in prefrontal neuronal noise correlations at multiple time-scales, as a function of task contingencies. Specifically, we record neuronal activity from the macaque frontal eye fields, a cortical region at the source of spatial attention top-down control, while the animals are engaged in tasks of varying cognitive demands. First, we show that noise correlations decrease as cognitive engagement and task demands increase, both across tasks and within-trials. Second, we demonstrate, for the first time, rhythmic modulations of noise correlations in the alpha and beta frequency ranges that account both for overt behavioral performance and for layer specific modulations in spike-field coherence. All this taken together demonstrates a strong functional role of noise correlations in cognitive flexibility.",
