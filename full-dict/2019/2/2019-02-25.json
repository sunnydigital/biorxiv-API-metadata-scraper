    "abstract": "Mitochondria have long been implicated in Parkinsons disease (PD), however, it is not clear how mitochondrial impairment and alpha-synuclein pathology are coupled. We report here that intra-mitochondrial protein homeostasis plays a major role in alpha-synuclein fibril elongation, as interference with intra-mitochondrial proteases and mitochondrial protein import significantly aggravate alpha-synuclein aggregation. In contrast, direct inhibition of mitochondrial complex I, increase in intracellular calcium concentration or formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), all of which have been associated with mitochondrial stress, did not affect alpha-synuclein pathology. We further demonstrate that similar mechanisms are involved in Amyloid {beta} 1-42 (A{beta}42) aggregation, suggesting that mitochondria are directly capable of influencing cytosolic protein homeostasis of aggregation-prone proteins.",

    "abstract": "Vestibular balance control is dynamically weighted during locomotion. This might result from a selective suppression of vestibular inputs in favor of a feed-forward balance regulation based on locomotor efference copies. The feasibility of such a feed-forward mechanism should however critically depend on the predictability of head movements (PHM) during locomotion. To test this, we studied in healthy subjects the differential impact of a stochastic vestibular stimulation (SVS) on body sway (center-of-pressure, COP) during standing and walking at different speeds using time-frequency analyses and compared it to activity-dependent changes in PHM. SVS-COP coupling decreased from standing to walking and further dropped with faster locomotion. Correspondingly, PHM increased with faster locomotion. Furthermore, SVS-COP coupling depended on the gait-cycle-phase with peaks corresponding to periods of least PHM. These findings support the assumption that during stereotyped human self-motion, locomotor efference copies selectively replace vestibular cues, similar to what was previously observed in animal models.",

    "abstract": "Changes in the myocardial energetics associated with aging--reductions in creatine phosphate (CrP)/ATP ratio, total creatine, and ATP--mirror changes observed in failing hearts compared to healthy controls. Similarly, both aging and heart failure are associated with significant reductions in cardiac performance and maximal left ventricular cardiac power output (CPO) compared to young healthy individuals. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that reductions in the concentrations cytoplasmic adenine nucleotide, creatine, and phosphate pools that occur with aging impair the myocardial capacity to synthesize ATP at physiological free energy levels, and that the resulting changes to myocardial energetic status impair the mechanical pumping ability of the heart. The purpose of this study is to test theses hypotheses using an age-structured population model for myocardial metabolism in the adult female population and to determine the potential impact of reductions in key myocardial metabolite pools in causing metabolic/energetic and cardiac mechanical dysfunction associated with aging. To test these hypotheses, we developed a population model for myocardial energetics to predict myocardial ATP, ADP, CrP, creatine, and inorganic phosphate concentrations as functions of cardiac work and age in the adult female population. Model predictions support our hypotheses and are consistent with previous experimental observations. The major findings provide a novel theoretical and computational framework for further probing complex relationships between the energetics and performance of the heart with aging.\n\nSignificanceNormal mechanical function of the heart requires that ATP be continuously synthesized at a hydrolysis potential of roughly -60 kJ mol-1. Yet in both the aging and diseased heart the relationships between cardiac work rate and concentrations of ATP, ADP, and inorganic phosphate are altered. Important outstanding questions are: To what extent do changes in metabolite concentrations that occur in aging and heart disease affect metabolic/molecular processes in the myocardium? How are systolic and diastolic functions affected by changes in metabolite concentrations? This study addresses these questions by analyzing relationships between cardiac energy demand and supply using an age-structured population model for human myocardial energetics in women.",

    "abstract": "Seeds are involved in the vertical transmission of microorganisms in plants and act as reservoirs for the plant microbiome. They could serve as carriers of pathogens, making the study of microbial interactions on seeds important in the emergence of plant diseases. We studied the influence of biological disturbances caused by seed transmission of two phytopathogenic agents, Alternaria brassicicola Abra43 (Abra43) and Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris 8004 (Xcc8004), on the structure and function of radish seed microbial assemblages, as well as the nutritional overlap between Xcc8004 and the seed microbiome, to find seed microbial residents capable of outcompeting this pathogen. According to taxonomic and functional inference performed on metagenomics reads, no shift in structure and function of the seed microbiome was observed following Abra43 and Xcc8004 transmission. This lack of impact derives from a limited overlap in nutritional resources between Xcc8004 and the major bacterial populations of radish seeds. However, two native seed-associated bacterial strains belonging to Stenotrophomonas rhizophila displayed a high overlap with Xcc8004 regarding the use of resources; they might therefore limit its transmission. The strategy we used may serve as a foundation for the selection of seed indigenous bacterial strains that could limit seed transmission of pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Many cancer genomes are extensively rearranged with highly aberrant chromosomal karyotypes. These genome rearrangements, or structural variants, can be detected in tumor DNA sequencing data by abnormal mapping of se-quence reads to the reference genome. However, nearly all cancer sequencing to date is of bulk tumor samples which consist of a heterogeneous mixture of normal cells and subpopulations of cancers cells, or clones, that harbor distinct somatic structural variants. We introduce a novel algorithm, Reconstructing Cancer Karyotypes (RCK), to reconstruct haplotype-specific karyotypes of one or more rearranged cancer genomes, or clones, that best explain the read alignments from a bulk tumor sample. RCK leverages specific evolutionary constraints on the somatic mutation process in cancer to reduce ambiguity in the deconvolution of admixed DNA sequence data into multiple haplotype-specific cancer karyotypes. In particular, RCK relies on generalizations of the infinite sites assumption that a genome re-arrangement is highly unlikely to occur at the same nucleotide position more than once during somatic evolution. RCKs comprehensive model allows us to incorporate information both from short and long-read sequencing technologies and is applicable to bulk tumor samples containing a mixture of an arbitrary number of derived genomes. We compared RCK to the state-of-the-art method ReMixT on a dataset of 17 primary and metastatic prostate cancer samples. We demonstrate that ReMixTs limited support for heterogeneity and lack of evolutionary constrains leads to reconstruction of implausible karyotypes. In contrast, RCKs infers cancer karyotypes that better explain read alignments from bulk tumor samples and are consistent with a reasonable evolutionary model. RCKs reconstructions of clone- and haplotype-specific karyotypes will aid further studies of the role of intra-tumor heterogeneity in cancer development and response to treatment.

    "abstract": "Biotic interactions are hypothesized to be one of the main processes shaping trait and biogeographic evolution during lineage diversification. Theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that species with similar ecological requirements either spatially exclude each other, by preventing the colonization of competitors or by driving coexisting populations to extinction, or show niche divergence when in sympatry. However, the extent and generality of the effect of interspecific competition in trait and biogeographic evolution has been limited by a dearth of appropriate process-generating models to directly test the effect of biotic interactions. Here, we formulate a phylogenetic parametric model that allows interdependence between trait and biogeographic evolution, thus enabling a direct test of central hypotheses on how biotic interactions shape these evolutionary processes. We adopt a Bayesian data augmentation approach to estimate the joint posterior distribution of trait histories, range histories, and co-evolutionary process parameters under this analytically intractable model. Through simulations, we show that our model is capable of distinguishing alternative scenarios of biotic interactions. We apply our model to the radiation of Darwins finches--a classic example of adaptive divergence--and find support for in situ trait divergence in beak size, convergence in traits such as beak shape and tarsus length, and strong competitive exclusion throughout their evolutionary history. Our modeling framework opens new possibilities for testing more complex hypotheses about the processes underlying lineage diversification. More generally, it provides a robust probabilistic methodology to model correlated evolution of continuous and discrete characters.",

    "abstract": "Microsatellite sequences are widely assumed to evolve neutrally, but also play an important role in bacterial pathogenesis, human disease and transcript abundance. The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum genome is extraordinarily AT-rich, containing 132,449 microsatellites-stretches of perfect 1-9 bp repeats between 10-1000bp, which comprise 10.74% of the 23 Mb genome. This project was designed to determine the mode and tempo of microsatellite mutations in malaria parasites. We maintained 31 parasite lines derived from a single 3D7 parasite cell for 114-267 days, with frequent bottlenecking to a single cell to minimize effective population size, allowing us to measure mutations accumulated over ~13,207 mitotic divisions. We Illumina sequenced the genomes of both progenitor and end-point mutation accumulation (MA) parasite lines in duplicate to validate stringent calling parameters. Calls were 99.89% (GATK), 99.99% (freeBayes) and 99.96% (HipSTR) concordant in duplicate sequence runs from independent sequence libraries. We observed 98 microsatellite mutations, giving rates of 2.11 x 10-7 - 1.46 x 10-8 /cell division that were strongly influenced by repeat motif and array length. Mutation rate was low relative to other organisms. However, despite this, in a single infection (1011 parasites) there will be 1.46 x 103 - 2.11 x 104 independent mutations at any single microsatellite locus. Given that many microsatellites are found in promotors, introns, within or close to coding sequences, we suggest that they may be important regulators of transcriptional and phenotypic variation in this pathogen.\n\nAuthor summaryMutation is central to evolution: in pathogens, the rate of mutation may determine how rapidly drug resistance evolves or how effectively pathogens can escape immune attack. Malaria parasites have small extremely AT-rich genomes, and genetic variation in natural populations is dominated by repeat number changes in short tandem repeats (microsatellites) rather than point mutations. We therefore focused on quantifying microsatellite mutation. We established 31 parasite cultures in the laboratory all derived from a single parasite cell. These were maintained for 114-267 days with frequent reductions to a single cell, so parasites accumulated mutations during ~13,207 cell divisions. We sequenced the parasite genomes at the end of the experiment to count the mutations. We highlight several conclusions: like other organisms studied, microsatellite mutation rates are associated with both repeat number and repeat motif. However, 41% of changes resulted from loss or gain of more than one repeat: this was particularly true for long repeat arrays. Unlike other eukaryotes, we found no insertions or deletions that were not associated with repeats or homology regions. Overall, we found that microsatellite mutation rates in malaria were amongst the lowest recorded and comparable to those in another AT-rich protozoan (the slime mold Dictyostelium).",

To provide new insights in the biology of sleep-associated adverse lipid profile, we conducted multi-ancestry genome-wide sleep-SNP interaction analyses on three lipid traits (HDL-c, LDL-c and triglycerides). In the total study sample (discovery + replication) of 126,926 individuals from 5 different ancestry groups, when considering either long or short total sleep time interactions in joint analyses, we identified 49 novel lipid loci, and 10 additional novel lipid loci in a restricted sample of European-ancestry cohorts. In addition, we identified new gene-sleep interactions for known lipid loci such as LPL and PCSK9. The novel gene-sleep interactions had a modest explained variance in lipid levels: most notable, gene-short-sleep interactions explained 4.25% of the variance in triglyceride concentration. Collectively, these findings contribute to our understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in sleep-associated adverse lipid profiles.",

We find that on the sphere such connections distort the maps that single grid units would express on their own, and aggregate them into clusters. When remapping to a different spherical environment, units in each cluster maintain only partial coherence, similar to what is observed in disordered materials, such as spin glasses.",

    "abstract": "Obtaining atomistic resolution of ligand dissociation from a protein is a much sought after experimental and computational challenge. Structural details of the dissociation process are in general hard to capture in experiments, while the relevant timescales are far beyond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations even with the most powerful super-computers. As such many different specialized enhanced sampling methods have been proposed that make it possible to efficiently calculate the dissociation mechanisms in protein-ligand systems. However, accurate benchmarks against long unbiased MD simulations are either not reported yet or simply not feasible due to the extremely long timescales. In this manuscript, we consider one such recent method \"infrequent metadynamics\", and benchmark in detail the various thermodynamics and kinetic information obtained from this method against extensive unbiased MD simulations for the dissociation dynamics of two different millimolar fragments from the protein FKBP in explicit water with residence times in nanoseconds to microseconds regime. We find that the metadynamics approach gives the same binding free energy profile, dissociation pathway and ligand residence time as the unbiased MD, albeit using only 6 to 50 times lower computational resources. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the metadynamics approach can self-consistently be used to ascertain whether the reweighted kinetic constants are reliable or not. We thus conclude that the answer to the question posed in the title of this manuscript is: statistically speaking, yes.",

The mechanisms that regulate these transitions are poorly understood, but are associated with transcriptional changes. Brother of Regulator of Imprinted Sites (BORIS), also known as CCCTC binding factor-Like (CTCFL), is a transcriptional modulator that becomes aberrantly expressed in melanoma. Here, we provide the first evidence that BORIS is involved in phenotype switching in melanoma. Genetic modification of BORIS expression in melanoma cells combined with whole transcriptome analysis indicated that BORIS expression contributes to an invasion-associated transcriptome. In agreement with this finding, inducible BORIS overexpression in melanoma cells reduced proliferation and increased migration and invasion, demonstrating that the transcriptional switch is accompanied by a phenotypic switch.

    "abstract": "A long-held view in evolutionary biology is that character displacement generates divergent phenotypes in closely related coexisting species to avoid the costs of hybridisation or ecological competition, whereas an alternative possibility is that signals of dominance or aggression may instead converge to facilitate coexistence among ecological competitors. Although this counter-intuitive process--termed convergent agonistic character displacement--is supported by recent theoretical and empirical studies, the extent to which it drives spatial patterns of trait evolution at continental scales remains unclear. By modeling variation in song structure of two ecologically similar species of Hypocnemis antbird across western Amazonia, we show that their territorial signals converge such that trait similarity peaks in the sympatric zone, where intense interspecific territoriality between these taxa has previously been demonstrated. We also use remote sensing data to show that signal convergence is not explained by environmental gradients and is thus unlikely to evolve by sensory drive (i.e. acoustic adaptation to the sound transmission properties of habitats). Our results suggest that agonistic character displacement driven by interspecific competition can generate spatial patterns opposite to those predicted by classic character displacement theory, and highlight the potential role of social selection in shaping geographical variation in signal phenotypes of ecological competitors.",

    "abstract": "Reactive sulfane sulfur species such as hydrogen polysulfide and organic persulfide are newly recognized as normal cellular components, involved in signaling and protecting cells from oxidative stress. Their production is extensively studied, but their removal is less characterized. Herein, we showed that reactive sulfane sulfur is toxic at high levels, and it is mainly removed via reduction by thioredoxin and glutaredoxin with the release of H2S in Escherichia coli. OxyR is best known to respond to H2O2, and it also played an important role in responding to reactive sulfane sulfur under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. It was modified by hydrogen polysulfide to OxyR C199-SSH, which activated the expression of thioredoxin 2 and glutaredoxin 1. This is a new type of OxyR modification. Bioinformatics analysis showed that OxyRs are widely present in bacteria, including strict anaerobic bacteria. Thus, the OxyR sensing of reactive sulfane sulfur may represent a conserved mechanism for bacteria to deal with sulfane sulfur stress.",
