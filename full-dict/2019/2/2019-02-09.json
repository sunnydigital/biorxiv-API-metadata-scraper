    "abstract": "This work reports a dynamical Markov state model of CLC-2 \"fast\" (pore) gating, based on 600 microseconds of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. In the starting conformation of our CLC-2 model, both outer and inner channel gates are closed. The first conformational change in our dataset involves rotation of the inner-gate backbone along residues S168-G169-I170. This change is strikingly similar to that observed in the cryo-EM structure of the bovine CLC-K channel, though the volume of the intracellular (inner) region of the ion conduction pathway is further expanded in our model. From this state (inner gate open and outer gate closed), two additional states are observed, each involving a unique rotameric flip of the outer-gate residue GLUex. Both additional states involve conformational changes that orient GLUex away from the extracellular (outer) region of the ion conduction pathway. In the first additional state, the rotameric flip of GLUex results in an open, or near-open, channel pore. The equilibrium population of this state is low ([~]1%), consistent with the low open probability of CLC-2 observed experimentally in the absence of a membrane potential stimulus (0 mV). In the second additional state, GLUex rotates to occlude the channel pore. This state, which has a low equilibrium population ([~]1%), is only accessible when GLUex is protonated. Together, these pathways model the opening of both an inner and outer gate within the CLC-2 selectivity filter, as a function of GLUex protonation. Collectively, our findings are consistent with published experimental analyses of CLC-2 gating and provide a high-resolution structural model to guide future investigations.\n\nAuthor summaryIn the brain, the roles and mechanisms of sodium-, potassium-, and calcium-selective ion channels are well established. In contrast, chloride-selective channels have been studied much less and are not sufficiently understood, despite known associations of chloride-channel defects with brain disorders. The most broadly expressed voltage-activated chloride channel in the brain is CLC-2 (one of 9 human CLC homologs). In this work, we use simulations to model the conformational dynamics of the CLC-2 chloride ion channel selectivity filter (SF), which is the part of the protein that controls whether the channel is in an ion-conducting or non-conducting state. Our analysis identifies four primary conformational states and a specific progression through these states. Our results are consistent with structural and functional data in the literature and provide a high-resolution model for guiding further studies of CLC-2. These results will inform our understanding of how CLC-2 governs electrical activity and ion homeostasis in the brain.",

    "abstract": "It is an uninformative truism to state that the brain operates at multiple spatial and temporal scales, each with each own set of emergent phenomena. More worthy of attention is the point that our current understanding of it cannot clearly indicate which of these phenomenological scales are the significant contributors to the brains function and primary output (i.e. behaviour). Apart from the sheer complexity of the problem, a major contributing factor to this state of affairs is the lack of instrumentation that can simultaneously address these multiple scales without causing function altering damages to the underlying tissue. One important facet of this problem is that standard neural recording devices normally require one output connection per electrode. This limits the number of electrodes that can fit along the thin shafts of implantable probes generating a limiting balance between density and spread. Sharing a single output connection between multiple electrodes relaxes this constraint and permits designs of ultra-high density probes.\n\nHere we report the design and in-vivo validation of such a device, a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) scanning probe with 1344 electrodes; the outcome of the European research project NeuroSeeker. We show that this design targets both local and global spatial scales by allowing the simultaneous recording of more than 1000 neurons spanning 7 functional regions with a single shaft. The neurons show similar recording longevity and signal to noise ratio to passive probes of comparable size and no adverse effects in awake or anesthetized animals. Addressing the data management of this device we also present novel visualization and monitoring methods. Using the probe with freely moving animals we show how accessing a number of cortical and subcortical brain regions offers a novel perspective on how the brain operates around salient behavioural events. Finally, we compare this probe with lower density, non CMOS designs (which have to adhere to the one electrode per output line rule). We show that an increase in density results in capturing neural firing patterns, undetectable by lower density devices, which correlate to self-similar structures inherent in complex naturalistic behaviour.\n\nTo help design electrode configurations for future, even higher density, CMOS probes, recordings from many different brain regions were obtained with an ultra-dense passive probe.",

    "abstract": "We investigated age-related differences in syntactic comprehension in young and older adults. Most previous research found no evidence of age-related decline in syntactic processing. We investigated elementary syntactic comprehension of minimal sentences (e.g. I cook), minimizing the influence of working memory. We also investigated the contribution of semantic processing by comparing sentences containing real verbs (e.g. I cook) versus pseudoverbs (e.g. I spuff). We measured the speed and accuracy of detecting syntactic agreement errors (e.g. I cooks, I spuffs). We found that older adults were slower and less accurate than younger adults in detecting syntactic agreement errors for both real and pseudoverb sentences, suggesting there is age-related decline in syntactic comprehension. The age-related decline in accuracy was smaller for the pseudoverb sentences, and the decline in speed was larger for the pseudoverb sentences, compared to real verb sentences. We suggest that syntactic comprehension decline is stronger in the absence of semantic information, which causes older adults to produce slower responses in order to make more accurate decisions. In line with these findings, performance for older adults was positively related to a measure of processing speed capacity. Taken together, we found evidence that elementary syntactic processing abilities decline in healthy ageing.",

    "abstract": "The human prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been associated more with meta-perceptual as opposed to meta-memory decisions from correlational neuroimaging investigations. Recently, metacognitive abilities have also been shown to be causally dependent upon anterior and dorsal PFC in non-human primate lesion studies. Two studies, utilizing post-decision wagering paradigms and reversible inactivation, challenged this meta-perceptual versus meta-memory notion and showed that dorsal and anterior prefrontal areas are associated with metamemory for experienced objects and awareness of ignorance respectively. Causal investigations are important but scarce; nothing is known, for example, about the causal contributions of prefrontal sub-regions to spatial metamemory. Here, we investigated the effects of dorsal versus ventral PFC lesions on two-alternative forced choice spatial discrimination tasks in male macaque monkeys. Importantly, we were rigorous in approach and applied three independent but complementary indices used to quantify individual animals metacognitive ability (\"type II sensitivity\") namely meta-d', d' measures, and Phi coefficient ({Phi}). Our results were consistent across indices: while neither lesions to superior dorsolateral PFC (sdlPFC) nor orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) impaired spatial recognition performance, only monkeys with sdlPFC lesions were impaired in meta-accuracy. Together with the observation that the same OFC lesioned monkeys were impaired in updating rule-value in a Wisconsin Card Sorting Test analog, we therefore document a functional double-dissociation between these two PFC regions. Out study presents important causal evidence that other dimensions, namely domain-specific processing (e.g., spatial versus non-spatial metamemory), also need considerations in understanding the functional specialization in the neural underpinnings of introspection.\n\nSignificance StatementThis study demonstrates macaque monkeys meta-cognitive capability of introspecting its own memory success is causally dependent on intact superior dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (PFC) but not the orbitofrontal cortices. Combining neurosurgical techniques on monkeys and state-of-the-art measures of metacognition, we affirm a critical role of the PFC in supporting spatial meta-recognition memory and delineate functional specificity within PFC for distinct elements of metacognition.",

    "abstract": "Cortical actomyosin flows play pivotal roles in cell motility, cell division and animal morphogenesis. According to many model systems, myosin motor induced local contractions are key for generating cortical flows. However, the original mechanism how large-scale directed flows emerge from local motor activity in an apparently isotropic cortex is unknown. We reconstituted and confined minimal actomyosin cortices to the interfaces of emulsion droplets. The presence of ATP leads to myosin-induced cortical contractions that self-organize into directed flow-like actomyosin motions. By combining our experiments with theory, we found that the large-scale directional motion of actomyosin clusters emerges from individual asymmetric cluster vibrations, caused by intrinsic non-isotropic ATP consumption, in conjunction with spherical confinement. By tracking individual actomyosin clusters, we identified fingerprints of vibrational states as the basis of directed motions. These vibrations may represent a generic key driver of directed actomyosin flows under spatial confinement in vitro and in living systems.",

    "abstract": "1Many biomolecular complexes exist in a flexible ensemble of states in solution which are necessary to perform their biological function. Small angle scattering (SAS) measurements are a popular method for characterizing these flexible molecules due to their relative ease of use and ability to simultaneously probe the full ensemble of states. However, SAS data is typically low-dimensional and difficult to interpret without the assistance of additional structural models. In theory, experimental SAS curves can be reconstituted from a linear combination of theoretical models, although this procedure carries significant risk of overfitting the inherently low-dimensional SAS data. Previously, we developed a Bayesian-based method for fitting ensembles of model structures to experimental SAS data that rigorously avoids overfitting. However, we have found that these methods can be difficult to incorporate into typical SAS modeling workflows, especially for users that are not experts in computational modeling. To this end, we present the \"Bayesian Ensemble Estimation from SAS\" (BEES) program. Two forks of BEES are available, the primary one existing as module for the SASSIE webserver and a developmental version that is a standalone python program. BEES allows users to exhaustively sample ensemble models constructed from a library of theoretical states and to interactively analyze and compare each models performance. The fitting routine also allows for secondary data sets to be supplied, thereby simultaneously fitting models to both SAS data as well as orthogonal information. The flexible ensemble of K63-linked ubiquitin trimers is presented as an example of BEES capabilities.",

The source of these inconsistencies can often be traced to translated text file formats designed to describe long read alignments and predicted gene structures. The majority of gene prediction frameworks do not provide downstream filtering to remove problematic gene annotations, nor do they represent these annotations in a format consistent with current file standards. In addition, these frameworks lack consideration for functional attributes, such as the presence or absence of protein domains which can be used for gene model validation. To provide oversight to the increasing number of published genome annotations, we present gFACs as a software package to filter, analyze, and convert predicted gene models and alignments. gFACs operates across a wide range of alignment, analysis, and gene prediction software inputs with a flexible framework for defining gene models with reliable structural and functional attributes. gFACs supports common downstream applications, including genome browsers and generates extensive details on the filtering process, including distributions that can be visualized to further assess the proposed gene space.",

    "abstract": "mRNA localization serves key functions in localized protein production making it critical that the translation machinery itself is present at these locations. Here we show that translation factor mRNAs are localized to distinct granules within yeast cells. In contrast to many mRNP granules, such as P-bodies and stress granules, which contain translationally repressed mRNAs, these granules harbor translated mRNAs under active growth conditions. The granules require Pablp for their integrity and are inherited by developing daughter cells in a She2p/ She3p dependent manner. These results point to a model where roughly half the mRNA for certain translation factors are specifically directed in granules toward the tip of the developing daughter cell where protein synthesis is most heavily required, which has particular implications for filamentous forms of growth. Such a feedforward mechanism would ensure adequate provision of the translation machinery where it is to be needed most over the coming growth cycle.\n\nSummaryThis study shows that mRNAs encoding a range of translation factors are localized to granules that get transported into the yeast daughter cell using the She2p/She3p machinery. This likely supports an intensification of protein synthetic activity to facilitate apical polarized growth.",

    "abstract": "Heart rate variability (HRV) is a widely adopted tool for evaluating changes in cardiac autonomic regulation. The majority of efforts have focused on developing methods to assess HRV by deriving sophisticated parameters with linear and nonlinear techniques and adopting advanced signal processing tools for efficient noise removal and accurate QRS detection. In this paper, we propose a novel representation of beat-to-beat variation in an electrocardiogram (ECG), called heart rate n-variability (HRnV), as an alternative to conventional HRV measures. We derived two novel HRnV measures based on non-overlapped and overlapped RR intervals. We also conducted a simulation study by using an ECG record from the MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Database to demonstrate the feasibility of calculating HRnV parameters. Among the time domain parameters, we observed that the values were generally incremental with the increase in n. We observed the same trend of changes for the frequency domain parameters. In the nonlinear analysis, the differences between HRV and HRnV from Poincare plot measures were obvious, while those from entropy and detrended fluctuation analysis metrics were not. HRnV measures enable us to augment conventional HRV measures with additional parameters. Although issues remain to be addressed regarding HRnV, we hope to stimulate a new stream of research on this new representation of HRV. HRnV is an important addition to HRV and will contribute to extending the landscape of current studies on HRV.",

Here, we show that recently developed machine-learning libraries (TensorFlow and PyTorch) facilitate implementation of genomics methods for GPUs and significantly accelerate computations. To demonstrate this, we re-implemented methods for two commonly performed computational genomics tasks: QTL mapping and Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization. Our implementations ran > 200 times faster than current CPU-based versions, and these analyses are [~]5-10 fold cheaper on GPUs due to the vastly shorter runtimes. We anticipate that the accessibility of these libraries, and the improvements in run-time will lead to a transition to GPU-based implementations for a wide range of computational genomics methods.",

Taste responses in the rodent primary gustatory cortex (GC) span this sensorimotor divide, progressing through a series of firing epochs that culminate in the emergence of action-related firing. Population analyses reveal this emergence to be a sudden, coherent ensemble transition that, despite varying in latency between trials, precedes gaping onset by 0.2-0.3s. Here, we tested whether this transition drives gaping, delivering 0.5s GC perturbations at various time-points in tasting trials. Perturbations significantly delayed gaping, but only when they preceded the action-related transition - thus, the same perturbation might have an impact or not, depending on the transition latency in that particular trial. Our results suggest a distributed attractor network model of taste processing, and a dynamical role for cortex in driving motor behavior.",

    "abstract": "Gene set enrichment (GSE) testing enhances the biological interpretation of ChIP-seq data and other large sets of genomic regions. Our group has previously introduced two GSE methods for genomic regions: ChIP-Enrich for narrow regions and Broad-Enrich for broad genomic regions, such as histone modifications. Here, we introduce new methods and extensions that more appropriately analyze sets of genomic regions with vastly different properties. First, we introduce Poly-Enrich, which models the number of peaks assigned to a gene using a generalized additive model with a negative binomial family to determine gene set enrichment, while adjusting for gene locus length (#bps associated with each gene). This is the first method that controls for locus length while accounting for the number of peaks per gene and variability among genes. We also introduce a flexible weighting approach to incorporate region scores, a hybrid enrichment approach, and support for new gene set databases and reference genomes/species.\n\nAs opposed to ChIP-Enrich, Poly-Enrich works well even when nearly all genes have a peak. To illustrate this, we used Poly-Enrich to characterize the pathways and types of genic regions (introns, promoters, etc) enriched with different families of repetitive elements. By comparing ChIP-Enrich and Poly-Enrich results from ENCODE ChIP-seq data, we found that the optimal test depends more on the pathway being regulated than on the transcription factor or other properties of the dataset. Using known transcription factor functions, we discovered clusters of related biological processes consistently better modeled with either the binary score method (ChIP-Enrich) or count based method (Poly-Enrich). This suggests that the regulation of certain processes is more often modified by multiple binding events (count-based), while others tend to require only one (binary). Our new hybrid method handles this by automatically choosing the optimal method, with correct FDR-adjustment.\n\nAuthor SummaryAlthough every cell in our body contains the same DNA, our cells perform vastly different functions due to differences in how our genes are regulated. Certain regions of the genome are bound by DNA binding proteins (transcription factors), which regulate the expression of nearby genes. After an experiment to identify a large set of these regions, we can then model the association of these regions with various cellular pathways and biological processes. This analysis helps understand the overall biological effect that the binding events have on the cells. For example, if genes relating to apoptosis tend to have the transcription factor, Bcl-2, bind more often nearby, then Bcl-2 is likely to have a vital role in regulating apoptosis. The specifics of how to best perform this analysis is still being researched and depends on properties of the set of genomic regions. Here, we introduce a new, more flexible method that counts the number of occurrences per gene and models that in a sophisticated statistical test, and compare it to a previous method. We show that the optimal method depends on multiple factors, and the new method, Poly-Enrich, allows interesting findings in scenarios where the previous method failed.",

We aimed to examine the development of collateral pathways after ligation of native vessels in a porcine model of PAD.\n\nMethodsRight hindlimb Ischemia was induced in domestic swine (N=11, male, kg) using two different versions of arterial ligation. Version 1 (N=6) consisted of ligation/division of the right external iliac, profunda femoral (RPFA) and superficial femoral arteries (RSFA). Version 2 (N=5) consisted of the ligation of Version 1 with additional ligation/division of the right internal iliac artery (RIIA). Development of collateral pathways was evaluated with standard angiography at baseline (prior to arterial ligation) and at termination (4-8 weeks later). Relative luminal diameter of the arteries supplying the ischemic right hindlimb were determined by 2D angiography, as percent of the size of the distal aortic diameter.\n\nResultsThe dominant collateral pathway that developed after version 1 ligation connected the RIIA to the RPFA and RSFA/popliteal artery. Mean luminal diameter ({+/-} standard error) of the RIIA at termination increased by 38% (P<0.05) compared to baseline. Two co-dominant collateral pathways developed in version: (i) from the common internal iliac trunk and left internal iliac artery to the reconstituted RIIA, which then supplied the RPFA and RSFA/popliteal arteries; and (ii) from left profunda artery to the reconstituted RPFA. Mean diameter of the common internal iliac trunk and left profunda artery both increased at termination in the range of 20% (p < 0.05).\n\nConclusionTwo versions of hindlimb ischemia induction (right ilio-femoral artery ligation with and without right internal iliac artery ligation in swine produced differing collateral pathways, along with changes to the diameter of the inflow vessels (i.e., arteriogenesis). Radiographic and anatomical data of the collateral formation in this porcine model should have value in investigation of the pathophysiology of hindlimb ischemia, and assessment of angiogenic therapies as potential treatments for PAD.",

    "abstract": "Our ability to stay focused is limited: prolonged performance of a task typically results in mental fatigue and decrements in performance over time. This so-called vigilance decrement has been attributed to depletion of attentional resources, though other factors such as reductions in motivation likely also play a role. In this study, we examined three EEG markers of attentional control, to elucidate which stage of attentional processing is most affected by time-on-task and motivation. To elicit the vigilance decrement, participants performed a sustained attention task for 80 minutes without breaks. After 60 minutes, participants were motivated by an unexpected monetary incentive to increase performance in the final 20 minutes. We found that task performance and self-reported motivation declined rapidly, reaching a stable levels well before the motivation manipulation was introduced. Thereafter, motivation increased back up to the initial level, and remained there for the final 20 minutes. While task performance also increased, it did not return to the initial level, and fell to the lowest level overall during the final 10 minutes. This pattern of performance changes was mirrored by the trial-to-trial consistency of the phase of theta (3-7 Hz) oscillations, an index of the variability in timing of the neural response to the stimulus. As task performance decreased, temporal variability increased, suggesting that attentional stability is crucial for sustained attention performance. The effects of attention on our two other EEG measures--early P1/N1 event-related potentials and pre-stimulus alpha (9-14 Hz) power--did not change with time-on-task or motivation. In sum, these findings show that the vigilance decrement is accompanied by a decline in only some facets of attentional control, which cannot be fully brought back online by increases in motivation. The vigilance decrement might thus not occur due to a single cause, but is likely multifactorial in origin.",

    "abstract": "Mounting evidence supports that LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposition can occur postzygotically in healthy and diseased human tissues, contributing to genomic mosaicism in the brain and other somatic tissues of an individual. However, the genomic distribution of somatic L1Hs (Human-specific LINE-1) insertions and their potential impact on carrier cells remain unclear. Here, using a PCR-based targeted bulk sequencing approach, we profiled 9,181 somatic insertions from 20 postmortem tissues from five Rett patients and their matched healthy controls. We identified and validated somatic L1Hs insertions in both cortical neurons and non-brain tissues. In Rett patients, somatic insertions were significantly depleted in exons--mainly contributed by long genes--than healthy controls, implying that cells carrying MECP2 mutations might be defenseless against a second exonic L1Hs insertion. We observed a significant increase of somatic L1Hs insertions in the brain compared with non-brain tissues from the same individual. Compared to germline insertions, somatic insertions were less sense-depleted to transcripts, indicating that they underwent weaker selective pressure on the orientation of insertion. Our observations demonstrate that somatic L1Hs insertions contribute to genomic diversity and MECP2 dysfunction alters their genomic patterns in Rett patients.\n\nAuthor SummaryHuman-specific LINE-1 (L1Hs) is the most active autonomous retrotransposon family in the human genome. Mounting evidence supports that L1Hs retrotransposition occurs postzygotically in the human brain cells, contributing to neuronal genomic diversity, but the extent of L1Hs-driven mosaicism in the brain is debated. In this study, we profiled genome-wide L1Hs insertions among 20 postmortem tissues from Rett patients and matched controls. We identified and validated somatic L1Hs insertions in both cortical neurons and non-brain tissues, with a higher jumping activity in the brain. We further found that MECP2 dysfunction might alter the genomic pattern of somatic L1Hs in Rett patients.",

Overexpression of C/EBP{delta} in different tumors as glioblastoma and breast cancer either promotes tumor progression or inhibits growth.

We show that the FTE have both mesenchymal and epithelial cell characteristics. Further, our data supports a role for C/EBP{delta} as an early regulatory transcriptional factor that promotes a mesenchymal to epithelial (MET) phenotype by upregulating E-cadherin and downregulating vimentin and N-cadherin in FTE cells. We demonstrate that overexpression of C/EBP{delta} in ovarian and breast cancer cell lines have consistent effects and phenotype as the FTE cells.

The cdtB subunit is a DNAse that causes eukaryotic cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and in one context, is associated with resistance against parasitoid wasp infections. Here we report the discovery of functional cdtB copies in the nuclear genomes of insect species from two distantly related insect orders, including fruit flies (Diptera: Drosophilidae) and aphids (Hemiptera: Aphididae). Insect cdtB copies are most closely related to bacteriophage copies, were horizontally transferred to insect genomes > 40 million years ago and encode a protein that retains ancestral DNase activity. This phage-derived toxin has been domesticated by diverse insects and we hypothesize that it is used as a defensive weapon against parasitoid wasps.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryWe report horizontal transfer of the gene cytolethal distending toxin B, which encodes a DNase, into eukaryotic genomes from bacteriophage.\n\nSignificanceCytolethal distending toxins (CDTs) are secreted by diverse pathogenic bacterial species to kill animal cells. The cdtB subunit enters cell nuclei, damaging the DNA and leading to mitotic arrest and apoptosis. In the pea aphid, a bacterial endosymbiont provides protection against wasp attack, possibly via cdtB. We discovered that this same endosymbiont-encoded lineage of cdtB was transferred to the genomes of Diptera and Hemiptera species and retains ancestral DNase activity. This is the first report of cdtB outside of bacteria or phages. A toxin that first evolved to kill eukaryotic cells has been co-opted by insects, potentially to their benefit.",

    "abstract": "Gastropods are known to secrete mucus for a variety of purposes, including locomotion, reproduction, adhesion to surfaces, and lubrication. A less commonly known function of mucus secretion in this group involves its use as a defence against predation. Among the terrestrial slugs, mucus that serves this particular purpose has been studied for only a handful of species under laboratory conditions, where it is thought to be produced for self-fouling or to make individuals difficult to consume. However, the mechanisms of how these defensive secretions operate and their effectiveness in deterring predation in the natural world have not be described in much detail. In this study, we provide evidence of adhesive mucus secretions in the red triangle slug (Triboniophorus graeffei) as an adaptation against predation. Field observations of a large red-eyed green tree frog (Litoria chloris) trapped in the mucus secretions of a nearby T. graeffei revealed that this mucus serves to incapacitate predators rather than just simply as an overall deterrence. Mechanical stimulation of T. graeffei under laboratory conditions revealed that adhesive secretions were produced from discrete sections of the dorsal surface when disturbed, leading to the production of a highly sticky and elastic mucus that was unlike the thin and slippery mucus used during locomotion. The adhesiveness of the defensive secretions was strengthened and reactivated when in contact with water. This appears to not only be the first description of defensive mucus production in this slug species but one of the first natural observations of the use of adhesive defence secretions to incapacitate a predator. The biomechanical properties of this mucus and its ability to maintain and strengthen its hold under wet conditions make it potentially useful in the development of new adhesive materials.",

    "abstract": "Many antibiotics target the assembly of cell wall peptidoglycan, an essential, heteropolymeric mesh that encases most bacteria. Different species have characteristic subcellular sites of peptidoglycan synthesis that they must carefully maintain for surface integrity and, ultimately, viability. In rod-shaped bacteria, cell wall elongation is spatially precise yet relies on a limited pool of lipid-linked precursors that generate and are attracted to membrane disorder. By tracking enzymes, substrates and products of peptidoglycan biosynthesis in Mycobacterium smegmatis, we show that precursors are made in plasma membrane domains that are laterally and biochemically distinct from sites of cell wall assembly. Membrane partitioning is required for robust, orderly peptidoglycan synthesis, indicating that these domains help template peptidoglycan synthesis. The cell wall-organizing protein DivIVA and the cell wall itself are essential for domain homeostasis. Thus, the peptidoglycan polymer feeds back on its membrane template to maintain an environment conducive to directional synthesis. We further show that our findings are applicable to rod-shaped bacteria that are phylogenetically distant from M. smegmatis, demonstrating that horizontal compartmentalization of precursors is a general feature of bacillary cell wall biogenesis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotic cells, the homology-directed repair (HDR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathways are required for the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSB). The high-fidelity HDR pathway is particularly important for maintenance of genomic stability. In mammals, histone post-translational modifications and histone variant exchange into nucleosomes at sites of DSB generate an open chromatin state necessary for repair to take place. However, the specific contributions of histone modifications to histone variant exchange at DSB sites and the influence of these changes on the DNA repair process and genome stability are incompletely understood. Here we show that Dot1L-catalyzed methylation of H3 histone on lysine 79 (H3K79) is required for efficient HDR of DSB. In cells with DNA DSB either lacking Dot1L or expressing a methylation-dead Dot1L, there is altered kinetics of DNA repair factor recruitment, markedly decreased H2A.Z incorporation at DSB sites, and a specific and profound reduction in HDR, which results in significant genomic instability. These findings demonstrate a new role for Dot1L, identifying it as a critical regulator of the DNA repair process and a steward of genomic integrity.",

    "abstract": "Microtubules are dynamic polymers that play fundamental roles in all eukaryotes. Despite their importance, how new microtubules form is poorly understood. Textbooks have focused on variations of a nucleation-elongation mechanism in which monomers rapidly equilibrate with an unstable oligomer (nucleus) that limits the rate of polymer formation; once formed, the polymer then elongates efficiently from this nucleus by monomer addition. Such models faithfully describe actin assembly, but they fail to account for how more complex polymers like hollow microtubules assemble. Here we articulate a new model for microtubule formation that has three key features: i) microtubules initiate via rectangular, sheet-like structures which grow faster the larger they become; ii) the dominant pathway proceeds via accretion, stepwise addition of longitudinal or lateral layers; iii) a  straightening penalty to account for the energetic cost of tubulins curved-to-straight conformational transition. This model can quantitatively fit experimental assembly data, providing new insights into biochemical determinants and assembly pathways for microtubule nucleation.",

    "abstract": "TAF1 intellectual disability syndrome is an X-linked disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the TAF1 gene. How these mutations cause dysmorphology, hypotonia, intellectual and motor defects is unknown. Mouse models which have embryonically targeted TAF1 have failed, possibly due to TAF1 being essential for viability, preferentially expressed in early brain development, and intolerant of mutation. Novel animal models are valuable tools for understanding neuronal pathology. Here, we report the development and characterization of a novel animal model for TAF1 ID syndrome in which the TAF1 gene is deleted in embryonic rats using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) associated protein 9 (Cas9) technology and somatic brain transgenesis mediated by lentiviral transduction. Rat pups, post-natal day 3, were subjected to intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of either gRNA-control or gRNA-TAF1 vectors. Rats were subjected to a battery of behavioral tests followed by histopathological analyses of brains at post-natal day 14 and day 35. TAF1-edited rats exhibited behavioral deficits at both the neonatal and juvenile stages of development. Deletion of TAF1 lead to a hypoplasia and loss of the Purkinje cells. Abnormal motor symptoms in TAF1-edited rats were associated with irregular cerebellar output caused by changes in the intrinsic activity of the Purkinje cells. Immunostaining revealed a reduction in the expression of the CaV3.1 T-type calcium channel. This animal model provides a powerful new tool for studies of neuronal dysfunction in conditions associated with TAF1 abnormalities and should prove useful for developing therapeutic strategies to treat TAF1 ID syndrome.\n\nSignificance StatementIntellectual disability (ID) syndrome is an X-linked rare disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the TAF1 gene.

    "abstract": "BackgroundInduction and reversal of chromatin silencing is critical for successful development, tissue homeostasis and the derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) and reactivation (XCR) in female cells represent chromosome-wide transitions between active and inactive chromatin states. While XCI has long been studied and provided important insights into gene regulation, the dynamics and mechanisms underlying the reversal of stable chromatin silencing of X-linked genes are much less understood. Here, we use allele-specific transcriptomic approaches to study XCR during mouse iPSC reprogramming in order to elucidate the timing and mechanisms of chromosome-wide reversal of gene silencing.\n\nResultsWe show that XCR is hierarchical, with subsets of genes reactivating early, late and very late. Early genes are activated before the onset of late pluripotency genes activation and the complete silencing of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Xist. These genes are located genomically closer to genes that escape XCI, unlike those reactivating late. Interestingly, early genes also show increased pluripotency transcription factor (TF) binding. We also reveal that histone deacetylases (HDACs) restrict XCR in reprogramming intermediates and that the severe hypoacetylation state of the Xi persists until late reprogramming stages.\n\nConclusionsAltogether, these results reveal the timing of transcriptional activation of mono-allelically repressed genes during iPSC reprogramming, and suggest that allelic activation involves the combined action of chromatin topology, pluripotency transcription factors and chromatin regulators. These findings are important for our understanding of gene silencing, maintenance of cell identity, reprogramming and disease.",

    "abstract": "Exercise is a potent enhancer of learning and memory, yet we know little of the underlying mechanisms that likely include alterations in synaptic efficacy in the hippocampus. To address this issue, we exposed mice to a single episode of voluntary exercise, and permanently marked mature hippocampal dentate granule cells that were specifically activated during exercise using conditional Fos-TRAP mice. Only a few dentate granule cells were active at baseline, but two hours of voluntary exercise markedly increased the number of activated neurons. Activated neurons (Fos-TRAPed) showed an input-selective increase in dendritic spines and excitatory postsynaptic currents at 3 days post-exercise, indicative of exercise-induced structural plasticity. Laser-capture microdissection and RNASeq of activated neurons revealed that the most highly induced transcript was Mtss1L, a little-studied gene in the adult brain. Overexpression of Mtss1L in neurons increased spine density, leading us to hypothesize that its I-BAR domain initiated membrane curvature and dendritic spine formation. shRNA-mediated Mtss1L knockdown in vivo prevented the exercise-induced increases in spines and excitatory postsynaptic currents. Our results link short-term effects of exercise to activity-dependent expression of Mtss1L, which we propose as a novel effector of activity-dependent rearrangement of synapses.\n\nOne Sentence SummarySingle episodes of voluntary exercise induced a functional increase in hippocampal synapses mediated by activity-dependent expression of the BAR protein Mtss1L, acting as a novel early effector of synapse formation.",

    "abstract": "During hippocampal-dependent memory formation, sensory signals from the neocortex converge in the dentate gyrus. It is generally believed that the dentate gyrus decorrelates inputs in order to minimize interference between codes for similar experiences, often referred to as pattern separation. Emerging evidence from mouse models suggests that adult-born neurons exert an inhibitory influence on the dentate gyrus, which may be important for maintaining the sparse code that is needed to form precise memories. However, since the dentate gyrus is composed of a heterogeneous population of cells that are born throughout life, it is unclear if newborn neurons inhibit all cells equally. We therefore investigated whether adult neurogenesis in rats modulates activity in dentate gyrus neurons that are born at the peak of early postnatal development. Adult neurogenesis was increased by subjecting rats to an alternating running and memantine treatment schedule, and it was decreased with a transgenic GFAP-TK rat model. Activity was measured by quantifying experience-induced Fos expression in BrdU+ cells. Consistent with an inhibitory role, enhancing neurogenesis blocked experience-dependent Fos expression in developmentally-born neurons and also in the broader granule cell population. In contrast, blocking neurogenesis did not significantly impact activity patterns. These results confirm previous work in mice and identify the developmentally-born population of neurons as a major target of neurogenesis-mediated inhibition. Treatments that target neurogenesis may therefore benefit disorders that are characterized by excitation-inhibition imbalance in the hippocampus, such as age-related memory impairments, fear and anxiety, and epilepsy.",
