    "abstract": "The Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) mycolic acid flippase MmpL3 has been the proposed target for multiple inhibitors with diverse chemical scaffolds. This diversity in chemical scaffolds has made it difficult to predict compounds that inhibit MmpL3 without whole genome sequencing of isolated resistant mutants. Here we describe the identification of four new inhibitors that select for resistance mutations in mmpL3. Using these resistant mutants, we conducted a targeted whole-cell phenotypic screen of 163 novel Mtb growth inhibitors for differential growth inhibition of wild type Mtb as compared to a pool of twenty-four unique mmpL3 mutants. The screen successfully identified six additional putative MmpL3 inhibitors. The compounds were bactericidal both in vitro and against intracellular Mtb. Mtb cells treated with these compounds were shown to accumulate trehalose monomycolate and have reduced levels of trehalose dimycolate, supporting MmpL3 as the target. The inhibitors were mycobacteria specific with several also showing activity against the non-tuberculosis mycobacterial species M. abscessus. Cluster analysis of cross resistance profiles generated by dose response experiments for each combination of 13 MmpL3 inhibitors against each of the 24 mmpL3 mutants defined two clades of inhibitors and two clades of mmpL3 mutants. Pairwise combination studies of the inhibitors revealed interactions that were specific to the clades identified in the cross-resistance profiling. Additionally, modeling of resistance substitutions to the MmpL3 crystal structure revealed clade specific localization of the residues to specific domains of MmpL3, with the clades showing differential resistance. Several compounds exhibited high solubility and stability in microsomes and low cytotoxicity in macrophages, supporting their further development. The combined study of multiple mutants and novel compounds provides new insights into structure-function interactions of MmpL3 and small molecule inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Efficient gene deletion methods are essential for the high-throughput study of gene function. Compared to most ascomycete model systems, gene deletion is more laborious in mushroom-forming basidiomycetes due to the relatively low incidence of homologous recombination (HR) and relatively high incidence of non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). Here, we describe the use of pre-assembled Cas9-sgRNA ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) to efficiently delete the homeodomain transcription factor gene hom2 in the mushroom-forming basidiomycete Schizophyllum commune by replacing it with a selectable marker. All components (Cas9 protein, sgRNA, and repair template with selectable marker) were supplied to wild type protoplasts by PEG-mediated transformation, abolishing the need to optimize the expression of cas9 and sgRNAs. A {Delta}ku80 background further increased the efficiency of gene deletion. A repair template with homology arms of 250 bp was sufficient to induce homologous recombination, whereas 100 bp was not. This is the first report of the use of pre-assembled Cas9 RNPs in a mushroom-forming basidiomycete and this approach may also improve the genetic accessibility of non-model species.",

    "abstract": "We review the contribution of bioimaging in building a coherent understanding of Ca2+ signalling during legume-bacteria symbiosis. Currently, two different calcium signals are believed to control key steps of the symbiosis: a Ca2+ gradient at the tip of the legume root hair is involved in the development of an infection thread, while nuclear Ca2+ oscillations, the hallmark signal of this symbiosis, controls the formation of the root nodule, where bacteria fix nitrogen. Additionally, different Ca2+ spiking signatures have been associated with specific infection stages. Bioimaging is intrinsically a cross-disciplinary area that requires integration of image recording, processing and analysis. We use experimental examples to critically evaluate previously established conclusions and draw attention to challenges caused by the varying nature of the signal-to-noise ratio in live imaging. We hypothesise that nuclear Ca2+ spiking is a wide-range signal involving the entire root hair, and that Ca2+ signature may be related to cytoplasmic streaming.",

    "abstract": "The linguistic foundations of science and technology have relied on a range of terms many of which are borrowed from ancient languages, a known but little researched fact from a statistical perspective. Precise definitions and novel concepts are often crafted with those -- frequently used -- terms, yet their etymology from Greek or Latin might not always be fully appreciated. Herein, we demonstrate that frequently used terms span almost the entire PubMed(R) database, while a handful of terms of Greek origin retrieve 80% of all entries. We argue that the etymology of those critical terms needs to be fully grasped to ensure correct use, in conjunction with other concepts. We further propose a number of terms for genomics, using prepositions that can accurately define subtle sub-disciplines of this ever-expanding field. Finally, we invite commentary by both the science community and the humanities, for possible adoption of suggested terms, not least to avoid inaccurate usage or inappropriate notions that may compromise clarity of meaning.",

    "abstract": "Macroevolutionary studies commonly apply multiple models to test state-dependent diversification. These models track the association between states of interest along a phylogeny, but they do not consider whether independent shifts in character states are associated with shifts in diversification rates. This potentially problematic issue has received little theoretical attention, while macroevolutionary studies implementing such models in increasing larger scale studies continue growing. A recent macroevolutionary study has found that Andean orogeny has acted as a species pump driving diversification of the family Liolaemidae, a highly species-rich lizard family native to temperate southern South America.\n\nThis study approaches a distribution-dependent hypothesis using the Geographic State Speciation and Extinction model (GeoSSE). However, more recent analyses have shown that there is a clear heterogeneous diversification pattern in the Liolaemidae, which likely biased the GeoSSE analysis. Specifically, we show here that there are two shifts to accelered speciation rates involving species groups that were classified as \"Andean\" in their distributions. We demonstrate that this GeoSSE result is meaningless when heterogeneous diversification rates are included. We use the lizard family Liolaemidae to demonstrate potential risks of ignoring clade-specific differences in diversification rates in macroevolutionary studies.",

    "abstract": "Species range expansion is a complex process whose outcome depends on the interplay of demographic, environmental and genetic factors. In plants, self-fertilizing species that do not require a mate to reproduce usually show higher invasive ability. However, this comes at a cost as both selfing and bottlenecks occurring during colonization lead to an increase in deleterious mutations accumulation (genetic load). Although they are theoretically clearly spelled out, the relationships between genomic and phenotypic characteristics of expanding populations have hitherto rarely been characterized.\n\nIn the present study we analyzed how different accessions of the shepherds purse, C. bursa-pastoris, coming from the front of colonization or from the core of the natural range performed under increasing density of competitors. We first showed that, as expected, accessions from the front of colonization performed the worst for most life history traits compared with accessions from core populations. Second, competitor density had a negative impact on both vegetative growth and reproductive output in term of fruits production for all accessions. However, somewhat unexpectedly given their higher genetic load and their lower absolute performance, accessions from the front of colonization were less affected by competition than accessions from the core of the species range. This could be due to phenotypic tradeoffs and a shift in phenology that allow the accessions from the front of colonization to avoid competition. These results are discussed in terms of ecological strategies of expanding populations.",

    "abstract": "In animals, cellularization of a coenocyte is a specialized form of cytokinesis that results in the formation of a polarized epithelium during early embryonic development. It is characterized by coordinated assembly of an actomyosin network, which drives inward membrane invaginations. However, whether coordinated cellularization driven by membrane invagination exists outside animals is not known. To that end, we investigate cellularization in the ichthyosporean Sphaeroforma arctica, a close unicellular relative of animals. We show that the process of cellularization involves coordinated inward plasma membrane invaginations dependent on an actomyosin network, and reveal the temporal order of its assembly. This leads to the formation of a polarized layer of cells resembling an epithelium. We show that this epithelium-like stage is associated with tightly regulated transcriptional activation of genes involved in cell adhesion. Hereby we demonstrate the presence of a selforganized, clonally-generated, polarized layer of cells in a unicellular relative of animals.",

Despite the importance of this interval, comprehensive genetic studies interrogating associations between HLA types, expression of non-HLA genes and disease, have not yet been conducted. To address this issue, we collected high-coverage whole genome sequence from 419 individuals and performed HLA typing at the highest resolution. Using RNA-seq from matched iPSC lines, we conducted an in-depth eQTL analysis using \"personalized\" transcripts, which significantly improved estimated expression levels of HLA genes, and showed HLA types have genetic associations independent from SNPs. We leveraged the eQTL results to examine associations between expression levels of non-HLA genes and disease. As a proof-of-principle, we investigated RNF5, whose protein product is a novel drug target in cystic fibrosis. We observed that decreased expression of RNF5 was associated with the 8.1 ancestral haplotype, which was previously found associated with protection against infection in cystic fibrosis. Overall, our study shows that genetically dissecting the MHC region provides novel insights into mechanisms underlying associations of this interval with disease.",

However, the involvement of perilesional and homologous contralateral regions in compensating for left-sided lesions remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to examine acute organizational changes in brain activity related to conceptual and lexical retrieval in unimpaired language production following transient disruption of the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG). In a randomized singleblind within-subject experiment, we recorded the electroencephalogram from sixteen healthy participants during a context-driven picture-naming task. Prior to the task, the left MTG was perturbed with real neuronavigated continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) or sham stimulation. During the task, participants read lead-in sentences that created a constraining (e.g. \"The farmer milks the\") or non-constraining context (e.g. \"The farmer buys the\"). The last word was shown as a picture that participants had to name (e.g. \"cow\"). Replicating behavioral studies, participants were overall faster in naming pictures following a constraining relative to a non-constraining context, but this effect did not differ between real and sham cTBS. Real cTBS, however, increased overall error rates compared to sham cTBS. In line with previous studies, we observed a decrease in alpha-beta (8-24 Hz) oscillatory power for constraining relative to non-constraining contexts over left temporal-parietal cortex after participants received sham cTBS. However, following real cTBS, this decrease extended towards left prefrontal regions associated with both domain-general and domain-specific control mechanisms. Our findings provide evidence that immediately after the disruption of the left MTG, the lexical-semantic network is able to quickly reconfigure, also recruiting domain-general regions.",

The aim of this study was to determine the safety, to describe pharmacokinetics characteristics, and to optimize dosage regimens of voriconazole in cirrhotic patients. Data pertaining to voriconazole were collected retrospectively and analyzed using a population pharmacokinetics model. A total of 219 trough concentrations (Cmin) from 120 patients were analyzed. Voriconazole-related adverse events developed in 29 patients, with 69.0% of AEs developing within the first week after voriconazole treatment. The threshold Cmin for AEs was 5.12 mg/L. A one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination adequately described the data. The Child-Pugh class was the only covariate in final model. Voriconazole clearance in patients with Child-pugh A and B cirrhosis (CP-A/CP-B) and Child-pugh C cirrhosis (CP-C) were 1.79 L/h and 0.99 L/h, respectively, the volume of distribution was 159.6 L, and the oral bioavailability was 91.8%.

Phylogenetic analyses showed that this genome, which was aligned with a number of historical and extant complete wolf and dog mtDNAs sampled worldwide, was closely related to an Italian wolf mtDNA genome (TN93 and p-distances = 0.0012), five to seven times shorter than divergence among Sicilian and any other known wolf mtDNA genomes (distance range = 0.0050 - 0.0070). Sicilian and Italian haplotypes joined a basal clade belonging to the mtDNA haplogroup-2 of ancient western European wolf populations (Pilot et al. 2010). Bayesian calibration of divergence times indicated that this clade coalesced at MRCA = 13.400 years (with 95% HPD = 4000 - 21.230 years). These mtDNA findings suggest that wolves probably colonized Sicily from southern Italy towards the end of the last Pleistocene glacial maximum, when the Strait of Messina was almost totally dry. Additional mtDNA and genomic data will further clarify the origin and population dynamics before the extinction of wolves in Sicily.",

Our goal was to define the physico-chemical biomaterial properties, including the polymer type, degradation, and pore interconnectivity of the scaffolds. Transplantation of human lung organoids (HLOs) on microporous poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) scaffolds or polycaprolactone (PCL) produced organoids that formed tube-like structures that resembled both the structure and cellular diversity of an adult lung airway. Microporous scaffolds formed from poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogel scaffolds inhibit maturation and the HLOs remain as lung progenitors. The structures formed from cells that occupy multiple pores within the scaffold, and pore interconnectivity and polymer degradation contributed to the maturation. Finally, the overall size of the generated airway structure and the total size of the tissue was influenced by the material degradation rate. Collectively, these biomaterial platforms provide a set of tools to promote maturation of the tissues and to control the size and structure of the organoids.",

    "abstract": "Full-scale anaerobic digestion processes for organic solid waste are common in Europe, but generally unaffordable in Canada and the United States because of inadequate regulations to restrict cheaper forms of disposal, particularly landfill. We investigated the viability of solid-state anaerobic digestion (SS-AD) as an alternative that reduces the costs of waste pretreatment and subsequent wastewater treatment. A laboratory SS-AD digester, comprising six 10L leach beds and an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor treating the leachate, was operated continuously for 88 weeks, with a mass balance of 101{+/-}2%. The feed was a mixture of cardboard, boxboard, newsprint, and fine paper, and varying amounts of food waste (from 0% to 29% on a COD basis). No process upset or instability was observed. The addition of food waste showed a synergistic effect, raising CH4 production from the fibre mixture from 52.7 L.kg-1COD fibreadded to 152 L.kg-1COD fibreadded, an increase of 190%. Substrate COD destruction efficiency reached 65% and a methane yield of 225 L.kg-1 CODadded was achieved at 29% food waste on a COD basis, and a solids retention time of 42 days. This performance was similar to that of a completely stirred tank reactor digesting similar wastes, but with much lower energy input.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=152 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/564203v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (122K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15c0e8aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@beadb3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7def43org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e717f5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The limitations of classical, soluble drugs in terms of subtype-specificity, spatiotemporal precision, and genetic targeting have spurred the development of advanced pharmacological techniques, including the use of covalently-tethered photoswitchable ligands. However, a major shortcoming of tethered photopharmacology is the inability to obtain optical control with a comparable efficacy to the native ligand. To overcome the limitations of photoisomerization efficiency and tethered ligand affinity, we have developed a family of branched photoswitchable compounds to target G protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). These compounds permit photo-agonism of Gi/o-coupled group II mGluRs with near-complete efficiency relative to saturating glutamate when attached to receptors via a range of orthogonal, multiplexable modalities including SNAP-, CLIP-, and Halo-tags, as well as via receptor-targeting nanobodies. Through a chimeric approach, branched ligands also allow efficient optical control of Gq-coupled mGluR5 with precise, dynamic subcellular targeting. Finally, branched ligands enabled the development of dual photoswitch-fluorophore compounds that allow simultaneous imaging and manipulation of receptors via the same attachment point. Together this work provides a new design framework for photoswitchable ligands and demonstrates a toolset suitable for quantitative, mechanistic study of neuromodulatory receptors at the molecular, cellular and circuit levels.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic promoters are commonly applied elements in circuit design for fine-tuning the protein expression levels. Promoter engineering was mostly focused on the random mutation or combination of regulation elements such as transcription factor binding sites. However, the size of promoter sequence space is still overwhelming and better navigation method is required. On the other hand, the generative adversarial network (GAN) is known for its great ability to reduce the searching space by learning to generate new data on the similar manifold of original data. Here, we applied WGAN-GP model into de novo promoter sequence design to generate entirely new promoter sequences. In total, 83 of model-generated promoter sequences were tested in promoter activity screening by regulating the expression of sfGFP gene in Escherichia coli. As a result, 26 out of 83 newly designed promoters were found functional and successfully expressed with varying activities, with similarity score to natural promoters all less than 0.7. Moreover, 3 of them showed higher promoter strength than the wild type promoters and their highly expression mutants. The much higher successful rate and promoter activity with much lower similarity score in our model-designed novel promoters confirmed the effectiveness of promoter sequence learning. Our work provides insights into an area of navigation of novel functional promoter sequence space automatically, as well as speeding up evolution process of naturally existing promoters, indicating the potential ability for deep generative models to be applied into genetic element designing in the future.",

With the advances of the big data era in biology, it is foreseeable that deep learning will become increasingly important in the field and will be incorporated in vast majorities of analysis pipelines.

We start from the recent achievements of deep learning in the bioinformatics field, pointing out the problems which are suitable to use deep learning. After that, we introduce deep learning in an easy-to-understand fashion, from shallow neural networks to legendary convolutional neural networks, legendary recurrent neural networks, graph neural networks, generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoder, and the most recent state-of-the-art architectures. After that, we provide eight examples, covering five bioinformatics research directions and all the four kinds of data type, with the implementation written in Tensorflow and Keras. Finally, we discuss the common issues, such as overfitting and interpretability, that users will encounter when adopting deep learning methods and provide corresponding suggestions.

    "abstract": "The development of mechanistic models of biological systems is a central part of Systems Biology. One major challenge in developing these models is the accurate inference of the model parameters. In the past years, nested sampling methods have gained an increasing amount of attention in the Systems Biology community. Some of the rather attractive features of these methods include that they are easily parallelizable and give an estimation of the variance of the final Bayesian evidence estimate from a single run. Still, the applicability of these methods is limited as they require the likelihood to be available and thus cannot be applied to stochastic systems with intractable likelihoods. In this paper, we present a likelihood-free nested sampling formulation that gives an unbiased estimator of the Bayesian evidence as well as samples from the posterior. Unlike most common nested sampling schemes we propose to use the information about the samples from the final prior volume to aid in the approximation of the Bayesian evidence and show how this allows us to formulate a lower bound on the variance of the obtained estimator. We proceed and use this lower bound to formulate a novel termination criterion for nested sampling approaches. We illustrate how our approach is applied to several realistically sized models with simulated data as well as recently published biological data. The presented method provides a viable alternative to other likelihood-free inference schemes such as Sequential Monte Carlo or Approximate Bayesian Computations methods. We also provide an intuitive and performative C++ implementation of our method.",

    "abstract": "Biomedical literature is growing at a rate that outpaces our ability to harness the knowledge contained therein. In order to mine valuable inferences from the large volume of literature, many researchers have turned to information extraction algorithms to harvest information in biomedical texts. Information extraction is usually accomplished via a combination of manual expert curation and computational methods. Advances in computational methods usually depends on the generation of gold standards by a limited number of expert curators. This process can be time consuming and represents an area of biomedical research that is ripe for exploration with citizen science. Citizen scientists have been previously found to be willing and capable of performing named entity recognition of disease mentions in biomedical abstracts, but it was uncertain whether or not the same could be said of relationship extraction. Relationship extraction requires training on identifying named entities as well as a deeper understanding of how different entity types can relate to one another. Here, we used the web-based application Mark2Cure (https://mark2cure.org) to demonstrate that citizen scientists can perform relationship extraction and confirm the importance of accurate named entity recognition on this task. We also discuss opportunities for future improvement of this system, as well as the potential synergies between citizen science, manual biocuration, and natural language processing.",

Our study has indicated keratin 1-based epidermal autofluorescence (AF) as a biomarker of this type: Inducers of both inflammation and oxidative stress dose-dependently increased epidermal green AF with polyhedral structure in mice, with the AF intensity being highly associated with the dosages of the inducers. Lung cancer also induced increased epidermal green AF of mice, which was mediated by inflammation. Significant and asymmetrical increases in green AF intensity with polyhedral structure were found in the Dorsal Index Fingers skin of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. While the AF intensity of the subjects with high risk for developing AIS, ischemic stroke patients in recovery phase and lung cancer patients was significantly higher than that of healthy controls, both AF intensity and AF asymmetry of these four groups were markedly lower than those of the AIS patients, which have shown promise for AIS diagnosis. Several lines of evidence have indicated K1 as an origin of the AF, e.g., K1 siRNA administration attenuated the oxidative stress-induced AF increase of mice. Collectively, our study has indicated K1-based epidermal AF as a biomarker for non-invasive evaluation of the levels of inflammation and oxidative stress in the body. These findings have established a basis for novel keratins AF-based biomedical imaging technology for non-invasive, efficient and economic diagnosis and screening of such inflammation- and oxidative stress-associated diseases as AIS.",

    "abstract": "The N(6)-threonylcarbamoyl adenosine (t6A) modification at position 37 of a tRNA of the anticodon loop is universal and central to the translational fidelity of all known organisms. The ternary complex of TsaBDE is the central and essential workstation for t6A biosynthesis in bacteria. The recently published crystal structure of Thermotoga maritima (T.maritima) TsaBDE complex (Missoury et al., 2018) has ~15% incorrectly-placed, misplaced/mistraced, or missing residues. These structural errors have precipitated incorrect conclusions about the disordering of the active site and inferred action of the TsaE element. In this report, we rectify the published structural model of the T.maritima TsaBDE complex. In stark contrast, a corrected structural model of TsaBDE shows that both active sites of the TsaD element are fully occupied with threonylcarbamoyladenosine (TC-AMP), an unstable intermediate chemical moiety of the t6A biosynthesis pathway. This observation has profound implications for understanding the funneling of intermediates in the t6A pathway and also in helping to elucidate tRNA binding modes. Based on the structural details described in here we propose a unifying principle for binding the tRNA to the TsaD subunit of the complex which is universally required in all known t6A modification pathways.",

    "abstract": "Population monitoring is key to wildlife conservation and management but is challenging at the spatial and temporal extents necessary for understanding changes. Non-invasive survey methods and spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models have revolutionized wildlife monitoring by providing the means to more easily acquire data at large scales and the framework to generate spatially-explicit predictions, respectively. Despite the opportunities for improved monitoring, challenges can remain in the study design and model fitting phases of an SCR approach. Here, we used a search-encounter design with multi-session SCR models to collect spatially-indexed photographs and estimate the changes in density of cheetahs between 2005 and 2013-2016 in the Masai Mara National Reserve (MMNR) in southwestern Kenya. Our SCR models of cheetah encounters suggested little change in cheetah density from 2005 to 2013-2016, though there was some evidence that density fluctuated annually in the MMNR. The sampling period length (5 vs. 10 months) and timing (early, late, full year) over which spatial encounters were included in the modeling did not substantially alter inferences about density when sample sizes were adequate (>20 spatially distinct encounters). We estimated an average cheetah density of ~1.2 cheetahs/100 km2, consistent with the impression that the MMNR provides important habitat for cheetahs in Africa. During most years and seasonal periods, the spatial distribution of vegetation greenness (a proxy for ungulate habitat quality) accounted for important variation in encounter rates. The search-encounter design used here could be applied to other regions for the purposes of cheetah monitoring. While snap-shot estimates of population size across time are useful for wildlife monitoring, open population models could identify the mechanisms behind changes and further facilitate better conservation and management decision making.",

    "abstract": "Background and AimsSouthern Arabia is a global biodiversity hotspot with a high proportion of endemic desert-adapted plants. Here we examine evidence for a Pleistocene climate refugium in the southern Central Desert of Oman, and its role in driving biogeographical patterns of endemism.\n\nMethodsDistribution data for seven narrow-range endemic plants were collected systematically across 195 quadrats, together with incidental and historic records. Important environmental variables relevant to arid coastal areas, including night time fog and cloud cover were developed for the study area. Environmental niche models were built and tuned for each species and spatial overlap examined.\n\nKey ResultsA region of the Jiddat Al Arkad reported independent high model suitability for all species. Examination of environmental data across southern Oman indicates that the Jiddat Al Arkad displays a regionally unique climate with higher intra-annual stability, due in part to the influence of the southern monsoon. Despite this, relative importance of environmental variables was highly differentiated among species, suggesting characteristic variables such as coastal fog are not major cross-species predictors at this scale.\n\nConclusionsThe co-occurrence of a high number of endemic study species within a narrow monsoon-influenced region is indicative of a refugium with low climate change velocity. Combined with climate analysis, our findings provide strong evidence for a southern Arabian Pleistocene refugium in the Omans Central Desert. We suggest this refugium has acted as an isolated temperate and mesic island in the desert, resulting in the evolution of these narrow-range endemic flora. Based on the composition of species, this system may represent the northernmost remnant of a continuous belt of mesic vegetation formerly ranging from Africa to Asia, with close links to the flora of East Africa. This has significant implications for future conservation of endemic plants in an arid biodiversity hotspot.",

Rarely, however, have within-host models been synthesized with data to infer processes, validate hypotheses, or generate new theories. In this study we use mechanistic models and empirical, time-series data of viral titer to better understand the growth of ranaviruses within their amphibian hosts and the immune dynamics that limit viral replication. Specifically, we fit a suite of potential models to our data, where each model represents a hypothesis about the interactions between viral growth and immune defense. Through formal model comparison, we find a parsimonious model that captures key features of our time-series data: the viral titer rises and falls through time, likely due to an immune system response, and that the initial viral dosage affects both the peak viral titer and the timing of the peak. Importantly, our model makes several predictions, including the existence of long-term viral infections, that can be validated in future studies.",

    "abstract": "Local adaptation across species range is widespread. Yet, much has to be discovered on its environmental drivers, the underlying functional traits and their molecular determinants. Because elevation gradients display continuous environmental changes at a short geographical scale, they provide an exceptional opportunity to investigate these questions. Here, we used two common gardens to phenotype 1664 plants from 11 populations of annual teosintes. These populations were sampled across two elevation gradients in Mexico. Our results point to a syndrome of adaptation to altitude with the production of offspring that flowered earlier, produced less tillers, and larger, longer and heavier grains with increasing elevation. We genotyped these plants for 178 outlier single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which had been chosen because they displayed excess of allele differentiation and/or correlation with environmental variables in six populations with contrasted altitudes. A high proportion of outlier SNPs associated with the phenotypic variation of at least one trait. We tested phenotypic pairwise correlations between traits, and found that the higher the correlation, the greater the number of common associated SNPs. In addition, allele frequencies at 87 of the outlier SNPs correlated with an environmental component best summarized by altitudinal variation on a broad sample of 28 populations. Chromosomal inversions were enriched for both phenotypically-associated and environmentally-correlated SNPs. Altogether, our results are consistent with the set-up of an altitudinal syndrome promoted by local adaptation of teosinte populations in the face of gene flow. We showed that pleiotropy is pervasive and potentially has constrained the evolution of traits. Finally, we recovered variants underlying phenotypic variation at adaptive traits. Because elevation mimics climate change through space, these variants may be relevant for future maize breeding.\n\nAuthor summaryAcross their native range, species encounter a diversity of habitats promoting local adaptation of geographically distributed populations. While local adaptation is widespread, much has yet to be discovered about the conditions of its emergence, the targeted traits, their molecular determinants and the underlying ecological drivers. Here we employed a reverse ecology approach, combining phenotypes and genotypes, to mine the determinants of local adaptation of teosinte populations distributed along two steep altitudinal gradients in Mexico. Evaluation of 11 populations in two common gardens located at mid-elevation pointed to the set-up of an altitudinal syndrome, in spite of gene flow. We scanned genomes to identify loci with allele frequencies shifts along elevation. Interestingly, variation at these loci was commonly associated to variation of phenotypes. Because elevation mimics climate change through space, these variants may be relevant for future maize breeding.",

To understand more about these changes, we analyzed the transcriptome and translatome of C. elegans subjected to dietary restriction. Transcription of muscle regulatory and structural genes increased, while increased expression of amino acid metabolism and neuropeptide signaling genes was controlled at the level of translation. Evaluation of post-transcriptional regulation identified putative roles for RNA binding proteins, RNA editing, microRNA, alternative splicing, and nonsense mediated decay in response to nutrient limitation. Using RNA interference, we discovered several differentially expressed genes that regulate lifespan. We also found a compensatory role for translational regulation, which offsets dampened expression of a large subset of transcriptionally downregulated genes. Furthermore, 3 UTR editing and intron retention increase under dietary restriction and correlate with diminished translation, while trans-spliced genes are refractory to reduced translation efficiency compared to messages with the native 5 UTR. Finally, we find that smg-6 and smg-7, which are genes governing selection and turnover of nonsense mediated decay targets, are required for increased lifespan under dietary restriction.",

We have applied a combination of whole genome sequencing and optical genome mapping to a number of adult and pediatric leukemia samples, which revealed in each of these samples a large number of structural variants not recognizable by current tools of genomic analyses. We developed computational methods to determine which of those variants likely arose as somatic mutations. The method identified 97% of the structural variants previously reported by karyotype analysis of these samples and revealed an additional fivefold more such somatic rearrangements. The method identified on average tens of previously unrecognizable inversions and duplications and hundreds of previously unrecognizable insertions and deletions. These structural variants recurrently affected a number of leukemia associated genes as well as cancer driver genes not previously associated with leukemia and genes not previously associated with cancer. A number of variants only affected intergenic regions but caused cis-acting alterations in expression of neighboring genes. Analysis of TCGA data indicates that the status of several of the recurrently mutated genes identified in this study significantly affect survival of AML patients. Our results suggest that current genomic analysis methods fail to identify a majority of structural variants in leukemia samples and this lacunae may hamper diagnostic and prognostic efforts.",

Here, we introduce Slide-seq, a highly scalable method that enables facile generation of large volumes of unbiased spatial transcriptomes with 10 {micro}m spatial resolution, comparable to the size of individual cells. In Slide-seq, RNA is transferred from freshly frozen tissue sections onto a surface covered in DNA-barcoded beads with known positions, allowing the spatial locations of the RNA to be inferred by sequencing. To demonstrate Slide-seqs utility, we localized cell types identified by large-scale scRNA-seq datasets within the cerebellum and hippocampus. We next systematically characterized spatial gene expression patterns in the Purkinje layer of mouse cerebellum, identifying new axes of variation across Purkinje cell compartments. Finally, we used Slide-seq to define the temporal evolution of cell-type-specific responses in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury. Slide-seq will accelerate biological discovery by enabling routine, high-resolution spatial mapping of gene expression.\n\nOne Sentence SummarySlide-seq measures genome-wide expression in complex tissues at 10-micron resolution.",

    "abstract": "Linking the genomic content of uncultivated microbes to their metabolic functions remains a critical challenge in microbial ecology. Resolving this challenge has implications for improving our management of key microbial interactions in biotechnologies such as anaerobic digestion, which relies on slow-growing syntrophic and methanogenic communities to produce renewable methane from organic waste. In this study, we combined DNA stable isotope probing (SIP) with genome-centric metagenomics to recover the genomes of populations enriched in 13C after feeding 13C-labeled butyrate. Differential abundance analysis on recovered genomic bins across the SIP metagenomes identified two metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) that were significantly enriched in the heavy 13C DNA. Phylogenomic analysis assigned one MAG to the genus Syntrophomonas, and the other MAG to the genus Methanothrix. Metabolic reconstruction of the annotated genomes showed that the Syntrophomonas genome encoded all the enzymes for beta-oxidizing butyrate, as well as several mechanisms for interspecies electron transfer via electron transfer flavoproteins, hydrogenases, and formate dehydrogenases. The Syntrophomonas genome shared low average nucleotide identity (< 95%) with any cultured representative species, indicating it is a novel species that plays a significant role in syntrophic butyrate degradation within anaerobic digesters. The Methanothrix genome contained the complete pathway for aceticlastic methanogenesis, indicating that it was enriched in 13C from syntrophic acetate transfer. This study demonstrates the potential of stable-isotope-informed genome-resolved metagenomics to elucidate the nature of metabolic cooperation in slow-growing uncultured microbial populations, such as syntrophic bacteria and methanogens, that are important to waste treatment as well as global carbon cycling.\n\nImportancePredicting the metabolic potential and ecophysiology of mixed microbial communities remains a major challenge, especially for slow-growing anaerobes that are difficult to isolate. Unraveling the in-situ metabolic activities of uncultured species could enable a more descriptive framework to model substrate transformations by microbiomes, which has broad implications for advancing the fields of biotechnology, global biogeochemistry, and human health. Here, we investigated the in-situ function of mixed microbiomes by combining DNA-stable isotope probing with metagenomics to identify the genomes of active syntrophic populations converting butyrate, a C4 fatty acid, into methane within anaerobic digesters. This approach thus moves beyond the mere presence of metabolic genes to resolve  who is doing what by obtaining confirmatory assimilation of labeled substrate into the DNA signature. Our findings provide a framework to further link the genomic identities of uncultured microbes with their ecological function within microbiomes driving many important biotechnological and global processes.",

    "abstract": "Trabulsiella guamensis is a non-pathogenic enterobacterium that was isolated from a vacuum cleaner on the island of Guam. It has one H2-oxidizing Hyd-2-type hydrogenase (Hyd), and encodes a H2-evolving Hyd that is most similar to the uncharacterized Escherichia coli formate hydrogenlyase (FHL-2Ec) complex. The FHL-2Tg complex is predicted to have 5 membrane-integral and between 4-5 cytoplasmic subunits. We could show that FHL-2Tg complex catalyses the disproportionation of formate to CO2 and H2. FHL-2Tg has an activity similar to the E. coli FHL-1Ec complex in H2-evolution from formate, but the complex appears more labile upon cell lysis. Cloning of the entire 13 kbp FHL-2Tg operon in the heterologous E. coli host has now enabled us to prove FHL-2Tg activity unambiguously and allowed us to characterize the FHL-2Tg complex biochemically. Although the formate dehydrogenase (FdhH) gene fdhF is not encoded in the operon, the FdhH is part of the complex and FHL-2Tg activity was dependent on the presence of E. coli FdhH. Also, in contrast to E. coli, T. guamensis can ferment the alternative carbon source cellobiose, and we further investigated the participation of both the H2-oxidizing Hyd-2Tg and the H2-forming FHL-2Tg under these conditions.\n\nImportanceBiological H2-production presents an attractive alternative for fossil fuels. But in order to compete with conventional H2-production methods, the process requires our understanding on the molecular level. FHL complexes are efficient H2-producers and the prototype FHL-1Ec complex in E. coli is well studied. This paper presents the first biochemical characterisation of an FHL-2-type complex. The data presented here will enable us to solve the long-standing mystery of the FHL-2Ec complex, allow a first biochemical characterisation of T. guamensiss fermentative metabolism and establish this enterobacterium as model organism for FHL-dependent energy conservation.",

Our limited understanding of this ubiquitous environmental microorganism matched with its intrinsic resistance to most classes of antibiotic, including {beta}-lactams, has left us with an urgent demand for new, more effective therapeutic interventions. De novo antimicrobial drug discovery is a lengthy process and so we have taken the approach of repurposing known antibiotics in order to provide a rapidly implementable solution to a current problem. Here we report a significant step forward in treatment potential for M. abscessus infection by sensitising the organism to the broad spectrum {beta}-lactam antibiotic, amoxicillin, using the non-competitive {beta}-lactamase inhibitor, relebactam. We demonstrate by disk diffusion and broth microdilution assay that this combination works synergistically to inhibit M. abscessus. We also demonstrate the direct non-competitive inhibition of the M. abscessus {beta}-lactamase, BlaMab using a novel thin-layer chromatography-based assay for {beta}-lactamase inhibition, which is subsequently kinetically validated by spectrophotometric assay using the nitrocefin reporter assay. Finally, we demonstrate the in vitro efficacy of this combination against a collection of M. abscessus clinical isolates, demonstrating the significant therapeutic potential of the amoxicillin and relebactam combination.",

It is unclear how the parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, triggers these processes. Extracellular histones, released from damaged host cells, bind to cell membranes and cause coagulation activation, platelet aggregation and vascular leak in diverse critical illnesses. In CM patients with P. falciparum, serum histones correlate with fibrin formation, thrombocytopenia, and endothelial activation and predict brain swelling on magnetic resonance imaging and fatal outcome. Post-mortem, histones bind to the luminal vascular surface, co-localizing with P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IE), and with thrombosis and leak. Purified P. falciparum histones cause toxicity and barrier disruption in cultured human brain microvascular endothelial cells, as does serum from CM patients, reversed by anti-histone antibodies and non-anticoagulant heparin. These data implicate parasite histones as a key trigger of fatal brain swelling in CM.

Sputum samples were taken weekly for the first 12 weeks of treatment and evaluated by MBLA and mycobacterial growth indicator tube method (MGIT).\n\nResultsThe results of high and low positive control samples confirmed inter site reproducibility. Over the 12 weeks of treatment there was a steady decline in the viable bacterial load as measured by the MBLA that corresponds to rise in time to a positive result (TTP) in the Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube. Both MBLA and MGIT provided similar time to test negativity. Importantly, as treatment progressed samples in MGIT were increasingly likely to be contaminated, which compromised the acquisition of results but did not affect MBLA samples.\n\nConclusionsMBLA produces a reproducible measure of Mtb viable count comparable to that of MGIT that is not compromised by contamination in a real-world setting.

    "abstract": "Despite a long history of genetic manipulation of Bacillus subtilis using auxotrophic markers in genetic manipulation, the genes involved in alanine metabolism have not been characterised fully. Here we show that B. subtilis expresses an alanine uptake permease, YtnA (DatA), that has a major role in the assimilation of D-alanine from the environment. Since this isomer of the amino acid is not normally abundant it likely source is form the cells own cell wall probably through the action of carboxypeptidases and/or the spontaneous release of D-alanine from the teichoic acids. Also in this work we clarify the synthetic pathways acting in the biosynthesis of alanine. Genetically we show that, unlike E. coli where multiple enzymes have a biochemical activity that can generate alanine, in B. subtilis the primary synthetic enzyme for alanine is encoded by alaT, although a second gene, dat, is present that can support slow growth of an alanine auxotroph however our data suggests that this enzyme probably synthesises D-alanine. In summary this work has provided an explanation of the observation that growth of B. subtilis is linked with an efficient recycling system for D-alanine that is released from the cell as the cell envelope is processed to permit cell enlargement. The results also suggest that the relative abundance of D- and L-alanine that might be linked with cytosolic pool of D and L-glutamate, and so enabling tight coupling protein and cell envelope synthesis with the metabolic status of the cell.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities associated with the gut and the skin are strongly influenced by environmental factors, and can rapidly adapt to change. Historical processes may also affect the microbiome. In particular, variation in microbial colonisation in early life has the potential to induce lasting effects on microbial assemblages. However, little is known about the relative extent of microbiome plasticity or the importance of historical colonisation effects following environmental change, especially for non-mammalian species. To investigate this we performed a reciprocal translocation of Atlantic salmon between captive and semi-natural conditions. Wild and hatchery-reared fry were transferred to three common garden experimental environments for six weeks: standard hatchery conditions, hatchery conditions with an enriched diet, and simulated wild conditions. We characterised the faecal and skin microbiome of individual fish before and after the environmental translocation, using a BACI (before-after-control-impact) design. We found evidence of extensive plasticity in both gut and skin microbiota, with the greatest changes in alpha and beta diversity associated with the largest changes in environment and diet. Microbiome richness and diversity were entirely determined by environment, with no detectable historical effects of fish origin. Microbiome structure was also strongly influenced by current environmental conditions but, for the first time in fish, we also found evidence of colonisation history, including a number of OTUs characteristic of captive rearing. These results may have important implications for host adaptation to local selective pressures, and also highlight how conditions during early life can have a long-term influence on the microbiome and, potentially, host health.",

    "abstract": "Variation in gene expression among genetically identical individual cells (called gene expression noise) directly contributes to phenotypic diversity. Whether such variation can impact genome stability and lead to variation in genotype remains poorly explored. We addressed this question by investigating whether noise in the expression of genes affecting homologous recombination (HR) activity either directly (RAD52) or indirectly (RAD27) confers cell-to-cell heterogeneity in HR rate in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using cell sorting to isolate subpopulations with various expression levels, we show that spontaneous HR rate is highly heterogeneous from cell-to-cell in clonal populations depending on the cellular amount of proteins affecting HR activity. Phleomycin-induced HR is even more heterogeneous, showing that RAD27 expression noise strongly affects the rate of recombination from cell-to-cell. Strong variations in HR rate between subpopulations are not correlated to strong changes in cell cycle stage. Moreover, this heterogeneity occurs even when simultaneously sorting cells at equal expression level of another gene involved in DNA damage response (BMH1) that is upregulated by DNA damage, showing that the initiating DNA damage is not responsible for the observed heterogeneity in HR rate. Thus gene expression noise seems mainly responsible for this phenomenon. Finally, HR rate non-linearly scales with Rad27 levels showing that total amount of HR cannot be explained solely by the time- or population-averaged Rad27 expression. Altogether, our data reveal interplay between heterogeneity at the gene expression and genetic levels in the production of phenotypic diversity with evolutionary consequences from microbial to cancer cell populations.",

    "abstract": "Ticks are second only to mosquitoes as vectors of disease to humans and animals. Commercial insect repellents reduce or prevent potentially infectious tick bites by disrupting tick host-seeking behavior. Tick host-seeking is mainly ascribed to the Hallers organ, a complex sensory structure on the tick foreleg that detects odors, carbon dioxide and heat 4-7, but these host-seeking mechanisms and the mechanism of their disruption by repellents are not well understood1,2. There is anecdotal evidence that ticks and other ectoparasites are attracted to heat, but it has never been demonstrated that they use radiant heat to detect hosts at a distance. In fact, previous attempts to do this have concluded that radiant heat is not used by ticks. Here we show that Amblyomma americanum and Dermacentor variabilis ticks can sense and home in on a human from several meters away, guided by radiant heat sensed by the Hallers organ, and specifically the capsule, a covered spherical pit organ. An aperture in the capsule cover confers directionality and highly reflective interior surfaces of the capsule provide high sensitivity. Low concentrations of the insect repellents DEET, picaridin, 2-undecanone, citronellal and nootkatone eliminate thermotaxis without affecting olfactory-stimulated host-seeking behavior. Our results demonstrate that the tick Hallers organ capsule is a radiant heat sensor used in host-finding and that repellents disrupt this sense at concentrations that do not disrupt olfaction. We anticipate this discovery to significantly aid insect repellent research and development of innovative strategies for protection against ectoparasites and vector-borne disease.",

    "abstract": "Sleep spindles are generated in thalamocortical, corticothalamic and possibly cortico-cortical circuits. Previous hypotheses suggested that slow and fast spindles or spindles with various spatial extent may be generated in different circuits with various cortical laminar innervation patterns. We used NREM sleep EEG data recorded from four human epileptic patients undergoing presurgical electrophysiological monitoring with subdural electrocorticographic grids (ECoG) and implanted laminar microelectrodes penetrating the cortex (IME). The position of IME electrodes within cortical layers was confirmed using postsurgical histological reconstructions. Many micro-domain spindles detected on the IME occurred only in one layer and were absent from the ECoG, but with increasing amplitude simultaneous detection in other layers and on the ECoG became more likely. Macro-domain spindles sufficiently large to be detected on the ECoG were in contrast usually accompanied by IME spindles. Neither micro-domain nor macro-domain spindle cortical profiles were strongly associated with sleep spindle frequency or globality. Multiple-unit and single-unit activity during spindles, however, was heterogeneous across spindle types, but also across layers and subjects. Our results indicate that extremely local spindles may occur in any cortical layer, but co-occurrence at other locations becomes likelier with increasing amplitude and the relatively large spindles detected on ECoG channels have a stereotypical laminar profile. We found no compelling evidence that different spindle types are associated with different laminar profiles, suggesting that they are generated in cortical and thalamic circuits with similar cortical innervation patterns. Local neuronal activity is a stronger candidate mechanism for driving functional differences between spindles subtypes.",

    "abstract": "Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) generates 3D datasets optimally suited for segmentation of cell ultrastructure and automated connectome tracing but is limited to small fields of view and is therefore incompatible with the new generation of ultrafast multibeam SEMs. In contrast, section-based techniques are multibeam-compatible but are limited in z-resolution making automatic segmentation of cellular ultrastructure difficult. Here we demonstrate a novel 3D electron microscopy technique, Gas Cluster Ion Beam SEM (GCIB-SEM), in which top-down, wide-area ion milling is performed on a series of thick sections, acquiring < 10 nm isotropic datasets of each which are then stitched together to span the full sectioned volume. Based on our results, incorporating GCIB-SEM into existing single beam and multibeam SEM workflows should be straightforward and should dramatically increase reliability while simultaneously improving z-resolution by a factor of 3 or more.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, I analyze the hypothesis that hippocampal neurogenesis (HN) exerts its effects on behavior via activation of inhibitory circuits in the hippocampus. Using a very simple mathematical model (half-borrowed from biochemistry) to aid the reasoning, I show that the key factors determining the magnitude of HNs effects on behavior are: the baseline levels of HN in the animal, the efficiency of the animals inhibitory circuits, the strength/intensity of the stimulus presented to the animal and how much accuracy the behavioral task requires from the information contained in the hippocampal representations. Taken together, those factors can help explain patterns observed in the behavioral results for memory, pattern separation and anxiety. The conclusions of the analysis suggest that HNs effects on inhibitory circuits can explain the impact of neurogenesis in both emotion and cognition and provide a framework to interpret future studies with rodents and possibly with other species as well.",

    "abstract": "The combination of diffusion MRI with microscopy provides unique opportunities to study microstructural features of tissue, particularly when acquired in the same sample. Microscopy is frequently used to validate diffusion MRI microstructure models, addressing the indirect nature of dMRI signals. Typically, these modalities are analysed separately, and microscopy is taken as a gold standard against which dMRI-derived parameters are validated. Here we propose an alternative approach in which we combine diffusion MRI and microscopy data obtained from the same tissue sample to drive a single, joint model. This simultaneous analysis allows us to take advantage of the breadth of information provided by complementary data acquired from different modalities. By applying this framework to a spherical-deconvolution analysis, we are able to overcome a known degeneracy between fibre dispersion and radial diffusion. Spherical-deconvolution based approaches typically estimate a global fibre response function to determine the fibre orientation distribution in each voxel. However, the assumption of a  brain-wide fibre response function may be challenged if the diffusion characteristics of white matter vary across the brain. Using a generative joint dMRI-histology model, we demonstrate that the fibre response function is dependent on local anatomy, and that current spherical-deconvolution based models may be overestimating dispersion and underestimating the number of distinct fibre populations per voxel.",

Complex approaches to this challenge such as Bayesian inference are accurate but cognitively demanding, requiring extensive working memory and adaptive learning. Simple strategies such as always using a prior bias or following the last observation are easy to implement but may be less accurate. What is the appropriate balance between complexity and accuracy? We construct a hierarchy of strategies that vary in complexity between these limits and find a power law of diminishing returns: increasing complexity gives progressively smaller gains in accuracy. Moreover, the rate at which the gain decrements depends systematically on the statistical uncertainty in the world, such that complex strategies do not provide substantial benefits over simple ones when uncertainty is too high or too low.

In humans, it is seen as suppression of the EEG-based N1 event-related potential, with less N1-suppression seen in people with schizophrenia and those at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis. Because N1 is an admixture of theta (4-7Hz) power and phase synchrony, we asked which is responsible for N1 effects and if they outperform the sensitivity of N1 to corollary discharge and schizophrenia.\n\nMethodsTheta phase and power values were extracted from EEG data acquired from CHR youth (n=71), early illness schizophrenia patients (ESZ; n=84), and healthy controls (HC; n=103) as they said /ah/ (Talk) and then listened to the sounds played back (Listen). A principal components analysis extracted theta inter-trial coherence (ITC; phase consistency) and event related spectral power, peaking in the N1 latency range.\n\nResultsTheta ITC-suppression (Cohen d=1.46) was greater than N1-suppression in HC (Cohen d=.63). Both were both reduced in ESZ, but only N1-suppression was reduced in CHR. When deprived of the variance shared with theta-ITC suppression, N1-suppression was no longer sensitive to HC vs. ESZ or HC vs. CHR group differences. Deficits in theta ITC-suppression were correlated with delusions (p=.007) in ESZ. Suppression of theta power was not affected by Group.\n\nConclusionsTheta ITC-suppression may provide a simpler assay of the corollary discharge mechanism than N1-suppression. Deficits in circuits that generate low frequency oscillations may be an important component of schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Summary statementFbxo7 is the substrate-recognition subunit of an SCF-type ubiquitin E3 ligase complex. It has physiologically important functions in regulating mitophagy, proteasome activity and the cell cycle in multiple cell types, like neurons, lymphocytes and erythrocytes. Here we show that in addition to the previously-known Parkinsonian and haematopoietic phenotypes, Fbxo7-deficient male mice are completely sterile. In these males, despite successful meiosis, nuclear elongation and eviction of histones from chromatin, the developing spermatids are phagocytosed by Sertoli cells during late spermiogenesis, as the cells undergo cytoplasmic remodelling. Surprisingly, despite the loss of all germ cells, there was no evidence of the symplast formation and cell sloughing that is typically associated with spermatid death in other mouse sterility models, suggesting that novel cell death and/or cell disposal mechanisms may be engaged in Fbxo7-deficient males. Mutation of the Drosophila Fbxo7 orthologue, nutcracker (ntc) was previously shown to cause sterility at a similar stage of germ cell development, indicating that the requirement for Fbxo7 is conserved. The ntc phenotype was attributed to proteasome mis-regulation via an interaction with the proteasome regulator, DmPI31. Our data suggest rather that in mice, the requirement for Fbxo7 is either independent of its interaction with PI31, or relates specifically to cytoplasmic proteasome activity during spermiogenesis.",

However, non-systematic collection data must be treated carefully if they are to approximate abundance, as trends may be confounded with spatial or temporal changes in sampling effort. Boyle et al. (2019b) argue that the relative abundance of Eastern North American Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) has been in a long-term decline since the mid-20th century, following a similar decline in milkweed (Asclepias spp.) herbarium records. I demonstrate that this reported abundance trend is biased by the choice to standardize Monarch records as a proportion of all Lepidoptera collected. The sampling of Lepidoptera has changed systematically over time to favor moths, causing the apparent trend in Monarch records. With the data standardized more appropriately, I show that the trend in Monarch records shows no mid-century decline and increases over recent decades. As the trend in Monarch museum specimens contradicts the recent trend in Monarch abundance documented from systematic population monitoring, I argue that these records are unreliable for abundance estimates. The conclusion in Boyle et al. (2019b) that Monarch declines started in the mid-20th century is unwarranted both because the trend is biased by sampling changes in museum records and because the trend in Monarch records, when corrected, does not correspond with real-world population abundance.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMetabolic network analysis through flux balance is an established method for the computational redesign of production strains in metabolic engineering. The computational redesign is often based on reaction deletions from the original wild type networks. A key principle often used in this method is the production of target metabolites as by-products of cell growth. From a viewpoint of bioinformatics, it is very important to prepare a set of algorithms that can determine reaction deletions that achieve growth coupling whatever network topologies, target metabolites and parameter values will be considered in the future. Recently, the strong coupling-based method was used to demonstrate that the coupling of growth and production is possible for nearly all metabolites through reaction deletions in genome-scale metabolic models of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae under aerobic conditions. However, when growing S. cerevisiae under anaerobic conditions, deletion strategies using the strong coupling-based method were possible for only 3.9% of all metabolites. Therefore, it is necessary to develop algorithms that can achieve growth coupling by reaction deletions for the conditions that the strong coupling-based method was not efficient.\n\nResultsWe developed an algorithm that could calculate the reaction deletions that achieve the coupling of growth and production for 91.3% metabolites in genome-scale models of S. cerevisiae under anaerobic conditions. This analysis was conducted for the worst-case-scenario using flux variability analysis. To demonstrate the feasibility of the coupling, we derived appropriate reaction deletions using the new algorithm for target production in which the search space was divided into small cubes (CubeProd).\n\nConclusionsWe developed a novel algorithm, CubeProd, to demonstrate that growth coupling is possible for most metabolites in S.cerevisiae under anaerobic conditions. This may imply that growth coupling is possible by reaction deletions for most target metabolites in any genome-scale constraint-based metabolic networks. The developed software, CubeProd, implemented in MATLAB, and the obtained reaction deletion strategies are freely available.",

    "abstract": "The repeatability of adaptive radiation is expected to be scale dependent, with determinism decreasing as greater spatial separation among \"replicates\" leads to their increased genetic and ecological independence. Threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) provide an opportunity to test whether this expectation holds for the early stages of adaptive radiation - their diversification in freshwater ecosystems has been replicated many times. To better understand the repeatability of that adaptive radiation, we examined the influence of geographic scale on levels of parallel evolution by quantifying phenotypic and genetic divergence between lake and stream stickleback pairs sampled at regional (Vancouver Island) and global (North America and Europe) scales. We measured phenotypes known to show lake-stream divergence and used reduced representation genome-wide sequencing to estimate genetic divergence. We assessed the scale-dependence of parallel evolution by comparing effect sizes from multivariate models and also the direction and magnitude of lake-stream divergence vectors. At the phenotypic level, parallelism was greater at the regional than the global scale. At the genetic level, putative selected loci showed greater lake-stream parallelism at the regional than the global scale. Generally, the level of parallel evolution was low at both scales, except for some key univariate traits. Divergence vectors were often orthogonal, highlighting possible ecological and genetic constraints on parallel evolution at both scales. Overall, our results confirm that the repeatability of adaptive radiation decreases at increasing spatial scales. We suggest that greater environmental heterogeneity at larger scales imposes different selection regimes, thus generating lower repeatability of adaptive radiation at larger spatial scales.",

    "abstract": "Haplotypes defined by rs7041/rs4588 in GC gene modulate 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) levels. To investigate the distributions of GC polymorphisms, the rs7041 and rs4588 allele and haplotypes frequencies were analyzed in samples from different Eurasian regions. The GC1S haplotype associated with high level of serum 25(OH)D had the maximum frequency in European populations (except Finish population). Such frequency distributions may be a result of adaptation to low solar insolation rate. Besides, there was a strong trend of increasing GC1F haplotype frequency from Europe (10-15%) to Siberia and Easter Asia (40-45%).",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCryptosporidium is an emerging opportunistic zoonotic pathogen that causes diarrheal illness in a wide range of hosts including livestock and humans. Globally there is exponential increase in livestock production to meet the worlds demand for animal protein as well as for financial reasons. However, there is raised concern of the public health threat due to contamination of the environment by livestock waste carrying zoonotic pathogens such as Cryptosporidium. This study set out to establish the prevalence of Cryptosporidium as well as the circulating genotypes in order to elucidate the potential role of cattle in the spread of human cryptosporidiosis. We collected rectal coprological samples from 363 cattle in 11 households in Kiruhura district, Southwestern Uganda. The samples were screened for presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts using the phenol auramine staining method followed by fluorescent microscopy. DNA was then extracted from the microscopy positive samples and the COWP gene amplified using PCR. Amplified gene products were sequenced and subjected to phylogenetic analysis.\n\nResultsThe overall animal level prevalence of Cryptosporidium was 7.7% (95% CI: 5.1-10.9), and herd level prevalence was 33.3% (95% CI: 18.5-52.2). We found a statistically significant difference (p=0.02) between infection in bulls as compared to cows. There was however no significant difference in the prevalence among the different cattle breeds sampled, with the following prevalences observed in Crosses 9.2%, Ankole 5.7%, Friesian 7.1%, and Boran 2.8% respectively. The COWP gene was successfully amplified from 20 of the 28 microscopy positive samples. All the sequenced DNA amplicons were confirmed to be C. hominis, with 98%-100% identity to sequences in the GenBank. C. hominis was the only genotype isolated from this study, further asserting that cattle could be a potential high risk source of human cryptosporidiosis.\n\nConclusionThis study represents the first time naturally occurring C. hominis has been isolated from cattle in Uganda. This further provides evidence of cattle possibly being biological reservoirs for C. hominis and cattle could be a potential high risk source of human cryptosporidiosis.",

    "abstract": "Could nose-to-brain pathways mediate the effects of peptides such as oxytocin (OT) on brain physiology when delivered intranasally? We address this question by contrasting two methods of intranasal administration (a standard nasal spray, and a nebulizer expected to improve OT deposition in nasal areas putatively involved in direct nose-to-brain transport) to intravenous administration in terms of effects on regional cerebral blood flow during two hours post-dosing. We demonstrate that OT-induced decreases in amygdala perfusion, a key hub of the OT central circuitry, are explained entirely by OT increases in systemic circulation following both intranasal and intravenous OT administration. Yet we also provide robust evidence confirming the validity of the intranasal route to target specific brain regions. Our work has important translational implications and demonstrates the need to carefully consider the method of administration in our efforts to engage specific central oxytocinergic targets for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "People sometimes anticipate specific words during language comprehension. Consistent with word anticipation, pre-nominal articles elicit differential neural activity when they mismatch the gender of a predictable noun compared with when they match. However, the functional significance of this pre-nominal effect is unclear: Do people only predict the noun or do they predict the entire article-noun combination? We addressed this question in an event-related potential study (N=48) with pre-registered data acquisition and analyses, capitalizing on gender-marking on Dutch definite articles and the lack thereof on indefinite articles. Participants read mini-story contexts that strongly suggested either a definite or indefinite noun phrase (e.g.,  het/een boek, the/a book) as its best continuation, followed by a definite noun phrase with the expected noun or an unexpected, different gender noun ( het boek/de roman, the book/the novel). We observed an enhanced negativity (N400) for articles that were unexpectedly definite or mismatched the expected gender, with the former effect being strongest. Pre-registered analyses and exploratory Bayesian analyses did not yield convincing evidence that the effect of gender-mismatch depended on expected definiteness. While prediction of article form cannot be excluded, it may not be required to elicit pre-nominal effects.",

    "abstract": "Endogenous processes allow the maintenance of working memories. These processes presumably involve prefrontal networks with strong recurrent connections. Distractors evoke a morphing of the population code, even when memories are stable. But it is unclear whether these dynamic population responses contain stable memory information. Here we show that dynamic prefrontal activity contains stable memory information, and the stability depends on parallel movement of trajectories associated with different memories in state space. We used an optimization algorithm to find a subspace with stable memory information. In correct trials the stability extended to periods that were not used to find the subspace, but in error trials the information and the stability were reduced. A bump attractor model was able to replicate these behaviors. The model provided predictions that could be confirmed with the neural data. We conclude that downstream regions could read memory information from a stable subspace.",

    "abstract": "Modeling studies predict that transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) entrains brain oscillations, yet direct examination has been lacking or potentially contaminated by stimulation artefact. Here we first demonstrate how the posterior parietal cortex drives primary visual cortex and thalamic LP in the alpha-band in head-fixed awake ferrets. The spike-field synchrony is maximum within alpha frequency, and more prominent for narrow-spiking neurons than broad-spiking ones. Guided by a validated model of electric field distribution, we produced electric fields comparable to those in humans and primates (< 0.5 mV/mm). We found evidence to support the model-driven predictions of how tACS entrains neural oscillations as explained by the triangular Arnold tongue pattern. In agreement with the stronger spike-field coupling of narrow-spiking cells, tACS more strongly entrained this cell population. Our findings provide the first in vivo evidence of how tACS with electric field amplitudes used in human studies entrains neuronal oscillators.",

    "abstract": "The ever growing obesity epidemic has created a need to develop a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms responsible for this condition. Appetite and consumption are directly influenced by the taste system which determines if potential food items will be ingested or rejected. While previous studies have reported that obese individuals have reduced taste perception, the relationship between these processes is still poorly understood. Earlier work has demonstrated that diet-induced obesity (DIO) directly impairs taste responses, particularly for sweet stimuli. These deficits occurred in the cells located in the oral cavity as well as in the behavioral responses. However, it is not clear if these changes to the taste system are due to obesity or to the high fat diet exposure. The goal of the current study was to determine if diet or excess weight is responsible for the DIO induced taste deficits. Using a combination of live cell imaging, brief-access licking, immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR, we have found that diet and weight gain can each selectivity affect taste. Follow up experiments determined that two key signaling proteins, gustducin and phospholipase C{beta}2, are significantly reduced in the high fat diet without weight gain and obese mice, identifying a potential mechanism for the reduced taste responsiveness to some stimuli. Our data indicate that the relationship between obesity and taste is complex and reveal that for some stimuli, diet alone can cause taste deficits, even without the onset of obesity.",

    "abstract": "Traditional crop varieties are an important source of genetic diversity for crop adaptation and modern breeding. Landraces of Asian (Oryza sativa) and African (Oryza glaberrima) rice have been well studied on the continents where they were domesticated. However, their history of cultivation in northern South America is poorly understood. Here we reveal the rice diversity that is maintained by Maroons, descendants of enslaved Africans who fled to the interior forests of the Guianas ca. 300 years ago. We interviewed subsistence farmers who practice shifting cultivation along the Maroni and Lawa rivers that form the natural border between French Guiana and Suriname, and used ethnobotanical and morphological methods to identify around 50 varieties, of which 15 were previously undocumented. The genetic origin of these varieties was explored using the Angiosperms-353 universal probe set. Despite the large distances between sites and relative inaccessibility of the area, phenotypic and genetic diversity did not display any geographic structure, which is consistent with knowledge of seed exchange among members of the same ethnolinguistic group. Although improved US cultivars were introduced in Maroon villages in the 1940s, these have not displaced the traditional landraces, which are cherished for their taste and nutritious qualities and for their importance in Maroon spiritual life. The unique agricultural and ritual practices of Maroons confirm their role as custodians of rice diversity, a role that is currently under threat from external pressures and encroaching globalization. We expect that the rice diversity uncovered in this study represents only a fraction of the total diversity in the Guianas and may constitute a large untapped resource that holds promise for future rice improvement. Further efforts to inventory and preserve these landraces will help to protect a precious cultural heritage and local food security.",
