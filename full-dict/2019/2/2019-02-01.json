    "abstract": "Research on stomata, i.e., morphological structures of plants, has increased in popularity in the last years. These structures (pores) are in charge of the interaction between the internal plant system and the environment, working on different processes such as photosynthesis and transpiration stream. Besides, a better understanding of the pore mechanism plays a significant role when exploring the evolution process, as well as the behavior of plants. Although the study of stomata in dicots species of plants has advanced considerably in the past years, there is little information about stomata of cereal grasses. Also, automated detection of these structures have been considered in the literature, but some gaps are still uncovered. This fact is motivated by high morphological variation of stomata and the presence of noise from the image acquisition step. In this work, we propose a new methodology for automatic stomata classification and a new detection system in microscope images for maize cultivars. We have achieved an approximated accuracy of 97.1% in the identification of stomata regions using classifiers based on deep learning features, which figures out as a nearly perfect classification system.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRead coverage of RNA sequencing data reflects gene expression and RNA processing events. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods, particularly \"full-length\" ones, provide read coverage of many individual cells and have the potential to reveal cellular heterogeneity in RNA transcription and processing. However, visualization tools suited to highlighting cell-to-cell heterogeneity in read coverage are still lacking.\n\nResultsHere, we have developed Millefy, a tool for visualizing read coverage of scRNA-seq data in genomic contexts. Millefy is designed to show read coverage of all individual cells at once in genomic contexts and to highlight cell-to-cell heterogeneity in read coverage. By visualizing read coverage of all cells as a heat map and dynamically reordering cells based on diffusion maps, Millefy facilitates discovery of \"local\" region-specific, cell-to-cell heterogeneity in read coverage, including variability of transcribed regions.\n\nConclusionsMillefy simplifies the examination of cellular heterogeneity in RNA transcription and processing events using scRNA-seq data. Millefy is available as an R package (https://github.com/yuifu/millefy) and a Docker image to help use Millefy on the Jupyter notebook (https://hub.docker.com/r/yuifu/datascience-notebook-millefy).",

    "abstract": "Graph-based reference genomes have become popular as they allow read mapping and follow-up analyses in settings where the exact haplotypes underlying a high-throughput sequencing experiment are not precisely known. Two recent papers show that mapping to graph-based reference genomes can improve accuracy as compared to methods using linear references. Both of these methods index the sequences for most paths up to a certain length in the graph in order to enable direct mapping of reads containing common variants. However, the combinatorial explosion of possible paths through nearby variants also leads to a huge search space and an increased chance of false positive alignments to highly variable regions.\n\nWe here assess two prominent graph-based read mappers against a novel hybrid baseline approach that combines an initial path determination with a tuned linear read mapping method. We show, using a previously proposed benchmark, that this simple approach is able to improve accuracy of read-mapping to graph-based reference genomes.\n\nOur method is implemented in a tool, Two-step Graph Mapper, which is available at https://github.com/uio-bmi/two_step_graph_mapper along with data and scripts for reproducing the experiments.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria assemble the cell envelope using localized enzymes to account for growth and division of a topologically complicated surface1-3. However, a regulatory pathway has not been identified for assembly and maintenance of the surface layer (S-layer), a 2D crystalline protein coat surrounding the curved 3D surface of a variety of bacteria4,5. By specifically labeling, imaging, and tracking native and purified RsaA, the S-layer protein (SLP) from C. crescentus, we show that protein self-assembly alone is sufficient to assemble and maintain the S-layer in vivo. By monitoring the location of newly produced S-layer on the surface of living bacteria, we find that S-layer assembly occurs independently of the site of RsaA secretion and that localized production of new cell wall surface area alone is insufficient to explain S-layer assembly patterns. When the cell surface is devoid of a pre-existing S-layer, the location of S-layer assembly depends on the nucleation characteristics of SLP crystals, which grow by capturing RsaA molecules freely diffusing on the outer bacterial surface. Based on these observations, we propose a model of S-layer assembly whereby RsaA monomers are secreted randomly and diffuse on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) outer membrane until incorporated into growing 2D S-layer crystals. The complicated topology of the cell surface enables formation of defects, gaps, and grain boundaries within the S-layer lattice, thereby guiding the location of S-layer assembly without enzymatic assistance. This unsupervised mechanism poses unique challenges and advantages for designing treatments targeting cell surface structures or utilizing S-layers as self-assembling macromolecular nanomaterials. As an evolutionary driver, 2D protein self-assembly rationalizes the exceptional S-layer subunit sequence and species diversity6.",

    "abstract": "The Mediterranean basin is among the most impacted marine ecoregions globally, being at the same time semi-enclosed by densely populated countries and crossed by trafficked maritime routes. Such anthropogenic pressure threatens both the qual-ity of its waters and the high biodiversity living in them, making the role of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) crucial for pre-serving species suitable habitats. Under the European Union Marine Strategy Framework Directive, marine litter has been recognized as one of the principal causes of marine pollution, and public awareness on its environmental and biological impacts is raising. Using a quantitative and data-driven modelling approach, here we assess the presence of plastic waste within the feeding grounds of the fin whale Balaenoptera physalus, an endangered cetacean for which there is increasing evidence of impacts due to microplastic ingestion. To this end, we analyze a decade (2000 - 2010) of advection patterns of marine plastic litter, modelled with a Lagrangian approach. Particles are released in the MPA Pelagos, the International Sanctuary for the Protection of Mediterranean Marine Mammals (North-Western Mediterranean, between France, Italy and Monaco), from different sources (i.e., untreated waste along coasts, plastic discharged from rivers and plastic pollution released along maritime shipping routes). Risk of exposure of fin whales to microplastic pollution is evaluated by interlacing plastic litter distribution maps obtained through modelling with maps of suitable habitats obtained from the elaboration of satellite chlorophyll-a data in species-specific visited areas. Our modelling results show that all the three main sources of plastic litter taken into account clearly contribute to impacting cetaceans in the Sanctuary, yet in a different manner. The procedure formalized here can be extended to assess the risk caused by plastic pollution in other MPAs as well as to evaluate possible impacts on other taxa, thus informing targeted actions to tackle the complex issue of marine litter.",

    "abstract": "Despite decades of investigation into how antibiotics affect isolated bacteria, it remains highly challenging to predict consequences for communities in complex environments such as the human intestine. Interspecies interactions can impact antibiotic activity through alterations to the extracellular environment that change bacterial physiology. By measuring key metabolites and environmental pH, we determined that metabolic cross-feeding among members of the fruit fly gut microbiota drives changes in antibiotic sensitivity in vitro. Co-culturing of Lactobacillus plantarum with Acetobacter species induced tolerance to rifampin. Mechanistically, we found that acetobacters counter the acidification driven by L. plantarum production of lactate, and that pH shifts during stationary phase were sufficient to drive rifampin tolerance in L. plantarum monocultures. The key Lactobacillus physiological parameter related to tolerance was a reduction in lag time exiting stationary phase, opposite to a previously identified mode of tolerance to ampicillin in E. coli. Lactobacillus tolerance to erythromycin also depended on growth status and pH, suggesting that our findings generalize to other antibiotics. Finally, tolerance of L. plantarum to rifampin varied spatially across the fruit fly gut. This mechanistic understanding of the coupling among interspecies interactions, environmental pH, and antibiotic tolerance enables future predictions of growth and the effects of antibiotics in more complex communities and within hosts.",

    "abstract": "Cellulose over-producing wrinkly spreader mutants of Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 have been the focus of much investigation, but conditions promoting the production of cellulose in ancestral SBW25, its effects and consequences have escaped investigation through lack of in vitro phenotype. Here, using a custom built device, we reveal that in static broth microcosms ancestral SBW25 encounters environmental signals at the air-liquid interface that activate, via three diguanylate cyclase-encoding pathways (Wsp, Aws and Mws), production of cellulose. Secretion of the polymer at the meniscus leads to modification of the environment and growth of numerous micro-colonies that extend out from the surface. Accumulation of cellulose and associated microbial growth leads to Rayleigh-Taylor instability resulting in bioconvection and rapid transport of water-soluble products over tens of millimetres. Drawing upon data we build a mathematical model that recapitulates experimental results and captures the interactions between biological, chemical and physical processes.\n\nIMPORTANCEThis work reveals a new bacterial behaviour that manifests at the air-liquid interface, which depends on production of cellulose, and hints to hitherto unrecognised dimensions to bacterial life at surfaces. Additionally, the study links activation of known diguanylate cyclase-encoding pathways to cellulose expression and to signals encountered at the air-liquid interface. Further significance stems from recognition of the consequences of fluid instabilities arising from surface production of cellulose for transport of water-soluble products over large distances.",

    "abstract": "AbstractsO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSObesity has become a severe problem among the worlds population with clearly increasing prevalence over the last decades. Because obesity is associated with several comorbidities (e.g. hypertension or cancer) it constitutes an increasing burden for the health care system. Correlations between obesity and cognition have been studied in humans with ambivalent results. Here, we studied the effects of obesity on hippocampus dependent learning and memory and cell morphology in a mouse model of obesity.\n\nMethodsThe body mass of male and female Lep+/+(wt) and Lepob/ob(ob/ob) animals with access to food and water ad libitum was measured between postnatal day 60-200 and animals with clear adiposity (4-6 months) were further analyzed. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus was examined using phosphohistone H3 as a marker for proliferation, doublecortin as a marker for differentiation and caspase3 as a marker for apoptosis. Moreover, the density of dendritic spines on apical and basal dendrites of pyramidal neurons of the cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) were analyzed using Golgi impregnation. In addition, mice were subjected to the open field and Morris water maze test in order to analyze locomotor activity and spatial learning.\n\nResultsThe body weight of ob/ob mice nearly doubled during the first 120 postnatal days. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis was reduced in ob/ob mice due to reduced cell proliferation. Dendritic spine densities in the hippocampal area CA1 were not altered in ob/ob mice. Four to six months old ob/ob mice showed reduced locomotor activity in the open field test but similar performance in the Morris water maze compared to control mice.\n\nConclusionOur data show that alterations in adult neurogenesis in leptin-deficient mice are not associated with an impairment in spatial learning abilities. Moreover, ob/ob mice are inconspicuous in the Morris water maze and do not display altered spine densities in the hippocampus, suggesting that obesity does not have a severe impact upon hippocampal neuronal plasticity and spatial learning.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dynamics primarily refers to the opposing fission and fusion events between individual mitochondria, which maintains steady-state mitochondrial morphology in cells. The details of the bidirectional relationship between mitochondrial dynamics and energetics are unclear as the methods to integrate these mitochondrial aspects are lacking. To study the quantitative relationship between mitochondrial dynamics (fission, fusion, matrix continuity and diameter) and energetics (ATP and redox), we have developed and validated an analytical approach, mito-SinCe2. Application of this approach led to the hypothesis that mitochondria-dependent ovarian tumor initiating cells interconvert between 3 states with distinct relationships between mitochondrial energetics and dynamics. Interestingly, fusion and ATP increase linearly with each other only once a certain level of fusion is attained. Moreover, mitochondrial dynamics status changes linearly either with ATP or with redox, but not simultaneously with both. Furthermore, mito-SinCe2 analyses can potentially predict new quantitative features of the opposing fission vs. fusion relationship and classify cells into functional classes based on their mito-SinCe2 states.",

The initial innate immune response to injury and infectious stimuli through M1 polarisation is important for the outcome of disease. Appropriate macrophage polarisation requires complex coordination of local microenvironmental cues and cytokine signalling to influence immune cell phenotypes. If the molecular mechanisms behind macrophage polarisation were better understood then macrophages could be pharmacologically tuned to better deal with bacterial infections, for example tuberculosis. Here, using zebrafish tnfa:GFP transgenic lines as in vivo readouts of M1 macrophages, we show that hypoxia and stabilisation of Hif-1 polarises macrophages to a tnfa expressing phenotype. We demonstrate a novel mechanism of Hif-1 mediated macrophage tnfa upregulation via a cyclooxygenase/prostaglandin E2 axis, a mechanism that is conserved in human primary macrophages. These findings uncover a novel macrophage HIF/COX/TNF axis that links microenvironmental cues to macrophage phenotype that may have implications in inflammation, infection and cancer, where hypoxia is a common microenvironmental feature and where cyclooxygenase and Tnfa are major mechanistic players.",

Here, we show that four functionally distinct cell classes can be robustly identified from extracellular recordings in several cortical regions of awake behaving monkeys. We recorded extracellular spiking activity from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), the frontal eye field (FEF), and the lateral intraparietal area of macaque monkeys during a visuomotor decision-making task. We employed unsupervised clustering of spike waveforms, which robustly dissociated four distinct cell classes across all three brain regions. The four cell classes were functionally distinct. They showed different baseline firing statistics, visual response dynamics, and coding of visual information. While cell class-specific baseline statistics were consistent across brain regions, response dynamics and information coding were regionally specific. Our results identify four waveform-based cell classes in primate cortex. This opens a new window to dissect and study the cell-type specific function of cortical circuits.",

    "abstract": "In response to the increasingly problematic emergence of antibiotic resistance, novel strategies for combating pathogenic bacteria are being investigated. Targeting the agr quorum sensing system, which regulates expression of virulence in Staphylococcus aureus, is one potentially useful approach for combating drug-resistant pathogens that has not yet been fully explored. A previously published study of a fragment screen resulted in the identification of five compound fragments that interact with the DNA-binding domain of the response regulator AgrA from S. aureus. We have analyzed the ability of these compounds to affect agr-mediated virulence gene expression in S. aureus cells. Three of the compounds demonstrated the ability to reduce agr-driven transcription of at the P2 and P3 promoters of the agr operon and increase biofilm formation, and two of these compounds also showed the ability to reduce levels of secreted toxins. The finding that the compounds tested were able to reduce agr activity suggests that they could be useful tools for probing the effects of agr inhibition.\n\nFurthermore, the characteristics of compound fragments make them good starting materials for the development of compound libraries to iteratively improve the inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Asexual freshwater planarians are an attractive invertebrate model for high-throughput neurotoxicity screening, because they possess multiple quantifiable behaviors to assess distinct neuronal functions. Planarians uniquely allow direct comparisons between developing and adult animals to distinguish developmentally selective effects from general neurotoxicity. In this study, we used our automated planarian screening platform to compare the neurotoxicity of 15 flame retardants (FRs), consisting of representative phased-out brominated (BFRs) and replacement organophosphorus FRs (OPFRs). OPFRs have emerged as a proposed safer alternative to BFRs; however, limited information is available on their health effects. We found 11 of the 15 FRs (3/6 BFRs, 7/8 OPFRs, and Firemaster 550) caused adverse effects in both adult and developing planarians with similar nominal lowest-effect-levels for BFRs and OPFRs. This suggests that replacement OPFRs are comparably neurotoxic to the phased-out compounds. BFRs were primarily systemically toxic, whereas OPFRs, except Tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate, shared a behavioral phenotype in response to noxious heat at sublethal concentrations, indicating specific neurotoxic effects. By directly comparing effects on adult and developing planarians, we further found that one BFR (3,3,5,5-Tetrabromobisphenol A) caused a developmental selective defect. Together, these results demonstrate that our planarian screening platform yields high content data resulting from assaying various behavioral and morphological endpoints, allowing us to distinguish selective neurotoxic effects and effects specific to the developing nervous system. Ten of these 11 bioactive FRs were previously found to be bioactive in other models, including cell culture and alternative animal models (nematodes and zebrafish). This level of concordance across different platforms emphasizes the urgent need for further evaluation of OPFRs in mammalian systems.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of vitamin B12 in sea water is laborious, time consuming, and often requires storage of relatively large-volume water samples. Alleviating these major limitations will increase the throughput of samples and, as a consequence, improve our understanding of the distribution and role of vitamin B12 in the oceans. Previous studies have indicated that target analyte recovery is negatively affected at flow rates exceeding 1 mL min-1 using home-made C18 Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) cartridges. In this study, the effect of flow rate on recovery of vitamin B12 was tested across a range of flow rates between 1 and 37 mL min-1 using a commercial SPE cartridge containing surface-modified styrene divinylbenzene. Recovery of vitamin B12 at flow rates up to the maximum rate tested did not statistically differ from 1 mL min 1. A second study was conducted to determine whether storage of the SPE cartridges at -20{degrees}C had a negative impact on vitamin B12 recovery. Recovery of vitamin B12 from SPE cartridges stored up to 13 days did not differ from unfrozen SPE cartridges. These data suggest that rapid extraction and cold storage of vitamin B12 on commercial SPE cartridges does not negatively affect recovery and offers an economical alternative to field studies.",

    "abstract": "Primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) are a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders, frequently caused by loss-of-function and less commonly by gain-of-function mutations, which can result in susceptibility to a broad or a very narrow range of infections but also in inflammatory, allergic or malignant diseases. Owing to the wide range in clinical manifestations and variability in penetrance and expressivity, there is an urgent need to better understand the underlying molecular, cellular and immunological phenotypes in PID patients in order to improve clinical diagnosis and management. Here we have compiled a manually curated collection of public transcriptome datasets mainly obtained from human whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or fibroblasts of patients with PIDs and of control subjects for subsequent meta-analysis, query and interpretation. A total of nineteen (19) datasets derived from studies of PID patients were identified and retrieved from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and loaded in GXB, a custom web application designed for interactive query and visualization of integrated large-scale data. The dataset collection includes samples from well characterized PID patients that were stimulated ex vivo under a variety of conditions to assess the molecular consequences of the underlying, naturally occurring gene defects on a genome-wide scale. Multiple sample groupings and rank lists were generated to facilitate comparisons of the transcriptional responses between different PID patients and control subjects. The GXB tool enables browsing of a single transcript across studies, thereby providing new perspectives on the role of a given molecule across biological systems and PID patients.

    "abstract": "To understand the functioning and dynamics of microbial communities remains a fundamental challenge at the forefront of current biology. To tackle this challenge, the construction of computational models of interacting microbes is an indispensable tool. Currently, however, there is a large chasm between ecologically-motivated descriptions of microbial growth used in ecosystems simulations, and detailed metabolic pathway and genome-based descriptions developed within systems and synthetic biology. Here, we seek to demonstrate how current biochemical resource allocation models of microbial growth offer the potential to advance ecosystem simulations and their parameterization. In particular, recent work on quantitative microbial growth and cellular resource allocation allow us to formulate mechanistic models of microbial growth that are physiologically meaningful while remaining computationally tractable. Biochemical resource allocation models go beyond Michaelis-Menten and Monod-type growth models, and allow to account for emergent properties that underlie the remarkable plasticity of microbial growth. We exemplify our approach using a coarse-grained model of cyanobacterial phototrophic growth, and demonstrate how the model allows us to represent physiological acclimation to different environments, co-limitation of growth by several nutrients, as well as emergent switches between alternative nutrient sources. Our approach has implications for building models of microbial communities to understand their interactions, dynamics and response to environmental changes.",

    "abstract": "It is still a matter of debate whether the First Eukaryote Common Ancestor (FECA) arose from the merger of an archaeal host with an alphaproteobacterium, or was a proto-eukaryote with significant eukaryotic characteristics way before endosymbiosis occurred. The Last Eukaryote Common Ancestor (LECA) as its descendant is thought to be an entity that possessed functional and cellular complexity comparable to modern organisms. The precise nature and physiology of both of these organisms has been a long-standing, unanswered question in evolutionary and cell biology. Recently, a much broader diversity of eukaryotic genomes has become available and this means we can reconstruct early eukaryote evolution with a greater deal of precision. Here, we reconstruct a hypothetical genome for LECA from modern eukaryote genomes. The constituent genes were mapped onto 454 pathways from the KEGG database covering cellular, genetic, and metabolic processes across six model species to provide functional insights into its capabilities. We reconstruct a LECA that was a facultatively anaerobic, single-celled organism, similar to a modern Protist possessing complex predatory and sexual behaviour. We go on to examine how much of these capabilities arose along the FECA-to-LECA transition period. We see a at least 1,554 genes gained by FECA during this evolutionary period with extensive remodelling of pathways relating to lipid metabolism, cellular processes, genetic information processing, protein processing, and signalling. We extracted the BRITE classifications for the genes from the KEGG database, which arose during the transition from FECA-to-LECA and examine the types of genes that saw the most gains and what novel classifications were introduced. Two-thirds of our reconstructed LECA genome appears to be prokaryote in origin and the remaining third consists of genes with functional classifications that originate from prokaryote homologs in our LECA genome. Signal transduction and Post Translational Modification elements stand out as the primary novel classes of genes developed during this period. These results suggest that largely the eukaryote common ancestors achieved the defining characteristics of modern eukaryotes by primarily expanding on prokaryote biology and gene families.",

    "abstract": "Pleiotropic genes are genes that affect more than one trait. For example, many genes required for pigmentation in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster also affect traits such as circadian rhythms, vision, and mating behavior. Here, we present evidence that two pigmentation genes, ebony and tan, which encode enzymes catalyzing reciprocal reactions in the melanin biosynthesis pathway, also affect cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) composition in D. melanogaster females. More specifically, we report that ebony loss-of-function mutants have a CHC profile that is biased toward long (>25C) chain CHCs, whereas tan loss-of-function mutants have a CHC profile that is biased toward short (<25C) chain CHCs. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of dopamine synthesis, a key step in the melanin synthesis pathway, reversed the changes in CHC composition seen in ebony mutants, making the CHC profiles similar to those seen in tan mutants. These observations suggest that genetic variation affecting ebony and/or tan activity might cause correlated changes in pigmentation and CHC composition in natural populations. We tested this possibility using the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) and found that CHC composition covaried with pigmentation as well as levels of ebony and tan expression in newly eclosed adults in a manner consistent with the ebony and tan mutant phenotypes. These data suggest that the pleiotropic effects of ebony and tan might contribute to covariation of pigmentation and CHC profiles in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "A Transparent game is a game-theoretic setting that takes action visibility into account. In each round, depending on the relative timing of their actions, players have a certain probability to see their partners choice before making their own decision. This probability is determined by the level of transparency. At the two extremes, a game with zero transparency is equivalent to the classical simultaneous game, and a game with maximal transparency corresponds to a sequential game. Despite the prevalence of intermediate transparency in many everyday interactions such scenarios have not been sufficiently studied. Here we consider a transparent iterated Prisoners dilemma (iPD) and use evolutionary simulations to investigate how and why the success of various strategies changes with the level of transparency. We demonstrate that non-zero transparency greatly reduces the set of successful memory-one strategies compared to the simultaneous iPD. For low and moderate transparency the classical \"Win - Stay, Lose - Shift\" (WSLS) strategy is the only evolutionary successful strategy. For high transparency all strategies are evolutionary unstable in the sense that they can be easily counteracted, and, finally, for maximal transparency a novel \"Leader-Follower\" strategy outperforms WSLS. Our results provide a partial explanation for the fact that the strategies proposed for the simultaneous iPD are rarely observed in nature, where high levels of transparency are common.",

Sex is however inefficient due to the low viability or fertility of hybrid offspring and thus limits their evolutionary potential. Mitotic cell division could be an alternative to fertility recovery in facultative sexual species. To test this, we evolved under relaxed selection more than 600 diploid yeast hybrids between species that span 100,000 to 15 M years of divergence. We find that hybrids can recover fertility spontaneously and rapidly through whole-genome duplication. These events occurred in both hybrids between young and well-established species. Our results show that the instability of hybrid ploidy is a spontaneous path to fertility recovery.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryPloidy changes potentiate hybrid speciation by leading to fertility recovery.",
