    "abstract": "The Methyl-CpG-Binding Domain Protein family has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. The Methyl-CpG-binding domain 2 (Mbd2) binds methylated DNA and was shown to play an important role in cancer and immunity. Some evidence linked this protein to neurodevelopment. However, its exact role in neurodevelopment and brain function is mostly unknown.\n\nHere we show that Mbd2-deficiency in mice (Mbd2-/-) results in deficits in cognitive, social and emotional functions. Mbd2 binds regulatory DNA regions of neuronal genes in the hippocampus and loss of Mbd2 alters the expression of hundreds of genes with a robust down-regulation of neuronal gene pathways. Further, a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis found an altered DNA methylation pattern in regulatory DNA regions of neuronal genes in Mbd2-/- mice. Differentially expressed genes significantly overlap with gene-expression changes observed in brains of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) individuals. Notably, down-regulated genes are significantly enriched for human ortholog ASD risk-genes. Observed hippocampal morphological abnormalities were similar to those found in individuals with ASD and ASD rodent models. Hippocampal Mbd2 knockdown partially recapitulates the behavioral phenotypes observed in Mbd2-/- mice.\n\nThese findings suggest Mbd2 is a novel epigenetic regulator of genes that are associated with ASD in humans. Mbd2 loss causes behavioral alterations that resemble those found in ASD individuals.",

    "abstract": "Early identification of the risk for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) at the asymptomatic phase could lead to better prognosis. Here we developed a machine learning method to quantify systematic impact of all rare germline mutations on each pathway. We collected 106 TNBC patients and 287 elder healthy women controls. The spectra of activity profiles in multiple pathways were mapped and most pathway activities exhibited globally suppressed by the portfolio of individual germline mutations in TNBC patients. Accordingly, all individuals were delineated into two types: A and B. Type A patients could be differentiated from controls (AUC = 0.89) and sensitive to BRCA1/2 damages; Type B patients can be also differentiated from controls (AUC = 0.69) but probably being protected from BRCA1/2 damages. Further we found that Individuals with the lowest activity of selected pathways had extreme high relative risk (up to 21.67 in type A) and increased lymph node metastasis in these patients. Our study showed that genomic DNA contains information of unimaginable pathogenic factors. And this information is in a distributed form that could be applied to risk assessment for more cancer types.\n\nSignificanceWe identified individuals who are more susceptible to triple negative breast cancer. Our method performs much better than previous assessments based on BRCA1/2 damages, even polygenic risk scores. We disclosed previously unimaginable pathogens in a distributed form on genome and extended risk prediction to scenarios for other cancers.",

    "abstract": "The phenotype of one individual can be affected not only by the individuals own genotypes (direct genetic effects, DGE) but also by genotypes of interacting partners (indirect genetic effects, IGE). IGE have been detected using polygenic models in multiple species, including laboratory mice and humans. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Genome-wide association studies of IGE (igeGWAS) can point to IGE genes, but have not yet been applied to non-familial IGE arising from \"peers\" and affecting biomedical phenotypes. In addition, the extent to which igeGWAS will identify loci not identified by dgeGWAS remains an open question. Finally, findings from igeGWAS have not been confirmed by experimental manipulation.\n\nWe leveraged a dataset of 170 behavioural, physiological and morphological phenotypes measured in 1,812 genetically heterogeneous laboratory mice to study IGE arising between same-sex, adult, unrelated laboratory mice housed in the same cage. We developed methods for igeGWAS in this context and identified 24 significant IGE loci for 17 phenotypes (FDR < 10%). There was no overlap between IGE loci and DGE loci for the same phenotype, which was consistent with the moderate genetic correlations between DGE and IGE for the same phenotype estimated using polygenic models. Finally, we fine-mapped seven significant IGE loci to individual genes and confirmed, in an experiment with a knockout model, that Epha4 gives rise to IGE on stress-coping strategy and wound healing.\n\nOur results demonstrate the potential for igeGWAS to identify IGE genes and shed some light into the mechanisms of peer influence.",

    "abstract": "In gait stability research, neither self-selected walking speeds, nor the same prescribed walking speed for all participants, guarantee equivalent gait stability among participants. Furthermore, these options may differentially affect the response to different gait perturbations, which is problematic when comparing groups with different capacities. We present a method for decreasing inter-individual differences in gait stability by adjusting walking speed to equivalent margins of stability (MoS). Eighteen healthy adults walked on a split-belt treadmill for two-minute bouts at 0.4m/s up to 1.8m/s in 0.2m/s intervals. The stability-normalised walking speed (MoS=0.05m) was calculated using the mean MoS at touchdown of the final 10 steps of each speed. Participants then walked for three minutes at this speed and were subsequently exposed to a treadmill belt acceleration perturbation. A further 12 healthy adults were exposed to the same perturbation while walking at 1.3m/s: the average of the previous group. Large ranges in MoS were observed during the prescribed speeds (6-10cm across speeds) and walking speed significantly (P<0.001) affected MoS. The stability-normalised walking speeds resulted in MoS equal or very close to the desired 0.05m and reduced between-participant variability in MoS. The second group of participants walking at 1.3m/s had greater inter-individual variation in MoS during both unperturbed and perturbed walking compared to 12 sex, height and leg length-matched participants from the stability-normalised walking speed group. The current method decreases inter-individual differences in gait stability which may be beneficial for gait perturbation and stability research, in particular for studies on populations with different locomotor capacities.",

    "abstract": "Increasing awareness that parasitism is an essential component of nearly all aspects of ecosystem functioning, as well as a driver of biodiversity, has led to rising interest in the consequences of climate change in terms of parasitism and disease spread. Yet empirical knowledge on the extent and ways in which climatic factors affect parasite prevalence and intensities remains scarce. In an 18-year, multi-site, correlative study we investigated the contributions of weather variables and other factors to spatio-temporal variation in infestation by blowfly parasitic larvae (Protocalliphora spp.) in nests of Corsican blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus). We found that ambient temperature during the nestling stage is strongly and positively related to parasite load (number of parasites per chick), both across broods when controlling for year, and across years. In addition, annual mean parasite load also increased with minimal spring temperature, and decreased with increasing average temperature in the previous summer. There was no indication of a dependence of parasite dynamics on host dynamics in this system, likely due in part to the wide host range of blowflies that do not solely rely on blue tit hosts. This suggests a major effect of temperature during the blowfly life cycle, with potential implications for blowfly - host interactions across their geographical range as climate keeps warming up. Finally, given that ambient temperature increases throughout the breeding season and that blowflies negatively affect survival and recruitment of blue tits, these results also mean that parasites, along with caterpillar availability, can drive selection for breeding date in this system.",

    "abstract": "Self-renewal and lineage regulation of neural stem cells in the adult mammalian brain (aNSCs) are still far from been understood. Although previous studies have reported that some aNSCs in neurogenic niches showed irregular nuclei, their functional significance remains elusive. We used neural crest-derived human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) as an in vitro cell model of neurogenesis to investigate the functional significance of nuclear polymorphisms. Here, we show that hPDLSCs-derived neurons are not directly generated through cell division from stem cells. In fact, the cell shape of neural precursors is reset and start their neuronal development as round spheres. The hPDLSCs-derived neurons gradually adopted a complex morphology by forming several processes, that grew and arborized, adquiring dendritic-like and axonal-like identities, giving rise to a variety of neuron-like morphologies. To our knowledge, this article provides the first observation of these morphological events during in vitro neurogenesis and neuron polarization in human aNCSCs, and we have discovered a transient cell nuclei lobulation coincident to in vitro neurogenesis, without being related to cell proliferation. We observed that small DNA containing structures move within the cell to specific directions and temporarily form lobed nuclei. Morphological analysis also reveals that neurogenic niches in the adult mouse brain contains cells with nuclear shapes highly similar to those observed during in vitro neurogenesis from hPDLSCs. Our results provide strong evidence that neuronal differentiation from aNSCs may also occur during in vivo adult mammalian neurogenesis without being related to cell proliferation. In addition, we demonstrate that hPDLSCs-derived neurons display a sequence of morphologic development highly similar to those observed in primary neuronal cultures derived from rodent brains during neurogenesis, providing strong evidence that it is possible to reproduce neurogenic processes and obtain neurons from hPDLSCs. Beyond the central nervous system, the presence of lobed nuclei has been reported in most blood and immune cells, but the functional significance of multilobed nuclear structures is not yet stablished. Our results suggest that multilobed nuclear structures is associated to nuclear movement within the cell.",

For example, the volatile anesthetic isoflurane was reported in several studies to induce hypoxia-inducible factors, and thereby enhance malignant phenotypes in vitro. Indeed, these transcription factors are considered critical regulators of cancer-related hallmarks, including \"sustained proliferative signaling, evasion of growth suppressors, resistance to cell death, replicative immortality, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis.\" This study aimed to investigate the impact of isoflurane on the growth and migration of derivatives of the renal cell line RCC4. We indicated that isoflurane treatment did not positively influence cancer cell phenotypes, and that hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) maintain hallmark cancer cell phenotypes including gene expressions signature, metabolism, cell proliferation and cell motility. The present results indicate that HIF activity is not influenced by the volatile anesthetic isoflurane.",

Here, we carried out a comprehensive characterization of conserved kinetochore components in the moss Physcomitrella patens and uncovered a distinct scenario in plant cells regarding both the localization and cellular impact of the kinetochore proteins. Most surprisingly, knock-down of several kinetochore proteins led to polyploidy, not aneuploidy, through cytokinesis failure in >90% of the cells that exhibited lagging chromosomes for several minutes or longer. The resultant cells, containing two or more nuclei, proceeded to the next cell cycle and eventually developed into polyploid plants. As lagging chromosomes have been observed in various plant species in the wild, our observation raised a possibility that they could be one of the natural pathways to polyploidy in plants.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of gene expression is an important mechanism through which genetic variation can affect complex traits. A substantial portion of gene expression variation can be explained by both local (cis) and distal (trans) genetic variation. Much progress has been made in uncovering cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL), but trans-eQTL have been more difficult to identify and replicate. Here we take advantage of our ability to predict the cis component of gene expression coupled with gene mapping methods such as PrediXcan to identify high confidence candidate trans-acting genes and their targets. That is, we correlate the cis component of gene expression with observed expression of genes in different chromosomes. Leveraging the shared cis-acting regulation across tissues, we combine the evidence of association across all available GTEx tissues and find 2356 trans-acting/target gene pairs with high mappability scores. Reassuringly, trans-acting genes are enriched in transcription and nucleic acid binding pathways and target genes are enriched in known transcription factor binding sites. Interestingly, trans-acting genes are more significantly associated with selected complex traits and diseases than target or background genes, consistent with percolating trans effects. Our scripts and summary statistics are publicly available for future studies of trans-acting gene regulation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCattle populations are highly amenable to the genetic mapping of male reproductive traits because longitudinal data on ejaculate quality and dense microarray-derived genotypes are available for many artificial insemination bulls. Two young Nordic Red bulls delivered sperm with low progressive motility (i.e., asthenospermia) during a semen collection period of more than four months. The bulls were related through a common ancestor on both their paternal and maternal ancestry. Thus, a recessive mode of inheritance of asthenospermia was suspected.\n\nResultsBoth bulls were genotyped at 54,001 SNPs using the Illumina BovineSNP50 Bead chip. A scan for autozygosity revealed that they were identical by descent for a 2.98 Mb segment located on bovine chromosome 25. This haplotype was not found in the homozygous state in 8,557 fertile bulls although five homozygous haplotype carriers were expected (P=0.018). Whole genome-sequencing uncovered that both asthenospermic bulls were homozygous for a mutation that disrupts a canonical 5 splice donor site of CCDC189 encoding the coiled-coil domain containing protein 189. Transcription analysis showed that the derived allele activates a cryptic splice site resulting in a frameshift and premature termination of translation. The mutated CCDC189 protein is truncated by more than 40%, thus lacking the flagellar C1a complex subunit C1a-32 that is supposed to modulate the physiological movement of the sperm flagella. The mutant allele occurs at a frequency of 2.5% in Nordic Red cattle.\n\nConclusionsOur study in cattle uncovered that CCDC189 is required for physiological movement of sperm flagella thus enabling active progression of spermatozoa and fertilization. A direct gene test may be implemented to monitor the asthenospermia-associated allele and prevent the birth of homozygous bulls that are infertile.

High-resolution structural information can only be reached if crystals are perfectly flat and highly ordered. In practice, such crystals are difficult to obtain. Available image unbending algorithms correct for disorder, but only perform well on images of non-tilted, flat crystals, while out-of-plane distortions are not addressed. Here, we present an approach that employs single-particle refinement procedures to locally unbend crystals in 3D. With this method, density maps of the MloK1 potassium channel with a resolution of 4 [A] were obtained from images of 2D crystals that do not diffract beyond 10 [A]. Furthermore, 3D classification allowed multiple structures to be resolved, revealing a series of MloK1 conformations within a single 2D crystal. This conformational heterogeneity explains the poor diffraction observed and is related to channel function. The approach is implemented in the FOCUS package.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary graph theory models the effects of natural selection and random drift on structured populations of mutant and non-mutant individuals. Recent studies have shown that fixation times, which determine the rate of evolution, often have right-skewed distributions. Little is known, however, about how these distributions and their skew depend on mutant fitness. Here we calculate the fitness dependence of the fixation-time distribution for the Moran Birth-death process in populations modeled by two extreme networks: the complete graph and the one-dimensional ring lattice, each of which admits an exact solution in the limit of large network size. We find that with non-neutral fitness, the Moran process on the ring has normally distributed fixation times, independent of the relative fitness of mutants and non-mutants. In contrast, on the complete graph, the fixation-time distribution is a weighted convolution of two Gumbel distributions, with a weight depending on the relative fitness. When fitness is neutral, however, the Moran process has a highly skewed fixation-time distribution on both the complete graph and the ring. In this sense, the case of neutral fitness is singular. Even on these simple network structures, the fixation-time distribution exhibits rich fitness dependence, with discontinuities and regions of universality. Applications of our methods to a multi-fitness Moran model, times to partial fixation, and evolution on random networks are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The most aggressive and invasive tumor cells often reside in hypoxic microenvironments and rely heavily on rapid anaerobic glycolysis for energy production. This switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, along with up-regulation of the glucose transport system, significantly increases the release of lactic acid from cells into the tumor microenvironment. Excess lactate and proton excretion exacerbate extracellular acidification to which cancer cells, but not normal cells, adapt. We have hypothesized that carbonic anhydrases (CAs) play a role in stabilizing both intracellular and extracellular pH to favor cancer progression and metastasis. Here we show that proton efflux (acidification) using the glycolytic rate assay is dependent on both extracellular pH (pHe) and CA IX expression. Yet, isoform selective sulfonamide-based inhibitors of CA IX did not alter proton flux, which suggests that the catalytic activity of CA IX is not necessary for this regulation. Other investigators have suggested the CA IX cooperates with the MCT transport family to excrete protons. To test this possibility, we examined the expression patterns of selected ion transporters and show that members of this family are differentially expressed within the molecular subtypes of breast cancer. The most aggressive form of breast cancer, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), appears to coordinately express the monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) and carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX). This supports a possible mechanism that utilizes the intramolecular H+ shuttle system in CA IX to facilitate proton efflux through MCT4.",

Influential neurocognitive models of ADHD link behavioral symptoms to altered connections between and within functional brain networks. Here, we investigate whether network-based theories of ADHD can be generalized to understanding variations in ADHD-related behaviors within the normal (i.e., clinically unaffected) adult population. In a large and representative sample, self-rated presence of ADHD symptoms varied widely; only eight out of 291 participants scored in the clinical range. Subject-specific brain-network graphs were modeled from functional MRI resting-state data and revealed significant associations between (non-clinical) ADHD symptoms and region-specific profiles of between-module and within-module connectivity. Effects were located in brain regions associated with multiple neuronal systems including the default-mode network, the salience network, and the central executive system. Our results are consistent with network perspectives of ADHD and provide further evidence for the relevance of an appropriate information transfer between task-negative (default-mode) and task-positive brain regions. More generally, our findings support a dimensional conceptualization of ADHD and contribute to a growing understanding of cognition as an emerging property of functional brain networks.\n\nAuthor SummaryNeurocognitive models of ADHD link behavioral symptoms to altered connections between and within functional brain networks.

    "abstract": "The traditional focus on taxonomic diversity metrics for investigating species responses to habitat loss and fragmentation has limited our understanding on how biodiversity is impacted by habitat modification. This is particularly true for taxonomic groups such as bats which exhibit species-specific responses. Here, we investigate phylogenetic alpha and beta diversity of Neotropical bat assemblages across two environmental gradients, one in habitat quality and one in habitat amount. We surveyed bats in 39 sites located across a whole-ecosystem fragmentation experiment in the Brazilian Amazon, representing a gradient of habitat quality (interior-edge-matrix, hereafter IEM) in both continuous forest and forest fragments of different sizes (1, 10, and 100 ha; forest size gradient). For each habitat category, we quantified alpha and beta phylogenetic diversity, then used linear models and cluster analysis to explore how forest area and IEM gradient affect phylogenetic diversity. We found that the secondary forest matrix harboured significantly lower total evolutionary history compared to the fragment interiors, especially the 1 ha fragments, containing bat assemblages with more closely related species. Forest fragments [&ge;] 10 ha had levels of phylogenetic richness similar to continuous forest, suggesting that large fragments retain considerable levels of evolutionary history. The edge and matrix adjacent to large fragments tend to have closely related lineages nonetheless, suggesting phylogenetic homogenization in these IEM gradient categories. Thus, despite the high mobility of bats, fragmentation still induces considerable levels of erosion of phylogenetic diversity, suggesting that the various evolutionary history might not be able to persist in present-day human-modified landscapes.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThird-generation sequencing technologies Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore allow the sequencing of long reads of tens of kbp, that are expected to solve various problems, such as contig and haplotype assembly, scaffolding, and structural variant calling. However, they also display high error rates that can reach 10 to 30%, for basic ONT and non-CCS PacBio reads. As a result, error correction is often the first step of projects dealing with long reads. As first long reads sequencing experiments produced reads displaying error rates higher than 15% on average, most methods relied on the complementary use of short reads data to perform correction, in a hybrid approach. However, these sequencing technologies evolve fast, and the error rate of the long reads now reaches 10 to 12%. As a result, self-correction is now frequently used as the first step of third-generation sequencing data analysis projects. As of today, efficient tools allowing to perform self-correction of the long reads are available, and recent observations suggest that avoiding the use of second-generation sequencing reads could bypass their inherent bias.\n\nResultsWe introduce CONSENT, a new method for the self-correction of long reads that combines different strategies from the state-of-the-art. More precisely, we combine a multiple sequence alignment strategy with the use of local de Bruijn graphs. Moreover, the multiple sequence alignment benefits from an efficient segmentation strategy based on k-mer chaining, which allows a considerable speed improvement. Our experiments show that CONSENT compares well to the latest state-of-the-art self-correction methods, and even outperforms them on real Oxford Nanopore datasets. In particular, they show that CONSENT is the only method able to efficiently scale to the correction of Oxford Nanopore ultra-long reads, and is able to process a full human dataset, containing reads reaching lengths up to 1.5 Mbp, in 15 days. Additionally, CONSENT also implements an assembly polishing feature, and is thus able to correct errors directly from raw long read assemblies. Our experiments show that CONSENT outperforms state-of-the-art polishing tools in terms of resource consumption, and provides comparable results. Moreover, we also show that, for a full human dataset, assembling the raw data and polishing the assembly afterwards is less time consuming than assembling the corrected reads, while providing better quality results.\n\nAvailability and implementationCONSENT is implemented in C++, supported on Linux platforms and freely available at https://github.com/morispi/CONSENT.\n\nContactpierre.morisse2@univ-rouen.fr",

    "abstract": "Scene-selective regions of the human brain form allocentric representations of locations in our environment. These representations are independent of heading direction and allow us to know where we are regardless of our direction of travel. However, we know little about how these location-based representations are formed. Using fMRI representational similarity analysis and linear mixed-models, we tracked the emergence of location-based representations in scene-selective brain regions. We estimated patterns of activity for two distinct scenes, taken before and after participants learnt they were from the same location. During a learning phase, we presented participants with two types of panoramic videos: (1) an overlap video condition displaying two distinct scenes (0{degrees} and 180{degrees}) from the same location, and (2) a no-overlap video displaying two distinct scenes from different locations (that served as a control condition). In the parahippocampal cortex (PHC) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC), representations of scenes from the same location became more similar to each other only after they had been shown in the overlap condition, suggesting the emergence of viewpoint-independent location-based representations. Whereas these representations emerged in the PHC regardless of task performance, RSC representations only emerged for locations where participants could behaviourally identify the two scenes as belonging to the same location. The results suggest that we can track the emergence of location-based representations in the PHC and RSC in a single fMRI experiment. Further, they support computational models that propose the RSC plays a key role in transforming viewpoint-independent representations into behaviourally-relevant representations of specific viewpoints.",

We have sequenced the genome of the Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis), the largest extant monitor lizard, and present a high resolution de novo chromosome-assigned genome assembly for V. komodoensis, generated with a hybrid approach of long-range sequencing and single molecule physical mapping. Comparing the genome of V. komodoensis with those of related species showed evidence of positive selection in pathways related to muscle energy metabolism, cardiovascular homeostasis, and thrombosis. We also found species-specific expansions of a chemoreceptor gene family related to pheromone and kairomone sensing in V. komodoensis and several other lizard lineages. Together, these evolutionary signatures of adaptation reveal genetic underpinnings of the unique Komodo sensory, cardiovascular, and muscular systems, and suggest that selective pressure altered thrombosis genes to help Komodo dragons evade the anticoagulant effects of their own saliva. As the only sequenced monitor lizard genome, the Komodo dragon genome is an important resource for understanding the biology of this lineage and of reptiles worldwide.",

    "abstract": "RNA plays essential regulatory roles in all known forms of life. Clustering RNA sequences with common sequence and structure is an essential step towards studying RNA function. With the advent of high-throughput sequencing techniques, experimental and genomic data are expanding to complement the predictive methods. However, the existing methods do not effectively utilize and cope with the immense amount of data becoming available.\n\nHere we present GraphClust2, a comprehensive approach for scalable clustering of RNAs based on sequence and structural similarities. GraphClust2 provides an integrative solution by incorporating diverse types of experimental and genomic data in an accessible fashion via the Galaxy framework. We demonstrate that the tasks of clustering and annotation of structured RNAs can be considerably improved, through a scalable methodology that also supports structure probing data. Based on this, we further introduce an off-the-shelf procedure to identify locally conserved structure candidates in long RNAs. In this way, we suggest the presence and the sparsity of phylogenetically conserved local structures in some long non-coding RNAs. Furthermore, we demonstrate the advantage of a scalable clustering for discovering structured motifs under inherent and experimental biases and uncover prominent targets of the double-stranded RNA binding protein Roquin-1 that are evolutionary conserved.",

    "abstract": "Classifying the mechanisms of antibiotic failure has led to the development of new treatment strategies for killing bacteria. Among the currently described mechanisms, which include resistance, persistence and tolerance, we propose bacterial defiance as a form of antibiotic failure specific to prodrugs. As a prototypic model of a bacteria-activated prodrug, we construct cationic antimicrobial peptides (AMP), which are charge neutralized until activated by a bacterial protease. This construct successfully eliminated the vast majority of bacteria populations, while localizing activity to bacterial membranes and maintaining low active drug concentration. However, we observed defiant bacteria populations, which survive in the presence of identical drug concentration and exposure time. Using a multi-rate kinetic feedback model, we show that bacteria switch between susceptibility and defiance under clinically relevant environmental (e.g., hyperthermia) and genetic (e.g., downregulated protease expression) conditions. From this model, we derive a dimensionless quantity (Bacterial Advantage Heuristic, BAH) - representing the balance between bacterial proliferation and prodrug activation - that perfectly classifies bacteria as defiant or susceptible across a broad range of conditions. To apply this concept to other classes of prodrugs, we expand this model to include both linear and nonlinear terms and use general pharmacokinetic parameters (e.g., half-life, EC50, etc.). Taken together, this model reveals an analogous dimensionless quantity (General Advantage Key, GAK), which can applied to prodrugs with different activation mechanisms. We envision that these studies will enable the development of more effective prodrugs to combat antibiotic resistance.",

    "abstract": "The composition and function of the gut microbiota are strongly associated with human health, and dysbiosis is linked to an array of diseases, ranging from obesity and diabetes to infection and inflammation. Engineering synthetic circuits into gut bacteria to sense, record and respond to in vivo signals is a promising new approach for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease. Here, we repurpose a synthetic bacterial memory circuit to rapidly screen for and discover new in vivo-responsive biosensors in commensal gut Escherichia coli. We develop a pipeline for rapid systems-level library construction and screening, using next-generation sequencing and computational analysis, which demonstrates remarkably robust identification of responsive biosensors from pooled libraries. By testing both genome-wide and curated libraries of potential biosensor triggers--each consisting of a promoter and ribosome binding site (RBS)--and using RBS variation to augment the range of trigger sensitivity, we identify and validate triggers that selectively activate our synthetic memory circuit during transit through the gut. We further identify biosensors with increased response in the inflamed gut through comparative screening of our libraries in healthy mice and those with intestinal inflammation. Our results demonstrate the power of systems-level screening for the identification of novel biosensors in the gut and provide a platform for disease-specific screening using synthetic circuits, capable of contributing to both the understanding and clinical management of intestinal illness.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe gut is a largely obscure and inaccessible environment. The use of live, engineered probiotics to detect and respond to disease signals in vivo represents a new frontier in the management of gut diseases. Engineered probiotics have also shown promise as a novel mechanism for drug delivery. However, the design and construction of effective strains that respond to the in vivo environment is hindered by our limited understanding of bacterial behavior in the gut. Our work expands the pool of potential biosensors for the healthy and diseased gut, providing insight into host-microbe interactions and enabling future development of increasingly complex synthetic circuits. This method also provides a framework for rapid prototyping of engineered systems and for application across bacterial strains and disease models.",

Cancer Stem-like Cells (CSCs), a rare cell population within the tumour, accumulate after anti-estrogen treatments and are likely to contribute to their failure. Here we studied the role of p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) as a promising target to overcome endocrine resistance and disease progression in ER+ breast cancers. PAK4 predicts for resistance to tamoxifen and poor prognosis in 2 independent cohorts of ER+ tumours. We observed that PAK4 strongly correlates with CSC activity in metastatic patient-derived samples irrespective of breast cancer subtype. However, PAK4-driven mammosphere-forming CSC activity increases alongside progression only in ER+ metastatic samples. PAK4 activity increases in ER+ models during acquired resistance to endocrine therapies. Targeting PAK4 with either CRT PAKi, a small molecule inhibitor of PAK4, or with specific siRNAs abrogates CSC activity/self-renewal in clinical samples and endocrine-resistant cells.

Decades of research of Cys-loop receptors have identified motifs in both the extracellular and transmembrane domains that mediate pentameric assembly. Those efforts have largely ignored the most diverse domain of these channels, the intracellular domain (ICD). Here we identify molecular determinants inside the ICD for pentameric assembly by first identifying the segments contributing to pentamerization using deletion constructs, and remarkably by making a small number of defined amino acid substitutions. Our work provides direct experimental evidence for the contribution of three arginines, previously implicated in governing the low conductance of 5-HT3ARs, in structural features such as pentameric assembly.",

    "abstract": "Regenerated cartilage formed after Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation may be of suboptimal quality due to postulated hypertrophic changes. Parathyroid hormone-related peptide, containing the parathyroid hormone sequence (PTHrP 1-34), enhances cartilage growth during development and inhibits hypertrophic differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and growth plate chondrocytes. This study aims to determine whether human articular chondrocytes respond correspondingly. Healthy human articular cartilage-derived chondrocytes (n=6 donors) were cultured on type II collagen-coated transwells with/without 0.1 or 1.0 M PTH from day 0, 9, or 21 until the end of culture (day 28). Extracellular matrix production, (pre)hypertrophy and PTH signaling were assessed by RT-qPCR and/or immunohistochemistry for collagen type I, II, X, RUNX2, MMP13, PTHR1 and IHH and by determining glycosaminoglycan production and DNA content. The Bern score assessed cartilage quality by histology. Regardless of the concentration and initiation of supplementation, PTH treatment significantly decreased DNA and glycosaminoglycan content and reduced the Bern score compared with controls. Type I collagen deposition was increased, whereas PTHR1 expression and type II collagen deposition were decreased by PTH supplementation. Expression of the (pre)hypertrophic markers MMP13, RUNX2, IHH and type X collagen were not affected by PTH. In conclusion, PTH supplementation to healthy human articular chondrocytes did not affect hypertrophic differentiation, but negatively influenced cartilage quality, the tissues extracellular matrix and cell content. Although PTH may be an effective inhibitor of hypertrophic differentiation in MSC-based cartilage repair, care may be warranted in applying accessory PTH treatment due to its effects on articular chondrocytes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHypertension is a leading cause of cardio-vascular diseases and its attributed mortality. No previous study, however, assessed the prevalence and associated factors of hypertension in the study area.\n\nMethodsWe recruited a representative sample of 627 adult individuals from selected kebeles of Hosanna town. A multi-stage sampling technique was employed in the study. A structured questionnaire using the WHO STEPS approach was employed to conduct a face to face interview and physical measurements. For each participant, we measured blood pressure two times after giving 10 minutes breaks between the measurements and we took the average. Hypertension status was defined as \"systolic blood pressure [&ge;]140mmhg and/or diastolic blood pressure [&ge;]90mmhg\". Undiagnosed hypertension was defined as participants who had raised blood pressure on measurement, but not aware of it before. We used Multivariable logistic regression model to determine factors associated with hypertension.\n\nResultsThe overall prevalence of hypertension was found to be 17.2% (95% CI 14.5 - 19.9), 19.3% among men and 14.2% among women, of which 10.2% were unaware of it before. Hypertension was significantly associated with old age [&ge;]35 years, excess alcohol intake, consumption of saturated oil/fat), consumption of unspecified different types of oil/fat and overweight/obesity.\n\nConclusionThe prevalence of hypertension (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) in the town is unacceptably high. This is also related to modifiable risk factors like excessive alcohol intake, overweight/obesity and consumption of saturated fat/oil. Therefore, designing health information provision systems on the risk factors of hypertension and promotion of good health practices should be considered. Moreover, the health departments should facilitate blood pressure screening programs at community levels to identify and treat undiagnosed hypertension.",

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a monogenic autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) Cl- channel. CF results in multiorgan dysfunction and ultimately mortality from respiratory sequelae. Although pharmacologic approaches have demonstrated efficacy in reducing symptoms and respiratory decline, a curative treatment modality remains elusive. Gene therapy, a promising curative strategy, has been limited due to poor correction efficiencies both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we use Cas9 and adeno-associated virus 6 (AAV6) to correct the {Delta}F508 mutation (found in [~]70% of CF alleles and [~]90% of CF patients in North America) in upper airway basal stem cells (UABCs) obtained from CF and non-CF patients undergoing functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). In UABCs from homozygous ({Delta}F508/{Delta}F508) and compound heterozygous ({Delta}F508/Other) CF patients, we achieved 28 {+/-} 5 % and 42 {+/-} 15% correction, respectively. In homozygous human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs), we achieved 41{+/-} 4 % correction. Upon differentiation in air-liquid interface (ALI), cultures of corrected CF cells displayed partial restoration of CFTRinh-172 sensitive Cl- currents relative to non-CF controls: 31{+/-} 5 % in UABCs and 51 {+/-} 3 % in HBECs (both from subjects homozygous for {Delta}F508 CFTR). Finally, gene edited cells embedded successfully and retained expression of cytokeratin 5 (KRT5), a basal cell marker, on a FDA-approved porcine small intestinal submucosal (pSIS) membrane previously shown to improve re-mucosalization after FESS. In summary, we present an efficient, feeder-free, selection-free and clinically compatible approach to generate cell-based therapies for CF from autologous airway stem cells. This approach represents a first step towards developing patient-specific autologous airway stem cell transplant as a curative treatment for CF.",

    "abstract": "Renal fibrosis is accompanied with the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Despite a number of past and ongoing studies, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains elusive. Here we explored the progression of renal fibrosis by using a mouse model, unilateral ureter obstruction (UUO). We found that in the initial stage of the progression where extracellular matrix did not deposit yet, the proximal tubular cells arrested at the G2 of the cell cycle. This G2 arrest was induced prior to activation of both DNA damage checkpoint and Wnt/{beta}-Catenin pathway. Further analyses in vivo and in vitro indicated the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is involved in the G2 arrest after the damage. The newly produced monoclonal antibody against p21 revealed that the p21 levels were sharply upregulated in response to the damage during the initial stage, but dropped down toward the later stage. To examine the function of p21 in the progression of renal fibrosis, we constructed the novel p21 deficient mice by i-GONAD. Compared with wild-type mice, p21 deficient mice showed the exacerbation of the fibrosis. Thus we propose that during the initial stage of the fibrosis following the renal damage, tubular cells arrest in the G2 phase depending on p21, thereby safeguarding the kidney functions.",

    "abstract": "The organisation of mammalian genomes into loops and topologically associating domains (TADs) contributes to chromatin structure, gene expression and recombination. Loops and TADs are formed by cohesin and positioned by CTCF. In proliferating cells, cohesin also mediates sister chromatid cohesion, which is essential for chromosome segregation. Current models of chromatin folding and cohesion are based on assumptions of how many cohesin and CTCF molecules organise the genome. Here we have measured absolute copy numbers and dynamics of cohesin, CTCF, NIPBL, WAPL and sororin by mass spectrometry, fluorescence-correlation spectroscopy and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching in HeLa cells. In G1-phase there are ~245,000 cohesin complexes, of which ~139,000 are on chromatin. Comparison with chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing data implies that some genomic cohesin and CTCF enrichment sites are unoccupied in single cells at any one time. We discuss the implications of these findings for how cohesin can contribute to genome organisation and cohesion.",

This is thanks in part to the microbial diversity that they contain in their gut compartments. However, millipedes and their gut microbiota are understudied, compared to other arthropods. For this reason, we partook in a metagenomic analysis of the gut of Anadenobolus monilicornis. We collected specimens of A. monilicornis, which were starved for a varying amount of time, from different municipalities of Puerto Rico. Once the DNA from their guts was extracted and sequenced using the MinION nanopore sequencer, we proceeded to analyze and compile the data obtained from the sequencer using programs such as Phylosift and MEGAN6 and the web-based MG-RAST. From our two best samples, we obtained a total of 87,110 and 99,749 reads, respectively. After comparing the data analyses and gene annotation done for both samples, we found that the bacterial phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were consistently well represented; one of our samples had much more Chlamydiae representation than the other, however. Sampled eukaryote phyla include Arthropoda, Chordata and Streptophyta. We would need a greater sample size to better determine differences in microbial diversity between millipede populations across the island; considering our small sample size, however, we were able to broadly reveal the diversity within the microenvironment of A. monilicorniss gut.",

    "abstract": "Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is commonly prescribed after transplantation and has proven advantages over other immunosuppressive drugs but gastrointestinal (GI) side effects frequently limit its use. The pathways involved in the metabolism of the prodrug MMF and the bioactive derivative mycophenolic acid (MPA) are well characterized but the mechanism responsible for toxicity is unknown. Here we extend our previous observation that an intact gut microbiome is required for MMF-induced toxicity and demonstrate that gut bacterial metabolism is responsible for the GI inflammation and weight loss associated with MMF exposure. In mice consuming MMF, the introduction of vancomycin alone was sufficient to prevent or reverse MMF-induced weight loss and colonic inflammation. MMF induced the expansion of bacteria expressing {beta}-glucuronidase (GUS) in the cecum and proximal colon. GUS activity, which is responsible for the catabolism of glucuronidated MPA (MPAG) to free MPA, was increased in the presence of MMF and eliminated by vancomycin. Vancomycin eliminated multiple Bacteroides spp. that flourished in the presence of MMF and prevented the breakdown of MPAG without negatively affecting serum MPA levels. Human data suggests that increased stool GUS activity can be associated with MMF-related toxicity. Our work provides a mechanism for the GI toxicity associated with MMF and a future direction for the development of therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTau cleavage by different proteolytic enzymes generates short, aggregation-prone fragments that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD). Asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) activity in particular has been associated with tau dysfunction and aggregation, and the activity of the protease is increased in both aging and AD.\n\nMethods and ResultsUsing a mass spectrometry approach we identified a novel tau cleavage site at N167 and confirmed its processing by AEP. In combination with the previously known site at N368, we show that AEP cleavage yields a tau fragment that is present in both control and AD brains at similar levels. AEP is a lysosomal enzyme, and our data suggest that it is expressed in microglia rather than in neurons. Accordingly, we observe tau cleavage at N167 and N368 after endocytotic uptake into microglia, but not neurons. However, tau168-368 does not accumulate in microglia and we thus conclude that the fragment is part of a proteolytic cascade leading to tau degradation.\n\nConclusionsWhile we confirm previous studies showing increased overall AEP activity in AD brains, our data suggests that AEP-mediated cleavage of tau is a physiological event occurring during microglial degradation of the secreted neuronal protein. The disease-associated increase in active AEP may thus be related to pro-inflammatory conditions in AD brains, and our findings argue against AEP inhibition as a therapeutic approach in AD.",

    "abstract": "Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are an essential cell source in tissue engineering, studies of development, and disease modeling. Efficient, broadly amenable protocols for rapid lineage induction of hPSCs are of great interest in the stem cell biology field. We describe a simple, robust method for differentiation of hPSCs into mesendoderm in defined conditions utilizing single-cell seeding (SCS) and BMP4 and Activin A (BA) treatment. Gene sets and gene ontology terms related to mesoderm and endoderm differentiation were enriched after 48 hours of BA treatment. BA treatment was readily incorporated into existing protocols for chondrogenic and endothelial progenitor cell differentiation. After prolonged differentiation in vitro or in vivo, BA pre-treatment resulted in higher mesoderm and endoderm levels at the expense of ectoderm formation. These data demonstrate that SCS with BA treatment is a powerful method for induction of mesendoderm that can be integrated into protocols for mesoderm and endoderm differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Rab11 and its effectors dRip11 and MyoV are essential for polarized post-Golgi vesicle trafficking to photosensitive membrane rhabdomeres in Drosophila photoreceptors. Here, we found that Parcas (Pcs), recently shown to have guanine-nucleotide-exchange (GEF) activity toward Rab11, co-localizes with Rab11 on the trans-side of Golgi units and post-Golgi vesicles at the base of the rhabdomeres in pupal photoreceptors. Pcs fused with the EM-tag APEX2 localizes on 150-300 nm vesicles at the trans-side of Golgi units, which are presumably fly recycling endosomes (RE). Loss of Pcs impairs Rab11 localization on the trans-side of Golgi units and induces the cytoplasmic accumulation of post-Golgi vesicles bearing rhabdomere proteins, as observed in Rab11-deficiency. In contrast, loss of the specific subunits of TRAPPII, another known Rab11-GEF, does not cause any defects on the eye development nor the transport of rhabdomere proteins, however, simultaneous loss of TRAPPII and Pcs shows severe defects on eye development. These results indicated that in pupal photoreceptors, Pcs is the predominant Rab11-GEF, and TRAPPII performs a function that is redundant but subsidiary to that of Pcs.\n\nSummary statementParcas, a Rab11-GEF, recruits Rab11 onto Golgi-associated RE and post-Golgi vesicles in fly photoreceptors. Loss of Parcas results in rhodopsin accumulation within the cytoplasm, similar to that observed under Rab11-deficiency.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with an increased risk of brain atrophy, aging-related diseases, and mortality. We examined potential advanced brain aging in MDD patients, and whether this process is associated with clinical characteristics in a large multi-center international dataset.\n\nMethodsWe performed a mega-analysis by pooling brain measures derived from T1-weighted MRI scans from 29 samples worldwide. Normative brain aging was estimated by predicting chronological age (10-75 years) from 7 subcortical volumes, 34 cortical thickness and 34 surface area, lateral ventricles and total intracranial volume measures separately in 1,147 male and 1,386 female controls from the ENIGMA MDD working group. The learned model parameters were applied to 1,089 male controls and 1,167 depressed males, and 1,326 female controls and 2,044 depressed females to obtain independent unbiased brain-based age predictions. The difference between predicted \"brain age\" and chronological age was calculated to indicate brain predicted age difference (brain-PAD).\n\nFindingsOn average, MDD patients showed a higher brain-PAD of +0.90 (SE 0.21) years (Cohens d=0.12, 95% CI 0.06-0.17) compared to controls. Relative to controls, first-episode and currently depressed patients showed higher brain-PAD (+1.2 [0.3] years), and the largest effect was observed in those with late-onset depression (+1.7 [0.7] years). In addition, higher brain-PAD was associated with higher self-reported depressive symptomatology (b=0.05, p=0.004).\n\nInterpretationThis highly powered collaborative effort showed subtle patterns of abnormal structural brain aging in MDD. Substantial within-group variance and overlap between groups were observed. Longitudinal studies of MDD and somatic health outcomes are needed to further assess the predictive value of these brain-PAD estimates.\n\nFundingThis work was supported, in part, by NIH grants U54 EB020403 and R01 MH116147.",

In this study, we conducted genome- and epigenome-wide association studies on the levels of 92 neurological proteins to identify genetic and epigenetic loci associated with their plasma concentrations (n = 750). We identified 62 independent genome-wide significant loci for 37 proteins (P < 5.4 x 10-10) and 68 epigenome-wide significant sites associated with the levels of 7 proteins (P < 3.9 x 10-10). Using this information, we identified biological pathways in which putative neurological biomarkers are implicated as well as molecular mechanisms through which genetic variation may perturb plasma protein levels. Additionally, we found evidence that poliovirus receptor is causally associated with Alzheimers disease. In conclusion, we identified many novel genetic and epigenetic factors that are associated with neurological protein levels which may inform disease biology and establish causal relationships between biomarkers and neurological diseases.",

    "abstract": "The presence of somatic driver mutations in endometriosis has previously been believed to represent early events in transformation, however our group and others have described such mutations in roughly one-third of cases of deep infiltrating or iatrogenic endometriosis. These forms of endometriosis rarely progress to malignancy. Recent studies have also shown somatic driver mutations in normal skin, blood, peritoneal washings, and esophageal epithelium. Such findings prompt speculation on whether such mutations exist in the eutopic endometrium - the likely tissue of origin of endometriosis. In the current study we investigated the presence of somatic driver mutations in histologically normal endometrium from women lacking evidence of gynecologic malignancy or endometrial hyperplasia. Twenty-five women who underwent hysterectomies and 85 women who underwent endometrial biopsies were included in this study. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens were analyzed by means of targeted sequencing followed by orthogonal validation with droplet digital PCR. PTEN and ARID1A immunohistochemistry (IHC) was also performed as surrogates for inactivating mutations in the respective genes. Overall, we observed somatic driver-like events in over 50% of histologically normal endometrial samples analyzed, which included hotspot mutations in KRAS, PIK3CA, and FGFR2 as well as PTEN-loss by IHC. Analysis of anterior and posterior samplings collected from women who underwent hysterectomies is consistent with the presence of somatic driver mutations within clonal pockets spread throughout the uterus. The prevalence of such oncogenic mutations also increased with age (OR: 1.05 (95% CI: 1.00 - 1.10), p = 0.035). These findings have implications on our understanding of aging and so-called \"normal tissues\", thereby necessitating caution in the utilization of mutation-based early detection tools for endometrial or other cancers.",

    "abstract": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the most severe form of acute lung injury, responsible for high mortality and long-term morbidity. As a dynamic syndrome with multiple etiologies its timely diagnosis is difficult as is tracking the course of the syndrome. Therefore, there is a significant need for early, rapid detection and diagnosis as well as clinical trajectory monitoring of ARDS. Here we report our work on using human breath to differentiate ARDS and non-ARDS causes of respiratory failure. A fully automated portable 2-dimensional gas chromatography device with high peak capacity, high sensitivity, and rapid analysis capability was designed and made in-house for on-site analysis of patients breath. A total of 85 breath samples from 48 ARDS patients and controls were collected. Ninety-seven elution peaks were separated and detected in 13 minutes. An algorithm based on machine learning, principal component analysis (PCA), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was developed. As compared to the adjudications done by physicians based on the Berlin criteria, our device and algorithm achieved an overall accuracy of 87.1% with 94.1% positive predictive value and 82.4% negative predictive value. The high overall accuracy and high positive predicative value suggest that the breath analysis method can accurately diagnose ARDS. The ability to continuously and non-invasively monitor exhaled breath for early diagnosis, disease trajectory tracking, and outcome prediction monitoring of ARDS may have a significant impact on changing practice and improving patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Defining a  healthy gut microbiome has been a challenge in the absence of detailed information on both host health and microbiome composition. Here, we analyzed a multi-omics dataset from hundreds of individuals (discovery n=399, validation n=540) enrolled in a consumer scientific wellness program to identify robust associations between host physiology and gut microbiome structure. We attempted to predict gut microbiome -diversity from nearly 1000 analytes measured from blood, including clinical laboratory tests, proteomics and metabolomics. While a broad panel of 77 standard clinical laboratory tests and a set of 263 proteins from blood could not accurately predict gut microbial -diversity, we found that 45% of the variance in microbial community diversity was explained by a subset of 40 blood metabolites, many of microbial origin. This relationship between the host metabolome and gut microbiome -diversity was very robust, persisting across disease conditions and antibiotics use. Several of these novel metabolic biomarkers of gut microbial diversity were previously associated with host health (e.g. cardiovascular disease risk, diabetes, and kidney function). A subset of 11 metabolites classified participants with potentially problematic low -diversity (ROC AUC=0.88, Precision-Recall AUC=0.76). Relationships between host metabolites and -diversity remained consistent across most of the Body Mass Index (BMI) spectrum, but were modified in extreme obesity (class II/III, but not class I), suggesting a significant metabolic shift. Out-of-sample prediction accuracy of -diversity from the 40 identified blood metabolites in a validation cohort, whose microbiome samples were analyzed by a different vendor, confirmed the robust correspondence between gut microbiome structure and host physiology. Collectively, our results reveal a strong coupling between the human blood metabolome and gut microbial diversity, with implications for human health.",

    "abstract": "Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Despite aggressive therapy, about one-third of patients with MB still die, and survivors suffer severe long-term side effects due to the treatments. The poor post-treatment outcomes are tightly linked to unpredictable drug resistance. Therefore, before developing robust single drug or drug combination recommendation algorithms, uncovering the underlying protein-protein interaction (PPI) network patterns that accurately explain and predict drug resistances for MB subtypes is essential and important. In this study, we hypothesize that the loop sub-structure within the PPI network can explain and predict drug resistance. Both static and dynamic models are built to evaluate this hypothesis for three MB subtypes. Specifically, a static model is created to first validate that many reported therapeutic targets are located topologically on highly deregulated loop sub-structure and then to characterize the loop for tumors without treatment. Next, with the after-treatment time-series genomics data, a dynamic hidden Markov model (HMM) with newly designed initialization scheme estimates the successful and unsuccessful occurrence probabilities for each given PPI and then re-delineates the loop for post-treatment tumors. Finally, the comparison of loop structures pre- and post-treatment distinguishes effective and ineffective treatment options, demonstrating that the loop sub-structure is capable of interpreting the mechanism of drug resistance. In summary, effective treatments show much stronger inhibition of cell cycle and DNA replication proteins when compared to ineffective treatments after considering the cross talk of multiple pathways (the loop).",

Strains producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) or carbapenemases are considered global priority pathogens for which new treatment and prevention strategies are urgently required, due to severely limited therapeutic options. South and Southeast Asia are major hubs for antimicrobial resistant (AMR) K. pneumoniae, and also for the characteristically antimicrobial sensitive, community-acquired  hypervirulent strains. The emergence of hypervirulent AMR strains and lack of data on exopolysaccharide diversity pose a challenge for K. pneumoniae BSI control strategies worldwide.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a retrospective genomic epidemiology study of 365 BSI K. pneumoniae from seven major healthcare facilities across South and Southeast Asia, extracting clinically relevant information (AMR, virulence, K and O antigen loci) using Kleborate.\n\nFindingsK. pneumoniae BSI isolates were highly diverse, comprising 120 multi-locus sequence types (STs) and 63 K-loci. ESBL and carbapenemase gene frequencies were 47% and 17%, respectively. The aerobactin synthesis locus (iuc), associated with hypervirulence, was detected in 28% of isolates. Importantly, 7% of isolates harboured iuc plus ESBL and/or carbapenemase genes. The latter represent genotypic AMR-virulence convergence, which is generally considered a rare phenomenon but was particularly common amongst South Asian BSI (17%). Of greatest concern, we identified seven novel plasmids carrying both iuc and AMR genes, raising the prospect of co-transfer of these phenotypes amongst K. pneumoniae.\n\nInterpretationSouth and Southeast Asia are high-risk regions for the emergence of AMR and convergent AMR-hypervirulent K. pneumoniae.

    "abstract": "As more work assert passive restoration as a complementary approach to technical reclamation, it is imperative to know its drivers. Although the consequences of endozoochory are crucial to predict passive restoration success, few experimental studies assess the use of heavily disturbed sites by seed dispersers such as carnivores and how the seeds they bring in emerge and survive. Using an indoor sowing experiment conducted in situ, we examined for the first time how carnivore endozoochorous seeds collected in a quarry potentially influence its passive restoration, through effects on plant emergence and survival. Also, we tested whether sowing date and water soaking, relevant factors when sowings are to be carried out, would affect seedling emergence and survival rates when compared with the effect of endozoochory. Most interesting in our analysis were the results for Carob tree (Ceratonia siliqua), a dry-fruited species being used in an ongoing action of artificial revegetation of this quarry located within a natural park in Portugal. Irrespective of the carnivore species, endozoochorous carob seeds collected in the quarry performed similarly to untreated seeds regarding emergence rates. Endozoochorous carob seedlings showed greater mortality rates but the net result for the plant can still be the colonization of recently vacant habitats by a large proportion of viable seeds. The later carob seeds were sown, the faster seedlings emerged, including endozoochorous seedlings. As expected, water soaking implied faster emergences. Broadly, plantings, sowings with previous soaking, and carnivore-mediated seed dispersal of this dry-fruited tree can jointly enhance quarry restoration.\n\nImplications for practiceO_LIRestorers can undertake pilot sowing experiments similar to ours prior to large scale revegetation campaigns to identify which species can benefit the most from endozoochory.\nC_LIO_LICarnivores in the surroundings of a quarry contribute a large proportion of viable seeds, likely assisting quarry passive restoration.\nC_LIO_LICarnivores ingesting carob seeds later in the fruiting season may assist quarry passive revegetation more readily as seeds ingested around that time emerge earlier.\nC_LIO_LIImmersion in tap water seems to be a simple, inexpensive, and a highly efficient method to break physical dormancy when carob seed sowings are to be carried out in degraded sites.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Sensory neurons are chemically and functionally heterogeneous and this heterogeneity has been examined extensively over the last several decades. These studies have employed a variety of different methodologies, including anatomical, electrophysiological and molecular approaches. Recent studies using next generation sequencing techniques have examined the transcriptome of single sensory neurons. Although, these reports have provided a wealth of exciting new information on the heterogeneity of sensory neurons, correlation with functional types is lacking. Here, we employed retrograde tracing of cutaneous and muscle afferents to examine the variety of mRNA expression profiles of individual, target-specific sensory neurons. In addition, we used an ex vivo skin/nerve/DRG/ spinal cord preparation to record and characterize the functional response properties of individual cutaneous sensory neurons that were then intracellularly labeled with fluorescent dyes, recovered from dissociated cultures and analyzed for gene expression. We found that by using single cell qPCR techniques and a limited set of genes, we can identify transcriptionally distinct groups. We have also used calcium imaging and single cell qPCR to determine the correlation between levels of mRNA expression and functional protein expression and how functional properties correlated with the different transcriptional groups. These studies show that although transcriptomics does map to functional types, within any one functional subgroup, there are highly variable patterns of gene expression. Thus, studies that rely on the expression pattern of one or a few genes as a stand in for physiological experiments, runs a high risk of data misinterpretation with respect to function.\n\nSignificance statementExpression profiles of unidentified sensory neurons have been recently studied using RNASeq techniques. Here, we utilize a multifactorial approach to target identified cutaneous and muscle afferents to examine expression and functional levels of specific high priority candidate genes using ex vivo electrophysiology, Ca2+ imaging, and single cell qPCR. Using this methodology, we were able to identify specific groups of neurons with distinct functional properties that corresponded to unique transcriptional profiles. This represents the first attempt to relate neuronal phenotype with levels of gene expression in single identified afferents and highlights the importance of combining functional analysis with transcriptomics.",

    "abstract": "Long term surveillance of vectors and arboviruses is an integral aspect of disease prevention and control systems in countries affected by increasing risk. Yet, little effort has been made to adjust space-time risk estimation by integrating disease case counts with vector surveillance data, which may result in inaccurate risk projection when several vector species are present, and little is known about their likely role in local transmission. Here, we integrate 13 years of dengue case surveillance and associated Aedes occurrence data across 462 localities in 63 districts to estimate the risk of infection in the Republic of Panama. Our space-time modelling approach detected the presence of five clusters, which varied by duration, relative risk, and spatial extent after incorporating vector species as covariates. Dengue prevalence (n = 49,910) was predicted by the presence of resident Aedes aegypti alone, while all other covariates exhibited insignificant statistical relationships with it, including the presence and absence of invasive Aedes albopictus. Furthermore, the Ae. aegypti model contained the highest number of districts with more dengue cases than would be expected given baseline population levels. This implies that arbovirus case surveillance coupled with entomological surveillance can affect cluster detection and risk estimation, improving efforts to understand outbreak dynamics at national scales.\n\nAuthor SummaryDengue cases have increased in tropical regions worldwide owing to climate change, urbanization, and globalization facilitating the spread of Aedes mosquito vectors. National surveillance programs monitor trends in dengue fever and inform the public about epidemiological scenarios where outbreak preventive actions are most needed. Yet, most estimations of dengue risk so far derive only from disease case data, ignoring Aedes occurrence as a key aspect of dengue transmission dynamic. Here we illustrate how incorporating vector presence and absence as a model covariate can considerably alter the characteristics of space-time cluster estimations of dengue cases. We further show that Ae. aegypti has likely been a greater driver of dengue infection in high risk districts of Panama than Ae. albopictus, and provide a discussion of possible public health implications of both spatial and non-spatial model outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Few studies have addressed the predictive power of the clinical parameters used in assessing caries lesion activity. This study assessed the predictive validity of evaluating clinical parameters that are related to caries lesion activity status, individually and combined, in a long-term analysis. The occlusal surfaces of primary molars (1361 surfaces) were examined in 205 children according to the following clinical features: potential for plaque stagnation, colour, luster, cavitation, texture, and clinical depth. Cavities with frankly exposed dentine were excluded from this sample. After 1 year, 148 children (828 surfaces) were re-evaluated using the International Caries Detection and Assessment System to assess caries lesion progression. Progression was set as an outcome to verify the predictive power of the initially assessed clinical parameters. Different combinations of two or more parameters were also tested to check for any association with caries progression. Multilevel Poisson regression analyses were performed and the relative risk for each parameter/combination tested was calculated by considering a confidence interval of 95%. Forty percent of the reassessed surfaces presented caries progression after 1 year. Despite their surface integrity, dentine caries lesions were approximately 10-fold more likely and enamel lesions were approximately three-fold more likely to progress than sound surfaces. Similarly, cavitated lesions showed the highest risk of progression compared to sound/non-cavitated lesions. When only non-cavitated surfaces were considered, roughness proved to be a risk factor for caries progression. In conclusion, the lesions presenting clinical involvement of the dentine and even those cavitations clinically involving only the enamel had a higher risk of progression compared to sound or non-cavitated surfaces. For these lesions, the evaluation of other conjoint parameters seems unnecessary. Nevertheless, surface roughness can be a useful feature in predicting the risk of non-cavitated caries lesion progression.",

    "abstract": "Spina bifida aperta (SBA), one of the most common congenital malformations, causes various neurological disorders. Pain is a common complaint of patients with SBA. However, little is known about the neuropathology of SBA-related pain. Because loss of {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons in the spinal cord dorsal horn is associated with pain, we hypothesized the existence of cross-talk between SBA-related pain and alterations in GABAergic transmission in the spinal cord. Therefore, we investigated the kinetics of GABAergic transmission in the spinal cord dorsal horn in a chicken model of SBA. Neonatal chicks with SBA exhibited various pain-like behaviors, such as an increased number of vocalizations with elevated intensity (loudness) and frequency (pitch), reduced mobility, difficulty with locomotion, and escape reactions. Furthermore, the chicks with SBA did not respond to standard toe-pinching, indicating disruption of the spinal cord sensorimotor networks. These behavioral observations were concomitant with loss of GABAergic transmission in the spinal cord dorsal horn. We also found apoptosis of GABAergic neurons in the superficial dorsal horn in the early neonatal period, although cellular abnormalization and propagation of neurodegenerative signals were evident at middle to advanced gestational stages. In conclusion, ablation of GABAergic neurons induced alterations in spinal cord neuronal networks, providing novel insights into the pathophysiology of SBA-related pain-like complications.",

Island faunas often contain disproportionate numbers of endemic species, and hence we might expect cryptic, endemic species to be discovered relatively frequently in bats inhabiting islands. Species are best defined when multiple lines of evidence supports their diagnosis. Here we use morphometric, acoustic, and molecular phylogenetic data to show that a horseshoe bat in the Andaman Islands is distinct in all three aspects, supporting its description as a newly described endemic species. We recommend investigation into possible new and endemic bat species on islands by using integrated approaches that provide independent lines of evidence for taxonomic distinctiveness.

One of the main reasons for this high mortality rate is the evolution of new Mtb strains that are resistant to available antibiotics. Therefore, new therapeutics for TB are in constant demand. Here we report the development of such inhibitors that target two DNA replication enzymes of Mtb, namely DnaG primase and DNA gyrase, which share a conserved TOPRIM fold near the inhibitors binding site. The molecules were developed on the basis of previously reported inhibitors for T7 DNA primase that bind near the TOPRIM fold. In order to improve the physicochemical properties of the molecules as well as their inhibitory effect on primase and gyrase, 49 novel compounds were synthesized as potential drug candidates in three stages of optimization. The last stage of chemical optimization yielded two novel inhibitors for the fast-growing nonpathogenic model Mycobacterium smegmatis (Msmg).",

Oomycetes secrete diverse effector proteins into plant cells. The mechanisms through which these effectors promote virulence are largely unknown. We show that the HaRxL10 effector protein from the Arabidopsis thaliana pathogen Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa) targets a transcriptional repressor (JAZ3) involved in jasmonic acid (JA) signalling. This manipulation activates a regulatory cascade that inhibits salicylic acid (SA) signalling, which normally restricts Hpa infection. This virulence mechanism is functionally equivalent to but mechanistically distinct from activation of the antagonistic JA-SA hormone crosstalk by the bacterial JA-mimicking toxin coronatine and by bacterial Type III effectors. These results reveal a key role for JAZ3 in plant immunity and emphasize that JA-SA crosstalk is an Achilles heel in the plant immune system, vulnerable to manipulation by diverse microbes.",

The Athena SWAN award scheme for gender equality has become a widespread means to address barriers for womens advancement and leadership in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, the United States of America, and Canada, while he European Commission is exploring the introduction of a similar award scheme across Europe.\n\nMethodsThis study analyses the design and implementation of 16 departmental Athena SWAN Silver action plans in Medical Sciences at one of the worlds leading universities in Oxford, United Kingdom. Data pertaining to the design and implementation of gender equality interventions were extracted from the action plans, analysed thematically, coded using categories from the 2015 Athena SWAN Charter Awards Handbook, and synthesised against a typology of gender equality interventions in the European Research Area. The results were further analysed against the complexity research literature framework, where research organisations are perceived as dynamic systems that adapt, interact and co-evolve with other systems.\n\nResultsAthena SWAN is a complex contextually-embedded system of action planning within the context of universities. It depends on a multitude of contextual variables that relate in complex, non-linear ways, and dynamically adapt to constantly moving targets and new emergent conditions. Athena SWAN Silver action plans conform to the key considerations of complexity: 1) multiple actions and areas of intervention with a focus on the complex system embedded in and the local dynamics, 2) the non-linearity of interventions and the constantly emerging conditions, 3) impact in terms of contribution to change, improved conditions to foster change, and the increased probability that change can occur.\n\nConclusionsTo enact effective sustainable gender equality structural and cultural change, it is necessary to acknowledge and operationalize complexity as a frame of reference. Athena SWAN is the single most comprehensive and systemic gender equality scheme in Europe and can be strengthened further by promoting the integration of sex and gender analysis in research and education. Gender equality policies in the wider European Research Area can benefit from exploring Athena SWANs contextually-embedded systemic approach to dynamic action planning and inclusive focus on all genders and categories of staff and students.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAn important task of macromolecular structure determination by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is the identification of single particles in micrographs (particle picking). Currently, particle picking is laborious, time consuming, and potentially biased due to the need of human intervention to initialize the particle picking. The results typically include many false positives and negatives. Adjusting the parameters to eliminate false positives often excludes true particles in certain orientations. The supervised machine learning (e.g. deep learning) methods for particle picking often need a large training dataset, which requires extensive manual annotation. Other reference-dependent methods rely on low-resolution templates for particle detection, matching and picking, and therefore, are not fully automated. These issues motivate us to develop a fully automated, unbiased framework for particle picking.\n\nResultsWe design a fully automated, unsupervised approach for single particle picking in cryo-EM micrographs. Our approach consists of three stages: image preprocessing, particle clustering, and particle picking. The image preprocessing is based on image averaging, normalization, cryo-EM image contrast enhancement correction (CEC), histogram equalization, restoration, adaptive histogram equalization, guided image filtering, and morphological operations significantly improves the quality of original cryo-EM images. Our particle clustering method is based on an intensity distribution model which is much faster and more accurate than traditional K-means and Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithms for single particle clustering. Our particle picking method, based on image cleaning and shape detection with a modified Circular Hough Transform algorithm, effectively detects the shape and the center of each particle and creates a bounding box encapsulating the particles.\n\nConclusionsAutoCryoPicker can automatically and effectively recognizes particle-like objects from in noisy cryo-EM micrographs without the need of labeled training data and human intervention and therefore is a useful tool for cryo-EM protein structure determination.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCalling genetic variations from sequence reads is an important problem in genomics. There are many existing methods for calling various types of variations. Recently, Google developed a method for calling single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) based on deep learning. Their method visualizes sequence reads in the forms of images. These images are then used to train a deep neural network model, which is used to call SNPs. This raises a research question: can deep learning be used to call more complex genetic variations such as structural variations (SVs) from sequence data?\n\nResultsIn this paper, we extend this high-level approach to the problem of calling structural variations. We present DeepSV, an approach based on deep learning for calling long deletions from sequence reads. DeepSV is based on a novel method of visualizing sequence reads. The visualization is designed to capture multiple sources of information in the sequence data that are relevant to long deletions. DeepSV also implements techniques for working with noisy training data. DeepSV trains a model from the visualized sequence reads and calls deletions based on this model. We demonstrate that DeepSV outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency of deletion calling on the data from the 1000 Genomes Project.\n\nConclutionsOur work shows that deep learning can potentially lead to effective calling of different types of genetic variations that are complex than SNPs.\n\nAvailability and implementationDeepSVs source code and sample result as part of this project are readily available from GitHub at https://github.com/CSuperlei/DeepSV/.",

Actomyosin rings also function as the driving force during cell wound repair. We previously showed that Tumbleweed and Pebble are required for the cell wound repair process. Here, we show that Pavarotti also functions during wound repair and confirm that while Pavarotti, Tumbleweed, and Pebble are utilized during this cellular repair, it is not as the conserved centralspindlin complex. Surprisingly, in vitro and in vivo work show that the classically microtubule-associated Pavarotti binds directly to actin and has a non-canonical role directly regulating actin dynamics. We show that Pavarotti also works independently from Tumbleweed in several actin-related processes during the normal developmental process of oogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) is a class B G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in metabolism. Presently, its visualization is limited to genetic manipulation, antibody detection or the use of probes that stimulate receptor activation. Herein, we present LUXendin645, a far-red fluorescent GLP1R antagonistic peptide label. LUXendin645 produces intense and specific membrane labeling throughout live and fixed tissue. GLP1R signaling can additionally be evoked when the receptor is allosterically modulated in the presence of LUXendin645. Using LUXendin645 and STED-compatible LUXendin651 we describe islet GLP1R expression patterns, reveal higher-order GLP1R organization including the existence of membrane nanodomains, and track single receptor subpopulations. We furthermore show that different fluorophores can confer agonistic behavior on the LUXendin backbone, with implications for the design of stabilized incretin-mimetics. Thus, our labeling probes possess divergent activation modes, allow visualization of endogenous GLP1R, and provide new insight into class B GPCR distribution and dynamics.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that cells exhibit a variety of morphologically distinct responses to their environments that manifest in their cell shape. Some protrude uniformly to increase substrate contacts, others are broadly contrac-tile, some polarize to facilitate migration, and yet others exhibit mixtures of these responses. Prior imaging studies have identified a discrete collection of shapes that the majority of cells display and have demonstrated links between those shapes and activity levels of the cytoskeletal regulators Rho GTPases. Here we use a novel computational modeling approach to demonstrate that well known Rho GTPase signaling dynamics naturally give rise to this diverse but discrete (rather than continuum) set of morphologies. Specifically, the combination of auto-activation and mutually-antagonistic crosstalk between GTPases along with the conservative membrane (un)binding dynamics readily explain at least 6 of the 7 commonly observed morphologies. We further use this methodology to map the entire parameter space of this model and show that in appropriate regimes, individual parameter sets give rise to a variety of different morphologies. This provides an explanation for how seemingly similar cells of the same fate derived from the same population can exhibit a diverse array of cell shapes in imaging studies. These results thus demonstrate that Rho GTPases form the core of a cytoskeletal regulatory system governing cell shape, further supporting the picture that they act as a central signaling hub determining how cells respond to their environmental context.",

    "abstract": "Consistent daylight oscillations and abundant oxygen availability are fundamental to human health. While both are connected from an evolutionary and cellular perspective, only oxygen is an established therapy in cardiovascular medicine. Here, we probe the mechanistic intersection between light-(Period 2, PER2) and oxygen-(hypoxia inducible factor, HIF1A) sensing pathways in cellular adaptation to low oxygen conditions with respect to myocardial ischemia.\n\nUsing a whole genome array from daylight exposed wildtype or Per2-/- mice, an affinity purification-mass spectrometry-based proteomics screen for PER2 targets in hypoxic human endothelial cells, and targeted metabolomics from human healthy volunteers after daylight therapy, we investigated the intersection of light and hypoxia elicited pathways. Housing mice under daylight conditions prior to myocardial ischemia and reperfusion (IR)-injury, uncovered circadian PER2 amplitude enhancement as novel cardioprotective strategy, mimicking HIF1A metabolic adaptation to myocardial ischemia in a PER2 regulated manner. Whole genome array analysis from daylight exposed wildtype and Per2-/- mice or myocardial IR-injury in endothelial specific PER2 deficient mice (Per2loxP/loxP-VE-Cadherin -Cre) revealed a critical role for light elicited PER2 in maintaining the endothelial barrier function during myocardial ischemia. Mechanistic studies in human endothelia pointed towards a master transcriptional regulatory role for endothelial PER2 in metabolic reprograming to hypoxia via HIF1A, which was mimicked during normoxic PER2 stabilization. Translational investigation of light elicited pathways in human healthy volunteers found similar increases of PER2 or mimicking of HIF1A dependent metabolism. These studies identify light elicited circadian amplitude enhancement of endothelial PER2 as a novel cardioprotective strategy. Furthermore, these studies identify PER2 as critical control point of endothelial metabolic reprograming to maintain vascular integrity during myocardial IR-injury and implicate the use of daylight therapy to increase endothelial PER2 signaling as a strategy for the treatment of coronary artery disease.",

Using structural and functional MRI data from 114 stroke patients, 24 matched controls, and the Human Connectome Project, we tested the hypothesis that structural disconnection, not damage to critical regions, underlies FC disruptions. Disconnection severity outperformed damage to putative FC connector nodes for explaining reductions in system modularity, and multivariate models based on disconnection outperformed damage models for explaining FC disruptions within and between systems. Across patients, disconnection and FC patterns exhibited a low-dimensional covariance dominated by a single axis linking interhemispheric disconnections to reductions in FC measures of interhemispheric system integration, ipsilesional system segregation, and system modularity, and that correlated with multiple behavioral deficits. These findings clarify the structural basis of FC disruptions in stroke patients and demonstrate a low-dimensional link between perturbations of the structural connectome, disruptions of the functional connectome, and behavioral deficits.",

    "abstract": "Precise signaling at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is essential for proper muscle contraction. In the C. elegans pharynx, acetylcholine (ACh) released from the MC and M4 motor neurons stimulates two different types of contractions in adjacent muscle cells, termed pumping and isthmus peristalsis. MC stimulates rapid pumping through the nicotinic ACh receptor EAT-2, which is tightly localized at the MC NMJ, and eat-2 mutants exhibit a slow pump rate. Surprisingly, we found that eat-2 mutants also hyperstimulated peristaltic contractions, and these are characterized by increased and prolonged Ca2+ transients in the isthmus muscles. This hyperstimulation depends on crosstalk with the GAR-3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor as gar-3 mutation specifically suppressed the prolonged contraction and increased Ca2+ observed in eat-2 mutant peristalses. Similar GAR-3 dependent hyperstimulation was also observed in mutants lacking the ace-3 acetylcholinesterase, and we suggest that NMJ defects in eat-2 and ace-3 mutants result in ACh stimulation of extrasynaptic GAR-3 receptors in isthmus muscles. gar-3 mutation also suppressed slow larval growth and prolonged lifespan phenotypes that result from dietary restriction in eat-2 mutants, indicating that crosstalk with the GAR-3 receptor has a long-term impact on feeding behavior and eat-2 mutant phenotypes.\n\nArticle SummaryAcetylcholine stimulates different contractions in adjacent muscle cells in the C. elegans pharynx called pumping and peristalsis. The signaling mechanisms stimulating pumping have been characterized, but how these mechanisms affect peristalsis is unknown. Here we examined muscle contractions and Ca2+ transients during peristalsis in wild-type animals and acetylcholine signaling mutants. Surprisingly we found that while mutants affecting the eat-2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor exhibited reduced pumping, they also hyperstimulated peristalses. This hyperstimulation depends on crosstalk with the GAR-3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor in adjacent cells, and it contributes to the well-characterized dietary restriction and extended adult lifespan observed in eat-2 mutants.",

    "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) and source estimation can be used to identify brain areas activated during a task, which could offer greater insight on cortical dynamics. Source estimation requires knowledge of the locations of the EEG electrodes. This could be provided with a template or obtained by digitizing the EEG electrode locations. Operator skill and inherent uncertainties of a digitizing system likely produce a range of digitization reliabilities, which could affect source estimation and the interpretation of the estimated source locations. Here, we compared the reliability of five digitizing methods (ultrasound, structured-light 3D scan, infrared 3D scan, motion capture probe, and motion capture) and determined the relationship between digitization reliability and source estimation uncertainty, assuming other contributors to source estimation uncertainty were constant. We digitized a mannequin head using each method five times and quantified the reliability and validity of each method. We created five hundred sets of electrode locations based on our reliability results and applied a dipole fitting algorithm (DIPFIT) to perform source estimation. The motion capture method, which recorded the locations of markers placed directly on the electrodes had the best reliability with an average electrode variability of 0.001cm. Then, in order of decreasing reliability were the method using a digitizing probe in the motion capture system, an infrared 3D scanner, a structured-light 3D scanner, and an ultrasound digitization system. Unsurprisingly, uncertainty of the estimated source locations increased with greater variability of EEG electrode locations and less reliable digitizing systems. If EEG electrode location variability was ~ 1 cm, a single source could shift by as much as 2 cm. To help translate these distances into practical terms, we quantified Brodmann area accuracy for each digitizing method and found that the average Brodmann area accuracy for all digitizing methods was > 80%. Using a template of electrode locations reduced the Brodmann area accuracy to ~ 50%. Overall, more reliable digitizing methods can reduce source estimation uncertainty, but the significance of the source estimation uncertainty depends on the desired spatial resolution. For accurate Brodmann area identification, any of the digitizing methods tested can be used confidently.",

Current animal models of atherosclerosis do not recapitulate coronary plaque disruption, thrombosis and myocardial infarction occurring in human. Recently, we demonstrated that exposure of the heart to high pressure, by transverse aortic constriction (TAC), induced coronary lesions in ApoE-/- mice on chow diet.\n\nThe aim of this study was to characterize the magnitude and location of coronary lesions in ApoE-/- mice post-TAC, and to assess the susceptibility of coronary plaque to disruption, leading to myocardial events.\n\nHere we describe a reliable pathological condition in mice characterized by the development of coronary lesions and its progression leading to myocardial infarction, which better recapitulate human disease. Following TAC surgery, about 90% of ApoE-/- mice develop coronary lesions, especially in the left anterior descending artery, with 59% of the mice manifesting different magnitude of LAD stenosis. Myocardial events, identified in 74% of the mice, were mainly due to coronary plaque thrombosis and occlusion.\n\nThat TAC induces the development and progression of coronary lesions in ApoE-/- mice leading to myocardial events represents a novel and important tool to investigate the development of coronary lesions and its sequelae in a setting that better resemble human conditions.",

    "abstract": "The left ventricular (LV) end-systolic pressure volume relationship (ES; ESPVR) is the cornerstone of systolic LV function analysis. Recently, it became possible to measure 2D LV chamber shape during vena cava occlusion (VCO) with MRI. We used an improved level-set semi-automatic segmentation method (LSSM) to determine the effect of VCO on LV geometry, ES pressure area (PA) and ESPVR.\n\n10 healthy adult sheep were anesthetized. LV pressure transducer and inferior vena cava (IVC) balloon catheter were percutaneously inserted. Ferumoxytol (0.125 ml/kg iv; AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Waltham, MA) was given to enhance blood pool contrast. LV pressure and 2D retrospectively-gated cine MRI of LV cross sections 25 (Apex), 50 (Mid) and 75% (Base) of the distance from the apex to the base of the LV were obtained during separate IVC balloon inflations (VCO). LV pressure was digitally filtered and LV chamber segmented with the LSSM. Cross sectional area, major and minor axes, major axis orientation, ESPAR and ESPVR were calculated.\n\nThe LSSM had excellent reliability. All cross sections became more elliptical during VCO. The orientation (angle) of each major axis relative to the anterior RV insertion shifted during VCO. However, the orientation remained toward the septum. There was chamber collapse (LV area < 0.25 cm2) at the apical level during VCO (7 cases). ESPAR was non-linear at all levels. ESPVR was non-linear because of apical collapse.\n\nIn conclusion, MRI-based measurement of LV geometry, ESPAR and ESPVR during VCO is a valuable method that may lead to improved understanding of systolic LV function.\n\nNew and NoteworthyReal-time MRI was used to continuously measure the LV PA relationship as loading conditions were transiently varied in anesthetized sheep. All three examined cross-sections became more elliptical during VCO. The ESPAR were non-linear at all three cross-sections. Chamber collapse at the apical level during VCO resulted in a non-linear ESPVR. The heart contracted in a non-concentric manner during VCO which could inform modeling studies and elucidate mechanisms underlying LV adaptations to sudden load changes.",

    "abstract": "Motion perception is essential for visual guidance of behaviour and is known to be limited by both internal additive noise (arising from random fluctuations in neural activity), and by motion pooling (global integration of local motion signals across space). People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) display abnormalities in motion processing, which has been linked to both elevated noise and abnormal pooling. However, to date, the impact of a third limit - induced internal noise (internal noise that scales up with increases is external noise) - has not been investigated in motion perception of any group. Here, we describe a new double-pass motion direction discrimination paradigm that quantifies additive noise, induced noise, and motion pooling. We measure the impact of induced noise on direction discrimination, which we ascribe to fluctuations in decision-related variables. We report that internal noise is higher individuals with high ASD traits only on coarse but not fine motion direction discrimination tasks. However, we report no significant correlations between autism traits, and additive noise, induced noise or motion pooling, in either task. We conclude that internal noise may be higher in individuals with many ASD traits, and that the assessment of induced internal noise is a useful way of exploring decision-related limits on motion perception, irrespective of ASD traits.",

    "abstract": "The human angular gyrus (AG) is implicated in recollection, or our ability to retrieve detailed memory content from a specific study episode. Parallel work also highlights a key role of the AG in the representation of general knowledge and semantics. How these two lines of research converge remains unclear. The present fMRI experiment used a remember-know paradigm with famous and non-famous faces to test whether activity in the AG could be modulated by both task-specific recollection and general prior knowledge in the same participants. Increased BOLD activity in the left AG was observed during both recollection in the absence of prior knowledge (i.e., recollected > non-recollected or correctly rejected non-famous faces) and when prior knowledge was accessed in the absence of recollection (i.e., famous > non-famous correct rejections). This pattern was unique to the left AG, and was not present in any other regions of the lateral inferior parietal lobe. Furthermore, the response profile of the left AG was consistent with accounts of recollection strength. Recollection-related activity was greater for faces with longer exposures at encoding than those with shorter exposures and was greater for stimuli with prior knowledge than those without, despite prior knowledge being incidental to the recognition decision. Therefore, the left AG is recruited during the access of both task-specific recollection and general prior knowledge, with greater activity as the amount of retrieved information increases, irrespective of its episodic or semantic nature.\n\nSignificance StatementThe human angular gyrus (AG) is often implicated in our ability to remember past events. A separate line of research examining our ability to represent general knowledge has also highlighted the AG as a core region of interest. To reconcile these separate views of AG function, we used fMRI to test whether the human left AG was sensitive to remembering details from a specific study episode (i.e., recollection) or more general prior knowledge, within the same participants. Overall, activity in the left AG was sensitive to both recollection and prior knowledge, suggesting any complete functional account of the left AG during retrieval must consider its sensitivity to both kinds of mnemonic representations.",

    "abstract": "Endochondral ossification during long bone development and natural fracture healing initiates by mesenchymal cell condensation and is directed by local morphogen signals and mechanical cues. Here, we aimed to mimic these developmental conditions for regeneration of large bone defects. We hypothesized that engineered human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) condensations with in situ presentation of transforming growth factor-{beta}1 (TGF-{beta}1) and/or bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) from encapsulated microparticles would promote endochondral regeneration of critical-sized rat femoral bone defects in a manner dependent on the in vivo mechanical environment. Mesenchymal condensations induced bone formation dependent on morphogen presentation, with dual BMP-2 + TGF-{beta}1 fully restoring mechanical bone function by week 12. In vivo ambulatory mechanical loading, initiated at week 4 by delayed unlocking of compliant fixation plates, significantly enhanced the bone formation rate in the four weeks after load initiation in the dual morphogen group. In vitro, local presentation of either BMP-2 alone or BMP-2 + TGF-{beta}1 initiated endochondral lineage commitment of mesenchymal condensations, inducing both chondrogenic and osteogenic gene expression through SMAD3 and SMAD5 signaling. In vivo, however, endochondral cartilage formation was evident only in the BMP-2 + TGF-{beta}1 group and was enhanced by mechanical loading. The degree of bone formation was comparable to BMP-2 soaked on collagen but without the ectopic bone formation that limits the clinical efficacy of BMP-2/collagen. In contrast, mechanical loading had no effect on autograft-mediated repair. Together, this study demonstrates a biomimetic template for recapitulating developmental morphogenic and mechanical cues in vivo for tissue engineering.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryMimicking aspects of the cellular, biochemical, and mechanical environment during early limb development, chondrogenically-primed human mesenchymal stem cell condensations promoted functional healing of critical-sized femoral defects via endochondral ossification, and healing rate and extent was a function of the in vivo mechanical environment.",

We use antimicrobial susceptibility testing with a CV017 cdeAB-oprM mutant to show the products of these genes confers resistance to a variety of antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, a clinically important antibiotic. We also identified a related RND-family pump, cseAB-oprN, in the genome of CV017 and other C. subtsugae species, that is not present in other members of the Chromobacterium genus. We demonstrate that CdeAB-OprM and CseAB-OprN are both transcriptionally induced in CV017 cells treated with sub-lethal antibiotic concentrations and they are important for induction of tolerance to different antibiotics. While CdeAB-OprM has a broad antibiotic specificity, the CseAB-OprN system is highly specific for a ribosome-targeting antibiotic produced by the saprophytic bacterium Burkholderia thailandensis, bactobolin. Finally, we use a previously developed B. thailandensis-C. subtsugae CV017 co-culture model to demonstrate that adding sub-lethal bactobolin at the beginning of co-culture growth increases the ability of CV017 to compete with B. thailandensis in a manner that is dependent on the CseAB-OprN system. Our results provide new information on the antibiotic resistance mechanisms of Chromobacterium species and highlight the importance of efflux pumps during competition with other bacterial species.\n\nIMPORTANCEThis study describes two closely related efflux pumps in members of the Chromobacterium genus, which includes opportunistic but often-fatal pathogens and species with highly versatile metabolic capabilities. Efflux pumps remove antibiotics from the cell and are important for antibiotic resistance. One of these pumps is broadly distributed in the Chromobacterium genus and increases resistance to clinically relevant antibiotics. The other efflux pump is present only in Chromobacterium subtsugae and is highly specific for bactobolin, an antibiotic produced by the soil saprophyte Burkholderia thailandensis. We demonstrate these pumps can be activated to increase resistance by their antibiotic substrates, and that this activation is important for C. subtsugae to survive in a laboratory competition experiment with B. thailandensis. These results have implications for managing antibiotic-resistant Chromobacterium infections, bioengineering of Chromobacterium species, and for understanding the evolution of efflux pumps.",
