    "abstract": "Nucleosomal DNA sequences generally follow a well-known pattern with [~]10-bp periodic WW (where W is A or T) dinucleotides that oscillate in phase with each other and out of phase with SS (where S is G or C) dinucleotides. However, nucleosomes having a DNA sequence pattern inverse to the conventional one have not been systematically analyzed in eukaryotes. Here, we show that anti-WW/SS nucleosomes are widespread and exhibit a species- and context-specific distribution in the genomes. The enrichment of anti-WW/SS nucleosomes in mammalian genomes is positively correlated with RNA Pol II transcriptional levels, but negatively correlated with the presence of the periodic WW or SS sequence patterns. In addition, chromatin remodeling complexes have an impact on the abundance of anti-WW/SS nucleosomes. The data reveal distinct roles of cis- and trans-acting factors in the rotational positioning of nucleosomes between non-mammals and mammals. Implications of the anti-WW/SS sequence pattern for RNA Pol II transcription are discussed.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTraditional clustering approaches for gene expression data are not well adapted to address the complexity and heterogeneity of tumors, where small sets of genes may be aberrantly co-expressed in specific subsets of tumors. Biclustering algorithms that perform local clustering on subsets of genes and conditions help address this problem. We propose a graph-based Tunable Biclustering Algorithm (TuBA) based on a novel pairwise proximity measure, examining the relationship of samples at the extremes of genes expression profiles to identify similarly altered signatures.\n\nResultsTuBAs predictions are consistent in 3,940 Breast Invasive Carcinoma (BRCA) samples from three independent sources, employing different technologies for measuring gene expression (RNASeq and Microarray). Over 60% of biclusters identified independently in each dataset had significant agreement in their gene sets, as well as similar clinical implications. About 50% of biclusters were enriched in the ER-/HER2- (or basal-like) subtype, while more than 50% were associated with transcriptionally active copy number changes. Biclusters representing gene co-expression patterns in stromal tissue were also identified in tumor specimens.\n\nConclusionTuBA offers a simple biclustering method that can identify biologically relevant gene co-expression signatures not captured by traditional unsupervised clustering approaches. It complements biclustering approaches that are designed to identify constant or coherent submatrices in gene expression datasets, and outperforms them in identifying a multitude of altered transcriptional profiles that are associated with observed genomic heterogeneity of diseased states in breast cancer, both within and across tumor subtypes, a promising step in understanding disease heterogeneity, and a necessary first step in individualized therapy.",

    "abstract": "The BRCA2 tumor suppressor protein is involved in the maintenance of genome integrity through its role in homologous recombination. In mitosis, BRCA2 is phosphorylated by Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1). Here we describe how this phosphorylation contributes to the control of mitosis. We identified two highly conserved phosphorylation sites at S193 and T207 of BRCA2. Phosphorylated-T207 is a bona fide docking site for PLK1 as illustrated by the crystal structure of the BRCA2 peptide bound to PLK1 Polo-box domain. We found that BRCA2 bound to PLK1 forms a complex with the phosphatase PP2A and phosphorylated-BUBR1. Reducing BRCA2 binding to PLK1, as observed in BRCA2 breast cancer variants S206C and T207A, alters the tetrameric complex resulting in misaligned chromosomes, faulty chromosome segregation and aneuploidy. We thus reveal a direct role of BRCA2 in the alignment of chromosomes, distinct from its DNA repair function, with important consequences on chromosome stability. These findings may explain in part the aneuploidy observed in BRCA2-mutated tumors.",

Especially in the visual modality, an increasing number of studies show that prediction-related neural signals carry feature-specific information about the stimulus. This is less established in the auditory modality, in particular without bottom-up signals driving neural activity. We studied whether auditory predictions are sharply tuned to even carry tonotopic specific information. For this purpose, we conducted a Magnetoencephalography (MEG) experiment in which participants passively listened to sound sequences that varied in their regularity (i.e. entropy). Sound presentations were temporally predictable (3 Hz rate), but were occasionally omitted. Training classifiers on the random (high entropy) sound sequence and applying them to all conditions in a time-generalized manner, allowed us to assess whether and how carrier frequency specific information in the MEG signal is modulated according to the entropy level. We show that especially in an ordered (most predictable) sensory context neural activity during the anticipatory and omission periods contains carrier-frequency specific information. Overall our results illustrate in the human auditory system that prediction-related neural activity can be tuned in a tonotopically specific manner.",

    "abstract": "Network analysis helps us to understand how genes jointly affect biological functions. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) is a frequently used method to build gene co-expression networks. WGCNA may be calculated with signed or unsigned correlations, with both methods having strengths and weaknesses, but both methods fail to capture weak and moderate negative correlations, which may be important in gene regulation. Combining the advantages and removing the disadvantages of both methods in one analysis would be desirable. In this study, we present a combination of signed and unsigned WGCNA (csuWGCNA), which combines the signed and unsigned methods and improves the detection of negative correlations. We applied csuWGCNA in 14 simulated datasets, six ground truth datasets and two large human brain datasets. Multiple metrics were used to evaluate csuWGCNA at gene pair and gene module levels. We found that csuWGCNA provides robust module detection and captures more negative correlations than the other methods, and is especially useful for non-coding RNA such as microRNA (miRNA) and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). csuWGCNA enables detection of more informative modules with biological functions than signed or unsigned WGCNA, which enables discovery of novel gene regulation and helps interpretations in systems biology.",

To address this question, the genomes of 2,062 individuals, including 1,179 ancient humans, were reanalyzed to assess how frequencies of risk alleles and their homozygosity changed through space and time in Europe over the past 45,000 years. While the overall deleterious homozygosity has consistently decreased, risk alleles have steadily increased in frequency over that period of time. Those that increased most are associated with diseases such as asthma, Crohn disease, diabetes and obesity, which are highly prevalent in present-day populations. These findings may not run against the existence of local adaptations, but highlight the limitations imposed by drift and population dynamics on the strength of selection in purging deleterious mutations from human populations.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe average power of rhythmic neural responses as captured by MEG/EEG/LFP recordings is a prevalent index of human brain function. Increasing evidence questions the utility of trial-/group averaged power estimates however, as seemingly sustained activity patterns may be brought about by time-varying transient signals in each single trial. Hence, it is crucial to accurately describe the duration and power of rhythmic and arrhythmic neural responses on the single trial-level. However, it is less clear how well this can be achieved in empirical MEG/EEG/LFP recordings. Here, we extend an existing rhythm detection algorithm (extended Better OSCillation detection: \"eBOSC\"; cf. Whitten et al., 2011) to systematically investigate boundary conditions for estimating neural rhythms at the single-trial level. Using simulations as well as resting and task-based EEG recordings from a micro-longitudinal assessment, we show that alpha rhythms can be successfully captured in single trials with high specificity, but that the quality of single-trial estimates varies greatly between subjects. Despite those signal-to-noise-based limitations, we highlight the utility and potential of rhythm detection with multiple proof-of-concept examples, and discuss implications for single-trial analyses of neural rhythms in electrophysiological recordings. Using an applied example of working memory retention, rhythm detection indicated load-related increases in the duration of frontal theta and posterior alpha rhythms, in addition to a frequency decrease of frontal theta rhythms that was observed exclusively through amplification of rhythmic amplitudes.\n\nHighlightsO_LITraditional narrow-band rhythm metrics conflate the power and duration of rhythmic and arrhythmic periods. We extend a state-of-the-art rhythm detection method (eBOSC) to derive rhythmic episodes in single trials that can disambiguate rhythmic and arrhythmic periods.\nC_LIO_LISimulations indicate that this can be done with high specificity given sufficient rhythmic power, but with strongly impaired sensitivity when rhythmic SNR is low. Empirically, surface EEG recordings exhibit stable inter-individual differences in -rhythmicity in ranges where simulations suggest a gradual bias, leading to high collinearity between narrow-band and rhythm-specific estimates.\nC_LIO_LIBeyond these limitations, we highlight multiple empirical benefits of characterizing rhythmic episodes in single trials, such as (a) a principled separation of rhythmic and arrhythmic content, (b) an amplification of rhythmic amplitudes, and (c) a specific characterization of sustained and transient events.\nC_LIO_LIIn an exemplary application, rhythm-specific estimates increase sensitivity to working memory load effects, in addition to indicating a frequency modulation of frontal theta rhythms through the amplification of rhythmic power.\nC_LI",

Applying it to the Pf3k data set, we find that the rate of mixed infection varies from 29% to 63% across countries and that 51% of mixed infections involve more than two strains. Further-more, we estimate that 47% of symptomatic dual infections contain sibling strains likely to have been co-transmitted from a single mosquito, and find evidence of mixed infections propagated over successive infection cycles. Finally, leveraging data from the Malaria Atlas Project, we find that prevalence correlates within Africa, but not Asia, with both the rate of mixed infection and the level of IBD.",

In this work, we discuss the utility of this method to record calcium signals in brain tissue with two-photon frequency-division multiplexing (2P-FDM) microscopy. While frequency-multiplexed imaging appears slightly inferior in terms of image quality as compared to conventional two-photon laser scanning microscopy due to shot noise-induced cross-talk between frequency channels, applying this technique to record average signals from regions of interest (ROI) such as neuronal cell bodies was found to be promising. We use phase information associated with each pixel or waveform within a selected ROI to phase-align and recombine the signals into one extended amplitude-modulated waveform. This procedure narrows the frequency detection window, effectively decreasing noise contributions from other frequency channels. Using theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and in vitro imaging we demonstrate a reduction of cross-talk by more than an order of magnitude and predict the usefulness of 2P-FDM for functional studies of brain activity.",

    "abstract": "Natural conversation is multisensory: when we can see the speakers face, visual speech cues influence our perception of what is being said. The neuronal basis of this phenomenon remains unclear, though there is indication that phase modulation of neuronal oscillations--ongoing excitability fluctuations of neuronal populations in the brain--provides a mechanistic contribution. Investigating this question using naturalistic audiovisual speech with intracranial recordings in humans, we show that neuronal populations in auditory cortex track the temporal dynamics of unisensory visual speech using the phase of their slow oscillations and phase-related modulations in high-frequency activity. Auditory cortex thus builds a representation of the speech streams envelope based on visual speech alone, at least in part by resetting the phase of its ongoing oscillations. Phase reset could amplify the representation of the speech stream and organize the information contained in neuronal activity patterns.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWatching the speaker can facilitate our understanding of what is being said. The mechanisms responsible for this influence of visual cues on the processing of speech remain incompletely understood. We studied those mechanisms by recording the human brains electrical activity through electrodes implanted surgically inside the skull. We found that some regions of cerebral cortex that process auditory speech also respond to visual speech even when it is shown as a silent movie without a soundtrack. This response can occur through a reset of the phase of ongoing oscillations, which helps augment the response of auditory cortex to audiovisual speech. Our results contribute to discover the mechanisms by which the brain merges auditory and visual speech into a unitary perception.",

In the last few years, the number of strandings on Cape Cod Massachusetts beaches has increased by nearly an order of magnitude relative to preceding decades. This study uses a combination of ocean observations and a well-respected ocean model to investigate the causes and transport of cold-stunned animals in Cape Cod Bay. After validating the model using satellite-tracked drifters and local temperature moorings, ocean currents were examined in the Cape Cod Bay in an attempt to explain stranding locations as observed by volunteers and, for some years, backtracking was conducted to examine the potential source regions. The general finding, as expected, is that sub 10.5{degrees}C water temperatures in combination with persistent strong wind stress (>0.4Pa) will result in increased strandings along particular sections of the coast dependent on the wind direction. However, it is still uncertain where in the water column the majority of cold stunned turtles reside and, if many of them are on the surface, considerable more work will need to be done to incorporate the direct effects of wind and waves on the advective processes.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge integration based on the relationship between structure and function of the neural substrate is one of the main targets of neuroinformatics and data-driven computational modeling. However, the multiplicity of data sources, the diversity of benchmarks, the mixing of observables of different natures, and the necessity of a long-term, systematic approach make such a task challenging. Here we present a first snapshot of a long-term integrative modeling program designed to address this issue: a comprehensive spiking model of cat primary visual cortex satisfying an unprecedented range of anatomical, statistical and functional constraints under a wide range of visual input statistics. In the presence of physiological levels of tonic stochastic bombardment by spontaneous thalamic activity, the modeled cortical reverberations self-generate a sparse asynchronous ongoing activity that quantitatively matches a range of experimentally measured statistics. When integrating feed-forward drive elicited by a high diversity of visual contexts, the simulated network produces a realistic, quantitatively accurate interplay between visually evoked excitatory and inhibitory conductances; contrast-invariant orientation-tuning width; center surround interactions; and stimulus-dependent changes in the precision of the neural code. This integrative model offers numerous insights into how the studied properties interact, contributing to a better understanding of visual cortical dynamics. It provides a basis for future development towards a comprehensive model of low-level perception.\n\nSignificance statementComputational modeling can integrate fragments of understanding generated by experimental neuroscience. However, most previous models considered only a few features of neural computation at a time, leading to either poorly constrained models with many parameters, or lack of expressiveness in over-simplified models. A solution is to commit to detailed models, but constrain them with a broad range of anatomical and functional data. This requires a long-term systematic approach. Here we present a first snapshot of such an integrative program: a large-scale spiking model of V1, that is constrained by an unprecedented range of anatomical and functional features. Together with the associated modeling infrastructure, this study lays the groundwork for a broad integrative modeling program seeking an in-depth understanding of vision.",

    "abstract": "The effectiveness of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) placed over the motor hotspot (thought to represent the primary motor cortex (M1)) to modulate motor network excitability is highly variable. The premotor cortex--particularly the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd)--may be a promising alternative target to more effectively modulate motor excitability, as it influences motor control across multiple pathways, one independent of M1 and one with direct, modulating connections to M1. This double-blind, placebo-controlled study aimed to differentially excite motor and premotor regions using high-definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) with concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). HD-tDCS applied over either the motor hotspot or the premotor cortex demonstrated high inter-individual variability in changes on cortical motor excitability. However, HD-tDCS over the premotor cortex led to a higher number of responders and greater changes in local fMRI-based complexity than HD-tDCS over the motor hotspot. Furthermore, an analysis of individual motor hotspot anatomical locations revealed that, in more than half of the participants, the motor hotspot is not located over anatomical M1 boundaries, despite using a canonical definition of the motor hotspot. This heterogeneity in stimulation site may contribute to the variability of tDCS results. Altogether, these findings provide new considerations to enhance tDCS reliability.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsically generated patterns of coupled neuronal activity are associated with the dynamics of specific brain states. Sensory inputs are extrinsic factors that can perturb these intrinsic coupling modes, creating a complex scenario in which forthcoming stimuli are processed. Studying this intrinsic-extrinsic interplay is necessary to better understand perceptual integration and selection. Here, we show that this interplay leads to a reconfiguration of functional cortical connectivity that acts as a mechanism to facilitate stimulus processing. Using audiovisual stimulation in anesthetized ferrets, we found that this reconfiguration of coupling modes is context-specific, depending on long-term modulation by repetitive sensory inputs. These reconfigured coupling modes, in turn, lead to changes in latencies and power of local field potential responses that support multisensory integration. Our study demonstrates that this interplay extends across multiple time scales and involves different types of intrinsic coupling. These results suggest a novel large-scale mechanism that facilitates multisensory integration.",

    "abstract": "We have measured the orientation of the myosin light chain domain (lever arm) elements in demembranated muscle fibers by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), using a bifunctional spin label (BSL), with angular resolution of 4 degrees. Despite advances in X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), and fluorescence polarization, none of these techniques provide high-resolution structural information about the myosin light chain domain under ambient conditions in a muscle fiber. Two cysteines, 4 residues apart, were engineered on two -helices in the myosin regulatory light chain (RLC), permitting stereoselective site-directed labeling with BSL. One labeled helix (helix E) is adjacent to the myosin lever arm, the other helix (helix B) is located farther apart from the motor domain beyond the \"hinge\" of the myosin. By exchanging BSL-labeled RLC onto oriented muscle fibers, we obtained EPR spectra that determined angular distributions of BSL with high resolution, which enabled the accurate determination of helix orientation of individual structural elements with respect to the muscle fiber axis. In the absence of ATP (rigor), each of the two labeled helices exhibited both ordered ({sigma} ~ 9-11 degrees) and disordered ({sigma} > 38 degrees) populations. We used these angles to determine the orientation of the myosin lever arm, concluding that the oriented population has lever arms that are perpendicular to the muscle fiber axis. This orientation is ~33 degrees different than predicted from a standard \"lever arm down\" model based on cryo-EM of actin decorated with isolated myosin heads, but it is compatible with fluorescence polarization and EM data obtained from muscle fibers. The addition of ATP, in the absence of Ca2+, shifted the orientation to a much more disordered distribution.\n\nSummaryWe used electron paramagnetic resonance to determine the orientation of elements within the myosin regulatory light chain in skinned skeletal muscle fibers. A bifunctional spin label provided sufficient resolution to detect an ordered population of lever arms perpendicular to actin.",

HS rats are ideally suited for genome wide association studies; however, only a few genotyping microarrays have ever been designed for rats and none of them are currently in production. To address the need for an efficient and cost effective method of genotyping HS rats, we have adapted genotype-by-sequencing (GBS) to obtain genotype information at large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In this paper, we have outlined the laboratory and computational steps we took to optimize double digest genotype-by-sequencing (ddGBS) for use in rats. We also evaluate multiple existing computational tools and explain the workflow we have used to call and impute over 3.7 million SNPs. We also compared various rat genetic maps, which are necessary for imputation, including a recently developed map specific to the HS. Using our approach, we obtained concordance rates of 99% with data obtained using data from a genotyping array. The principles and computational pipeline that we describe could easily be adapted for use in other species for which reliable reference genome sets are available.",

Still, the same reasoning holds if we substitute \"brain activity\" with \"brain alteration\" and \"cognitive process\" with \"brain disorder\". To assess the involvement of a certain alteration pattern in a brain disorder we used the Bayes factor technique on voxel-based morphometry data of schizophrenia and Alzheimers disease. This technique allows to calculate the ratio between the likelihoods of two alternative hypotheses (in our case, that the alteration of the voxel is specific for the brain disorder under scrutiny or that the alteration is not specific). We then performed temporal simulations of the alteration spread associated with different pathologies. The Bayes factor values calculated on these simulated data were able to reveal that the areas which are more specific to a certain disease are also the ones to be early altered.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) play a central role in the regulation of gene expression, controlling everything from cell fate decisions to activity dependent gene expression. However, widely-used methods for TF profiling in vivo (e.g. ChIP-seq) yield only an aggregated picture of TF binding across all cell types present within the harvested tissue; thus, it is challenging or impossible to determine how the same TF might bind different portions of the genome in different cell types, or even to identify its binding events at all in rare cell types in a complex tissue such as the brain. Here we present a versatile methodology, FLEX Calling Cards, for the mapping of TF occupancy in specific cell types from heterogenous tissues. In this method, the TF of interest is fused to a hyperactive piggyBac transposase (hypPB), and this bipartite gene is delivered, along with donor transposons, to mouse tissue via a Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV). The fusion protein is expressed in Cre-expressing cells where it inserts transposon \"Calling Cards\" near to TF binding sites. These transposons permanently mark TF binding events and can be mapped using high-throughput sequencing. Alternatively, unfused hypPB interacts with and records the binding of the super enhancer (SE)-associated bromodomain protein, Brd4. To demonstrate the FLEX Calling Card method, we first show that donor transposon and transposase constructs can be efficiently delivered to the postnatal day 1 (P1) mouse brain with AAV and that insertion profiles report TF occupancy. Then, using a Cre-dependent hypPB virus, we show utility of this tool in defining cell type-specific TF profiles in multiple cell types of the brain. This approach will enable important cell type-specific studies of TF-mediated gene regulation in the brain and will provide valuable insights into brain development, homeostasis, and disease.",

Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is capable of resolving different cell types based on gene expression profiles, but no technology exists to directly link specific cell types to the binding pattern of TFs in those cell types. Here, we present self-reporting transposons (SRTs) and their use in single cell calling cards (scCC), a novel assay for simultaneously capturing gene expression profiles and mapping TF binding sites in single cells. First, we show how the genomic locations of SRTs can be recovered from mRNA. Next, we demonstrate that SRTs deposited by the piggyBac transposase can be used to map the genome-wide localization of the TFs SP1, through a direct fusion of the two proteins, and BRD4, through its native affinity for piggyBac. We then present the scCC method, which maps SRTs from scRNA-seq libraries, thus enabling concomitant identification of cell types and TF binding sites in those same cells. As a proof-of-concept, we show recovery of cell type-specific BRD4 and SP1 binding sites from cultured cells. Finally, we map Brd4 binding sites in the mouse cortex at single cell resolution, thus establishing a new technique for studying TF biology in situ.",

    "abstract": "Affective disorders such as major depression are common but serious illnesses characterized by altered processing of emotional information. Although the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms increase dramatically over the course of childhood and adolescence, much of our understanding of their neurobiological bases comes from work characterizing adults responses to static emotional information. As a consequence, relationships between depressive brain phenotypes and naturalistic emotional processing, as well as the manner in which these associations emerge over the lifespan, remain poorly understood. Here, we apply static and dynamic inter-subject correlation analyses to examine how brain function is associated with clinical and non-clinical depressive symptom severity in 112 children and adolescents (7-21 years old) who viewed an emotionally evocative clip from the film Despicable Me during functional MRI. Our results reveal that adolescents with greater depressive symptom severity exhibit atypical fMRI responses during movie viewing, and that this effect is stronger during less emotional moments of the movie. Furthermore, adolescents with more similar item-level depressive symptom profiles showed more similar brain responses during movie viewing. In contrast, childrens depressive symptom severity and profiles were unrelated to their brain response typicality or similarity. Together, these results indicate a developmental change in the relationships between brain function and depressive symptoms from childhood through adolescence. Our findings suggest that depressive symptoms may shape how the brain responds to complex emotional information in a dynamic manner sensitive to both developmental stage and affective context.",

We sought to determine whether this shared basis could be decomposed to identify genetic factors that are specific to depression. We analysed two sets of summary statistics from genome-wide association studies of depression (from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and 23andMe) and compared them to GWAS of neuroticism (from UK Biobank). First, we used a pairwise GWAS analysis to classify variants as associated with only depression, with only neuroticism, or with both. Second, we estimated partial genetic correlations to test whether the depressions genetic link with other phenotypes was explained by shared overlap with neuroticism. We found evidence that most genetic variants associated with depression are likely to be shared with neuroticism. The overlapping common genetic variance of depression and neuroticism was negatively genetically correlated with cognitive function and positively genetically correlated with several psychiatric disorders. We found that the genetic contributions unique to depression, and not shared with neuroticism, were correlated with inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and sleep patterns. Our findings demonstrate that, while genetic risk factors for depression are largely shared with neuroticism, there are also non-neuroticism related features of depression that may be useful for further patient or phenotypic stratification.",

We test the hypothesis that gene expression in females is constrained from evolving to its optimum level due to sexually antagonistic selection on males, by examining changes sex-biased gene expression in five obligate asexual species of stick insect, which do not produce males. We predicted that the transcriptome of asexual females would be feminized as asexual females do not experience any sexual conflict. Contrary to our prediction we find that asexual females feature masculinized gene expression, and hypothesise that this is due to shifts in female optimal gene expression levels following the suppression of sex.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundExperimental evolution of microbes often involves a serial transfer protocol, where microbes are repeatedly diluted by transfer to a fresh medium, starting a new growth cycle. This protocol has revealed that evolution can be remarkably reproducible, where microbes show parallel adaptations both on the level of the phenotype as well as the genotype. However, these studies also reveal a strong potential for divergent evolution, leading to diversity both between and within replicate populations. We here study how in silico evolved Virtual Microbe \"wild types\" (WTs) adapt to a serial transfer protocol to investigate both the generic evolutionary adaptation to such an environment which are independent of prior evolution, and the variety of ways in which the adaptation is implemented at the individual and ecosystem level.\n\nResultsWe show that all pre-evolved WTs evolve to anticipate the regularity of the serial transfer protocol by adopting a fine-tuned balance of growth and survival. We find that this anticipation can be done in a variety of ways, either by a single lineage or by several lineages in consort. Interestingly, replicate populations of the same WT initially show similar trajectories, but may subsequently diverge along a growth rate versus yield trade-off.\n\nConclusionsWe find that all our in silico WTs show the same anticipation effects -- fitting the periodicity of a serial transfer protocol -- but do so by a variety of mechanisms. Our results reveal new insights into the dynamics and relevant selection pressures in experimental evolution, but also highlight how, in an eco-evolutionary context, numerous mechanisms can evolve to the same end.",

We have automated the detection of these bouts and their discrete properties including bout sizes, rates, durations, and intensities. We have developed a hierarchically organized model of behavioral organization enabling analysis of relationships among Active/Inactive State properties and those of feeding, drinking and locomotor bouts. Robust and analogous patterns of interrelationships among these endophenotypes were found for feeding, drinking behaviors, and these differed markedly from those for locomotor behaviors. For feeding and drinking, patterns of reciprocal relationships were observed for pairs of endophenotypes at multiple hierarchical levels. Moreover, endophenotype variability was highest at lowest hierarchical levels progressively diminished at higher levels, so that variability of gross levels of food and water intake were much less than those of their lower level determinants. By contrast, interrelationships among locomotor endophenotypes differed markedly from those of ingestive behavior. Altogether, these findings raise the possibility that behavioral regulation of food and water intake may make an important contribution to the homeostatic maintenance of energy and volume balance.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR), a defense system against viruses found in bacteria, launched a new era in gene targeting. The key feature of this technique is the guiding of the endonuclease Cas9 by single guide RNAs (sgRNA) to specific sequences, where a DNA lesion is introduced to trigger DNA repair. The CRISPR/Cas9 system may be extremely relevant for gene therapy, but the technique needs improvement to become a safe and fully effective tool. The Cas9-induced double-strand break (DSB) is repaired by one of two pathways, the error-prone Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or the high-fidelity Homology Direct Repair (HDR). Shifting the repair of the DSB to HDR is challenging, given the efficiency of NHEJ. Here we describe an engineered protein approach to increase knock-in efficiency by promoting the relative increase in Cas9 activity in G2, the phase of the cell cycle where HDR is more active. Cas9 was fused to the degradation domain of proteins known to be degraded in G1. The activity of two chimeric proteins, Geminin-Cas9 and CyclinB2-Cas9, is demonstrated, as well as their cell-cycle-dependent degradation. The chimeras shifted the repair of the DSBs to the HDR repair pathway compared to the commonly used Cas9. The application of cell cycle specific degradation tags could pave the way for more efficient and secure gene editing applications of the CRISPR/Cas9 system.",

    "abstract": "Dysfunction of mitochondrial DNA replication machinery is a common cause of mitochondrial diseases. The minimal mammalian replisome is made up of DNA polymerase gamma, replicative helicase Twinkle, and single-stranded DNA binding protein. The replisome is localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane and serves as the site of mitochondrial DNA replication and mitochondrial fission. Recently, a sequence homolog of Twinkle was uncovered in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we characterized this homolog, twnk-1, and report that twnk-1 does not function as the primary mitochondrial DNA replicative helicase in this species, as loss of twnk-1 does not result in reduce mitochondrial DNA levels, or result in other expected mitochondrial dysfunctions such as reduced oxygen consumption rates, increased sensitivity to metabolic perturbations, or reduced muscle function. Instead, twnk-1 mutants have increased mitochondrial DNA as they age, and exhibit phenotypes associated with mitochondrial stress, including reduced fecundity, an activation of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response, and mitochondrial fragmentation. Our results suggest in Caenorhabditis elegans, twnk-1 does not function as the mitochondrial DNA replicative helicase, but has an alternative function in regulating mitochondrial function.",

We generated induced pluripotent stem cells from LS patients carrying homozygous SURF1 mutations (SURF1 iPS) and performed biallelic correction via CRISPR/Cas9. In contrast to corrected cells, SURF1 iPS showed impaired neuronal differentiation. Aberrant bioenergetics in SURF1 iPS occurred already in neural progenitor cells (NPCs), disrupting their neurogenic potency. Cerebral organoids from SURF1 iPS were smaller and recapitulated the neurogenesis defects. Our data imply that SURF1 mutations cause a failure in the development of maturing neurons.

    "abstract": "Obesity is a condition affecting many people in the world. Obese people have increased risks of developing chronic metabolic diseases such as type II diabetes, hypertension, cancer among others. Early and rapid diagnosis of the condition together with effective treatment is therefore necessary. This work investigated, first, Raman spectroscopic similarities between oxytocin and a freeze-dried extract of a local herbal plant exhibiting oxytocin-like properties called Uvariodendron anisatum Verdeck (Annonaceae) (UAV). Secondly, whether Raman spectroscopy could be used for comparative studies of the influence of oxytocin and UAV on diet induced obesity in Sprague Dawley (SD) rat models. We also sought for obesity or metabolic syndrome biomarker Raman spectral bands. Both oxytocin and extract samples together with blood extracted from the rats were excited using a 785 nm laser with conductive silver paste smeared glass slides as Raman sample substrates. It was found that Raman spectral profiles of oxytocin solution and UAV freeze dried extracts powder were identical with a cosine similarity value of 0.95 implying presence of similar Raman active molecules. The prominent peaks were those assigned to disulphide S-S stretching mode at 508 cm-1 and to tyrosine at 645 cm-1, 846 cm-1 and 1617 cm-1. Raman spectra of blood from oxytocin- and UAV-treated rats displayed similar profiles which were different from those of obese and non-obese (normal controls) animals. A prominent peak in spectra of treated rats centred at 401 cm-1 could be used as oxytocin biomarker band in blood. Comparison of average intensity trend of fructose bands at around 638 cm-1 and 812 cm-1 between prepared fructose solution and blood of treated rats, revealed elevated levels of fructose in blood of rats intraperitoneally injected oxytocin and UAV extracts. The result implied upregulation of fructose in oxytocin and UAV treated animals. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the Raman spectral profiles from blood of obese rats were different from those of non-obese rats. It also showed that spectra from oxytocin treated and UAV treated rats blood were similar indicating identical influence. The study shows the potential of Raman spectroscopy as tool for quick obesity (metabolic syndrome) screening with intensity of Raman bands associated with fructose acting as biomarkers. The same bands can also be used in comparative efficacy studies of anti-obesity drugs. Further studies are needed to validate these Raman spectroscopic results since, to the best of our knowledge, this was the first such investigation regarding comparison of UAV and conventional oxytocin together with their influence on obese SD rats. Weather human subjects exhibits similar results are also not known.",

Fish assemblages are a major component of marine foods webs. The macroevolution and biogeographic patterns of late Permian fish are currently insufficiently known. In this contribution, the late Permian fish fauna from K\u016bmas quarry (southern Latvia) is described for the first time. As a result, the studied late Permian Latvian assemblage consisted of isolated chondrichthyan teeth of Helodus sp., ?Acrodus sp., ?Omanoselache sp. and euselachian type dermal denticles as well as many osteichthyan scales of the Haplolepidae and Elonichthydae; numerous teeth of Palaeoniscus, rare teeth findings of ?Platysomus sp. and many indeterminate microremains. This ichthyofaunal assemblage is very similar to the contemporaneous Lopingian complex of the carbonate formation from the Karp\u0117nai quarry (northern Lithuania), despite the fact that K\u016bmas samples include higher diversity and abundance in fossil remains. The differences in abundance of microremains could possibly be explained by a fresh water influx in the northeastern Zechstein Basin margin, which probably reduced the salinity of the sea water. The new data enable a better understanding of the poorly known late Permian fish diversity from the Lithuania-Latvia Region.View Full Text",

We evaluated the impact of a short-term Westernized diet (WD) exposure on systemic plasma metabolomic changes in a cohort of adult male baboons. In this pilot study, five male baboons (n=5) raised and maintained on a standard monkey chow diet (high complex carbohydrates, low fat) were exposed to a challenge WD (high in saturated fats and simple carbohydrates) for 7 weeks (49 d), followed by a 57-day washout period on monkey chow (106 d). In addition to monitoring clinical measures, we used a comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (2D GC-ToF-MS) platform to assess the metabolomic changes in plasma at three time points. Twenty-three metabolites were changed in response to the WD (49 d), but the response across the animals was highly variable. All animals presented a very different metabolic profile than at baseline (0 d), and the washout period resulted in a relatively homogenous metabolic state across all animals. A short-term exposure to a WD led to long-term changes in the metabolic profile, suggesting a \"reset\" of the metabolic program.",

    "abstract": "How muscles are used is a key to understanding the internal driving of fish swimming. However, the underlying mechanisms of some features of the muscle activation patterns and their differential appearance on different species are still obscure. In this study, we explain the muscle activation patterns by using 3D computational fluid dynamics models coupled to the motion of fish with prescribed deformation and examining the torque and power required along the fish body with two primary swimming modes. We find that the torque required by the hydrodynamic forces and body inertia exhibits a wave pattern that travels faster than the curvature wave in both anguilliform and carangiform swimmers, which can explain the traveling wave speeds of the muscle activations. Most interestingly, intermittent negative power (i.e., power delivered by the fluid to the body) on the posterior part, along with a timely transfer of torque and energy by tendons, explains the decrease of the duration of muscle activation towards the tail. The torque contribution from the body elasticity further solves the mystery of the wave speed increase or the reverse of the wave direction of the muscle activation on the posterior part of a carangiform swimmer. For anguilliform swimmers, the absence of the changes mentioned above in the muscle activation on the posterior part is in line with our torque prediction and the absence of long tendons from experimental observations. These results provide novel insights into the function of muscles and tendons as an integrative part of the internal driving system, especially from an energy perspective, and highlight the differences in the internal driving systems between the two primary swimming modes.\n\nAuthor summaryFor undulatory swimming, fish form posteriorly traveling waves of body bending by activating their muscles sequentially along the body. However, experimental observations have showed that the muscle activation wave does not simply match the bending wave. Researchers have previously computed the torque required for muscles along the body based on classic hydrodynamic theories and explained the higher wave speed of the muscle activation compared to the curvature wave. However, the origins of other features of the muscle activation pattern and their variation among different species are still obscure after decades of research. In this study, we use 3D computational fluid dynamics models to compute the spatiotemporal distributions of both the torque and power required for eel-like and mackerel-like swimming. By examining both the torque and power patterns and considering the energy transfer, storage, and release by tendons and body viscoelasticity, we can explain not only the features and variations in the muscle activation patterns as observed from fish experiments but also how tendons and body elasticity save energy. We provide a mechanical picture in which the body shape, body movement, muscles, tendons, and body elasticity of a mackerel (or similar) orchestrate to make swimming efficient.",

The solution to this problem depends on the sizes of the vesicle and the cargo. We present here the computational results that determine the maximum theoretical capacity of a range of biologically relevant cargo in a variety of meaningful vesicle sizes.

    "abstract": "Mutational robustness quantifies the effect of random mutations on fitness. When mutational robustness is high, most mutations do not change fitness or have only a minor effect on it. From the point of view of fitness landscapes, robust genotypes form neutral networks of almost equal fitness. Using deterministic population models it has been shown that selection favors genotypes inside such networks, which results in increased mutational robustness. Here we demonstrate that this effect is massively enhanced by recombination. Our results are based on a detailed analysis of mesa-shaped fitness landscapes, where we derive precise expressions for the dependence of the robustness on the landscape parameters for recombining and non-recombining populations. In addition, we carry out numerical simulations on different types of random holey landscapes as well as on an empirical fitness landscape. We show that the mutational robustness of a genotype generally correlates with its recombination weight, a new measure that quantifies the likelihood for the genotype to arise from recombination. We argue that the favorable effect of recombination on mutational robustness is a highly universal feature that may have played an important role in the emergence and maintenance of mechanisms of genetic exchange.\n\nAuthor summaryTwo long-standing and seemingly unrelated puzzles in evolutionary biology concern the ubiquity of sexual reproduction and the robustness of organisms against genetic perturbations. Using a theoretical approach based on the concept of a fitness landscape, in this article we argue that the two phenomena may in fact be closely related. In our setting the hereditary information of an organism is encoded in its genotype, which determines it to be either viable or non-viable, and robustness is defined as the fraction of mutations that maintain viability. Previous work has demonstrated that the purging of non-viable genotypes from the population by natural selection leads to a moderate increase in robustness. Here we show that genetic recombination acting in combination with selection massively enhances this effect, an observation that is largely independent of how genotypes are connected by mutations. This suggests that the increase of robustness may be a major driver underlying the evolution of sexual recombination and other forms of genetic exchange throughout the living world.",

Here, we combine structure-guided chemical elaboration, protein mutagenesis and cellular assays to define the structural features that underlie the biochemical and cellular activities of Bractoppin. Bractoppin fails to bind mutant forms of BRCA1 tBRCT bearing single residue substitutions that alter K1702, a key residue mediating phosphopeptide recognition (K1702A), or alter hydrophobic residues (F1662R or L1701K) that adjoin the pSer-recognition site. However, mutation of BRCA1 tBRCT residue M1775R, which engages the Phe residue in the consensus phosphopeptide motif pSer-X-X-Phe, does not affect Bractoppin binding. Collectively, these findings confirm a binding mode for Bractoppin that blocks the phosphopeptide-binding site via structural features distinct from the substrate phosphopeptide. We explored these structural features through structure-guided chemical elaboration of Bractoppin, synthesizing analogs bearing modifications on the left and right hand side (LHS/RHS) of Bractoppins benzimidazole ring. Characterization of these analogs in biochemical assay reveal structural features underlying potency. Analogs where the LHS phenyl is replaced by cyanomethyl (2091) and 4-methoxyphenoxypropyl (2113) conceptualized from structure-guided strategies like GIST and dimer interface analysis expose the role of phenyl and isopropyl as critical hydrophobic anchors. Two Bractoppin analogs, 2088 and 2103 were effective in abrogating BRCA1 foci formation and inhibiting G2 arrest induced by irradiation of cells. Collectively, our findings reveal structural features underlying the biochemical and cellular activity of a novel benzimidazole inhibitor of phosphopeptide recognition by the BRCA1 tBRCT domain, providing fresh insights to guide the development of inhibitors that target the protein-protein interactions of this previously undrugged family of protein domains.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is a vascular disease, where aortic wall degradation is mediated by accumulated immune cells. Though cytokines regulate the inflammatory milieu within the aortic wall, their contribution to AAA through distant alterations, particularly in the control of hematopoietic stem cells proliferation and myeloid cell differentiation remains poorly defined. Here we report an unexpected pathogenic role for interleukin-27 receptor (IL-27R) in AAA development as genetic inactivation of IL-27R protected mice from AAA induced by Angiotensin (Ang) II. The mitigation of AAA in IL-27R deficient mice is associated with a blunted accumulation of myeloid cells in suprarenal aortas due to the surprising attenuation of Ang II-induced expansion of HSCs. The loss of IL-27R engages transcriptional programs that promote HSCs quiescence and suppresses myeloid lineage differentiation, decreasing mature cell production and myeloid cell accumulation in the aorta.\n\nWe, therefore, illuminate how a prominent vascular disease can be distantly driven by cytokine dependent regulation of the bone marrow precursors.",

    "abstract": "Studies in cattle show CD8 cytotoxic T cells (CTL), with the ability to kill intracellular bacteria, develop following stimulation of monocyte-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells (mdPBMC) with conventional dendritic cells (cDC) and monocyte-derived DC (MoDC) pulsed with MMP, a membrane protein from Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map) encoded by MAP2121c. CTL activity was diminished if CD4 T cells were depleted from mdPBMC before antigen (Ag) presentation by cDC and MoDC, suggesting simultaneous cognate recognition of MMP epitopes presented by MHC I and MHC II molecules might be essential for development of CTL activity. To clarify whether cognate recognition is essential for CTL development, studies were conducted with mdPBMC cultures in the presence of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for MHC class I and MHC class II molecules. The CTL response of mdPBMC to MMP-pulsed DC was completely blocked in the presence of mAbs to both MHC I and II molecules and also blocked in the presence of mAbs to either MHC I or MHC II. The results demonstrate CD4 T-cell help is essential for development of a primary CTL response to MMP, and indicate that cognate recognition is required for delivery of CD4 T-cell help during priming. Of importance, the findings provide support for the importance of CD4 and CD8 T-cell cognate antigen recognition in eliciting CTL responses to vaccines against intracellular pathogens. The methods described herein can be used to elucidate the intracellular interactions between lymphocytes and DC in humans and cattle.",

Se-5HTR, a specific receptor of serotonin, has been identified in the beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua. It is classified into subtype 7 among known 5HTRs. Se-5HTR was expressed in all developmental stages of S. exigua. It was expressed in all tested tissues of larval stage.

    "abstract": "The expression of key defense genes was detected in roots and leaves of tomato plants until the 12th day after treatments with a mixture of beneficial bio-control agents (BCAs), as soil-drenches. The expression of the same genes was monitored in pretreated plants at the 3rd and 7th day since the inoculation with the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita. Genes dependent on SA-signaling, such as the Pathogenesis Related Genes, PR1, PR3, and PR5, were systemically over-expressed at the earliest stages of BCA-root interaction. BCA pre-treatment primed plants against root-knot nematodes. The expression of PR-genes and of the gene encoding for the enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) oxidase (ACO), which catalyzes the last step of ethylene biosynthesis, was systemically enhanced after nematode inoculation in primed plants. Defense related enzyme activities, such as endochitinase and glucanase, were higher in roots of BCA-treated than in those of untreated plants, as well. On the contrary, the expression of genes dependent on JA/ET-signaling, such as Jasmonate Ethylene Response Factor 3 (JERF3), did not increase after nematode inoculation in primed plants. The antioxidant system, as indicated by catalase gene expression and ascorbate peroxidase activity, was repressed in infected colonized roots. Therefore, Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR), and not Induced Systemic Resistance (ISR), is proposed as the molecular signaling that is activated by BCA priming at the earliest stages of root-nematode interaction. Such BCA-induced activation of the plant immune system did not directly act against nematode motile juveniles penetrating and moving inside the roots. It resulted in a drastically decreased number of sedentary individuals and, then, in an augmented ability of the plants to contrast feeding site building by invasive juveniles.",

Satellite transmitters were attached in 2018 to six Atlantic green turtles nesting on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea, to track their post-nesting movements and locate their foraging grounds. Track lengths of 20-198 days were analyzed, for a total of 536 movement days for the six turtles. Migratory pathways and foraging grounds were identified by applying a switching state space model to locational data, which provides daily position estimates to identify shifts between migrating and foraging behavior. Turtles exhibited a combination of coastal and oceanic migrations pathways that ranged from 957 km to 1,131 km. Of the six turtles, five completed their migration and maintained residency at the same foraging ground near the coastal waters of Accra, Ghana until transmission was lost. These five resident turtles inhabit heavily fished and polluted waters and are vulnerable to a variety of anthropogenic threats. The identification of these foraging grounds highlights the importance of these coastal waters for the protection of the endangered Atlantic green turtle.",

    "abstract": "SUMO proteases are encoded by a large gene family in rice and are a potential source of specificity within the SUMO system that is responding to different environmental cues. We previously demonstrated a critical role of OsOTS class of SUMO proteases in salt and drought stress in rice by silencing several family members collectively via RNAi methods. However, to date it has not been possible to assign a role to specific family members due to limitations of RNAi mediated off target silencing across several members of the gene family. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated endonuclease 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system has emerged as a promising technology for specific gene editing in crop plants. Here, we demonstrate targeted mutagenesis of OsOTS1 in rice using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system in the rice cultivar Kitaake. Guide RNA mediated mutations in OsOTS1 was highly efficient with almost 95% of T0 transgenics showing the desired effect with no off-target mutations. The OsOTS1 mutations observed in T0 generation were heritable in subsequent generations. OsOTS1 CRISPR lines show enhanced sensitivity to salt with reduced root and shoot biomass indicating that OsOTS1 has a major role in salt stress tolerance in rice. This unexpected finding indicates that precise and effective genome editing can be used to characterise specificity within the SUMO system in rice.",

We recruited and administered the self-reported HDQ, seven criterion measures, and a demographic questionnaire with adults living with HIV accessing HIV care. We determined median and interquartile ranges (IQR) for disability presence, severity and episodic scores (range 0-100). We calculated Cronbachs alpha () Kuder-Richardson-20 (KR-20) statistics for disability and episodic scores respectively (internal consistency reliability), smallest detectable change (SDC) for each HDQ severity item and domain (precision), and tested 36 a priori hypotheses assessing correlations between HDQ and criterion scores (construct validity).\n\nResultsOf N=243 participants, all were male, median age 40 years, 94% currently taking antiretroviral therapy, and 22% living with [&ge;]2 concurrent health conditions. Median HDQ domain scores ranged from 0 (IQR: 0,7) (difficulties with day-to-day activities domain) to 27 (IQR: 14, 41) (uncertainty domain). Cronbachs alpha for the HDQ severity scale ranged from 0.85 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.80-0.90) in the cognitive domain to 0.93 (95%CI: 0.91-0.94) in the mental-emotional domain. The KR-20 statistic for the HDQ episodic scale ranged from 0.74 (95%CI: 0.66-0.83) in the cognitive domain to 0.91 (95%CI: 0.89-0.94) in the uncertainty domain. SDC ranged from 7.3-15.0 points on the HDQ severity scale for difficulties with day-to-day activities and cognitive symptoms domains, respectively. The majority of the construct validity hypotheses (n=30/36, 83%) were confirmed.\n\nConclusionsThe HDQ possesses internal consistency reliability and construct validity with varied precision when administered to males living with HIV in London, UK. Clinicians and researchers may use the HDQ to measure the nature and extent of disability experienced by PLHIV in the UK, and to inform HIV service provision to address the health-related challenges among PLHIV.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas9 systems have been effectively harnessed to engineer the genomes of organisms from across the tree of life. Nearly all currently characterized Cas9 proteins are derived from mesophilic bacteria, and canonical Cas9 systems are challenged by applications requiring enhanced stability or elevated temperatures. We discovered IgnaviCas9, a Cas9 protein from a hyperthermophilic Ignavibacterium identified through mini-metagenomic sequencing of samples from a hot spring. IgnaviCas9 is active at temperatures up to 100 {degrees}C in vitro, which enables DNA cleavage beyond the 44 {degrees}C limit of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpyCas9) and the 70 {degrees}C limit of both Geobacillus stearothermophilus Cas9 (GeoCas9) and Geobacillus thermodenitrificans T12 Cas9 (ThermoCas9). As a potential application of this enzyme, we demonstrated that IgnaviCas9 can be used in bacterial RNA-seq library preparation to remove unwanted cDNA from 16s ribosomal rRNA (rRNA) without increasing the number of steps, thus underscoring the benefits provided by its exceptional thermostability in improving molecular biology and genomic workflows. Taken together, IgnaviCas9 is an exciting addition to the CRISPR-Cas9 toolbox and expands its temperature range.",

    "abstract": "Classical models of cerebellar learning posit that climbing fibers operate according to a supervised learning rule to instruct changes in motor output by signaling the occurrence of movement errors. However, cerebellar output is also associated with non-motor behaviors, and recently with modulating reward association pathways in the VTA. To test how the cerebellum processes reward related signals in the same type of classical conditioning behavior typically studied to evaluate reward processing in the VTA and striatum, we have used calcium imaging to visualize instructional signals carried by climbing fibers across the lateral cerebellum before and after learning. We find distinct climbing fiber responses in three lateral cerebellar regions that can each signal reward prediction, but not reward prediction errors per se. These instructional signals are well suited to guide cerebellar learning based on reward expectation and enable a cerebellar contribution to reward driven behaviors.",

Bats are an important component of vertebrate diversity in many terrestrial landscapes where they provide invaluable and important ecosystem services to human societies such as insect pest control, pollination and seed dispersal. Here we study bat diversity and abundance in three landscapes representing a transformational gradient (continuous forests, forest fragments and crops) in an Andean agricultural scenario known as Colombias \"Coffee Cultural Landscape\". We captured 1146 bats from 32 species and 4 families. The bat diversity and abundance in this landscape were high, especially for frugivorous bats, but there were no differences among the three transformational landscapes. However, some species were captured differentially between landscapes, suggesting that these landscapes have characteristics that influence the relative abundance of bats. Additionally, body weight and sex affect the abundance of some species in forest fragments and crops.",

    "abstract": "Tau is one of the two pathological hallmarks of Alzheimers disease, and bears a much closer relationship to local neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment than the other hallmark, {beta}-amyloid. Cell and rodent models have shown evidence that tau spreads from cell to cell through anatomical neuronal connections, and that this process is facilitated by the presence of {beta}-amyloid. We test this hypothesis in humans by using an epidemic spreading model (ESM) to simulate the spread of tau over human neuronal connections, and we compare the simulated pattern of progression to the observed pattern measured in the brains of 312 individuals on the Alzheimers disease spectrum, using PET. Fitting our model, we found that the majority of variance in the overall pattern of tau progression could be explained by diffusion of an agent through the human connectome, measured using either functional connectivity or diffusion tractography. These models far exceeded chance, and outperformed models testing the extracellular spread of tau over Euclidian space. Surprisingly, the ESM predicted the spatial patterns of tau irrespective of whether subjects demonstrated evidence for brain {beta}-amyloid. In addition, in {beta}-amyloid-positive subjects only, regions with greater amyloid burden showed greater tau than predicted by connectivity patterns, suggesting a role of amyloid in accelerating the spread of tau in certain isocortical regions. Altogether, our results provide strong evidence that tau spreads through neuronal communication pathways even in normal aging, and that this process is accelerated by the presence of brain {beta}-amyloid.",

A basal land plant, Marchantia polymorpha, develops clonal propagules, gemmae, in a specialized receptacle, gemma cup. Here we report an R2R3-MYB transcription factor, designated GEMMA CUP-ASSOCIATED MYB 1 (GCAM1), which is an essential regulator of gemma cup development in M. polymorpha. Although gemma cups are a characteristic gametophyte organ for vegetative reproduction in a taxonomically restricted group of liverwort species, phylogenetic and interspecific complementation analyses supported the orthologous relationship of GCAM1 to regulatory factors for axillary meristem formation, e.g. Arabidopsis RAXs and tomato Blind, in angiosperm sporophytes.

Whether crop yield-related ecosystem services can be maintained by few abundant species or rely on high richness remains unclear. Using a global database from 89 crop systems, we partition the relative importance of abundance and species richness for pollination, biological pest control and final yields in the context of on-going land-use change. Pollinator and enemy richness directly supported ecosystem services independent of abundance. Up to 50% of the negative effects of landscape simplification on ecosystem services was due to richness losses of service-providing organisms, with negative consequences for crop yields. Maintaining the biodiversity of ecosystem service providers is therefore vital to sustain the flow of key agroecosystem benefits to society.",

    "abstract": "Following reovirus infection, cells activate stress responses that repress canonical cellular translation as a mechanism to limit production of progeny virions. This includes the formation of stress granules (SG) that sequester translationally-stalled cellular transcripts, translation initiation factors, ribosomal proteins, and RNA binding proteins until conditions improve and translation can resume. Work by others suggests that these cellular stress responses, which are part of the integrated stress response, may benefit rather than repress reovirus replication. In agreement with this, we report that stressing cells prior to infection with sodium arsenite (SA), a robust inducer of SG and activator of eIF2 kinases, enhanced viral protein expression, percent infectivity and viral titer in SA-treated cells compared to untreated cells. SA-mediated enhancement of reovirus replication was not strain-specific, but was cell-type specific. While pre-treatment of cells with SA offered the greatest enhancement, treatment of infected cultures as late as 4 h post infection resulted in an increase in the percent of cells infected. SA activates the HRI kinase, which phosphorylates eIF2 and subsequently induces SG formation. Other stresses, such as heat shock (HS) and osmotic shock also activate HRI. Heat shock of cells prior to reovirus infection readily induced SG in greater than 85% of cells. Although HS pre-treatment had no effect on the percentage of infected cells or viral yield, it did enhance viral protein expression. These data suggest that SA pre-treatment perturbs the cell in a way that is beneficial for reovirus and that neither HRI activation nor SG induction is sufficient for reovirus infection enhancement.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEAll viruses rely on the host translational machinery for the synthesis of viral proteins. In response to viral infection, cells activate the integrated stress response resulting in the phosphorylation of eIF2 and translation shutoff. Despite this, reovirus replicates to reduced titers in the absence of this response. In this work, we report that sodium arsenite activation of the integrated stress response prior to virus inoculation enhances virus infectivity, protein expression and titer. Together, these data suggest that modulation of conserved cellular stress responses can alter reovirus replication.",

    "abstract": "Neural activity fluctuates over time, creating considerable variability across trials. This trial-by-trial neural variability is dramatically reduced (\"quenched\") after the presentation of sensory stimuli. Likewise, the power of neural oscillations, primarily in the alpha-beta band, is also reduced. Despite their similarity, these phenomena have been discussed independently. We hypothesized that the two phenomena are tightly coupled. To test this, we examined magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings of healthy subjects viewing repeated presentations of a visual stimulus. The timing, amplitude, and spatial topography of variability-quenching and power suppression were remarkably similar. Neural variability quenching was eliminated by excluding the alpha-beta band from the recordings, but not by excluding other frequency-bands. Moreover, individual magnitudes of alpha-beta band power explained 86% of between-subject differences in variability quenching. In contrast, inter-trial-phase-coherence (ITPC) was not correlated with variability quenching. These results reveal that neural variability quenching reflects stimulus-induced changes in the power of alpha-beta band oscillations.",

    "abstract": "Movements toward rewarding stimuli exhibit greater vigor, i.e., increased velocity and reduced reaction-times. This invigoration may be due to release of dopamine before movement onset. Dopamine release is strongly modulated by reward prediction error (RPE). Here, we generated an RPE event in the milliseconds before movement onset and tested whether there was a causal relationship between RPE and vigor. Human subjects made saccades toward an image. During the execution of their primary saccade, we probabilistically changed the position and content of the image. This led to a secondary saccade following completion of the primary saccade. We focused on properties of this secondary saccade. On some trials, the content of the secondary image was more valuable than the first image, resulting in a +RPE event that preceded the secondary saccade. On other trials, this content was less valuable, resulting in a -RPE event. We found that reaction-time and velocity of the secondary saccade were affected in an orderly fashion by the magnitude and direction of the preceding RPE event: the most vigorous saccades followed the largest +RPE, whereas the least vigorous saccades followed the largest -RPE. Presence of the secondary saccade indicated that the primary saccade had experienced a movement error, inducing trial-to-trial adaptation: the subsequent primary saccade was changed in the direction of the movement error in the previous trial. However, motor learning from error was not affected by the RPE event. Therefore, reward prediction error, and not reward per se, modulated vigor of saccades.\n\nAuthor summaryDoes dopamine release before onset of a movement modulate vigor of the ensuing movement? To test this hypothesis, we relied on the fact that RPE is a strong modulator of dopamine. Our innovation was a task in which an RPE event occurred precisely before onset of a movement. We probabilistically produced a combination of large or small, negative or positive RPE events before onset of a saccade, and observed that the vigor of the saccade that followed carried a robust signature of the preceding RPE event: high vigor saccades followed +RPE events, while low vigor saccades followed -RPE events. This suggests that control of vigor is partly through release of dopamine in the moments before onset of the movement.",

The intestinal epithelium requires oxygen for viability, while gut bacteria are facultative or obligate anaerobes. The ability to model host-commensal interactions under dynamic oxygen conditions is critical to understanding host-pathogen interactions in the human gut. Here, we demonstrate a simple, cost-effective method for co-culturing obligate anaerobic bacteria with human intestinal enteroid monolayers under variable oxygen conditions. The Enteroid-Anaerobe Co-Culture (EACC) system is able to recapitulate the steep oxygen gradient seen in vivo and induce expression of hypoxia-associated phenotypes such as increased barrier integrity and expression of antimicrobial peptide genes. Using clinical strains of the commensal anaerobes Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Blautia sp. on established patient-derived intestinal enteroid cell lines under physiological hypoxia, the EACC system can sustain host-anaerobe interactions for at least 24 hours. Following co-culture with anaerobic bacteria, we demonstrate patient-specific differences in epithelial response, reinforcing the potential to develop a personalized medicine approach to bacteriotherapy and host-microbe interaction investigations. Our innovative EACC system provides a robust model for investigating host-microbe interactions in complex, patient-derived intestinal tissues, that facilitates study of mechanisms underlying the role of the microbiome in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Species richness varies considerably among the tree of life which can only be explained by heterogeneous rates of diversification (speciation and extinction). Previous approaches use phylogenetic trees to estimate branch-specific diversification rates. However, all previous approaches disregard diversification-rate shifts on extinct lineages although 99% of species that ever existed are now extinct. Here we describe a lineage-specific birth-death-shift process where lineages, both extant and extinct, may have heterogeneous rates of diversification. To facilitate probability computation we discretize the base distribution on speciation and extinction rates into k rate categories. The fixed number of rate categories allows us to extend the theory of state-dependent speciation and extinction models (e.g., BiSSE and MuSSE) to compute the probability of an observed phylogeny given the set of speciation and extinction rates. To estimate branch-specific diversification rates, we develop two independent and theoretically equivalent approaches: numerical integration with stochastic character mapping and data-augmentation with reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. We validate the implementation of the two approaches in RevBayes using simulated data and an empirical example study of primates. In the empirical example, we show that estimates of the number of diversification-rate shifts are, unsurprisingly, very sensitive to the choice of prior distribution. Instead, branch-specific diversification rate estimates are less sensitive to the assumed prior distribution on the number of diversification-rate shifts and consistently infer an increased rate of diversification for Old World Monkeys. Additionally, we observe that as few as 10 diversification-rate categories are sufficient to approximate a continuous base distribution on diversification rates. In conclusion, our implementation of the lineage-specific birth-death-shift model in RevBayes provides biologists with a method to estimate branch-specific diversification rates under a mathematically consistent model.",

    "abstract": "The terrestrial deep subsurface is host to significant and diverse microbial populations. However, these microbial populations remain poorly characterized, partially due to the inherent difficulty of sampling, in situ studies, and isolating of the in situ microbes. Motivated by the ability of microbes to gain energy from redox reactions at mineral interfaces, we here present in situ electrochemical colonization (ISEC) as a method to directly study microbial electron transfer activity and to enable the capture and isolation of electrochemically active microbes. We installed a potentiostatically controlled ISEC reactor containing four working electrodes 1500 m below the surface at the Sanford Underground Research Facility. The working electrodes were poised at different redox potentials, spanning anodic to cathodic, to mimic energy-yielding mineral reducing and oxidizing reactions predicted to occur at this site. We present a 16S rRNA analysis of the in situ electrode-associated microbial communities, revealing the dominance of novel bacterial lineages under cathodic conditions. We also demonstrate that the in situ electrodes can be further used for downstream electrochemical laboratory enrichment and isolation of novel strains. Using this workflow, we isolated Bacillus, Anaerospora, Comamonas, Cupriavidus, and Azonexus strains from the electrode-attached biomass. Finally, the extracellular electron transfer activity of the electrode-oxidizing Comamonas strain (isolated at -0.19 V vs. SHE and designated WE1-1D1) and the electrode-reducing Bacillus strain (isolated at +0.53 V vs. SHE and designated WE4-1A1-BC) were confirmed in electrochemical reactors. Our study highlights the utility of in situ electrodes and electrochemical enrichment workflows to shed light on microbial activity in the deep terrestrial subsurface.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEA large section of microbial life resides in the deep subsurface, but an organized effort to explore this deep biosphere has only recently begun. A detailed characterization of the resident microbes remains scientifically and technologically challenging due to difficulty in access, sampling, and emulating the complex interactions and energetic landscapes of subsurface communities with standard laboratory techniques. Here we describe an in situ approach that exploits the ability of many microbes to perform extracellular electron transfer to/from solid surfaces such as mineral interfaces in the terrestrial subsurface. By deploying and controlling the potential of in situ electrodes 4850 ft below the surface at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (South Dakota, USA), we highlight the promise of electrochemical techniques for studying active terrestrial subsurface microbial communities and enabling the isolation of electrochemically active microbes.",

    "abstract": "Oral cholera vaccines (OCVs) are being increasingly employed, but current killed formulations generally require multiple doses and lack efficacy in young children. We recently developed a new live-attenuated OCV candidate (HaitiV) derived from a Vibrio cholerae strain isolated during the 2010 Haiti cholera epidemic. HaitiV exhibited an unexpected probiotic-like activity in infant rabbits, preventing intestinal colonization and disease by wild-type V. cholerae before the onset of adaptive immunity. However, it remained unknown whether HaitiV would behave similarly to other OCVs to stimulate adaptive immunity against V. cholerae. Here, we orally immunized adult germ-free female mice to test HaitiVs immunogenicity. HaitiV safely and stably colonized vaccinated mice and induced known adaptive immune correlates of cholera protection within 14 days of administration. Pups born to immunized mice were protected against lethal challenges of both homologous and heterologous V. cholerae strains. Cross-fostering experiments revealed that protection was not dependent on vaccine colonization in or transmission to the pups. These findings demonstrate the protective immunogenicity of HaitiV and support its development as a new tool for limiting cholera.\n\nAuthor summaryVaccines for cholera are gaining acceptance as public health tools for prevention of cholera and curtailing the spread of outbreaks. However, current killed vaccines provide minimal protection in young children, who are especially susceptible to this diarrheal disease, and do not stimulate immunity against antigens that may only be expressed by live bacteria during infection. We recently developed HaitiV, an extensively engineered live-attenuated oral cholera vaccine candidate, derived from a clinical isolate from the Haiti cholera outbreak. Here, we found that the HaitiV induces immunological correlates of protection against cholera in germ free mice and leads to protection against disease in their offspring. Protection in this model was dependent on passively acquired factors in the milk of immunized dams and not transmission or colonization of HaitiV. Coupling the immunogenicity data presented here with our previous observation that HaitiV can protect from cholera prior to the induction of adaptive immunity, suggests that HaitiV may provide both rapid-onset short-term protection from disease while eliciting stable and long-lasting immunity against cholera.",

Existing methods to identify the engineering source are insufficient for attribution. We hypothesized that strategies used for DNA design and optimization could act as identifiable fingerprints of design software or particular vendors, making engineered agents more attributable to their source. To test this hypothesis, sequences optimized using various gene synthesis vendors were characterized using a machine learning model. By capturing optimization signatures unique to each vendor, the trained model showed an ability to identify a sequences origin with an accuracy up to 92%, indicating it is possible to distinguish the algorithm utilized to optimize a genetic sequence based on the DNA sequence output alone.",

    "abstract": "Human tuberculosis is caused by members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and presents variable disease outcomes. The variation has primarily been attributed to host and environmental factors, but recent evidence indicates an additional role of genetic diversity among MTBC clinical strains. Here, we used metabolomics to unravel the potential role of genetic variations in conferring strain-specific adaptive capacity and vulnerability. To systematically identify functionality of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we developed a constraint-based approach that integrates metabolomic and genomic data. Model-based predictions were systematically tested against independent metabolome data; they correctly classified SNP effects in pyruvate kinase and suggested a genetic basis for strain-specific sensitivity to the antibiotic para-aminosalicylic acid. Our method is broadly applicable to mutations in enzyme-encoding genes across microbial life, opening new possibilities for identifying strain-specific metabolic vulnerabilities that could lead to more selective treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases may be the cause or the consequence of an acceleration of physiological ageing. Evidence for this concept is lacking due to practical limitations of human studies. Here, we compared the processes of physiological and pathological ageing of individual C. elegans over their lifespan. Using multi-parametric phenotyping, trajectories of ageing can be defined within a phenotypic landscape made of a large set of phenotypical features. Rather than an acceleration of ageing, a model for synucleinopathy showed a divergent trajectory of ageing. The pathological progression in individual animals can be predicted from early phenotypes with high accuracy. Despite of similar lifespans, disease-model worms display an early onset of decline in their phenotypic range of ability. This loss of flexibility provides an index of health valid for physiological and pathological contexts. Finally, we demonstrate the power of multi-parametric dataset to describe ageing, to quantify health and to predict specific health risks.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionSteroid sulfatase (STS) is an enzyme which cleaves sulfate groups from a variety of steroid hormones, thereby altering their activity and solubility. The expression and activity of STS is increased in female mammalian tissues (including brain) during late pregnancy and into the postpartum period. STS-deficient human and mouse mothers (as a consequence of genetic mutation or acute pharmacological manipulation) show evidence for elevated psychopathology and abnormal behaviour respectively in the postpartum period. In mice, these behavioural effects can be partially normalised through administration of the antipsychotic ziprasidone.\n\nMethodsTo explore the neurobiology underlying these postpartum behavioural effects, we compared whole brain gene expression by microarray in behaviourally-defined new mouse mothers acutely administered the STS inhibitor 667-Coumate (10mg/kg p.o.) or vehicle solution (n=12 per group); significant changes were followed-up with pathway analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Finally, the effects of combined 667-Coumate and antipsychotic (ziprasidone) administration (0, 0.3 and 1.0mg/kg i.p.) on the brain expression of the most robustly differentially-expressed candidate genes was examined (n[&ge;]7 per group).\n\nResultsSurprisingly, no significant gene expression changes were detected between vehicle and 667-Coumate-treated brains at a False Discovery Rate (FDR) corrected p<0.1. 1,081 unique expression changes were detected at a less-stringent cut-off of p<0.05, just two top hits were verified by qPCR, and pathway analysis indicated a significant enrichment of genes involved in olfactory transduction (corrected p-value=1.8x10-3). The expression of the two most robust differentially-expressed genes (Stoml3 and Cyp2g1) was not affected by ziprasidone administration.\n\nConclusionsBehavioural abnormalities in new mothers in the postpartum period elicited as a result of STS deficiency are likely to be the culmination of many small gene expression changes. Our data are consistent with the idea that olfactory function is key to postpartum maternal behaviour in mice, and suggest that aberrant expression of olfactory system genes may partially underlie abnormal maternal behaviour in STS-deficient women.",

    "abstract": "The brain makes flexible and adaptive responses in the complicated and ever-changing environment for the organisms survival. To achieve this, the brain needs to choose appropriate actions flexibly in response to sensory inputs. Moreover, the brain also has to understand how its actions affect future sensory inputs and what reward outcomes should be expected, and adapts its behavior based on the actual outcomes. A modeling approach that takes into account of the combined contingencies between sensory inputs, actions, and reward outcomes may be the key to understanding the underlying neural computation. Here, we train a recurrent neural network model based on sequence learning to predict future events based on the past event sequences that combine sensory, action, and reward events. We use four exemplary tasks that have been used in previous animal and human experiments to study different aspects of decision making and learning. We first show that the model reproduces the animals choice and reaction time pattern in a probabilistic reasoning task, and its units activities mimics the classical findings of the ramping pattern of the parietal neurons that reflects the evidence accumulation process during decision making. We further demonstrate that the model carries out Bayesian inference and may support meta-cognition such as confidence with additional tasks. Finally, we show how the network model achieves adaptive behavior with an approach distinct from reinforcement learning. Our work pieces together many experimental findings in decision making and reinforcement learning and provides a unified framework for the flexible and adaptive behavior of the brain.",

    "abstract": "Genetic factors play a significant role in risk for mood and anxiety disorders. Polymorphisms in genes that regulate the brain monoamine systems, such as catabolic enzymes and transporters, are attractive candidates for being risk factors for emotional disorders given the weight of evidence implicating monoamines involvement in these conditions. Several common genetic variants have been identified in the human serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene, including a repetitive sequence located in the promoter region of the locus called the serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTT-LPR). This polymorphism has been associated with a number of mental traits in both humans and primates, including depression, neuroticism, and harm avoidance. Some, but not all studies found a link between the polymorphism and 5-HTT levels, leaving open the question of whether the polymorphism affects risk for mental traits via changes in 5-HTT expression. To investigate the impact of the polymorphism on gene expression, serotonin homeostasis, and behavioural traits we set out to develop a mouse model of the human 5-HTT- LPR. Here we describe the creation and characterization of a set of mouse lines with single copy human transgenes carrying the short and long 5-HTT-LPR variants.",

In Drosophila larvae, we show U motor neurons are a temporal cohort--a set of non-identical, contiguously-born neurons from a single neuronal stem cell that contribute to the same circuit. We prolong expression of a temporal transcription factor, Hunchback, to increase the number of U motor neurons with early-born molecular identities. On the circuit level, this expands and re-wires the U motor neuron temporal cohort. On the cell biological level, we find novel roles for Hunchback in motor neuron target selection, neuromuscular synapse formation, dendrite morphogenesis, and behavior. These data provide insight into the relationship between stem cell and circuit, show that Hunchback is a potent regulator of circuit assembly, and suggest that temporal transcription factors are molecules that could be altered during evolution or biomedical intervention for the generation of novel circuits.",

    "abstract": "Amphisomes are transient organelles that derive from fusion of autophagosomes with late endosomes. They rapidly transform into degradative autolysosomes, whereas non-degradative roles of the autophagic pathway have been barely described. Here we show that in neurons BDNF/TrkB receptor bearing Rab7 / Light chain 3 (LC3) - positive amphisomes signal at presynaptic boutons during retrograde trafficking to the soma. Local signaling and inward transport essentially require the Rap GTPase-activating (RapGAP) protein SIPA1L2, which directly binds to TrkB and Snapin to connect TrkB-containing amphisomes to dynein. Association with LC3 regulates the RapGAP activity of SIPA1L2 and thereby retrograde trafficking. Following induction of presynaptic plasticity amphisomes dissociate from dynein at boutons, and this enables local signaling and promotes transmitter release. Accordingly, sipa1l2 knockout mice show impaired BDNF-dependent presynaptic plasticity. Collectively, the data suggest that TrkB-signaling endosomes are in fact amphisomes that during retrograde transport have local signaling capacity in the context of presynaptic plasticity.",

We found an association between elevated PUFA levels and vulnerability to ferroptosis in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. A screen of PUFAs identified conjugated linolenic acids, including -eleostearate, as ferroptosis inducers. Three conjugated double bonds were required for ferroptotic activity although their positioning and stereochemistry were less significant. Mechanistically, -eleostearate differed from canonical ferroptosis inducers by a distinct dependence on acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain isoforms and by not altering glutathione or glutathione peroxidase 4 activity. Orally administered tung oil, naturally rich in -eleostearate, limited tumor growth and metastasis in an aggressive TNBC xenograft model. These results expand our understanding of ferroptotic cell death and highlight the anti-cancer potential of conjugated PUFAs.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal activity in the brain is regulated by an excitation-inhibition balance. Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) evoked electroencephalographic (EEG) potentials (TEPs) represent a novel way to quantify pharmacological effects on neuronal activity in the human cortex. Here we tested TEPs under the influence of a single oral dose of two anti-glutamatergic drugs, perampanel, an AMPA-receptor antagonist, and dextromethorphan, an NMDA-receptor antagonist, and nimodipine, an L-type voltage-gated calcium channel blocker in 16 healthy adults in a pseudorandomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Single-pulse TMS was delivered to the left motor cortex and TEPs were obtained pre-and post-drug intake. Dextromethorphan specifically increased the amplitude of the N45, a negative potential around 45 ms after the TMS pulse, while perampanel reduced the P70 amplitude in the non-stimulated hemisphere. Nimodipine and placebo had no effect on TEPs. These data extend previous pharmaco-TMS-EEG studies by demonstrating that the N45 is regulated by a balance of GABAAergic inhibition and NMDA-receptor-mediated glutamatergic excitation. In contrast, AMPA-receptor-mediated glutamatergic neurotransmission contributes to interhemispherically propagated activity reflected in the P70. These data are important to understand the physiology of TEPs as markers of excitability and propagated activity in the human cortex in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "The detection and anticipation of threat facilitates innate defensive behaviours including freezing reactions. Freezing in humans is characterized by reductions in body sway and heart rate and limited evidence suggests that individual differences in freezing reactions are associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity and anxiety. However, previous measurements of human freezing reactions were largely based on passive threat contexts where natural variations in adaptive threat coping could not be assessed. In a well powered sample (N=419), we studied individual differences in anticipatory freezing reactions, by measuring body sway and heart rate, during an active shooting task where shooting decisions had to be taken under threat of shock. We linked freezing measures to subsequent actions and predictors of anxiety-related psychopathology, including accumulated long-term (3 months) hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) and trait anxiety. The anticipation of threat of shock elicited significant body sway- and heart rate reductions consistent with freezing. Whereas both freezing-related reductions in body sway and heart rate were associated with faster correct shooting decisions, body sway reductions were additionally related to more impulsive shooting (false alarms). Individual differences in threat-related reductions in body sway but not heart rate were further associated to lower HCC and higher trait anxiety. The observed links between freezing and subsequent defensive actions as well as predictors of stress-related psychopathology suggest the potential value of defensive freezing reactions as somatic marker for stress-vulnerability and resilience.",

    "abstract": "Juxtaglomerular (JG) cells, major sources of renin, differentiate from metanephric mesenchymal cells which give rise to JG cells or a subset of smooth muscle cells of the renal afferent arteriole. During periods of dehydration and salt deprivation JG cells undergo expansion. Gene expression profiling comparing resident renal Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) with JG cells indicate that the transcription factor Sox6 is highly expressed in JG cells in the adult kidney. In vitro, loss of Sox6 expression reduces differentiation of renal MSCs to renin producing cells. In vivo, Sox6 expression is up-regulated during JG cell expansion. Importantly, knockout of Sox6 in Ren1d+ cells halts the increase in renin expressing cells normally seen during JG cell expansion as well as the typical increase in renin. These results support a previously undefined role for Sox6 in renin expression during normal and pathophysiological conditions.",

    "abstract": "Cardiopulmonary testing (CPET) and biomarkers such as NT-proBNP, Galectin-3, and C-reactive protein (CRP) have shown great promise for characterizing the heart failure (HF) phenotypes. However, the underlying metabolic changes that cause, predict and accompany changes in these parameters are not well known. In depth knowledge of these metabolic changes has the ability to provide new insights towards the clinical management of HF as well as providing better biomarkers for the assessment of disease progression and measurement of success from clinical interventions. To address this knowledge gap, we undertook a deep metabolomic and lipidomic phenotyping of a cohort of HF patients and utilized Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) to identify associations between the patients plasma metabolome and the lipidome to parameters of CPET and the above mentioned HF biomarkers (HFBio). A total of 49 subjects were submitted to CPET and HFBio evaluation with deep metabolomic and lipidomic profiling of the plasma. Stepwise MRA and Standard Least Squares methods were used to determine models of best fit. Metabolic Pathway Analysis was utilized to detect what metabolites were over-represented and significantly enriched, and Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis was used to explore pre-existing biological knowledge from studies of human metabolism. The study cohort was predominantly males of African American decent, presenting a high frequency of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension with a low mean left ventricular ejection fraction and a high left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume. VE/VCO2 and Peak VO2 (CV=0.07 and 0.08, respectively) showed the best metabolic predictive model for test performance, while CRP and NT-ProBNP (CV=0.31 and 0.29, respectively) were the least fitted models. Aminoacyl-tRNA and amino acid biosynthesis, amino acid metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, sphingolipid and glycerolipid metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, glutathione metabolism, and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) were revealed to be the most relevant pathways. Principal related diseases were brain dysfunction and enzyme deficiencies associated with lactic acidosis. Considering the modulations in HF poor test performance, our results indicate an overall profile of oxidative stress, lactic acidosis, and metabolic syndrome coupled with mitochondria dysfunction. Overall, the insights resulting from this studys MRA coincides with what has previously been discussed in parts in existing literature thereby confirming the validity of our findings while at the same time thoroughly characterizing the metabolic underpinning of CPET and HFBio results.",

    "abstract": "An enigmatic step in de novo formation of the autophagosome membrane compartment is the expansion of the precursor membrane phagophore, which requires the acquisition of lipids to serve as building blocks. Autophagy-related 2 (ATG2), the rod-shaped protein that tethers phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P)-enriched phagophores to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is suggested to be essential for phagophore expansion, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that human ATG2A is a lipid-transferring protein. ATG2A can extract lipids from membrane vesicles and unload them to other vesicles. Lipid transfer by ATG2A is more efficient between its tethered vesicles than between untethered vesicles. The PI3P effectors WIPI4 and WIPI1 associate ATG2A stably to PI3P-containing vesicles, thereby facilitating ATG2A-mediated tethering and lipid transfer between PI3P-containing vesicles and PI3P-free vesicles. Based on these results, we propose that ATG2-mediated transfer of lipids from the ER to the phagophore enables phagophore expansion.",

    "abstract": "Dysfunctions of the mitochondrial energy-generating machinery cause a series of progressive, untreatable and usually fatal diseases collectively known as mitochondrial disease. High energy-requiring organs such as the brain are especially affected, leading to developmental delay, ataxia, respiratory failure, hypotonia, seizures and premature death. While neural affectation is a critical component of the pathology, only discrete neuronal populations are susceptible. However, their molecular identity and their contribution to the disease remain unknown. Mice lacking the mitochondrial Complex I subunit NDUFS4 (Ndufs4KO mice) recapitulate the classical signs of Leigh Syndrome (LS), the most common presentation of mitochondrial disease with predominant CNS affectation. Here, we identify the critical role of two genetically-defined neuronal populations driving the fatal phenotype in Ndufs4KO mice. Selective inactivation of Ndufs4 in Vglut2-expressing glutamatergic neurons causes brainstem inflammation, motor and respiratory deficits, and early death. On the other hand, Ndufs4 deletion in GABAergic neurons leads to basal ganglia inflammation without motor or respiratory involvement, but accompanied by severe refractory epileptic seizures preceding premature death. These results provide novel insight in the cell type-specific contribution to LS pathology and open new avenues to understand the underlying cellular mechanisms of mitochondrial disease.",

However, the specific mechanisms through which they confer risk remain unclear.\n\nMethodsUsing a functional genomics approach, we integrated transcriptomic data from the developing human brain, genome-wide association findings for SCZ and ASD, protein interaction data, and pathophysiological signatures of SCZ and ASD to: 1) organize genes into the developmental cellular and molecular systems within which they operate; 2) identify neurodevelopmental processes associated with polygenic risk for SCZ and ASD across the allelic frequency spectrum; and 3) elucidate pathways and individual genes through which 22q11.2 CNVs may confer risk for each disorder.\n\nResultsPolygenic risk for SCZ and ASD converged on partially overlapping gene networks involved in synaptic function and transcriptional regulation, with ASD risk variants additionally enriched for networks involved in neuronal differentiation during fetal development. The 22q11.2 locus formed a large protein network that disproportionately affected SCZ- and ASD-associated neurodevelopmental networks, including loading highly onto synaptic and gene regulatory pathways. SEPT5, PI4KA, and SNAP29 genes are candidate drivers of 22q11.2 synaptic pathology relevant to SCZ and ASD, and DGCR8 and HIRA are candidate drivers of disease-relevant alterations in gene regulation.\n\nConclusionsThe current approach provides a powerful framework to identify neurodevelopmental processes affected by diverse risk variants for SCZ and ASD, and elucidate the mechanisms through which highly penetrant multi-gene CNVs contribute to disease risk.",

    "abstract": "RNA plays essential regulatory roles in all known forms of life. Clustering RNA sequences with common sequence and structure is an essential step towards studying RNA function. With the advent of high-throughput sequencing techniques, experimental and genomic data are expanding to complement the predictive methods. However, the existing methods do not effectively utilize and cope with the immense amount of data becoming available.\n\nHere we present GraphClust2, a comprehensive approach for scalable clustering of RNAs based on sequence and structural similarities. GraphClust2 provides an integrative solution by incorporating diverse types of experimental and genomic data in an accessible fashion via the Galaxy framework. We demonstrate that the tasks of clustering and annotation of structured RNAs can be considerably improved, through a scalable methodology that also supports structure probing data. Based on this, we further introduce an off-the-shelf procedure to identify locally conserved structure candidates in long RNAs. In this way, we suggest the presence and the sparsity of phylogenetically conserved local structures in some long non-coding RNAs. Furthermore, we demonstrate the advantage of a scalable clustering for discovering structured motifs under inherent and experimental biases and uncover prominent targets of the double-stranded RNA binding protein Roquin-1 that are evolutionary conserved.",

    "abstract": "Animals such as bumble bees use chemosensory cues to localize and evaluate essential resources. Increasingly, it is recognized that microbes can alter the quality of foraged resources and produce metabolites that act as foraging cues. The distinct nature of these sensory cues however and their use in animal foraging remain poorly understood. Here, we test the hypothesis that species of nectar-inhabiting microbes differentially influence pollinator attraction and feeding via microbial metabolites in nectar. We examined electrophysiological potential of bumble bee antennae to respond to volatile microbial metabolites, followed by behavioral responses using choice assays. We assessed gustatory responses through both no-choice and choice feeding assays. Antennae responded to some microbial volatiles, and bees chose Asaia bacterial solutions compared to Metschnikowia yeast based on volatiles alone. However, B. impatiens consumed significantly more Metschnikowia-inoculated nectar, suggesting distinct roles for volatile and non-volatile microbial metabolites in mediating feeding decisions, with potential to affect associative learning and future foraging. Our results suggest that microbial metabolites may represent non-reinforcing cues with potential consequences for forager learning, economics and floral host reproduction.",

    "abstract": "Gene tree - species tree reconciliation methods have been employed for studying ancient whole genome duplication (WGD) events across the eukaryotic tree of life. Most approaches have relied on using maximum likelihood trees and the maximum parsimony reconciliation thereof to count duplication events on specific branches of interest in a reference species tree. Such approaches do not account for uncertainty in the gene tree and reconciliation, or do so only heuristically. The effects of these simplifications on the inference of ancient WGDs are unclear. In particular the effects of variation in gene duplication and loss rates across the species tree have not been considered. Here, we developed a full probabilistic approach for phylogenomic reconciliation based WGD inference, accounting for both gene tree and reconciliation uncertainty using a method based on the principle of amalgamated likelihood estimation. The model and methods are implemented in a maximum likelihood and Bayesian setting and account for variation of duplication and loss rate across the species tree, using methods inspired by phylogenetic divergence time estimation. We applied our newly developed framework to ancient WGDs in land plants and investigate the effects of duplication and loss rate variation on reconciliation and gene count based assessment of these earlier proposed WGDs.",

Medical practice has traditionally focused on highly penetrant variants with large effect sizes and, consequently, classification and clinical reporting frameworks are tailored to that variant type. At the other end of the penetrance spectrum, where variants are often referred to as \"risk alleles\", traditional frameworks are no longer appropriate. This has led to inconsistency in how such variants are interpreted and classified. Here, we describe a conceptual framework to begin addressing this gap.\n\nMethodsWe used a set of risk alleles to define data elements that can characterize the validity of reported disease associations. We assigned weight to these data elements and established classification categories expressing confidence levels. This framework was then expanded to develop criteria for inclusion of risk alleles on clinical reports.\n\nResultsFoundational data elements include cohort size, quality of phenotyping, statistical significance, and replication of results. Criteria for determining inclusion of risk alleles on clinical reports include presence of clinical management guidelines, effect size, severity of the associated phenotype, and effectiveness of intervention.\n\nConclusionsThis framework represents an approach for classifying risk alleles and can serve as a foundation to catalyze community efforts for refinement.",
