    "abstract": "Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are a recently discovered class of monocopper enzymes, broadly distributed across the Tree of Life. We recently reported that LPMOs can use H2O2 as an oxidant, revealing a novel reaction pathway. Here, we aimed to elucidate the H2O2-mediated reaction mechanism with experimental and computational approaches. In silico studies suggest that a network of hydrogen bonds, involving both the enzyme and the substrate, brings H2O2 into a strained reactive conformation, and guides the derived hydroxyl radical towards formation of a copper-oxyl intermediate. The initial H2O2 homolytic cleavage and subsequent hydrogen atom abstraction from chitin by the copper-oxyl intermediate are suggested to be the main energy barriers. Under single turnover conditions, stopped-flow fluorimetry demonstrates that LPMO-Cu(II) reduction to Cu(I) is a fast process compared to the re-oxidation reactions. We found that re-oxidation of LPMO-Cu(I) is 2000-fold faster with H2O2 than with O2, the latter being several orders of magnitude slower than rates reported for other monooxygenases. In agreement with the notion of ternary complex formation, when chitin is added, re-oxidation by H2O2 is accelerated whereas that by O2 slows. Simulations indicated that Glu60, a highly-conserved residue, gates the access to the confined active site and constrains H2O2 during catalysis, and Glu60 mutations significantly decreased the enzyme performance. By providing molecular and kinetic insights into the peroxygenase activity of chitinolytic LPMOs, this study will aid the development of applications of enzymatic and synthetic copper catalysis and contribute to understanding pathogenesis, notably chitinolytic plant defenses against fungi and insects.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=108 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/541292v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (28K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@92826org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12b0a19org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a3fa2aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17cfa80_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Specialized associations between interacting species are a fundamental determinant of the diversity and distribution of both partners. How specialization of guilds of organisms varies along environmental gradients underpins popular theories of biogeography and macroecology, whereas the degree of specialization of a species is typically considered fixed. However, the extent to which environmental context impacts specialization dynamics is seldom examined empirically. In this study, we examine how specialization within a bipartite network consisting of three co-occurring plant species and their foliar fungal endophyte symbionts changes along a 1 000-meter elevation gradient where host species were held constant. The gradient, along the slope of Mauna Loa shield volcano, represents the entire elevational range of two of the three plants. Network and plant specialization values displayed a parabolic relationship with elevation, and were highest at middle elevations, whereas bipartite associations were least specific at low and high elevations. Shannons diversity of fungal endophytes negatively correlated with specificity, and was highest at the ends of the transects. Although plant host was a strong determinant of fungal community composition within sites, fungal species turnover was high among sites and plant host predicted a weak, though significant proportion of compositional variance. There was no evidence of spatial or elevational patterning in fungal community compositon. Our work demonstrates that specificity can be a plastic trait which is influenced by the environment and centrality of the host within its natural range.",

Since members of a given microbial community can be simultaneously involved in multiple relations that altogether will determine their abundance, not all significant relations between organisms are expected to be manifested as visually uninterrupted patterns and be detected using traditional correlation nor mutual information coefficient based approaches.\n\nResultsThis manuscript proposes a pattern specific way to quantify the strength and estimate the statistical significance of two-dimensional co-presence, co-exclusion, and one-way relations patterns between abundance profiles of two organisms which can be extended to three or more dimensional patterns. Presented approach can also be extended by including a variety of physical (pH, temperature, oxygen concentration) and biochemical (antimicrobial susceptibility, nutrient and metabolite concentration) variables into the search for multidimensional patterns. The presented approach has been tested using 2,380 microbiome samples from the Human Microbiome Project resulting in body-site specific networks of statistically significant 2D patterns. We also were able to demonstrate the presence of several 3D patterns in the Human Microbiome Project data.\n\nAvailabilityC++ source code for two and three-dimensional patterns, as well as executable files for the Pickle pipeline, are in the attached supplementary materials.\n\nContactgegolovk@utmb.edu",

    "abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy could cause a set of severe abnormalities in the fetus known as congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). Experiments using animal models and in vitro systems significantly contributed to our understanding of the physiopathology of ZIKV infection. However, the molecular basis of CZS is not yet studied in humans. Here, we used a systems biology approach to integrate transcriptomic, proteomic and genomic data from post-mortem brains of neonates with CZS. We observed that collagen genes were greatly reduced in CZS brains at both the RNA and protein levels and that neonates with CZS have several polymorphisms in collagen genes associated with osteogenesis imperfect and arthrogryposis. These findings were validated using immunohistochemistry and collagen staining of ZIKV infected and non-infected samples. Additionally, it was found that cell adhesion genes that are essential for neurite outgrowth and axon guidance were up-regulated and thereby confirmed the neuronal migration defects observed. This work provided new insights into the underlying mechanisms of CZS and revealed host genes associated with CZS susceptibility.",

Here we describe a novel approach Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscapes (MIEL) that captures patterns of nuclear staining of epigenetic marks (e.g. acetylated and methylated histones) and employs machine learning to accurately distinguish between such patterns (1). We demonstrated that MIEL has superior resolution compared to conventional intensity thresholding techniques and enables efficient detection of epigenetically active compounds, function-based classification, flagging possible off-target effects and even predict novel drug function.

    "abstract": "SummaryIn healthy adult organs, robust feedback mechanisms control cell turnover to enforce homeostatic equilibrium between cell division and death [1, 2]. Nascent tumors must subvert these mechanisms to achieve cancerous overgrowth [3-7]. Elucidating the nature of this subversion can reveal how cancers become established and may suggest strategies to prevent tumor progression. In adult Drosophila intestine, a well-studied model of homeostatic cell turnover, the linchpin of cell equilibrium is feedback control of the EGF protease Rhomboid (Rho). Expression of Rho in apoptotic cells enables them to secrete EGFs, which stimulate nearby stem cells to undergo replacement divisions [8]. As in mammals, loss of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) causes Drosophila intestinal stem cells to form adenomas [9]. Here we demonstrate that Drosophila APC-/- tumors trigger widespread Rho expression in non-apoptotic cells, resulting in chronic EGF signaling. Initially, nascent APC-/- tumors induce rho in neighbor wild-type cells via acute, non-autonomous activation of JNK. During later growth and multilayering, APC-/- tumors induce rho in tumor cells by autonomous downregulation of E-cadherin (E-cad) and consequent activity of p120-catenin. This sequential dysregulation of tumor non-autonomous and -autonomous EGF signaling converts tissue-level feedback into feed-forward activation that drives cancerous overgrowth. Since Rho, EGFR, and E-cad are associated with colorectal cancer in humans [10-17], our findings may shed light on how human colorectal tumors progress.",

Indirect comparison of some prior investigations suggested differential impact of inhaled THC between Wistar (WI) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, thus this study was conducted to directly compare the strains.\n\nGroups (N=8 per strain) of age matched male SD and WI rats were prepared with radiotelemetry devices to measure temperature and then exposed to vapor from the propylene glycol (PG) vehicle or THC (25, 100, 200 mg/mL of PG) for 30 or 40 minutes. Additional studies evaluated plasma THC levels and anti-nociceptive effects after THC inhalation as well as the thermoregulatory effect of intraperitoneal injection of THC (5-30 mg/kg).\n\nHypothermic effects of inhaled THC was more pronounced in SD rats however plasma levels of THC were identical across strains under either fixed inhalation conditions or injection of a mg/kg equivalent dose. Strain differences in hypothermia were even more pronounced after i.p. injection of THC with SD rats exhibiting dose-dependent temperature reduction after 5 or 10 mg/kg, i.p. and the WI rats only exhibiting significant hypothermia after 20 mg/kg, i.p. The anti-nociceptive effects of inhaled THC (100, 200 mg/mL) did not differ significantly across the strains. These studies confirm an insensitivity of WI rats, compared with SD rats, to the hypothermia induced by THC following inhalation conditions that produced identical plasma THC and anti-nociception. Thus strain differences were not due to differential THC delivery via vapor inhalation.",

    "abstract": "Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) are ubiquitous aquatic microorganisms that biomineralize dissolved iron from the environment into intracellular nanoparticles of magnetite [Fe(II)Fe(III)2O4] or greigite [Fe(II)Fe(III)2S4] in a genetically controlled manner. After cell death, these magnetite and greigite crystals are trapped into sediments which effectively removes iron from the soluble pool. MTB may significantly impact the iron biogeochemical cycle, especially in the ocean where dissolved iron limits nitrogen fixation and primary productivity. Although MTB are ubiquitous in the environment, their impact on the biogeochemical cycling of metallic elements is still poorly constrained. A thorough assessment of the mass of iron incorporated by MTB has been hampered by a lack of methodology to accurately measure the amount of, and variability in, their intracellular iron content. Here, we quantify the mass of iron contained in single MTB cells of the model organism, Magnetospirillum magneticum sp. AMB-1, using a time-resolved mass spectrometry methodology. Bacterial iron content depends on the external iron concentration, and reaches a maximum value of 10-6 ng of iron per cell when bacteria are cultivated with initial iron concentrations of 100 M or higher. From our experimental results, we calculated the flux of dissolved iron incorporation into natural MTB populations and conclude that MTB may mineralize a significant fraction of environmental dissolved iron into crystals.",

    "abstract": "The eponymous vocalizations of howling monkeys (genus Alouatta) are associated with territorial defense and male-male competition, yet the extreme loudness of howls, which are among the loudest vocalizations of any terrestrial mammal, have yet to be fully explained. Loudness facilitates long-distance sound propagation but the effectiveness of any vocal signal depends in part on the auditory capabilities of the intended receiver, and the auditory sensitivities of howling monkeys are unknown. To better understand the evolution of loud calls, we used the auditory brainstem response (ABR) method to estimate the auditory sensitivities of Alouatta palliata. The mean estimated audiogram of four wild-caught adults displayed a w-shaped pattern with two regions of enhanced sensitivity centered at 0.7-1.0 and 11.3 kHz. The lower-frequency region of auditory sensitivity is pitched moderately higher than the fundamental frequencies of howling, whereas the higher-frequency region corresponds well with harmonics in an infant distress call, the wrah-ha. Fitness advantages from detecting infants amid low-frequency background noise, including howling, could explain the incongruity between our ABR thresholds and the fundamental frequencies of howling. Attending to infant calls is expected to enhance reproductive success within an infanticidal genus, and we suggest that the extraordinary loudness of male howling is an indirect (runaway) result of positive feedback between the selective pressures of hearing infant distress calls and deterring infanticide.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria of the Prochlorococcus and marine Synechococcus genera are the most abundant photosynthetic microbes in the ocean. Intriguingly, the genomes of these bacteria are very divergent even within each genus, both in gene content and at amino acid level of the encoded proteins. One striking exception to this is a 62 amino acid protein, termed Prochlorococcus/Synechococcus Hyper Conserved Protein (PSHCP). PSHCP is not only found in all sequenced Prochlorococcus and marine Synechococcus genomes but it is also nearly 100% identical in its amino acid sequence across all sampled genomes. Such universal distribution and sequence conservation suggests an essential cellular role of the encoded protein in these bacteria. However, the function of PSHCP is unknown. We used Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine its structure. We found that 52 of the 62 amino acids in PSHCP form a Tudor domain, while the remainder of the protein is disordered. NMR titration experiments revealed that PSHCP has only a weak affinity for DNA, but an 18.5 fold higher affinity for tRNA, hinting at an involvement of PSHCP in translation. Computational docking and mutagenesis studies identified a positively charged patch surrounding residue K30 that serves as the primary docking site for tRNA on PSHCP. These results provide the first insight into the structure and function of PSHCP and suggest a new function for Tudor domains in recognizing tRNA.",

    "abstract": "The visualization of the molecular context of an amino acid mutation in a protein structure is crucial for the assessment of its functional impact and to understand its evolutionary implications. Currently, searches for fast evolving amino acid positions using codon substitution models like those implemented in PAML [1] are done in almost complete proteomes, generating large numbers of candidate proteins that require individual structural analyses. Here we present two python wrapper scripts as the package Link Your Sites (LYS). The first one i) mines the RCSB database [10] using the blast alignment tool to find the best matching homologous sequences, ii) fetches their domain positions by using Prosites [3,8,9], iii) parses the output of PAML extracting the positional information of fast-evolving sites and transform them into the coordinate system of the protein structure, iv) outputs a file per gene with the positions correlations to its homologous sequence. The second script uses the output of the first one to generate the proteins graphical assessment. LYS can therefore generate figures to be used in publication highlighting the positively selected sites mapped on regions that are known to have functional relevance and/or be used to reduce the number of targets that will be further analyzed by providing a list of those for which structural information can be retrieved.\n\nMotivationAutomatizing the search for protein structures to assess the functional impact of sites found to be under positive selection by codeml, implemented in PAML [1]. Building publication-quality figures highlighting the sites on a protein structure model that are within and outside functional domains. reduces the workload associated with selecting proteins for which a functional assessment of the impact of mutations can be done using a protein structure. This is especially relevant when analyzing almost complete proteomes which is the case of large comparative genomic studies.\n\nSoftwareLYS scripts are executed in the command line. They automatically search for homologous proteins at the RSCB database [10], determine the functional domain locations and correlate the positions pointed by the M8 model [1], and output a data frame that can be used as the input by PyMOL [7] to generate a visualization of the results.\n\nAvailabilityLYS is easy to install and implement and they are available at https://github.com/LysSanzMoreta/LYSAutomaticSearch",

While more and more SVs are being identified, a number of them are difficult to visualize using existing SV visualization tools. Therefore, methods to visualize SVs such as nested or large SVs of over a megabase pair need to be developed. To this end, we developed MOdular Multi-scale Integrated Genome graph browser, MoMI-G, a web-based genome browser to visualize SVs, genes, repeats, and other annotations as a variation graph with paths. This browser allows more intuitive recognition of large, nested, and potentially more complex SVs. MoMI-G has view modules for different scales, which allow users to view the whole genome down to nucleotide-level alignments of long reads. Alignments spanning reference alleles and those spanning alternative alleles are shown in the same view. Users can customize the view, if they are not satisfied with the preset views. In addition, MoMI-G has Interval Card Deck, a feature for rapid manual inspection of hundreds of SVs.

    "abstract": "Drought is increasingly considered as the most important selection pressure for forest trees in the context of climate change. We studied adaptation to drought in marginal populations of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) from the French Mediterranean Alps. Drought tolerance was assessed using proxies both from seedlings and adult trees. We measured water stress response, growth and bud break of seedlings originating from 16 populations in a greenhouse common garden experiment (N=8199) and water use efficiency via{delta} 13C of adult trees of the source populations in-situ (N=315). Further, 357 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used to uncover the demographic history of the populations. Demographic distances between populations were used to generate a null expectation for trait divergence, thereby detect the signature of natural selection. We found evidence for adaptive population divergence in drought tolerance across life stages. Seedlings originating from source populations with low soil water capacity resisted better to water stress in the greenhouse, and additionally, adult trees from these populations had a higher water use efficiency. Seedling growth showed an evolutionary trade-off with drought tolerance: seedlings with fast growth and high stature came from populations that had lower drought tolerance. In contrast, population divergence in bud break showed only a weak signal of adaptation, which was independent of that in drought tolerance. Variation in phenology between populations was associated with variance in temperature and drought frequency and severity at the source populations. Our results highlight the adaptive value of marginal populations, advance our understanding of the different processes that have allowed silver fir to cope with drought stress under a warming climate, and contribute to our knowledge to advise assisted migration programs.",

    "abstract": "Insects have been challenged by plant secondary metabolites throughout their evolutionary history. An important mechanism thought to promote insecticide resistance is the ability of insects to use preexisting detoxification systems originally evolved for tolerance of plant defenses. However, it remains unclear what level of convergence exists in metabolic mechanisms employed against various natural and xenobiotic chemicals? How do transcriptomic responses to these stressors change in response to novel and long-term exposure? We employ an experimental evolution approach in a milkweed- specialist aphid (Aphis nerii) model to test the effects of a more toxic host plant species and two insecticides commonly used in rotation in agriculture (a neonicotinoid, Imidacloprid, and a general homopteran blocker, Pymetrozine) on aphid gene expression and fitness over multiple generations of selection. Aphids were selected on three stress treatments: a toxic host plant species and two pesticides (Imidacloprid and Pymetrozine) for five generations. Whole transcriptome gene expression changes and changes in development time and fecundity were compared at generations one and five. While there were no consistent fitness costs or benefits to long-term exposure, exposure to stress is associated with increased transcriptional plasticity and changes in genes associated with the metabolism of secondary metabolites as well as genes important in transcription, translation, and post-translation processes.",

    "abstract": "Nucleic acid-based antiviral innate immunity activates a signaling cascade that induces type I and type III interferons (IFNs), and other cytokines. This signaling, which is highly regulated, is initiated by pattern recognition receptors, such as RIG-I, that sense viral RNA and then signal to the adaptor protein, MAVS. This adaptor protein then recruits additional signaling proteins, including TRAF3 and TBK1, to form a signaling complex that results in IRF3 activation for transcriptional induction of IFN. Here, we show that the GTPase trafficking protein RAB1B positively regulates RIG-I signaling to promote IFN-{beta} induction and the antiviral response. Over-expression of RAB1B increases RIG-I-mediated signaling to IFN-{beta}, while deletion results in reduced signaling of this pathway. Additionally, this loss of RAB1B results in a dampened antiviral response, as Zika virus infection is enhanced in the absence of RAB1B. Importantly, we identified the mechanism of RAB1B action by determining that it interacts with TRAF3 to facilitate the interaction of TRAF3 with MAVS. Thus, we identified RAB1B as a regulator of TRAF3 to promote the formation of innate immune signaling complexes in response to nucleic acid sensing.",

    "abstract": "The degree to which diet reproducibly alters the human and mouse gut microbiota remains unclear. Here, we focus on the consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD), one of the most frequently studied dietary interventions in mice. We employed a subject-level meta-analysis framework for unbiased collection and analysis of publicly available 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic sequencing data from studies examining HFD in rodent models. In total, we re-analyzed 27 studies, 1101 samples, and 106 million reads mapping to 16S rRNA gene sequences. We report reproducible changes in gut microbial community structure both within and between studies, including a significant increase in the Firmicutes phylum and decrease in the Bacteroidetes phylum; however, reduced alpha diversity is not a consistent feature of HFD. Finer taxonomic analysis revealed that the strongest signal of HFD on microbiota species composition is Lactococcus spp., which we demonstrate is a common dietary contaminant through the molecular testing of dietary ingredients, culturing, microscopy, and germ-free mouse experiments. After in silico removal of Lactococcus spp., we employed machine learning to define a unique operational taxonomic unit (OTU)-based signature capable of predicting the dietary intake of mice and demonstrate that phylogenetic and gene-family transformations of this model are capable of accurately predicting human samples in controlled feeding settings (area under the receiver operator curve = 0.75 and 0.88 respectively). Together, these results demonstrate the utility of microbiome meta-analyses in identifying robust bacterial signals for mechanistic studies and creates a framework for the routine meta-analysis of microbiome studies in preclinical models.",

The computational methods have not kept up with the deluge of data and need for real-time results.\n\nWe have therefore created a bioinformatics pipeline for rapid subtyping and continuous phylogenomic analysis of bacterial samples, suited for large-scale surveillance. To decrease the computational burden, a two level clustering strategy is employed. The data is first divided into sets by matching each isolate to a closely related reference genome. The reads then are aligned to the reference to gain a consensus sequence and SNP based genetic distance is calculated between the sequences in each set. Isolates are clustered together with a threshold of 10 SNPs. Finally, phylogenetic trees are inferred from the non-redundant sequences and the clustered isolates are placed on a clade with the cluster representative sequence. The method was benchmarked and found to be accurate in grouping outbreak strains together, while discriminating from non-outbreak strains.\n\nThe pipeline was applied in Evergreen Online, which processes publicly available sequencing data from foodborne bacterial pathogens on a daily basis, updating the phylogenetic trees as needed. It has so far placed more than 100,000 isolates into phylogenies, and has been able to keep up with the daily release of data.

    "abstract": "MotivationVariant discovery is crucial in medical and clinical research, especially in the setting of personalized medicine. As such, precision in variant identification is paramount. However, variants identified by current genomic analysis pipelines contain many false positives (i.e., incorrectly called variants). These can be potentially eliminated by applying state-of-the-art filtering tools, such as the Variant Quality Score Recalibration (VQSR) or the Hard Filtering (HF), both proposed by GATK. However, these methods are very user-dependent and fail to run in some cases. We propose VEF, a variant filtering tool based on ensemble methods that overcomes the main drawbacks of VQSR and the HF. Contrary to these methods, we treat filtering as a supervised learning problem. This is possible by using for training variant call data for which the set of \"true\" variants is known, i.e., a gold standard exists. Hence, we can classify each variant in the training VCF file as true or false using the gold standard, and further use the annotations of each variant as features for the classification problem. Once trained, VEF can be directly applied to filter the variants contained in a given VCF file. Analysis of several ensemble methods revealed random forest as offering the best performance, and hence VEF uses a random forest for the classification task.\n\nResultsAfter training VEF on a Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) Human dataset of sample NA12878, we tested its performance on a WGS Human dataset of sample NA24385. For these two samples, the set of high-confident variants has been produced and made available. Results show that the proposed filtering tool VEF consistently outperforms VQSR and HF. In addition, we show that VEF generalizes well even when some features have missing values, and when the training and testing datasets differ either in coverage or in the sequencing machine that was used to generate the data. Finally, since the training needs to be performed only once, there is a significant saving in running time when compared to VQSR (50 minutes versus 4 minutes approximately for filtering the SNPs of WGS Human sample NA24385).

    "abstract": "The killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) proteins evolve to fight viruses and mediate the bodys reaction to pregnancy. These roles provide selection pressure for variation at both the structural/haplotype and base/allele levels. At the same time, the genes have evolved relatively recently by tandem duplication and therefore exhibit very high sequence similarity over thousands of bases. These variation-homology patterns make it impossible to interpret KIR haplotypes from abundant short-read genome sequencing data at population scale using existing methods. Here, we developed an efficient computational approach for in silico KIR probe interpretation (KPI) to accurately interpret individuals KIR genes and haplotype-pairs from KIR sequencing reads. We designed synthetic 25-base sequence probes by analyzing previously reported haplotype sequences, and we developed a bioinformatics pipeline to interpret the probes in the context of 16 KIR genes and 16 haplotype structures. We demonstrated its accuracy on a synthetic data set as well as a real whole genome sequences from 748 individuals from The Genome of the Netherlands (GoNL). The GoNL predictions were compared with predictions from SNP-based predictions. Our results show 100% accuracy rate for the synthetic tests and a 99.6% family-consistency rate in the GoNL tests. Agreement with the SNP-based calls on KIR genes ranges from 72-100% with a mean of 92%; most differences occur in genes KIR2DS2, KIR2DL2, KIR2DS3, and KIR2DL5 where KPI predicts presence and the SNP-based interpretation predicts absence. Overall, the evidence suggests that KPIs accuracy is 97% or greater for both KIR gene and haplotype-pair predictions, although the presence/absence genotyping leads to ambiguous haplotype-pair predictions with 16 reference KIR haplotype structures. KPI is free, open, and easily executable as a Nextflow workflow supported by a Docker environment at https://github.com/droeatumn/kpi.",

    "abstract": "The West Indian avifauna has provided fundamental insights into island biogeography, taxon cycles, and the evolution of avian behavior. Our interpretations, however, rely on robust hypotheses of evolutionary relationships and consistent conclusions about taxonomic status in groups with many endemic island populations. Here we present a phylogenetic study of the West Indian thrashers, tremblers, and allies, an assemblage of at least 5 species found on 29 islands, which is considered the archipelagos only avian radiation. We improve on previous phylogenetic studies of this group by using double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD-seq) to broadly sample loci scattered across the nuclear genome. A variety of analyses, based on either nucleotide variation in 2,223 loci that were recovered in all samples or on 13,282 loci that were confidently scored as present or absent in all samples, converged on a single well-supported phylogenetic hypothesis. In contrast to previous studies, we found that the resident West Indian taxa form a monophyletic group, exclusive of the Neotropical-Nearctic migratory Gray Catbird Dumetella carolinensis, which breeds in North America. Earlier studies indicated that the Gray Catbird was nested within a clade of island resident species. Instead, our findings imply a single colonization of the West Indies without the need to invoke a subsequent  reverse colonization of the mainland by West Indian taxa. Furthermore, our study is the first to sample both endemic subspecies of the endangered White-breasted Thrasher Ramphocinclus brachyurus. We find that these subspecies have a long history of evolutionary independence with no evidence of gene flow, and are as genetically divergent from each other as other genera in the group. These findings support recognition of R. brachyurus (restricted to Martinique) and the Saint Lucia Thrasher R. sanctaeluciae as two distinct, single-island endemic species, and indicate the need to re-evaluate conservation plans for these taxa. Our results demonstrate the utility of phylogenomic datasets for generating robust systematic hypotheses.",

    "abstract": "Some viral infections culminate in very different outcomes in different individuals. They can be rapidly cleared in some, cause persistent infection in others, and mortality from immunopathology in yet others. The conventional view is that the different outcomes arise as a consequence of the complex interactions between a large number of different factors (virus, different immune cells and cytokines). Here, we identify a simple dynamical motif comprising the essential interactions between antigens and CD8 T cells and posit it as predominantly determining the outcomes. Antigen can activate CD8 T cells, which in turn can kill infected cells. Sustained antigen stimulation, however, can cause CD8 T cell exhaustion, compromising effector function. Using mathematical modelling, we show that the motif comprising these interactions recapitulates all the outcomes observed. The motif presents a new conceptual framework to understand the variable outcomes of infection. It also explains a number of confounding experimental observations, including the variation in outcomes with the viral inoculum size, the evolutionary advantage of exhaustion in preventing lethal pathology, the ability of NK cells to act as rheostats tuning outcomes, and the role of the innate immune response in the spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C. Interventions that modulate the interactions in the motif may present novel routes to clear persistent infections or limit immunopathology.",

    "abstract": "A major barrier to finding a cure for human immunodeficiency virus type-I (HIV-1) infection is the existence and persistence of the HIV-1 latent reservoir. Although the size of the reservoir is shown to be extremely stable under effective antiretroviral therapy, multiple lines of evidence suggest that the reservoir is composed of dynamic and heterogeneous subpopulations. Quantifying the dynamics of these subpopulations and the processes that maintain the latent reservoir is crucial to the development of effective strategies to eliminate this reservoir. Here, we constructed a mathematical model to consider four latently infected subpopulations, according to their ability to proliferate and the type of virus they are infected. Our model explains a wide range of clinical observations, including variable estimates of the reservoir half-life and dynamical turnover of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) escape viruses in the reservoir. It suggests that very early treatment leads to a reservoir that is small in size and is composed of less stable latently infected cells (compared to the reservoir in chronically infected individuals). The shorter half-lives estimated from individuals treated during acute infection is likely driven by cells that are less prone to proliferate; in contrast, the remarkably consistent estimate of the long half-lives in individuals who are treated during chronic infection are driven by fast proliferating cells that are likely to be infected by CTL escape mutants. Our model shed light on the dynamics of the reservoir in the absence and presence of antiretroviral therapy. More broadly, it can be used to estimate the turnover rates of subpopulations of the reservoir as well as to design and evaluate the impact of various therapeutic interventions to purge the HIV-1 reservoir.\n\nAuthor summaryHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects tens of millions of people globally and causes approximately a million death each year. Current treatment for HIV infection suppresses viral load but does not eradicates the virus. A major barrier to cure HIV infection is the existence and persistence of populations of cells that are latently infected by HIV, i.e. the HIV latent reservoir. Understanding and quantifying the kinetics of the reservoir is therefore critical for developing and evaluating effective therapies to purge the reservoir. Recent studies suggested that this reservoir is heterogenous in their population dynamics; yet most previous mathematical models consider this reservoir as a homogenous population. Here we developed a model explicitly tracking the heterogenous subpopulations of the reservoir. We show that this model explains a wide range of clinical observations, and then demonstrate its utility to make quantitative predictions about varies interventions that aim to restrict or reduce the size of the reservoir.",

    "abstract": "Given ongoing pollinator declines, it is important to understand the dynamics of linked extinctions of plants driven by pollinator extinctions. Topological robustness models focused on this question suggest relatively high robustness of plant species to pollinator species extinctions. Still, existing robustness models typically assume that all interactions in plant-pollinator networks are positive, which is clearly not always the case. For example, many pollinators remove floral resources with-out transferring pollen, or even damage floral structures in the case of nectar robbing. Here we introduce antagonistic interactions into plant-pollinator networks and assess the resilience of plant communities to pollinator species losses. Incorporating antagonistic interactions leads to lower network robustness, i.e. an increased rate of plant species loss (as compared to networks with only mutualistic interactions) in empirical plant-pollinator networks. In conjunction with extinction order, the addition of increasingly antagonistic interactions was idiosyncratic in that it did not always magnify the effects of extinction order across the three networks. These results underscore the importance of considering the full spectrum of interaction outcomes when assessing robustness to coextinctions in plant-pollinator networks, as well as other ecological systems.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTranscranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial electric stimulation (TES) modulate brain activity non-invasively by generating electric fields either by electromagnetic induction or by injecting currents via skin electrodes. Numerical simulations based on anatomically detailed head models of the TMS and TES electric fields can help us to understand and optimize the spatial stimulation pattern in the brain. However, most realistic simulations are still slow, and their numerical accuracy and the factors that influence it have not been evaluated in detail so far.\n\nApproachWe present and validate a new implementation of the Finite Element Method (FEM) for TMS and TES that is based on modern algorithms and libraries. We also evaluate the convergence of the simulations and give estimates for the discretization errors.\n\nMain resultsComparisons with analytical solutions for spherical head models validate our new FEM implementation. It is five to ten times faster than previous implementations. The convergence results suggest that accurately capturing the tissue geometry in addition to choosing a sufficiently high mesh density is of fundamental importance for accurate simulations.\n\nSignificanceThe new implementation allows for a substantial increase in computational efficiency of TMS and TES simulations. This is especially relevant for applications such as the systematic assessment of model uncertainty and the optimization of multi-electrode TES montages. The results of our systematic error analysis allow the user to select the best tradeoff between model resolution and simulation speed for a specific application. The new FEM code will be made openly available as a part of our open-source software SimNIBS 3.0.",

    "abstract": "Algorithms to infer isoform expression abundance from RNA-seq have been greatly improved in accuracy during the past ten years. However, due to incomplete reference transcriptomes, mapping errors, incomplete sequencing bias models, or mistakes made by the algorithm, the quantification model sometimes could not explain all aspects of the input read data, and misquantification can occur. Here, we develop a computational method to detect instances where a quantification model could not thoroughly explain the input. Specifically, our approach identifies transcripts where the read coverage has significant deviations from the expectation. We call these transcripts \"expression anomalies\", and they represent instances where the quantification estimates may be in doubt. We further develop a method to attribute the cause of anomalies to either the incompleteness of the reference transcriptome or the algorithmic mistakes, and we show that our method precisely detects misquantifications with both causes. By correcting the misquantifications that are labeled as algorithmic mistakes, the number of false predictions of differentially expressed transcripts can be reduced. Applying anomaly detection to 30 GEUVADIS and 16 Human Body Map samples, we detect 103 genes with potential unannotated isoforms. These genes tend to be longer than average, and contain a very long exon near 3' end that the unannotated isoform excludes. Anomaly detection is a new approach for investigating the expression quantification problem that may find wider use in other areas of genomics.",

Here, we developed an integrated pipeline for automated quantification of cancer metastases and therapeutic antibody targeting, named DeepMACT. First, we enhanced the fluorescent signal of tumor cells more than 100-fold by applying the vDISCO method to image single cancer cells in intact transparent mice. Second, we developed deep learning algorithms for automated quantification of metastases with an accuracy matching human expert manual annotation. Deep learning-based quantifications in a model of spontaneous metastasis using human breast cancer cells allowed us to systematically analyze clinically relevant features such as size, shape, spatial distribution, and the degree to which metastases are targeted by a therapeutic monoclonal antibody in whole mice. DeepMACT can thus considerably improve the discovery of effective therapeutic strategies for metastatic cancer.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=137 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/541862v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (49K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ffe1b9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13c55eborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2ccb6corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@df55e9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Supplementary Movies and deep learning algorithms of DeepMACT are available at http://discotechnologies.org/DeepMACT/",

    "abstract": "Improving the end-use quality traits is one of the primary objectives in wheat breeding programs. In the current study, a population of 127 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between Glenn (PI-639273) and Traverse (PI-642780) was developed and used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for 16 end-use quality traits in wheat. The phenotyping of these 16 traits was performed in nine environments in North Dakota, USA. The genotyping for the RIL population was conducted using the wheat Illumina iSelect 90K SNP assay. A high-density genetic linkage map consisting of 7,963 SNP markers identified a total of 76 additive QTL (A-QTL) and 73 digenic epistatic QTL (DE-QTL) associated with these traits. Overall, 12 stable major A-QTL and three stable DE-QTL were identified for these traits, suggesting that both A-QTL and DE-QTL played an important role in controlling end-use quality traits in wheat. The most significant A-QTL (AQ.MMLPT.ndsu.1B) was detected on chromosome 1B for mixograph middle line peak time. The AQ.MMLPT.ndsu.1B A-QTL was located very close to the position of the Glu-B1 gene encoding for a subunit of high molecular weight glutenin and explained up to 24.43% of phenotypic variation for mixograph MID line peak time. A total of 23 co-localized QTL loci were detected, suggesting the possibility of the simultaneous improvement of the end-use quality traits through selection procedures in wheat breeding programs. Overall, the information provided in this study could be used in marker-assisted selection to increase selection efficiency and to improve the end-use quality in wheat.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, research has focused on the immunoreactive components of the S. schenckii cell wall that can be relevant targets for preventive and therapeutic vaccines against sporotrichosis, an emergent worldwide mycosis. In previous studies, we identified a 47-kDa enolase as an immunodominant antigen in mice vaccinated with purified fungal wall proteins and adjuvants. In this study, the immunolocalization of this immunogen in the cell wall of S. schenckii and S. brasiliensis is shown for the first time. In addition, a recombinant enolase of Sporothrix spp (rSsEno) was studied with the adjuvant Montanide Pet-GelA (PGA) as a vaccine candidate. The rSsEno was produced with high purity. In addition, mice immunized with rSsEno plus PGA showed increased antibody titers against enolase and increased median survival time comparedto nonimmunized or rSsEno-immunized mice. Enolase immunization induced a predominant T-helper-1 (Th1) cytokine pattern in splenic cells after in vitro stimulation with rSsEno. Elevated production of interferon-{gamma} (IFN-{gamma}) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) was observed with other cytokines involved in the innate immune defense, such as TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-4, which are necessary for antibody production. These results suggest that we should continue testing this antigen as a potential vaccine candidate against sporotrichosis.",

    "abstract": "The reovirus outer capsid protein 1 regulates cell death in infected cells. To distinguish between the role of incoming, capsid-associated and newly synthesized 1, we used siRNA-mediated knockdown. Loss of newly synthesized 1 protein does not impact apoptotic cell death in HeLa cells but enhances necroptosis in L929 cells. Knockdown of 1 also impacts aspects of viral replication. We found that while 1 knockdown results in diminished release of infectious viral progeny from infected cells, viral minus strand RNA, plus strand RNA, and proteins that are not targeted by the 1 siRNA accumulate to a greater extent when compared to control siRNA-treated cells. Furthermore, we observe a decrease in sensitivity of these viral products to inhibition by GuHCl (which targets minus strand synthesis to produce dsRNA) when 1 is knocked down. Following 1 knockdown, cell death is also less sensitive to treatment with GuHCl. Our studies suggest that the absence of 1 allows enhanced transcriptional activity of newly synthesized cores and the consequent accumulation of viral gene products. We speculate that enhanced accumulation and detection of these gene products due to a 1 knockdown potentiates RIP3 dependent cell death.\n\nIMPORTANCEWe use mammalian reovirus as a model to study how virus infections result in cell death. Here, we sought to determine how viral factors regulate cell death. Our work highlights a previously unknown role for reovirus outer capsid protein 1 in limiting the induction of a necrotic form of cell death called necroptosis. Induction of cell death by necroptosis requires the detection of viral gene products late in infection. 1 limits cell death by this mechanism because it prevents excessive accumulation of viral gene products that trigger cell death.",

    "abstract": "Short-term synaptic plasticity is widely found in many areas of the central nervous system. In particular, it is believed that synaptic depression can act as a mechanism to allow simple networks to generate a range of different firing patterns. The locomotor circuit of hatchling Xenopus tadpoles produces two types of behaviours: swimming and the slower, stronger struggling movement that is associated with rhythmic bends of the whole body. Struggling is accompanied by anti-phase bursts in neurons on each side of the spinal cord and is believed to be governed by a short-term synaptic depression of commissural inhibition. To better understand burst generation in struggling, we study a minimal network of two neurons coupled through depressing inhibitory synapses. Depending on the strength of the synaptic conductance between the two neurons, such a network can produce symmetric n - n anti-phase bursts, where neurons fire n spikes in alternation, with the period of such solutions increasing with the strength of the synaptic conductance. Relying on the timescale disparity in the model, we reduce the eight-dimensional network equations to a fully explicit scalar Poincare burst map. This map tracks the state of synaptic depression from one burst to the next, and captures the complex bursting dynamics of the network. Fixed points of this map are associated with stable burst solutions of the full network model, and are created through fold bifurcations of maps. We derive conditions that describe period increment bifurcations between stable n - n and (n + 1) - (n + 1) bursts, producing a full bifurcation diagram of the burst cycle period. Predictions of the Poincare map fit excellently with numerical simulations of the full network model, and allow the study of parameter sensitivity for rhythm generation.",

    "abstract": "Auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs) are auditory evoked potentials that reflect phase-locked neural activity to periodic stimuli. ASSRs are often evoked by tones with a modulated envelope, with sinusoidal envelopes being most common. However, it is unclear if and how the shape of the envelope affects ASSR responses. In this study, we used various trapezoidal modulated tones to evoke ASSRs (modulation frequency = 40 Hz) and studied the effect of four envelope parameters: attack time, hold time, decay time and off time. ASSR measurements in 20 normal hearing subjects showed that envelope shape significantly influenced responses: increased off time and/or increased decay time led to responses with a larger signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). Response phase delay was significantly influenced by attack time and to a lesser degree by off time. We also simulated neural population responses that approximate ASSRs with a model of the auditory periphery (Bruce et al. 2018). The modulation depth of the simulated responses, i.e. the difference between maximum and minimum firing rate, correlated highly with the response SNRs found in the ASSR measurements. Longer decay time and off time enhanced the modulation depth both by decreasing the minimum firing rate and by increasing the maximum firing rate. In conclusion, custom envelopes with long decay and off time provide larger response SNRs and the benefit over the commonly used sinusoidal envelope was in the range of several dB.",

    "abstract": "The aim of a number of psychophysics tasks is to uncover how mammals make decisions in a world that is in flux. Here we examine the characteristics of ideal and near-ideal observers in a task of this type. We ask when and how performance depends on task parameters and design, and, in turn, what observer performance tells us about their decision-making process. In the dynamic clicks task subjects hear two streams (left and right) of Poisson clicks with different rates. Subjects are rewarded when they correctly identify the side with the higher rate, as this side switches unpredictably. We show that a reduced set of task parameters defines regions in parameter space in which optimal, but not near-optimal observers, maintain constant response accuracy. We also show that for a range of task parameters an approximate normative model must be finely tuned to reach near-optimal performance, illustrating a potential way to distinguish between normative models and their approximations. In addition, we show that using the negative log-likelihood and the 0/1-loss functions to fit these types of models is not equivalent: the 0/1-loss leads to a bias in parameter recovery that increases with sensory noise. These findings suggest ways to tease apart models that are hard to distinguish when tuned exactly, and point to general pitfalls in experimental design, model fitting, and interpretation of the resulting data.",

    "abstract": "Global context can dramatically influence local visual perception. This phenomenon is well-documented for monocular features, e.g., the Kanizsa triangle. It has been demonstrated for binocular matching: the disambiguation of the Wallpaper Illusion (Brewster, 1844) via the luminance of the background (Anderson & Nakayama, 1994). For monocular features, there is evidence that global context can influence neuronal responses as early as V1 (Muckli et al., 2015). However, for binocular matching, the activity in this area of the visual cortex is thought to represent local processing, suggesting that the influence of global context may occur at later stages of cortical processing. Here we sought to test if binocular matching is influenced by contextual effects in V1, using fMRI to measure brain activity while participants viewed perceptually ambiguous \"wallpaper\" stereograms whose depth was disambiguated by the luminance of the surrounding region. We localized voxels in V1 corresponding to the ambiguous region of the pattern, i.e., where the signal received from the eyes was not predictive of depth, and despite the ambiguity of the input signal, using multi-voxel pattern analysis we were able to reliably decode perceived (near/far) depth from the activity of these voxels. These findings indicate that stereoscopic related neural activity is influenced by global context as early as V1.",

Although data collected from biomedical research is expanding at an almost exponential rate, our ability to transform that information into patient care has not kept at pace. A major barrier preventing this transformation is that multi-dimensional data collection and analysis is usually carried out without much understanding of the underlying knowledge structure. In an effort to bridge this gap, Electronic Health Records (EHRs) of individual patients were connected to a heterogeneous knowledge network called Scalable Precision Medicine Oriented Knowledge Engine (SPOKE). Then an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm was used to create Propagated SPOKE Entry Vectors (PSEVs) that encode the importance of each SPOKE node for any code in the EHRs. We argue that these results, alongside the natural integration of PSEVs into any EHR machine-learning platform, provide a key step toward precision medicine.",

Patient models were merged to characterize healthy-, disease- and drug-specific signaling networks. We defined a co-druggability score based on the topology for each drugs network. We used this score to identify kinase interactions whose activity could be reverted to a \"healthy-like\" status by combination therapy. We predicted several combinations with approved MS drugs. Specifically, TAK1 kinase, involved in TGF-B, toll-like receptor, B-cell receptor and response to inflammation pathways was found to be highly deregulated and co-druggable with four MS drugs. One of these predicted combinations, Fingolimod with a TAK1 inhibitor, was validated in an animal model of MS. Our approach based on patient-specific signaling networks enables prediction of targets for combination therapy for MS and other complex diseases.\n\nOne sentence summaryA new approach to predict combination therapies based on modeling signaling architecture using phosphoproteomics from patients with Multiple Sclerosis characterizes deregulated signaling pathways and reveals new therapeutic targets and drug combinations.",

    "abstract": "In genome-wide association studies, the extent and impact of confounding due population structure have been well recognized. Inadequate handling of such confounding is likely to lead to spurious associations, hampering replication and the identification of causal variants. Several strategies have been developed for protecting associations against confounding, the most popular one is based on Principal Component Analysis. In contrast, the extent and impact of confounding due to population structure in gene-gene interaction association epistasis studies are much less investigated and understood. In particular, the role of non-linear genetic population substructure in epistasis detection is largely under-investigated, especially outside a regression framework. In order to identify causal variants in synergy, to improve interpretability and replicability of epistasis results, we introduce three strategies based on model-based multifactor dimensionality reduction (MB-MDR) approach for structured populations. We demonstrate through extensive simulation studies the effect of various degrees of genetic population structure and relatedness on epistasis detection and propose appropriate remedial measures based on linear and non-linear sample genetic similarity.\n\nAuthors SummaryOne of the biggest challenges in human genetics is to understand the genetic basis of complex diseases such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, depression, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease and hypertension, for instance via identifying genes, gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in association studies. Over the years, a more prominent role has been given to gene-gene interaction (epistasis) detection, in view of precision medicine and the hunt for novel drug targets and biomarkers. However, the increasing number of consortium-based epistasis studies that are marked by heterogeneous sample collections due to population structure or shared genetic ancestry are likely to be prone to spurious association and low power detection of associated or causal genes. In this work we introduced various strategies in epistasis studies with correction for confounding due to population structure. Based on extensive simulation studies we demonstrated the effect of genetic population structure on epistasis detection and investigated remedial measures to confounding by linear and nonlinear sample genetic similarity.",

    "abstract": "Recent progress in Next Generation Sequencing allows us to explore the diversity of airborne microorganisms across time and space. However, few studies have used consecutive short-period samples to explore correlations between the seasonal variation of the microbiota and meteorology. In order to understand airborne bacterial community dynamics over Tokyo, including fine-scale correlations between airborne microorganisms and meteorological conditions, and the influence of local versus long-range transport of microbes, air samples were continuously taken from a platform at the 458-m level of the Tokyo Skytree (a 634-m-high broadcasting tower in Tokyo) from August 2016 to February 2017. Predicted source regions of airborne particles, from back trajectory analyses, changed abruptly from the Pacific Ocean to the Eurasian Continent in the beginning of October. However, microbial community composition and alpha and beta diversities were not affected by this meteorological regime shift, suggesting that long-range transport from ocean or continent was not the principal determinant controlling the local airborne microbiome. By contrast, local meteorology, especially relative humidity and wind speed, had significant relationships with both alpha diversities and beta diversity. Among four potential local source categories (soil, bay seawater, river, and pond), bay seawater and soil were constant and predominant sources. Statistical analyses suggest humidity is the most influential meteorological factor, most likely because it is correlated with soil moisture and hence negatively correlated with the dispersal of particles from the land surface.",

    "abstract": "We used GWAS in the Million Veteran Program sample (nearly 200,000 informative individuals) using a continuous trait for anxiety (GAD-2) to identify 5 genome-wide significant (GWS) signals for European Americans (EA) and 1 for African Americans. The strongest findings were on chromosome 3 (rs4603973, p=7.40x10-11) near the SATB1 locus, a global regulator of gene expression and on chromosome 6 (rs6557168, p=1.04x10-9) near ESR1 which encodes estrogen receptor . A locus identified on chromosome 7 near MADIL1 (p=1.62x10-8) has been previously identified in GWAS of bipolar disorder and of schizophrenia and may represent a risk factor for psychiatric disorders broadly. SNP-based heritability was estimated to be ~6% for GAD-2. We also GWASed for self-reported anxiety disorder diagnoses (N=224,330) and identified two GWS loci, one (rs35546597, MAF=0.42, p=1.88x10-8) near the AURKB locus, and the other (rsl0534613, MAF=0.41, p=4.92x10-8) near the IQCHE and MADIL1 locus identified in the GAD-2 analysis. We demonstrate reproducibility by replicating our top findings in the summary statistics from the Anxiety NeuroGenetics Study (ANGST) and a UK Biobank neuroticism GWAS. We also replicated top findings from a large UK Biobank preprint, demonstrating stability of GWAS findings in complex traits once sufficient power is attained. Finally, we found evidence of significant genetic overlap between anxiety and major depression using polygenic risk scores, but also found that the main anxiety signals are independent of those for MDD. This work presents novel insights into the neurobiological risk underpinning anxiety and related psychiatric disorders.\n\nSignificanceAnxiety disorders are common and often disabling. They are also frequently co-morbid with other mental disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD); these disorders may share commonalities in their underlying genetic architecture. Using one of the largest homogenously phenotyped cohorts available, the Million Veteran Program sample, we investigated common variants associated with anxiety in genome-wide association studies (GWASes), using survey results from the GAD-2 anxiety scale (as a continuous trait, n=199,611), and self-reported anxiety disorder diagnosis (as a binary trait, n=224,330). This largest GWAS to date for anxiety and related traits identified numerous novel significant associations, several of which are replicated in other datasets, and allows inference of underlying biology.",

    "abstract": "Black Aspergilli are, the most causes of aspergillosis and Aspergillus niger and A. tubingensis are two more frequently isolates. Although, amphotericin B was a gold standard for the treatment of invasive fungal infection for several decades, it replaced by several new antifungals. Furthermore, a novel antifungal, luliconazole, appears to offer the potential for improved therapy for aspergillosis. The aim of the present study was to compare the effect of a novel antifungal agent, luliconazole, with classical antifungal against clinical and environmental strains of black Aspergilli. Sixty seven strains of black Aspergilli were identified using morphological and molecular tests ({beta}-Tubulin gene). Antifungal susceptibility test was applied according to CLSI M38 A2. The results were reported as MIC range, MIC50, MIC90 and MICGM. In the present study, A. niger was the common isolate followed by, A. tubingensis and 54.1% (clinical) and 30% (environmental) of isolates were resistant to caspofungin. The highest resistant rate was found in amphotericin B for both clinical (86.5%) and environmental (96.7%) strains. Clinical strains of Aspergillus were more sensitive to voriconazole (86.7%) than environmental strains (70.3%). On the other hand, 83.8% of clinical and 70% of environmental isolates were resistant to posaconazole, respectively. It is found that the lowest MIC range, MIC50, MIC90, and MICGM was attributed to luliconazole in clinical strains. In conclusion, luliconazole vs. routine antifungal is a potent antifungal for A. niger complex in vitro. The MIC range, MIC50, MIC90 and MICGM of luliconazole against black Aspergilli were the lowest among the representative tested antifungals.",

    "abstract": "Legionnaires Disease (LD) is a severe pneumonia caused by Legionella pneumophila. Cooling towers are the main source of L. pneumophila during large outbreaks. Colonization, survival, and proliferation of L. pneumophila in cooling towers are necessary for outbreaks to occur. These steps are affected by chemical and physical parameters of the cooling tower environment. We hypothesize that the bacterial community residing in the cooling tower could also affect the presence of L. pneumophila. A 16S rRNA targeted amplicon sequencing approach was used to study the bacterial community of cooling towers and its relationship with the Legionella spp. and L. pneumophila communities. The results indicated that the water source shaped the bacterial community of cooling towers. Several taxa were enriched and positively correlated with Legionella spp. and L. pneumophila. In contrast, Pseudomonas showed a strong negative correlation with Legionella spp. and several other genera. Most importantly, continuous chlorine application reduced microbial diversity and promoted the presence of Pseudomonas creating a non-permissive environment for Legionella spp. This suggests that disinfection strategies as well as the resident microbial population influences the ability of Legionella spp. to colonize cooling towers.",

    "abstract": "Plant volatile detection through olfaction plays a crucial role in insect behaviors. In vivo, the odorant receptor co-receptor orco is an obligatory component for the function of odorant receptors (ORs), a major receptor family involved in insect olfaction. We used CRISPR-Cas9 targeted mutagenesis to knock-out (KO) orco in a neurophysiological model species, the hawkmoth Manduca sexta. M. sexta and its host, the Sacred Datura (Datura wrightii) share a model insect-plant relationship based on mutualistic and antagonistic life history traits. D. wrightii is the innately preferred nectar-source and oviposition host for M. sexta. Hence, the hawkmoth is an important pollinator while the M. sexta larvae are specialized herbivores of the plant. We generated an orco KO through CRISPR-Cas9 to test the consequences of a loss of OR-mediated olfaction in this insect-plant relationship. Neurophysiological characterization revealed severely reduced antennal and antennal lobe responses to representative odorants emitted by D. wrightii. In a wind-tunnel setting with a flowering plant, orco KO hawkmoths showed disrupted flight orientation and an ablated proboscis extension response to the natural stimulus. However, when testing the oviposition behavior of mated females encountering a non-flowering plant, there was no difference between orco KO and wild type females regarding upwind flight orientation and number of eggs laid. Overall, OR-mediated olfaction is essential for foraging and pollination behaviors, but plant-seeking and oviposition behaviors appear largely unaffected.\n\nSignificance statementInsects detect plant volatiles mainly through the expression of ORs and IRs on the antennal olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). In vivo, Orco is an obligate partner for OR, but not IR function and ORs mediate a vast spectrum of olfactory perception. We applied CRISPR-Cas9 in M. sexta to mutate the orco gene and determine the physiological and behavioral implication of a loss of Orco receptor function in a semi-ecological interaction with D. wrightii. We found that while behaviors related to foraging were largely disrupted, other sensory modalities outside Orco function determine the relationship between an ovipositing female and its plant host. These results have implications toward understanding the olfactory basis of insect-plant interactions shaping our ecological and agricultural landscapes.",

We introduce the Structured Event Memory (SEM) model of event cognition, which accounts for human abilities in event segmentation, memory, and generalization. SEM is derived from a probabilistic generative model of event dynamics defined over structured symbolic scenes. By embedding symbolic scene representations in a vector space and parametrizing the scene dynamics in this continuous space, SEM combines the advantages of structured and neural network approaches to high-level cognition. Using probabilistic reasoning over this generative model, SEM can infer event boundaries, learn event schemata, and use event knowledge to reconstruct past experience. We show that SEM can scale up to high-dimensional input spaces, producing human-like event segmentation for naturalistic video data, and accounts for a wide array of memory phenomena.",

    "abstract": "Objective. Neural responses recorded using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) can be used to study how our brain functions, as well as for various promising brain computer interface (BCI) applications. However, a common problem is the low signal to noise ratio (SNR) which makes it challenging to estimate task-related neural responses or the temporal response function (TRF) describing the linear relationship between the stimulus and the neural response, particularly over short data windows. To address these, we present an algorithm that takes advantage of the multi-channel nature of the recordings, and knowledge of the presented stimulus, to achieve a joint noise reduction and dimensionality reduction using spatial filtering. Methods. Forward modeling is used to project the stimulus onto the electrode space. The second-order statistics of this estimated desired signal and the raw neural data are used to estimate spatial filters that maximize the SNR of the neural response, based on a generalized eigenvalue decomposition. Main Results. 1. For synthesized EEG data, over a range of SNRs, our filtering resulted in significantly better TRF estimates from 20 s trials, compared to unfiltered EEG data. 2. On a dataset from 28 subjects who listened to a single-talker stimulus, our method resulted in correlations between predicted neural responses and the original EEG data that were significantly higher compared to standard approaches. 3. On a dataset of 16 subjects attending to 1 speaker in a two-speaker scenario, our method resulted in attention decoding accuracies which were higher compared to existing forward modelling methods. Significance. Our algorithm presents a data-driven way to denoise and reduce dimensionality of neural data, thus aiding further analysis, by utilizing the knowledge of the stimulus. The method is computationally efficient, and does not require repeated trials, thereby relieving experiment design from the necessity of presenting repeated stimuli to the subjects.",

    "abstract": "The role of the gut microbiome in critical illness is being actively investigated, but the optimal sampling methods for sequencing studies of gut microbiota remain unknown. Stool samples are generally considered gold-standard but are not practical to obtain in the intensive care unit (ICU), and thus, rectal swabs are often used. However, the reliability of rectal swabs for gut microbiome profiling has not been established in this clinical setting. In this study, we compared 16S rRNA gene sequencing results between rectal swab and stool samples collected at three timepoints in mechanically-ventilated critically-ill adults. Rectal swabs comprised 89% of samples collected at the baseline timepoint, but stool samples became more available at later time-points. Significant differences in alpha and beta-diversity between rectal swabs and stool samples were observed (p<0.003), but these differences were primarily due to baseline samples. Higher relative abundance of Actinobacteria phyla (typically skin microbes) was present in rectal swabs compared to stool samples (p<0.02), a difference that was attenuated overtime. The progressive similarity of rectal swabs and stool samples likely results from increasing stool coating of the rectal vault and direct soiling of the rectal swabs taken at later time points. Therefore, inferences about the role of the gut microbiome in critical illness should be drawn cautiously and take into account the actual type and timing of samples analyzed.\n\nStatement of ImportanceRectal swabs are considered reliable alternatives to stool samples for gut microbiome profiling in outpatients or healthy adults, but their reliability in critically-ill patients has not been defined. Because stool sampling is not practical or often feasible in the intensive care unit, we performed a detailed comparison of gut microbial sequencing profiles between rectal swabs vs. stool samples in a longitudinal cohort of critically-ill patients. We identified systematic differences in gut microbial profiles between rectal swabs and stool samples, and highlighted that timing of rectal swabbing had a significant impact on sequencing results. Our methodological findings should inform future investigations of the role of the gut microbiome in critical illness.",

    "abstract": "In every cell ribonucleotides represent a threat to the stability and transmission of the DNA genome. Two types of Ribonuclease H (RNase H) tackle such ribonucleotides, either by excision when they form part of the DNA strand, or by hydrolysing RNA when it base-pairs with DNA, in structures termed R-loops. Loss of either RNase H is lethal in mammals, whereas yeast can prosper in the absence of both enzymes. Removal of RNase H1 is tolerated by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei but no work has examined the function of RNase H2. Here we show that loss of the catalytic subunit of T. brucei RNase H2 (TbRH2A) leads to growth and cell cycle arrest that is concomitant with accumulation of nuclear damage at sites of RNA polymerase (Pol) II transcription initiation, revealing a novel and critical role for RNase H2. In addition, differential gene expression of both RNA Pol I and II transcribed genes occurs after TbRH2A loss, including patterns that may relate to cytosolic DNA accumulation in humans with autoimmune disease. Finally, we show that TbRH2A loss causes R-loop and DNA damage accumulation in telomeric RNA Pol I transcription sites, leading to altered variant surface glycoprotein expression. Thus, we demonstrate a separation of function between the two nuclear T. brucei RNase H enzymes during RNA Pol II transcription, but overlap in function during RNA Pol I-mediated gene expression during host immune evasion.",

    "abstract": "Capturing early changes in the brain related to Alzheimers disease may lead to models that successfully predict cognitive decline and the eventual onset of dementia, well ahead of onset of clinical symptoms. In this study we used both hippocampal volume and our hippocampal driven SNIPE score to show which marker better captures Alzheimers related changes in a large dataset of normal controls (N=515) from the ADNI study, comparing controls that remain cognitively stable and controls that progress to either MCI or Alzheimers dementia during 10 years of follow-up (median follow-up: 30 months). We measured hippocampal volume and SNIPE score and found that the effect size to differentiate between stable and progressor groups was significantly larger for SNIPE score than for volume. Our results also show that there is a significant age-related difference between groups for both markers, and the difference is greater with the SNIPE score. Our experiments show that considering high sensitivity of our SNIPE score regarding to early AD-related brain changes, this marker is a better candidate in comparison to hippocampal volume for predicting the future onset of dementia.",

    "abstract": "While gene expression profiling is commonly used to gain an overview of cellular processes, the identification of upstream processes that drive expression changes remains a challenge. To address this issue, we introduce CARNIVAL, a causal network building tool which derives network architectures from gene expression footprints.\n\nCARNIVAL (CAusal Reasoning pipeline for Network identification using Integer VALue programming) integrates different sources of prior knowledge, including signed and directed protein-protein interactions, transcription factor targets, and pathway signatures. The use of prior knowledge in CARNIVAL allows the capture of a broad set of upstream cellular processes and regulators, which in turn delivered results with higher accuracy when benchmarked against related tools. Implementation as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem also guarantees efficient computation. As a case study, we applied CARNIVAL to contextualize signaling networks from gene expression data in IgA nephropathy, a chronic kidney disease. CARNIVAL identified specific signaling pathways and associated mediators with important bioactivity in IgAN including WNT and TGF-{beta}, that we subsequently validated experimentally.\n\nIn summary, we demonstrated how CARNIVAL generates hypotheses on potential upstream alterations that propagate through signaling networks, providing valuable insights into disease processes. CARNIVAL, freely available as an R-package at https://saezlab.github.io/CARNIVAL, can be applied to any field of biomedical research to contextualize signaling networks and identify the causal relationships between downstream gene expression and upstream regulators.",

    "abstract": "There is a renewed interest in recent years on the ecological processes (stochastic vs selective) driving the assembly of microbial communities. Such information could potentially improve our understanding on ecosystem functioning and resilience to disturbances, ecosystem response to environmental shifts, and adoption of sustainable soil management practices. Herein, employing a suite of existing methodologies, we show that stochastic processes have an important role on the assembly of soil bacterial communities at a Mediterranean watershed. Moreover, we document that the relative contribution of assembly processes varies over the years. The observed intensification of stochastic processes was accompanied by a decrease in the contribution of variable selection in favor of homogeneous selection and dispersal and this trend was only marginally affected by land use (natural vs agricultural lands) or soil depth. Our study also revealed a high inter-annual turnover of soil microbial communities that was likely stimulated by the weak environmental selection and the prevailing environmental conditions (drying-wetting cycles) in Mediterranean landscapes, implying potential impacts on ecosystem functioning and our ability to predict soil response to environmental shifts. Using nitrogen mineralization rate (NMR) as a representative function we document highly variable NMR over the sampling years, land uses and soil depths and lack of significant associations with the monitored environmental variables and individual taxa. In summary, our study provides novel insights on the organization and functioning of microbial communities at Mediterranean ecosystems and sets directions towards a more advanced understanding of the relationships among environmental factors, microbial community structure, and ecosystem functioning that could contribute to sustainable management of these severely degraded ecosystems.",

We used natural stable isotopes, elemental analyses, and stable isotope probing to study the ecological stoichiometry of a lucinid symbiosis in spring and fall. Chemoautotrophy appeared to dominate in fall, when chemoautotrophic carbon fixation rates were up to one order of magnitude higher as compared to the spring, suggesting a flexible nutritional mutualism. In fall, an isotope pool dilution experiment revealed carbon limitation of the symbiosis and ammonium excretion rates up to 10-fold higher compared to fluxes reported for non-symbiotic marine bivalves. These results provide evidence that lucinid bivalves can contribute substantial amounts of ammonium to the ecosystem. Given the preference of seagrasses for this nitrogen source, lucinid bivalves contribution may boost productivity of these important blue carbon ecosystems.",

How TLR5 signaling deficiency results in T5-dysbiosis is unclear. Here, we address the role of B cells in T-dysbiosis. We observed that B cells do not express TLR5, and that B cell transplantation from TLR5-/- mouse donors into B-cell deficient mice resulted in a slight reduction in Flic-IgA levels compared to B-cells from WT donors. Bone marrow transplants from WT and TLR5-/- donors into recipients of both genotypes confirmed that TLR5 signaling by non-hematopoietic cells is required for T5-dysbiosis. We observed TLR5 deficiency was associated with an expanded population of IgA+ B cells. TLR5-/- mice tended to have higher richness for the IgA gene hypervariable region (CDR3 gene) variants. Transplantation of microbiomes from TLR5-/- and WT microbiomes donors into germfree mice resulted in a higher proportion of IgA-secreting B cells, and higher overall fecal IgA and anti-Flic IgA for TLR5-/- microbiome recipients. This observation indicated that the TLR5-/- mouse microbiome elicits an anti-flagellin antibody response that requires TLR5 signaling. Together these results indicate that TLR5 signaling on epithelial cells influences B cell populations and antibody repertoire.",

    "abstract": "Structured information is easier to remember and recall than random one. In real life, information exhibits multi-level hierarchical organization, such as clauses, sentences, episodes and narratives in language. Here we show that multi-level grouping emerges even when participants perform memory recall experiments with random sets of words. To quantitatively probe brain mechanisms involved in memory structuring, we consider an experimental protocol where participants perform  final free recall (FFR) of several random lists of words each of which was first presented and recalled individually. We observe a hierarchy of grouping organizations of FFR, most notably many participants sequentially recalled relatively long chunks of words from each list before recalling words from another list. More-over, participants who exhibited strongest organization during FFR achieved highest levels of performance. Based on these results, we develop a hierarchical model of memory recall that is broadly compatible with our findings. Our study shows how highly controlled memory experiments with random and meaningless material, when combined with simple models, can be used to quantitatively probe the way meaningful information can efficiently be organized and processed in the brain, so to be easily retrieved.\n\nSignificance StatementInformation that people communicate to each other is highly structured. For example, a story contains meaningful elements of various degrees of complexity (clauses, sentences, episodes etc). Recalling a story, we are chiefly concerned with these meaningful elements and not its exact wording. Here we show that people introduce structure even when recalling random lists of words, by grouping the words into  chunks of various sizes. Doing so improves their performance. The so formed chunks closely correspond in size to story elements described above. This suggests that our memory is trained to create a structure that resembles the one it typically deals with in real life, and that using random material like word lists can be used to quantitatively probe these memory mechanisms.",

We used CPM to determine whether brain \"fingerprints\" evoked during milkshake consumption could be isolated for common measures of adiposity in 67 overweight and obese adults. We found that a CPM could be identified for waist circumference, but not percent body fat or BMI, the most frequently used measures to assess brain correlates of obesity. In an exploratory analysis, we were also able to derive a largely distinct CPM predicting fasting blood insulin. These findings demonstrate that brain network patterns are more tightly coupled to waist circumference than BMI or percent body fat and that adiposity and glucose tolerance are associated with distinct maps, pointing to dissociable central pathophysiological phenotypes for obesity and diabetes.",

Deviants differed in frequency (F), intensity (I), perceived location (L), or any combination of these (FI, IL, LF, FIL). Neural processing overlap was assessed through MMNm additivity by comparing double- and triple-deviant MMNms (\"empirical\") to summed constituent single-deviant MMNms (\"modelled\"). Significantly greater subadditivity was present in musicians compared to non-musicians, specifically for frequency-related deviants in complex contexts.

    "abstract": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) represents one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Given the healthcare risks and societal impacts associated with CAD, their clinical management would benefit from improved prevention and prediction tools. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) based on an individuals genome sequence are emerging as potentially powerful biomarkers to predict the risk to develop CAD. Two recently derived genome-wide PRS have shown high specificity and sensitivity to identify CAD cases in European-ancestry participants from the UK Biobank. However, validation of the PRS predictive power and transferability in other populations is now required to support their clinical utility. We calculated both PRS (GPSCAD and metaGRSCAD) in French-Canadian individuals from three cohorts totaling 3639 prevalent CAD cases and 7382 controls, and tested their power to predict prevalent, incident and recurrent CAD. We also estimated the impact of the founder French-Canadian familial hypercholesterolemia deletion (LDLR delta > 15kb deletion) on CAD risk in one of these cohorts and used this estimate to calibrate the impact of the PRS. Our results confirm the ability of both PRS to predict prevalent CAD comparable to the original reports (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.72-0.84). Furthermore, the PRS identified about 6-7% of individuals at CAD risk similar to carriers of the LDLR delta > 15kb mutation, consistent with previous estimates. However, the PRS did not perform as well in predicting incident (AUC= 0.56 - 0.60) or recurrent (AUC= 0.56 - 0.60) CAD. This result suggests that additional work is warranted to better understand how ascertainment biases and study design impact PRS for CAD. Collectively, our results confirm that novel, genome-wide PRS are able to predict CAD in French-Canadians; with further improvements, this is likely to pave the way towards more targeted strategies to predict and prevent CAD-related adverse events.",

Although widely recognized for their mutability and utility, the mutation rates of microsatellites have only been empirically estimated in a few species and have rarely been compared across genotypes and populations and intraspecific differences in overall microsatellite content have rarely been explored. To investigate the accumulation of microsatellite DNA over long-and short-time periods, we quantified the abundance and genome-wide mutation rates in whole-genome sequences of 47 mutation accumulation (MA) lines and 12 non-MA lines derived from six different genotypes of the crustacean Daphnia magna collected from three populations (Finland, Germany, and Israel). Each genotype possessed a distinctive microsatellite profile and clustered according to their population of origin. During the period of mutation accumulation, we observed very high microsatellite mutation rates (a net change of -0.19 to 0.33 per copy per generation), which surpass rates reported from a closely-related congener, D. pulex, by an order of magnitude. Rates vary between microsatellite motifs and among genotypes, with those starting with high microsatellite content exhibiting greater losses and those with low microsatellite content exhibiting greater gains. Our results show that microsatellite mutation rates depend both on characteristics of the microsatellites and the genomic background. These context-dependent mutation dynamics may, in conjunction with other evolutionary forces that may differ among populations, explain the differential accumulation of repeat content in the genome over long time periods.",

    "abstract": "Microcystis is a genus of freshwater cyanobacteria which causes harmful blooms in ecosystems worldwide. Some Microcystis strains produce harmful toxins such as microcystin, impacting drinking water quality. Microcystis colony morphology, rather than genetic similarity, is often used to classify Microcystis into morphospecies. However, colony morphology is a plastic trait which can change depending on environmental and laboratory culture conditions, and is thus an inadequate criterion for species delineation. Furthermore, Microcystis populations are thought to disperse globally and constitute a homogeneous gene pool. However, this assertion is based on relatively incomplete characterization of Microcystis genomic diversity. To better understand these issues, we performed a population genomic analysis of 33 newly sequenced genomes (of which 19 were resequenced to check for mutation in culture) mainly from Canada and Brazil. We identified eight Microcystis clusters of genomic similarity, only four of which correspond to named morphospecies and monophyletic groups. Notably, M. aeruginosa is paraphyletic, distributed across four genomic clusters, suggesting it is not a coherent species. Most monophyletic groups are specific to a unique geographic location, suggesting biogeographic structure over relatively short evolutionary time scales. Higher homologous recombination rates within than between clusters further suggest that monophyletic groups might adhere to a Biological Species-like concept, in which barriers to gene flow maintain species distinctness. However, certain genes - including some involved in microcystin and micropeptin biosynthesis - are recombined between monophyletic groups in the same geographic location, suggesting local adaptation. Together, our results show the importance of using genomic criteria for Microcystis species delimitation and suggest the existence of locally adapted lineages and genes.\n\nImportanceThe genus Microcystis is responsible for harmful and often toxic cyanobacterial blooms across the world, yet it is unclear how and if the genus should be divided into ecologically and genomically distinct species. To resolve the controversy and uncertainty surrounding Microcystis species, we performed a population genomic analysis of Microcystis genome from public databases, along with new isolates from Canada and Brazil. We inferred that significant genetic substructure exists within Microcystis, with several species being maintained by barriers to gene flow. Thus, Microcystis appears to be among a growing number of bacteria that adhere to a Biological Species-like Concept (BSC). Barriers to gene flow are permeable, however, and we find evidence for relatively frequent cross-species horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of genes that may be involved in local adaptation. Distinct clades of Microcystis (putative species) tend to have distinct profiles of toxin biosynthesis genes, and yet toxin genes are also subject to cross-species HGT and local adaptation. Our results thus pave the way for more informed classification, monitoring and understanding of harmful Microcystis blooms.",

Here, we fine-mapped a grain weight QTL using wild emmer introgressions in a durum wheat background, and showed that grain weight is associated with the GNI-A1 gene, a regulator of floret fertility. In-depth characterization of grain number and grain weight indicated that suppression of distal florets by the wild emmer GNI-A1 allele increase weight of proximal grains in basal and central spikelets due to alteration in assimilate distribution. Re-sequencing of GNI-A1 in tetraploid wheat demonstrated the rich allelic repertoire of the wild emmer gene pool, including a rare allele which was present in two gene copies and contained a non-synonymous mutation in the C-terminus of the protein. Using an F2 population generated from a cross between wild emmer accessions Zavitan, which carries the rare allele, and TTD140, we demonstrated that this unique polymorphism is associated with grain weight, independent of grain number. Moreover, we showed, for the first time, that GNI-A1 proteins are transcriptional activators and that selection in domesticated wheat targeted compromised activity of the protein. Our finding expand the knowledge of the genetic basis underlying trade-off between key yield components and may contribute to breeding efforts for enhanced grain yield.",

    "abstract": "The surveillance of antimicrobial resistant isolates has proven to be one of the most valuable tools to understand the global rise of multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens. We report the first insights into the current situation in the Caribbean, where a pilot project to monitor antimicrobial resistance through phenotypic resistance measurements combined with whole-genome sequencing was set up in collaboration with the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA). Our first study focused on Klebsiella pneumoniae, a highly relevant organism amongst the Gram-negative opportunistic pathogens world-wide today causing hospital, as well as community-acquired, infections. Our results show that not only carbapenem resistance, but also hypervirulent strains, are circulating in patients in the Caribbean. Our current data does not allow us to infer their prevalence in the population. We argue for the urgent need to further support antimicrobial resistance surveillance and stewardship in this almost uncharted territory, which can make a significant impact on the reduction of antimicrobial usage.\n\nDATA SUMMARY-Raw sequencing data is deposited at the sequence read archive (SRA), and assemblies are deposited at GenBank, accession numbers for all are given in Dataset S1.\n-The data of measured resistance phenotypes (Vitek) is also provided in Dataset S1.\n-The tree file and associated metadata can be investigated and downloaded through the free online platform microreact (https://microreact.org/project/S1-a7KAkV).{checkmark} I/We confirm all supporting data, code and protocols have been provided within the article or through supplementary data files. {boxtimes}\n\n\n\nSignificance as a BioResource to the communityThis BioResource contains whole-genome sequence data of 270 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, information about encoded resistance genes and the phylogeny of the isolates, their distribution in the global K. pneumoniae population, and their resistance phenotype data as determined by the VITEK 2 compact system. The isolates are recent (2017 through 2018) and represent clinically relevant patient isolates from 15 different sites in 12 Caribbean states. These data will be of interest for researchers working on K. pneumoniae and other opportunistic pathogens as well as those interested in mobile genetic elements carrying antimicrobial resistance cassettes. Our data is the only recent survey of antimicrobial resistant opportunistic pathogens from multiple sites within the Caribbean, and is of high significance for the global surveillance of K. pneumoniae and antimicrobial resistance elements.

    "abstract": "Microbial communities in nature often feature complex compositional dynamics yet also stable coexistence of diverse species. The mechanistic underpinnings of such dynamic stability remain unclear as system-wide studies have been limited to small engineered communities or synthetic assemblies. Here we show how kefir, a natural milk-fermenting community, realizes stable coexistence through spatio-temporal orchestration of species and metabolite dynamics. During milk fermentation, kefir grains (a polysaccharide matrix synthesized by kefir microbes) grow in mass but remain unchanged in composition. In contrast, the milk is colonized in a dynamic fashion with early members opening metabolic niches for the followers. Through large-scale mapping of metabolic preferences and inter-species interactions, we show how microbes poorly suited for milk survive in, and even dominate, the community through metabolic cooperation and uneven partitioning between the grain and the liquid phase. Overall, our findings reveal how spatio-temporal dynamics promote stable coexistence and have implications for deciphering and modulating complex microbial ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Unliganded nuclear receptors have been implicated in ligand-dependent gene regulation. However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we demonstrate that unliganded ER binds to specific sites in the genome thereby pre-marking them as future functional enhancers. Upon ligand exposure, ER binds to several EREs relatively proximal to the pre-marked, or persistent, ER-bound sites. Interestingly, the persistent sites interact extensively, via chromatin looping, with the proximal transiently bound sites forming ER clustered enhancers in 3D. CRISPR-based deletion of TFF1 persistent site disrupts the formation of its clustered enhancer resulting in the loss of E2-dependent induced expression of TFF1 and its neighboring genes within the same cluster. The clustered enhancers overlap with nuclear ER puncta that coalesce in a ligand-dependent manner. Furthermore, formation of clustered enhancers, as well as puncta, coincide with the active phase of signaling and their later disappearance results in the loss of gene expression even though persistent sites remain bound by ER. Our results establish the role of persistent unliganded ER binding in priming enhancer clusters in 3D that drive transient, but robust, gene expression in a ligand-dependent fashion.",

    "abstract": "Ongoing climate change has been reported to have far-reaching impact on crop development and yield in many regions of the globe including Europe. However, little is known about the potential impact of climate change on specific stages of the crop cycle including crop establishment, although it is a crucial stage of the annual crop cycles. For the first time, we performed a simulation study to pinpoint how sugar beet sowing conditions of the next eight decades will be altered under future climate change and if these variations will affect sowing dates, germination and emergence as well as bolting rates of this crop. We chose Northern France as an important study site, representative of sugar beet growing basin in Northern Europe. Sugar beet emergence simulations were performed for a period between 2020 and 2100, taking into account five sowing dates (mid-February, 1st March, mid-March, 1st April and mid-April). Soil water contents and temperatures in the 0-10 cm soil horizon were first simulated with the STICS soil-crop model using the most pessimistic IPCC scenario (RCP 8.5) to feed the SIMPLE crop emergence model. We also evaluated the probability of field access for the earlier sowings, based on the amount of cumulated rainfall during February and March. When analyzed by sowing date and for successive 20-year period from 2020 to 2100, there was a significant increase in seedbed temperatures by 2{degrees}C after 2060 while no change in cumulative rainfall was found before and after sowings, compared with the past. Emergence rate was generally higher for 2081-2100, while time to reach the maximum emergence rate decreased by about one week, compared with other periods, due to higher average seedbed temperatures. The rate of non-germinated seeds decreased, especially for the earlier sowing dates, but the frequency of non-emergence due to water stress increased after 2060 for all sowing dates, including the mid-February sowing. Bolting remains a risk for sowings before mid-March although this risk will be markedly decreased after 2060. The changes in seedbed conditions will be significant after 2060 in terms of temperatures. However, the possibility of field access will be a main limiting factor for earlier sowings, as no significant changes in cumulative rainfall, compared with the past, will occur under future climate change. When field access is not a constraint, an anticipation of the sowing date, compared to the currently practiced sowing (i.e. mid-March), will lead to decreased risks for the sugar beet crop establishment and bolting. The use of future climate scenarios coupled with a crop model allows a precise insight into the future sowing conditions, and provide helpful information to better project future farming systems.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMany traits evolve by cis-regulatory modification, by which changes to non-coding sequences affect the binding affinity for available transcription factors and thus modify the expression profile of genes. Multiple examples of cis-regulatory evolution have been described at pattern switch genes responsible for butterfly wing pattern polymorphism, including in the diverse neotropical genus Heliconius, but the identities of the factors that can regulate these switch genes have not been identified.\n\nResultsWe investigated the spatial transcriptomic landscape across the wings of three closely related butterfly species, two of which have a convergently-evolved, co-mimetic pattern, the other having a divergent pattern. We identified candidate factors for regulating the expression of wing patterning genes, including transcription factors with a conserved expression profile in all three species, and others, including both transcription factors and Wnt pathway genes, with markedly different profiles in each of the three species. We verified the conserved expression profile of the transcription factor homothorax by immunofluorescence, and showed that its expression profile strongly correlates with that of the selector gene optix in butterflies with the Amazonian forewing pattern element  dennis.\n\nConclusionsHere we show that, in addition to factors with conserved expression profiles like homothorax, there are also a variety of transcription factors and signaling pathway components that appear to vary in their expression profiles between closely related butterfly species, highlighting the importance of genome-wide regulatory evolution between species.",

    "abstract": "The pathophysiology of osteoarthritis (OA) involves dysregulation of anabolic and catabolic processes associated with a broad panel of cytokines and other secreted proteins and ultimately lead to cartilage degradation. An increased understanding about the interactions of these proteins by means of systematic in vitro analyses may give new ideas regarding pharmaceutical candidates for treatment of OA and related cartilage degradation.\n\nTherefore, first an ex vivo tissue model of cartilage degradation was established by culturing full thickness tissue explants with bacterial collagenase II. Then responses of healthy and degrading cartilage were analyzed by measuring protein abundance in tissue supernatant with a 26-multiplex protein profiling assay, after exposing them to a panel of 55 protein stimulations present in synovial joints of OA patients. Multivariate data analysis including exhaustive pairwise variable subset selection was used to identify the most outstanding changes in the measured protein secretions. This revealed that the MMP9 response is outstandingly low in degraded compared to healthy cartilage and that there are several protein pairs like IFNG and MMP9 that can be used for successful discrimination between degraded and healthy samples.\n\nTaken together, the results show that the characteristic changes in protein responses discovered seem promising for accurate detection/diagnosis of degrading cartilage in general and OA in particular. More generally the employed ex vivo tissue model seems promising for drug discovery and development projects related to cartilage degradation, for example when trying to uncover the unknown interactions between secreted proteins in healthy and degraded tissues.",

    "abstract": "The effects of heavy metals on human health have become an important area of study. For instance, acute manganese toxicity is known to induce Parkinsonism. Heavy metals including manganese enter the aquatic environment from both anthropogenic and natural processes. These metals accumulate within water sediments and their behavior is then dependent upon the sediment composition and phase. These metal-sediment interactions remain to be explored within in-vivo animal studies. To study the effect of these interactions, herein we successfully developed an exposure model in mice that encapsulates the aquatic microenvironment of heavy metals before exposure. Male and female C57/BL6 mice were exposed to manganese contaminated sediment via their drinking water (Sed_Mn) or to manganese placed directly into their drinking water with no prior sediment interaction (Mn) for six weeks. Sediment interaction did not alter total manganese in drinking water (mg/L) or weekly manganese consumption (mg) in males (54.9{+/-}1.5 mg) or females (44.6{+/-}1.0 mg) over the six-week exposure period. We analyzed motor impairment, a common feature in Parkinsons disease, using the beam traversal, cylinder, and accelerating rotarod behavioral tests. We observed Parkinsons like deficits in motor control in both treatment groups as early as four weeks of exposure in males but not in females. Intriguingly, mice given water incubated with manganese spiked sediment (Sed_Mn) performed better overall compared to mice given manganese directly in water (Mn) despite having similar exposure in males and females. Male Sed_Mn mice compared to Mn mice had a 146% reduction in time to cross the beam traversal test (p<0.05), a 10% increase in rearing activity in the cylinder test (p<0.05), and a 14% increase in time remaining on the rotarod (not significant). Female Sed_Mn mice compared to Mn mice had no change in the time to cross the beam traversal test, a 36% increase in rearing activity in the cylinder test (p<0.05), and a 35% increase in time on the rotarod (p<0.05). Our study indicates that metal-sediment interactions may alter metal toxicity in mammals and introduces a new exposure model to test the toxicity of metal contaminants of drinking water.",

We previously proposed that the cerebellum controls the degree-of-freedoms during learning by gradually modulating the electric coupling strength between inferior olive neurons. Here, we develop a modeling technique to estimate effective coupling strengths between inferior olive neurons from in vivo recordings of Purkinje cell complex spike activity in three different coupling conditions. We show that high coupling strengths induce synchronous firing and decrease the dimensionality of inferior olive firing dynamics. In contrast, intermediate coupling strengths induce chaotic firing and increase the dimensionality of firing dynamics. Our results thus support the hypothesis that effective coupling controls the dimensionality of inferior olive firing, which may allow the olivocerebellar system to learn effectively from a small training sample set despite the low firing frequency of inferior olive neurons.",
