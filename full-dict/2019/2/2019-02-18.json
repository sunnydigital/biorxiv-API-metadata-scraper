    "abstract": "BackgroundAllele-specific copy number alteration (CNA) analysis is essential to study the functional impact of single nucleotide variants (SNV) and the process of tumorigenesis. Most commonly used tools in the field rely on high quality genome-wide data with matched normal profiles, limiting their applicability in clinical settings.\n\nMethodsWe propose a workflow, based on the open-source PureCN R/Bioconductor package in conjunction with widely used variant-calling and copy number segmentation algorithms, for allele-specific CNA analysis from whole exome sequencing (WES) without matched normals. We use The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ovarian carcinoma (OV) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) datasets to benchmark its performance against gold standard SNP6 microarray and WES datasets with matched normal samples. Our workflow further classifies SNVs by somatic status and then uses this information to infer somatic mutational signatures and tumor mutational burden (TMB).\n\nResultsApplication of our workflow to tumor-only WES data produces tumor purity and ploidy estimates that are highly concordant with estimates from SNP6 microarray data and matched-normal WES data. The presence of cancer type-specific somatic mutational signatures was inferred with high accuracy. We also demonstrate high concordance of TMB between our tumor-only workflow and matched normal pipelines.\n\nConclusionThe proposed workflow provides, to our knowledge, the only open-source option for comprehensive allele-specific CNA analysis and SNV classification of tumor-only WES with demonstrated high accuracy.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMale genitals have repeatedly evolved left-right asymmetries, and the causes of such evolution remain unclear. The Drosophila nannoptera group contains four species, among which three exhibit left-right asymmetries of distinct genital organs. In the most studied species, Drosophila pachea, males display asymmetric genital lobes and they mate right-sided on top of the female. Copulation position of the other species is unknown.\n\nResultsTo assess whether the evolution of genital asymmetry could be linked to the evolution of one-sided mating, we examined phallus morphology and copulation position in D. pachea and closely related species. The phallus was found to be symmetric in all investigated species except D. pachea, which display an asymmetric phallus with a right-sided gonopore, and D. acanthoptera, which harbor an asymmetrically bent phallus. In all examined species, males were found to position themselves symmetrically on top of the female, except in D. pachea and D. nannoptera, where males mated right-sided, in distinctive, species-specific positions. In addition, the copulation duration was found to be increased in nannoptera group species compared to closely related outgroup species.\n\nConclusionOur study shows that gains, and possibly losses, of asymmetry in genital morphology and mating position have evolved repeatedly in the nannoptera group. Current data does not allow us to conclude whether genital asymmetry has evolved in response to changes in mating position, or vice versa.",

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic climate change is an urgent threat to species diversity. One aspect of this threat is the collapse of species reproductive barriers through increased hybridization. The primary mechanism for this collapse is thought to be the weakening of ecologically-mediated reproductive barriers, as demonstrated in many cases of \"reverse speciation\" . Here, we expand on this idea and show that adaptive introgression between species adapting to a shared, moving climatic optimum can readily weaken any reproductive barrier, including those that are completely independent of the climatic variable. Using genetically explicit forward-time simulations, we show that genetic linkage between alleles conferring adaptation to a changing climate and alleles conferring reproductive isolation can lead to adaptive introgression facilitating the homogenization of reproductive isolation alleles. This effect causes the decay of species boundaries across a broad and biologically-realistic parameter space. We explore how the magnitude of this effect depends upon the rate of climate change, the genetic architecture of adaptation, the initial degree of reproductive isolation and the mutation rate. These results highlight a previously unexplored effect of rapid climate change on species diversity.",

    "abstract": "The divergence of duplicate genes links to organismic adaptation. In Arabidopsis thaliana two nuclear genes encode mitochondrial GrpEs, MGE1 and MGE2, the nucleotide exchange factors of DnaK/HSP70 chaperone. MGE1 and MGE2 are duplicate genes originated from a whole genome duplication event. They respond differentially to high temperature; MGE2 is heat-inducible and is required for Arabidopsis seedlings to tolerate prolonged heat stress, while MGE1 is constitutively expressed. Heterologous expression of MGE2 but not MGE1 restored the growth of E. coli grpE mutant cells at elevated temperatures, suggesting that MGE2 is more thermostable than MGE1. In this study, we directly compared the thermostability of the purified recombinant MGE1 and MGE2 by circular dichroism spectroscopy. The temperature midpoints of the unfolding transition (Tm) of MGE1 and MGE2 were about 38 and 46 {degrees}C, respectively, indicating that MGE2 is remarkably more stable than MGE1 at higher temperature. Domain swapping between the two homologous proteins showed that the N-terminal region, including an unstructured sequence and a long -helix domain, is the major determinant of the thermostability. Although MGE2 contains a conserved sequence derived from an exonized intron within the N-terminus unstructured region, deletion of this sequence did not substantially affect protein thermostability in vitro and complementation of E. coli and Arabidopsis heat sensitive mutants. Taken together, our results suggest that Arabidopsis MGE1 and MGE2 had diverged not only in transcriptional response but also in the thermostability of the encoded proteins, which may contribute to adaptation of plants to higher temperatures.",

    "abstract": "Using vaccine challenge model of T. gondii infection, we found that treatments with two commonly used for NK cell depletion antibodies resulted in different survival outcomes during secondary infection. Anti-ASGM1 resulted in 100% death and greater parasite burden at the site of infection than anti-NK1.1. Anti-NK1.1 treatment resulted in increased parasite burdens, but animals did not die. Further we found that anti-ASGM1 treatment depleted T cells. CD8+ T cells were more susceptible that CD4+ T cells to the treatment. ASGM1 was expressed on a higher percentage of CD8+ T cells than CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. In T. gondii-immunized animals ASGM1 was enriched on effector memory (Tem) and central memory (Tcm) CD8+ T cells. However, Tem were more susceptible to the treatment. After secondary infection, Tem, Tcm, effector (Tef) and naive (Tn) CD8+ T cells were positive for ASGM1. Anti-ASGM1 treatment during reinfection resulted in greater depletion of activated IFN{gamma}+, Granzyme B+, Tem and Tef than Tcm and Tn CD8+ T cells. Anti-ASGM1 also depleted IFN{gamma}+ CD4+ T cells. Recombinant IFN{gamma} supplementation prolonged survival of anti-ASGM1 treated mice, demonstrating that this antibody eliminated IFN{gamma}-producing T and NK cells important for control of the parasite. These results highlight that anti-ASGM1 antibody is not an optimal choice for targeting only NK cells and more precise approaches should be used. This study uncovers ASGM1 as a marker of activated effector T cells and the potential importance of changes in sialylation in lipid rafts for T cell activation during T. gondii infection.",

    "abstract": "The generation of neuronal diversity is essential for circuit formation and behavior. Morphological differences in sequentially born neurons could be due to intrinsic molecular identity specified by temporal transcription factors (henceforth called intrinsic temporal identity) or due to changing extrinsic cues. Here we use the Drosophila NB7-1 lineage to address this question. NB7-1 sequentially generates the U1-U5 motor neurons; each has a distinct intrinsic temporal identity due to inheritance of a different temporal transcription factor at time of birth. Here we show that the U1-U5 neurons project axons sequentially, followed by sequential dendrite extension. We misexpress the earliest temporal transcription factor, Hunchback, to create \"ectopic\" U1 neurons with an early intrinsic temporal identity but later birth-order. These ectopic U1 neurons have axon muscle targeting and dendrite neuropil targeting consistent with U1 intrinsic temporal identity, rather than their time of birth or differentiation. We conclude that intrinsic temporal identity plays a major role in establishing both motor axon muscle targeting and dendritic arbor targeting, which are required for proper motor circuit development.",

    "abstract": "Males and females feature strikingly different phenotypes, despite sharing most of their genome. The resolution of this apparent paradox is through differential gene expression, whereby genes are expressed at different levels in each sex. This resolution, however, is likely to be incomplete, leading to conflict between males and females over the optimal expression of genes. We test the hypothesis that gene expression in females is constrained from evolving to its optimum level due to sexually antagonistic selection on males, by examining changes sex-biased gene expression in five obligate asexual species of stick insect, which do not produce males. We predicted that the transcriptome of asexual females would be feminized as asexual females do not experience any sexual conflict. Contrary to our prediction we find that asexual females feature masculinized gene expression, and hypothesise that this is due to shifts in female optimal gene expression levels following the suppression of sex.",

Here we inactivate E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) by introducing D27G,N,F chromosomal mutations in a key catalytic residue with subsequent adaptation by serial dilutions. The partial reversal G27->C occurred in three evolutionary trajectories. Conversely, in one trajectory for D27G and in all trajectories for D27F,N strains adapted to grow at very low supplement folAmix concentrations but did not escape entirely from supplement auxotrophy. Major global shifts in metabolome and proteome occurred upon DHFR inactivation, which were partially reversed in adapted strains. Loss of function mutations in two genes, thyA and deoB, ensured adaptation to low folAmix by rerouting the 2-Deoxy-D-ribose-phosphate metabolism from glycolysis towards synthesis of dTMP. Multiple evolutionary pathways of adaptation to low folAmix converge to highly accessible yet suboptimal fitness peak.",

Among many tissues and species, the mammalian brain is the organ in which circRNAs are more abundant and first evidence of their functional significance started to emerge. Yet, even within this well studied organ, annotation of circRNAs remains fragmentary, their sequence is unknown and their expression in specific cell types was never investigated. Overcoming these limitations, here we provide the fist comprehensive identification of circRNAs and their expression patterns in proliferating neural stem cells, neurogenic progenitors and newborn neurons of the developing mouse cortex. Extending the current knowledge about the diversity of this class of transcripts by the identification of nearly 4,000 new circRNAs, our study is the first to provide the full sequence information and expression patterns of circRNAs in cell types representing the lineage of neurogenic commitment. We further exploited our data by evaluating the coding potential, evolutionary conservation and biogenesis of circRNAs that we found to arise from a specific sub-class of linear mRNAs. Our study provides the arising field of circRNA biology with a powerful new resource to address the complexity and potential biological significance of this new class of transcripts.",

    "abstract": "The Bothnian Sea is an oligotrophic brackish basin characterized by low salinity and high concentrations of reactive iron, methane and ammonium in the sediments potentially enabling an intricate microbial network. Therefore, we analyzed and compared biogeochemical and microbial profiles at one offshore and two near coastal sites in the Bothnian Sea. 16S rRNA amplicon sequence analysis revealed stratification of both bacterial and archaeal taxa in accordance with the geochemical gradients of iron, sulfate and methane. The communities at the two near coastal sites were more similar to each other than that at the offshore site located at a greater water depth. To obtain insights into the metabolic networks within the iron-rich methanic sediment layer located below the sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ), we performed metagenomic sequencing of sediment-derived DNA. Genome bins retrieved from the most abundant bacterial and archaeal community members revealed a broad potential for respiratory sulfur metabolism via partially reduced sulfur species. Nitrogen cycling was dominated by reductive processes via a truncated denitrification pathway encoded exclusively by bacterial lineages. Gene-centric fermentative metabolism analysis indicated the central role of acetate, formate, alcohols and hydrogen in the analyzed anaerobic sediment. Methanogenic/-trophic pathways were dominated by Methanosaetaceae, Methanosarcinaceae, Methanomassiliicoccaceae, Methanoregulaceae and ANME-2 archaea. Thorarchaeota and Bathyarchaeota encoded pathways for acetogenesis. Our results indicate flexible metabolic capabilities of core community bacterial and archaeal taxa, which can adapt to changing redox conditions, and with a spatial distribution in Bothnian Sea sediments that is likely governed by the quality of available organic substrates.",

    "abstract": "Monosynaptic tracing using rabies virus is an important technique in neuroscience, allowing brain- wide labeling of neurons directly presynaptic to a targeted neuronal population. A 2017 article reported development of a noncytotoxic version - a major advance - based on attenuating the rabies virus by addition of a destabilization domain to the C-terminus of a viral protein. However, this modification did not appear to hinder the ability of the virus to spread between neurons. We analyzed two viruses provided by the authors and show here that both were mutants that had lost the intended modification, explaining the papers paradoxical results. We then made a virus that actually did have the intended modification in at least the majority of virions and found that it did not spread efficiently under the conditions described in the original paper, namely, without an exogenous protease being expressed in order to remove the destabilization domain. We found that it did spread when the protease was supplied, although this also appeared to result in the deaths of most source cells by three weeks postinjection. We conclude that the new approach is not robust but that it could become a viable technique given further optimization and validation.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTRabies virus, which spreads between synaptically-connected neurons, has been one of the primary tools used by neuroscientists to reveal the organization of the brain. A new modification to rabies virus was recently reported to allow the mapping of connected neurons without adverse effects on the cells health, unlike earlier versions. Here we show that the conclusions of that study were probably incorrect and based on having used viruses that had lost the intended modification because of mutations. We also show that a rabies virus that does retain the intended modification does not spread efficiently between neurons under the conditions reported previously; however, it does spread between neurons under different conditions, suggesting that the approach may be successful if refined further.",

The cytoskeleton plays important roles in all of these cellular processes, but to date, the filamentous actin network within Chlamydomonas has remained elusive. By optimizing labeling conditions, we can now visualize distinct linear actin filaments at the posterior of the nucleus in both live and fixed vegetative cells. Using in situ cryo-electron tomography, we confirmed this localization by directly imaging actin filaments within the native cellular environment. The fluorescently-labeled structures are sensitive to the depolymerizing agent Latrunculin B (Lat B), demonstrating the specificity of our optimized labeling method. Interestingly, Lat B treatment resulted in the formation of a transient ring-like filamentous actin structure around the nucleus. The assembly of this perinuclear ring is dependent upon a second actin isoform, NAP1, which is strongly upregulated upon Lat B treatment and is insensitive to Lat B-induced depolymerization. Our study combines orthogonal strategies to provide the first detailed visual characterization of filamentous actins in Chlamydomonas, allowing insights into the coordinated functions of two actin isoforms expressed within the same cell.",

This protective redundancy partly relies on the fact that paralogs carry their functions independently, i.e. the inactivation of one gene copy does not impair the function of the other copy. However, a significant fraction of paralogous proteins may form functionally dependent pairs, for instance through heteromerization. As a consequence, one could expect these heteromeric paralogs to be less protective against deleterious mutations. To test this hypothesis, we examined the fitness landscape of gene loss-of-function by CRISPR-Cas9 in more than 450 human cell lines. Our analysis revealed a robustness landscape of human cells showing regions of higher vulnerability to gene inactivation as a function of key paralog properties. We find that heteromerizing paralogs are indeed less protective than non-heteromeric ones, but this association is largely due to their higher abundance and their larger number of protein-protein interaction partners.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal activity is responsible for large energy consumption within the brain. However, the cellular mechanisms draining ATP upon the arrival of a stimulus are yet to be explored systematically at the post-synapse. Here we provide evidence that a significant fraction of ATP is consumed upon glutamate stimulation to energize the mGluR-induced protein synthesis. We find that both mGluR and NMDAR alter protein synthesis and ATP consumption with distinct kinetics at the synaptic-dendritic compartments. While mGluR activation leads to a rapid and sustained reduction in the neuronal ATP level, NMDAR activation has no immediate impact on the same. ATP consumption correlates inversely to the kinetics of protein synthesis for both the receptors. We observe a persistent elevation in protein synthesis within 5 minutes of mGluR activation and robust inhibition of the same within 2 minutes of NMDAR activation, assessed by the phosphorylation status of eEF2 and metabolic labeling. However, a delayed protein synthesis-dependent ATP expenditure ensues after 15 minutes of NMDAR activation. We identify a central role for AMPK in this correlation between protein synthesis and ATP consumption. AMPK is dephosphorylated and inhibited upon mGluR activation while it was rapidly phosphorylated upon NMDAR activation. Perturbing AMPK activity disrupts the receptor-specific modulations of eEF2 phosphorylation and protein synthesis. Therefore, our observations suggest that the glutamate receptors required modulating the AMPK-eEF2 signaling axis to alter neuronal protein synthesis and bioenergetics.\n\nShort SummaryStimulation of glutamate receptors induces robust protein synthesis within cortical neurons and consumes a significantly large fraction of cellular ATP. Glutamate receptors viz. mGlulR and NMDAR modulate AMPK-eEF2 signaling uniquely leading to the dynamic regulation of protein synthesis and bioenergetics.\n\nKey HighlightsO_LIProtein synthesis following glutamate receptor activation is responsible for the bulk of the activity-induced ATP consumption in cortical neurons.\nC_LIO_LImGluR and NMDAR regulate protein synthesis with distinct kinetics and dictate the subsequent impacts over neuronal ATP level.\nC_LIO_LIDynamic modulation of AMPK and eEF2 phosphorylation is key to create unique temporal features of receptor-specific protein synthesis and bioenergetics.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Polymerizing and filament-forming proteins are instrumental for numerous cellular processes such as cell division and growth. Their function in stabilization and localization of protein complexes and replicons is achieved by a filamentous structure. Known filamentous proteins assemble into homopolymers consisting of single subunits - e.g. MreB and FtsZ in bacteria - or heteropolymers that are composed of two subunits, e.g. keratin and /{beta} tubulin in eukaryotes. Here, we describe two novel coiled-coil-rich proteins (CCRPs) in the filament forming cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 (hereafter Anabaena) that assemble into a heteropolymer and function in the maintenance of the Anabaena multicellular shape (termed trichome). The two CCRPs - Alr4504 and Alr4505 (named ZicK and ZacK) - are strictly interdependent for the assembly of protein filaments in vivo and polymerize nucleotide-independently in vitro, similar to known intermediate filament (IF) proteins. A {Delta}zicK{Delta}zacK double mutant is characterized by a zigzagged cell arrangement and hence a loss of the typical linear Anabaena trichome shape. ZicK and ZacK interact with themselves, with each other, with the elongasome protein MreB, the septal junction protein SepJ and the divisome associate septal protein SepI. Our results suggest that ZicK and ZacK function in cooperation with SepJ and MreB to stabilize the Anabaena trichome and are likely essential for the manifestation of the multicellular shape in Anabaena. Our study reveals the presence of filament-forming IF-like proteins whose function is achieved through the formation of heteropolymers in cyanobacteria.",

Accurate identification of TUs is a crucial first step to delineate the transcriptional regulatory networks and elucidate the dynamic regulatory mechanisms encoded in various prokaryotic genomes. Many genomic features, e.g., gene intergenic distance, and transcriptomic features including continuous and stable RNA-seq reads count signals, have been collected from a large amount of experimental data and integrated into classification techniques to computationally predict genome-wide TUs. Although some tools and web servers are able to predict TUs based on bacterial RNA-seq data and genome sequences, there is a need to have an improved machine-learning prediction approach and a better comprehensive pipeline handling QC, TU prediction, and TU visualization. To enable users to efficiently perform TU identification on their local computers or high-performance clusters and provide a more accurate prediction, we develop an R package, named rSeqTU. rSeqTU uses a random forest algorithm to select essential features describing TUs and then uses support vector machine (SVM) to build TU prediction models. rSeqTU (available at https://s18692001.github.io/rSeqTU/) has six computational functionalities including read quality control, read mapping, training set generation, random-forest-based feature selection, TU prediction, and TU visualization.",

    "abstract": "Opsins form a family of light-activated, retinal-dependent G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that serve a multitude of visual and non-visual functions. Opsin3 (OPN3 or encephalopsin), initially identified in the brain, remains one of the few members of the mammalian opsin family with unknown function and ambiguous light-absorption properties. We recently discovered that OPN3 is highly expressed in human epidermal melanocytes--the skin cells that produce melanin. The melanin pigment is a critical defense against ultraviolet radiation and its production is mediated by the Gs-coupled melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R). The physiological function and light-sensitivity of OPN3 in melanocytes is yet to be determined. Here we show that in human epidermal melanocytes OPN3 acts as a negative regulator of melanin production by interacting with MC1R and modulating its cAMP signaling. OPN3 negatively regulates the cAMP response evoked by MC1R via activation of the Gi subunit of G-proteins, thus decreasing cellular melanin levels. In addition to their functional relationship, OPN3 and MC1R colocalize at both the plasma membrane and in intracellular structures and form a physical complex. Remarkably, OPN3 can bind retinal, but does not mediate light-induced signaling in melanocytes. Our results identify a novel function for OPN3 in the regulation of the melanogenic pathway in epidermal melanocytes. Our results reveal a light-independent function for the poorly characterized OPN3 and a novel pathway that greatly expands our understanding of melanocyte and skin physiology.\n\nSignificanceOur data reveals a novel function for the non-visual opsin OPN3 in regulating the pigmentation of human melanocytes by interacting with and modulating the activity of MC1R.",

    "abstract": "Tumor mutation burden (TMB) is a quantitative measurement of how many mutations present in tumor cells from a patient tumor as assessed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. High TMB is used as a predictive biomarker to select patients that likely respond to immunotherapy in many cancer types, thus it is critical to accurately measure TMB for cancer patients who need to receive the immunotherapy. Recent studies showed that image features from histopathology whole slide images can be used to predict genetic features (e.g., mutation status) or clinical outcome of cancer patients. In this study, we develop a computational method to predict the TMB level from cancer patients histopathology whole slide images. The prediction problem is formulated as multiple instance learning (MIL) because a whole slide image (a bag) has to be divided into multiple image blocks (instances) due to computational reasons but a single label is available only to an entire whole slide image not to each image block. In particular, we propose a novel heteroscedastic noise model for MIL based on the framework of Gaussian process (GP), where the noise variance is assumed to be a latent function of image level features. This noise variance can encode the confidence in predicting the TMB level from each training image and make the method to put different levels of effort to classify images according to how difficult each image can be correctly classified. The method tries to fit an easier image well while it does not put much effort in classifying a harder (ambiguous) image correctly. Expectation and propagation (EP) is employed to efficiently infer our model and to find the optimal hyper-parameters. We have demonstrated from synthetic and real-world data sets that our method outperforms on TMB prediction from whole slide images base-line methods, including a special case of our method that does not include the heteroscedastic noise modeling and multiple instance ordinal regression (MIOR) that is one of few algorithms to solve ordinal regression in the MIL setting.",

    "abstract": "The human body is made up of hundreds, perhaps thousands of cell types and states, most of which are currently inaccessible genetically. Genetic accessibility carries significant diagnostic and therapeutic potential by allowing the selective delivery of genetic messages or cures to cells. Research in model organisms has shown that single regulatory element (RE) activities are seldom cell type specific, limiting their usage in genetic systems designed to restrict gene expression posteriorly to their delivery to cells. Intersectional genetic approaches can increase the number of genetically accessible cells. A typical intersectional method acts like an AND logic gate by converting the input of two or more active REs into a single synthetic output, which becomes unique for that cell. Here, we systematically assessed the intersectional genetics landscape of human using a curated subset of cells from a large RE usage atlas obtained by Cap Analysis of Gene Expression Sequencing (CAGE-Seq) of thousands of primary and cancer cells (the FANTOM5 consortium atlas). We developed the heuristics and algorithms to retrieve and quality rank AND gate intersections intra- and inter-individually. We find that >90% of the 154 primary cell types surveyed can be distinguished from each other with as little as 3 to 4 active REs, with quantifiable safety and robustness. We call these minimal intersections of active REs with cell-type diagnostic potential \"Versatile Entry Codes\" (VEnCodes). We show that VEnCodes could be found for 100% of the 158 cancer cell types surveyed, and that most of these are highly robust to intra- and interindividual variation. Our tools for generating and quality-ranking VEnCodes can be adapted to other RE usage databases and to other intersectional methods using alternative Boolean logic operations. Our work demonstrate the potential of intersectional approaches for future gene delivery technologies in human.",

    "abstract": "Metabolically quiescent pathogens can persist in a viable non-replicating state for months or even years. For certain infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, latent infection is a corollary of this dormant state, which has the risk for reactivation and clinical disease. During murine cryptococcosis and macrophage uptake, stress and host immunity induce C. neoformans heterogeneity with the generation of a sub-population of yeasts that manifests a phenotype compatible with dormancy (low stress response, latency of growth). In this subpopulation, mitochondrial transcriptional activity is regulated and this phenotype has been considered as a hallmark of quiescence in stem cells. Based on these findings, we worked to reproduce this phenotype in vitro and then standardize the experimental conditions to consistently generate this dormancy in Cryptococcus neoformans.\n\nWe found that incubation of stationary phase yeasts (STAT) in nutriment limited conditions and hypoxia for 8 days (8D-HYPOx) was able to produced cells that mimic the phenotype obtained in vivo. In these conditions, mortality and/or apoptosis occurred in less than 5% of the yeasts compared to 30-40% of apoptotic or dead yeasts upon incubation in normoxia (8D-NORMOx). Yeasts in 8D-HYPOx harbored a lower stress response, delayed growth and less that 1% of culturability on agar plates, suggesting that these yeasts are viable but non culturable cells (VBNC). These VBNC were able to reactivate in the presence of pantothenic acid, a vitamin that is known to be involved in quorum sensing and a precursor of acetyl-CoA. Global metabolism of 8D-HYPOx cells showed some specific requirements and was globally shut down compared to 8D-NORMOx and STAT conditions. Mitochondrial analyses showed that the mitochondrial masse increased with mitochondria mostly depolarized in 8D-HYPOx compared to 8D-NORMox, with increased expression of mitochondrial genes. Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses of 8D-HYPOx revealed that the number of secreted proteins and transcripts detected also decreased compared to 8D-NORMOx and STAT, and the proteome, secretome and transcriptome harbored specific profiles that are engaged as soon as four days of incubation. Importantly, acetyl-CoA and the fatty acid pathway involving mitochondria are required for the generation and viability maintenance of VBNC.\n\nAll together, these data show that we were able to generate for the first time VBNC phenotype in Cryptococcocus neoformans. This VBNC state is associated with a specific metabolism that should be further studied to understand dormancy/quiescence in this yeast.",

We generated genetically encoded pH sensors to determine absolute pH changes across the plasma membrane in response to biotic stress. A rapid apoplastic acidification by phosphorylation-based proton pump activation was followed by an acidification of the cortical side of the plasma membrane in response to the fungus Fusarium oxysporum. The proton chemical gradient modulation immediately reduced cellulose synthesis and cell growth and, furthermore, had a direct influence on the pathogenicity of the fungus. All these effects were dependent on the COMPANION OF CELLULOSE SYNTHASE proteins that are thus at the nexus of plant growth and defense.

    "abstract": "Species do not function as isolated entities, rather they are organized in complex networks of interactions. These networks develop the ecological processes that provide ecosystem services for human societies. Understanding the causes and consequences of changes in ecological networks due to landscape modification would allow us to understand the consequences of ecological processes. However, there is still theoretical controversy and few empirical data on the effects of network characteristics on the loss of natural environments. We investigate how bat-fruit networks respond to three landscapes representing the gradient of modification from pre-montane forest to a heterogeneous agricultural landscape in the Colombian Andes (continuous forests, forest fragments, and crops). We found that forest contained smaller bat-fruit networks than forest fragments and crops. Modified landscapes had similar ecological network structures to forest (nestedness and modularity), but crops contained less specialized networks compared to forests and fragments and the species role in these habitats change. The networks in the rural coffee landscape maintain their structure in the different transformation scenarios, indicating that seed dispersal services are maintained even in the most transformed scenarios. This could be related to the high heterogeneity present in this rural landscape. Although the number of species does not decrease due to transformations, species change their roles in the most transformed habitats. This result sheds light on the way that biodiversity responds to anthropogenic transformations, showing higher stability than theoretically predicted.",

Dpy30 inactivation results in deficiency in global H3K4 methylation, and disrupts development of hippocampus and especially the dentate gyrus and subventricular zone, the major regions for postnatal NSC activities. By in vitro assays on neurospheres from mouse brains as well as human and mouse NPCs, we show that Dpy30 is indispensable for sustaining the self-renewal and proliferation of NSPCs in a cell-intrinsic manner, and also enables the differentiation of mouse and human NPCs to neuronal and glial lineages. Dpy30 directly regulates H3K4 methylation and the induction of several genes critical in neurogenesis. These findings link a prominent epigenetic mechanism of gene expression to the fundamental properties of NSPCs, and may have implications in neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTAs a highly prominent epigenetic mark that is associated with gene activation and a number of neurodevelopmental disorders in human, the role of histone H3K4 methylation in the fate determination of neural stem cells is unclear. Result of this study uncover a profound role of this epigenetic modification in the fundamental properties of postnatal neural stem cells, including self-renewal and differentiation, and may have implications for a better understanding and treatment of a broad spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with H3K4 methylation modulators.",
