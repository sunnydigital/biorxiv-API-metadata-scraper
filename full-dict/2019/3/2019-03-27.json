    "abstract": "Adipose regulatory T cells (aTregs) have emerged as critical cells for the control of local and systemic inflammation. In this study, we show a distinctive role for the transcriptional regulator Id2 in the differentiation, survival and function of aTregs. Id2 was highly expressed in aTregs compared with high Id3 expression in lymphoid Tregs. Treg-specific deletion of Id2 resulted in a substantial decrease in aTregs, while Tregs in the spleen and lymph nodes were unaffected. Additionally, loss of Id2 resulted in decreased expression of aTreg associated markers including ST2, CCR2, KLRG1 and GATA3. Gene expression analysis revealed that Id2 expression was essential for the survival of aTregs and loss of Id2 increased cell death in aTregs due to increased Fas expression. Id2-mediated aTreg depletion resulted in increased systemic inflammation, increased inflammatory macrophages and CD8+ effector T cells and loss of glucose tolerance under standard diet conditions. Thus, we reveal an unexpected and novel function for Id2 in mediating differentiation, survival and function of adipose-resident Tregs, that when lost resulting in increased metabolic perturbation.",

    "abstract": "Resisting or tolerating microbes are alternative strategies to survive infection, but little is known about the evolutionary mechanisms controlling this balance. Here, genomic analyses of anatomically modern humans, extinct Denisovan hominins, and mice revealed a series of missense variants in the immune response inhibitor A20 (encoded by TNFAIP3), substituting non-catalytic residues of the ubiquitin protease domain to diminish I{kappa}B-dependent phosphorylation and activation of A20. Two A20 variants with partial phosphorylation deficits appeared beneficial: one originating in Denisovans and introgressed in modern humans throughout Oceania, and another in a mouse strain resistant to Coxsackievirus. By contrast, a variant with 95% loss of phosphorylation caused spontaneous inflammatory disease in humans and mice. Analysis of the partial phosphorylation variant in mice revealed diminished tolerance of bacterial lipopolysaccharide or to poxvirus inoculation as trade-offs for enhanced immunity.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryModern and ancient variants reveal a genetically tunable element for balancing immunity and microbial tolerance.",

    "abstract": "The D1 switch is a packing motif, broadly distributed in the proteome, that couples tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) domain movement to catalysis and specificity, thereby creating an escapement mechanism essential to free-energy transduction. The escapement mechanism arose from analysis of an extensive set of combinatorial mutations to this motif, which allowed us to relate mutant-induced changes quantitatively to both kinetic and computational parameters during catalysis. To further characterize the origins of this escapement mechanism in differential TrpRS conformational stabilities, we use high-throughput Thermofluor measurements for the 16 variants to extend analysis of the mutated residues to their impact on unliganded TrpRS stability. Aggregation of denatured proteins complicates thermodynamic interpretations of denaturation experiments. The free energy landscape of a liganded TrpRS complex, carried out for different purposes, closely matches the volume, helix content, and transition temperatures of Thermoflour and CD melting profiles. Regression analysis using the combinatorial design matrix accounts for >90% of the variance in Tms of both Thermofluor and CD melting profiles. We argue that the agreement of experimental melting temperatures with both computational free energy landscape and with Regression modeling means that experimental melting profiles can be used to analyze the thermodynamic impact of combinatorial mutations. Tertiary packing and aromatic stacking of Phenylalanine 37 exerts a dominant stabilizing effect on both native and molten globular states. The TrpRS Urzyme structure remains essentially intact at the highest temperatures explored by the simulations.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic lethal screens have the potential to identify new vulnerabilities incurred by specific cancer mutations but have been hindered by lack of agreement between studies. Using KRAS as a model, we identified that published synthetic lethal screens significantly overlap at the pathway rather than gene level. Analysis of pathways encoded as protein networks identified synthetic lethal candidates that were more reproducible than those previously reported. Lack of overlap likely stems from biological rather than technical limitations as most synthetic lethal phenotypes were strongly modulated by changes in cellular conditions or genetic context, the latter determined using a pairwise genetic interaction map that identified numerous interactions that suppress synthetic lethal effects. Accounting for pathway, cellular and genetic context nominates a DNA repair dependency in KRAS-mutant cells, mediated by a network containing BRCA1. We provide evidence for why most reported synthetic lethals are not reproducible which is addressable using a multi-faceted testing framework.\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCESynthetic lethal screens have the power to identify new targets in cancer, although have thus far come up short of expectation. We use computational and experimental approaches to delineate principles for identifying robust synthetic lethal targets that could aid in the development of effective new therapeutic strategies for genetically defined cancers.",

TIGIT was also upregulated in peripheral lymphocytes in GBM, suggesting recirculation of TILs.

    "abstract": "1.Correlative imaging combines information from multiple modalities (physical-chemical-mechanical properties) at various length-scales (cm to nm) to understand complex biological materials across dimensions (2D-3D). Here, we have used numerous coupled systems: X-ray microscopy (XRM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), optical light microscopy (LM), and focused-ion beam (FIB-SEM) microscopy to ascertain the microstructural and crystallographic properties of the wall-plate joints in the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides. The exoskeleton is composed of six interlocking wall-plates, and the interlocks between neighbouring plates (alae) allow barnacles to expand and grow whilst remaining sealed and structurally strong. Our results indicate that the ala contain functionally-graded orientations and microstructures in their crystallography, which has implications for naturally functioning microstructures, potential natural strengthening, and preferred oriented biomineralisation. Elongated grains at the outer edge of the ala are oriented perpendicularly to the contact surface, and the c-axis rotates with the radius of the ala. Additionally, we identify for the first time three-dimensional nano-scale ala pore networks revealing that the pores are only visible at the tip of the ala, and that pore thickening occurs on the inside (soft-bodied) edge of the plates. The pore networks appear to have the same orientation as the oriented crystallography, and we deduce that the pore networks are probably organic channels and pockets which are involved with the biomineralisation process. Understanding these multi-scale features contributes towards an understanding of the structural architecture in barnacles, but also their consideration for bioinspiration of human-made materials. The work demonstrates that correlative methods spanning different length-scales, dimensions and modes enable the extension of structure-property relationships in materials to form and function of organisms.",

    "abstract": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) imports ATP and uses energy from ATP hydrolysis for protein folding and trafficking. However, little is known about this vital ATP transport process across the ER membrane. Here, using three commonly used cell lines (CHO, INS1 and HeLa), we report that ATP enters the ER lumen through a cytosolic Ca2+-antagonized mechanism, or CaATiER (Ca2+-Antagonized Transport into ER) mechanism for brevity. Significantly, we observed that a Ca2+ gradient across the ER membrane is necessary for ATP transport into the ER. Therefore Ca2+ signaling in the cytosol is inevitably coupled with ATP supply to the ER. We propose that under physiological conditions, cytosolic Ca2+ inhibits ATP import into the ER lumen to limit ER ATP consumption. Furthermore, the ATP level in the ER is readily depleted by oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) inhibitors, and that ER protein misfolding increases ATP trafficking from mitochondria into the ER. These findings suggest that ATP usage in the ER may increase mitochondrial OxPhos while decreasing glycolysis, i.e., an \\\"anti-Warburg\\\" effect.\\n\\nSignificance StatementWe report that ATP enters the ER lumen through an AXER-dependent, cytosolic Ca2+-antagonized mechanism, or CaATiER (Ca2+-Antagonized Transport into ER) mechanism.

    "abstract": "The periodic process of cell replication by division, known as cell-cycle, is a natural phenomenon occurring asynchronously in any cell population. Here, we consider the problem of synchronising cell-cycles across a population of yeast cells grown in a microfluidics device. Cells were engineered to reset their cell-cycle in response to low methionine levels. Automated syringes enable changing methionine levels (control input) in the microfluidics device. However, the control input resets only those cells that are in a specific phase of the cell-cycle (G1 phase), while the others continue to cycle unperturbed. We devised a simplified dynamical model of the cell-cycle, inferred its parameters from experimental data and then designed two control strategies: (i) an open-loop controller based on the application of periodic stimuli; (ii) a closed-loop model predictive controller (MPC) that selects the sequence of control stimuli which maximises a synchronisation index. Both the proposed control strategies were validated in-silico, together with experimental validation of the open-loop strategy.",

    "abstract": "Microbes adapt their metabolism to take advantage of nutrients in their environment. Such adaptations control specific metabolic pathways to match energetic demands with nutrient availability. Upon depletion of nutrients, rapid pathway recovery is key to release cellular resources required for survival in the new nutritional condition. Yet little is known about the regulatory strategies that microbes employ to accelerate pathway recovery in response to nutrient depletion. Using the fatty acid catabolic pathway in Escherichia coli, here we show that fast recovery can be achieved by rapid release of a transcriptional regulator from a metabolite-sequestered complex. With a combination of mathematical modelling and experiments, we show that recovery dynamics depend critically on the rate of metabolite consumption and the exposure time to nutrient. We constructed strains with re-wired transcriptional regulatory architectures that highlight the metabolic benefits of negative autoregulation over constitutive and positive autoregulation. Our results have wide-ranging implications for our understanding of metabolic adaptations, as well as guiding the design of gene circuitry for synthetic biology and metabolic engineering.",
