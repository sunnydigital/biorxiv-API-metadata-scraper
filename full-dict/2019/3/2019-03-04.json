    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry coupled with chromatography separation techniques provides a powerful platform for untargeted metabolomics. Determining the chemical identities of detected compounds however remains a major challenge. Here, we present a novel computational workflow, termed Expanded Metabolic Model Annotation (EMMA), that aims to strike a balance between discovering previously uncharacterized metabolites and the computational burden of annotation. EMMA engineers a candidate set, a listing of putative chemical identities to be used during annotation, through an expanded metabolic model (EMM). An EMM includes not only canonical substrates and products of enzymes already cataloged in a database through a reference metabolic model, but also metabolites that can form due to substrate promiscuity. EMMA was applied to untargeted LC-MS data collected from cultures of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and murine cecal microbiota. EMM metabolites matched, on average, to 23.92% of measured masses, providing a > 7-fold increase in the candidate set size when compared to a reference metabolic model. Many metabolites suggested by EMMA are not catalogued in PubChem. For the CHO cell, we experimentally confirmed the presence of 4-hydroxy-phenyllactate, a metabolite predicted by EMMA that has not been previously identified as part of CHO cell metabolism.",

    "abstract": "MotivationLarge scale catalogs of common genetic variants (including indels and structural variants) are being created using data from second and third generation whole-genome sequencing technologies. However, the genotyping of these variants in newly sequenced samples is a nontrivial task that requires extensive computational resources. Furthermore, current approaches are mostly limited to only specific types of variants and are generally prone to various errors and ambiguities when genotyping events in repeat regions. Thus we are proposing an ultra-efficient approach for genotyping any type of structural variation that is not limited by the shortcomings and complexities of current mapping-based approaches.\\n\\nResultsOur method Nebula utilizes the changes in the count of k-mers to predict the genotype of common structural variations. We have shown that not only Nebula is an order of magnitude faster than mapping based approaches for genotyping deletions and mobile-element insertions, but also has comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, Nebula is a generic framework not limited to any specific type of event.\\n\\nAvailabilityNebula is publicly available at https://github.com/Parsoa/NebulousSerendipity",

Time-resolved structural biology provides a means to visualise, at near-atomic resolution, the dynamic conformational changes that macromolecules undergo as they function. Recent advances in the resolution obtainable by electron microscopy (EM) and the broad range of samples that can be studied makes it ideally suited to time-resolved studies. Here we describe a cryo-electron microscopy grid preparation device that permits rapid mixing, voltage assisted spraying, and vitrification of samples. We show that the device produces grids of sufficient ice quality to enable data collection from single grids that results in a sub 4 [A] reconstruction. Rapid mixing can be achieved by blot and spray or mix and spray approaches with a delay of ~10 ms, providing greater temporal resolution than previously reported approaches.",

    "abstract": "-catenin is a key protein of adherens junctions (AJs) with mechanosensory properties. It also acts as a tumor suppressor that limits tissue growth. Here we analyzed the function of Drosophila -Catenin (-Cat) in growth regulation of the wing epithelium. We found that different -Cat levels led to a differential activation of Hippo/Yorkie or JNK signaling causing tissue overgrowth or degeneration, respectively. -Cat can modulate Yorkie-dependent tissue growth through recruitment of Ajuba, a negative regulator of Hippo signaling, to AJs but also through a mechanism that does not involve junctional recruitment of Ajuba. Further, both mechanosensory regions of -Cat, the M region and the actin-binding domain (ABD), contribute to growth regulation. Whereas M is dispensable for -Cat function in the wing, individual M domains (M1, M2, M3) have opposing effects on growth regulation. In particular, M1 limits Ajuba recruitment. Loss of M1 cause Ajuba hyper-recruitment to AJs promoting tissue-tension independent overgrowth. Although M1 binds Vinculin, Vinculin it is not responsible for this effect. Moreover, disruption of mechanosensing of the -Cat actin-binding domain affects tissue growth, with enhanced actin interactions stabilizing junctions and leading to tissue overgrowth. Together, our findings indicate that -Cat acts through multiple mechanisms to control tissue growth, including regulation of AJ stability, mechanosensitive Ajuba recruitment, and dynamic direct F-actin interactions.",

However, the degree to which variation in collective behavior is heritable and has fitness consequences -- the two prerequisites for evolution by natural selection -- is largely unknown. We used a new pharaoh ant (Monomorium pharaonis) mapping population to estimate the heritability, genetic correlations, and fitness consequences of three collective behaviors (foraging, aggression, and exploration) as well as body size, sex ratio, and caste ratio. Heritability estimates for the collective behaviors were moderate, ranging from 0.17 to 0.32, but lower than our estimates for the heritability of caste ratio, sex ratio, and the body size of new workers, queens, and males. Moreover, variation among colonies in collective behaviors was phenotypically correlated, suggesting that selection may shape multiple colony collective behaviors simultaneously. Finally, we found evidence for directional selection that was similar in strength to estimates of selection in natural populations. Altogether, our study begins to elucidate the genetic architecture of collective behavior and is one of the first studies to demonstrate that it is shaped by selection.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria of the Firmicutes phylum are able to enter a developmental pathway that culminates with the formation of a highly resistant, dormant spore. Spores allow environmental persistence, dissemination and for pathogens, are infection vehicles. In both the model Bacillus subtilis, an aerobic species, and in the intestinal pathogen Clostridioides difficile, an obligate anaerobe, sporulation mobilizes hundreds of genes. Their expression is coordinated between the forespore and the mother cell, the two cells that participate in the process, and is kept in close register with the course of morphogenesis. The evolutionary mechanisms by which sporulation emerged and evolved in these two species, and more broadly across Firmicutes, remain largely unknown. Here, we trace the origin and evolution of sporulation. Using the genes involved in the process in B. subtilis and C. difficile, and estimating their gain-loss dynamics in a comprehensive bacterial macro-evolutionary framework we show that sporulation evolution was driven by two major gene gain events, the first at the base of the Firmicutes and the second at the base of the B. subtilis group and within the Peptostreptococcaceae family, which includes C. difficile. We also show that early and late sporulation regulons have been co-evolving and that sporulation genes entail greater innovation in B. subtilis with many Bacilli-lineage restricted genes. In contrast, C. difficile more often recruits new sporulation genes by horizontal gene transfer, which reflects both its highly mobile genome, the complexity of the gut microbiota and an adjustment of sporulation to this particular ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Transvection is the phenomenon where a transcriptional enhancer activates a promoter located on the homologous chromosome. It has been amply documented in Drosophila where homologues are closely paired in most, if not all, somatic nuclei, but it has been known to rarely occur in mammals as well. We have taken advantage of site-directed transgenesis to insert reporter constructs into the same genetic locus in Drosophila and have evaluated their ability to engage in transvection by testing many heterozygous combinations. We find that transvection requires the presence of an insulator element on both homologues. Homotypic trans-interactions between four different insulators can support transvection: the gypsy insulator (GI), Wari, Fab-8 and 1A2; GI and Fab-8 are more effective than Wari or 1A2. We show that in the presence of insulators, transvection displays the characteristics that have been previously described: it requires homologue pairing, but can happen at any of several loci in the genome; a solitary enhancer confronted with an enhancerless reporter is sufficient to drive transcription; it is weaker than the action of the same enhancer-promoter pair in cis and it is further suppressed by cis-promoter competition. Though necessary, the presence of homotypic insulators is not sufficient for transvection; their position, number and orientation matters. A single GI adjacent to both enhancer and promoter is the optimal configuration. The addition of a heterologous insulator in one homolog can positively or negatively influence transvection strength. The local landscape of enhancers and promoters is also important, indicative of complex insulator-enhancer-promoter interactions.",

    "abstract": "Early and late leaf spots are the major foliar diseases of peanut responsible for severely decreased yield in the absence of intensive fungicide spray programs. Pyramiding host resistance to leaf spots in elite cultivars is a sustainable solution to mitigate the diseases. In order to determine the genetic control of leaf spot disease resistance in peanut, a recombinant inbred line population (Florida-07 x GP-NC WS16) segregating for resistance to both diseases was used to construct a SNP-based linkage map consisting of 855 loci. QTL mapping revealed three resistance QTLs for late leaf spot qLLSA05 (phenotypic variation explained, PVE=7-10%), qLLSB03 (PVE=5-7%), and qLLSB05 (PVE=15-41%) that were consistently expressed over multi-year analysis. Two QTL, qLLSA05 and qLLSB05, confirmed our previously published QTL-seq results. For early leaf spot, three resistance QTLs were identified in multiple years, two on chromosome A03 (PVE=8-12%) and one on chromosome B03 (PVE=13-20%), with the locus qELSA03_1.1 coinciding with the previously published genomic region for LLS resistance in GPBD4. Comparative analysis of the genomic regions spanning the QTLs suggests that resistance to early and late leaf spots are largely genetically independent. In addition, QTL analysis on yield showed that the presence of resistance allele in qLLSB03 and qLLSB05 loci might result in protection from yield loss caused by LLS disease damage. Finally, post hoc analysis of the RIL subpopulation that was not utilized in the QTL mapping revealed that the flanking markers for these QTLs can successfully select for resistant and susceptible lines, confirming the effectiveness of pyramiding these resistance loci to improve host-plant resistance in peanut breeding programs using marker-assisted selection.",

The miRNA expression levels in cells are associated with diverse diseases including cancers. MiRNA inhibitors have been widely employed for studying the functions and targets of miRNAs by transfecting the inhibitors into cells. The concentrations of miRNA inhibitors used for such studies can vary depending on the types of miRNAs being tested, the cell lines under study, and the analysis methods. Therefore, in order to obtain accurate results, appropriate amounts of miRNA inhibitors have to be used in the experiments. Apart from amounts, the evaluation of inhibitors may also have to be conducted for functional studies.\\n\\nHere we developed capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence (CE-LIF) method for evaluating miRNA inhibitor and for optimizing miRNA inhibitor concentrations, in the A549 lung cancer cell line. The target miRNAs, miRNA-23a and miRNA-24 are biomarker candidates in lung cancer cell lines. Our results showed that miRNA-23a and miRNA-24 were effectively inhibited upon transfection with 20 nM miRNA inhibitors using CE-LIF method. Furthermore, these results demonstrated the potential of CE for fast, specific, sensitive and specific analyses for the evaluation and determination of the optimal concentration of miRNA inhibitors for functional studies.\\n\\nAbstract Graphics\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=127 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/566786v4_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (31K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2bbfeeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@45b7e3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12ba79borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@108ec2f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

However, whether these variants function in specific cell states or stages of cell activation is unknown. We stimulated T cells and macrophages in the presence of thirteen different cytokine cocktails linked to immune diseases and profiled active enhancers and promoters together with regions of open chromatin. We observed that T cell activation induced major chromatin remodelling, while additional exposure to cytokines fine-tuned the magnitude of these changes. Therefore, we developed a new statistical method that accounts for subtle changes in chromatin landscape to identify SNP enrichment across cell states. Our results point towards the role of immune disease variants in early rather than late activation of memory CD4+ T cells, and with limited differences across polarizing cytokines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that inflammatory bowel disease variants are enriched in chromatin regions active in Th1 cells, while asthma variants overlap regions active in Th2 cells. We also show that Alzheimers disease variants are enriched in different macrophage cell states.

    "abstract": "The allele frequency dependence of the ranges of all measures of linkage disequilibrium is well-known. The maximum values of commonly used parameters such as r2 and D vary depending on the allele frequencies at each locus. However, though this phenomenon is recognized and accounted for in many studies, the comprehensive mathematical framework underlying the limits of linkage disequilibrium measures at various frequency combinations is often heuristic or empirical. Here, it is demonstrated that underlying this behavior is the fundamental shift between linear and nonlinear dependence in the linkage disequilibrium structure between loci. The proportion of linear and nonlinear dependence can be estimated and it demonstrates how even the same values of r2 can have different implications for the nature of the overall dependence. One result of this is the value of D', when defined as only a positive number, has a minimum value of |r|. Understanding this dependence is crucial to making correct inferences about the relationships between two loci in linkage disequilibrium.",

    "abstract": "Mendelian randomization (MR) investigations with large numbers of genetic variants are becoming increasingly common. However, the reliability of findings from a MR investigation is dependent on the validity of the genetic variants as instrumental variables. We developed a method to identify groups of genetic variants with similar causal effect estimates, which may represent distinct mechanisms by which the risk factor influences the outcome. Our contamination mixture method is a robust and efficient method for valid MR in the presence of invalid IVs. Compared to other robust methods, our method had the lowest mean squared error across a range of realistic scenarios. The method is fast and efficient, and can perform analysis with hundreds of variants in a fraction of a second. In a MR analysis for high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, the method identified 11 variants associated with increased HDL-cholesterol, decreased triglyceride levels, and decreased CHD risk that had the same directions of associations with platelet distribution width and other blood cell traits, suggesting a shared mechanism linking lipids and CHD risk relating to platelet aggregation.",

    "abstract": "Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) are a key component in generating mouse models for human diseases and performing basic research on pluripotency, but how many genes are essential for mESCs is still unknown. We performed a genome-wide screen for essential genes in mESCs and compared it to human cells. We found that essential genes are enriched for basic cellular functions, are highly expressed in mESCs, and tend to lack paralog genes. Notably, we discovered that genes that are essential specifically in mESCs play a role in pathways associated with their pluripotent state. We show that 25% of human genes that are intolerant to loss-of-function mutations are essential in mouse or human ESCs and that the human phenotypes most significantly associated with essential genes are neurodevelopmental. Our results provide insights into essential genes in the mouse, the pathways which govern pluripotency, and suggest that many genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders are essential at very early embryonic stages.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have generally focused on a single phenotype of interest. Emerging biobanks that pair genotype data from thousands of individuals with phenotype data using medical records or surveys enable testing for genetic associations in each phenotype assayed. However, methods for characterizing shared genetic architecture among multiple traits are lagging behind. Here, we present a new method, Ward clustering to identify Internal Node branch length outliers using Gene Scores (WINGS), for characterizing shared and divergent genetic architecture among multiple phenotypes. The objective of WINGS (freely available at https://github.com/ramachandran-lab/PEGASUS-WINGS) is to identify groups of phenotypes, or \\\"clusters\\\", that share a core set of genes enriched for mutations in cases. We show in simulations that WINGS can reliably detect phenotype clusters across a range of percent shared architecture and number of phenotypes included. We then use the gene-level association test PEGASUS with WINGS to characterize shared genetic architecture among 87 case-control and seven quantitative phenotypes in 349,468 unrelated European-ancestry individuals from the UK Biobank. We identify 10 significant phenotype clusters that contain two to eight phenotypes. One significant cluster of seven immunological phenotypes is driven by seven genes; these genes have each been associated with two or more of those same phenotypes in past publications. WINGS offers a precise and efficient new application of Ward hierarchical clustering to generate hypotheses regarding shared genetic architecture among phenotypes in the biobank era.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) can be considered as a stressful and challenging disease among all women in the world, which has been associated with a poor prognosis and its molecular pathogenesis has remained unclear. In recent years, RNA Sequencing (RNA-seq) has become a functional and amazing technology for profiling gene expression. In the present study, RNA-seq raw data from Sequence Read Archive (SRA) of six tumor and normal ovarian sample was extracted, and then analysis and statistical interpretation was done with Linux and R Packages from the open-source Bioconductor. Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were applied for the identification of key genes and pathways involved in EOC. We identified 1091 Differential Expression Genes (DEGs) which have been reported in various studies of ovarian cancer as well as other types of cancer. Among them, 333 genes were up-regulated and 273 genes were down-regulated. In addition, Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) including RPL41, ALDH3A2, ERBB2, MIEN1, RBM25, ATF4, UPF2, DDIT3, HOXB8 and IL17D as well as Ribosome and Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis pathway have had the potentiality to be used as targets for EOC diagnosis and treatment. In this study, unlike that of any other studies on various cancers, ALDH3A2 was most down-regulated gene in most KEGG pathways, and ATF4 was most up-regulated gene in leucine zipper domain binding term. In the other hand, RPL41 as a regulatory of cellular ATF4 level was up-regulated in many term and pathways and augmentation of ATF4 could justify the increase of RPL41 in the EOC. Pivotal pathways and significant genes, which were identified in the present study, can be used for adaptation of different EOC study. However, further molecular biological experiments and computational processes are required to confirm the function of the identified genes associated with EOC.",

The large number of genetically-distinct arbovirus species, coupled with the unpredictable nature of their outbreaks, has made developing virus-specific anti-viral medicines challenging. Instead, we have defined and targeted a key aspect of the host innate immune response to virus at the arthropod bite that is common to all arbovirus infections, potentially circumventing the need for virus-specific therapies at this site. Using mouse models and human skin explants, we identify innate immune responses by dermal macrophages in the skin as a key determinant of disease severity. Post-exposure treatment of the inoculation site by a topical innate immune agonist significantly suppressed both the local and subsequent systemic course of infection and improved clinical outcome in mice to infection with a variety of arboviruses from the Alphavirus, Flavivirus and Orthobunyavirus genuses. In the absence of treatment, anti-viral interferon expression to virus in the skin was restricted to dermal dendritic cells. In contrast, targeting the more populous skin-resident macrophages with an immune agonist elicited protective responses in key cellular targets of virus that otherwise replicated virus to high levels. By defining and targeting a key aspect of the innate immune response to virus at the mosquito bite site, we have shown that it is possible to improve outcome to infection by targeting pathways activated at the site of inoculation, and thereby identified a putative new strategy for limiting disease following infection with a variety of genetically-distinct arboviruses.\\n\\nOne-sentence summaryWe demonstrate that activation of innate immune responses to arbovirus at the mosquito bite is a limiting factor for preventing efficient systemic dissemination of virus and that therapeutic targeting of skin-resident macrophages can have defining inhibitory effects on the later systemic course.",

    "abstract": "Attachment is a necessary first step in bacterial commitment to surface-associated behaviors that include colonization, biofilm formation, and host-directed virulence. The Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa can initially attach to surfaces via its single polar flagellum. Although many bacteria quickly detach, some become irreversibly attached and express surface-associated structures, such as Type IV pili, and behaviors, including twitching motility and biofilm initiation. P. aeruginosa that lack the GTPase FlhF assemble a randomly placed flagellum that is motile; however, we observed that these mutant bacteria show defects in biofilm formation comparable to those seen for non-motile, aflagellate bacteria. This phenotype was associated with altered behavior of {Delta}flhF bacteria immediately following surface-attachment. Forward and reverse genetic screens led to the discovery that FlhF interacts with FimV to control flagellar rotation at a surface, and implicated cAMP signaling in this pathway. Although cAMP controls many transcriptional programs in P. aeruginosa, the known targets of this second messenger were not required to modulate flagellar rotation in surface-attached bacteria. Instead, alterations in switching behavior of the motor appear to result from previously undescribed effects of cAMP on switch complex proteins and/or the motor-stators associated with them.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAttachment to a surface often triggers programs of gene expression that alter the behavior, virulence and fitness of bacteria. Initial contact is usually mediated by surface exposed adhesins, such as flagella or pili/fimbriae, and there is much interest in how these structures might sense and respond to surface attachment. The human bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa usually contacts surfaces via its polar flagellum, the rotary motor that also powers bacterial swimming. We observed that wild-type bacteria quickly stopped rotating their flagellum after surface attachment, but that a mutant lacking the flagellar-associated protein FlhF did not. Using a combination of genetic approaches, we demonstrated that FlhF interacts with a component of the flagellar rotor (FliG) and with a polar scaffolding protein that positively regulates cAMP production (FimV) to stop flagellar rotation and thereby favor bacterial persistence at a surface. We provide evidence that the second messenger cAMP is the likely signal generated by flagellar-mediated surface attachment and show that cAMP is sufficient to alter the behavior of the flagellar motor.",

    "abstract": "Paracoccidioides spp. are thermodimorphic pathogenic fungi endemic to Latin America. Predation is believed to drive the evolution of virulence for soil saprophytes. We evaluated the presence of environmental amoeboid predators in soil from armadillo burrows where Paracoccidioides had been previously detected and tested if interaction of Paracoccidioides with amoebae increased fungal virulence. Nematodes, ciliates and amoebae - all potential predators of fungi - grew in cultures from soil samples. Microscopical observation and ITS sequencing identified the amoebae as Acanthamoeba spp, Allovahlkampfia spelaea and Vermamoeba vermiformis. These three amoebae efficiently ingested, killed and digested Paracoccidioides spp. yeast cells, as did laboratory-adapted axenic Acanthamoeba castellanii. Sequential co-cultivation of Paracoccidioides with A. castellanii selected for phenotypical traits related to survival of the fungus within a natural predator as well as in murine macrophages and in vivo (Galleria mellonella and mice). This increase in virulence is linked to the accumulation of cell wall alpha-glucans, polysaccharides that masks recognition of fungal molecular patterns by host pattern recognition receptors. Altogether, our results indicate that Paracoccidioides inhabits a complex environment with multiple amoeboid predators that can exert selective pressure to guide the evolution of virulence traits.",

DKO mice resembled Fyn KO in cognitive tasks and resembled tau KO mice in motor tasks and protection from pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures. In Ca2+ response, Fyn KO was decreased relative to WT and DKO had a greater reduction relative to Fyn KO, suggesting that tau may have a Fyn-independent role. Since tau KO resembled WT in its Ca2+ response, we investigated whether MAP2 served to compensate for tau, since its level was increased in tau KO but decreased in DKO mice. We found that like tau, MAP2 increased Fyn activity. Moreover, tau KO neurons had increased density of dendritic MAP2-Fyn complexes relative to WT neurons. Therefore, we hypothesize that in the tau KO, the absence of tau would be compensated by MAP2, especially in the dendrites, where tau-Fyn complexes are of critical importance. In the DKO, decreased levels of MAP2 made compensation more difficult, thus revealing the effect of tau in the Ca2+ response.\\n\\nSummary StatementThe downstream effect of the interaction between microtubule-associated protein tau and Src family non-receptor tyrosine kinase Fyn was investigated with a tau/Fyn double KO mouse.

Using electrophysiological recordings, optogenetic stimulation, and single-cell PCR analysis, we investigated functional patterns of synaptic connectivity in striatal SST-INs expressing channelrhodopsin-2. Photostimulation of these cells induced both glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) and fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs). The two synaptic components showed equally fast onset latencies, suggesting a mechanism of co-transmission. Accordingly, single-cell PCR analysis revealed that individual striatal SST-INs expressed mRNAs for both glutamate and GABA vesicular transporters (VGLUT1 and VGAT, respectively). During relatively prolonged optical stimuli (0.5-1s), IPSC arrays consistently outlasted EPSCs. As a result, photostimulation of SST-INs caused a transient burst of action potentials followed by a prolonged inhibition in postsynaptic cells.\\n\\nThese data suggest that striatal SST-INs are specialized to locally project synapses exerting a composite excitatory and inhibitory effect through GABA/glutamate co-transmission onto different postsynaptic targets.",

Canary songs are comprised of repeated syllables, called phrases, and the ordering of these phrases follows long-range rules, where the choice of what to sing depends on song structure many seconds prior. The neural substrates that support these long-range correlations are unknown. Using miniature head-mounted microscopes and cell-type-specific genetic tools, we observed neural activity in the premotor nucleus HVC as canaries explore various phrase sequences in their repertoire. We find neurons that encode past transitions, extending over 4 phrases and spanning up to 3 seconds and 40 syllables. These neurons preferentially encode past actions rather than future actions, can reflect more than a single song history, and occur mostly during the rare phrases that involve history-dependent transitions in song. These findings demonstrate that network dynamics in HVC reflect preceding behavior context relevant to flexible transitions.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the RNA-binding protein FUS cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a devastating neurodegenerative disease in which the loss of motor neurons induces progressive weakness and death from respiratory failure, typically only 3-5 years after onset. FUS plays a role in numerous aspects of RNA metabolism, including mRNA splicing. However, the impact of ALS-causative mutations on splicing has not been fully characterised, as most disease models have been based on FUS overexpression, which in itself alters its RNA processing functions. To overcome this, we and others have recently created knock-in models, and have generated high depth RNA-sequencing data on FUS mutants in parallel to FUS knockout. We combined three independent datasets with a joint modelling approach, allowing us to compare the mutation-induced changes to genuine loss of function. We find that FUS ALS-mutations induce a widespread loss of function on expression and splicing, with a preferential effect on RNA binding proteins. Mutant FUS induces intron retention changes through RNA binding, and we identify an intron retention event in FUS itself that is associated with its autoregulation. Altered FUS regulation has been linked to disease, and intriguingly, we find FUS autoregulation to be altered not only by FUS mutations, but also in other genetic forms of ALS, including those caused by TDP-43, VCP and SOD1 mutations, supporting the concept that multiple ALS genes interact in a regulatory network.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHexose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (H6PDH) is a generator of NADPH in the Endoplasmic/Sarcoplasmic Reticulum (ER/SR). Interaction of H6PDH with 11{beta}-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 provides NADPH to support oxo-reduction of inactive to active glucocorticoids, but the wider understanding of H6PDH in ER/SR NAD(P)(H) homeostasis is incomplete. Muscle specific lack of H6PDH results in a deteriorating skeletal myopathy, altered glucose homeostasis, ER stress and activation of the unfolded protein response. Here we further assess muscle responses to H6PDH deficiency to delineate pathways that may underpin myopathy and link SR redox status to muscle wide metabolic adaptation.\\n\\nMethodsWe analysed skeletal muscle from H6PDH knockout (H6PDKO), H6PDH and NRK2 double knockout (DKO) and wild-type (WT) mice. H6PDKO mice were supplemented with the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide riboside. Skeletal muscle samples were subject to biochemical analysis including NAD(H) measurement, LC/MS based metabolomics, Western immunoblotting, and high resolution mitochondrial respirometry. Genetic and supplement models were assessed for degree of myopathy compared to H6PDKO.\\n\\nResultsH6PDKO skeletal muscle showed adaptations in the routes regulating nicotinamide and NAD+ biosynthesis, with significant activation of the Nicotinamide Riboside Kinase 2 (NRK2) pathway. Associated with changes in NAD+ biosynthesis H6PDKO muscle had impaired mitochondrial respiratory capacity with altered mitochondrial acylcarnitine and acetyl CoA metabolism. Boosting NAD+ levels through the NRK2 pathway using the precursor nicotinamide riboside had no effect to mitigate ER stress and dysfunctional mitochondrial respiratory capacity or Acetyl-CoA metabolism. Similarly, H6PDKO/NRK2 double KO mice did not display an exaggerated timing or severity of myopathy or overt change in mitochondrial metabolism despite depression of NAD+ availability.\\n\\nConclusionsThese findings suggest a complex metabolic response to changes to muscle SR NADP(H) redox status that result in impaired mitochondrial energy metabolism and activation of cellular NAD+ salvage pathways. It is possible that SR can sense and signal perturbation in NAD(P)(H) that cannot be rectified in the absence of H6PDH. Whether NRK2 pathway activation is a direct response to changes in SR NAD(P)(H) availability or adaptation to deficits in metabolic energy availability remains to be resolved.",

    "abstract": "The highly efficient C4 photosynthetic pathway is facilitated by  Kranz leaf anatomy. In Kranz leaves, closely spaced veins are encircled by concentric layers of photosynthetic bundle sheath (inner) and mesophyll (outer) cells. Here we demonstrate that in the C4 monocot maize, Kranz patterning is regulated by redundant function of SCARECROW 1 (ZmSCR1) and a previously uncharacterized homeolog ZmSCR1h. ZmSCR1 and ZmSCR1h transcripts accumulate in ground meristem cells of developing leaf primordia and in Zmscr1;Zmscr1h mutant leaves, most veins are separated by one rather than two mesophyll cells; many veins have sclerenchyma above and/or below instead of mesophyll cells; and supernumerary bundle sheath cells develop. The mutant defects are unified by compromised mesophyll cell development. In addition to Kranz defects, Zmscr1;Zmscr1h mutants fail to form an organized endodermal layer in the root. Collectively, these data indicate that ZmSCR1 and ZmSCR1h redundantly regulate cell-type patterning in both leaves and roots of maize. Leaf and root pathways are distinguished, however, by the cell layer in which they operate - mesophyll at a two-cell distance from leaf veins versus endodermis immediately adjacent to root vasculature.\\n\\nSummary statementTwo duplicated maize SCARECROW genes control the development of the endodermis in roots and the mesophyll in leaves",

    "abstract": "Synthetic DNA has been gaining momentum as a potential storage medium for archival data storage1-9. Digital information is translated into sequences of nucleotides and the resulting synthetic DNA strands are then stored for later individual file retrieval via PCR7-9 (Fig. 1a). Using a previously presented encoding scheme9 and new experiments, we demonstrate reliable file recovery when as few as 10 copies per sequence are stored, on average. This results in density of about 17 exabytes/g, nearly two orders of magnitude greater than prior work has shown6. Further, no prior work has experimentally demonstrated access to specific files in a pool more complex than approximately 106 unique DNA sequences9, leaving the issue of accurate file retrieval at high data density and complexity unexamined. Here, we demonstrate successful PCR random access using three files of varying sizes in a complex pool of over 1010 unique sequences, with no evidence that we have begun to approach complexity limits. We further investigate the role of file size on successful data recovery, the effect of increasing sequencing coverage to aid file recovery, and whether DNA strands drop out of solution in a systematic manner. These findings substantiate the robustness of PCR as a random access mechanism in complex settings, and that the number of copies needed for data retrieval does not compromise density significantly.\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=111 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/565150_fig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (29K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4b79a7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11fca45org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18b830org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e47101_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 1.C_FLOATNO (a) A high-level representation of the DNA data storage pipeline.

The smallest percent of pool accessed is calculated by dividing the size of the smallest file by the number of unique sequences in the 1 {micro}L of solution used for PCR random access.

    "abstract": "Broad spectrum antibiotics can cause both transient and lasting damage to the ecology of the gut microbiome. Loss of gut bacterial diversity has been linked to immune dysregulation and disease susceptibility. Antibiotic-resistant populations of cells are known to arise spontaneously in single-strain systems. Furthermore, prior work on subtherapeutic antibiotic treatment in humans and therapeutic treatments in non-human animals have suggested that entire gut communities may exhibit spontaneous resistance phenotypes. In this study, we validate the existence of these community resistance phenotypes in the murine gut and explore how antibiotic duration or diet influence the frequency of this phenotype. We find that almost a third of mice exhibit whole-community resistance to a therapeutic concentration of the {beta}-lactam antibiotic cefoperazone, independent of antibiotic treatment duration or xenobiotic dietary amendment. These non-responder (i.e. resistant) microbiota were protected from biomass depletion, transient ecological community collapse, and lasting diversity loss seen in the susceptible microbiota. There were no major differences between non-responder microbiota and untreated control microbiota at the community structure level. However, gene expression was vastly different between non-responder microbiota and controls during antibiotic treatment, with non-responder communities showing an upregulation of antimicrobial resistance genes and a down-regulation of central metabolism. Thus, non-responder phenotypes appear to combat antibiotic assault through a combination of efflux transporter upregulation and a reduced growth rate across the entire gut community. Future work should focus on what factors are responsible for tipping entire communities from susceptible to resistant phenotypes so that we might harness this phenomenon to protect our microbiota from exposure to therapeutic antibiotic treatment regimes.",
