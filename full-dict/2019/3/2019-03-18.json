    "abstract": "Understanding whether and how the schizophrenia polygenic risk score (SZ PRS) predicts course of illness could improve diagnostics and prognostication in psychotic disorders. We tested whether the SZ PRS predicts symptoms, cognition, illness severity, and diagnostic changes over the 20 years following first admission. The Suffolk County Mental Health Project is an inception cohort study of first-admission patients with psychosis. Patients were assessed six times over 20 years, and 249 provided DNA. Geographically- and demographically-matched never psychotic adults were recruited at year 20, and 205 provided DNA. Symptoms were rated using the Schedule for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms and Schedule for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms. Cognition was evaluated with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. Illness severity and diagnosis were determined by consensus of study psychiatrists. SZ PRS was significantly higher in first-admission than never psychotic groups. Within the psychosis cohort, the SZ PRS predicted more severe negative symptoms ({beta} = 0.21), lower GAF ({beta} = -0.28), and worse cognition ({beta} = -0.35), across the follow-up. The SZ PRS was the strongest predictor of diagnostic shifts from affective to non-affective psychosis over the 20 years (AUC = 0.62). The SZ PRS predicts persistent differences in cognition and negative symptoms. The SZ PRS also predicts who among those who appear to have a mood disorder with psychosis at first admission will ultimately be diagnosed with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. These findings show potential for the SZ PRS to become a powerful tool for diagnosis and treatment planning.",

    "abstract": "Upon immunogenic challenge, lymph nodes become mechanically stiff as immune cells proliferate within their encapsulated environments, and with resolution, they reestablish a soft, baseline state. We found that these mechanical changes in the microenvironment promote and then restrict T-cell activation and metabolic reprogramming. Sensing of tissue mechanics by T cells requires the mechanosensor YAP. Unlike in other cells where YAP promotes proliferation, YAP in T cells suppresses proliferation in a stiffness-dependent manner by directly restricting the translocation of NFAT into the nucleus. YAP regulates T-cell responses against viral infections and in autoimmune diabetes.

    "abstract": "BackgroundDrug-eluting stents (DES) represent the main-stream management of restenosis following treatments of occlusive cardiovascular diseases. However, DES cannot eliminate instent restenosis yet exacerbate thrombogenic risks. To achieve dual inhibition of restenotic smooth muscle cell (SMC) de-differentiation/proliferation and thrombogenic endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction, a common target in both cell types, has been long-sought after. We evaluated the potential of protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) as such a target for low-thrombogenic anti-restenotic intervention.\\n\\nMethods and ResultsWe used a rat angioplasty model of restenosis and a FeCl3-induced mouse model of thrombosis. Loss-or gain-of-function was achieved by PERK inhibition (GSK2606414, siRNA) or overexpression (adenovirus). Restenosis was robustly mitigated by GSK2606414 administered either via injected (i.v.) lesion-homing platelet membrane-coated nanoclusters or a perivascular hydrogel; it was enhanced by PERK transgene. Whereas PERK inhibition blocked, its overexpression exacerbated PDGF-induced human aortic SMC de-differentiation (reduced smooth muscle -actin or SMA) and proliferation (BrdU incorporation). Further, PERK activity promoted STAT3 activation but inhibited SRF transcriptional (luciferase) activity; its protein co-immunoprecipitated with STAT3 and also MRTF-A, the SRF activator for SMA transcription. Importantly, PERK inhibition also prevented TNF-induced impairment of human EC growth and upregulation of thrombogenic tissue factor, both in vitro and ex vivo. In vivo, oral gavage of GSK2606414 preserved ~50% of the normal blood flow 60 min after FeCl3-induced vascular injury.\\n\\nConclusionsPERK inhibition is dual beneficial in mitigating restenosis and thrombosis, thus implicating a potential design for anti-restenotic intervention to overcome the thrombogenicity of DES.",

    "abstract": "The short wavelength, i.e. blue light, is crucial for non-image forming effects such as entrainment of circadian system. Moreover, many studies showed that blue light enhances alertness and performance in cognitive tasks. However, most of scientific reports in this topic is based on studies using short exposure to blue or blue-enriched light and only few focused on the effects of its reduced transmittance, especially in longer period. The latter could potentially give insight into understanding if age-related sleep problems and cognitive decline are related to less amount of blue light reaching the retina, as our lenses become more yellow with age. In this study, we investigated the effects of prolonged blocking of blue light on cognitive functioning, in particular - sustained attention and visuospatial working memory, and sleep. We used amber contact lenses reducing transmittance of blue light by approximately 90% for the period of four weeks on a group of young, healthy participants. No changes were observed for measurements related to sleep and sleep-wake rhythm. The significant effect was shown both for sustained attention and visuospatial memory, i.e. the longer blocking the blue light lasted, the greater decrease in performance was observed. Additionally, the follow-up session was conducted (approximately one week after taking off the blue-blocking lenses) and revealed that in case of sustained attention this detrimental effect of blocking BL is fully reversible. Our findings provide evidence that prolonged reduction of BL exposure directly affects human cognitive functioning regardless of sleep-related conditions.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities exert a pivotal role in the biodegradation of xenobiotics including pesticides1. In the case of atrazine, multiple studies have shown that its degradation involved a consortia rather than a single species2,3,4,5, but little is known about how interdependency between the species composing the consortium is set up. The Black Queen Hypothesis (BQH) formalized theoretically the conditions leading to the evolution of dependency between species6: members of the community called  helpers provide publicly common goods obtained from the costly degradation of a compound, while others called  beneficiaries take advantage of the public goods, but lose access to the primary resource through adaptive degrading gene loss. Here, we test whether liquid media supplemented with the herbicide atrazine could support coexistence of bacterial species through BQH mechanisms. We observed the establishment of dependencies between species through atrazine degrading gene loss. Labour sharing between members of the consortium led to coexistence of multiple species on a single resource and improved atrazine degradation potential. Until now, pesticide degradation has not been approached from an evolutionary perspective under the BQH framework. We provide here an evolutionary explanation that might invite researchers to consider microbial consortia, rather than single isolated species, as an optimal strategy for isolation of xenobiotics degraders. Also, we anticipate that future research should focus on the bioaugmentation with stabilized and tightly structured microbial degrading consortia as an effective solution for in situ bioremediation of sites polluted with recalcitrant compounds.",

    "abstract": "Finding an efficient framework for estimating total narrow-sense heritability in admixed populations remains an open question. In this work, we used extensive simulations to evaluate existing linear mixed model frameworks in estimating total narrow-sense heritability in two population-based cohorts from Greenland and compared the results to data from unadmixed individuals from Denmark. When our analysis focused on Greenlandic sib pairs, the model with two relationship matrices, one capturing identity by descent and one capturing identity by state, returned heritability estimates close to the true simulated value, while using each of the two matrices alone led to downward biases. When phenotypes correlated with ancestry, heritability estimates were inflated. Based on these observations, we propose a post-estimation PCA-based adjustment that recovers successfully the true simulated heritability. We use this knowledge to estimate the heritability of ten quantitative traits from the two Greenlandic cohorts and report differences such as lower heritability for height in Greenlanders compared to Europeans. In conclusion, narrow-sense heritability in admixed populations is best estimated using a mixture of genetic relationship matrices on individuals with at least one first-degree relative included in the sample.",

    "abstract": "Idiopathic retinal detachment is a serious common condition, but genetic studies to date have been hampered by the small size of the assembled cohorts. Genetic correlations between retinal detachment and high myopia or cataract operation were high, respectively 0.46 (SE=0.08) and 0.44 (SE=0.07), in the UK Biobank dataset and in line with known epidemiological associations. Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies using UK Biobank retinal detachment cases (N=3977) and two cohorts, each comprising [~]1000 rhegmatogenous retinal detachment patients, uncovered 11 genome-wide significant association signals, near or within ZC3H11B, BMP3, COL22A1, DLG5, PLCE1, EFEMP2, TYR, FAT3, TRIM29, COL2A1 and LOXL1. Replication in the 23andMe dataset, where retinal detachment is self-reported by participants, firmly establishes association at six loci FAT3, COL22A1, TYR, BMP3, ZC3H11B and PLCE1. The former two seem to particularly impact on retinal detachment, the latter three shed light on shared aetiologies with cataract, myopia and glaucoma.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryRetinal detachments are common conditions that may lead to permanent severe sight reduction or blindness; they are a major cause of emergency eye surgery. The most common type of retinal detachment follows a break in the retina and is thought to be in part genetically determined but little is known about the contributing individual genetic risk variants. The condition prevalence increases with age and with common eye conditions such as myopia, cataract or glaucoma. We showed that the retinal detachment cases derived from self-report or hospitalisation records in the large UK Biobank dataset show very similar characteristics to samples of carefully clinically evaluated retinal detachment with break cases and therefore could be used to perform genetic analysis of the condition. Association studies require large sample of cases and by pooling Biobank and clinical cases, this study identifies 11 novel significant associations, six of which were further replicated in an independent population-based dataset (23andMe). Two of the replicated findings seem to specifically underline retinal detachment risk while three others highlight shared genetic risk with myopia, cataract and/or glaucoma, paving the way to better understanding of these conditions and of their overlap.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B streptococcus, GBS) is a coloniser of the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts, and an opportunistic pathogen of infants and adults. The worldwide population of GBS is characterised by Clonal Complexes (CCs) with different invasive potentials. CC17 for example, is a hypervirulent lineage commonly associated with neonatal sepsis and meningitis, while CC1 is less invasive in neonates and more commonly causes invasive disease in adults with co-morbidities. The genetic basis of GBS virulence and to what extent different CCs have adapted to different host environments remain uncertain. We have therefore applied a pan-genome wide association study approach to 1988 GBS strains isolated from different hosts and countries. Our analysis identified 279 CC-specific genes associated with virulence, disease, metabolism and regulation of cellular mechanisms that may explain the differential virulence potential of particular CCs. In CC17 and CC23 for example, we have identified genes encoding for pilus, quorum sensing proteins, and proteins for the uptake of ions and micronutrients which are absent in less invasive lineages. Moreover, in CC17, carriage and disease strains were distinguished by the allelic variants of 21 of these CC-specific genes. Together our data highlight the lineage-specific basis of GBS niche adaptation and virulence, and suggest that human-associated GBS CCs have largely evolved in animal hosts before crossing to the humans and then spreading clonally.",

    "abstract": "Mucorales spores, the causative agents of mucormycosis, interact with the innate immune system to cause acute, chronic, or resolving infection. Understanding the factors that influence disease initiation and progression is key to understanding mucormycosis and developing new treatments. Complicating this, mucormycosis can be caused by a number of species that span the Mucorales order and may be host to bacterial endosymbionts. This study sets out to examine the differences between two species in the Mucorales order by characterising their differential interactions with the innate immune system, and their interactions with environmental bacterial endosymbionts. Through a holistic approach, this study examines the transcriptional responses of Rhizopus delemar and Rhizopus microsporus, two of the most commonly diagnosed species, to innate immune cells. This study also examines the immune cell response and assesses the variation in these responses, given the presence or absence of bacterial endosymbionts within the fungi. We see that the fungal response is driven by interaction with innate immune cells. Moreover, the effect of the bacterial endosymbiont on the fungus is species-specific and strongly influences fungal transcription during phagocyte stress. The macrophage response varies depending on the infecting fungal species, and depending on endosymbiont status. Macrophages are better able to survive when germination is inhibited, or upon a pro-inflammatory response. This work reveals species-specific host responses to related Mucorales spores and shows that bacterial endosymbionts have an important role to play by impacting both innate immune cell response, and fungal response when under stress.",

A3G has two zing-binding domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD), which efficiently binds ssDNA, and the C-terminal catalytic domain (CTD), which supports deaminase activity of A3G. Until now, structural information on A3G has lacked, preventing elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying its interaction with ssDNA and deaminase activity. We have recently built computational model for the full-length A3G monomer and validated its structure by data obtained from time-lapse High-Speed Atomic Force Microscopy (HS AFM). Here time-lapse HS AFM was applied to directly visualize the structure and dynamics of A3G in complexes with ssDNA. Our results demonstrate a highly dynamic structure of A3G, where two domains of the protein fluctuate between compact globular and extended dumbbell structures. Quantitative analysis of our data revealed a substantial increase in the number of A3G dumbbell structures in the presence of the DNA substrate, suggesting the interaction of A3G with the ssDNA substrate stabilizes this dumbbell structure. Based on these data, we developed a model explaining the interaction of globular and dumbbell structures of A3G with ssDNA and suggested a possible role of the dumbbell structure in A3G function.",

    "abstract": "Aging is characterized by a gradual loss of function occurring at the molecular, cellular, tissue and organismal levels1-3. At the chromatin level, aging is associated with the progressive accumulation of epigenetic errors that eventually lead to aberrant gene regulation, stem cell exhaustion, senescence, and deregulated cell/tissue homeostasis3. The technology of nuclear reprogramming to pluripotency, through over-expression of a small number of transcription factors, can revert both the age and the identity of any cell to that of an embryonic cell by driving epigenetic reprogramming2,4,5. Recent evidence has shown that transient transgenic reprogramming can ameliorate age-associated hallmarks and extend lifespan in progeroid mice6. However, it is unknown how this form of  epigenetic rejuvenation would apply to physiologically aged cells and, importantly, how it might translate to human cells. Here we show that transient reprogramming, mediated by transient expression of mRNAs, promotes a rapid reversal of both cellular aging and of epigenetic clock in human fibroblasts and endothelial cells, reduces the inflammatory profile in human chondrocytes, and restores youthful regenerative response to aged, human muscle stem cells, in each case without abolishing cellular identity. Our method, that we named Epigenetic Reprogramming of Aging (ERA), paves the way to a novel, potentially translatable strategy for ex vivo cell rejuvenation treatment. In addition, ERA holds promise for in vivo tissue rejuvenation therapies to reverse the physiological manifestations of aging and the risk for the development of age-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Bet-hedging evolves in fluctuating environments because long-term genotype success is determined by geometric mean fitness across generations. However, specialist versus generalist strategies are usually considered in terms of arithmetic mean fitness benefits to individuals, as in habitat or foraging preferences. We model how environmental variability affects phenotypic variation within and among individuals to maximize either long-term arithmetic versus geometric mean fitness. For traits with additive fitness effects within lifetimes (e.g. foraging-related traits), genotypes of similar generalists or diversified specialists perform equally well. However, if fitness effects are multiplicative within lifetimes (e.g. sequential survival probabilities), generalist individuals are always favored, since geometric mean fitness favors greater within-individual phenotypic variation than arithmetic mean fitness does. Interestingly, this conservative bet-hedging effect outcompetes diversifying bet-hedging.

A key challenge of evolutionary biology is therefore to understand how organisms adapt to such variation within and among generations, and currently represents a knowledge gap in evolutionary theory. Here we focus on how traits evolve when the (changing) environment determines the optimal value of a trait, so that the optimal trait value changes unpredictably over time. Our mathematical model investigates how much variation is optimal in a trait. We expect specialists (low within-individual trait variation) to be favored in stable environments, with generalists (high trait variation) favored in more variable environments. We show that the answer depends on whether we look from the point of view of the individual or all individuals of the same genotype. If an individual does well in the short term, but its offspring all experience a different environment and therefore do badly, the genotype as a whole is in trouble, and will not be favored in the long term. One solution to this problem could be to produce offspring with different trait values, to ensure that at least some of the offspring do well no matter the environmental conditions they grow up in. This \\\"dont put all your eggs in one basket\\\" diversification strategy is well-known in some organisms, but how helpful is it if there is also some within-individual (i.e. generalist) trait variation? By answering these questions under various environmental scenarios, we link together many different concepts in evolutionary ecology and animal behavior, increasing our understanding about how organisms may cope with the current changes in environmental conditions around the world.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how gene expression programs are controlled requires identifying regulatory relationships between transcription factors and target genes. Gene regulatory networks are typically constructed from gene expression data acquired following genetic perturbation or environmental stimulus. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) captures the gene expression state of thousands of individual cells in a single experiment, offering advantages in combinatorial experimental design, large numbers of independent measurements, and accessing the interaction between the cell cycle and environmental responses that is hidden by population-level analysis of gene expression. To leverage these advantages, we developed a method for transcriptionally barcoding gene deletion mutants and performing scRNAseq in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). We pooled diverse genotypes in 11 different environmental conditions and determined their expression state by sequencing 38,285 individual cells. We developed, and benchmarked, a framework for learning gene regulatory networks from scRNAseq data that incorporates multitask learning and constructed a global gene regulatory network comprising 12,018 interactions. Our study establishes a general approach to gene regulatory network reconstruction from scRNAseq data that can be employed in any organism.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection and is a major public health problem with an estimated 1.7 billion persons infected worldwide. Clinical challenges in TB include the lack of a blood-based test for active disease, and the absence of prognostic biomarkers for early treatment response. Current blood based tests, such as QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT), are based on an IFN{gamma} readout following Mtb antigen stimulation. However, they do not distinguish active TB disease from asymptomatic Mtb infection. We hypothesized that the use of TruCulture, an improved immunomonitoring method for whole blood collection and immune stimulation, could improve the discrimination of active disease from latent Mtb infection. To test our hypothesis, we stimulated whole blood from active TB patients (before and after successful treatment), comparing them to asymptomatic latently infected individuals. Mtb-specific antigens (ESAT-6, CFP-10, TB7.7) and live bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) were used for TruCulture stimulation conditions, with direct comparison to QFT. Protein analyses were performed on the culture supernatants using ELISA and Luminex multi-analyte profiling. TruCulture showed an ability to discriminate active TB cases from latent controls (p < 0.0001, AUC = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.69-0.93) as compared to QFT (p = 0.47 AUC = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.40-0.72), based on an IFN{gamma} readout after Mtb antigen stimulation. The stratification of the two groups could be further improved by using the Mtb Ag/BCG IFN{gamma} ratio response (p < 0.0001, AUC = 0.918, 95% CI: 0.84-0.98). We also identified additional cytokines that distinguished latent infection from TB disease; and show that the primary differences between the TruCulture and QFT systems were a result of higher levels of non-specific innate immune activation in QFT tubes, due to the lack of a buffering solution in the latter. We conclude that TruCulture offers a next-generation solution for whole blood stimulation and immunomonitoring with the possibility to discriminate active and latently infected persons.",

    "abstract": "Successful decision-making requires learning expectations based on experienced outcomes. This learning should be calibrated according to the surprise associated with an outcome, but also to the statistical context dictating the most likely source of surprise. For example, when occasional changepoints are expected, surprising outcomes should be weighted heavily, demanding increased learning. In contrast, when signal corruption is expected to occur occasionally, surprising outcomes can suggest a corrupt signal that should be ignored by learning systems. Here we dissociate surprising outcomes from the degree to which they demand learning using a predictive inference task and computational modeling. We show that the updating P300, a stimulus-locked electrophysiological response previously associated with adjustments in learning behavior, does so conditionally on the source of surprise. Larger P300 signals predicted greater learning in a changing context, but predicted less learning in a context where surprise was indicative of a one-off outlier (oddball). The conditional predictive relationship between the P300 and learning behavior was persistent even after adjusting for known sources of learning rate variability. Our results suggest that the P300 provides a surprise signal that is interpreted by downstream learning processes differentially according to statistical context in order to appropriately calibrate learning across complex environments.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress and a disturbed cellular protein homeostasis (proteostasis) belong to the most important hallmarks of aging and of neurodegenerative disorders. The proteasomal and autophagic-lysosomal degradation pathways are key measures to maintain proteostasis. Here, we report that hippocampal cells selected for full adaptation and resistance to oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (oxidative stress-resistant cells, OxSR cells) showed a massive increase in the expression of components of the cellular autophagic-lysosomal network and a significantly higher overall autophagic activity. A comparative expression analysis revealed that distinct key regulators of autophagy are upregulated in OxSR cells. The observed adaptive autophagic response was found to be independent of the upstream autophagy regulator mTOR but is accompanied by a significant upregulation of further downstream components of the canonical autophagy network such as Beclin1, WIPI1 and the transmembrane ATG9 proteins. Interestingly, the expression of the HSP70 co-chaperone BAG3, mediator of BAG3-mediated selective macroautophagy and highly relevant for the clearance of aggregated proteins in cells was found to be increased in OxSR cells that were consequently able to effectively overcome proteotoxic stress. Overexpression of BAG3 in oxidative stress-sensitive HT22 wildtype cells partly established the vesicular phenotype and the enhanced autophagic flux seen in OxSR cells suggesting that BAG3 takes over a key part in the adaptation process. A full proteome analysis demonstrated additional changes in the expression of mitochondrial proteins, metabolic enzymes and different pathway regulators in OxSR cells as consequence of the adaptation to oxidative stress in addition to autophagy-related proteins. Taken together, this analysis revealed a wide variety of pathways and players that act as adaptive response to chronic redox stress in neuronal cells.",

Here, we present an analytical approach that uses summary-level data from cohort-based DNA methylation (DNAm) quantitative trait locus (mQTL) studies to predict PAIs. Using mQTL data from human peripheral blood (n=1,980), we predicted 34,797 PAIs which showed strong overlap with the chromatin contacts identified by previous experimental assays. The promoter-interacting DNAm sites were enriched in enhancers or near expression QTLs. Genes whose promoters were involved in PAIs were more actively expressed, and gene pairs with promoter-promoter interactions were enriched for co-expression. Integration of the predicted PAIs with GWAS data highlighted interactions among 601 DNAm sites associated with 15 complex traits. This study demonstrates the use of mQTL data to predict PAIs and provides insights into the role of PAIs in complex trait variation.",

However, it remains a challenge to identify a set of reliable and reproducible biomarkers across various gene expression platforms and laboratories for single sample diagnosis and prognosis. We address this need with our Data-Driven Reference (DDR) approach, which employs stably expressed housekeeping genes as references to eliminate platform-specific biases and non-biological variabilities. Our method identifies biomarkers with \\\"built-in\\\" features, and these features can be interpreted consistently regardless of profiling technology, which enable classification of single-sample independent of platforms. Validation with RNA-seq data of blood platelets shows that DDR achieves the superior performance in classification of six different tumor types as well as molecular target statuses (such as MET or HER2-positive, and mutant KRAS, EGFR or PIK3CA) with smaller sets of biomarkers. We demonstrate on the three microarray datasets that our method is capable of identifying robust biomarkers for subgrouping medulloblastoma samples with data perturbation due to different microarray platforms. In addition to identifying the majority of subgroup-specific biomarkers in Code-Set of nanoString, some potential new biomarkers for subgrouping medulloblastoma were detected by our method. Our results show that the DDR method contributes significantly to single-sample classification of disease and shed light on personalized medicine.",

    "abstract": "Muscle resident fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs), support muscle regeneration by releasing cytokines that stimulate the differentiation of myogenic stem cells. However, in non-physiological contexts (myopathies, atrophy, aging) FAPs cause fibrotic and fat infiltrations that impair muscle function. We set out to perform a fluorescence microscopy-based screening to identify compounds that perturb the differentiation trajectories of these multipotent stem cells. From a primary screen of 1120 FDA/EMA approved drugs, we identified 34 compounds as potential inhibitors of adipogenic differentiation of FAPs isolated from the murine model (mdx) of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The hit list from this screen was surprisingly enriched with compounds from the glucocorticoid (GCs) chemical class, drugs that are known to promote adipogenesis in vitro and in vivo. To shed light on these data, three GCs identified in our screening efforts were characterized by different approaches. We found that like dexamethasone, budesonide inhibits adipogenesis induced by insulin in subconfluent FAPs. However, both drugs have a proadipogenic impact when the adipogenic mix contains factors that increase the concentration of cAMP. Gene expression analysis demonstrated that treatment with glucocorticoids induces the transcription of Gilz/Tsc22d3, an inhibitor of the adipogenic master regulator PPAR{gamma}, only in anti-adipogenic conditions. Additionally, alongside their anti-adipogenic effect, GCs are shown to promote terminal differentiation of satellite cells. Both the anti-adipogenic and pro-myogenic effects are mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor and are not observed in the presence of receptor inhibitors. Steroid administration currently represents the standard treatment for DMD patients, the rationale being based on their anti-inflammatory effects. The findings presented here offer new insights on additional glucocorticoid effects on muscle stem cells that may affect muscle homeostasis and physiology.",

In this study, we simultaneously profiled both the DNA methylome and mRNA transcriptome from single DRG neurons at different ages under either control or peripheral nerve injury condition. We found that age-related expression changes in Notch signaling genes and methylation changes at Notch receptor binding sites are associated with the age-dependent decline in peripheral nerve regeneration potential. Moreover, selective hypomethylation of AP-1 complex binding sites on regeneration-associated gene (RAG) promoters coincides with RAG transcriptional upregulation after injury. Consistent with the findings that different subtypes of DRG neurons exhibit distinct methylome changes upon injury responses, in a hybrid CAST/Ei; C57BL/6 genetic background, we further observed allele-specific gene regulation and methylation changes for many RAGs after injury. We suggest that the genetic background determines distinct allele-specific DNA methylomes, which contribute to age-dependent regulation and neuronal subtype-specific injury-responses in different mouse strains.",

    "abstract": "Two key prerequisites for glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in Beta cells are the proximity of insulin granules to the plasma membrane and their anchoring or docking to the plasma membrane (PM). While recent evidence has indicated that both of these factors are altered in the context of diabetes, it is unclear what regulates localization of insulin and its interactions with the PM within single cells. Here we demonstrate that microtubule (MT) motor mediated transport dynamics have a critical role in regulating both factors. Super-resolution imaging shows that while the MT cytoskeleton resembles a random meshwork in the cells interior, MTs near the cells surface are preferentially aligned with the PM. Computational modeling demonstrates two consequences of this alignment. First, this structured MT network preferentially withdraws granules from the PM. Second, the binding and transport of insulin granules by MT motors prevents their stable anchoring to the PM. The MT cytoskeleton thus negatively regulates GSIS by both limiting the amount of insulin proximal to the PM and preventing/breaking interactions between the PM and the remaining nearby insulin. These results predict that altering MT structure in beta cells can be used to tune GSIS. Thus, our study points to a potential of an alternative therapeutic strategy for diabetes by targeting specific MT regulators.",

    "abstract": "Eight different data sets, covering the whole human genome are compared with regard to their genomic distribution. A close correlation between cytological detected chiasma and MLH1 immunofluorescence sites with the recombination density distribution from the HapMap project was found. Sites with a high probability of chromatid breakage after exposure to low and high ionization density radiations are often located inside common and rare Fragile Sites (FSs) indicating that the common Radiation-Induced Breakpoint sites (RIBs) may be a new kind of more local fragility. Furthermore, Oncogenes and other cancer-related genes are commonly located in regions with an increased probability of rearrangements during genomic recombination, or in regions with high probability of copy number changes, possibly since these processes may be involved in oncogene activation and cancer induction. An increased CpG density is linked to regions of high gene density to secure high fidelity reproduction and survival. To minimize cancer induction these genes are often located in regions of decreased recombination density and/or higher than average CpG density. Interestingly, copy number changes occur predominantly at common RIBs and/or FSs at least for breast cancers with poor prognosis and they decrease weakly but significantly in regions with increasing recombination density and CpG density. It is compelling that all these datasets are influenced by the cells handling of double strand breaks and more generally DNA damage on its genome. In fact, the DNA repair genes are systematically avoiding regions with a high recombination density. This may be a consequence of natural selection, as they need to be intact to accurately handle repairable DNA lesions.",

Many tumors express anti-inflammatory factors that deactivate the local immune response or recruit peripheral macrophages into pro-tumor roles. Because of this, effective and specific ways of activating macrophages into anti-tumor phenotypes is highly desirable for immunotherapy purposes. Here, the use of a small molecule TLR agonist as a macrophage activator for anti-cancer therapy is reported. This compound, referred to as PBI1, demonstrated unique activation characteristics and expression patterns compared to treatment with LPS, through activation of TLR4. Furthermore, PBI1 treatment resulted in anti-tumor immune behavior, enhancing macrophage phagocytic efficiency five-fold versus non-treated macrophages. Additive effects were observed via use of a complementary strategy (anti-CD47 antibody), resulting in [~]10-fold enhancement of phagocytosis, suggesting this small molecule approach could be used in conjunction with other therapeutics.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=88 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/581710_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (26K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c4aa23org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7e1928org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a5be7borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17c9d5e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen causing multiple pathologies, from cutaneous lesions to life-threatening sepsis. Although neutrophils contribute to immunity against S. aureus, multiple lines of evidence suggest that these phagocytes can provide an intracellular niche for staphylococcal dissemination. However, the mechanism of neutrophil subversion by intracellular S. aureus remains unknown. Targeting of intracellular pathogens by autophagy is recognised as an important component of host innate immunity, but whether autophagy is beneficial or detrimental to S. aureus-infected hosts remains controversial. Here, using larval zebrafish we show that S. aureus is rapidly decorated by the autophagy marker Lc3 following engulfment by macrophages and neutrophils. Upon phagocytosis by neutrophils, Lc3-positive, non-acidified spacious phagosomes are formed. This response is dependent on phagocyte NADPH oxidase as both cyba knockdown and diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) treatment inhibited Lc3 decoration of phagosomes. Importantly, NADPH oxidase inhibition diverted neutrophil S. aureus processing into tight acidified vesicles, which resulted in increased host resistance to the infection. Some intracellular bacteria within neutrophils were also tagged by p62-GFP fusion protein and loss of p62 impaired host defence. Taken together, we have shown that intracellular handling of S. aureus by neutrophils is best explained by Lc3-associated phagocytosis (LAP), which appears to provide an intracellular niche for bacterial pathogenesis, while the selective autophagy receptor p62 is host-protective. The antagonistic roles of LAP and p62-mediated pathways in S. aureus-infected neutrophils may explain the conflicting reports relating to anti-staphylococcal autophagy and provide new insights for therapeutic strategies against antimicrobial resistant staphylococci.",

    "abstract": "Cholesterol is one of the most essential lipids in eukaryotic cell membranes. However, acute and selective manipulation of membrane cholesterol remains challenging. Here, we report that graphene nanoflakes (GNFs) insert into the plasma membrane and directly interact with cholesterol, resulting in acute cholesterol enrichment - and thus structural and functional changes. Using two representative cell preparations, we explore the utility of GNFs in modifying cell communication pathways sensitive to membrane cholesterol. In fibroblasts, GNFs enhance ATP-induced intracellular Ca2+-release by allosteric facilitation of P2Y receptors, a subtype of G protein-coupled receptors, in a cholesterol-dependent manner. In neurons, which possess higher membrane cholesterol levels than most cell types, GNFs further increase cholesterol. Consequently, GNFs change membrane fluidity, especially at synaptic boutons, and potentiate neurotransmitter release by accelerating synaptic vesicle turnover. Together, our results provide a molecular explanation for graphenes cellular impacts and demonstrate its potential for membrane-oriented engineering of cell signaling.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional regulators, including the cohesin complex member STAG2, are recurrently mutated in cancer. The role of STAG2 in gene regulation, hematopoiesis, and tumor suppression remains unresolved. We show Stag2 deletion in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) results in altered hematopoietic function, increased self-renewal, and impaired differentiation. ChIP-sequencing revealed that while Stag2 and Stag1 can bind the same loci, a component of Stag2 binding sites are unoccupied by Stag1 even in Stag2-deficient HSPCs. While concurrent loss of Stag2 and Stag1 abrogated hematopoiesis, Stag2 loss alone decreased chromatin accessibility and transcription of lineage-specification genes, including Ebf1 and Pax5, leading to blunted HSPC commitment to the B-cell lineage. Our data illustrate a role for Stag2 in transformation and transcriptional dysregulation distinct from its shared role with Stag1 in chromosomal segregation.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryStag1 rescues topologically associated domains in the absence of Stag2, but cannot restore chromatin architecture required for hematopoietic lineage commitment",

    "abstract": "Addition and removal of presynaptic terminals reconfigures neuronal circuits of the mammalian neocortex, but little is known about how this presynaptic structural plasticity is controlled. Since mitochondria can regulate presynaptic function, we investigated whether the presence of axonal mitochondria relates to structural plasticity of presynaptic boutons in mouse neocortex. We found that the overall density of axonal mitochondria did not appear to influence loss and gain of boutons. However, positioning of mitochondria at individual presynaptic sites did relate to increased stability of those boutons. In line with this, synaptic localisation of mitochondria increased as boutons aged and showed differing patterns of localisation at en passant and terminaux boutons. These results suggest that mitochondria accumulate locally at boutons over time to increase bouton stability.",

    "abstract": "Tumor angiogenesis is regulated by pro- and anti-angiogenic factors. Anti-angiogenic agents target the interconnected network of angiogenic factors to inhibit neovascularization, which subsequently impedes tumor growth. Due to the complexity of this network, optimizing anti-angiogenic cancer treatments requires detailed knowledge at a systems level. In this study, we constructed a tumor tissue-based model to better understand how the angiogenic network is regulated by opposing mediators at the extracellular level. We consider the network comprised of two pro-angiogenic factors: vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2), and two anti-angiogenic factors: thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) and platelet factor 4 (PF4). The models prediction of angiogenic factors distribution in tumor tissue reveals the localization of different factors and indicates the angiogenic state of the tumor. We explored how the distributions are affected by the secretion of the pro- and anti-angiogenic factors, illustrating how the angiogenic network is regulated in the extracellular space. Interestingly, we identified a counterintuitive result that the secretion of the anti-angiogenic factor PF4 can enhance pro-angiogenic signaling by elevating the levels of the interstitial and sur-face-level pro-angiogenic species. This counterintuitive situation is pertinent to the clinical setting, such as the release of anti-angiogenic factors in platelet activation or the administration of exogenous PF4 for anti-angiogenic therapy. Our study provides mechanistic insights into this counterintuitive result and highlights the role of heparan sulfate proteoglycans in regulating the interactions between angiogenic factors. This work complements previous studies aimed at understanding formation of angiogenic complexes in tumor tissue and helps in the development of anti-cancer strategies targeting angiogenesis.",

    "abstract": "MeCP2 is an abundant protein, involved in transcriptional repression by binding to CG and non-CG methylated DNA. However, MeCP2 might also function as a transcription activator as MeCP2 is found bound to sparsely methylated promoters of actively expressed genes. Furthermore, Attachment Region Binding Protein (ARBP), the chicken ortholog of MeCP2, has been reported to bind to Matrix/scaffold attachment regions (MARs/SARs) DNA with an unmethylated 5-CAC/GTG-3 consensus sequence. In this study, we investigated how MeCP2 recognizes unmethylated 5-CAC/GTG-3 motif containing DNA by binding and structural studies. We found that MeCP2-MBD binds to MARs DNA with a comparable binding affinity to mCG DNA, and the MeCP2-CAC/GTG complex structure revealed that MeCP2 residues R111 and R133 form base-specific interactions with the GTG motif. For comparison, we also determined crystal structures of the MeCP2-MBD bound to mCG and mCAC/GTG DNA, respectively. Together, these crystal structures illustrate the adaptability of the MeCP2-MBD toward the GTG motif as well as the mCG DNA, and also provide structural basis of a biological role of MeCP2 as a transcription activator and its disease implications in Rett syndrome.",
