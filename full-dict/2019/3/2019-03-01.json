    "abstract": "Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are often impaired in their ability to cope with and process multisensory information, which may contribute to some of the social and communicative deficits that are prevalent in this population. Amelioration of such deficits in adolescence has been observed for ecologically-relevant stimuli such as speech. However, it is not yet known if this recovery generalizes to the processing of nonsocial stimuli such as more basic beeps and flashes, typically used in cognitive neuroscience research. We hypothesize that engagement of different neural processes and lack of environmental exposure to such artificial stimuli leads to protracted developmental trajectories in both neurotypical (NT) individuals and individuals with ASD, thus delaying the age at which we observe this \"catch up\". Here, we test this hypothesis using a bisensory detection task by measuring human response times to randomly presented auditory, visual and audiovisual stimuli. By measuring the behavioral gain afforded by an audiovisual signal, we show that the multisensory deficit previously reported in children with ASD recovers in adulthood by the mid-twenties. In addition, we examine the effects of switching between sensory modalities and show that teenagers with ASD incur less of a behavioral cost than their NT peers. Computational modelling reveals that multisensory information interacts according to different rules in children and adults, and that sensory evidence is weighted differently too. In ASD, weighting of sensory information and allocation of attention during multisensory processing differs to that of NT individuals. Based on our findings, we propose a theoretical framework of multisensory development in NT and ASD individuals.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that attention can facilitate performance by top-down biasing processing of task-relevant information in advance. Recent findings from behavioral studies suggest that distractor inhibition is not under similar direct control, but strongly dependent on expectations derived from previous experience. Yet, how expectations about distracting information influence distractor inhibition at the neural level remains unclear. The current study addressed this outstanding question in three experiments in which search displays with repeating distractor or target locations across trials allowed observers to learn which location to selectively suppress or boost. Behavioral findings demonstrated that both distractor and target location learning resulted in more efficient search, as indexed by faster response times. Crucially, benefits of distractor learning were observed without target location foreknowledge, unaffected by the number of possible target locations, and could not be explained by priming alone. To determine how distractor location expectations facilitated performance, we applied a spatial encoding model to EEG data to reconstruct activity in neural populations tuned to the distractor or target location. Target location learning increased neural tuning to the target location in advance, indicative of preparatory biasing. This sensitivity increased after target presentation. By contrast, distractor expectations did not change preparatory spatial tuning. Instead, distractor expectations reduced distractor-specific processing, as reflected in the disappearance of the Pd ERP component, a neural marker of distractor inhibition, and decreased decoding accuracy. These findings suggest that the brain may no longer process expected distractors as distractors, once it has learned they can safely be ignored.\\n\\nSignificance statementWe constantly try hard to ignore conspicuous events that distract us from our current goals. Surprisingly, and in contrast to dominant attention theories, ignoring distracting, but irrelevant events does not seem to be as flexible as is focusing our attention on those same aspects. Instead, distractor suppression appears to strongly rely on learned, context-dependent expectations. Here, we investigated how learning about upcoming distractors changes distractor processing and directly contrasted the underlying neural dynamics to target learning. We show that while target learning enhanced anticipatory sensory tuning, distractor learning only modulated reactive suppressive processing. These results suggest that expected distractors may no longer be considered distractors by the brain once it has learned that they can safely be ignored.",

    "abstract": "Topographic sensory maps are a prominent feature of the adult primate brain. Here, we asked whether topographic representations of the environment are fundamental to early development. Using fMRI, we find that the newborn somato-motor system, spanning frontoparietal cortex and subcortex, comprises multiple topographic body representations. The organization of these large-scale body maps was indistinguishable from those in adults and already exhibited features stereotypical of adult maps. Finer-scale differentiation of individual fingers increased over the first two years, suggesting that topographic representations are refined during early development. Last, we found that somato-motor representations were unchanged in two visually impaired monkeys who relied entirely on touch for interacting with their environment, demonstrating that massive shifts in early sensory experience in an otherwise anatomically intact brain are not sufficient for driving cross-modal plasticity. We propose that a topographic scaffolding is present at birth that both directs and constrains experience-driven modifications throughout sensory systems.",

    "abstract": "Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA) is a technique that promises to comprehensively detect and quantify all peptides above an instruments limit of detection. Several software tools to analyze DIA data have been developed in recent years. However, several challenges still remain, like confidently identifying peptides, defining integration boundaries, dealing with interference for selected transitions, and scoring and filtering of peptide signals in order to control false discovery rates. In practice, a visual inspection of the signals is still required, which is impractical with large datasets. Avant-garde is a new tool to refine DIA (and PRM) by removing interfered transitions, adjusting integration boundaries and scoring peaks to control the FDR. Unlike other tools where MS runs are scored independently from each other, Avant-garde uses a novel data-driven scoring strategy. DIA signals are refined by learning from the data itself, using all measurements in all samples together to achieve the best optimization. We evaluated the performances of Avant-garde with a calibrated sample using spiked-in standards in a complex background, a phospho-enriched dataset (Abelin et al, 2016), and two complex hybrid proteome samples for benchmarking DIA software tools. The results clearly showed that Avant-garde is capable of improving the selectivity, accuracy, and reproducibility of the quantification results in very complex biological matrices. We have further shown that it can evaluate the suitability of a peak to be used for quantification reaching the same levels of selectivity, accuracy, and reproducibility obtained with manual validation.",

We describe an evolutionary pathway in fungi where a new transcriptional circuit (a-specific gene repression by Mat2) evolved by coding changes in an ancient master regulator, followed millions of years later by cis-regulatory sequence changes in the genes of its future regulon. We discerned this order of events by analyzing a group of species in which the coding changes in the regulator are present, but the cis-regulatory changes in the target genes are not. In this group we show that the coding changes became necessary for the regulators deeply conserved function and were therefore preserved. We propose that the changes first arose without altering the overall function of the regulator (although changing the details of its mechanism) and were later co-opted to \"jump start\" the formation of the new circuit.",

    "abstract": "Platinum and palladium are much sought-after metals of global critical importance in terms of abundance and availability. At the nano-scale these metals are of even higher value due to their catalytic abilities for industrial applications. Desulfovibrio alaskensis is able to capture ionic forms of both of these metals, reduce them, and synthesize elemental nanoparticles. Despite this ability very little is known about the biological pathways involved in the formation of these nanoparticles. Proteomic analysis of D. alaskensis in response to platinum and palladium has highlighted those proteins involved in both the reductive pathways and the wider stress-response system. A core set of 13 proteins was found in both treatments and consisted of proteins involved in metal transport and reduction. There were also 7 proteins specific to either platinum or palladium. Over-expression of one of these platinum-specific genes, a NiFe hydrogenase small subunit (Dde_2137), resulted in the formation of larger nanoparticles. This study improves our understanding of the pathways involved in the metal resistance mechanism of Desulfovibrio and informs how we can tailor the bacterium for nanoparticle production, enhancing its application as a bioremediation tool and as way to capture contaminant metals from the environment.\n\nImportanceBacteria, in particularly D. alaskensis, represent a biological and greener way to capture high value metals such as platinum group metals from environmental and industrial waste streams. The recovery of these metals in nanoparticle forms adds extra value to this process as they can be used in a variety of different industrial applications as they have exceptional catalytic capabilities. D. alaskensis ability to do this, has been widely reported, though very little is understood about the underlying protein and genetic components. It is by understanding the biological basis of this capability that we can further improve and adapt this bacterium to be better at bioremediation and to control its ability to do so.",

    "abstract": "Histones are a principal constituent of chromatin in eukaryotes and fundamental to our understanding of eukaryotic gene regulation. In archaea, histones are phylogenetically widespread, often highly abundant, but not universal: several archaeal lineages have lost histone genes from their coding repertoire. What prompted or facilitated these losses and how archaea without histones organize their chromatin remains largely unknown. Here, we use micrococcal nuclease digestion followed by high-throughput sequencing (MNase-Seq) to elucidate primary chromatin architecture in an archaeon without histones, the acido-thermophilic archaeon Thermoplasma acidophilum. We confirm and extend prior results showing that T. acidophilum harbours a HU family protein, HTa, that is highly expressed and protects a sizeable fraction of the genome from MNase digestion. Charting HTa-based chromatin architecture across the growth cycle and comparing it to that of three histone-encoding archaea (Methanothermus fervidus, Thermococcus kodakarensis and Haloferax volcanii), we then present evidence that HTa is an archaeal histone analog. HTa-protected fragments are GC-rich, display histone-like mono- and dinucleotide patterns around a conspicuous dyad, exhibit relatively invariant positioning throughout the growth cycle, and show archaeal histone-like oligomerization dynamics. Our results suggest that HTa, a DNA-binding protein of bacterial origin, has converged onto an architectural role filled by histones in other archaea.",

    "abstract": "To understand how protein function changes upon an allosteric perturbation, such as ligand binding and mutation, significant progress in characterizing allosteric network from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations has been made. However, determining which amino acid(s) play an essential role in the propagation of signals may prove challenging, even when the location of the source and sink is known for a protein or protein complex. This challenge is mainly due to the large fluctuations in protein dynamics that cause instability of the network topology within a single trajectory or between multiple replicas. To solve this problem, we introduce the current-flow betweenness scheme, originated from electrical network theory, to protein dynamical network analysis. To demonstrate the benefit of this new method, we chose a prototypic allosteric enzyme (IGPS or HisH-HisF dimer) as our benchmark system. Using multiple replicas of simulations and multiple network topology comparison metrics (edge ranking, path length, and node frequency), we show that the current-flow betweenness provides a significant improvement in the convergence of the allosteric networks. The improved stability of the network topology allows us to generate a delta-network between the apo and holo forms of the protein. We illustrated that the delta-network is a more rigorous way to capture the subtle changes in the networks that would otherwise be neglected by comparing node usage frequencies alone. We have also investigated the use of a linear smoothing function to improve the stability of the contact map. The methodology presented here is general and may be applied to other topology and weighting schemes. We thus conclude that, for determining protein signaling pathways between the pair(s) of source and sink, multiple MD simulation replicas are necessary and the current-flow betweenness scheme introduced here provides a more robust approach than the geodesic scheme based on correlation edge weighting.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=79 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/565457v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@54260corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8e1043org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cda004org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c485cb_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG For Table of Contents Only\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "The early and late stages of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication are orchestrated by the capsid (CA) protein, which self-assembles into a conical protein shell during viral maturation. Small molecule drugs known as capsid inhibitors (CIs) impede the highly-regulated activity of CA. Intriguingly, a few CIs, such as PF-3450074 (PF74) and GS-CA1, exhibit effects at multiple stages of the viral lifecycle at effective concentrations in the pM to nM regimes, while the majority of CIs target a single stage of the viral lifecycle and are effective at nM to {micro}M concentrations. In this work, we use coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that enable CIs to have such curious broad-spectrum activity. Our quantitatively analyzed findings show that CIs can have a profound impact on the hierarchical self-assembly of CA by perturbing the population of small CA oligomers. The self-assembly process is accelerated by the emergence of alternative assembly pathways that favor the rapid incorporation of CA pentamers, and leads to increased structural pleomorphism of mature capsids. Two relevant phenotypes are observed: (1) eccentric capsid formation that may fail to encase the viral genome and (2) rapid disassembly of the capsid, which express at late and early stages of infection, respectively. Finally, our study emphasizes the importance of adopting a dynamical perspective on inhibitory mechanisms and provides a basis for the design of future therapeutics that are effective at low stoichiometric ratios of drug to protein.",

    "abstract": "Fires shape the biogeochemistry and functioning of many ecosystems, but fire frequencies are changing across large areas of the globe. Frequent fires can change soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) storage through both \"top-down\" pathways, by altering inputs through shifting plant composition and biomass, and \"bottom-up\" ones, by altering losses through decomposition and turnover of soil organic matter. However, the relative importance of these different pathways and the degree to which they regulate ecosystem responses to decades of changing fire frequencies is uncertain. Here, we sampled soils and plant communities in four North American and African sites spanning tropical savanna, temperate coniferous savanna, temperate broadleaf savanna, and temperate coniferous forest that each contained multiple plots repeatedly burned for 33-61 years and nearby plots that were protected from fire over the same period. The sites varied markedly in temperature, precipitation, species composition, fire history and soil chemistry; thus they represent a broad test for the generality of fire impacts on biogeochemical cycling. For all four sites, bulk soil C and N by were 25-180% higher in unburned vs. frequently burned plots, with greater soil losses occurring in areas with greater declines in tree cover and biomass inputs into soils. Fire reduced the activity of soil extracellular enzymes that hydrolyze labile C and N from soil organic matter by two- to ten-fold, whereas tree cover was the predominant control on the oxidation of recalcitrant C compounds. C-acquisition enzyme activity tended to decline with decreasing soil N, suggesting that N losses may contribute to limited decomposition, buffering systems against increased losses of soil C with fire. In conclusion, variability in how fire alters soil C and N across ecosystems can be explained partly by fire-driven changes in tree cover and biomass, but the slower turnover of organic matter we observed may offset some of the reduction of C inputs from plants after fire.",

    "abstract": "RationaleRecombination suppression in sex chromosomes and mating type loci can lead to degeneration due to reduced selection efficacy and Mullers ratchet effects. However, genetic exchange in the form of non-crossover gene conversions may still take place within crossover-suppressed regions. Recent work has found evidence that gene conversion may explain the low levels of allelic differentiation in the dimorphic mating type locus (MT) of the isogamous alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. However, no one has tested whether gene conversion is sufficient to avoid the degeneration of functional sequence within MT.\n\nMethodsHere, we calculate levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) across MT as a proxy for recombination rate and investigate its relationship to patterns of population genetic variation and the efficacy of selection in the region.\n\nResultsWe find that levels of LD predict selection efficacy across MT, and that purifying selection is stronger in shared genes than MT-limited genes to the point of being equivalent to that of autosomal genes.\n\nConclusionsWe argue that isogamous systems without secondary sexual characteristics exhibit reduced selective pressure to differentiate sex chromosomes, and that recombination via gene conversion plays an important role in both reducing differentiation and preventing degeneration of crossover suppressed mating type loci.",

Detailed phylogenetic analysis suggests that duplications from which TRPV5 and TRPV6 originated occurred independently in the ancestors of mammals, sauropsids, amphibians, and chondrichthyans. Coincident with the conquest of land and the physiological changes needed to maintain calcium homeostasis, our expression analyses suggest a change in the expression pattern from gills to kidney. Within amniotes, we identified a traceable sequence signature of three amino acids at the amino-terminal intracellular region that correlates well with both of the duplication events and the phenotype of fast inactivation observed in TRPV6 channels. Electrophysiological recordings and mutagenesis suggest that calcium-induced fast inactivation is an evolutionary innovation that emerged independently from each duplication event. Simulations of molecular dynamics suggest that calcium-induced channel rearrangements are important modulatory regions of TRP channels.",

    "abstract": "Bleomycin is a powerful chemotherapeutic drug used to treat a variety of cancers. However, individual patients vary in their responses to bleomycin. The identification of genetic differences that underlie this response variation could improve treatment outcomes by tailoring bleomycin dosages to each patient. We used the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans to identify genetic determinants of bleomycin-response differences by performing linkage mapping on recombinants derived from a cross between the laboratory strain (N2) and a wild strain (CB4856). This approach identified a small genomic region on chromosome V that underlies bleomycin-response variation. Using near-isogenic lines and strains with CRISPR-Cas9 mediated deletions and allele replacements, we discovered that a novel nematode-specific gene (scb-1) is required for bleomycin resistance. Although the mechanism by which this gene causes variation in bleomycin responses is unknown, we suggest that a rare variant present in the CB4856 strain might cause differences in the potential stress-response function of scb-1 between the N2 and CB4856 strains, thereby leading to differences in bleomycin resistance.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal DNA methylation has been described in human inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). As other complex diseases, IBD results from the balance between genetic predisposition and environmental exposures. As such, DNA methylation may be placed as an effector of both, genetic susceptibility variants and/or environmental signals such as cytokine exposure. We attempted to discern between these two non-excluding possibilities by performing a meta-analysis of DNA methylation data in intestinal epithelial cells of IBD and control samples. We identified abnormal DNA methylation at different levels: deviation from mean methylation signals at site and region levels, and differential variability. A fraction of such changes are associated with genetic polymorphisms linked to IBD susceptibility. In addition, by comparing with another intestinal inflammatory condition (i.e. celiac disease) we propose that aberrant DNA methylation can also be the result of unspecific processes such as chronic inflammation. Our characterization suggests that IBD methylomes combine intrinsic and extrinsic responses in intestinal epithelial cells, and could point to knowledge-based biomarkers of IBD detection and progression.\n\nGraphical AbstractConceptual representation of the study. Using a meta-analysis strategy we identified differentially methylated positions or regions (DMP/DMR) in IBD. Our assumption is that gene expression changes (IBD phenotype) take place downstream of DNA methylation. In turn, abnormal DNA methylation can be explained by a direct effect of inflammatory cytokines (\"signaling\") and/or the result of a genetic polymorphism (SNP). SNP-DMP associations are called methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL).\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=140 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/565200v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (19K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b9fc96org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7619c5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1961352org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ce9d84_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHeterogeneity in the immune response to parasite infection is mediated in part by differences in host genetics, sex, and age group. In neonates and infants, ongoing immunological maturation often results in increased susceptibility to infection and variable responses to drug treatment, increasing the risk of complications. Even though significant age-specific effects on host cytokine responses to Plasmodium falciparum infection have been identified, age effects on uncomplicated malaria infection and antimalarial treatment remain poorly understood.\n\nMethodsIn samples of whole blood from a cohort of naturally infected malaria-positive individuals in Malawi (n=63 total; 34 infants <2 years old, 29 adults >18 years old), we assessed blood cytokine levels and characterized monocyte and dendritic cell frequencies at two timepoints: acute infection, and four weeks post antimalarial treatment. We modeled the effects of age group, sex, and timepoint, and evaluated the role of these factors on infection and treatment outcomes.\n\nResultsRegardless of treatment timepoint, in our population age was significantly associated with overall blood hemoglobin, which was higher in adults, and plasma nitric oxide, IL-10, and TNF- levels, which were higher in infants. We found a significant effect of age on the hemoglobin treatment response, whereby after treatment, levels increased in infants and decreased in adults. Furthermore, we observed significant age-specific effects on treatment response for overall parasite load, IFN-{gamma} and IL-12(p40), and these effects were sex-dependent. We uncovered significant age effects on the overall levels and treatment response of myeloid dendritic cell frequencies. In addition, within each age group, we found continuous age effects on gametocyte levels (Pfs16), TNF-, and nitric oxide.\n\nConclusionsIn a clinical study of infants and adults experiencing natural malaria infection and receiving antimalarial treatment, we identified age-specific signatures of infection and treatment responses in peripheral blood. We describe host markers that may indicate, and potentially mediate, differential post-treatment outcomes for malaria in infants versus adults.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance is a globally recognized public health risk. High incidence of antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in solid organic waste necessitates the development of effective treatment strategies. The objective of this study was to assess ARG diversity and abundance as well as the relationship between resistome and microbial community structure during anaerobic co-digestion (AD) of food waste, paper and cardboard. A lab-scale solid-state AD system consisting of six sequentially fed leach beds (each with a solids retention time of 42 days) and an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor was operated under mesophilic conditions continuously for 88 weeks to successfully treat municipal organic waste and produce biogas. A total of ten samples from digester feed and digestion products were collected for microbial community analysis including SSU rRNA gene sequencing, total community metagenome sequencing and quantitative PCR. Taxonomic analyses revealed that AD changed the taxonomic profile of the microbial community: digester feed was dominated by bacterial and eukaryotic taxa while anaerobic digestate possessed a large proportion of archaea mainly belonging to the methanogenic genus Methanosaeta. ARGs were identified in all samples with significantly higher richness and relative abundance per 16S rRNA gene in digester feed compared to digestion products. Multidrug resistance was the most abundant ARG type. AD was not able to completely remove ARGs as shown by ARGs detected in digestion products. Using metagenomic assembly and binning we detected potential bacterial hosts of ARGs in digester feed, that included Erwinia, Bifidobacteriaceae, Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus.\n\nIMPORTANCESolid organic waste is a significant source of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) (1) and effective treatment strategies are urgently required to limit the spread of antimicrobial resistance. Here we studied the antibiotic resistome and microbial community structure within an anaerobic digester treating a mixture of food waste, paper and cardboard. We observed a significant shift in microbial community composition and a reduction in ARG diversity and abundance after 6 weeks of digestion. We identified the host organisms of some of the ARGs including potentially pathogenic as well as non-pathogenic bacteria, and we detected mobile genetic elements required for horizontal gene transfer. Our results indicate that the process of sequential solid-state anaerobic digestion of food waste, paper and cardboard tested herein provides a significant reduction in the relative abundance of ARGs per 16S rRNA gene.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis, the pathological result of infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), represents a massive and persistent global health burden with vast overrepresentation in regions with poor access to healthcare. This pathogen survives intracellularly within lung macrophages, and has been shown to extensively reprogram the host lipid compartment to the effect of enhanced survival and immune evasion. Sphingolipids are a class of lipid with extensive functions in a wide variety of cellular contexts, including apoptosis, autophagy, stress response, and inflammation. There remains a significant knowledge gap surrounding the lipid-mediated interactions between M.tb and its host. Our investigation aims to explore the mechanisms through which M.tb harnesses host-derived sphingolipids to gain entry to the host and to survive intracellularly. To this end, we use chemical and genetic perturbations of the sphingolipid de novo synthesis pathway and fluorescence microscopy to show that sphingolipids are required for efficient phagocytosis of M.tb. We furthermore show that the dynamics of phosphoinositides at the phagosomal synapse are perturbed upon blockade of sphingolipid synthesis. Finally, we demonstrate that perturbing the homeostasis of a specific sphingolipid (sphingomyelin) through both enrichment and depletion at the cell surface reduces M.tb uptake. This work represents a first step in building comprehensive knowledge of the mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions in M.tb, and demonstrates a cohort of methodologies that may be applied to a variety of pathogenic contexts.",

The mechanisms by which low-dose antibiotics induce large yet highly variable changes in gut communities have remained elusive. We therefore investigated the impact of antibiotics on intestinal bacteria using larval zebrafish, whose experimental tractability enables high-resolution in vivo examination of response dynamics. Live imaging revealed that sublethal doses of the common antibiotic ciprofloxacin lead to severe drops in bacterial abundance, coincident with changes in spatial organization that increase susceptibility to intestinal expulsion. Strikingly, our data can be mapped onto a physical model of living gels that links bacterial aggregation and expulsion to nonequilibrium abundance dynamics, providing a framework for predicting the impact of antibiotics on the intestinal microbiome.",

Increasing evidence suggests that targeting both integrins simultaneously with antagonists is more effective in cancer therapy because of concerns about resistance and paradoxical promotion of tumor growth with use of agents highly selective for a single integrin. Engineered Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-containing 3.5 kDa cysteine-knot proteins (knottins 2.5F and 2.5D) are attractive drug candidates due to their exceptional structural stability and high affinity binding to certain integrins. 2.5F binds both V{beta}3 and 5{beta}1, whereas 2.5D is V{beta}3-selective. To elucidate the structural basis of integrin selection, we determined the structures of 2.5F and 2.5D both as apo-proteins and in complex with V{beta}3. These data, combined with MD simulations and mutational studies, revealed a critical role of two V{beta}3-specific residues in the vicinity of the metal ion dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) in promoting an V{beta}3-induced fit of 2.5D. In contrast, conformational selection accounted for the specificity of 2.5F to both integrins. These data provide new insights into the structural basis of integrin-ligand binding specificity, and could help in development of integrin-targeted therapeutics.",

During quiescence and slow wave sleep, bouts of synchronized activity represent long trajectories called replays, which are well-established in place cells and have been recently reported in grid cells. Theta sequences and replay are hypothesized to facilitate many cognitive functions, but their underlying mechanisms are unknown. A leading mechanism proposed for grid cell formation is the continuous attractor network. We demonstrate that this established architecture naturally produces theta sequences and replay as distinct consequences of modulating external input. Driving inhibitory interneurons at the theta frequency causes attractor bumps to oscillate in speed and size, which gives rise to theta sequences and phase precession, respectively. Decreasing input drive to all neurons produces traveling wavefronts of activity that are decoded as replays.",

    "abstract": "Older adults exhibit greater multisensory response time (RT) facilitation by violating the race model more than younger adults; this is commonly interpreted as an enhancement in perception. Older adults typically exhibit wider temporal binding windows (TBWs) and points of subjective simultaneity (PSS) that are farther from true simultaneity as compared to younger adults when simultaneity judgment (SJ) and temporal order judgment (TOJ) tasks are utilized; this is commonly interpreted as an impairment in perception. Here we explore the relation between the three tasks in younger and older adults in order to better understand the underlying mechanisms that subserve audiovisual multisensory temporal processing. Our results confirm previous reports showing that audiovisual RT, TBWs and PSSs change with age, and we show for the first time a significant positive relation between the magnitude of race model violation in younger adults as a function of the PSS obtained from the audiovisual TOJ task with (r: 0.49, p: 0.007), that is absent among the elderly (r: 0.13, p: 0.58). Furthermore, we find no evidence for the relation between race model violation as a function of the PSS obtained from the audiovisual SJ task in both younger (r: -0.01, p: 0.94) and older adults (r: 0.1, p: 0.66).

Oxidative stress which has been implicated to the pathogenesis of diabetes complication (e.g., cardiovascular event) were, however, poorly understood. We report a novel approach to rapidly manipulate the redox chemistry (in a single drop) of blood using point-of-care NMR system. We exploit the fact that oxidative stress changes the subtle molecular motion of water-proton in the blood, and thus inducing a measurable shift in magnetic resonance relaxation properties. This technique is label-free and the whole assays finish in a few minutes.

    "abstract": "Short peptides are uniquely versatile building blocks for self-assembly. Supramolecular peptide assemblies can be used to construct functional hydrogel biomaterials--an attractive approach for neural tissue engineering. Here, we report a new class of short, five-residue peptides that form hydrogels with nanofiber structures. Using rheology and spectroscopy, we describe how sequence variations, pH, and peptide concentration alter the mechanical properties of our pentapeptide hydrogels. We find that this class of seven unmodified peptides forms robust hydrogels from 0.2-20 kPa at low weight percent (less than 3 wt. %) in cell culture media, and undergoes shear-thinning and rapid self-healing. The peptides self-assemble into long fibrils with sequence-dependent fibrillar morphologies. These fibrils exhibit a unique twisted ribbon shape, as visualized by TEM and Cryo-EM imaging, with diameters in the low tens of nanometers and periodicities similar to amyloid fibrils. Experimental gelation behavior corroborates our molecular dynamics simulations, which demonstrate peptide assembly behavior, an increase in {beta}-sheet content, and patterns of variation in solvent accessibility. Our Rapidly Assembling Pentapeptides for Injectable Delivery (RAPID) hydrogels are syringe-injectable and support cytocompatible encapsulation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), as well as their proliferation and three-dimensional process extension. Furthermore, RAPID gels protect OPCs from mechanical membrane disruption and acute loss of viability when ejected from a syringe needle, highlighting the protective capability of the hydrogel as potential cell carriers for trans-plantation therapies. The tunable mechanical and structural properties of these supramolecular assemblies are shown to be permissive to cell expansion and remodeling, making this hydrogel system suitable as an injectable material for cell delivery and tissue engineering applications.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in genomic technologies have generated large-scale protein-DNA interaction data and open chromatic regions for multiple plant species. To predict condition specific gene regulatory networks using these data, we developed the Condition Specific Regulatory network inference engine (ConSReg), which combines heterogeneous genomic data using sparse linear model followed by feature selection and stability selection to select key regulatory genes. Using Arabidopsis as a model system, we constructed maps of gene regulation under more than 50 experimental conditions including abiotic stresses, cell type-specific expression, and stress responses in individual cell types. Our results show that ConSReg accurately predicted gene expressions (average auROC of 0.84) across multiple testing datasets. We found that, (1) including open chromatin information from ATAC-seq data significantly improves the performance of ConSReg across all tested datasets; (2) choice of negative training samples and length of promoter regions are two key factors that affect model performance. We applied ConSReg to Arabidopsis single cell RNA-seq data of two root cell types (endodermis and cortex) and identified five regulators in two root cell types. Four out of the five regulators have additional experimental evidence to support their roles in regulating gene expression in Arabidopsis roots. By comparing regulatory maps in abiotic stress responses and cell type-specific experiments, we revealed that transcription factors that regulate tissue levels abiotic stresses tend to also regulate stress responses in individual cell types in plants.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating experimental and clinical evidence suggest that the immune response to cancer is not exclusively anti-tumor. Indeed, the pro-tumor roles of the immune system -- as suppliers of growth and pro-angiogenic factors or defenses against cytotoxic immune attacks, for example -- have been long appreciated, but relatively few theoretical works have considered their effects. Inspired by the recently proposed \"immune-mediated\" theory of metastasis, we develop a mathematical model for tumor-immune interactions at two anatomically distant sites, which includes both anti-and pro-tumor immune effects, and the experimentally observed tumor-induced phenotypic plasticity of immune cells (tumor \"education\" of the immune cells). Upon confrontation of our model to experimental data, we use it to evaluate the implications of the immune-mediated theory of metastasis. We find that tumor education of immune cells may explain the relatively poor performance of immunotherapies, and that many metastatic phenomena, including metastatic blow-up, dormancy, and metastasis to sites of injury, can be explained by the immune-mediated theory of metastasis. Our results suggest that further work is warranted to fully elucidate the protumor effects of the immune system in metastatic cancer.",

    "abstract": "Growth factor-induced signal transduction pathways are tightly regulated at multiple points intracellularly, but how cells monitor levels of extracellular ligand and translate this information into appropriate downstream responses remains unclear. Understanding signaling dynamics is thus a key challenge in determining how cells respond to external cues. Here, we demonstrate that different TGF-{beta} family ligands, namely Activin A and BMP4, signal with distinct dynamics, which differ profoundly from those of TGF-{beta} itself. The distinct signaling dynamics are driven by differences in the localization and internalization of receptors for each ligand, which in turn determine the capability of cells to monitor levels of extracellular ligand. Using mathematical modeling, we demonstrate that the distinct receptor behaviors and signaling dynamics observed may be primarily driven by differences in ligand-receptor affinity. Furthermore, our results provide a clear rationale for the different mechanisms of pathway regulation found in vivo for each of these growth factors.",

    "abstract": "The processing of transcripts from mammalian genes often occurs near in time and space to their transcription. Here we describe a phenomenon we call exon-mediated activation of transcription starts (EMATS) that affects thousands of mammalian genes in which the splicing of internal exons impacts the spectrum of promoters used and expression level of the host gene. We observed that evolutionary gain of new internal exons is associated with gain of new TSSs nearby and increased gene expression. Inhibiting exon splicing reduced transcription from nearby promoters. Conversely, creation of new splice sites and enable splicing of new exons activated transcription from cryptic promoters. The strongest effects were associated with weak promoters located proximal and upstream of efficiently spliced exons. Together, our findings support a model in which splicing factors recruit transcription machinery locally to influence TSS choice, and identify exon gain, loss and regulatory change as major contributors to the evolution of alternative promoters and altered gene expression in mammals.",

    "abstract": "Vitamin A is a dietary component that is essential for the development of intestinal immunity. Vitamin A is absorbed and converted to its bioactive derivatives retinol and retinoic acid by the intestinal epithelium, yet little is known about how epithelial cells regulate vitamin A-dependent intestinal immunity. Here we show that epithelial cell expression of the transcription factor retinoic acid receptor {beta} (RAR{beta}) is essential for vitamin A-dependent intestinal immunity. Epithelial RAR{beta} activated vitamin A-dependent expression of serum amyloid A (SAA) proteins by binding directly to Saa promoters. In accordance with the known role of SAAs in regulating Th17 cell effector function, epithelial RAR{beta} promoted IL-17 production by intestinal Th17 cells. More broadly, epithelial RAR{beta} was required for the development of key vitamin A-dependent adaptive immune responses, including CD4+ T cell homing to the intestine and the development of immunoglobulin A-producing intestinal B cells. Our findings provide insight into how the intestinal epithelium senses dietary vitamin A status to regulate adaptive immunity and highlight the role of epithelial cells in regulating intestinal immunity in response to diet.\n\nSignificance StatementVitamin A is a nutrient that is essential for the development of intestinal immunity. It is absorbed by gut epithelial cells which convert it to retinol and retinoic acid. Here we show that the transcription factor retinoic acid receptor {beta} (RAR{beta}) allows epithelial cells to sense vitamin A in the diet and regulate vitamin A-dependent immunity in the intestine. We find that epithelial RAR{beta} regulates several intestinal immune responses, including production of the immunomodulatory protein serum amyloid A, T cell homing to the intestine, and B cell production of immunoglobulin A. Our findings provide new insight into how epithelial cells sense vitamin A to regulate intestinal immunity and highlight why vitamin A is so important for immunity to infection.",

    "abstract": "Methods for heterologous protein production in Escherichia coli have revolutionized biotechnology and the bioindustry. It is ultimately important to increase the amount of protein product from bacteria. To this end, a variety of tools, such as effective promoters, have been developed. Here, we present a versatile molecular tool based on a phenomenon termed \"translation enhancement by a Dictyostelium gene sequence\" (\"TED\") in E. coli. We found that protein expression was increased when a gene sequence of Dictyostelium discoideum was placed upstream of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence located between the promoter and the initiation codon of a target gene. The most effective sequence among the genes examined was mlcR, which encodes the myosin regulatory light chain, a subunit of myosin II. Serial deletion analysis revealed that at least 10 bases of the 3 end of the mlcR gene enhanced the production of green fluorescent protein in cells. We applied this tool to a T7 expression system and found that the expression level of the proteins tested was increased when compared with the conventional method. Thus, current protein production systems can be improved by combination with TED.",

    "abstract": "Sleep plays a critical role in memory consolidation, however, the exact role that sleep and its effects on neural network dynamics play in this process is still unclear. Here, we combine computational and experimental approaches to study the dynamical, network-wide underpinnings of hippocampal memory consolidation during sleep. We provide data to support a novel hypothesis on the role of cellular resonance with sleep-associated theta band (4-12 Hz) hippocampal oscillations in this process. We show that increases in the stability of hippocampal memory representations after learning (which predicts successful memory consolidation) are mediated through emergent network-wide resonance and locking of neuronal activity to network oscillations. These changes arise in the network as a function of changes to network structure during learning, and mirror experimental findings in the hippocampus. Finally, we show that input-dependent pattern formation (e.g. \"replay\") in the hippocampus during sleep states, together with spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP)-based memory consolidation, leads to universal network activity reorganization. This reorganization generates heterogeneous changes in neuronal spiking frequency, similar to what has been observed in a variety of brain circuits across periods of sleep. Our results support the hypothesis that sleep plays an active role in memory consolidation by switching the hippocampal network from rate-based to phase-based information representation. The mechanisms through which this occurs supports the integration of heterogeneous cell populations into memory traces.\n\nSignificance StatementIn this study, we provide a mechanistic explanation of how sleep selectively facilitates memory consolidation, through recruitment of heterogeneous neuronal populations and structural reorganization of the network into an engram. Specifically, we show that emergent theta band oscillations during sleep facilitate stabilization of memory representations via spike timing dependent reinforcement. This stabilization, together with STDP, allows for systematic reorganization of synaptic connections within these populations, universally redistributing firing rates of participating neurons. Simultaneously, network oscillations facilitate a switch from rate-to phase-coding of information among neuronal populations with highly heterogenous firing frequencies, incorporating more neurons into the engram. Our results reconcile discrepant findings on network reorganization during sleep, and demonstrate a clear mechanism for both strengthening and weakening of synaptic efficacy during sleep.",

    "abstract": "Higher and higher interest has been shown in the recent years to large scale spiking simulations of cerebral neuronal networks, coming both from the presence of high performance computers and increasing details in the experimental observations. In this context it is important to understand how population dynamics are generated by the designed parameters of the networks, that is the question addressed by mean field theories. Despite analytic solutions for the mean field dynamics has already been proposed generally for current based neurons (CUBA), the same for more realistic neural properties, such as conductance based (COBA) network of adaptive exponential neurons (AdEx), a complete analytic model has not been achieved yet. Here, we propose a novel principled approach to map a COBA on a CUBA. Such approach provides a state-dependent approximation capable to reliably predict the firing rate properties of an AdEx neuron with non-instantaneous COBA integration. We also applied our theory to population dynamics, predicting the dynamical properties of the network in very different regimes, such as asynchronous irregular (AI) and synchronous irregular (SI) (slow oscillations, SO).\n\nThis results show that a state-dependent approximation can be successfully introduced in order to take into account the subtle effects of COBA integration and to deal with a theory capable to correctly predicts the activity in regimes of alternating states like slow oscillations.",
