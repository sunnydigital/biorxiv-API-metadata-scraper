    "abstract": "Epileptic seizures are known to follow specific changes in brain dynamics. While some algorithms can nowadays robustly detect these changes, a clear understanding of the mechanism by which these alterations occur and generate seizures is still lacking. Here, we provide cross-validated evidence that such changes are initiated by an alteration of physiological network state dynamics. Specifically, our analysis of long intracranial EEG recordings from a group of 10 patients identifies a critical phase of a few hours in which time-dependent network states become less variable (\\\"degenerate\\\") and is followed by a global functional connectivity reduction before seizure onset. This critical phase is characterized by an abnormal occurrence of highly correlated network instances and is shown to particularly affect the activity of resection regions in patients with validated postsurgical outcome. Our approach characterizes pre-seizure networks dynamics as a cascade of two sequential events providing new insights into seizure prediction and control.",

    "abstract": "Here we establish that, contrary to expectations, Caenorhabditis elegans nematode worms possess a color discrimination system despite lacking any opsin or other known visible light photoreceptor genes. We found that white light guides C. elegans foraging decisions away from harmful bacteria that secrete a blue pigment toxin. Absorption of amber light by this blue pigment toxin alters the color of light sensed by the worm, and thereby triggers an increase in avoidance. By combining narrow-band blue and amber light sources, we demonstrated that detection of the specific blue:amber ratio by the worm guides its foraging decision. These behavioral and psychophysical studies thus establish the existence of a color detection system that is distinct from those of other animals.",

    "abstract": "Many experimental approaches require housing rodents in individual cages, including in epilepsy research. However, rats and mice are social animals; and individual housing constitutes a stressful situation. The goal of the present study was to determine the effects of individual housing as compared to conditions maintaining social contact on stress markers and epilepsy. Control male mice socially housed during pretest and then transferred to individual cages for six weeks displayed anhedonia, increased anxiety and biological markers of stress as compared to pretest values or mice kept socially housed during six weeks. Pilocarpine-treated mice housed together showed increased levels of anhedonia, anxiety and stress markers as well as decreased cognitive performance as compared to the control group. The differences were more significant in pilocarpine-treated mice housed individually. Anxiety correlated linearly with cognitive performance and stress markers independently of the experimental conditions. In the male rat pilocarpine model, seizures were sixteen times more frequent in singly housed animals as compared to animals kept in pairs. Daily interactions with an experimenter in otherwise singly housed animals was sufficient to produce results identical to those found in animals kept in pairs. We propose that social isolation produces a severe phenotype in terms of stress and seizure frequency as compared to animals maintaining social contact (at least in these two models), a factor that needs to be taken into account for data interpretation, in particular for preclinical studies.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMany experimental approaches require housing rodents in individual cages, a stressful condition for social animals, even in an enriched environment context. Using the pilocarpine model of epilepsy in rats and mice, we report that singly housing animals develop a more severe phenotype in terms of stress and epilepsy as compared to animals maintaining social contact. We propose that social isolation adds a degree of complexity for the interpretation of data, which may be particularly relevant for preclinical studies.",

    "abstract": "The Full Drift Diffusion Model (DDM) is challenging to fit to behavioural data. Precision of the fits are usually poor for some if not all parameters, and computationally expensive to obtain. Moreover, inference at the trial level for each and every parameters, threshold included, has so far been considered as impossible. Most approaches rely on strong assumptions about the model structure, such as selection of the parameters that are subject to trial-to-trial variability or prior distribution of these parameters, that usually lack precise mathematical or empirical justifications. The fact that, in most versions of the DDM, the sequence of participants choices are considered as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), has been mainly overlooked so far. Our contribution to the field is threefold: first, we introduce Variational Bayes as a method to fit the full DDM. Second, we relax the i.i.d. assumption, and propose a data-driven algorithm based on a Recurrent Auto-Encoder, that estimates the local posterior probability of the DDM parameters at each trial based on the sequence of parameters and data preceding the data. Finally, we show that inference at the trial level can be achieved efficiently for each and every parameter of the DDM, threshold included. This data-driven approach is highly generic and self-contained, in the sense that no external input (e.g. regressors or physiological measure) is necessary to fit the data. Using simulations and real-world examples, we show that this method outperforms by several order of magnitude the i.i.d.-based ones, either Markov Chain Monte Carlo or i.i.d.-VB.",

    "abstract": "Cells must detect and respond to molecular events such as the presence or absence of specific small molecules. To accomplish this, cells have evolved methods to measure the presence and concentration of these small molecules in their environment and enact changes in gene expression or behavior. However, cells dont usually change their DNA in response to such outside stimuli. In this work, we have engineered a genetic circuit that can enact specific and controlled genetic changes in response to changing small molecule concentrations. Known DNA sequences can be repeatedly integrated into a genomic array such that their identity and order encodes information about past small molecule concentrations that the cell has experienced. To accomplish this, we use catalytically inactive CRISPR-Cas9 (dCas9) to bind to and block attachment sites for the integrase Bxb1. Therefore, through the co-expression of dCas9 and guide RNA, Bxb1 can be directed to integrate one of two engineered plasmids, which correspond to two orthogonal small molecule inducers that can be recorded with this system. We identified the optimal location of guide RNA binding to the Bxb1 attP integrase attachment site, and characterized the detection limits of the system by measuring the minimal small molecule concentration and shortest induction time necessary to produce measurable differences in array composition as read out by Oxford Nanopore long read sequencing technology.",

    "abstract": "I{kappa}B{zeta} is a transcriptional factor induced primarily in immune cells upon Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation that drives important cytokine responses. Recent studies have demonstrated constitutive I{kappa}B{zeta} expression in the epithelial cells of mouse skin and eyes, possibly reflecting the activation of TLRs by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). In this context, another mucosal surface, the lung epithelium, may not be as actively exposed to the external environment as the skin and the conjunctiva, especially since the lower lung airways are typically conceived to be sterile. Whether I{kappa}B{zeta} expression in the lungs is constitutive or induced remains largely unexplored. This is especially important since I{kappa}B{zeta} has been shown to promote the expression of protective cytokine and antimicrobial peptide responses, supporting a role for I{kappa}B{zeta} in lung host defense. We hence evaluated I{kappa}B{zeta} expression in airway epithelia of both humans and mice using immunostaining with antiserum raised against recombinant I{kappa}B{zeta} in our laboratory. We observed positive signal in the nuclei of ciliated epithelial cells lining the central airways. Airway cells of gnotobiotic mice also stained positive, suggesting that I{kappa}B{zeta} expression does not require induction by bacterial PAMPs. Unexpectedly, we also observed staining in the lung epithelia of I{kappa}B{zeta} knockout mice, indicating possible false positive signals from our immunohistochemistry experiments. In this context, 2D gel analysis followed by mass spectrometry revealed that our I{kappa}B{zeta} antiserum also detected a nuclear protein lamin B1. Nevertheless, immunoblotting tissue homogenates from gnotobiotic mouse lungs and primary human airway epithelial cells showed the appropriate 86 kDa band for I{kappa}B{zeta}. Together, these results demonstrate constitutive I{kappa}B{zeta} expression in airway epithelium, suggesting that lung epithelial cells may depend upon I{kappa}B{zeta} expression for airway protection.",

    "abstract": "Recreational use of concentrated oxygen has increased. Claims have been made that hyperoxic breathing can help reduce fatigue, increase alertness, and improve attentional capacities; however, few systematic studies of these potential benefits exist. Here we examined the effects of short-term (15 minute) hyperoxia on resting-states in awake human subjects by measuring spontaneous EEG activity between normoxic and hyperoxic situations, using a within-subjects design for both eyes-opened and eyes-closed conditions. We also measured respiration rate, heart rate, and blood oxygen saturation levels to correlate basic physiological changes due to the hyperoxic challenge with any brain activity changes. Our results show that breathing short term 100% oxygen led to increased blood-oxygen saturation levels, decreased heart rate, and a slight, but non-significant, decrease in breathing rate. Changes of brain activity were apparent, including decreases in low-alpha (7-10 Hz), high-alpha (10-14 Hz), beta (14-30 Hz), and gamma (30-50 Hz) frequency ranges during eyes-opened hyperoxic conditions. During eyes-closed hyperoxia, increases in the delta (0.5-3.5 Hz) and theta (3.5-7 Hz) frequency range were apparent together with decreases in the beta range. Hyperoxia appeared to accentuate the decrease of low alpha and gamma ranges across the eyes-opened and closed conditions suggesting that it modulated brain state itself. As decreased alpha during eyes-opened conditions has been associated with increased attentional processing and selective attention, and increased delta and theta during eyes-closed condition are typically associated with the initiation of sleep, our results suggest a state-specific and perhaps opposing influence of short-term hyperoxia.",

    "abstract": "Hi-C is a popular technique to map three-dimensional chromosome conformation by capturing the frequency of physical contacts between pairs of genomic regions in cell populations. Although the resolution of Hi-C data is in principle only limited by the size of restriction fragments (300 bp - 4 kb), stochastic noise caused by the limited sequencing coverage forces researchers to artificially reduce the resolution of Hi-C matrices by binning the genome into 5-100 kb regions, resulting in a loss of information and biological interpretability. Here, we present the Hi-C Interaction Frequency Inference (HIFI) algorithms, a family of computational approaches that takes advantage of dependencies between neighboring restriction fragments to estimate restriction-fragment resolution interaction frequency matrices from Hi-C data. HIFI is shown to be superior to existing fixed-binning and state-of-the-art approaches via cross-validation experiments on Hi-C data and comparisons to 5C data. It also greatly improves the delineation of enhancer-promoter contacts. Finally, the high resolution afforded by HIFI reveals a new role for active regulatory regions in structuring topologically associating domains (TADs) and subTADs. By operating upstream of many Hi-C data analysis tools (e.g., normalization tools, as well as loop, TAD, and compartment predictors), HIFI will be easily inserted into a number of Hi-C data analysis pipelines, enabling a variety of high-resolution genomic organization analyses.\\n\\nAvailabilitygithub.com/BlanchetteLab/HIFI",

    "abstract": "Classification of neurons into specific subtypes is essential for better understanding of brain function and information transmission. Despite continuous progress, there is still no consensus regarding categorizing neuron taxonomy into proper subtypes. Current morphology-based classification approaches largely rely on the dendritic tree structure or on the general axonal projection layout. In this study, we support the use of a morphology-based classification approach, focusing on the axonal tree. We demonstrate that utilizing the geometrical parameters of axonal tree structures significantly improves neuronal classification compared to the dendritic tree classification. Furthermore, we used neuronal activity patterns to classify interneurons into subtypes as well. Simulations of the activity along ramified axonal trees indicate that the axonal branching geometry may yield diverse responses in different subtrees. The classification schemes introduced here can be utilized to robustly classify neuronal subtypes in a functionally relevant manner. Our results open the door for deducing functionality from anatomical data.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol use is correlated within spouse-pairs, but it is difficult to disentangle the effects of alcohol consumption on mate-selection from social factors or cohabitation leading to spouses becoming more similar over time. We hypothesised that genetic variants related to alcohol consumption may, via their effect on alcohol behaviour, influence mate selection.\n\nTherefore, in a sample of over 47,000 spouse-pairs in the UK Biobank we utilised a well-characterised alcohol related variant, rs1229984 in ADH1B, as a genetic proxy for alcohol use. We compared the phenotypic concordance between spouses for self-reported alcohol use with the association between an individuals self-reported alcohol use and their partners rs1229984 genotype using Mendelian randomization. This was followed up by an exploration of the spousal genotypic concordance for the variant and an analysis determining if relationship length may be related to spousal alcohol behaviour similarities.\n\nWe found strong evidence that both an individuals self-reported alcohol consumption and rs1229984 genotype are associated with their partners self-reported alcohol use. The Mendelian randomization analysis found that each unit increase in an individuals weekly alcohol consumption increased their partners alcohol consumption by 0.26 units (95% C.I. 0.15, 0.38; P=1.10x10-5). Furthermore, the rs1229984 genotype was concordant within spouse-pairs, suggesting that some spousal concordance for alcohol consumption existed prior to cohabitation. Although the SNP is strongly associated with ancestry, our results suggest that this concordance is unlikely to be explained by population stratification. Overall, our findings suggest that alcohol behaviour directly influences mate selection.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesRecently an objective measure of speech intelligibility, based on brain responses derived from the electroencephalogram (EEG), has been developed using isolated Matrix sentences as a stimulus. We investigated whether this objective measure of speech intelligibility can also be used with natural speech as a stimulus, as this would be beneficial for clinical applications.\n\nDesignWe recorded the EEG in 19 normal-hearing participants while they listened to two types of stimuli: Matrix sentences and a natural story. Each stimulus was presented at different levels of speech intelligibility by adding speech weighted noise. Speech intelligibility was assessed in two ways for both stimuli: (1) behaviorally and (2) objectively by reconstructing the speech envelope from the EEG using a linear decoder and correlating it with the acoustic envelope. We also calculated temporal response functions (TRFs) to investigate the temporal characteristics of the brain responses in the EEG channels covering different brain areas.\n\nResultsFor both stimulus types the correlation between the speech envelope and the reconstructed envelope increased with increasing speech intelligibility. In addition, correlations were higher for the natural story than for the Matrix sentences. Similar to the linear decoder analysis, TRF amplitudes increased with increasing speech intelligibility for both stimuli. Remarkable is that although speech intelligibility remained unchanged in the no noise and +2.5 dB SNR condition, neural speech processing was affected by the addition of this small amount of noise: TRF amplitudes across the entire scalp decreased between 0 to 150 ms, while amplitudes between 150 to 200 ms increased in the presence of noise. TRF latency changes in function of speech intelligibility appeared to be stimulus specific: The latency of the prominent negative peak in the early responses (50-300 ms) increased with increasing speech intelligibility for the Matrix sentences, but remained unchanged for the natural story.\n\nConclusionsThese results show (1) the feasibility of natural speech as a stimulus for the objective measure of speech intelligibility, (2) that neural tracking of speech is enhanced using a natural story compared to Matrix sentences and (3) that noise and the stimulus type can change the temporal characteristics of the brain responses. These results might reflect the integration of incoming acoustic features and top-down information, suggesting that the choice of the stimulus has to be considered based on the intended purpose of the measurement.",

    "abstract": "Most living organisms display a decline in physiological performances when ageing, a process called senescence that is most often associated with increased mortality risk. Previous researches have shown that both the timing and the intensity of senescence vary a lot within and among species, but the role of environmental factors in this variation is still poorly understood. To fill this knowledge gap, we investigated the impact of environmental conditions on the strength of senescence using an experimental design applied to a population of common woodlouse Armadillidium vulgare intensively monitored in the lab. As no cellular senescence biomarker was available in woodlouse, our first step was to identify two biomarkers of senescence in this species: the {beta}-galactosidase activity and the profile of immune cells. These biomarkers provided evidence of sex-specific senescence patterns, with a higher {beta}-galactosidase activity and lower immune cell viability in females than in males at old age. We then tested the impact of environmental conditions, through changes in temperature and photoperiod, on these biomarkers. We found different effects of the environmental changing: The increasing of day light modification leaded the same effect as age on our senescence biomarkers while temperature modifications leaded the opposite effect as age on the {beta}-galactosidase activity and cell size. We also demonstrated the existence of sex-specific responses to changes in environmental conditions. By using an experimental approach and new biomarkers of senescence in woodlouse, we show that environmental conditions and sex both shape the diversity observed in senescence patterns of woodlouse and underline the importance of identifying senescence biomarkers to understand how environmental conditions influence the evolution of senescence.",

We find that longitudinal measurement consistency is high for behavioural and communication skills but low for other non-cognitive skills, implicating a high noise to signal ratio for many non-cognitive skills. Consistent non-zero heritability estimates and genetic correlations applied to cross-sectional measures are observed only for behavioural difficulties. When aggregating across multiple measurements, we find evidence of low heritability [Formula] for behaviour, communication, self-esteem and locus of control. We find weak correlations between aggregate measures of skills, further supporting cross-sectional measurement error in the non-cognitive measures. Associations between non-cognitive skills and educational outcomes are observed for skills measured in mid to late childhood and these are at most a third of the size of IQ-education associations. These results suggest that individual measures designed to capture non-cognitive skills may be subject to considerable measurement error and provide unreliable indicators of childrens skills. However, aggregate measures that leverage longitudinal data may more reliably identify underlying non-cognitive traits.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological surveillance for important wildlife diseases often relies on samples obtained from hunter-harvested animals. A problem, however, is that although convenient and cost-effective, hunter-harvest samples are not representative of the population due to heterogeneities in disease distribution and biased sampling. We developed an agent-based modeling framework that i) simulates a deer population in a user-generated landscape, and ii) uses a snapshot of the in silico deer population to simulate disease prevalence and distribution, harvest effort and sampling as per user-specified parameters. This framework can incorporate real-world heterogeneities in disease distribution, hunter harvest and harvest-based sampling, and therefore can be useful in informing wildlife disease surveillance strategies, specifically to determine population-specific sample sizes necessary for prompt detection of disease. Application of this framework is illustrated using the example of chronic wasting disease (CWD) surveillance in Missouris white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) population. We show how confidence in detecting CWD is grossly overestimated under the unrealistic, but standard, assumptions that sampling effort and disease are randomly and independently distributed. We then provide adjusted sample size recommendations based on more realistic assumptions. These models can be readily adapted to other regions as well as other wildlife disease systems.",

    "abstract": "Behavioral adaptations during performance rely on predicting and evaluating the consequences of our actions through action monitoring. Previous studies revealed that proprioceptive and exteroceptive signals contribute to error-monitoring processes, which are implemented in the posterior medial frontal cortex. Interestingly, errors trigger changes in autonomic nervous system activity such as pupil dilation or heartbeat deceleration. Yet, the contribution of implicit interoceptive signals of bodily states to error-monitoring during ongoing performance has been overlooked. This is more surprising given the evidence on the relevance of interoceptive signals for the modulation of perceptual, affective and cognitive processes.\\n\\nWe investigated whether cardiovascular interoceptive signals influence the neural correlates of error processing during performance, with an emphasis on the early stages of error processing. We recorded participants electroencephalography and electrocardiogram during the performance of highly-trained music pieces in musicians. Previous event-related potential (ERP) studies revealed that pitch errors during skilled musical performance are preceded by an error detection signal, the pre-error-negativity (preERN), and followed by a later error positivity (PE). In this study, by combining ERP, source localization and multivariate pattern classification analysis, we found that the error-correct ERP waveform had a larger amplitude within 40-100 ms following errors in the systolic period of the cardiac cycle. This component could be decoded from single-trials, was dissociated from the preERN and PE, and stemmed from the inferior parietal cortex, which is a region implicated in cardiac autonomic regulation. In addition, the cardiac phase influenced behavioral alterations resulting from errors, with a smaller post-error slowing and less perturbed velocity in keystrokes following pitch errors in the systole phase of the cardiac cycle. This study provides the first evidence of preconscious visceral information modulating neural and behavioral responses related to early error monitoring during skilled performance.",

    "abstract": "Acute pancreatitis (AP) is acute inflammation of the pancreas, mainly caused by gallstones and alcohol, driven by changes in communication between cells. Heparin-binding proteins (HBPs) play a central role in health and diseases. Therefore, we used heparin affinity proteomics to identify extracellular HBPs in pancreas and plasma of normal mice and in a caerulein mouse model of AP. Many new extracellular HBPs (360) were discovered in the pancreas, taking the total number of HBPs known to 786. Extracellular pancreas HBPs form highly interconnected protein-protein interaction networks in both normal pancreas (NP) and AP. Thus, HBPs represent an important set of extracellular proteins with significant regulatory potential in the pancreas. HBPs in NP are associated with biological functions such as molecular transport and cellular movement that underlie pancreatic homeostasis. However, in AP HBPs are associated with additional inflammatory processes such as acute phase response signalling, complement activation and mitochondrial dysfunction, which has a central role in the development of AP. Plasma HBPs in AP included known AP biomarkers such as serum amyloid A, as well as emerging targets such as histone H2A. Other HBPs such as alpha 2-HS glycoprotein (AHSG) and histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) need further investigation for potential applications in the management of AP. Pancreas HBPs are extracellular and so easily accessible and are potential drug targets in AP, whereas plasma HBPs represent potential biomarkers for AP. Thus, their identification paves the way to determine which HBPs may have potential applications in the management of AP.",

    "abstract": "Parasites of animals and plants can encounter trade-offs between their specificity to any single host and their fitness on alternative hosts. For parasites that manipulate their hosts behavior, the complexity of that manipulation may further limit the parasites host species range. The recently described crypt-keeper wasp, Euderus set, changes the behavior of the gall wasp Bassettia pallida such that B. pallida chews an incomplete exit hole in the side of its larval chamber and \\\"plugs\\\" that hole with its head. E. set benefits from this head plug, as it facilitates the escape of the parasitoid from the crypt after it completes development. Here, we ask whether this behavioral manipulator is limited to Bassettia hosts. We find that E. set attacks and manipulates the behavior of at least six additional gall wasp species, and that these hosts are taxonomically diverse. Interestingly, each of E. sets hosts has converged upon similarities in the extended phenotypes they induce in their plant hosts: the galls they induce on oaks share characters that may make them vulnerable to attack by E. set. Behavioral manipulation in this parasitoid system may be less important to its host range than other dimensions of the host-parasitoid interaction, like the hosts physical defenses.",

    "abstract": "Ontogenetic development hinges on the changes in gene expression in time and space within an organism, suggesting that the demands of ontogenetic growth can impose or reveal predictable pattern in the molecular evolution of genes expressed dynamically across development. Here we characterize co-expression modules of the C. elegans transcriptome, using a time series of 30 points from early-embryo to adult. By capturing the functional form of expression profiles with quantitative metrics, we find fastest evolution in the distinctive set of genes with transcript abundance that declines through development from young embryos. These genes are highly enriched for oogenic function (maternal provisioning), are non-randomly distributed in the genome, and correspond to a life stage especially prone to inviability in inter-species hybrids. These observations conflict with the \\\"early conservation model\\\" for the evolution of development, and provide only qualified support for the \\\"hourglass model.\\\" Genes in co-expression modules that peak toward adulthood also evolve fast, being hyper-enriched for roles in spermatogenesis, implicating a history of sexual selection and relaxation of selection on sperm as key factors driving rapid change to ontogenetically distinguishable co-expression modules of genes. These predictable trends of molecular evolution for dynamically-expressed genes across ontogeny might predispose particular life stages, early embryogenesis in particular, to hybrid dysfunction in the speciation process.",

The resulting model is far superior to using OGT alone for estimating Topt in a dataset of 2,609 enzymes.

    "abstract": "Post-translational modifications (PTMs) play very important roles in various cell signalling pathways and biological process. Due to PTMs extremely important roles, many major PTMs have been thoroughly studied, while the functional and mechanical characterization of major PTMs is well-documented in several databases. However, most currently available databases mainly focus on protein sequences, while the real 3D structures of PTMs have been largely ignored. Therefore, studies of PTMs 3D structural signatures have been severely limited by the deficiency of the data. Here, we develop PRISMOID, a novel publicly available and free 3D structure database for a wide range of PTMs. PRISMOID represents an up-to-date and interactive online knowledge base with specific focus on 3D structural contexts of PTMs sites and mutations that occur on PTMs and in the close proximity of PTM sites with functional impact. The first version of PRISMOID encompasses 17,145 non-redundant modification sites on 3,919 related protein 3D structure entries pertaining to 37 different types of PTMs. Our entry web page is organized in a comprehensive manner, including detailed PTM annotation on the 3D structure and biological information in terms of mutations affecting PTMs, secondary structure features and per-residue solvent accessibility features of PTM sites, domain context, predicted natively disordered regions and sequence alignments. In addition, high-definition JavaScript packages are employed to enhance information visualization in PRISMOID. PRISMOID equips a variety of interactive and customizable search options and data browsing functions; these capabilities allow users to access data via keyword, ID, and advanced options combination search in an efficient and user-friendly way. A download page is also provided to enable users to download the SQL file, computational structural features, and PTM sites data. We anticipate PRISMOID will swiftly become an invaluable online resource, assisting both biologists and bioinformaticians to conduct experiments and develop applications supporting discovery efforts in the sequence-structural-functional relationship of PTMs and providing important insight into mutations and PTM sites interaction mechanisms. The PRISMOID database is freely accessible at http://prismoid.erc.monash.edu/. The database and web interface are implemented in MySQL, JSP, JavaScript, and HTML with all major browsers supported.",

    "abstract": "Abstract.An undesirable side effect of drugs are cardiac arrhythmias, in particular a condition called torsades de pointes. Current paradigms for drug safety evaluation are costly, lengthy, and conservative, and impede efficient drug development. Here we combine multiscale experiment and simulation, high-performance computing, and machine learning to create an easy-to-use risk assessment diagram to quickly and reliable stratify the pro-arrhythmic potential of new and existing drugs. We capitalize on recent developments in machine learning and integrate information across ten orders of magnitude in space and time to provide a holistic picture of the effects of drugs, either individually or in combination with other drugs. We show, both experimentally and computationally, that drug-induced arrhythmias are dominated by the interplay of two currents with opposing effects: the rapid delayed rectifier potassium current and the L-type calcium current. Using Gaussian process classification, we create a classifier that stratifies safe and arrhythmic domains for any combinations of these two currents. We demonstrate that our classifier correctly identifies the risk categories of 23 common drugs, exclusively on the basis of their concentrations at 50% current block. Our new risk assessment diagram explains under which conditions blocking the L-type calcium current can delay or even entirely suppress arrhythmogenic events. Using machine learning in drug safety evaluation can provide a more accurate and comprehensive mechanistic assessment of the pro-arrhythmic potential of new drugs. Our study shapes the way towards establishing science-based criteria to accelerate drug development, design safer drugs, and reduce heart rhythm disorders.",

The interpretation of this high dimensional end-point time course data is often difficult, because sources of cell-to-cell abundance variation in measured species are hard to determine. Here I present an analytic tool to tackle this problem. By using a recently developed chemical signal generator to manipulate input noise of biochemical networks, measurement of state variables and modeling of input noise propagation, pathway-specific variability can be distinguished from environmental variability caused by network embedding. By employing different sources of natural input noise, changes in the output variability were quantified, indicating that also synthetic noisy perturbations are biologically feasible.

    "abstract": "Enzymes exhibit a strong long-range evolutionary constraint that extends from their catalytic site and affects even distant sites, where site-specific evolutionary rate increases monotonically with distance. While protein-protein sites in enzymes was previously shown to induce only a weak conservation gradient, a comprehensive relationship between different types of functional sites in proteins and the magnitude of evolutionary rate gradients they induce has yet to be established. Here, we systematically calculate the evolutionary rate (dN/dS) of sites as a function of distance from different types of binding sites on enzymes and other proteins: catalytic sites, non-catalytic ligand binding sites, allosteric binding sites, and protein-protein interaction sites. We show that catalytic binding sites indeed induce significantly stronger evolutionary rate gradient than all other types of non-catalytic binding sites. In addition, catalytic sites in enzymes with no known allosteric function still induce strong long-range conservation gradients. Notably, the weak long-range conservation gradients induced by non-catalytic binding sites on enzymes is nearly identical in magnitude to those induced by ligand binding sites on non-enzymes. Finally, we show that structural determinants such as local solvent exposure of sites cannot explain the observed difference between catalytic and non-catalytic functional sites. Our results suggest that enzymes and non-enzymes share similar evolutionary constraints only when examined from the perspective of non-catalytic functional sites. Hence, the unique evolutionary rate gradient from catalytic sites in enzymes is likely driven by the optimization of catalysis rather than ligand binding and allosteric functions.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence has suggested that protein or protein-like products can be encoded by previously uncharacterized Open Reading Frames (ORFs) that we define as Novel Open Reading Frames (nORFs)1,2. These nORFs are present in both coding and non coding regions of the human genome and the novel proteins that they encode have increased the number and complexity of cellular proteome from bacteria to humans. It is a conundrum whether these protein or protein-like products could play any significant functional biological role. But hopes have been raised to target them for anticancer and antimicrobial therapy3,4. To infer whether these novel proteins can perform biological functions, we used computational predictions to systematically investigate whether their amino acid sequences can form ordered or disordered structures. Our results indicated that that these novel proteins have significantly higher predicted disorder structure compared to all known proteins, yet we do not find any correlation between the pathogenicity of the mutations and whether they are present in the ordered and disordered regions of these novel proteins. This study reveals that we should investigate these novel proteins more systematically as they may be important to understand complex diseases.",

    "abstract": "A simple mechanical model of sound propagation in the human ear from the entrance to the ear canal up to the round window membrane is outlined. The model shows the outer, middle and inner ear as two waveguides connected by a lever mechanism. The case when a sound wave from a sound source at a given frequency and intensity goes into the ear is considered. The sound as a plane elastic wave in the air of the ear canal is partially reflected from the eardrum and after relocation by a lever of the ossicles; it runs as a plane elastic wave in the cochlea fluid to be finally damped at the round window membrane. The basilar membrane excited by the running sound wave in the cochlea is taken as a chain of separate fibers. The power of the sound reaching the ear is compared with the power of the sound carriers in the ear. As a result, simple rules for the amplitude of the stapes footplate as well as for the amplitude and pressure of the forced acoustic wave in the cochlea are obtained. The formulas for the amplitudes of the membrane of the round window and the basilar membrane are also shown. The results of calculations based on these rules were compared with the measurements made on temporal bone specimens. The tests were done for the level of the sound source intensity of 90 dB and a set of frequencies from the range of 400-10,000 Hz. The amplitudes of the stapes-footplate and the round window membrane were measured. A mean difference, between the calculated and the measured values, for the stapes-footplate reached 31%, and for the round window membrane, it was 21%. A ratio of the basilar membrane velocity to the stapes footplate velocity as a function of the frequencies was shown. The obtained graph was close to that got by others as a result of the measurements.",

    "abstract": "Senescence, the decline of physiological parameters with increasing age, is a quasi-ubiquitous phenomenon in the living world. The observed patterns of senescence, however, can markedly differ across species and populations, between sexes, and even among individuals. To identify the drivers of this variation in senescence, experimental approaches are essential and involve the development of tools and new study models. Current knowledge of the senescence process is mostly based on studies on vertebrates and main information about senescence in invertebrates is mostly limited to model organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans or Drosophila melanogaster. In this context, we tested whether biomarkers of vertebrate ageing could be used to study senescence in a new invertebrate model: the common woodlouse Armadillidium vulgare (Latreille, 1804). More specifically, we looked for the effect of age in woodlouse on three well-established physiological biomarkers of ageing in vertebrates: immune cells (cell size, density, and viability), {beta}-galactosidase activity, and the gene expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), an essential subunit of telomerase protein. We found that the size of immune cells was higher in older individuals, whereas their density and viability decreased, and that the {beta}-galactosidase activity increased with age, whereas the TERT gene expression decreased. These findings demonstrate that woodlouse displays age-related changes in biomarkers of vertebrate senescence, with different patterns depending on gender. The tools used in studies of vertebrate senescence can thus be successfully used in studies of senescence of invertebrates such as the woodlouse. The application of commonly used tools to new biological models offers a promising approach to assess the diversity of senescence patterns across the tree of life.",

    "abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) emerged as an important infectious disease agent in Brazil in 2016. Infection usually leads to mild symptoms but severe congenital neurological disorders and Guillain-Barre syndrome have been reported following ZIKV exposure. The development of an effective vaccine against Zika virus is a public health priority, encouraging the preclinical and clinical studies of different vaccine strategies. Here, we describe the protective effect of an already licensed attenuated yellow fever vaccine (17DD) on type-I interferon receptor knockout mice (A129) and immunocompetent (BALB/c) mice infected with ZIKV. Yellow fever virus vaccination results in robust protection against ZIKV, with decreased mortality in the A129 mice, a reduction in the cerebral viral load in all mice, and weight loss prevention in the BALB/c mice. Despite the limitation of yellow fever (17DD) vaccine to elicit antibody production and neutralizing activity against ZIKV, we found that YF immunization prevented the development of neurological impairment induced by intracerebral virus inoculation in adult. Although we used two vaccine doses in our protocol, a single dose was protective, reducing the cerebral viral load. Different Zika virus vaccine models have been tested; however, our work shows that an efficient and certified vaccine, available for use for several decades, effectively protects mice against Zika virus infection. These findings open the possibility for using an available and inexpensive vaccine to a large-scale immunization in the event of a Zika virus outbreak.",

    "abstract": "Bilateral convergence of external stimuli is a common feature of vertebrate sensory systems. This convergence of inputs from the bilateral receptive fields allows higher order sensory perception, such as depth perception in the vertebrate visual system and stimulus localization in the auditory system. The functional role of such bilateral convergence in the olfactory system is mostly unknown. To test whether each olfactory bulb contributes a separate piece of olfactory information, and whether information from the bilateral olfactory bulb is integrated, we synchronized the activation of olfactory bulbs with blue light in mice expressing channelrhodopsin in the olfactory sensory neurons and behaviorally assessed the relevance of dual olfactory bulb in olfactory perception. Our findings suggest that each olfactory bulb contributes separate components of olfactory information and mice integrate the olfactory information from each olfactory bulb to identify an olfactory stimulus.\n\nSignificance statementIdentifying an odor is the first step in olfactory coding, as it is critical for the survival of most animals. Previous studies have shown that bilateral olfactory bulbs help rodents to localize the odor source and navigate accordingly. But It is still unclear whether the bilateral olfactory information plays any role in determining odor identity. Here for the first time, using optogenetics and behavioral experiments, we demonstrate that each olfactory bulb provides distinct olfactory information, and rodents integrate information from the two bulbs to identify an odor.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid dysfunction is an important source of reproductive isolation between emerging species. Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities are theoretically well-recognized as the underlying cause of low hybrid dysfunction. However, especially in wild populations, little empirical evidence exists for which genes are involved in such incompatibilities. The relative role of ecological divergence in causing the build-up of genetic incompatibilities in relation to other processes such as genomic conflict therefore remains largely unknown. Genes involved in energy metabolism are potential candidates for genetic incompatibilities, since energy metabolism depends on co-expression of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA (nDNA) leading to mitonuclear coadaptation. When mitochondrial and nuclear genes lacking a co-evolutionary history appear together in hybrids, incompatibilities could arise. Ficedula flycatcher F1 hybrids have a higher resting metabolic rate (RMR) compared to the parental species, which could be a sign of genetic incompatibilities between energy metabolism genes that diverged in response to environmental differences while the species were in allopatry. Based on sequences of 15 mitochondrial genes of 264 individuals, we show that the two species have divergent mtDNA caused by the build-up of mainly synonymous mutations and a few non-synonymous mutations. Pied flycatcher mitogenomes show evidence of non-neutrality, indicating a selective sweep or population expansion. There is little variation in the nuclear OXPHOS-related proteins and no significant deviation from neutrality, however, specific codon identified sites might be under positive selection in both mitochondrial and nuclear genes encoding OXPHOS proteins for complex I and III. Taken together, these diverged mitonuclear genes therefore constitute possible candidates underlying, at least part of the genetic incompatibilities that cause hybrid dysfunction in crosses between collared and pied flycatchers.",

Due to the quantitative limitations of existing methods, colour and pattern are rarely analysed in conjunction with one another, despite a large body of literature and decades of research on the importance of spatiochromatic colour pattern analyses. Furthermore, key physiological limitations of animal visual systems such as spatial acuity, spectral sensitivities, photoreceptor abundances and receptor noise levels are rarely considered together in colour pattern analyses.\\nC_LIO_LIHere, we present a novel analytical framework, called the  Quantitative Colour Pattern Analysis (QCPA). We have overcome many quantitative and qualitative limitations of existing colour pattern analyses by combining calibrated digital photography and visual modelling. We have integrated and updated existing spatiochromatic colour pattern analyses, including adjacency, visual contrast and boundary strength analysis, to be implemented using calibrated digital photography through the  Multispectral Image Analysis and Calibration (MICA) Toolbox.\\nC_LIO_LIThis combination of calibrated photography and spatiochromatic colour pattern analyses is enabled by the inclusion of psychophysical colour and luminance discrimination thresholds for image segmentation, which we call  Receptor Noise Limited Clustering, used here for the first time. Furthermore, QCPA provides a novel psycho-physiological approach to the modelling of spatial acuity using convolution in the spatial or frequency domains, followed by  Receptor Noise Limited Ranked Filtering to eliminate intermediate edge artefacts and recover sharp boundaries following smoothing. We also present a new type of colour pattern analysis, the  Local Edge Intensity Analysis (LEIA) as well as a range of novel psycho-physiological approaches to the visualisation of spatiochromatic data.\\nC_LIO_LIQCPA combines novel and existing pattern analysis frameworks into what we hope is a unified, user-friendly, free and open source toolbox and introduce a range of novel analytical and data-visualisation approaches. These analyses and tools have been seamlessly integrated into the MICA toolbox providing a dynamic and user-friendly workflow.\\nC_LIO_LIQCPA is a framework for the empirical investigation of key theories underlying the design, function and evolution of colour patterns in nature. We believe that it is compatible with, but more thorough than, other existing colour pattern analyses.\\nC_LI",

Our results confirm the polygenic architecture of neuroanatomical diversity, with SNPs capturing from 40% to 54% of regional brain volume variance. Chromosomal length correlated with the amount of phenotypic variance captured, r[~]0.64 on average, suggesting that at a global scale causal variants are homogeneously distributed across the genome. At a local scale, SNPs within genes ([~]51%) captured [~]1.5 times more genetic variance than the rest; and SNPs with low minor allele frequency (MAF) captured less variance than the rest: the 40% of SNPs with MAF<5% captured <1/4th of the genetic variance. We also observed extensive pleiotropy across regions, with an average genetic correlation of rG[~]0.45. Genetic correlations were similar to phenotypic and environmental correlations, however, genetic correlations were often larger than phenotypic correlations for the left/right volumes of the same region. The heritability of differences in left/right volumes was generally not statistically significant, suggesting an important influence of environmental causes in the variability of brain asymmetry.

    "abstract": "BackgroundAs a result of decades of effort by many investigators we now have an advanced level of understanding about several molecular systems involved in the control of gene expression. Examples include CpG islands, promoters, mRNA splicing and epigenetic signals. It is less clear, however, how such systems work together to integrate the functions of a living organism. Here I describe the results of a study to test the idea that a contribution might be made by focusing on genes specifically expressed in a particular tissue, the human testis.\\n\\nExperimental DesignA database of 239 testis-specific genes was accumulated and each was examined for the presence of features relevant to control of gene expression. These include: (1) the presence of a promoter, (2) the presence of a CpG island (CGI) within the promoter, (3) the presence in the promoter of a transcription factor binding site near the transcription start site, (4) the level of gene expression, and (5) the above features in genes of cell types such as spermatocyte and spermatid that differ in their extent of differentiation.\\n\\nResultsOf the 107 database genes with an annotated promoter, 56 were found to have one or more transcription factor binding sites near the transcription start site. Three of the binding sites observed, Pax-5, AP-2A and GR, stand out in abundance suggesting they may be involved in testis-specific gene expression. Compared to less differentiated testis-specific cells, genes of more differentiated cells were found to be (1) more likely to lack a CGI, (2) more likely to lack introns and (3) higher in expression level. The results suggest genes of more differentiated cells have a reduced need for CGI-based regulatory repression, reduced usage of gene splicing and a smaller set of expressed proteins",

    "abstract": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a {beta}-herpesvirus that has co-evolved with the host immune system to establish lifelong persistence. HCMV encodes many immune-modulatory molecules, including the glycoprotein UL144. UL144 is a structural mimic of the TNFRSF member HVEM, which binds to various ligands LIGHT, LT, BTLA, CD160 and gD. However, in contrast to HVEM, UL144 selectively binds to only BTLA, inhibiting T cell activation. Here, we report the crystal structure of the UL144/BTLA complex, providing key insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying this virus-host protein interaction. Our structure reveals that UL144 utilizes residues from its N-terminal CRD1 to interact with BTLA in an orientation similar, but not exactly, to that of HVEM. The structural modifications at the CRD1 region of UL144 compared to HVEM have a significant impact on the fine-tuning of BTLA-binding. In addition, the N-terminal CRD2 loop of UL144 is shorter compared to the corresponding region of HVEM, altering the relative orientation of CRD2 with respect to CRD1. Employing structure-guided mutagenesis we have identified a mutant of BTLA (L123A) that interferes with binding to HVEM while preserving interaction towards UL144. Furthermore, our results illuminate structural differences between UL144 and HVEM that explain the inability of UL144 to bind to either LIGHT or CD160. In summary, the specific molecular differences that UL144 has evolved to exclusively target BTLA highlight it as a suitable scaffold for designing superior BTLA agonists that have high potential for potently inhibiting immune responses.\\n\\nImportanceThe co-evolution of HCMV with its host over millions of years has allowed the virus to develop an efficient and specific immune modulatory protein, UL144, that binds exclusively to an immune inhibitory receptor BTLA. The crystal structure of the UL144/BTLA complex presented in this manuscript provides key insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the virus-host protein interaction. The structure guided mutagenesis revealed select structural hot spots of the UL144/BTLA interaction. The structural details of this viral protein that has evolved to target only BTLA helps in successful design of BTLA agonists to target various T and B cell mediated autoimmune diseases.",

    "abstract": "Neuropeptides are a class of bioactive peptides and are responsible for various physiological processes including metabolism, development and reproduction. Although accumulated genome and transcriptome data have reported a number of neuropeptide candidates, it still remains difficult to obtain a comprehensive view of neuropeptide repertoires due to their small and variable nature. Neuropeptide prediction tools usually work only for those peptides for which sequentially related homologs have previously been identified. Recent peptidomics technology has enabled systematic structural identification of neuropeptides by using the combination of liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. However, obtaining reliable identifications of endogenous peptides is still difficult using a conventional tandem mass spectrometry-based peptide identification approach using protein database because a large search space has to be scanned due to the absence of a cleavage enzyme specification. We developed a pipeline consisting of the prediction of in silico cleaved endogenous neuropeptides followed by peptide-spectrum matching enabling highly sensitive and reliable neuropeptide identification. This approach effectively reduces the search space of peptide-spectrum matching, and thus increases search sensitivity. To identify neuropeptides in Nematostella vectensis, a basal eumetazoan having one of the most primitive nervous systems, we scanned the Nematostella protein database for sequences displaying structural hallmarks of metazoan neuropeptides, including C/N-terminal structures and modifications. Peptide-spectrum matching was performed against the in silico cleaved peptides and successfully identified dozens of neuropeptides at high confidence. The identification of Nematostella neuropeptides structurally related the tachykinin, GnRH/AKH, neuromedin-U/pyrokinin peptide families indicate that these peptides already originated in the eumetazoan ancestor of all animal species, most likely concomitantly with the development of a nervous system.",

    "abstract": "We hypothesized that postnatal development of the vagina is impacted by early nutritional environment. Our objective was to determine if lipid profiles of vaginal swabs were different between gilts suckled by sow or fed milk replacer the first 48 h postpartum, with and without a lard-based fat supplement. Gilts (>1.3 kg) were selected at birth across 8 litters and assigned to treatments: colostrum suckled (S, n=8); S plus fat supplement (SF, n=5); bottle-fed milk replacer (B, n=8); or B plus fat supplement (BF, n=7). At 48 h postnatal, vaginal swabs were taken with a cytology brush, immersed in ultrapure water to burst cells, and lipids extracted for analysis using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-profiling. Lipids extracted from serum collected at 48 h from gilts and milk collected from sows at 24 h were also analyzed with MRM-profiling. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis found 18 lipids highly distinguished [area-under-the-curve (AUC) > 0.9] between S and B gilts, including phosphatidylethanolamine with 34 carbon and four unsaturations in the fatty acyl residues [PE(34:4)].

    "abstract": "We aimed to describe multiple dimensions of poverty according to the capability approach theory by applying data mining approaches to the Cuatro Santos Health and Demographic Surveillance databases, Nicaragua. Four municipalities in northern Nicaragua constitute the Cuatro Santos area, with 25,893 inhabitants in 5,966 households (2014). A local process analyzing poverty-related problems and prioritizing suggested actions, was initiated 1997 based on a community action plan 2002-2015. Priority interventions were school breakfasts, environmental protection, water and sanitation, preventive healthcare, home gardening, micro credits, technical training, stipends for university education, and the use of Internet. In 2004, a survey of basic health and demographic information was performed in the whole population followed by surveillance updates in 2007, 2009, and 2014 linking households and individuals by unique identifiers. Information included the house (floor, walls) and services (water, sanitation, electricity) as well as demographic data (birth, deaths, migration). Data on participation in interventions, on food security, household assets, and womens self-rated health were collected in 2014. A K-means algorithm were used to cluster the household data (54 variables). The poverty ranking of household clusters using the unsatisfied basic needs index (UBN) variables changed when including variables describing basic capabilities. The households in the fairly rich cluster, having assets as motorbikes and computers were described as modern. Those in the fairly poor cluster, having different degrees of food insecurity were labeled vulnerable. Poor and poorest clusters of households were traditional e.g. in using horses for transport. Results displayed a society transforming from traditional to a modern, where the forerunners were not the richest but educated, had more working members of household, fewer children and were food secure. Those lagging were the poor, traditional and food insecure. The approach and results may be useful for an improved understanding of poverty and to direct local interventions.",

    "abstract": "Oat (Avena sativa L.) has a high concentration of oils, comprised primarily of healthful unsaturated oleic and linoleic fatty acids. To accelerate oat plant breeding efforts, we sought to identify loci associated with variation in fatty acid composition, defined as the types and quantities of fatty acids. We genotyped a panel of 500 oat cultivars with genotyping-by-sequencing and measured the concentrations of ten fatty acids in these oat cultivars grown in two environments. Measurements of individual fatty acids were highly correlated across samples, consistent with fatty acids participating in shared biosynthetic pathways. We leveraged these phenotypic correlations in two multivariate genome-wide association study (GWAS) approaches. In the first analysis, we fitted a multivariate linear mixed model for all ten fatty acids simultaneously while accounting for population structure and relatedness among cultivars. In the second, we performed a univariate association test for each principal component (PC) derived from a singular value decomposition of the phenotypic data matrix. To aid interpretation of results from the multivariate analyses, we also conducted univariate association tests for each trait. The multivariate mixed model approach yielded 148 genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at a 10% false-discovery rate, compared to 129 and 73 significant SNPs in the PC and univariate analyses, respectively. Thus, explicit modeling of the correlation structure between fatty acids in a multivariate framework enabled identification of loci associated with variation in seed fatty acid concentration that were not detected in the univariate analyses. Ultimately, a detailed characterization of the loci underlying fatty acid variation can be used to enhance the nutritional profile of oats through breeding.",

    "abstract": "Obtaining a comprehensive understanding of the gene regulatory networks, or gene cascades, involved in cell fate determination and cell lineage segregation in Caenorhabditis elegans is a long-standing challenge. Although RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a promising technique to resolve these questions, the bioinformatics tools to identify associated gene cascades from RNA-Seq data remain inadequate. To overcome these limitations, we developed Gene Cascade Finder (GCF) as a novel tool for building gene cascades by comparison of mutant and wild-type RNA-Seq data along with integrated information of protein-protein interactions, expression timing, and domains. Application of GCF to RNA-Seq data confirmed that SPN-4 and MEX-3 regulate the canonical Wnt pathway during embryonic development. Moreover, lin-35, hsp-3, and gpa-12 were found to be involved in MEX-1-dependent neurogenesis, and MEX-3 was found to control the gene cascade promoting neurogenesis through lin-35 and apl-1. Thus, GCF could be a useful tool for building gene cascades from RNA-Seq data.",

We evaluated the cellular role of PDE1, PDE3, and PDE4 activity in the rat insulinoma cell line INS-1 and in primary human {beta}-cells using subtype-selective PDE inhibitors. Using a genetically encoded, FRET-based cAMP sensor, we found that the PDE1 inhibitor 8MM-IBMX and the PDE4 inhibitor rolipram elevated cAMP levels above baseline in the absence and presence of 18 mM glucose in INS-1 cells. Inhibition of PDE1 or PDE4 potentiated glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in INS-1 cells. In contrast, the inhibition of PDE3 with cilostamide had little effect on cAMP levels or glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. PDE1 inhibition, but not PDE3 of PDE4 inhibition, reduced palmitate-induced caspase-3/7 activation, and enhanced CREB phosphorylation in INS-1 cells. In human {beta}-cells, only PDE3 or PDE4 inhibition increased cAMP levels in 1.7 mM glucose, but PDE1, PDE3, or PDE4 inhibition potentiated cAMP levels in 16.7 mM glucose. Inhibition of PDE1 or PDE4 increased cAMP levels to a greater extent in 16.7 mM glucose than in 1.7 mM glucose in human {beta}-cells. In contrast, elevation of cAMP levels by PDE3 inhibition was not different at these glucose concentrations. PDE1 inhibition also potentiated insulin secretion from human islets, suggesting that the role of PDE1 may be conserved between INS-1 cells and human pancreatic {beta}-cells. Our results suggest that inhibition of PDE1 may be a useful strategy to potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and to protect {beta}-cells from the toxic effects of excess fatty acids.",

The knowledge of the host-feeding patterns of vector species constitutes a key element in the assessment of their epidemiological importance in a given environment. The aim of this work was to identify the blood meal origins of Aedes vexans arabiensis Patton (Diptera: Culicidae), the main vector of RVF virus in the Ferlo pastoral ecosystem of Senegal. Engorged female mosquitoes were collected in Younoufere in the pastoral ecosystem in the Ferlo region during the 2014 rainy season. CDC light CO2-baited traps were set at six sites for two consecutive nights every month from July to November. Domestic animals present around traps were identified and counted for each trapping session. Blood meal sources of engorged mosquitoes were identified using a vertebrate-specific multiplexed primer set based on cytochrome b. Blood meal sources were successfully identified for 319 out of 416 blood-fed females (76.68%), of which 163 (51.1%) were single meals, 146 (45.77%) mixed meals from two different hosts and 10 (3.13%) mixed meals from three different hosts. Aedes vexans arabiensis fed preferentially on mammals especially on horse compared to other hosts (P < 0.001). Proportions of single and mixed meals showed significant temporal (P < 0.001) and spatial variations (P < 0.001) according to hosts availability. Aedes vexans arabiensis shows an opportunistic feeding behavior depending on the host availability. Results were discussed in relation with the Rift valley fever virus transmission and vector involvement as well as its primary hosts.",

This study aimed to identify Th cell biomarkers, including the analysis of Th17.1, that predict therapeutic response to abatacept in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The circulating Th subsets among CD4+ T lymphocytes in 40 patients with rheumatoid arthritis before abatacept treatment were determined using multicolor flow cytometry. All patients received abatacept treatment for 24 weeks, and the change in disease activity score, including 28-joint count C-reactive protein, and the responsiveness of other indices to abatacept treatment were evaluated according the European League Against Rheumatism criteria [good responders, moderate responders, and non-responders]. The correlation between the abatacept responses and the Th subsets (baseline) was analyzed. Logistic regression analysis with inverse probability weighting method was conducted to calculate odds ratio adjusted for patient characteristics. The proportion of baseline Th17.1 cells was significantly lower in patients categorized as good responders than in those categorized as non-good responders (moderate responders and non-responders; p = 0.0064). The decrease in 28-joint count C-reactive protein after 24 weeks of abatacept therapy also showed a significant negative correlation with the proportion of Th17.1 cells. The adjusted odds ratio for achieving good response in patients with baseline Th17.1 level below the median value was 14.6 (95% confidence interval, 2.9-72.3; p = 0.0021) relative to that in the remaining patients. The proportion of Th17.1 cells at baseline is a good candidate for the prediction of response to abatacept treatment. These novel findings may represent an important step in the pursuit of precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "Oral infection of mice with Salmonella Typhimurium is an important model system. In particular C57Bl/6 mice, which are susceptible to Salmonella, are used to study both systemic and gastrointestinal pathogenesis. Pretreatment with streptomycin disrupts the intestinal microbiota and results in colitis resembling human intestinal Salmonellosis. Oral gavage is typically used for delivery of both antibiotic and bacteria. Although convenient, this method requires a moderate level of expertise, can be stressful for experimental animals, and may lead to unwanted tracheal or systemic introduction of bacteria. Here, we demonstrate a simple method for oral infection of mice using small pieces of regular mouse chow inoculated with a known number of bacteria. Mice readily ate chow pieces containing up to 108 CFU Salmonella, allowing for a wide range of infectious doses. In mice pretreated with streptomycin, infection with inoculated chow resulted in less variability in numbers of bacteria recovered from tissues compared to oral gavage, and highly consistent infections even at doses as low as 103 Salmonella. Mice not treated with streptomycin, as well as resistant Nramp1 reconstituted C57Bl/6J mice, were also readily infected using this method. In summary, we show that foodborne infection of mice by feeding with pieces of chow inoculated with Salmonella results in infection comparable to oral gavage but represents a natural route of infection with fewer side effects and less variability among mice.",

    "abstract": "Vibrational behavior of psyllids was first documented more than six decades ago. Over the years, workers have postulated as to what the exact signal-producing mechanisms of psyllids might be but the exact mechanism has remained elusive. The aim of this study is to determine the specific signal-producing structures and mechanisms of the psyllids. Here we examine six hypotheses of signal-producing mechanisms from both previous and current studies that include: wing vibration, wing-wing friction, wing-thorax friction, wing-leg friction, leg-abdomen friction, and axillary sclerite-thorax friction. Through selective removal of possible signal producing structures and observing wing-beat frequency with a high-speed video recorder, six hypotheses were tested. Extensive experiments were implemented on the species Macrohomotoma gladiata Kuwayama, while other species belonging to different families, i.e., Trioza sozanica (Boselli), Mesohomotoma camphorae Kuwayama, Cacopsylla oluanpiensis (Yang), and Cacopsylla tobirae (Miyatake) were also examined to determine the potential prevalence of each signal-producing mechanism within the Psylloidea. Further, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine possible rubbing structures. The result of high speed photography showed that wing-beating frequency did not match the dominant frequency of vibrational signals, resulting in the rejection of wing vibration hypothesis. As for the selective removal experiments, the axillary sclerite-thorax friction hypothesis is accepted and wing-thorax friction hypothesis is supported partially, while others are rejected. The SEM showed that the secondary axillary sclerite of forewing bears many protuberances that would be suitable for stridulation. In conclusion, the signal-producing mechanism of psyllids involves two sets of morphological structures. The first is stridulation between the axillary cord and anal area of the forewing. The second is stridulation between the axillary sclerite of the forewing and the mesothorax.",

However, the dynamic change in soil nematode community in greenhouse with various continuous cropping years during plant growing season is unclear. Here, soil nematode communities in greenhouse after 2 and 10 years of continuous cropping were comparatively analyzed using 18S rDNA high-throughput sequencing to reveal the changing processes in soil nematode communities. Compared to the 2-year greenhouse, soil in the 10-year greenhouse showed soil acidification, nutrients accumulation, salinization. In term of -diversity, Bacterial-feeding nematodes (BF) were dominant in the 2-year greenhouse over the whole growing season, but plant-parasitic nematodes (PP) became the dominant group in the 10-year greenhouse in the late growing season. Meloidogyne gradually became the dominant group (Relative abundance 70.9%) in the 10-year greenhouse, while Rhabditidae (Relative abundance from 99.8% to 26.8%) was the predominant members in the 2-year greenhouse. For {beta}-diversity, hierarchical clustering analysis, unWeighted UniFrac principal component analysis (PCA) and principal co-ordinates analysis (PCoA) all revealed that soil nematode communities in the two types of greenhouses exhibited significant differences. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that soil nematode communities in the 10-year greenhouse were related to high soil organic material, total nitrogen, electrical conductivity and disease index of root knot nematode. Fisher exact test and Pearson correlation coefficients revealed that Meloidogyne caused main differences in soil nematode communities between the two types of greenhouses. Meanwhile, population dynamics of Meloidogyne were divided into dormant phase, low-level increasing phase and exponential phase during the whole season.

    "abstract": "Maternal survival has improved substantially in the last decades, but evidence on maternal morbidity and health service utilisation for various maternal diseases are scarce in low resource settings. We aimed to measure health service utilisation for maternal illnesses during pregnancy. A cohort study of 794 pregnant women in rural southern Ethiopia was carried-out from May 2017 to July 2018. Disease or illness identification criteria were: symptoms, signs, physical examination, and screening of anaemia. Follow-up was done every two weeks. Data on health service utilisation was obtained from women and confirmed by visiting the health facility. Multilevel, multiple responses, repeated measures, and generalized linear mixed model analysis were used. The cumulative incidence of women experiencing illness episodes was 91%, and there were 1.7 episodes of diseases or illnesses per woman. About 22% of pregnant women were anaemic and 8% hypertensive. Fourteen pregnant women experienced abortions, 6 had vaginal bleeding, 48% pain in the pelvic area, 4% oedema, and 72% tiredness. However, health service utilisation was only 7%. About 94% of anaemic women did not get iron-folic-acid tablet supplementation. Only two mothers with blurred vision and severe headache were referred for further treatment. The main reasons for not using the health services were: the perception that symptoms would heal by themselves (47%), illness to be minor (42%), financial constraints (10%), and lack of trust in health institutions (1%). Risk factors were being older women, poor, having a history of abortion, living far away from the health institution, travelled longer time to reach a health institution, and monthly household expenditure >=30 USD. In Conclusion, there was a high incidence of diseases or illnesses; however health service utilisation was low. Poor understanding of severe and non-severe symptoms was an important reason for low health service utilisation. Therefore, community-based maternal diseases or illness survey could help for early detection. Ministry of Health should promote health education that encourages women to seek appropriate and timely care.",

    "abstract": "Toxoplasmic encephalitis is an AIDS-defining condition in HIV+ individuals. The decline of IFN-{gamma}-producing CD4+ T cells in AIDS is a major contributing factor in reactivation of quiescent Toxoplasma gondii to an actively replicating stage of infection. Hence, it is important to identify CD4-independent mechanisms to control acute T. gondii infection. Here we have investigated the targeted expansion and regulation of IFN-{gamma} production by CD8+ T cells, DN T cells and NK cells in response to T. gondii infection using IL-2 complex (IL2C) pre-treatment in an acute in vivo mouse model. Our results show that expansion of CD8+ T cells, DN T cells and NK cell by S4B6 IL2C treatment increases survival rates of mice infected with T. gondii and this increased survival is dependent on both IL-12- and IL-18-driven IFN-{gamma} production. Processing and secretion of IFN-{gamma}-inducing, bioactive IL-18 is dependent on the sensing of active parasite invasion by multiple redundant inflammasome sensors in multiple hematopoietic cell types but independent from T. gondii-derived dense granule (GRA) proteins. Our results provide evidence for a protective role of IL2C-mediated expansion of CD8+ T cells, DN T cells and NK cells in murine toxoplasmosis and may represent a promising adjunct therapy for acute toxoplasmosis.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryA third of the worlds population is chronically infected with the parasite Toxoplasma gondii. In most cases the infection is asymptomatic, but in individuals suffering from AIDS, reactivation of brain and muscle cysts containing T. gondii is a significant cause of death. The gradual decline of CD4 T cells, the hallmark of AIDS, is believed to be a major contributing factor in reactivation of T. gondii infection and the development of acute disease. In this study, we show that targeted expansion of non-CD4 immune cell subsets can prevent severe disease and premature death via increased availability of interferon gamma-producing immune cells. We also demonstrate that the upstream signaling molecule interleukin-18 is required for the protective immune response by non-CD4 cells and show that the sensing of active parasite invasion by danger recognition molecules is crucial. Our findings reveal that targeted cell expansion may be a promising therapy in toxoplasmosis and suggests that the development of novel intervention strategies targeting danger recognition pathways may be useful against toxoplasmosis, particularly in the context of AIDS.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is a major opportunistic pathogen that is exposed to antimicrobial innate immune effectors and antibiotics that can disrupt its cell membrane. An understanding of S. aureus lipid composition and its role in defending the cell against membrane-disrupting agents is of fundamental importance. Common methods for characterising lipid profiles suffer shortcomings such as low sensitivity of detection and inferior resolution of the positional assignments of fatty acid chains in lipids. This present study developed a rapid and sensitive nano-electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry (nESI-MS/MS) method to characterise the lipid composition of three commonly studied S. aureus isolates: Newman, Mu50 and BB270. Confirming previous studies, nESI-MS/MS revealed that phosphatidylglycerols were most abundant in S. aureus membranes, while diglucosyldiacylglycerols and lysyl-phosphatidylglycerols were also detected. Positional assignments for individual fatty acid chains within these lipids were also determined. Concomitantly, gas chromatography mass spectrometry of the fatty acids validated the molecular characterization and showed the principal species present in each strain were predominately anteiso- and iso-branched chain fatty acids. Though the fatty acid and lipid profiles were similar between the S. aureus strains, this method was sufficiently sensitive to distinguish minor differences in lipid composition. In conclusion, this nESI-MS/MS methodology can characterise the role of lipids in antimicrobial resistance, and may even be applied to the rapid diagnosis of drug-resistant strains in the clinic.",

    "abstract": "How head patterning is regulated in vertebrates is yet to be understood. In this study, we show that frog embryos injected with Noggin at different blastula and gastrula stages had their head development sequentially arrested at different positions. When timed BMP inhibition was applied to BMP-overexpressing embryos, the expression of five genes: xcg-1 (a marker of the cement gland, which is the front-most structure in the frog embryo), six3 (a forebrain marker), otx2 (a forebrain and mid-brain marker), gbx2 (an anterior hindbrain marker) and hoxd1 (a posterior hindbrain marker) were sequentially fixed. These results suggest that timed interactions between BMP and anti-BMP are involved in patterning the vertebrate head progressively in time and space. Since the above genes are not expressed sequentially, there may be a BMP dependent gene sequence during head patterning that can be arrested by BMP inhibition and regulate the specification of positional values in the head.",

However, the functional effects of most of these variants are unknown. Moreover, GWASs do not provide context-specific information on cell types or environmental factors that affect specific disease risks and outcomes. To address these limitations, we used an upper airway (sinonasal) epithelial cell culture model to assess transcriptional and epigenetic responses to an asthma-promoting pathogen, rhinovirus (RV), and provide context-specific functional annotations to variants discovered in GWASs of asthma.\n\nMethodsUsing genome-wide genetic, gene expression and DNA methylation data in vehicle- and RV-treated airway epithelial cells (AECs) from 104 individuals, we mapped cis expression and methylation quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs and cis-meQTLs, respectively) in each condition. A Bayesian test for co-localization between AEC molecular QTLs and adult onset and childhood onset GWAS variants was used to assign function to variants associated with asthma. Mendelian randomization was applied to demonstrate DNA methylation effects on gene expression at asthma colocalized loci.\n\nResultsCo-localization analyses of airway epithelial cell molecular QTLs with asthma GWAS variants revealed potential molecular disease mechanisms of asthma, including QTLs at the TSLP locus that were common to both exposure conditions and to both childhood and adult onset asthma, as well as QTLs at the 17q12-21 asthma locus that were specific to RV exposure and childhood onset asthma, consistent with clinical and epidemiological studies of these loci.\n\nConclusionThis study provides information on functional effects of asthma risk variants in airway epithelial cells and insight into a disease-relevant viral exposure that modulates genetic effects on transcriptional and epigenetic responses in cells and on risk for asthma in GWASs.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing the developmental trajectories of cognitive functions such as learning, memory and decision making across the lifespan faces fundamental challenges. Cognitive functions typically encompass several processes that can be differentially affected by age. Methodological issues also arise when comparisons are made across age groups that differ in basic performance measures, such as in average response times (RTs). Here we focus on procedural learning - a fundamental cognitive function that underlies the acquisition of cognitive, social, and motor skills - and demonstrate how disentangling subprocesses of learning and controlling for differences in average RTs can reveal different developmental trajectories across the human lifespan. Two hundred-seventy participants aged between 7 and 85 years performed a probabilistic sequence learning task that enabled us to separately measure two processes of procedural learning, namely general skill learning and statistical learning. Using raw RT measures, in between-group comparisons, we found a U-shaped trajectory with children and older adults exhibiting greater general skill learning compared to adolescents and younger adults. However, when we controlled for differences in average RTs (either by using ratio scores or focusing on a subsample of participants with similar average speed), only children (but not older adults) demonstrated superior general skill learning consistently across analyses. Testing the relationship between average RTs and general skill learning within age groups shed light on further age-related differences, suggesting that general skill learning measures are more affected by average speed in some age groups. Consistent with previous studies of learning probabilistic regularities, statistical learning showed a gradual decline across the lifespan, and learning performance seemed to be independent of average speed, regardless of the age group. Overall, our results suggest that children are superior learners in various aspects of procedural learning, including both general skill and statistical learning. Our study also highlights the importance to test, and control for, the effect of average speed on other RT measures of cognitive functions, which can fundamentally affect the interpretation of group differences in developmental, aging and clinical psychology and neuroscience studies.",

    "abstract": "Genetic research is a rapidly evolving field of study that is increasingly being utilized as a tool for wildlife conservation. However, researchers and science educators in remote areas can often find it difficult to access the latest genetic technologies, often due to a combination of high costs, bulky equipment, and lack of infrastructure. Recent technological innovations are resulting in portable, low-cost instruments that enable next-generation sequencing in remote environments, offering new opportunities to generate a more widespread network of trained conservation scientists, particularly within regions of high biodiversity. What is currently lacking are formalized educational efforts to teach participants in biodiverse areas with hands-on training in molecular biology and real-time DNA sequencing techniques. To address this challenge, we report the design and summarized feedback/outcomes of a conservation genetics field course, called  Genomics in the Jungle, that took place at a field research station in the Amazon rainforest of southeastern Peru. The program was established by a small US-based NGO, Field Projects International, and facilitated by a local eco-tourism company in Peru, Inkaterra. We utilized portable sequencing technologies from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, and in-kind support from the manufacturers MiniPCR, MiniOne Systems, Promega, and New England Biolabs. Participants included a mix of non-Peruvian students and local/regional students, some of which had no prior exposure to a genetics laboratory. Overall, we maintain that portable sequencing technology is democratizing scientific research and conservation efforts, and is a major step forward for science educators and conservationists.",

    "abstract": "The widespread structural motif of Leucine-rich repeats (LRR) constitute the extracellular part of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family preceded by an intracellular Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain at the C-terminus. The benefit of using LRRs in these pattern recognition receptors (PRR) that are responsible for early detection of pathogens to elicit inflammatory/innate immune response still remains elusive. Phylogenetic analyses (Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference) of nine TLR (TLR 1-9) genes from 36 mammals reconfirmed the existence of two distinct clades, one (TLR1/2/6) for recognizing bacterial cell wall derivatives and another (TLR7/8/9) for various nucleic acids. TLR3, TLR4 and TLR5 showed independent line of evolution. The distinction of the TLR1 subfamily to form heterodimers within its members and the existence of the paralogs TLR1 and TLR6 therein, was appealing enough to carry out further studies with the extracellular recognition domain. Dimerizing and ligand binding residues from the crystal structures of TLR1 and TLR6 were interchanged to generate chimeric proteins. The dimer forming ability of these variants with their common partner, TLR2, were checked before running MD simulations. The chimeras were compared with wild type dimers to find no significant alterations in the overall structure. Finally, interchanged ligands were docked to the variants to ratify reversal of the binding function. Intriguingly, sequence change in substantial numbers, 16 in TLR1 and 18 in TLR6, preserves the native scaffold offered by LRRs. This exercise thus depicts how the LRR motif has been advantageous to be selected as an evolutionarily conserved motif for essential cellular processes.",

Therefore, the clinical utility of miRNAs as biomarkers and drug targets for bone diseases certainly merits further investigation. This study describes the use of an animal model of postmenopausal osteoporosis to generate a comprehensive dataset on miRNA regulation in bone tissue and peripheral blood during bone loss and specifically anti-resorptive and osteo-anabolic treatment.\\n\\nForty-two Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to SHAM surgery (n=10) or ovariectomy (OVX, n=32). Eight weeks after surgery, OVX animals were further randomized to anti-resorptive treatment with zoledronate (n=11), osteo-anabolic treatment with teriparatide (n=11), or vehicle treatment (n=10). After 12 weeks of treatment, bone and serum samples were used for microRNA analysis using next-generation sequencing (NGS), mRNA levels using RT-qPCR, and bone microarchitecture analysis using nanoCT.\\n\\nOvariectomy resulted in loss of trabecular bone, which was fully rescued using osteo-anabolic treatment, and partially rescued using anti-resorptive treatment. NGS revealed that both, anti-resorptive and anabolic treatment had a significant impact on miRNA levels in bone tissue and serum: out of 426 detected miRNAs, 46 miRNAs were regulated by teriparatide treatment an d 10 by zoledronate treatment (p-adj. < 0.1). Interestingly, teriparatide and zoledronate treatment were able to revert miRNA changes in tissue and serum of untreated OVX animals, such as the up-regulation of miR-203a-3p, a known osteo-inhibitory miRNA. We confirmed previously established mechanisms of miR-203a by analyzing its direct target Dlx5 in femoral head.\\n\\nOur data reveal a significant effect of ovariectomy-induced bone loss, as well as the two major types of anti-osteoporotic treatment on miRNA transcription in femoral head tissue. These changes are associated with altered activity of target genes relevant to bone formation, such as Dlx5. The observed effects of bone loss and treatment response on miRNA levels in bone are also reflected in the peripheral blood, suggesting the possibility of minimally-invasive monitoring of bone-derived miRNAs using liquid biopsies.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LImicroRNA expression in bone tissue is altered by osteo-anabolic and anti-resorptive therapy in OVX rats.\\nC_LIO_LImicroRNA changes in untreated OVX rats are reverted by anti-osteoporotic therapy.\\nC_LIO_LImiR-203a is up-regulated during bone loss and down-regulated following therapy.\\nC_LIO_LIBone tissue and serum levels of miR-203a are highly correlated.\\nC_LI",

Space-based models of memory implicate the hippocampus, retrosplenial cortex, and precuneus in early memory computations. Here we used inhibitory continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) to determine the causal role of the precuneus in the temporal dynamics of AM retrieval. Compared to vertex, precuneus stimulation altered evoked neural activity during early memory construction, as early as 400 ms after cue presentation, as well as during later memory elaboration. We further identified a parietal late positive component during memory elaboration, the amplitude of which was associated with spatial perspective during recollection. Precuneus stimulation disrupted this association, suggesting that this region plays a crucial role in the neural representation of spatial perspective during AM. These findings help clarify the neural correlates of early memory retrieval and demonstrate a causal role for the precuneus in the temporal dynamics of AM retrieval.",

Receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs) such as ZED1, interact with ZAR1 and provide specificity for different effector proteins, such as HopZ1a. We previously developed a transient expression system in Nicotiana benthamiana, that allowed us to demonstrate ZAR1 function is conserved from the Brassicaceae to the Solanaceae.

How these transitions occur, and what role they play in adaptation, have been subjects of active interest in evolutionary genetics for almost a century. However, to our knowledge, this problem has never been addressed directly, by considering the evolution of a gene, or group of genes, as a whole, including the complex effects of fitness interactions among multiple loci. Here, we use a precise model of protein fitness to compute the probability P(s, {Delta}t) that an allele, randomly sampled from a population at time t, has crossed a fitness valley of depth s during an interval [t - {Delta}t, t] in the immediate past. We study populations of model genes evolving under equilibrium conditions consistent with those in mammalian mitochondria. From this data, we estimate that genes encoding small protein motifs navigate fitness valleys of depth 2Ns {gtrsim} 30 with probability P {gtrsim} 0.1 on a time scale of human evolution, where N is the (mitochondrial) effective population size. The results are consistent with recent findings for Watson-Crick switching in mammalian mitochondrial tRNA molecules.",

    "abstract": "The genetic code likely arose when a bidirectional gene began to produce ancestral aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) capable of distinguishing between two distinct sets of amino acids. The synthetase Class division therefore necessarily implies a mechanism by which the two ancestral synthetases could also discriminate between two different kinds of tRNA substrates. We used regression methods to uncover the possible patterns of base sequences capable of such discrimination and find that they appear to be related to thermodynamic differences in the relative stabilities of a hairpin necessary for recognition of tRNA substrates by Class I aaRS. The thermodynamic differences appear to be exploited by secondary structural differences between models for the ancestral aaRS called synthetase Urzymes and reinforced by packing of aromatic amino acid side chains against the nonpolar face of the ribose of A76 if and only if the tRNA CCA sequence forms a hairpin. The patterns of bases 1, 2 and 73 and stabilization of the hairpin by structural complementarity with Class I, but not Class II aaRS Urzymes appears to be necessary and sufficient to have enabled the generation of the first two aaRS*tRNA cognate pairs, and the launch of a rudimentary binary genetic coding related recognizably to contemporary cognate pairs. As a consequence, it seems likely that non-random aminoacylation of tRNAs preceded the advent of the tRNA anticodon stem-loop. Consistent with this suggestion, coding rules in the acceptor-stem bases also reveal a palimpsest of the codon*anticodon interaction, as previously proposed.",

    "abstract": "Transport of proteins across and into membranes is a fundamental biological process with the vast majority being conducted by the ubiquitous Sec machinery. In bacteria, this is usually achieved when the SecY-complex engages the cytosolic ATPase SecA (secretion) or translating ribosomes (insertion). Great strides have been made towards understanding the mechanism of protein translocation. Yet, important questions remain - notably, the nature of the individual steps that constitute transport, and how the proton-motive force (PMF) across the plasma membrane contributes. Here, we apply a recently developed high-resolution protein transport assay to explore these questions. We find that pre-protein transport is limited primarily by the diffusion of arginine residues across the membrane, particularly in the context of bulky hydrophobic sequences. This specific effect of arginine, caused by its positive charge, is mitigated for lysine which can be deprotonated and transported across the membrane in its neutral form. These observations have interesting implications for the mechanism of protein secretion, suggesting a simple mechanism by which PMF can aid transport, and enabling a  proton ratchet, wherein re-protonation of exiting lysine residues prevents channel re-entry, biasing transport in the outward direction.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1 Associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND) is commonly seen in HIV-infected patients. Viral proteins including Tat cause neuronal toxicity and is worsened by drugs of abuse. To uncover potential targets for anti-HAND therapy, we employed a literature mining system, MOLIERE. Here, we validated Dead Box RNA Helicase 3 (DDX3) as a target to treat HAND via a selective DDX3 inhibitor, RK-33. The combined neurotoxicity of Tat protein and cocaine was blocked by RK-33 in rat and mouse cortical cultures. Transcriptome analysis showed that Tat-activated transcripts include makers and regulators of microglial activation, and RK-33 blocked Tat-induced activation of these mRNAs. Elevated production of proinflammatory cytokines was also inhibited by RK-33. These findings show that DDX3 contributes to microglial activation triggered by Tat and cocaine, and DDX3 inhibition shows promise as a therapy for HAND. Moreover, DDX3 may contribute to the pathology of other neurodegenerative diseases with pathological activation of microglia.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a multifactorial disorder driven by sustained energy imbalance. The hypothalamus is an important regulator of energy homeostasis and therefore likely involved in obesity pathophysiology. Animal studies suggest that obesity-related diets induce structural changes in the hypothalamus through inflammation-like processes. Whether this translates to humans is however largely unknown. Therefore, we aimed to assess obesity-related differences in hypothalamic macro- and microstructure based on a multimodal approach using T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquired at 3 Tesla in a large well-characterized sample of the Leipzig Research Center for Civilization Diseases (LIFE) cohort (n1 = 338, 48% females, age 21-78 years, BMI 18-43 kg/m2). We found that higher body mass index (BMI) selectively predicted higher mean proton diffusivity (MD) within the hypothalamus, indicative of compromised microstructure in the underlying tissue. Results were independent from confounders and confirmed in another independent sample (n2 = 236). In addition, while hypothalamic volume was not associated with obesity, we identified a sexual dimorphism and larger hypothalamic volumes in the left compared to the right hemisphere. Using two large samples of the general population, we showed that a higher BMI specifically relates to altered microstructure in the hypothalamus, independent from confounders such as age, sex and obesity-associated co-morbidities. This points to persisting microstructural changes in a key regulatory area of energy homeostasis occurring with excessive weight. These findings may help to better understand the pathomechanisms of obesity and other eating-related disorders.",

    "abstract": "Lipooxygenase-5 (5-LOX), protein is involved in the pathologic phenotype of AD which includes amyloid-plague and tau hyperphosphorylation. This study aims to identify the mechanistic role in neuroprotection by peptide YWCS, the 5-LOX inhibitor in neurotoxic SH-SY5Y cell line developed by the treatment of A{beta}25-35. The cells were treated with A{beta}25-35 and with different doses of YWCS. The effect on cell survival pathways were determined by western blot using polyclonal anti body of p53, anti-Akt and anti-phosphorylated-Akt. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectroscopic studies were done to identify the altered proteins. Over expression of phosphorylated-Akt and 3 bands of p53 isoforms were observed which correspond to p73, {Delta}133p53 and {Delta}160p53 in the cells treated only with 80{micro}M of YWCS compare to untreated cells. However, no alteration of total p53 and Akt were observed. The results exposed the novel mechanistic pathway of neuroprotection by 5-LOX inhibition, which is likely to be mediated by DNA DSB repair through p53 isoforms and PI3K/Akt pathway. Our finding has opened a new window in the therapeutic approach for the prevention of AD.",

    "abstract": "In fMRI decoding studies using pattern classification, a \"second-level\" group statistical test is typically performed after \"first-level\" decoding analyses for individual participants. Neuroscientists often test the mean decoding accuracy across participants against the chance-level accuracy (e.g., one-sample Student t-test) to verify whether brain activation includes information about the label (i.e., cognitive content). However, Allefeld et al., (2016) notified that positive results for such tests only indicate that \"there are some people in the population whose fMRI data carry information about the experimental condition.\" Thus, such tests cannot provide inferences about the trend of the majority. They proposed an alternative method, in which prevalence inference is implemented. In this study, I extended their method and propose statistical test \"information prevalence inference using the i-th order statistic (i-test)\". Compared with the method proposed in the previous study, i-test has high statistical power to provide an inference regarding major population trends. In i-test, the i-th lowest sample decoding accuracy (the i-th order statistic) is compared to the null distribution to test whether the proportion of the higher-than-chance decoding accuracy in the population (information prevalence) is higher than the threshold. Thus, a significant result of the i-test can be interpreted as \"the majority of the population has information about the label in the brain.\" Numerical calculation identified its high statistical power. Also, theoretical detail is provided, and the use of this method in an fMRI decoding study is demonstrated.\n\nAllefeld, C., Gorgen, K., Haynes, J.D., 2016.

    "abstract": "During adult hippocampal neurogenesis, the majority of newborn cells undergo apoptosis and are rapidly phagocytosed by resident microglia to prevent the spillover of their intracellular contents. Here, we propose that phagocytosis is not merely a passive process of corpse removal but has an active role in maintaining adult hippocampal neurogenesis. First, we found that neurogenesis was disrupted in mice chronically deficient for two microglial phagocytosis pathways (P2Y12 and MerTK/Axl), but was transiently increased in mice in which MerTK expression was conditionally downregulated. Next, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of microglial phagocytosis in vitro and identified genes involved in metabolism, chromatin remodeling, and neurogenesis-related functions. Finally, we discovered that the secretome of phagocytic microglia limits the production of new neurons both in vivo and in vitro. Our data suggest that reprogrammed phagocytic microglia act as a sensor of local cell death, modulating the balance between cell proliferation and cell survival in the neurogenic niche, thereby supporting the long-term maintenance of adult hippocampal neurogenesis.\\n\\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT",

Interactions between FIPs and forest owners have the potential to create ecosystem impacts that compound direct impacts. We assessed family forest owners responses to numerous contingent behavior, FIP-outbreak scenarios in the northeastern U.S. based on FIP outbreak attributes. Sixty-two percent of scenario responses (n=2,752) reflected a harvest intent as a result of FIPs; 84% of respondents (n=688) would consider harvesting in at least one of the four hypothetical scenarios presented to them. Harvest intention increased with greater FIP-related tree mortality and decreased with delayed total tree mortality. Owners with larger holdings, who had previously harvested forest products, and live on their forestland had greater intentions to harvest in response to FIPs. Results suggest that FIPs could transform the regional harvest regime with socio-ecological impacts that are distinct from those caused by FIPs or harvesting alone.",

It allows for the rapid generation of a large number of flies with full incorporation of lysine-6. SILAF followed by fractionation and enrichment gave proteomic insights at a depth of 5,966 proteins and 7,496 phosphorylation sites, which substantiated metabolic regulation on enzymatic level. Furthermore, the label can be traced and predicts protein turnover rates during different developmental stages. The ease and versatility of the method actuates the fruit fly as an appealing model in proteomic and post-translational modification studies and it enlarges potential metabolic applications based on heavy amino acid diets.",

    "abstract": "Organisms survive in naturally fluctuating environments by responding to long-term signals, such as seasonality, by filtering out short-term noise. DNA methylation has been considered a stable epigenetic mark but has also been reported to change in response to experimental manipulations of biotic and abiotic factors. However, it is unclear how they behave in natural environments. Here, we analyzed seasonal patterns of genome-wide DNA methylation at a single-base resolution using a single clone from a natural population of the perennial Arabidopsis halleri. The genome-wide pattern of DNA methylation was primarily stable, and most of the repetitive regions were methylated across the year. Although the proportion was small, we detected seasonally methylated cytosines (SeMCs) in the genome. SeMCs in the different contexts showed distinct seasonal patterns of methylation. SeMCs in CHH context were detected predominantly at repetitive sequences in intergenic regions. Additionally, we found that CHH methylation within AhgFLC locus showed a seasonal pattern that was negatively associated with changes in gene expression. Gene-body CG methylation (gbM) itself was generally stable across seasons, but the levels of gbM were positively associated with seasonal stability of RNA expression of the genes. These results suggest the existence of two distinct aspects of DNA methylation in natural environments: sources of epigenetic variation and epigenetic marks for stable gene expression.",

Using multiple-regression representational similarity analysis of fMRI data, in which we accounted for variability due to major action-related features (body parts, scenes, movements, objects), we found that the semantic dissimilarity structure was best captured by patterns of activation in the lateral occipitotemporal cortex (LOTC) and the left posterior inferior parietal lobe (IPL). Together, our results demonstrate that the organization of observed actions in the LOTC and the IPL resembles the organizing principles used by participants to classify actions behaviorally, in line with the view that these regions are crucial for accessing the meaning of actions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBulk RNA-Seq has been extensively utilized to investigate the molecular changes accompanying motor neuron degeneration in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). However, due to the heterogeneity and degenerating phenotype of the neurons, it has proved difficult to assign specific changes to neuronal subtypes and identify which factors drive these changes. Consequently, we have utilized single cell transcriptomics of degenerating motor neurons derived from ALS patients to uncover key transcriptional drivers of dysfunctional pathways.\n\nResultsSingle cell analysis of spinal neuronal cultures derived from SOD1 E100G ALS and isogenic iPSCs allowed us to classify cells into neural subtypes including motor neurons and interneurons. Differential expression analysis between disease and control motor neurons revealed downregulation of genes involved in synaptic structure, neuronal cytoskeleton, mitochondrial function and autophagy. Interestingly, interneurons did not show similar suppression of these homeostatic functions. Single cell expression data enabled us to derive a context-specific transcriptional network relevant to ALS neurons. Master regulator analysis based on this network identified core transcriptional factors driving the ALS MN gene dysregulation. Specifically, we identified activation of SMAD2, a downstream mediator of the TGF-{beta} signalling pathway as a potential driving factor of ALS motor neuron degeneration. Our phenotypic analysis further confirmed that an activated TGF-{beta} signalling is major driver of motor neuron loss in SOD1 ALS. Importantly, expression analysis of TGF{beta} target genes and computational analysis of publicly available datasets indicates that activation of TGF{beta} signalling may be a common mechanism shared between SOD1, FUS and sporadic ALS.\n\nConclusionsOur results demonstrate the utility of single cell transcriptomics in mapping disease-relevant gene regulatory networks driving neurodegeneration in ALS motor neurons. We find that ALS-associated mutant SOD1 targets transcriptional networks that perturb motor neuron homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe genus Oryzias is constituted of 35 medaka-fish species each exhibiting various ecological, morphological and physiological peculiarities and adaptations. Beyond of being a comprehensive phylogenetic group for studying intra-genus evolution of several traits like sex determination, behaviour, morphology or adaptation through comparative genomic approaches, all medaka species share many advantages of experimental model organisms including small size and short generation time, transparent embryos and genome editing tools for reverse and forward genetic studies. The Java medaka, Oryzias javanicus, is one of the two species of medaka perfectly adapted for living in brackish/sea-waters. Being an important component of the mangrove ecosystem, O. javanicus is also used as a valuable marine test-fish for ecotoxicology studies. Here, we sequenced and assembled the whole genome of O. javanicus, and anticipate this resource will be catalytic for a wide range of comparative genomic, phylogenetic and functional studies.\\n\\nFindingsComplementary sequencing approaches including long-read technology and data integration with a genetic map allowed the final assembly of 908 Mbp of the O. javanicus genome. Further analyses estimate that the O. javanicus genome contains 33% of repeat sequences and has a heterozygosity of 0.96%. The achieved draft assembly contains 525 scaffolds with a total length of 809.7 Mbp, a N50 of 6.3 Mbp and a L50 of 37 scaffolds. We identified 21454 expressed transcripts for a total transcriptome size of 57, 146, 583 bps.\\n\\nConclusionsWe provide here a high-quality draft genome assembly of the euryhaline Javafish medaka, and give emphasis on the evolutionary adaptation to salinity.",
