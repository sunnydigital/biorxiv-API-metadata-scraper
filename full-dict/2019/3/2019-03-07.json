    "abstract": "Individuals with severe, undiagnosed developmental disorders (DDs) are enriched for damaging de novo mutations (DNMs) in developmentally important genes. We exome sequenced 4,293 families with individuals with DDs, and meta-analysed these data with published data on 3,287 individuals with similar disorders. We show that the most significant factors influencing the diagnostic yield of de novo mutations are the sex of the affected individual, the relatedness of their parents and the age of both father and mother. We identified 94 genes enriched for damaging de novo mutation at genome-wide significance (P < 7 x 10-7), including 14 genes for which compelling data for causation was previously lacking. We have characterised the phenotypic diversity among these genetic disorders. We demonstrate that, at current cost differentials, exome sequencing has much greater power than genome sequencing for novel gene discovery in genetically heterogeneous disorders. We estimate that 42% of our cohort carry pathogenic DNMs (single nucleotide variants and indels) in coding sequences, with approximately half operating by a loss-of-function mechanism, and the remainder resulting in altered-function (e.g. activating, dominant negative). We established that most haplo insufficient developmental disorders have already been identified, but that many altered-function disorders remain to be discovered. Extrapolating from the DDD cohort to the general population, we estimate that developmental disorders caused by DNMs have an average birth prevalence of 1 in 213 to 1 in 448 (0.22-0.47% of live births), depending on parental age.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "We describe the rapid and reproducible acquisition of quantitative proteome maps for the NCI-60 cancer cell lines and their use to reveal cancer biology and drug response determinants. Proteome datasets for the 60 cell lines were acquired in duplicate within 30 working days using pressure cycling technology and SWATH mass spectrometry. We consistently quantified 3,171 proteotypic proteins annotated in the SwissProt database across all cell lines, generating a data matrix with 0.1% missing values, allowing analyses of protein complexes and pathway activities across all the cancer cells. Systematic and integrative analysis of the genetic variation, mRNA expression and proteomic data of the NCI-60 cancer cell lines uncovered complementarity between different types of molecular data in the prediction of the response to 240 drugs. We additionally identified novel proteomic drug response determinants for clinically relevant chemotherapeutic and targeted therapies. We anticipate that this study represents a significant advance toward the translational application of proteotypes, which reveal biological insights that are easily missed in the absence of proteomic data.",

    "abstract": "Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is common and disabling, but its neural pathophysiology remains unclear. Functional brain network studies in MDD have largely had limited statistical power and data analysis approaches have varied widely. The REST-meta-MDD Project of resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI) addresses these issues. The 25 research groups in China composing the REST-meta-MDD Project contributed R-fMRI data of 1,300 patients with MDD and 1,128 normal controls (NCs). The data were preprocessed locally with a standardized protocol prior to aggregated group analyses. We focused on functional connectivity (FC) within the default mode network (DMN), frequently reported to show increased FC in MDD. We found decreased instead of increased DMN FC when comparing 848 MDDs with 794 NCs from 17 sites after data exclusion. We found FC reduction only in recurrent MDD, not in first-episode drug-naive MDD. Decreased DMN FC was associated with medication usage but not with MDD duration. DMN FC was also positively related to symptom severity but only in recurrent MDDs. Exploratory analyses also revealed alterations of local intrinsic activity in MDD. We confirmed the key role of DMN in MDD but found reduced rather than increased FC within the DMN. Future studies should test whether decreased DMN FC mediates treatment response. This manuscript announces the publicly available resting-state fMRI indices of the REST-meta-MDD consortium shared via the R-fMRI Maps Project.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTFunctional connectivity within the default mode network in major depressive disorder patients has been frequently reported abnormal but with contradicting directions in previous small sample size studies. By creating the REST-meta-MDD consortium containing neuroimaging data of 1,300 depressed patients and 1,128 normal controls from 25 research groups in China, we found decreased default mode network functional connectivity in depressed patients, driven by patients with recurrent depression, and associated with current medication treatment but not with disease duration. These findings suggest that default mode network functional connectivity remains a prime target for understanding the pathophysiology of depression, with particular relevance to revealing mechanisms of effective treatments.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning algorithms can be fooled by small well-designed adversarial perturbations. This is reminiscent of cellular decision-making where ligands (called antagonists) prevent correct signalling, like in early immune recognition. We draw a formal analogy between neural networks used in machine learning and models of cellular decision-making (adaptive proofreading). We apply attacks from machine learning to simple decision-making models, and show explicitly the correspondence to antagonism by weakly bound ligands. Such antagonism is absent in more nonlinear models, which inspired us to implement a biomimetic defence in neural networks filtering out adversarial perturbations. We then apply a gradient-descent approach from machine learning to different cellular decision-making models, and we reveal the existence of two regimes characterized by the presence or absence of a critical point for the gradient. This critical point causes the strongest antagonists to lie close to the decision boundary. This is validated in the loss landscapes of robust neural networks and cellular decision-making models, and observed experimentally for immune cells. For both regimes, we explain how associated defence mechanisms shape the geometry of the loss landscape, and why different adversarial attacks are effective in different regimes. Our work connects evolved cellular decision-making to machine learning, and motivates the design of a general theory of adversarial perturbations, both for in vivo and in silico systems.",

    "abstract": "Ubiquitin (Ub) and its E3 ligases play diverse biological roles, from proteasomal degradation to innate immune signaling. The conventional view posits that E3 ligases function primarily through conjugating Ub to their substrate molecules. We report here that RIPLET, an essential E3 ligase in antiviral immunity, promotes the antiviral signaling activity of the viral RNA receptor RIG-I through both Ub-dependent and -independent manners. RIPLET utilizes its dimeric structure and the bivalent binding mode to preferentially recognize RIG-I preoligomerized on dsRNA. RIPLET can also adopt an alternative binding mode for filamentous oligomers of RIG-I assembled on longer dsRNAs, cross-bridging RIG-I filaments in both ubiquitin-dependent and-independent manners. The resultant receptor clustering leads to the formation of aggregate-like cytosolic granules and the stimulation of RIG-I-mediated antiviral signaling in a RNA-length dependent manner. These observations show the unexpected role of an E3 ligase as a co-receptor that directly participates in receptor oligomerization and ligand discrimination. This study also highlights previously unrecognized mechanisms by which an E3 ligase induces receptor clustering and signal amplification, and offers insights into the unique cellular function of membrane-less granule assembly.\\n\\nOne-sentence summaryRIPLET functions as a molecular glue to assemble signaling scaffolds for the antiviral innate immune receptor RIG-I.",

    "abstract": "Gamma range activity in human visual cortex is believed to play a major role in cognitive functions, such as selective attention. Although recent studies have revealed substantial variability in gamma activity, its origins are still unclear.\\n\\nWe investigated whether variability in stimulus-induced gamma activity is related to the spontaneous dynamics of resting-state networks using Hidden Markov Modelling. The magnetoencephalogram (MEG) of 15 healthy participants was recorded at rest and while they were performing a task involving a visual stimulus inducing strong, narrow-band gamma activity. Brain states were inferred from the tasks baseline periods and from resting-state recordings, respectively.\\n\\nOur results show how network states are related to the amplitude of stimulus-induced gamma responses. Across trials, we found an association between the amplitude of gamma responses and the brain state occurring immediately prior to stimulus presentation. Strong gamma responses followed a state characterized by prominent delta/theta oscillations in parieto-occipital regions and comparably weak alpha activity. Across subjects, the overall probability of visiting this state in the baseline period, i.e. the individual preference for this state, correlated positively with the amplitude of the trial-averaged gamma response. Remarkably, this relationship persisted when states were inferred from resting-state recordings rather than the tasks baseline.\\n\\nIn summary, both within- and across-subject variability in stimulus-induced gamma activity can in part be explained by the ongoing dynamics of whole-brain network states. Fast, pre-stimulus modulations of brain states account for differences between trials while stable, individual state preferences account for differences between subjects.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the relationship between the genome of a cell and its phenotype is a central problem in precision medicine. Nonetheless, genotype-to-phenotype prediction comes with great challenges for machine learning algorithms that limit their use in this setting. The high dimensionality of the data tends to hinder generalization and challenges the scalability of most learning algorithms. Additionally, most algorithms produce models that are complex and difficult to interpret. We alleviate these limitations by proposing strong performance guarantees, based on sample compression theory, for rule-based learning algorithms that produce highly interpretable models. We show that these guarantees can be leveraged to accelerate learning and improve model interpretability. Our approach is validated through an application to the genomic prediction of antimicrobial resistance, an important public health concern. Highly accurate models were obtained for 12 species and 56 antibiotics, and their interpretation revealed known resistance mechanisms, as well as some potentially new ones. An open-source disk-based implementation that is both memory and computationally efficient is provided with this work. The implementation is turnkey, requires no prior knowledge of machine learning, and is complemented by comprehensive tutorials.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities play an important role in driving the dynamics of aquatic ecosys-tems. As difficulties in DNA sequencing faced by microbial ecologists are continuously being reduced, sample collection methods and the choice of DNA extraction protocols are becoming more critical to the outcome of any sequencing study. In the present study, I added a manual bead-beating step in the protocol using a DNeasy(R) Blood & Tissue kit for DNA extraction from a filter cartridge (Sterivex filter cartridge) without breaking the cartridge unit (\\\"Beads\\\" method), and compared its performance with those of two other protocols that used the filter cartridge (\\\"NoBeads\\\" method, which was similar to the Beads method but without the bead-beating step, and \\\"PowerSoil\\\" method, which followed the manual of the PowerSoil DNA extraction kit after breaking apart the filter cartridge). Water samples were collected from lake and river ecosystems in Japan, and DNA was extracted using the three protocols. Then, the V4 region of prokaryotic 16S rRNA genes was amplified. In addition, internal standard DNAs were included in the DNA library preparation process to estimate the number of 16S rRNA gene copies. The DNA library was sequenced using Illumina MiSeq, and sequences were analyzed using the amplicon sequence variant (ASV) approach (DADA2). I found that, 1) the total DNA yields were highest with the Beads method, 2) the number of ASVs (a proxy for species richness) was also highest with the Beads method, 3) overall community compositions were significantly different among the three methods, and 4) the number of method-specific ASVs was highest with the Beads method. In conclusion, the inclusion of a bead-beating step performed inside the filter cartridge increased the DNA yield as well as the number of prokaryotic ASVs detected compared with the other two methods. Performing the bead-beating step inside the filter cartridge causes no dramatic increase in either handling time or processing cost. Therefore, this method has the potential to become one of the major choices when one aims to extract aquatic microbial DNAs.",

    "abstract": "The European common cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, is used extensively in biological and biomedical research yet its microbiome remains poorly characterized. We analyzed the microbiota of the digestive tract, gills, and skin in mariculture-raised S. officinalis using a combination of 16s rRNA amplicon sequencing and fluorescence spectral imaging. Sequencing revealed a highly simplified microbiota consisting largely of two single bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) of Vibrionaceae and Piscirickettsiaceae. The esophagus was dominated by a single ASV of the genus Vibrio. Imaging revealed a striking organization of bacteria distributed in a discrete layer that lines the esophagus. Imaging with specific probes confirmed the identity of these bacteria as Vibrionaceae. This Vibrio was also abundant in the microbiota of the stomach, cecum, and intestine, but occurred at lower density and in the lumen rather than in a discrete layer; it was present in only trace proportions in tank water and in the microbiome of shrimp that were used as feed for the cuttlefish. These Vibrio were resilient to treatment of animals with the commonly-used antibiotic, enrofloxacin. The gills were colonized by a single ASV in the family Piscirickettsiaceae, which imaging visualized as small clusters of cells. We conclude that bacteria belonging to the Gammaproteobacteria, especially Vibrionaceae, are the major symbionts of the cuttlefish Sepia officinalis cultured from eggs in captivity, and that the esophagus and gills are major colonization sites.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEMicrobes can play critical roles in the physiology of their animal hosts, as evidenced in cephalopods by the role of Vibrio (Aliivibrio) fischeri in the light organ of the bobtail squid and the role of Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria in the reproductive system and egg defense in a variety of cephalopods. We sampled the cuttlefish microbiome throughout the digestive tract, gills, and skin and found dense colonization of an unexpected site, the esophagus, by a microbe of the genus Vibrio, as well as colonization of gills by Piscirickettsiaceae. We found these associations to be resilient to the treatment of animals with a common antibiotic, enrofloxacin. This finding expands the range of organisms and body sites known to be associated with Vibrio and is of potential significance for understanding host-symbiont associations as well as for understanding and maintaining the health of cephalopods in mariculture.",

    "abstract": "AstractLong distance migration can increase lifetime fitness, but can be costly, incurring increased energetic expenses and higher mortality risks. Stopover and other en route behaviors allow animals to rest and replenish energy stores and avoid or mitigate other hazards during migration. Some animals, such as soaring birds, can subsidize the energetic costs of migration by extracting energy from flowing air. However, it is unclear how these energy sources affect or interact with behavioral processes and stopover in long-distance soaring migrants. To understand these behaviors and the effects of processes that might enhance use of flight subsidies, we developed a flexible mechanistic model to predict how flight subsidies drive migrant behavior and movement processes. The novel modelling framework incorporated time-varying parameters informed by environmental covariates to characterize a continuous range of behaviors during migration. This model framework was fit to GPS satellite telemetry data collected from a large soaring and opportunist foraging bird, the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), during migration in western North America. Fitted dynamic model parameters revealed a clear circadian rhythm in eagle movement and behavior, which was directly related to thermal uplift. Behavioral budgets were complex, however, with evidence for a joint migrating/foraging behavior, resembling a slower paced fly-and-forage migration, which could facilitate efficient refueling while still ensuring migration progress. In previous work, ecological and foraging conditions are normally considered to be the key aspects of stopover location quality, but taxa that can tap energy sources from moving fluids to drive migratory locomotion, such as the golden eagle, may pace migration based on both foraging opportunities and available flight subsidies.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptomic profiling is an immensly powerful hypothesis generating tool. Whether one is comparing an experimental versus control condition or collecting transcriptomes from cohorts of disease tissue, it is often necessary to determine which transcription factors (TFs) and cofactors drive programs of gene expression in the datasets. Most available tools rely on searching for TF binding motifs near promoters of genes in a gene set. This approach can work well for TFs with extended recognition elements but is less useful for shorter elements and does not work at all for cofactors. The Encyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) archives ChIPseq tracks of 169 TFs and cofactors assayed in 91 cells lines. The algorithm presented herein, Multiple Aligned Genomic Integration of ChIP (MAGIC), uses ENCODE ChIPseq data to look for statistical enrichment of TFs and cofactors in gene bodies and flanking regions in gene sets. When compared to a commonly used web resource o-Possum, MAGIC was able to more accurately predict TFs and cofactors that drive gene changes in 3 settings: 1) A cell line expressing or lacking REST, 2) Breast tumors divided along PAM50 designations and 3) Whole brain samples from WT mice or mice lacking CTCF in a particular neuronal subtype. In summary, MAGIC is a standalone application that runs on OSX machines and has a simple interface that produces meaningful predictions of which TFs and cofactors are enriched in a gene set.",

    "abstract": "Wilson disease (WD) is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism caused by variants in the copper transporting P-type ATPase gene ATP7B. Estimates for WD population prevalence vary with 1 in 30,000 generally quoted. However, some genetic studies have reported much higher prevalence rates. The aim of this study was to estimate the population prevalence of WD and the pathogenicity/penetrance of WD variants by determining the frequency of ATP7B variants in a genomic sequence database. A catalogue of WD-associated ATP7B variants was constructed and then frequency information for these was extracted from the gnomAD dataset. Pathogenicity of variants was assessed by (a) comparing gnomAD allele frequencies against the number of reports for variants in the WD literature and (b) using variant effect prediction algorithms. 231 WD-associated ATP7B variants were identified in the gnomAD dataset, giving an initial estimated population prevalence of around 1 in 2400. After exclusion of WD-associated ATP7B variants with predicted low penetrance, the revised estimate showed a prevalence of around 1 in 20,000, with higher rates in the Asian and Ashkenazi Jewish populations. Reanalysis of other recent genetic studies using our penetrance criteria also predicted lower population prevalences for WD in the UK and France than had been reported. Our results suggest that differences in variant penetrance can explain the discrepancy between reported epidemiological and genetic prevalences of WD. They also highlight the challenge in defining penetrance when assigning causality to some ATP7B variants.",

    "abstract": "Exploring complex biological systems requires adequate knowledge of the systems underlying wiring diagram but not its specific functional forms. Thus, exploration actually requires the concepts and approaches delivered by structure-based network control, which investigates the controllability of complex networks through a minimum set of input nodes. Traditional structure-based control methods focus on the structure of complex systems with linear dynamics and may not match the meaning of control well in some biological systems. Here we took into consideration the nonlinear dynamics of some biological networks and formalized the nonlinear control problem of undirected dynamical networks (NCU). Then, we designed and implemented a novel and general graphic-theoretic algorithm (NCUA) from the perspective of the feedback vertex set to discover the possible minimum sets of the input nodes in controlling the network state. We applied our NCUA to both synthetic networks and real-world networks to investigate how the network parameters, such as the scaling exponent and the degree heterogeneity, affect the control characteristics of networks with nonlinear dynamics. The NCUA was applied to analyze the patient-specific molecular networks corresponding to patients across multiple datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which demonstrates the advantages of the nonlinear control method to characterize and quantify the patient-state change over the other state-of-the-art linear control methods. Thus, our model opens a new way to control the undesired transition of cancer states and provides a powerful tool for theoretical research on network control, especially in biological fields.\\n\\nAuthor summaryComplex biological systems usually have nonlinear dynamics, such as the biological gene (protein) interaction network and gene co-expression networks. However, most of the structure-based network control methods focus on the structure of complex systems with linear dynamics. Thus, the ultimate purpose to control biological networks is still too complicated to be directly solved by such network control methods. We currently lack a framework to control the biological networks with nonlinear and undirected dynamics theoretically and computationally. Here, we discuss the concept of the nonlinear control problem of undirected dynamical networks (NCU) and present the novel graphic-theoretic algorithm from the perspective of a feedback vertex set for identifying the possible sets with minimum input nodes in controlling the networks. The NCUA searches the minimum set of input nodes to drive the network from the undesired attractor to the desired attractor, which is different from conventional linear network control, such as that found in the Maximum Matching Sets (MMS) and Minimum Dominating Sets (MDS) algorithms. In this work, we evaluated the NCUA on multiple synthetic scale-free networks and real complex networks with nonlinear dynamics and found the novel control characteristics of the undirected scale-free networks. We used the NCUA to thoroughly investigate the sample-specific networks and their nonlinear controllability corresponding to cancer samples from TCGA which are enriched with known driver genes and known drug target as controls of pathologic phenotype transitions. We found that our NCUA control method has a better predicted performance for indicating and quantifying the patient biological system changes than that of the state-of-the-art linear control methods. Our approach provides a powerful tool for theoretical research on network control, especially in a range of biological fields.",

PCR-based profiling of centromeres revealed widespread heterogeneity of centromeric and pericentromeric sequences in cancer cells and tissue as compared to healthy counterparts. Quantitative reductions in select centromeric core and pericentromeric markers were observed in neoplastic samples as compared to healthy counterparts. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis of a pericentromeric endogenous retrovirus amplified by PCR revealed possible gene conversion events occurring at numerous pericentromeric loci in the setting of malignancy.

We found that global genetic ablation of EHD2 in mice led to increased fat deposits in several organs. This organismic phenotype was paralleled at the cellular level by an increased lipid uptake via a CD36-dependent pathway, an elevated number of detached caveolae and higher caveolar mobility. Following a high fat diet, various enzymes involved in de novo fatty acid synthesis were down-regulated in EHD2 KO mice. Furthermore, EHD2 expression itself was down-regulated in the visceral fat of two obese mouse models and in diet-induced obesity. Thus, EHD2 controls a cell-autonomous, caveolae-dependent lipid uptake pathway, implicating a role of EHD2 in fat accumulation and obesity.",

Data cleaning is more difficult in multiparent populations (experimental crosses derived from more than two founder strains), as individual SNP markers have incomplete information. We describe our process for cleaning SNP microarray genotype data from Diversity Outbred (DO) mice, illustrated with genotype data from the MegaMUGA array on a set of 291 DO mice. We first consider the proportion of missing genotypes in each mouse, as an indicator of sample quality. We use microarray probe intensities for SNPs on the X and Y chromosomes to check mouse sex. We use the proportion of matching SNP genotypes in pairs of mice to detect sample duplicates. We use a hidden Markov model to calculate genotype probabilities across the genome for each mouse, which we use to estimate the number of crossovers in each mouse, and to identify potential genotyping errors. The estimated genotyping error rate, by mouse sample and by SNP marker, is a useful diagnostic. We also consider the SNP genotype frequencies by mouse and by marker, with markers grouped according to the minor allele frequency in the founder strains. For markers with high apparent error rates, a scatterplot of the allele intensities from the microarray, colored by both observed and predicted genotypes, can be revealing about the underlying cause. But the detection of low-quality samples is more important than the detection of low-quality markers.",

However, there is considerable evidence for selfish genetic elements that distort the behaviour of individuals to increase their own transmission. How can we reconcile these opposing notions? We use a combination of population genetics, agent-based simulation, and game theory to model the evolution of both selfish genetic elements and genes that could suppress their distortion. We found that: (1) suppressor genes are more likely to be favoured when selfish genetic elements cause greater distortion; (2) selection on selfish genetic elements favours the evolution of greater distortion, making them more likely to be suppressed. We found these same results when examining an abstract model designed to illuminate the general principles, and models for three specific scenarios: an X chromosome driver, an imprinted gene, and a bacterial plasmid. Our results suggest that selection on selfish genetic elements will often drive coevolution with suppressors in a way that removes the impact of genetic conflict at the level of the individual.",

It has been shown that the Wall Teichoic Acid (WTA) may be an important drug target acting on antibiotic-resistant cells. The UDP-N-Acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase, MnaA, is one of the first enzymes on the pathway for the biosynthesis of the WTA. Here, detailed molecular dynamics simulations of S. aureus MnaA were used to characterize the conformational changes that occur in the presence of UDP and UDP-GlcNac and also the energetic landscape associated with these changes. Using different simulation techniques, such as ABMD and GAMD, it was possible to assess the energetic profile for the protein with and without ligands in its active site. We found that there is a dynamic energy landscape that has its minimum changed by the presence of the ligands, with a closed structure of the enzyme being more frequently observed for the bound state while the unbound enzyme favors an opened conformation. Further structural analysis indicated that positively charged amino acids associated with UDP and UDP-GlcNac interactions play a major role in the enzyme opening movement. Finally, the energy landscape profiled in this work provides important conclusions for the design of inhibitor candidates targeting S. aureus MnaA.",

GAS secretes EndoS, an endoglycosidase able to specifically cleave the conserved N-glycan on human IgG antibodies. In vitro, removal of this glycan impairs IgG effector functions but its relevance to GAS infection in vivo is unclear. Using targeted mass spectrometry, we were able to characterize the effects of EndoS on host IgG glycosylation during the course of natural infections in human patients. We found substantial IgG glycan hydrolysis locally at site of infection as well as systemically in the most severe cases. Using these findings we were able to set up appropriate model systems to demonstrate decreased resistance to phagocytic killing of GAS lacking EndoS in vitro, as well as decreased virulence in a mouse model of invasive infection. This study represents the first described example of specific bacterial IgG glycan hydrolysis during infection and highlights the importance of IgG glycan hydrolysis for streptococcal pathogenesis. We thereby offer new insights into the mechanism of immune evasion employed by this pathogen with clear implications for treatment of severe GAS infections and future efforts at vaccine development.",

To address this, we characterised soil macroinvertebrate communities and their activities in ADEs, comparing them with adjacent reference soils under forests and agriculture, at nine archaeological sites. We found 667 morphospecies and a tenacious pre-Columbian biodiversity footprint, with 40% of species found exclusively in ADEs. Soil biological activity was higher in ADEs than in adjacent soils, and associated with higher biomass and richness of organisms known to engineer the ecosystem. We show that these habitats have unique species pools, but that contemporary land-use causes nutrient loss and threatens their diversity. Both past and present human activities alter biodiversity and its distribution in Amazonia, and further efforts are needed to recognize and preserve these ADEs and their biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "Classifying the mechanisms of antibiotic failure has led to the development of new treatment strategies for killing bacteria. Among the currently described mechanisms, which include resistance, persistence and tolerance, we propose bacterial defiance as a form of antibiotic failure specific to prodrugs. As a prototypic model of a bacteria-activated prodrug, we construct cationic antimicrobial peptides (AMP), which are charge neutralized until activated by a bacterial protease. This construct successfully eliminated the vast majority of bacteria populations, while localizing activity to bacterial membranes and maintaining low active drug concentration. However, we observed defiant bacteria populations, which survive in the presence of identical drug concentration and exposure time. Using a multi-rate kinetic feedback model, we show that bacteria switch between susceptibility and defiance under clinically relevant environmental (e.g., hyperthermia) and genetic (e.g., downregulated protease expression) conditions. From this model, we derive a dimensionless quantity (Bacterial Advantage Heuristic, BAH) - representing the balance between bacterial proliferation and prodrug activation - that perfectly classifies bacteria as defiant or susceptible across a broad range of conditions. To apply this concept to other classes of prodrugs, we expand this model to include both linear and nonlinear terms and use general pharmacokinetic parameters (e.g., half-life, EC50, etc.). Taken together, this model reveals an analogous dimensionless quantity (General Advantage Key, GAK), which can applied to prodrugs with different activation mechanisms. We envision that these studies will enable the development of more effective prodrugs to combat antibiotic resistance.",

    "abstract": "In mammalian olfaction, inhalation drives the temporal patterning of neural activity that underlies early olfactory processing, and a single inhalation of odorant is sufficient for odor perception. However, how the neural circuits that process incoming olfactory information are activated in the context of inhalation-linked dynamics remains poorly understood. To better understand early olfactory processing in vivo, we used an artificial inhalation paradigm combined with two-photon calcium imaging to compare the dynamics of activity evoked by odorant inhalation across major cell types of the mouse olfactory bulb. Transgenic models and cell-type specific genetic tools were used to express GCaMP6f or jRGECO1a in mitral and tufted cell subpopulations, olfactory sensory neurons and two major juxtaglomerular interneuron classes, and responses to a single inhalation of odorant were compared. Activity in all cell types was strongly linked to inhalation, and all cell types showed some variance in the latency, rise-times and durations of their inhalation-linked response patterns. The dynamics of juxtaglomerular interneuron activity closely matched that of sensory neuron inputs, while mitral and tufted cells showed the highest diversity in dynamics, with a range of latencies and durations that could not be accounted for by heterogeneity in the dynamics of sensory input. Surprisingly, temporal response patterns of mitral and superficial tufted cells were highly overlapping such that these two subpopulations could not be distinguished on the basis of their inhalation-linked dynamics, with the exception of a subpopulation of superficial tufted cells expressing the peptide transmitter cholecystokinin. Overall, these results support a model in which diversity in inhalation-linked patterning of OB output arises first at the level of OSN inputs to the OB and is enhanced by feedforward inhibition from juxtaglomerular interneurons which differentially impacts different subpopulations of OB output neurons.",

    "abstract": "Memories can persist for decades but how they are stably encoded in individual and groups of neurons is not known. To investigate how a familiar environment is encoded in CA1 neurons over time we implanted bilateral microendoscopes in transgenic mice to image the activity of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus over weeks. Most of the neurons (90 %) are active every day, however, the response of neurons to specific cues changes across days. Approximately 40 % of place and time cells lose fields between two days; however, on timescales longer than two days the neuronal pattern changes at a rate of 1 % for each additional day. Despite continuous changes, field responses are more resilient, with place/time cells recovering their fields after a 10-day period of no task or following CA1 damage. Recovery of these neuronal patterns is characterized by transient changes in firing fields which ultimately converge to the original representation. Unlike individual neurons, groups of neurons with inter and intrahemispheric synchronous activity form stable place and time fields across days. Neurons whose activity was synchronous with a large group of neurons were more likely to preserve their responses to place or time across multiple days.

Optogenetic activation of cortex is also reliably demonstrated through the optically transparent ECoG grids acutely placed on the thinned skull. Finally, spatially distinct electrophysiological recordings were evident on {micro}ECoG electrodes placed on a thinned skull separated by 500-750{micro}m, as assessed by stimulation evoked responses using optogenetic activation of cortex as well as invasive and epidermal stimulation of the sciatic and median nerve at chronic time points.

    "abstract": "The genetic control of gene expression is a core component of human physiology. For the past several years, transcriptome-wide association studies have leveraged large datasets of linked genotype and RNA sequencing information to create a powerful gene-based test of association that has been used in dozens of studies. While numerous discoveries have been made, the populations in the training data are overwhelmingly of European descent, and little is known about the generalizability of these models to other populations. Here, we test for cross-population generalizability of gene expression prediction models using a dataset of African American individuals with RNA-Seq data in whole blood. We find that the default models trained in large datasets such as GTEx and DGN fare poorly in African Americans, with a notable reduction in prediction accuracy when compared to European Americans. We replicate these limitations in cross-population generalizability using the five populations in the GEUVADIS dataset. Via realistic simulations of both populations and gene expression, we show that accurate cross-population generalizability of transcriptome prediction only arises when eQTL architecture is substantially shared across populations. In contrast, models with non-identical eQTLs showed patterns similar to real-world data. Therefore, generating RNA-Seq data in diverse populations is a critical step towards multi-ethnic utility of gene expression prediction.\n\nAuthor summaryAdvances in RNA sequencing technology have reduced the cost of measuring gene expression at a genome-wide level. However, sequencing enough human RNA samples for adequately-powered disease association studies remains prohibitively costly. To this end, modern transcriptome-wide association analysis tools leverage existing paired genotype-expression datasets by creating models to predict gene expression using genotypes. These predictive models enable researchers to perform cost-effective association tests with gene expression in independently genotyped samples. However, most of these models use European reference data, and the extent to which gene expression prediction models work across populations is not fully resolved. We observe that these models predict gene expression worse than expected in a dataset of African-Americans when derived from European-descent individuals. Using simulations, we show that gene expression predictive model performance depends on both the amount of shared genotype predictors as well as the genetic relatedness between populations. Our findings suggest a need to carefully select reference populations for prediction and point to a pressing need for more genetically diverse genotype-expression datasets.",

Double mutation of Kmt2a and Kdm5c clearly reversed dendritic morphology, key behavioral traits including aggression, and partially corrected altered transcriptomes and H3K4me landscapes.

    "abstract": "In chickens, as in most amniotes, the first morphogenetic event in ovary differentiation is the formation of two distinct domains: a steroidogenic core, the medulla, overlain by the germ cell niche, the cortex. This process normally starts immediately after sex determination in the ZW embryos, substantially before the progression of germ cells into meiosis. In order to address the extent to which the cortical domain depends on intrinsic or extrinsic factors, we generated models of gonadal intersex by mixing ZW (female) and ZZ (male) cells in gonadal chimeras, or by altering estrogen levels of ZZ and ZW embryos in ovo. We found that both chomosomally female and male cells can be induced to form the cortical domain and that this can form relatively independently of the phenotypic sex of the medulla as long as estrogen is provided. We also show that the cortex promoting activity of estrogen signalling is mediated via Estrogen Receptor alpha within the left gonad epithelium. Therefore, either a ZW or ZZ cortical domain can provide an adequate niche to allow the germ cells to progress into meiosis. However, the presence of a medulla with an \\\"intersex\\\" or male phenotype may compromise this progression, causing cortical germ cells to remain in an immature state in the embryo.",

The lower boundary of the paramos is defined by the upper forest line, which is known to be highly responsive to temperature. Here we reconstruct the extent and connectivity of paramos over the last 1 million years (Myr) by reconstructing the UFL from the long fossil pollen record of Funza09, Colombia, and applying it to spatial mapping on modern topographies across the Northern Andes for 752 time slices. Data provide an estimate of how often and for how long different elevations were occupied by paramos and estimates their connectivity to provide insights into the role of topography in biogeographic patterns of paramos.\\n\\nResultsOur findings show that connectivity amongst paramos of the Northern Andes was highly dynamic, both within and across mountain ranges. Connectivity amongst paramos peaked during extreme glacial periods but intermediate cool stadials and mild interstadials dominated the climate system. These variable degrees of connectivity through time result in what we term the  flickering connectivity system. We provide a visualization (video) to showcase this phenomenon. Patterns of connectivity in the Northern Andes contradict patterns observed in other mountain ranges of differing topographies.\\n\\nMain conclusionsPleistocene climate change was the driver of significant elevational and spatial shifts in paramos causing dynamic changes in habitat connectivity across and within all mountain ranges. Some generalities emerge, including the fact that connectivity was greatest during the most ephemeral of times. However, the timing, duration and degree of connectivity varied substantially among mountain ranges depending on their topographic configuration. The flickering connectivity system of the paramos uncovers the dynamic settings in which evolutionary radiations shaped the most diverse alpine biome on Earth.",

Complex behaviors can be characterized as decision making: the ability to process the incoming information via an intracellular network and act upon this information to choose appropriate strategies. Motility is one such behavior that has been the focus many modeling efforts in the past. Our aim is to reduce the chemotactic behavior in E. coli to its molecular constituents in order to paint a comprehensive and end-to-end picture of this intricate behavior. We utilize a hierarchical approach, consisting of three layers, to achieve this goal: at the first level, chemical reactions involved in chemotaxis are simulated. In the second level, the chemical reactions give rise to the mechanical movement of six independent flagella. At the last layer, the two lower layers are combined to allow a digital bacterium to receive information from its environment and swim through it with verve. Our results are in concert with the experimental studies concerning the motility of E. coli cells. In addition, we show that our detailed model of chemotaxis is reducible to a non-homogeneous Markov process.",

    "abstract": "Independent component analysis has been widely applied to brain imaging and genetic data analyses for its ability to identify interpretable latent sources. Nevertheless, leveraging source sparsity in a more granular way may further improve its ability to optimize the solution for certain data types. For this purpose, we propose a sparse infomax algorithm based on nonlinear Hoyer projection, leveraging both sparsity and statistical independence of latent sources. The proposed algorithm iteratively updates the unmixing matrix by infomax (for independence) and the sources by Hoyer projection (for sparsity), feeding the sparse sources back as input data for the next iteration. Consequently, sparseness propagates effectively through infomax iterations, producing sources with more desirable properties. Simulation results on both brain imaging and genetic data demonstrate that the proposed algorithm yields improved pattern recovery, particularly under low signal-to-noise ratio conditions, as well as improved sparseness compared to traditional infomax.",

    "abstract": "A single incidence of whole-genome doubling (WGD) is common early in tumorigenesis. In addition to increasing ploidy, WGD doubles centrosome number. In the ensuing mitoses, excess centrosomes form a multipolar spindle, resulting in a lethal multipolar cell division. To survive, cells must cluster centrosomes into two poles to allow a bipolar cell division. Cancer cells are typically more proficient at centrosome clustering than untransformed cells, but the mechanism behind increased clustering ability is not well understood. Heterozygous missense mutations in PPP2R1A, which encodes the alpha isoform of the A-subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A-A), positively correlate with WGD. To understand this correlation, we introduced a heterozygous hotspot mutation, P179R, in endogenous PP2A-A in human tissue culture cells. We find that PP2A-AP179R decreases PP2A assembly and targeting. Strikingly, when centrosome number is increased, either through cytokinesis failure or centrosome amplification, PP2A-A mutant cells are more proficient than WT cells at centrosome clustering, likely due to PP2A-A loss-of-function. PP2A-AP179R appears to enhance centrosome clustering by altering the interactions between centrosomes and the cell cortex. Thus, cancer-associated mutations in PP2A-A may increase cellular fitness after WGD by enhancing centrosome clustering.",

    "abstract": "Sex specific traits are involved in speciation but it is difficult to determine whether their variation initiates or reinforces sexual isolation. In some insects, speciation depends of the rapid change of expression in desaturase genes coding for sex pheromones. Two closely related desaturase genes are involved in Drosophila melanogaster pheromonal communication: desat1 affects both the production and the reception of sex pheromones while desat2 is involved in their production in flies of Zimbabwe populations. There is a strong asymmetric sexual isolation between Zimbabwe populations and all other \\\"Cosmopolitan\\\" populations: Zimbabwe females rarely copulate with Cosmopolitan males whereas Zimbabwe males readily copulate with all females. All populations express desat1 but only Zimbabwe strains show high desat2 expression. To evaluate the impact of sex pheromones, female receptivity and desat expression on the incipient speciation process between Zimbabwe and Cosmopolitan populations, we introgressed the Zimbabwe genome into a Cosmopolitan genome labelled with the white mutation, using a multi-generation procedure. The association between these sex-specific traits was determined during the procedure. The production of pheromones was largely dissociated between the sexes. The copulation frequency (but not latency) was highly correlated with the female--but not with the male--principal pheromones. We finally obtained two stable white lines showing Zimbabwe-like sex pheromones, copulation discrimination and desat expression. Our study indicates that the variation of sex pheromones and of mating discrimination depend of distinct--yet overlapping--sets of genes in each sex suggesting that their cumulated effects participate to reinforce the speciation process.",

EV composition is complex and includes proteins, glycans, pigments, and RNA. RNA classes with putative roles in pathogenesis have been described in EVs produced by fungi. Here we describe the RNA content in EVs produced by the G186AR and G217B strains of Histoplasma capsulatum, an important human fungal pathogen. A total of 124 mRNA were identified in both strains. In this set of RNA classes, 93 transcripts were enriched in EVs from the G217B strain, while 31 enriched in EVs produced by the G186AR strain. This result suggests that there are important strain-specific properties in the mRNA composition of fungal EVs. We also identified short fragments (25-40 long) that were strain-specific, with a greater number of them identified in EVs produced by the G217B strain. Remarkably, the most enriched processes were stress responses and translation. Half of these fragments aligned to the reverse strand of the transcript, suggesting the occurrence of miRNA-like molecules in fungal EVs. We also compared the transcriptome profiles of H. capsulatum with the RNA composition of EVs and no correlation was observed. Altogether, our study provided information about the RNA molecules present in H. capsulatum EVs, and the differences in composition between the G186AR and G217B strains. In addition, we showed that the correlation between the most expressed transcripts in the cell and their presence in the EVs, reinforcing the idea that the RNAs were directed to the EVs by a regulated mechanism.\\n\\nImportanceExtracellular vesicles (EVs) play important roles in cellular communication and pathogenesis. The RNA molecules in EVs have been implicated in a variety of processes. In pathogenic fungi, EV-associated RNA classes have recently been described; however, only a few studies describing the RNA in fungal EVs are available. An improved knowledge on EV-associated RNA will contribute to the understanding of their role during infection. In this study, we described the RNA content in EVs produced by two isolates of Histoplasma capsulatum. Our results add this important pathogen to the current short list of fungal species with the ability to use EVs for the extracellular release of RNA.",

    "abstract": "Continual learning remains to be an unsolved problem in artificial neural networks. Biological systems have evolved mechanisms by which they can prevent catastrophic forgetting of old knowledge during new training and allow lifelong learning. Building upon data suggesting the importance of sleep in learning and memory, here we test a hypothesis that sleep protects memories from catastrophic forgetting. We found that training in a thalamocortical network model of a \\\"new\\\" memory that interferes with previously stored \\\"old\\\" memory may result in degradation and forgetting of the old memory trace. Simulating NREM sleep immediately after new learning leads to replay, which reverses the damage and ultimately enhances both old and new memory traces. Surprisingly, we found that sleep replay goes beyond recovering old memory traces that were damaged by new learning. When a new memory competes for the neuronal/synaptic resources previously allocated to the old memory, sleep replay changes the synaptic footprint of the old memory trace to allow for the overlapping populations of neurons to store multiple memories. Different neurons become preferentially supporting different memory traces to allow successful recall. We compared synaptic weight dynamics during sleep replay with that during interleaved training - a common approach to overcome catastrophic forgetting in artificial networks - and found that interleaved training promotes synaptic competition and weakening of reciprocal synapses, effectively reducing an ensemble of neurons contributing to memory recall. This leads to suboptimal recall performance compared to that after sleep. Together, our results suggest that sleep provides a powerful mechanism to achieve continual learning by combining consolidation of new memory traces with reconsolidation of old memory traces to minimize memory interference.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in experimental biology have generated huge amount of data. Due to differences present in detection targets and detection mechanisms, the produced data comes with different formats and lengths. There is an urgent call for computational methods to integrate these diverse data. Deep learning model is an ideal tool to cope with complex datasets, but its inherent  black box nature needs more interpretability. Here, we present MultiCapsNet, a deep learning model built on CapsNet and scCapsNet. The MultiCapsNet model possesses the merits of both easier data integration and higher model interpretability. In the first example, we use the labeled variant call dataset, which is originally used to test the models for automating somatic variant refinement. We divide the 71 features listed in the dataset into eight groups according to data source and data property. Then, the data from those eight groups with different formats and lengths are integrated by our MultiCapsNet to predict the labels associated with each variant call. The performance of our MultiCapsNet matches the previous deep learning model well, given much less parameters than those needed by the previous model. After training, the MultiCapsNet model provides importance scores for each data source directly, while the previous deep learning model needs an extra importance determination step to do so. Despite that our MultiCapsNet model is substantially different from the previous deep learning model and the source importance measuring methods are also different, the importance score correlation between these two models is very high. In the second example, the prior knowledge, including information for protein-protein interactions and protein-DNA interactions, is used to determine the structure of MultiCapsNet model. The single cell RNA sequence data are decoupled into multiple parts according to the structure of MultiCapsNet model that has been integrated with prior knowledge, with each part represents genes influenced by a transcription factor or involved in a protein-protein interaction network and then could be viewed as a data source. The MultiCapsNet model could classify cells with high accuracy as well as reveal the contribution of each data source for cell type recognition. The high ranked contributors are often relevant to the contributed cell type.",

    "abstract": "Septins are conserved GTP-binding cytoskeletal proteins that polymerize into filaments by end-to-end joining of heterooligomeric complexes. In human cells, both hexamers and octamers exist, and crystallography studies predicted the order of the hexamers to be SEPT7-SEPT6-SEPT2-SEPT2-SEPT6-SEPT7, while octamers are thought to have the same core, but with SEPT9 at the ends. However, based on this septin organization, octamers and hexamers would not be expected to co-polymerize due to incompatible ends. Here we isolated hexamers and octamers of specific composition from human cells and show that hexamers and octamers polymerize individually and, surprisingly, with each other. Binding of Borg3 results in distinctive clustering of each filament type. Moreover, we show that the organization of hexameric and octameric complexes is inverted compared to its original prediction. This revised septin organization is congruent with the organization and behavior of yeast septins suggesting that their properties are more conserved than was previously thought.",

    "abstract": "The midbody is an organelle assembled at the intercellular bridge that connects the two daughter cells at the end of mitosis. It is composed of a multitude of proteins, organized in a precise and stereotyped pattern, that control the final separation of the daughter cells and prevent incorrect genome segregation. Furthermore, recent evidence indicates that the midbody is involved in many other important processes, including cell fate, pluripotency, apical-basal polarity, tissue organization, and cilium and lumen formation. Understanding the regulation and interactions of midbody proteins is therefore essential to unravel how this organelle executes its multiple functions. Here, we report the first experimentally-based characterization of the intricate midbody protein-protein interaction network (interactome), which identifies a plethora of novel interactions and provides an extremely valuable resource for dissecting the multiple roles of the midbody. Initial analysis of this interactome already revealed that PP1{beta}-MYPT1 phosphatase regulates microtubule dynamics in late cytokinesis and de-phosphorylates the kinesin component MKLP1/KIF23 of the centralspindlin complex, a key cytokinesis regulator. This de-phosphorylation antagonizes Aurora B kinase in order to modify the functions of centralspindlin and its interactions in late cytokinesis. Our findings expand the repertoire of PP1 functions during mitosis and indicate that spatiotemporal changes in the distribution of kinases and counteracting phosphatases finely tune the activity of cytokinesis proteins.",

Several of the 13 known mammalian septins assemble into nonpolar, multimeric complexes that can further polymerize into filamentous structures. While some GFP-coupled septins have been described, overexpression of GFP-tagged septins often leads to artifacts in localization and function. To overcome this ubiquitous problem, we have here generated a genome-edited rat fibroblast cell line expressing Septin 2 (Sept2) coupled to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) from both chromosomal loci.\\n\\nWe characterize these cells by genomic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for genomic integration, by western blot and reverse transcriptase-PCR for expression, by immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation for the colocalization of septins with one another and cellular structures and for complex formation of different septins. By live cell imaging, proliferation and migration assays we investigate proper function of septins in these cells.\\n\\nWe find that EGFP is incorporated into both chromosomal loci and only EGFP-coupled Sept2 is expressed in homozygous cells. We find that endogenous Sept2-EGFP exhibits expression levels, localization and incorporation into cellular septin complexes similar to the wt in these cells. The expression level of other septins is not perturbed and cell division and cell migration proceed normally.

Stratifying by bipolar subtypes could elucidate the nature of this association and inform research on sleep and BD. We therefore aimed to determine whether polygenic risk scores (PRS) for insomnia, daytime sleepiness and sleep duration differ according to bipolar subtypes (bipolar I disorder, BD-I or bipolar II disorder, BD-II).\\n\\nMethodsIn this case-control study, we used multinomial regression to determine whether PRS for insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and sleep duration were associated with risk of BD-I or BD-II when compared to each other and to controls. Cases (n=4672) were recruited within the United Kingdom from the Bipolar Disorder Research Network. Controls (n=5714) were recruited from the 1958 British Birth Cohort and UK Blood Service. All participants were of European ancestry. Clinical subtypes of BD were determined by semi-structured psychiatric interview (the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry) and case notes.\\n\\nResultsWithin cases, 3404 and 1268 met DSM-IV criteria for BD-I and BD-II, respectively. Insomnia PRS was associated with increased risk of BD-II (RR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.07-1.21, P = 8.26 x 10-5) but not BD-I (RR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.94-1.03, P = .409) relative to controls. In contrast, sleep duration PRS was associated with increased relative risk of BD-I (RR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.06-1.15, P = 1.13 x 10-5), but not BD-II (RR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.93-1.06, P = .818). Daytime sleepiness PRS was associated with an increased risk of BD-I (RR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.02-1.11, P = .005) and BD-II (RR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.07-1.22, P = 3.22 x 10-5) compared to controls, but did not distinguish subtypes from each other.\\n\\nConclusionsBipolar subtypes differ in genetic liability to insomnia and sleep duration.

Besides, direct causal associations between farms management and reproductive infections (Chlamydia abortus, Coxiella burnetii, and Neospora caninum), reproductive disorders and infections were also investigated in this study. As a secondary objective, constraints that affect the production in cattle farms were examined. The study was carried out in the north-western (Una-Sana), western (Canton 10) and central part (Central Bosnia Canton) of Bosnia and Herzegovina. A total of 201 farms were selected for participation. A semi-structured questionnaire-based interview was conducted among farmers/managers from January 1st to August 31st, 2015. The 40 questions were divided into three groups: socio-demographic, management, and information on reproductive performances in cattle. Supplementary questions were asked about the perceived primary constraints of the production.\\n\\nA multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression was used to screen management factors for potential statistical influence. All investigated outcomes were associated with farms management. The final multivariable models were merged into a Structural Equation Model (SEM). The causal model was then specified graphically. The SEM model showed that herds that experienced abortions (OR=4.3) and stillbirth (OR=6.7) were associated with N. caninum seropositivity. Also, herds that experienced retention of placenta were strongly associated with the occurrence of metritis (OR=10.1). C. abortus and C. burnetii herd seropositivities were mainly associated with environmental factors and contact with potential intermediate hosts.\\n\\nOur study demonstrated that management practices on dairy farms in Bosnia and Herzegovina contributed to the occurrence of severe reproductive outcomes and reproductive infections. N. caninum seems to be an infectious agent that substantially contributed to the reproductive underperformance.

    "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) are potent regulators of gene expression that function in diverse developmental and physiological processes. Argonaute proteins loaded with miRNAs form the miRNA Induced Silencing Complexes (miRISCs) that repress gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. miRISCs target genes through partial sequence complementarity between the miRNA and the target mRNAs 3 UTR. In addition to being targeted by miRNAs, these mRNAs are also extensively regulated by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) through RNA processing, transport, stability, and translation regulation. While the degree to which RBPs and miRISCs functionally interact to regulate gene expression is likely extensive, we have only begun to unravel these functional interactions. An RNAi-based screen of putative ALG-1 Argonaute interactors has identified a role for a conserved RNA binding protein, HRPK-1, in modulating miRNA activity during C. elegans development. Here, we report the physical and genetic interaction between HRPK-1 and ALG-1/miRNAs. Specifically, we report the genetic and molecular characterizations of hrpk-1 and its role in C. elegans development and miRNA-mediated target repression. We show that loss of hrpk-1 causes numerous developmental defects and enhances the mutant phenotypes associated with reduction of miRNA activity, including those of lsy-6, mir-35-family, and let-7-family miRNAs. In addition to hrpk-1 genetic interaction with these miRNA families, hrpk-1 is required for efficient regulation of lsy-6 target cog-1. We report that hrpk-1 may play a role in miRNA processing but is not globally required for mature miRNA biogenesis or ALG-1/AIN-1 miRISC assembly and confirm HRPK-1 ability to co-precipitate with ALG-1. We suggest that HRPK-1 may functionally interact with miRNAs on multiple levels to enhance miRNA/miRISC gene regulatory activity and present several models for its activity.\\n\\nAuthor summarymicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. The core microRNA Induced Silencing Complex (miRISC), composed of Argonaute, mature microRNA, and GW182 protein effector, assembles on the target messenger RNA and inhibits translation or leads to messenger RNA degradation. RNA binding proteins interface with miRNA pathways on multiple levels to coordinate gene expression regulation. Here, we report identification and characterization of HRPK-1, a conserved RNA binding protein, as a physical and functional interactor of miRNAs. We confirm the physical interaction between HRPK-1, an hnRNPK homolog, and Argonaute ALG-1. We report characterizations of hrpk-1 role in development and its functional interactions with multiple miRNA families. We suggest that HRPK-1 promotes miRNA activity on multiple levels in part by contributing to miRNA processing and by coordinating with miRISC at the level of target RNAs.

    "abstract": "The current physical goods economy produces materials by extracting finite valuable resources without taking their end of the life and environmental impact into account. Modernity leaves us with devasted landscapes of depleted resources, waste landfill, queries, oil platforms. At the time of the Anthropocene, the various effects the human role has on the constitution of the soils create an acceleration of material entropy. It is the terrestrial entanglement of fungal materials that we investigate in this paper by offering an alternative fabrication paradigm based on the growth of resources rather than on extraction. Unlike the latter, biologically augmented building materials can be grown by combining micro-organisms such as fungal mycelium with agricultural plant-based waste. In this study, we investigate the production process, the mechanical, hygrothermal and chemical properties of mycelium-based composites with different types of lignocellulosic reinforcement fibres combined with a white rot fungus, Trametes versicolor. Together, they form an interwoven three-dimensional filamentous network binding the feedstock into a lightweight material. The mycelium-based material is heat-killed after the growing process. This is the first study reporting the dry density, the Youngs modulus, the compressive stiffness, the stress-strain curves, the thermal conductivity, the water absorption rate and a complete FTIR analyse of mycelium-based composites by making use of a disclosed protocol with T. versicolor and five different type of fibres (hemp, flax, flax waste, softwood, straw) and fibre conditions (loose, chopped, dust, pre-compressed and tow). These experimental results show that mycelium-composites can fulfil the requirements of thermal insulation. The thermal conductivity and water absorption coefficient of the mycelium composites with flax, hemp, and straw have an overall good insulation behaviour in all the aspects compared to conventional unsustainable materials. The conducted tests reveal that the mechanical performances of the mycelium-based composites depend more on the fibre condition, size, and processing than on the chemical composition of the fibres.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=78 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/569749_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (40K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1306289org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@195161corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@de9355org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9aea50_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical abstract\\n\\nC_FIG HighlightsO_LIThe type of fibre influences the colonisation of mycelium: samples containing flax, hemp, straw and flax-waste resulted in a well-developed composite\\nC_LIO_LIThe type of fibre has a smaller influence on the compressive stiffness than the fibre processing and size.\\nC_LIO_LIPre-compression and chopped fibres (particle size <5mm) improve the compressive mechanical properties of mycelium composites.\\nC_LIO_LIThe thermal conductivity and water absorption coefficient of the mycelium composites with flax, hemp, and straw have an overall good insulation behaviour in all the aspects compared to conventional unsustainable materials.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Nutrients are utilized and re-constructed by endodermal epithelial cells (EECs) in yolk sac membranes in avian species. Sterol-O acyltransferase 1 (SOAT1) is the key enzyme to convert cholesterol to cholesteryl ester for delivery to growing embryos. During development, absorption of yolk is matched with significant changes of SOAT1 mRNA and enzyme activity. miRNAs regulate angiogenesis and metabolism during mammalian development. However, the involvement of miRNAs in lipid utilization during avian embryogenesis remains ambiguous.\\n\\nUsing a miRNA sequencing technique, we found several candidate miRNAs and confirmed expression patterns with real time PCR. They were selected for as candidates targeting the receptor (TGF{beta} receptor type 1, TGFBR1) that may regulate SOAT1. Similar to SOAT1 mRNA accumulation, the gga-miR-181a-5p expression was gradually elevated during development, but the concentration of gga-miR-429-3p was in the opposite direction. Transfection with gga-miR-181a-5p or gga-miR-429-3p inhibited TGFBR1 and SOAT1 in EECs. The 3 untranslated region (3UTR) of TGFBR1 was then confirmed to be one of the targets of gga-miR-181a-5p and gga-miR-429-3p. Taken together, expression of miRNAs during embryonic development regulates SOAT1 expression by inhibiting the 3UTR of TGFBR1. This is indicative of possible regulation of avian yolk lipid utilization and modification of hatchability by changing miRNA expressions.",

    "abstract": "Evaluation of brainstem pathways with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography may provide insights into pathophysiologies associated with dysfunction of key brainstem circuits. However, identification of these tracts has been elusive, with relatively few in vivo human studies to date. In this paper we proposed an automated approach for reconstructing nine brainstem fiber trajectories of pathways that might be involved in pain modulation. We first performed native-space manual tractography of these fibers in a small normative cohort of participants and confirmed the anatomical precision of the results using existing anatomical literature. Second, region-of-interest pairs were manually defined at each extracted fibers termini and nonlinearly warped to a standard anatomical brain template to create an atlas of the region-of-interest pairs. The resulting atlas was then transformed non-linearly into the native space of 17 veteran patients brains for automated brainstem tractography. Lastly, we assessed the relationships between the integrity levels of the obtained fiber bundles and pain severity levels. Fractional anisotropy (FA) measures derived using automated tractography reflected the respective tracts FA levels obtained via manual tractography. A significant inverse relationship between FA and pain levels was detected within the automatically derived dorsal and medial longitudinal fasciculi of the brainstem. This study demonstrates the utility of DTI in exploring brainstem circuitries involved in pain processing. In this context, the described automated approach is a viable alternative to the time-consuming manual tractography. The physiological and functional relevance of the measures derived from automated tractography is evidenced by their relationships with individual pain severities.",

    "abstract": "ABA is an important messenger that acts as the signaling mediator for regulating the adaptive response of plants to drought stress. Two production pathways, de novo biosynthesis and hydrolysis of glucose-conjugated ABA by {beta}-glucosidase (BG), increase cellular ABA levels in plants. ABA catabolism via hydroxylation by 8-hydroxylase (CYP707A), or conjugation by uridine diphosphate glucosyltransferase (UGT), decreases cellular ABA levels. The transport of ABA through ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-containing transporter proteins, members of ABC transporter G family (ABCG), across plasma membrane (PM) is another important pathway to regulate cellular ABA levels. In this study, based on our previously constructed transcriptome of peanut leaves in response to drought stress, fourteen candidate genes involved in ABA production (including AhZEP, AhNCED1 and AhNCED3, AhABA2, AhAAO1 and AhAAO2, AhABA3, AhBG11 and AhBG24), catabolism (including AhCYP707A3, AhUGT71K1 and AhUGT73B4) and transport (including AhABCG22-1 and AhABCG22-2), were identified homologously and phylogenetically, and further analyzed at the transcriptional level by real-time RT-PCR, simultaneously determining ABA levels in peanut leaves in response to drought. The high sequence identity and very similar subcellular localization of the proteins deduced from 14 identified genes involved in ABA production, catabolism and transport with the reported corresponding enzymes in databases suggest their similar roles in regulating cellular ABA levels. In response to drought stress, ABA accumulation levels in peanut leaves agree very well with the up-regulated expressions of ABA-producing genes (AhZEP, AhNCED1, AhAAO2, AhABA3, AhBG11 and AhBG24) and PM-localized ABA importer genes (AhABCG22-1 and AhABCG22-2), although the expression of ABA catabolic genes (AhCYP707A3 and AhUGT71K1) was also up-regulated. It is likely that drought-responsive induction of catabolic genes helps not only to maintain ABA levels within a permissible range, but also to prepare the plant for degradation of ABA after removal of the stress. These results suggest that ABA homeostasis in peanut leaves in response to drought may be coordinated by a master regulatory circuit that involves production, catabolism, and as well as transport.",

The risk ratio and atherogenic index were significantly lower in either APJ or EPJ supplemented group. Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) which remains associated with HDL showed significant increase in the activity in mice supplemented with PJ compared to mice with atherogenic diet (AD). PJ consumption significantly reduced lipid peroxidation and increased glutathione levels. The reduction in lipid peroxidation varied from 57 to 76%. PJ supplementation reduced peritoneal macrophages (MPM) mediated oxidation of LDL by 68 to 82% and decreased mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPM) Ox-LDL uptake by 31 to 48%. A significant up regulation of macrophage PON2 activity was induced by PJ reducing the macrophage oxidative stress.

    "abstract": "Fast amoeboid migration in the invasive fronts of melanoma is controlled by high levels of actomyosin contractility, which underlie its highly metastatic potential. How this migratory behaviour is coupled to other cytoskeletal components is poorly understood. Septins are increasingly recognized as novel cytoskeletal components, but details on their regulation and contribution to cancer migration and metastasis are lacking. Here, we show that the septin regulator Cdc42EP5 is consistently required for melanoma cells to migrate and invade into collagen-rich matrices, and to locally invade and disseminate in vivo. Cdc42EP5 associates with actin structures leading to increased actomyosin contractility and amoeboid migration. Cdc42EP5 effects these functions through SEPT9-dependent F-actin crosslinking, which enables the generation of F-actin bundles required for the sustained stabilisation of highly contractile actomyosin structures. This study provides evidence for Cdc42EP5 as a regulator of cancer cell motility that coordinates actin and septin networks. It also describes a unique role for SEPT9 in invasion and metastasis, and illustrates a mechanism that regulates its function in melanoma.",

Less explored are the genetic associations between Foxp3 allelic variants and tumor incidence, only sporadically reported in human studies. In this work, we tested and demonstrate that Foxp3fGFP, an allele classified as hypomorphic in Th1 inflammatory contexts but not affecting health at steady state, confers increased anti-tumor immunity. Our conclusions stem out of the analysis of three tumor models of different tissue origin, in two murine genetic backgrounds. When compared to wild type animals, mice carrying the Foxp3fGFP allele spontaneously delay, reduce or prevent primary tumor growth, decrease metastasis growth and potentiate the response to anti-CTLA4 monotherapy. These findings suggest that allelic variance at the Foxp3 locus may have significant impact on cancer incidence and/or the success of cancer-immunotherapies in humans.",

Here, we employ long-term, rapid lightsheet and two-photon imaging of Zebrafish retinas in vivo during early development to uncover the physical processes that govern the behavior of nuclei during IKNM. These images allow the capture of reliable tracks of nuclear movements and division during early retinogenesis for many tightly packed nuclei. These tracks are then used to create and test a theory of retinal IKNM as a diffusive process across a nuclear concentration gradient generated by the addition of new nuclei at the apical surface. The analysis reveals the role of nuclear packing at the apical surface on the migration dynamics of nuclei, provides a robust quantitative explanation for the distribution of nuclei across the retina, and may have implications for stochastic fate choice in this system.",

Field trials were performed to determine the effects of cassava/peanut intercropping on rhizospheric soil nutrient content, enzyme activities, microbial quantity and microbial community structure. The microbial community was characterized by 16S rRNA tag-based high-throughput sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Results showed that cassava/peanut intercropping could improve the physicochemical properties of rhizospheric soil by increasing the available nutrient content, pH, bacterial quantity, and some enzyme activities and by altering the microbial community structure. 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated that the microbial community structure varied between the intercropping and monoculture systems. Nitrospirae, Verrucomicrobia and Gemmatimonadetes were more abundant in the intercropping system than in the monocultures. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that the abundances of DA101, Pilimelia and Ramlibacter were positively correlated with environmental parameters such as available nitrogen and pH, and these were dominant genera in the rhizospheric soil of the intercropped peanut plants.",

Here we describe ACT-seq, a novel and streamlined method for mapping genome-wide distributions of histone tail modifications, histone variants, and chromatin-binding proteins in a small number of or single cells. ACT-seq utilizes a fusion of Tn5 transposase to Protein A that is targeted to chromatin by a specific antibody, allowing chromatin fragmentation and sequence tag insertion specifically at genomic sites presenting the relevant antigen. The Tn5 transposase enables the use of an index multiplexing strategy (iACT-seq), which enables construction of thousands of single-cell libraries in one day by a single researcher without the need for drop-based fluidics or visual sorting. We conclude that ACT-seq present an attractive alternative to existing techniques for mapping epigenetic marks in single cells.",

Steinernema carpocapsae is one of the most studied entomopathogens due to its broad lethality to diverse insect species and its effective commercial use as a biological control agent for insect pests, as well as a genetic model for studying parasitism, pathogenesis, and symbiosis. In this study, we used long-reads from the Pacific Biosciences platform and BioNano Genomics Irys system to assemble the best genome of S. carpocapsae ALL strain to date, comprising 84.5 Mb in 16 scaffolds, with an N50 of 7.36Mb. The largest scaffold, with 20.9Mb, was identified as chromosome X based on sex-specific genome sequencing. The high level of contiguity allowed us to characterize gene density, repeat content, and GC content. RNA-seq data from 17 developmental stages, spanning from embryo to adult, were used to predict 30,957 gene models. Using this new genome, we performed a macrosyntenic analysis to Caenorhabditis elegans and Pristionchus pacificus and found S. carpocapsaes chromosome X to be primarily orthologous to C. elegans and P. pacificus chromosome II and IV. We also investigated the expansion of protein families and gene expression differences between male and female stage nematodes. This new genome and more accurate set of annotations provide a foundation for new comparative genomic and gene expression studies within the Steinernema clade and across the Nematoda phylum.\\n\\nArticle SummaryThe insect killing worms Steinernema carpocapsae is a model organism for parasitism and symbiosis. The authors have used long reads and optical mapping to generate substantially contiguous assembly and a new set of gene annotations. They have identified the X chromosome as well as expansions in specific family proteases found in the venom of this worm. A macrosyntenic analysis with C. elegans shows a broad conservation of ancestral chromosomes with the exception of chromosome X. This new assembly will be useful to the Steinernema community and the broader nematode genomics community.",

    "abstract": "The genetic determinants of bacterial pathogenicity are highly variable between species and strains. However, a factor that is commonly associated with virulent Gram-negative bacteria, including many Aeromonas spp., is the type 3 secretion system (T3SS), which is used to inject effector proteins into target eukaryotic cells. In this study, we developed a bioinformatics pipeline to identify T3SS effector proteins, applied this approach to the genomes of 105 Aeromonas strains isolated from environmental, mutualistic, or pathogenic contexts and evaluated the cytotoxicity of the identified effectors through their heterologous expression in yeast. The developed pipeline uses a two-step approach, where candidate families are initially selected using HMM profiles with minimal similarity scores against the Virulence Factors DataBase (VFDB), followed by strict comparisons against positive and negative control datasets, greatly reducing the number of false positives. Using our approach, we identified 21 Aeromonas T3SS likely effector groups, of which 8 represented known or characterized effectors, while the remaining 13 had not previously been described in Aeromonas. We experimentally validated our in silico findings by assessing the cytotoxicity of representative effectors in Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741, with 15 out of 21 assayed proteins eliciting a cytotoxic effect in yeast. The results of this study demonstrate the utility of our approach, combining a novel in silico search method with in vivo experimental validation, and will be useful in future research aimed at identifying and authenticating bacterial effector proteins from other genera.",

    "abstract": "Soil microbial community and enzyme activities together affect various ecosystem functions of soils. Fertilization, as important agricultural management practices, are known to modify soil microbial characteristics; however, inconsistent results have been reported. The aim of this research therefore was to make a comparative study of the effects of different fertilization patterns (No N inputs (No N), 100% chemical fertilizer-N (CN) inputs (4/4CN) and different substitution rates of CN by organic manure-N (MN) (3/4CN+1/4MN, 2/4CN+2/4MN and 1/4CN+3/4MN)) on soil physicochemical properties, enzyme activities and microbial attributes in a GVP of Tianjin, China. Manure substitution of chemical fertilizer, especially at higher substitution rate (2/4CN+2/4MN and 1/4CN+3/4MN), improved soil physicochemical properties (higher soil organic C (SOC) and nutrient contents; lower bulk densities), promoted microbial growth (higher total phospholipid fatty acids and microbial biomass C contents) and activity (higher soil hydrolase activities). Manure addition caused a remarkable increase of the fungi/bacteria ratio and a distinct shift in the fungal (bacterial) community to greater abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (G+ bacteria) compared with saprotrophic fungi (G- bacteria). These changes drove shifts toward fungal-dominated soil microbial communities and then optimized microbial community structure. Also, manure application increased soil biodiversity (microbial community and enzyme function), indicated by increased Shannon-Wiener diversity. Redundancy analysis indicated that the most possible mechanism of the impacts of different fertilization patterns on soil microbial characteristics may be the mediation of SOC and nutrient (N) availability (especially SOC) in this GVP of China. In conclusion, manure substitution of chemical fertilizer, especially at higher substitution rate, was more efficient for improving soil quality and biological functions.",

    "abstract": "Cortical development is characterized by distinct spatial and temporal patterns of maturational changes across various cortical shape measures. There is a growing interest in summarizing complex developmental patterns into a single index, which can be used to characterize an individuals brain age. We conducted this study with two primary aims. First, we sought to quantify covariation patterns for a variety of cortical shape measures, including cortical thickness, gray matter volume, surface area, mean curvature, and travel depth, as well as white matter volume, and subcortical gray matter volume. We examined these measures in a sample of 869 participants aged 5-18 from the Healthy Brain Network (HBN) neurodevelopmental cohort using the Joint and Individual Variation Explained (Lock et al., 2013) method. We validated our results in an independent dataset from the Nathan Kline Institute - Rockland Sample (NKI-RS; N=210) and found remarkable consistency for some covariation patterns. Second, we assessed whether covariation patterns in the brain can be used to accurately predict a persons chronological age. Using ridge regression, we showed that covariation patterns can predict chronological age with high accuracy, reflected by our ability to cross-validate our model in an independent sample with a correlation coefficient of 0.84 between chronologic and predicted age. These covariation patterns also predicted sex with high accuracy (AUC=0.85), and explained a substantial portion of variation in full scale intelligence quotient (R2=0.10). In summary, we found significant covariation across different cortical shape measures and subcortical gray matter volumes. In addition, each shape measure exhibited distinct covariations that could not be accounted for by other shape measures. These covariation patterns accurately predicted chronological age, sex and general cognitive ability. In a subset of NKI-RS, test-retest (<1 month apart, N=120) and longitudinal scans (1.22 {+/-} 0.29 years apart, N=77) were available, allowing us to demonstrate high reliability for the prediction models obtained and the ability to detect subtle differences in the longitudinal scan interval among participants (median and median absolute deviation of absolute differences between predicted age difference and real age difference = 0.53 {+/-} 0.47 years, r=0.24, p-value=0.04).",

Despite its well documented implications for a wide diversity of behaviors, the molecular and cellular basis of habituation learning is not well understood. Using whole genome sequencing of zebrafish mutants isolated in an unbiased genetic screen, we identified the palmitoyltransferase Hip14 as a critical regulator of habituation learning. We demonstrate that Hip14 regulates depression of sensory inputs onto an identified neuron and provide compelling evidence that Hip14 palmitoylates the Shaker-like channel subunit Kv1.1, thereby regulating Kv1.1 subcellular localization. Furthermore, we show that loss of either Kv1.1 or Hip14 leads to habituation deficits, and that Hip14 is dispensable in development and instead acts acutely to promote habituation. Combined, our results uncover a previously unappreciated role for acute post-translational palmitoylation at defined circuit components to regulate learning.",

We introduce scSplit which utilises genetic differences inferred from scRNA-Seq data alone to demultiplex pooled samples. scSplit also extracts a minimal set of high confidence presence/absence genotypes in each cluster which can be used to map clusters to original samples. Using a range of simulated, merged individual-sample as well as pooled multi-individual scRNA-Seq datasets, we show that scSplit is highly accurate and concordant with demuxlet predictions. Furthermore, scSplit predictions are highly consistent with the known truth in cell-hashing dataset. We also show that multiplexed-scRNA-Seq can be used to reduce batch effects caused by technical biases. scSplit is ideally suited to samples for which external genome-wide genotype data cannot be obtained (for example non-model organisms), or for which it is impossible to obtain unmixed samples directly, such as mixtures of genetically distinct tumour cells, or mixed infections. scSplit is available at: https://github.com/jon-xu/scSplit",

Seven or seventeen weeks after the last GSPE dose, while animals were on cafeteria diet, we used RT-PCR to measure the mRNA of the key energy metabolism enzymes from liver, adipose depots and muscle. We found that a reduction in the expression of adipose Lpl might explain the lower amount of adipose tissue in rats seven weeks after the last GSPE dose. Liver showed increased expression of Cpt1a and Hmgs2 together with a reduction in Fasn and Dgat2. In addition, fatty oxidation (Oxct1 and Cpt1b mRNA) was increased in muscle. However, after seventeen weeks, there was a completely different gene expression pattern. As conclusion, seven weeks after the last GSPE administration there was a limitation in adipose accrual that might be mediated by an inhibition of the gene expression of the adipose tissue Lpl. Concomitantly there was an increase in fatty acid oxidation in liver and muscle.",

By contrast, individual patients with very short telomeres displayed long survival times after cancer manifestation. Mildly accelerated telomere attrition was found in older NBS heterozygotes.

Humanized Nbs mice (with much longer telo-meres than those in human beings) did not show accelerated telomere attrition.\\n\\nOur data clearly show that NBS is a secondary telomeropathy with unique features.

On the other hand, short telomeres may prevent an even worse pheno-type when a tumor has developed. These data may help to understand the high cancer rate in NBS and also the bifunctional role of telomere shortening in cancerogenesis.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryDNA damage is harmful because it leads to mutations in genes that initiate or accelerate cancerogenesis. The devastating consequences of DNA damage are manifested in diseases with non-functional repair pathways such as Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS). A common feature of these diseases is a high tumor incidence. However, cancer incidence varies and is not clear why it is highest for NBS. In a previous study, we have shown that the underlying nebrin mutation not only leads to defective DNA repair but also to higher degree of oxidative stress that generates further DNA lesions. Nibrin may play also an important role in protecting chromosome ends, the telomeres, from inap-propriate DNA repair. Therefore we examined the telomere length in NBS and show markedly reduced values in affected patients but not in NBC mice (with much milder phenotype and longer telomeres). Telomere attrition contributes to genetic instability and may thus contribute to the high cancer incidence in NBS. Individual patients with very short telomeres, however, displayed long survival times after cancer manifestation. Thus, short telomeres may also prevent an even worse phenotype when a tumor has developed. These data are fundamental to understanding the high cancer rate in NBS and also the bifunctional role of telomere shortening in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Landscape genomics integrates population genetics with landscape ecology, allowing the identification of putative molecular determinants involved in environmental adaptation across the natural geographic and ecological range of populations. Wild Phaseolus vulgaris, the progenitor of common bean (P. vulgaris), has a remarkably extended distribution over 10,000 km from northern Mexico to northwestern Argentina. Earlier research has shown that this distribution represents a range expansion from Mesoamerica to the southern Andes through several discrete migration events and that the species colonized areas with different temperature and rainfall compared to its core area of origin. Thus, this species provides an opportunity to examine to what extent adaptation of a species can be broadened or, conversely, ecological or geographical distribution can be limited by inherent adaptedness. In the current study, we applied a landscape genomics approach to a collection of 246 wild common bean accessions representative of its broad geographical and climatic distribution and genotyped for [~]20K SNPs. We applied two different but complementary approaches for identifying loci putatively involved in environmental adaptation: i) an outlier-detection method that identifies loci showing strong differentiation between sub-populations; ii) an association method based on the identification of loci associated with bio-climatic variables. This integrated approach allowed the identification of several genes showing signature of selection across the different natural sub-populations of this species, as well as genes associated with specific bio-climatic variables related to temperature and precipitation. The current study demonstrates the feasibility of landscape genomics approach for a preliminary identification of specific populations and novel candidate genes involved in environmental adaptation in P. vulgaris. As a resource for broadening the genetic diversity of the domesticated gene pool of this species, the genes identified constitute potential molecular markers and introgression targets for the breeding improvement of domesticated common bean.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe ancestral form of common bean has an unusually large distribution in the Americas, extending over 10,000 km from [~]35{degrees} N. Lat. to [~]35{degrees} S. Lat. This wide distribution results from discrete long-range dissemination events to the Andes region from the original environments in Mesoamerica. It also suggests adaptation to new environments that are distinct from those encountered in Mesoamerica. In this research, we identified genes that may be involved in adaptation to climate variables in these new environments using two methods. A first method - outlier detection - was used to identify genome regions that differentiated the wild bean groups in the Andes resulting from discrete dissemination events among themselves and the different groups in Mesoamerica. The second method - genome-wide association - was used to identify candidate genome regions correlated with these same variables across the entire distribution from Mesoamerica to the southern Andes. The two methods identified two sets of candidate genes, several of which were related to the water status of plants, and illustrate how the genetic architecture of adaptation following long-range dissemination. This study provides sets of candidate genes as well as candidate wild bean populations that need to be corroborated for their use in increasing the water use efficiency of domesticated beans.",

    "abstract": "Chapparvoviruses are a highly divergent group of parvoviruses (family Parvoviridae) first identified in 2013. Interest in these poorly characterized viruses has been raised by recent studies indicating that they are the cause of chronic kidney disease that arises spontaneously in laboratory mice. In this study, we investigate the biological and evolutionary characteristics of chapparvoviruses via comparative analysis of genome sequence data. Our analysis, which incorporates sequences derived from endogenous viral elements (EVEs) as well as exogenous viruses, reveals that chapparvoviruses are an ancient lineage within the family Parvoviridae, clustering separately from members of both currently established parvoviral subfamilies. Consistent with this, they exhibit a number of characteristic genomic and structural features, i.e. a large number of putative auxiliary protein-encoding genes, capsid protein genes non-homologous to any hitherto parvoviral cap, as well as a putative capsid structure lacking the canonical fifth strand of the ABIDG sheet comprising the luminal side of the jelly roll. Our findings demonstrate that the chapparvovirus lineage infects an exceptionally broad range of host species, including both vertebrates and invertebrates. Furthermore, we observe that chapparvoviruses found in fish are more closely related to those from invertebrates than they are to those that infect amniote vertebrates. This suggests that transmission between distantly related host species may have occurred in the past. Our study provides the first integrated overview of the chapparvovirus group, and revises current views of parvovirus evolution\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYChapparvoviruses are a recently identified group of viruses about which relatively little is known. However, recent studies have shown that these viruses cause disease in laboratory mice and are prevalent in the fecal virome of pigs and poultry, raising interest in their potential impact as pathogens, and utility as experimental tools. We examined the genomes of chapparvoviruses and endogenous viral elements ( fossilized virus sequences derived from ancestral viruses) using a variety of bioinformatics-based approaches. We show that the chapparvoviruses have an ancient origin and are evolutionarily distinct from all other related viruses. Accordingly, their genomes and virions exhibit a range of distinct characteristic features. We examine the distribution of these features in the light of chapparvovirus evolutionary history (which we can also infer from genomic data), revealing new insights into chapparvovirus biology.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous mutations are the source of new genetic variation and are thus central to the evolutionary process. In molecular evolution and quantitative genetics, the nature of genetic variation depends critically on the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of mutations. Spontaneous mutation accumulation (MA) experiments have been the principal approach for investigating the overall rate of occurrence and cumulative effect of mutations, but have not allowed the effects of individual mutations to be studied directly. Here, we crossed MA lines of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii with its unmutated ancestral strain to create haploid recombinant lines, each carrying an average of 50% of the accumulated mutations in a variety of combinations. With the aid of the genome sequences of the MA lines, we inferred the genotypes of the mutations, assayed their growth rate as a measure of fitness, and inferred the DFE using a novel Bayesian mixture model that allows the effects of individual mutations to be estimated. We infer that the DFE is highly leptokurtic (L-shaped), and that a high proportion of mutations increase fitness in the laboratory environment. The inferred distribution of effects for deleterious mutations is consistent with a strong role for nearly neutral evolution.

    "abstract": "PurposeA major challenge in genomic medicine is how to best predict risk of disease from rare variants discovered in Mendelian disease genes but with limited phenotypic data. We have recently used Bayesian methods to show that in vitro functional measurements and computational pathogenicity classification of variants in the cardiac gene SCN5A correlate with rare arrhythmia penetrance. We hypothesized that similar predictors could be used to impute variant-specific penetrance prior probabilities.\\n\\nMethodsFrom a review of 756 publications, we developed a pattern mixture algorithm, based on a Bayesian Beta-Binomial model, to generate SCN5A variant-specific penetrance priors for the heart arrhythmia Brugada syndrome (BrS).\\n\\nResultsThe resulting priors correlate with mean BrS penetrance posteriors (cross validated R2= 0.41). SCN5A variant function and structural context provide the most information predictive of BrS penetrance. The resulting priors are interpretable as equivalent to the observation of affected and unaffected carriers.\\n\\nConclusionsBayesian estimates of penetrance can efficiently integrate variant-specific data (e.g. functional, structural, and sequence) to accurately estimate disease risk attributable to individual variants. We suggest this formulation of penetrance is quantitative, probabilistic, and more precise than, but consistent with, discrete pathogenicity classification approaches.",

    "abstract": "Albinism is the most common color variation described in fish and is characterized by a white or yellow phenotype according to the species. In rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, aside from yellow-albino phenotypes, cobalt blue variants with autosomal, recessive inheritance have also been reported. In this study, we investigated the inheritance pattern and chromatophores distribution/abundance of cobalt blue trouts obtained from a local fish farm. Based on crosses with wild-type and dominant yellow-albino lines, we could infer that cobalt blue are dominant over wild-type and co-dominant in relation to yellow-albino phenotype, resulting in a fourth phenotype: the white-albino. Analysis of chromatophores revealed that cobalt blue trouts present melanophores, as the wild-type, and a reduced number of xanthophores. As regards to the white-albino phenotype, they were not only devoid of melanophores but also presented a reduced number of xanthophores. Cobalt blue and white-albino trouts also presented a more elongated body shape and, most remarkably, a smaller pituitary gland compared to wild-type and yellow-albino, suggesting that the allele for blue color is somehow linked with this abnormal pituitary phenotype. These phenotypes represent interesting models for research on body pigmentation in salmonids and on the mechanisms behind endocrine control of color patterning.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic defects derived from incorrect DNA repair during gametogenesis can lead to mutations, aneuploidies and infertility. Coordinated resolution of meiotic recombination intermediates is required for crossover formation, ultimately necessary for accurate completion of both rounds of chromosome segregation. Numerous master kinases orchestrate the correct assembly and activity of the repair machinery. Although much less is known, reversal of phosphorylation events in meiosis must also be key to coordinate the timing and functionality of repair enzymes. Cdc14 is an evolutionarily conserved phosphatase required for the dephosphorylation of multiple CDK1 targets. Mutations that inactivate this phosphatase lead to meiotic failure, but until now it was unknown if Cdc14 plays a direct role in meiotic recombination. Here, we show that elimination of Cdc14 leads to severe defects in the processing and resolution of recombination intermediates, causing a drastic depletion of crossovers when other repair pathways are compromised. We also show that Cdc14 is required for correct activity and localization of the Holliday Junction resolvase Yen1/GEN1. We reveal that Cdc14 regulates Yen1 activity from meiosis I onwards, and this function is essential for crossover resolution in the absence of other repair pathways. We also demonstrate that Cdc14 and Yen1 are required to safeguard sister chromatid segregation during the second meiotic division, a late action that is independent of the earlier role in crossover formation. Thus, this work uncovers previously undescribed functions of Cdc14 in the regulation of meiotic recombination.",

    "abstract": "Sister centromere fusion is a process unique to meiosis that promotes co-orientation of the sister kinetochores, ensuring they attach to microtubules from the same pole. We have found that the kinetochore protein SPC105R/KNL1 and Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1-87B) are required for this process. The analysis of these two proteins, however, has shown that two independent mechanisms maintain sister centromere fusion during meiosis I in Drosophila oocytes. Double depletion experiments demonstrated that the precocious separation of centromeres in Spc105R RNAi oocytes is Separase-dependent, suggesting cohesin proteins must be maintained at the core centromeres. In contrast, precocious sister centromere separation in Pp1-87B RNAi oocytes does not depend on Separase or Wapl. Further analysis with microtubule destabilizing drugs showed that PP1-87B maintains sister centromeres fusion by regulating microtubule dynamics. Additional double depletion experiments demonstrated that PP1-87B has this function by antagonizing Polo kinase and BubR1, two proteins known to promote kinetochore-microtubule (KT-MT) attachments. These results suggest that PP1-87B maintains sister centromere fusion by inhibiting stable KT-MT attachments. Surprisingly, we found that loss of C(3)G, the transverse element of the synaptonemal complex (SC), suppresses centromere separation in Pp1-87B RNAi oocytes. This is evidence for a functional role of centromeric SC in the meiotic divisions. We propose two mechanisms maintain co-orientation in Drosophila oocytes: one involves SPC105R to protect cohesins at sister centromeres and another involves PP1-87B to regulate spindle forces at end-on attachments.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMeiosis involves two cell divisions. In the first division, pairs of homologous chromosomes segregate, in the second division, the sister chromatids segregate. These patterns of division are mediated by regulating microtubule attachments to the kinetochores and stepwise release of cohesion between the sister chromatids. During meiosis I, cohesion fusing sister centromeres must be intact so they attach to microtubules from the same pole. At the same time, arm cohesion must be released for anaphase I. Upon entry into meiosis II, the sister centromeres must separate to allow attachment to opposite poles, while cohesion surrounding the centromeres must remain intact until anaphase II. How these different populations of cohesion are regulated is not understood. We identified two genes required for maintaining sister centromere cohesion, and surprisingly found they define two distinct mechanisms. The first is a kinetochore protein that maintains sister centromere fusion by recruiting proteins that protect cohesion. The second is a phosphatase that antagonizes proteins that stabilize microtubule attachments. We propose that entry into meiosis II coincides with stabilization of microtubule attachments, resulting in the separation of sister centromeres without disrupting cohesion in other regions, facilitating attachment of sister chromatids to opposite poles.",

    "abstract": "Different genomic sites evolve inter-dependently due to the combined action of epistasis, non-additive contributions of different loci to genome fitness, and physical linkage of different loci due to their common heritage. Both epistasis and linkage, partially compensated by recombination, cause correlations between allele frequencies at the loci (linkage disequilibrium, LD). The interaction and competition between epistasis and linkage are not fully understood, nor is their relative sensitivity to recombination. Modeling an adapting population in the presence of random mutation, natural selection, pairwise epistasis, and random genetic drift, we compare the contributions of epistasis and linkage. For this end, we use a panel of haplotype-based measures of LD and their various combinations calculated for epistatic and non-epistatic pairs separately. We compute the optimal percentages of detected and false positive pairs in a one-time sample of a population of moderate size. We demonstrate that true interacting pairs can be told apart in a sufficiently short genome within a narrow window of time and parameters. Outside of this parameter region, unless the population is extremely large, shared ancestry of individual sequences generates pervasive stochastic LD for non-interacting pairs masking true epistatic associations. In the presence of sufficiently strong recombination, linkage effects decrease faster than those of epistasis, and the detection of epistasis improves. We demonstrate that the epistasis component of locus association can be isolated, at a single time point, by averaging haplotype frequencies over multiple independent populations. These results demonstrate the existence of fundamental restrictions on the protocols for detecting true interactions in DNA sequence sets.",

Using a precise framework of highly conserved syntenic genes on hexaploid wheat chromosome 3DL and its progenitor 3L chromosome arm of diploid Aegilops tauschii, we show that 70% of these genes exhibited proportionally reduced gene expression, in which expression in the hexaploid context of the 3DL genes was approximately 40% of the levels observed in diploid Ae. tauschii.

Gene sequence and methylation differences accounted for only a few cases of differences in gene expression. In contrast, large scale patterns of reduced chromatin accessibility of genes in the hexaploid chromosome arm compared to its diploid progenitor were correlated with observed overall reduction in gene expression and differential gene expression.

    "abstract": "Leishmaniasis is a global health problem with an estimated report of 2 million new cases every year and more than 1 billion people at risk of contracting this disease in endemic areas. The innate immune system plays a central role in controlling L. major infection by initiating a signaling cascade that results in production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and recruitment of both innate and adaptive immune cells. Upon infection with L. major, CXCL1 is produced locally and plays an important role in the recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection. Herein, we report that L. major specifically targets murine CXCL1 for degradation. The degradation of CXCL1 is not dependent on host factors as L. major can directly degrade recombinant CXCL1 in a cell-free system. Using mass spectrometry, we discovered that the L. major protease cleaves at the C-terminal end of murine CXCL1. Finally, our data suggest that L. major metalloproteases are involved in the direct cleavage and degradation of CXCL1, and a synthetic peptide spanning the CXCL1 cleavage site can be used to inhibit L. major metalloprotease activity. In conclusion, our study has identified an immune evasion strategy employed by L. major to evade innate immune responses in mice, likely reservoirs in the endemic areas, and further highlights that targeting these L. major metalloproteases may be important in controlling infection within the reservoir population and transmittance of the disease.\\n\\nAuthors summaryOur study discovered a highly specific role for L. major metalloprotease in cleaving and degrading murine CXCL1. Indeed, L. major metalloprotease did not cleave murine CXCL2 or human CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL8. CXCL1 is a critical chemokine required for neutrophil recruitment to the site of infection; thus, we propose that this metalloprotease may have evolved to evade immune responses specifically in the murine host. We have further identified that the C-terminal end on CXCL1 is targeted for cleavage by the L. major metalloprotease. Finally, this cleavage site information was used to design peptides that are able to inhibit CXCL1 degradation by L. major. Our study highlights an immune evasion strategy utilized by L. major to establish infection within a murine host.",

    "abstract": "Fungal pathogenesis depends on accurate secretion and location of virulence factors which drive host colonization. Protein glycosylation is a common posttranslational modification of cell wall components and other secreted factors, typically required for correct protein localization, secretion and function. Thus, the absence of glycosylation is associated with animal and plant pathogen avirulence. While the relevance of protein glycosylation for pathogenesis has been well established, the main glycoproteins responsible for the loss of virulence observed in glycosylation-defective fungi have not been identified. Here, we devise a proteomics approach to identify such proteins and use it to demonstrate a role for the highly conserved protein disulfide isomerase Pdi1 in virulence. We show that efficient Pdi1 N-glycosylation, which promotes folding into the correct protein conformation, is required for full pathogenic development of the corn smut fungus Ustilago maydis. Remarkably, the observed virulence defects are reminiscent of those seen in glycosylation-defective cells suggesting that the N-glycosylation of Pdi1 is necessary for the full secretion of virulence factors. All these observations, together with the fact that Pdi1 protein and RNA expression levels rise upon virulence program induction, suggest that Pdi1 glycosylation is a crucial event for pathogenic development in U. maydis. Our results provide new insights into the role of glycosylation in fungal pathogenesis.\\n\\nAuthor summaryFungal pathogens require virulence factors to be properly secreted and localized to guarantee complete infection. In common with many proteins, virulence factors must be post-translationally modified by glycosylation for normal localization, secretion and function. This is especially important for virulence factors, which are mainly comprised of cell wall and secreted proteins. Aberrant glycosylation leads to a loss of virulence in both animal and plant pathogenic fungi. We have previously demonstrated that glycosylation is important for virulence of the corn smut fungus, Ustilago maydis. However, the glycoproteins involved and their specific roles in the infection process have not yet been reported. Here, we describe a proteomic assay designed to identify glycoproteins involved in plant infection. Using this method, we define the role of Pdi1 protein disulfide isomerase in virulence. Interestingly, abolishing Pdi1 N-glycosylation mimics {Delta}pdi1 defects observed during infection, suggesting that Pdi1 N-glycosylation is required for the secretion of virulence factors. We hypothesize that Pdi1 N-glycosylation is crucial for maintaining proper effector protein folding during the infection process, especially in the harsh conditions found inside the maize plant.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA robust circadian clock has been implicated in plant resilience, resource-use efficiency, competitive growth and yield. A huge number of physiological processes are under circadian control in plants including: responses to biotic and abiotic stresses; flowering time; plant metabolism; and mineral uptake. Understanding how the clock functions in crops such as Triticum aestivum (bread wheat) and Brassica napus (oilseed rape) therefore has great agricultural potential. Delayed fluorescence (DF) imaging has been shown to be applicable to a wide range of plant species and requires no genetic transformation. Although DF has been used to measure period length of both mutants and wild ecotypes of Arabidopsis, this assay has never been systematically optimised for crop plants. The physical size of both B. napus and T. aestivum led us to develop a representative sampling strategy which enables high-throughput imaging of these crops.\\n\\nResultsIn this study, we describe the plant-specific optimisation of DF imaging to obtain reliable circadian phenotypes with the robustness and reproducibility to detect diverging periods between cultivars of the same species. We find that the age of plant material, light regime and temperature conditions all significantly effect DF rhythms and describe the optimal conditions for measuring robust rhythms in each species. We also show that sections of leaf can be used to obtain period estimates with improved throughput for larger sample size experiments.\\n\\nConclusionsWe present an optimized protocol for high-throughput phenotyping of circadian period specific to two economically valuable crop plants. Application of this method revealed significant differences between the periods of several widely grown elite cultivars. This method also identified intriguing differential responses of circadian rhythms in T. aestivum compared to B. napus; specifically the dramatic change to rhythm robustness when plants were imaged under constant light versus constant darkness. This points towards diverging networks underling circadian control in these two species.",

    "abstract": "The microbial communities that inhabit the distal gut of humans and other mammals exhibit large inter-individual variation. While host genetics is a known factor that influences gut microbiota composition, the mechanisms underlying this variation remain largely unknown. Bile acids (BAs) are hormones that are produced by the host and chemically modified by gut bacteria. BAs serve as environmental cues and nutrients to microbes, but they can also have antibacterial effects. We hypothesized that host genetic variation in BA metabolism and homeostasis influence gut microbiota composition. To address this, we used the Diversity Outbred (DO) stock, a population of genetically distinct mice derived from eight founder strains. We characterized the fecal microbiota composition and plasma and cecal BA profiles from 400 DO mice maintained on a high-fat high-sucrose diet for [~]22 weeks. Using quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis, we identified several genomic regions associated with variations in both bacterial and BA profiles. Notably, we found overlapping QTL for Turicibacter sp. and plasma cholic acid, which mapped to a locus containing the gene for the ileal bile acid transporter, Slc10a2. Mediation analysis and subsequent follow-up validation experiments suggest that differences in Slc10a2 gene expression associated with the different strains influences levels of both traits and revealed novel interactions between Turicibacter and BAs. This work illustrates how systems genetics can be utilized to generate testable hypotheses and provide insight into host-microbe interactions.\\n\\nAuthor summaryInter-individual variation in the composition of the intestinal microbiota can in part be attributed to host genetics.

To address this, we profiled the fecal microbiota composition of 400 genetically distinct mice, for which genotypic data is available. We identified many loci of the mouse genome associated with changes in abundance of bacterial taxa. One of these loci is also associated with changes in the abundance of plasma bile acids--metabolites generated by the host that influence both microbiota composition and host physiology. Follow up validation experiments provide mechanistic insights linking host genetic differences, with changes in ileum gene expression, bile acid-bacteria interactions and bile acid homeostasis. Together, this work demonstrates how genetic approaches can be used to generate testable hypothesis to yield novel insight into how host genetics shape gut microbiota composition.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundUmbilical cord blood (UCB) is commonly used in epigenome-wide association studies of prenatal exposures. Accounting for cell type composition is critical in such studies as it reduces confounding due to the cell specificity of DNA methylation (DNAm). In the absence of cell sorting information, statistical methods can be applied to deconvolve heterogeneous cell mixtures. Among these methods, reference-based approaches leverage age appropriate cell-specific DNA-methylation profiles to estimate cellular composition. In UCB, four reference datasets comprising DNAm signatures profiled in purified cell populations have been published using the Illumina 450K and 850K EPIC arrays. These datasets are biologically and technically different, and currently there is no consensus on how to best apply them. Here, we systematically evaluate and compare these datasets and provide recommendations for reference-based UCB deconvolution.\\n\\nResultsWe first evaluated the four reference datasets to ascertain both the purity of the samples and the potential cell cross-contamination. We filtered samples and combined datasets to obtain a joint UCB reference. We selected deconvolution libraries using two different approaches: automatic selection using the top differentially methylated probes from the function pickCompProbes in minfi and a standardized library selected using the IDOL (Identifying Optimal Libraries) iterative algorithm. We compared the performance of each reference separately and in combination, using the two approaches for reference library selection, and validated the results in an independent cohort (Generation R Study, n=191) with matched FACS measured cell counts. Strict filtering and combination of the references significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of cell type estimates. Ultimately, the IDOL library outperformed the library from the automatic selection method implemented in pickCompProbes.\\n\\nConclusionThese results have important implications for epigenetic studies in UCB as implementing this method will optimally reduce confounding due to cellular heterogeneity. This work provides guidelines for future reference-based UCB deconvolution and establishes a framework for combining reference datasets in other tissues.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIdentifying implausible clinical observations (e.g., laboratory test and vital sign values) in Electronic Health Record (EHR) data using rule-based procedures is challenging. Anomaly/outlier detection methods can be applied as an alternative algorithmic approach to flagging such implausible values in EHRs.\\n\\nObjectiveThe primary objectives of this research were to develop and test an unsupervised clustering-based anomaly/outlier detection approach for detecting implausible observations in EHR data as an alternative algorithmic solution to the existing procedures.\\n\\nMethodsOur approach is built upon two underlying hypotheses that, (i) when there are large number of observations, implausible records should be sparse, and therefore (ii) if these data are clustered properly, clusters with sparse populations should represent implausible observations. To test these hypotheses, we applied an unsupervised clustering algorithm to EHR observation data on 50 laboratory tests. We tested different specifications of the clustering approach and computed confusion matrix indices against a set of silver-standard plausibility thresholds. We compared the results from the proposed approach with conventional anomaly detection (CAD) approachs, including standard deviation and Mahalanobis distance.\\n\\nResultsWe found that the clustering approach produced results with exceptional specificity and high sensitivity. Compared with the conventional anomaly detection approaches, our proposed clustering approach resulted in significantly smaller number of false positive cases.\\n\\nConclusionOur contributions include (i) a clustering approach for identifying implausible EHR observations, (ii) evidence that implausible observations are sparse in EHR laboratory test results, (iii) a parallel implementation of the clustering approach on i2b2 star schema, and (3) a set of silver-standard plausibility thresholds for 50 laboratory tests that can be used in other studies for validation. The proposed algorithmic solution can augment human decisions to improve data quality. Therefore, a workflow is needed to complement the algorithms job and initiate necessary actions that need to be taken in order to improve the quality of data.",

    "abstract": "To maintain body homeostasis, endocrine systems must detect and integrate a multitude of blood-borne peripheral signals. This is mediated by specialized permeable pores in the endothelial membrane, dubbed fenestrae. Plasmalemma vesicles-associated protein (Plvap) is located in the fenestral diaphragm and is thought play a role in the selective passage of proteins through the fenestrae. However, this suggested function has yet to be demonstrated directly. Here, we studied the development of fenestrated capillaries in a major neuroendocrine interface between the blood and brain, namely the hypophysis. Using a transgenic permeability biosensor to visualize the vascular excretion of a genetically tagged plasma protein (DBP-EGFP), we show that the developmental acquisition of vascular permeability is associated with differential expression of zebrafish plvap orthologs in the hypophysis versus brain. Ultrastructural analysis of the hypophyseal vasculature revealed that plvapb mutants display deficiencies in fenestral and stomatal diaphragms as well as increased density of fenestrae, but not of caveolae. Measurements of DBP-EGFP dynamics in live plvapb mutant larvae provided a direct proof that Plvap limits the rate of blood-borne protein passage through fenestrated endothelia. Overall, we present the regulatory role of Plvap in the development of blood-borne protein detection machinery in a major neuroendocrine interface between the brain and the general circulation.",

    "abstract": "Whole genome sequencing can provide essential public health information. However, it is now known that widely used short-read methods have the potential to miss some randomly-distributed segments of genomes. This can prevent phages, plasmids, and virulence factors from being detected or properly identified. Here, we compared assemblies of three complete STEC O26:H11 genomes from two different sequence types (ST21 and 29), each acquired using the MiSeq-Nextera XT, MinION nanopore-based sequencing, and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) sequencing. Each closed genome consisted of a single chromosome, approximately 5.7 Mb for CFSAN027343, 5.6 Mb for CFSAN027346, and 5.4 MB for CFSAN027350. However, short-read WGS using MiSeq-Nextera failed to identify some virulence genes in plasmids and on the chromosome, both of which were detected using the long-read platforms. Results from long-read MinION and PacBio allowed us to identify differences in plasmid content: a single 88 kb plasmid in CFSAN027343; a 157kb plasmid in CFSAN027350; and two plasmids in CFSAN027346 (one 95 Kb, one 72 Kb). These data enabled rapid characterization of the virulome, detection of antimicrobial genes, and composition/location of Stx phages. Taken together, positive correlations between the two long-read methods for determining plasmids, virulome, antimicrobial resistance genes, and phage composition support MinION sequencing as one accurate and economical option for closing STEC genomes and identifying specific virulence markers.",

    "abstract": "Head direction cells in the mammalian limbic system are thought to function as an allocentric neuronal compass. Although traditional views hold that the compass of ground-dwelling species is planar, we show that head-direction cells in the rodent thalamus, retrosplenial cortex and cingulum fiber bundle are tuned to conjunctive combinations of azimuth, pitch or roll, similarly to presubicular cells in flying bats. Pitch and roll orientation tuning is ubiquitous, anchored to gravity, and independent of visual landmarks. When head tilts, azimuth tuning is affixed to the head-horizontal plane, but also uses gravity to remain anchored to the terrestrial allocentric world. These findings suggest that gravity defines all three degrees of freedom of the allocentric orientation compass, and only the azimuth component can flexibly remap to local cues in different environments. Collectively, these results demonstrate that a three-dimensional, gravity-based, neural compass is likely a ubiquitous property of mammalian species, including ground-dwelling animals.",

    "abstract": "The link between the modulation of integrin activity and cellular mechanosensing of tissue rigidity, especially on different extracellular matrix ligands, remains poorly understood. Here, we find that primary mouse mammary gland stromal fibroblasts (MSFs) are able to spread efficiently on soft collagen-coated substrates, resembling the soft mammary gland tissue. In addition, MSFs generate high forces and display nuclear YAP at a low matrix stiffness, supported by mature focal adhesions, prominent actin stress fibers, and myosin phosphorylation.\n\nWe describe that loss of the cytosolic integrin inhibitor, SHARPIN, impedes MSF spreading specifically on soft type I collagen but not on fibronectin. Through quantitative experiments and computational modelling, we find that SHARPIN-deficient MSFs display faster force-induced unbinding of adhesions from collagen-coated beads. Faster unbinding, in turn, impairs force transmission in these cells, particularly, at the stiffness optimum observed for wild-type cells, and increases actin retrograde flow. Mechanistically, we link the impaired mechanotransduction of SHARPIN-deficient cells on collagen to reduced levels of the collagen-binding integrin 11{beta}1. Our results unveil a collagen-specific mechanosensing mechanism and suggest a key function for integrin activity regulation and integrin 11{beta}1 in MSF mechanotransduction.",
