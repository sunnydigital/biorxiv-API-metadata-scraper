    "abstract": "Core object recognition, the ability to rapidly recognize objects despite variations in their appearance, is largely solved through the feedforward processing of visual information. Deep neural networks are shown to achieve human-level performance in these tasks, and explain the primate brain representation. On the other hand, object recognition under more challenging conditions (i.e. beyond the core recognition problem) is less characterized. One such example is object recognition under occlusion. It is unclear to what extent feedforward and recurrent processes contribute in object recognition under occlusion. Furthermore, we do not know whether the conventional deep neural networks, such as AlexNet, which were shown to be successful in solving core object recognition, can perform similarly well in problems that go beyond the core recognition. Here, we characterize neural dynamics of object recognition under occlusion, using magnetoencephalography (MEG), while participants were presented with images of objects with various levels of occlusion. We provide evidence from multivariate analysis of MEG data, behavioral data, and computational modelling, demonstrating an essential role for recurrent processes in object recognition under occlusion. Furthermore, the computational model with local recurrent connections, used here, suggests a mechanistic explanation of how the human brain might be solving this problem.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn recent years, deep-learning-based computer vision algorithms have been able to achieve human-level performance in several object recognition tasks. This has also contributed in our understanding of how our brain may be solving these recognition tasks. However, object recognition under more challenging conditions, such as occlusion, is less characterized. Temporal dynamics of object recognition under occlusion is largely unknown in the human brain. Furthermore, we do not know if the previously successful deep-learning algorithms can similarly achieve human-level performance in these more challenging object recognition tasks. By linking brain data with behavior, and computational modeling, we characterized temporal dynamics of object recognition under occlusion, and proposed a computational mechanism that explains both behavioral and the neural data in humans. This provides a plausible mechanistic explanation for how our brain might be solving object recognition under more challenging conditions.",

    "abstract": "3D cell culture aims at reconciliating the simplicity of in vitro models with the human like properties encountered in vivo. Soft permeable hydrogels have emerged as user-friendly materials to grow cells in more physiological conditions. With the intent on turning these homogeneous substrates into biomimetic templates, we introduce a generic solution compatible with the most biologically relevant and often frail materials. Here we take control of the chemical environment driving generic radical reactions to craft common gels with patterned light. In a simple microreactor, we harness the well-known inhibition of radicals by oxygen to enable topographical photopolymerization. Strikingly, by sustaining an oxygen rich environment, we can also induce hydrogel photo-scission which turns out to be a powerful and generic subtractive manufacturing method. We finally introduce a flexible patterned functionalization protocol based on available photo-linkers. Using these common tools on the most popular hydrogels, we tailored soft templates where cells grow or self-organize into standardized structures. The platform we describe has the potential to set a standard in future 3D cell culture experiments.",

    "abstract": "Natural genetic variation can determine the outcome of an infection, and often reflects the co-evolutionary battle between hosts and pathogens. We previously found that a natural variant of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans from Hawaii (HW) has increased resistance against natural microsporidian pathogens in the Nematocida genus, when compared to the standard laboratory strain of N2. In particular, HW animals can clear infection, while N2 animals cannot. In addition, HW animals have lower levels of intracellular colonization of Nematocida compared to N2. Here we investigate how this natural variation in resistance relates to autophagy. We found that there is much better targeting of autophagy-related machinery to parasites under conditions where they are cleared. In particular, ubiquitin targeting to Nematocida cells correlates very well with their subsequent clearance in terms of timing, host strain and age, as well as Nematocida species. Furthermore, clearance correlates with targeting of the LGG-2/LC3 autophagy protein to parasite cells, with HW animals having much more efficient targeting of LGG-2 to parasite cells than N2 animals. Surprisingly, however, we found that lgg-2 is not required to clear infection. Instead we found that loss of lgg-2 leads to increased intracellular colonization in the HW background, although interestingly, it does not affect colonization in the N2 background. Altogether our results suggest that there is natural genetic variation in an lgg-2-dependent process that regulates intracellular levels of microsporidia at a very early stage of infection prior to clearance.",

However, for heterogeneous tissues, bulk RNA-Seq can only provide the average gene expression profile for all cells from the tissue, making the interpretation of the sequencing result challenging. Single-cell RNA-seq, on the other hand, generates transcriptomic profiles of individual cell and cell types, making it a powerful method to decode the heterogeneity in complex tissues.\n\nThe retina is a heterogeneous tissue composed of multiple cell types with distinct functions. Here we report the first single-nuclei RNA-seq transcriptomic study on human neural retinal tissue to identify transcriptome profile for individual cell types. Six retina samples from three healthy donors were profiled and RNA-seq data with high quality was obtained for 4730 single nuclei. All seven major cell types were observed from the dataset and signature genes for each cell type were identified by differential gene express analysis. The gene expression of the macular and peripheral retina was compared at the cell type level, showing significant improvement from previous bulk RNA-seq studies. Furthermore, our dataset showed improved power in prioritizing genes associated with human retinal diseases compared to both mouse single-cell RNA-seq and human bulk RNA-seq results. In conclusion, we demonstrated that feasibility of obtaining single cell transcriptome from human frozen tissues to provide additional insights that is missed by either the human bulk RNA-seq or the animal models.",

Many studies have revealed the regulation of absorption, metabolism, and transfer of nutrients in AMF and the genes involved in these processes. However, the spatial regulation of the genes among the structures comprising each developmental stage are not well understood. Here, we demonstrate the structure-specific transcriptome of the model AMF species, Rhizophagus irregularis. We performed an ultra-low input RNA-seq analysis, SMART-seq2, comparing five extraradical structures, germ tubes, runner hyphae, branched absorbing structures, immature spores, and mature spores. In addition, we reanalyzed the recently reported RNA-seq data comparing intraradical hyphae and arbuscules. Our analyses captured the distinct features of each structure and revealed the structure-specific expression patterns of genes related to absorption, metabolism, and transfer of nutrients. Of note, the transcriptional profiles suggest the distinct functions of branched absorbing structures in nutrient absorption. These findings provide a comprehensive dataset to advance our understanding of the transcriptional dynamics of fungal nutrition in this symbiotic system.",

We here leverage a highly specific and targeted rapid PCR methodology to quantitatively assess the genomic landscape of centromeres in cancer cell lines and primary tissue. PCR-based profiling of centromeres revealed widespread heterogeneity of centromeric and pericentromeric sequences in cancer cells and tissue as compared to healthy counterparts. Quantitative reductions in select centromeric core and pericentromeric markers were observed in neoplastic samples as compared to healthy counterparts. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis of a pericentromeric endogenous retrovirus amplified by PCR revealed possible gene conversion events occurring at numerous pericentromeric loci in the setting of malignancy. Our findings collectively represent the first look into centromere genetics in the setting of malignancy, providing valuable insight into the evolution and reshuffling of centromeric sequences in cancer development and progression.",

    "abstract": "Enteric-associated neurons (EANs) are closely associated with immune cells and continuously monitor and modulate homeostatic intestinal functions, including motility. Bidirectional interactions between immune and neuronal cells are altered during disease processes such as neurodegeneration or irritable bowel syndrome. We investigated how infection-induced inflammation affects intrinsic EANs and the role of intestinal muscularis macrophages (MMs) in this process. Using murine model of bacterial infection, we observed long-term gastrointestinal symptoms including reduced motility and subtype-specific neuronal loss. Neuronal-specific translational-profiling uncovered a caspase 11-dependent EAN cell-death mechanism induced by enteric infections. MMs responded to luminal infection by upregulating a neuroprotective program; gain- and loss-of-function experiments indicated that {beta}2-adrenergic receptor ({beta}2-AR) signaling in MMs mediates neuronal protection during infection via an arginase 1-polyamine axis. Our results identify a mechanism of neuronal cell death post-infection and point to a role for tissue-resident MMs in limiting neuronal damage.",

    "abstract": "Mechanism-based mathematical models are the foundation for diverse applications. It is often critical to explore the massive parametric space for each model. However, for many applications, such as agent-based models, partial differential equations, and stochastic differential equations, this practice can impose a prohibitive computational demand. To overcome this limitation, we present a fundamentally new framework to improve computational efficiency by orders of magnitude. The key concept is to train an artificial neural network using a limited number of simulations generated by a mechanistic model. This number is small enough such that the simulations can be completed in a short time frame but large enough to enable reliable training of the neural network. The trained neural network can then be used to explore the system dynamics of a much larger parametric space. We demonstrate this notion by training neural networks to predict self-organized pattern formation and stochastic gene expression. With this framework, we can predict not only the 1-D distribution in space (for partial differential equation models) and probability density function (for stochastic differential equation models) of variables of interest with high accuracy, but also novel system dynamics not present in the training sets. We further demonstrate that using an ensemble of neural networks enables the self-contained evaluation of the quality of each prediction. Our work can potentially be a platform for faster parametric space screening of biological models with user defined objectives.",

Conversely, under LC conditions Flv1/Flv3 acts only as a transient electron sink due to competing withdrawal of electrons by the highly induced NDH-1 complex. Further, in vivo evidence is provided indicating that Flv2/Flv4 contributes to the Mehler-like reaction when naturally expressed under LC conditions, or when artificially overexpressed under HC. The O2 photoreduction driven by Flv2/Flv4 occurs down-stream of PSI in a coordinated manner with Flv1/Flv3 and supports slow and steady-state O2 photoreduction.",

    "abstract": "The Wnt signaling pathway is of paramount importance for development and disease. However, the tissue-specific regulation of Wnt pathway activity remains incompletely understood. Here we identify FOXB2, an uncharacterized forkhead box family transcription factor, as a potent activator of Wnt signaling in normal and cancer cells. Mechanistically, FOXB2 induces the non-classical Wnt ligand WNT7B, which increases TCF/LEF-dependent transcription without activating LRP6 or {beta}-catenin. Proximity ligation and RNA interference identified YAP1, JUN, and DDX5 as transcriptional co-regulators required for FOXB2-dependent Wnt activation. Although FOXB2 expression is limited in adults, it is induced in select cancers, particularly advanced prostate cancer. RNA-seq data analysis suggests that FOXB2/WNT7B expression in prostate cancer is associated with a transcriptional program that favors neuronal differentiation and decreases recurrence-free survival. Consistently, FOXB2 is induced during neuroendocrine transformation of LNCaP prostate carcinoma cells, and conversely, FOXB2 overexpression is sufficient to induce their differentiation. Our results suggest that FOXB2 is a tissue-specific Wnt enhancer that promotes prostate cancer malignant transformation.",

    "abstract": "Vitamin A is a dietary component that is essential for the development of intestinal immunity. Vitamin A is absorbed and converted to its bioactive derivatives retinol and retinoic acid by the intestinal epithelium, yet little is known about how epithelial cells regulate vitamin A-dependent intestinal immunity. Here we show that epithelial cell expression of the transcription factor retinoic acid receptor {beta} (RAR{beta}) is essential for vitamin A-dependent intestinal immunity. Epithelial RAR{beta} activated vitamin A-dependent expression of serum amyloid A (SAA) proteins by binding directly to Saa promoters. In accordance with the known role of SAAs in regulating Th17 cell effector function, epithelial RAR{beta} promoted IL-17 production by intestinal Th17 cells. More broadly, epithelial RAR{beta} was required for the development of key vitamin A-dependent adaptive immune responses, including CD4+ T cell homing to the intestine and the development of immunoglobulin A-producing intestinal B cells. Our findings provide insight into how the intestinal epithelium senses dietary vitamin A status to regulate adaptive immunity and highlight the role of epithelial cells in regulating intestinal immunity in response to diet.\n\nSignificance StatementVitamin A is a nutrient that is essential for the development of intestinal immunity. It is absorbed by gut epithelial cells which convert it to retinol and retinoic acid. Here we show that the transcription factor retinoic acid receptor {beta} (RAR{beta}) allows epithelial cells to sense vitamin A in the diet and regulate vitamin A-dependent immunity in the intestine. We find that epithelial RAR{beta} regulates several intestinal immune responses, including production of the immunomodulatory protein serum amyloid A, T cell homing to the intestine, and B cell production of immunoglobulin A. Our findings provide new insight into how epithelial cells sense vitamin A to regulate intestinal immunity and highlight why vitamin A is so important for immunity to infection.",

We demonstrate in vitro that CTL4 and CTLMA2 intermolecular disulfide formation is promiscuous within this motif. Furthermore, CTL4 and CTLMA2 exhibit charge complementarity that promotes the formation of higher oligomeric states at physiological pH. Both lectins bind specific sugars, with an apparent preference for glycosaminoglycan motifs comprising {beta}1-3/{beta}1-4 linkages between glucose (Glc), galactose (Gal) and their respective hexosamines. Small-angle x-ray scattering data supports a compact heterodimer between the CTL domains. Recombinant CTL4/CTLMA2 is functional in vivo, reversing the enhancement of phenoloxidase activity in dsCTL4-treated mosquitoes. We propose these molecular features underline a common function for CTL4/CTLMA2 in mosquitoes, with species and strain-specific variation in degrees of activity in response to Plasmodium infection.\n\nAuthor SummaryMosquitoes of the genus Anopheles are vectors for the single-celled parasite Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria. Mosquitoes, like all insects, utilize the process of melanization for both wound healing and defense against pathogens. CTL4 and CTLMA2 are two proteins found in Anopheles mosquitoes that act as inhibitors of melanization, so understanding their molecular function is important to understanding the immune response of Anopheles mosquitoes to Plasmodium infection. We have purified CTL4 and CTLMA2 from two species of Anopheles and studied their molecular properties with a variety of biochemical and biophysical techniques. We also verified that our purified protein is functional by injecting it into mosquitoes. We learned that CTL4 and CTLMA2 are joined together by a disulfide bond between any one of three cysteine residues near the N-terminus of each protein. The CTL4/CTLMA2 complex is compact, but can associate into larger structures in solution, probably because of a loop in each protein that carries an opposite charge. The proteins cooperatively bind calcium and sugars, specifically glycosaminoglycan sugars, which are typically present in the connective tissues of insects. This information will aid in further investigations of the function of CTL4 and CTLMA2.",

    "abstract": "A number of small inhibitors have been developed in the recent years to target the cancer driving protein, K-Ras. In this study we propose and design a novel way of targeting oncogenic K-Ras4B.G12D with myristoylated cell penetrating peptides which become membrane anchored and lock the protein into an inactive state. In all atom molecular dynamics simulations such peptides associate with K-Ras4B exclusively at the effector binding region, which, in turn, expected to hinder the binding of down-stream effector proteins (e.g. C-Raf). The myristoylated R9 (Arg9) peptide strongly locks K-Ras4B.G12D into orientations that are unfavorable for effector binding. After breaking the cyclic structure and myristoylation, a cell penetrating peptide cyclorasin 9A5, which was designed for targeting the Ras: Raf interface, is also found to be effective in targeting the Ras: membrane interface. The myristoylated peptides likely have high cell permeability due to their mixed cationic/hydrophobic character at the N-terminus, while simultaneously the subsequent multiple charges help to maintain a strong association of the peptide with the K-Ras4B.G12D effector binding lobe. Targeting protein-membrane interfaces is starting to attract attention very recently, thanks to our understanding of the signaling mechanism of an increased number of peripheral membrane proteins. The strategy used in this study has potential applications in the design of drugs against K-Ras4B driven cancers. It also provides insights into the general principles of targeting protein-membrane interfaces.",

    "abstract": "Neurotrophins are critically involved in regulating in normal neural development and plasticity. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a neurotrophin that acts by binding to the tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) receptor, has also been implicated in the progression of several types of cancer. However, its role in medulloblastoma (MB), the most common type of malignant brain tumor afflicting children, remains unclear. Here we show that selective TrkB inhibition with the small molecule compound ANA-12 impaired proliferation and viability of human UW228 and D283 MB cells. These effects were accompanied by increased apoptosis, reduced extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) activity, increased expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and differential modulation of p21 expression dependent on the cell line. In addition, MB cells treated with ANA-12 showed morphological alterations consistent with differentiation, increased levels of the neural differentiation marker {beta}-III Tubulin (TUBB3), and reduced expression of the stemness marker Nestin. Finally, TrkB inhibition was able to slow the growth of MB tumors xenografted into nude mice. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that selective TrkB inhibition can display consistent anticancer effects in MB, possibly by modulating intracellular signaling and gene expression related to tumor progression, apoptosis, and differentiation.",

Patients with miRNA-138low/HIF1high signature were predominant in late stage. Further, bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that miRNA-138 directly targeted HIF1.

    "abstract": "The RNA guanine-7 methyltransferase (RNMT) in complex with RNMT-Activating Miniprotein (RAM) catalyses the formation of a N7-methylated guanosine cap structure on the 5 end of nascent RNA polymerase II transcripts. The mRNA cap protects the transcript from exonucleases and recruits cap-binding complexes that mediate RNA processing, export and translation. By using microsecond standard and accelerated molecular dynamics simulations, we provide for the first time a detailed molecular mechanism of allosteric regulation of RNMT by RAM. We show that RAM selects the RNMT active site conformations that are optimal for binding of substrates (AdoMet and the cap), thus enhancing their affinity. Furthermore, our results strongly suggest the likely scenario in which the cap binding promotes the subsequent AdoMet binding, consistent with the previously suggested cooperative binding model. By employing the dynamic network and community analyses, we revealed the underlying long-range allosteric networks and paths that are crucial for allosteric regulation by RAM. Our findings complement and explain previous experimental data on RNMT activity. Moreover, this study provides the most complete description of the cap and AdoMet binding poses and interactions within the enzymes active site. This information is critical for the drug discovery efforts that consider RNMT as a promising anti-cancer target.",

    "abstract": "RanBP2/Nup358 is one of the main components of the cytoplasmic filaments of the nuclear pore complex. It has been speculated that RanBP2, which has an E3 SUMO-ligase domain, may alter the composition of messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes as they emerge from the nuclear pore and thus regulate the ultimate fate of the mRNA in the cytoplasm. Four separate missense mutations in RanBP2 cause Acute Necrotizing Encephalopathy 1 (ANE1), which manifests as a sharp rise in cytokine production after common viral infections such as influenza and parainfluenza. However, how RanBP2 and its ANE1-associated mutations affect cytokine production is not well understood. Here we report that RanBP2 represses the translation of the interleukin-6 (IL6) mRNA, which encodes a cytokine that is aberrantly up-regulated in ANE1. Our data indicates that soon after its production, the IL6 mRNP recruits the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) bound to Let7 miRNA. After this mRNP is exported, RanBP2 sumoylates the RISC-component AGO1, thereby stabilizing it and enforcing mRNA silencing. Collectively, these results support a model whereby RanBP2 promotes an mRNP remodelling event that is critical for the miRNA-mediated suppression of clinically relevant mRNAs, such as IL6.",

The nucleus has recently emerged as an important factor in regulating 3D cell migration. At the onset of migratory behavior, cells often initiate the expression of vimentin, an intermediate filament protein which forms networks extending from a juxtanuclear cage to the cell periphery. However, the role of vimentin intermediate filaments (VIFs) in regulating nuclear shape and mechanics remains unknown. Here, we used wild type and vimentin-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts to show that VIFs regulate nuclear shape, motility, and the ability of cells to resist large deformations. The results show that loss of VIFs alters nuclear shape, reduces perinuclear stiffness, and enhances motility in 3D. These changes increase nuclear rupture and activation of DNA damage repair mechanisms, which are rescued by exogenous re-expression of vimentin. Our findings show that VIFs provide mechanical support to protect the nucleus and genome during migration.",

Our initial studies focused on the effects of the key mRNA-binding protein (mRBP) HuR on global transcriptomic changes incurred upon oxidant or electrophile stimulation. These data led us to discover a novel role of HuR in regulating Nrf2/AR, and in the process we further identified the related mRBP AUF1 as an additional novel Nrf2/AR regulator. Both mRBPs regulate AR by direct interaction with the Nrf2 transcript. Our data showed that HuR enhances Nrf2-mRNA maturation and promotes its nuclear export; whereas AUF1 stabilizes Nrf2-mRNA. Both mRBPs target the 3'-UTR of Nrf2-mRNA. Using an AR-reporter zebrafish strain, we document that this post-transcriptional control of AR is conserved at the whole-vertebrate level.",

With Gaussian Process models trained on a limited experimental set of 102 functionally characterized ChR variants, we designed high-photocurrent ChRs with unprecedented light sensitivity; three of these, ChRger1, ChRger2, and ChRger3, enable optogenetic activation of the nervous system via minimally-invasive systemic transgene delivery with rAAV-PHP.eB, which was not possible previously due to low per-cell transgene copy produced by systemic delivery.

    "abstract": "The matrix protein M1 of the Influenza A virus is considered to mediate viral assembly and budding at the plasma membrane (PM) of infected cells. In order for a new viral particle to form, the PM lipid bilayer has to bend into a vesicle towards the extracellular side. Studies in cellular models have proposed that different viral proteins might be responsible for inducing membrane curvature in this context (including M1), but a clear consensus has not been reached. In this study, we use a combination of fluorescence microscopy, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and scanning fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (sFCS) to investigate M1-induced membrane deformation in biophysical models of the PM. Our results indicate that M1 is indeed capable to cause membrane curvature in lipid bilayers containing negatively-charged lipids, in the absence of other viral components. Furthermore, we prove that simple protein binding is not sufficient to induce membrane restructuring. Rather, it appears that stable M1-M1 interactions and multimer formation are required in order to alter the bilayer three-dimensional structure, through the formation of a protein scaffold. Finally, our results suggest that, in a physiological context, M1-induced membrane deformation might be modulated by the initial bilayer curvature and the lateral organization of membrane components (i.e. the presence of lipid domains).",

    "abstract": "A variety of biological systems are not motile, but sessile in nature, relying on growth as the main driver of their movement. Groups of such growing organisms can form complex structures, such as the functional architecture of growing axons, or the adaptive structure of plant root systems. These processes are not yet understood, however the decentralized growth dynamics bear similarities to the collective behavior observed in groups of motile organisms, such as flocks of birds or schools of fish. Equivalent growth mechanisms make these systems amenable to a theoretical framework inspired by tropic responses of plants, where growth is considered implicitly as the driver of the observed bending towards a stimulus. We introduce two new concepts related to plant tropisms: point tropism, the response of a plant to a nearby point signal source, and allotropism, the growth-driven response of plant organs to neighboring plants. We first analytically and numerically investigate the 2D dynamics of single organs responding to point signals fixed in space. Building on this we study pairs of organs interacting via allotropism, i.e.each organ senses signals emitted at the tip of their neighbor and responds accordingly. In the case of local sensing we find a rich phase space. We describe the different phases, as well as the sharp transitions between them. We also find that the form of the phase space depends on initial conditions. This work sets the stage towards a theoretical framework for the investigation and understanding of systems of interacting growth-driven individuals.",

Here, using tumour cell subpopulations with different radiation sensitivities from prostate tumour cell lines, we show that radiation resistant cells enhance the survival and radiation resistance of radio-sensitive cells in spheroids but not in monolayer culture. Mathematical modelling indicates that these phenotypic changes result from both competitive and antagonistic cellular interactions in spheroids. Interactions mediated by oxygen constraints define the spatial localisation of the cell populations in spheroids and in xenografts, while those mediated by paracrine signals further modify the microenvironment. Our results show new mechanisms of radiotherapy resistance mediated by cellular interactions and by the microenvironment.",

    "abstract": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) selectively deliver highly toxic chemotherapeutic agents to target antigen-expressing cells and have become an important cancer treatment in recent years. However, the molecular mechanisms by which ADCs are internalized and activated within cells remain unclear. Here we use CRISPR-Cas9 screens to identify genes that control the toxicity of ADCs. Our results demonstrate critical roles for a range of known and novel endolysosomal trafficking regulators in ADC toxicity. We identify and characterize C18orf8/RMC1 as a regulator of ADC toxicity through its role in endosomal maturation. Through comparative analysis of CRISPR screens with ADCs bearing a noncleavable linker versus a cleavable valine-citrulline (VC) linker, we show that a subset of late endosomal and lysosomal regulators are selectively essential for toxicity of noncleavable linker ADCs. We further show that cleavable VC linkers are rapidly processed upon internalization and therefore surprisingly appear to bypass the requirement of lysosomal delivery. Lastly, we show that inhibition of sialic acid biosynthesis sensitizes cells to ADC treatment by increasing the rate of ADC internalization. This sensitization was observed using several ADCs targeting different antigens in diverse cancer cell types, including the FDA-approved ADC trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in Her2-positive breast cancer cells. Together, these results reveal novel regulators of endolysosomal trafficking, provide important insights to guide future ADC design, and identify candidate combination therapy targets as well as potential mechanisms of ADC resistance.",

    "abstract": "The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans is a bacterivore filter feeder. Through the contraction of the worms pharynx, a bacterial suspension is sucked into the pharynxs lumen. Excess liquid is then shunted out of the buccal cavity through ancillary channels that are made from specialized pharyngeal cells called marginal cells. Through the characterization of our library of worm-bioactive small molecules (a.k.a. wactives), we found that more than one third of wactives visibly accumulate inside of the marginal cells as crystals or globular spheres. Wactives that visibly accumulate are typically more hydrophobic than those that do not. To understand why wactives accumulate specifically in marginal cells, we performed a forward genetic screen for mutants that resist the lethality associated with one crystallizing wactive. We identified a presumptive sphingomyelin-synthesis pathway that is necessary for crystal and sphere accumulation. Sphingomyelin is a phospholipid that is enriched in the outer leaflet of the plasma membranes of most metazoans. We find that the predicted terminal enzyme of this pathway, sphingomyelin synthase 5 (SMS-5), is expressed in the pharynx, contributes to sphingomyelin abundance, and that its expression in marginal cells is sufficient for wactive accumulation. We also find that the expression of SMS-5 in the marginal cells is necessary for the proper absorption of exogenous cholesterol, without which C. elegans cannot develop. We conclude that the sphingomyelin-rich plasma membrane of the marginal cells acts as a sink to scavenge important hydrophobic nutrients from the filtered liquid that might otherwise be shunted back into the environment.\n\nOne sentence summaryThe anterior pharynx of C. elegans is a Sink for Hydrophobic Small Molecules",

    "abstract": "Every living cell releases extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are critical for cellular signaling and a wide range of biological functions. The potential diagnostic and therapeutic applications of EVs are well recognized, and rapidly expanding. While a complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning EVs release remains elusive, here we demonstrate a novel method for programmable control of the release of EVs and their cargo using external electric fields. As a proof of principle, we use cultured rat astrocytes to demonstrate how the frequency of external electrical stimulation selectively modulates EV release, their surface proteins, and microRNA profiles. This method could broadly impact biological science and medical applications. First, it raises an interesting question of how endogenous electrical activity could modulate EV production. Second, it provides a novel mechanism for tuning therapeutic electrical stimulation that may be useful for treating brain disorders. Third, it provides a new way to generate EVs carrying desired cargos by tuning electrical stimulation parameters. Unlike chemical methods for creating EVs, electrical stimulation is a clean physical method with adjustable parameters including stimulation frequency, field strength and waveform morphology.",

Citron kinase is one important component required for MR formation but its mechanisms of action and relationship with Rho are controversial. Here, we conduct a structure-function analysis of the Drosophila Citron kinase, Sticky, in Schneiders S2 cells. We define two separable and redundant RhoGEF/Pebble-dependent inputs into Sticky recruitment to the nascent MR and show that each input is subsequently required for retention at, and for the integrity of, the mature MR. The first input is via an actomyosin-independent interaction between Sticky and Anillin, a key scaffold also required for MR formation. The second input requires the Rho-binding domain of Sticky, whose boundaries we have defined. Collectively, these results show how MR biogenesis depends on the coordinated actions of Sticky, Anillin and Rho.",

    "abstract": "The neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin and their receptors have established roles in the regulation of mammalian social behavior including parental care, sex, affiliation and pair-bonding, but less is known regarding their relationship to social dominance and subordination within social hierarchies. We have previously demonstrated that male mice can form stable linear dominance hierarchies with individuals occupying one of three classes of social status: alpha, subdominant, subordinate. Alpha males exhibit high levels of aggression and rarely receive aggression. Subdominant males exhibit aggression towards subordinate males but also receive aggression from more dominant individuals. Subordinate males rarely exhibit aggression and receive aggression from more dominant males. Here, we examined whether variation in social status was associated with levels of oxytocin (OTR) and vasopressin 1a (V1aR) receptor binding in socially relevant brain regions. We found that socially dominant males had significantly higher OTR binding in the nucleus accumbens core than subordinate animals. Alpha males also had higher OTR binding in the anterior olfactory nucleus, posterior part of the cortical amygdala and rostral lateral septum compared to more subordinate individuals. Conversely, alpha males had lower V1aR binding in the rostral lateral septum and lateral preoptic area compared to subordinates. These observed relationships have two potential explanations. Preexisting individual differences in the patterns of OTR and V1aR binding may underlie behavioral differences that promote or inhibit the acquisition of social status. More likely, the differential social environments experienced by dominant and subordinate animals may shift receptor expression, potentially facilitating the expression of adaptive social behaviors.\n\nHighlightsO_LIMice living in social hierarchies express different levels of oxytocin receptor (OTR) and vasopressin 1a receptor (V1aR) binding in various brain regions according to their social status.\nC_LIO_LIAlphas and subdominants have higher OTR binding in the nucleus accumbens compared to subordinates.\nC_LIO_LIAlphas have higher OTR binding in the anterior olfactory nucleus compared to subdominants and subordinates.\nC_LIO_LIAlphas have higher OTR and lower V1aR binding in the rostral lateral septum compared to subordinates.\nC_LIO_LIAlphas have lower V1aR binding in the lateral preoptic area compared to subordinates.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are critical, and so are the databases and tools (resources) concerning PPIs. But in absence of systematic comparisons, biologists/bioinformaticians may be forced to make a subjective selection among such protein interaction databases and tools. In fact, a comprehensive list of such bioinformatics resources has not been reported so far. For the first time, we compiled 375 PPI resources, short-listed and performed preliminary comparison of 125 important ones (both lists available publicly at startbioinfo.com), and then systematically compared human PPIs from 16 carefully-selected databases. General features have been first compared in detail. The coverage of  experimentally verified vs. all PPIs, as well as those significant in case of disease-associated and other types of genes among the chosen databases has been compared quantitatively. This has been done in two ways: outputs manually obtained using web-interfaces, and all interactions downloaded from the databases. For the first approach, PPIs obtained in response to gene queries using the web interfaces were compared. As a query set, 108 genes associated with different tissues (specific to kidney, testis, and uterus, and ubiquitous) or diseases (breast cancer, lung cancer, Alzheimers, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, and cardiomyopathy) were chosen. PPI-coverage for well-studied genes was also compared with that of less-studied ones. For the second approach, the back-end-data from the databases was downloaded and compared. Based on the results, we recommend the use of STRING and UniHI for retrieving the majority of  experimentally verified protein interactions, and hPRINT and STRING for obtaining maximum number of  total (experimentally verified as well as predicted) PPIs. The analysis of experimentally verified PPIs found exclusively in each database revealed that STRING contributed about 71% of exclusive hits. Overall, hPRINT, STRING and IID together retrieved ~94% of  total protein interactions available in the databases. The coverage of certain databases was skewed for some gene-types. The results also indicate that the database usage frequency may not correlate with their advantages, thereby justifying the need for more frequent studies of this nature.",

    "abstract": "Hippocampal network activity is tightly regulated by local inhibitory interneurons. Suppression of inhibition has been proposed to accelerate learning by enhancing network activity and plasticity; however, the activity dynamics of hippocampal interneurons during learning remain poorly understood. Furthermore, it is unknown if individual interneurons are stochastically suppressed across different learning episodes, mirroring the random remapping of place cells, or if instead they exhibit consistent patterns of activity suppression. These critical properties define how inhibition shapes and controls learning at a network level. To uncover the functional circuit dynamics of inhibition during novelty-induced learning, we recorded calcium activity from hippocampal CA1 interneurons using two-photon imaging as mice learned a virtual reality (VR) goal-directed spatial navigation task in new visual contexts. Here we focused on dendrite-targeting somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SOM-ints), which powerfully control burst firing and synaptic plasticity in excitatory neurons. We found robust activity suppression in SOM-ints upon exposure to novel virtual environments; activity then recovered over repeated exposures to the novel environment as the animal learned goal locations. At a population level, we found a continuum of activity suppression, from interneurons strongly suppressed to moderately activated during learning. Surprisingly, each interneuron exhibited a stable level of activity modulation: when animals were switched into a second novel environment, the magnitude of activity suppression was strongly correlated across remapping sessions. This work reveals dynamic inhibition suppression triggered by novel environments and the gradual return of inhibition with learning. Furthermore, unlike the stochastic remapping of place cells, inhibitory networks display a stable activity structure across learning episodes. This functional inhibitory circuit architecture suggests that individual interneurons play specialized and stereotyped roles during learning, perhaps by differentially regulating pyramidal subnetworks specialized for plasticity and stability.",

    "abstract": "Cells regulate gene expression in response to salient external stimuli. In neurons, depolarization leads to the expression of inducible transcription factors (ITFs) that direct subsequent gene regulation. Depolarization encodes both a neurons action potential (AP) output and synaptic inputs, via excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). However, it is unclear if different types of depolarizing signals can be transformed by an ITF into distinct modes of genomic regulation. Here, we show that APs and EPSPs in the murine hippocampus trigger two spatially segregated and molecularly distinct mechanisms that lead to the expression of the ITF NPAS4. These two pathways culminate in the assembly of unique, stimulus-specific NPAS4 heterodimers that exhibit distinctive DNA binding patterns. Thus, NPAS4 independently communicates increases in a neurons spiking output and synaptic inputs to the nucleus, enabling gene regulation to be tailored to the type of depolarizing activity experienced by a neuron.",

    "abstract": "Sleep deprivation induces a characteristic rebound in NREM sleep accompanied by an immediate increase in the power of delta (0.5 - 4 Hz) oscillations, proportional to the prior time awake. To test the idea that galanin neurons in the mouse lateral preoptic hypothalamus (LPO) regulate this sleep homeostasis, they were selectively genetically ablated. The baseline sleep architecture of LPO-{Delta}Gal mice became heavily fragmented, their average core body temperature permanently increased (by about 2{degrees}C) and the diurnal variations in body temperature across the sleep-wake cycle also markedly increased. Additionally, LPO-{Delta}Gal mice showed a striking spike in body temperature and increase in wakefulness at a time (ZT24) when control mice were experiencing the opposite - a decrease in body temperature and becoming maximally sleepy (start of \"lights on\"). After sleep deprivation sleep homeostasis was largely abolished in LPO-{Delta}Gal mice: the characteristic increase in the delta power of NREM sleep following sleep deprivation was absent, suggesting that LPO galanin neurons track the time spent awake. Moreover, the amount of recovery sleep was substantially reduced over the following hours. We also found that the 2 adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine, used for long-term sedation during intensive care, requires LPO galanin neurons to induce both the NREM-like state with increased delta power and the reduction in body temperature, characteristic features of this drug. This suggests that dexmedetomidine over-activates the natural sleep homeostasis pathway via galanin neurons. Collectively, the results emphasize that NREM sleep and the concurrent reduction in body temperature are entwined at the circuit level.\n\nSignificanceCatching up on lost sleep (sleep homeostasis) is a common phenomenon in mammals, but there is no circuit explanation for how this occurs. We have discovered that galanin neurons in the hypothalamus are essential for sleep homeostasis as well as for the control of body temperature. This is the first time that a neuronal cell type has been identified that underlies sleep homeostasis. Moreover, we show that activation of these galanin neurons are also essential for the actions of the 2 adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine, which induces both hypothermia together with powerful delta oscillations resembling NREM sleep. Thus, sleep homeostasis, temperature control and sedation by 2 adrenergic agonists can all be linked at the circuit level by hypothalamic galanin neurons.",

It has been proposed that feed-forward inputs to basal dendrites drive a neurons stimulus preference, while feedback inputs to apical dendrites sharpen selectivity. However, how a neurons dendritic domains relate to its functional selectivity has not been demonstrated experimentally. We performed 2-photon dendritic micro-dissection on layer-2/3 pyramidal neurons in mouse primary visual cortex. We found that removing the apical dendritic tuft did not alter orientation-tuning. Furthermore, orientation-tuning curves were remarkably robust to the removal of basal dendrites: ablation of 2-3 basal dendrites was needed to cause a small shift in orientation preference, without significantly altering tuning width. Computational modeling corroborated our results and put limits on how orientation preferences among basal dendrites differ in order to reproduce the post-ablation data.
