    "abstract": "BackgroundIn India, the potential risk factors influencing female infertility are not well-characterized. Hence, this study was initially aimed to determine the multi-factor risk-predictive models for the infertile females from different Indian ethnics. Afterwards, when treatment was performed for correcting the abnormal demographic and clinical parameters obtained from our initial findings, some of the patients were observed to be treatment-non-responsive. This further recommended assessing the expression pattern of GDF9 and BMP15 mRNAs in those unexplained infertile females.\n\nMethodologyThis study included 470 Primary, 209 Secondary infertile and 419 age-matched Healthy females, where baseline demographic and clinicopathological factors were assessed. Additionally, from the treatment-non-responsive patients, laparoscopy and trans-vaginal ultrasound-guided collection of ovarian follicular fluid were done for studying the expression pattern of GDF9 and BMP15 mRNAs using q-PCR.\n\nPrincipal FindingsMid-education level, no contraception usage and duration of infertility for >2 years were the critical risk factors for female infertility (OR>>1; p<0.05), whereas elevated platelet count showed ~10-fold more risk of having secondary infertility and high ESR showed 3.33-fold increased threat of primary infertility. Besides, abnormal MCV, LH/FSH ratio, mild-anaemia and hypothyroidism were the best risk-predictive multi-factor model. After correcting these abnormal clinical factors, 6.8% of the patients were treatment-non-responsive, where elevated ESR, hypothyroidism and anaemia remained uncorrected. Interestingly, in those unexplained cases, GDF9 and BMP15 mRNAs were significantly down-regulated (2-4 fold) irrespective of age groups. Additionally, for predicting female infertility, the cut-off for the expression level of GDF9 and BMP15 mRNAs were estimated -2.09 and -2.75, respectively, with a relatively high sensitivity ([&ge;]62.5%) and specificity (75%).\n\nConclusionsGDF9 and BMP15 mRNAs may be considered as molecular markers for predicting female infertility. Their down-regulation along with hypothyroidism and anaemia probably led to the treatment-non-responsiveness, thus, those patients may be advised to assisted reproductive technology with supplementation of exogenous GDF9 and/or BMP15.",

    "abstract": "How gene function evolves is a central question of evolutionary biology. It can be investigated by comparing functional genomics results between species and between genes. Most comparative studies of functional genomics have used pairwise comparisons. Yet it has been shown that this can provide biased results, since genes, like species, are phylogenetically related. Phylogenetic comparative methods should allow to correct for this, but they depend on strong assumptions, including unbiased tree estimates relative to the hypothesis being tested. Such methods have recently been used to test the \"ortholog conjecture\", the hypothesis that functional evolution is faster in paralogs than in orthologs. Whereas pairwise comparisons of tissue specificity ({tau}) provided support for the ortholog conjecture, phylogenetic independent contrasts did not. Our reanalysis on the same gene trees identified problems with the time calibration of duplication nodes. We find that the gene trees used suffer from important biases, due to the inclusion of trees with no duplication nodes, to the relative age of speciations and duplications, to systematic differences in branch lengths, and to non-Brownian motion of tissue-specificity on many trees. We find that incorrect implementation of phylogenetic method in empirical gene trees with duplications can be problematic. Controlling for biases allows to successfully use phylogenetic methods to study the evolution of gene function, and provides some support for the ortholog conjecture using three different phylogenetic approaches.",

    "abstract": "Thousands of genomic structural variants segregate in the human population and can impact phenotypic traits and diseases. Their identification in whole-genome sequence data of large cohorts is a major computational challenge. We describe a novel approach, PopDel, which jointly identifies deletions of about 500 to at least 10,000 bp in length in many genomes together. PopDel scales to tens of thousands of genomes as we demonstrate in evaluations on up to 49,962 genomes. We show that PopDel reliably reports common, rare and de novo deletions. On genomes with available high-confidence reference call sets PopDel shows excellent recall and precision. Genotype inheritance patterns in up to 6,794 trios indicate that genotypes predicted by PopDel are more reliable than those of previous SV callers. Furthermore, PopDels running time is competitive with the fastest tested previous tools. The demonstrated scalability and accuracy of PopDel enables routine scans for deletions in large-scale sequencing studies.",

Here, we report a genetically-informed neuroimaging study of real-world risky behaviour across the domains of drinking, smoking, driving, and sexual behaviour, in a European sample from the UK Biobank (N= 12,675). We find negative associations between risky behaviour and grey matter volume (GMV) in distinct brain regions, including amygdala, ventral striatum, hypothalamus, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). These effects replicate in an independent sample recruited from the same population (N=13,004). Polygenic risk scores for risky behaviour, derived from a genome-wide association study in an independent sample (N=297,025), are inversely associated with GMV in dlPFC, putamen, and hypothalamus. This relation mediates ~2.2% of the association between genes and behaviour. Our results highlight distinct heritable neuroanatomical features as manifestations of the genetic propensity for risk taking.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryRisky behaviour and its genetic associations are linked to less grey matter volume in distinct brain regions.",

    "abstract": "Several monosaccharides constitute naturally occurring glycans but it is uncertain if they constitute a universal set like the alphabets of proteins and DNA. Based on the available experimental observations, it is hypothesized herein that the glycan alphabet is not universal. Data on the presence / absence of pathways for the biosynthesis of 55 monosaccharides in 12939 completely sequenced archaeal and bacterial genomes are presented in support of this hypothesis. Pathways were identified by searching for homologs of biosynthesis pathway enzymes. Substantial variations are observed in the set of monosaccharides used by organisms belonging to the same phylum, genera and even species. Monosaccharides are grouped as Common, Less Common and Rare based on their prevalence in Archaea and Bacteria. It is observed that fewer enzymes suffice to biosynthesize the Common group. It appears that the Common group originated before the formation of three domains of life. In contrast, the Rare group are confined to a few species in a few phyla, suggesting that they evolved much later. Fold conservation, as observed in aminotransferases and SDR superfamily members involved in monosaccharide biosynthesis, suggests neo- and sub-functionalization of genes leading to the formation of Rare group monosaccharides. Non-universality of the glycan alphabet begets questions about the role of different monosaccharides in determining an organisms fitness.\n\nImpact statementCarbohydrates, nucleic acids and proteins are important classes of biological macromolecules. The universality of DNA, RNA and protein alphabets has been established beyond doubt. However, the universality of glycan alphabet is unknown primarily because of the challenges associated with the elucidation of glycan structures. This has precluded a comprehensive investigation of glycan alphabet. To address this challenge, we have identified the prevalence of 55 monosaccharide biosynthesis pathways in 12939 completely sequenced archaeal and bacterial genomes by searching for homologs of biosynthesis pathway enzymes using HMM profiles, and in a few cases, BLASTp. This revealed that the glycan alphabet is highly variable; in fact, significant differences are found even among different strains of a species. Possible implications of this variability may be significant in understanding the evolution of Archaea and Bacteria in diverse and competitive environments. Factors that drive the choice of monosaccharides used by an organism need to be investigated, and will be of interest in understanding host-pathogen interactions. Additionally, the knowledge of glycan alphabet can be employed for structural characterization / validation of glycans inferred using mass spectrometry. Knowledge of unique monosaccharides and biosynthetic enzymes can also be used as novel drug targets against human pathogens.\n\nData summaryThe curated set of proteins used in this study, with domain assignment, is listed in supplementary_data.xlsx. Corresponding 396 references with evidence of experimental characterization are included in supplementary material.

In this study, we explore these hidden costs by developing and validating a conceptual model of indebtedness across three studies that combine a large scale online questionnaire, an interpersonal game, computational modeling, and neuroimaging. Our model captures how individuals perceive the altruistic and strategic intentions of the benefactor. These inferences produce distinct feelings of guilt and obligation that together comprise indebtedness and motivate reciprocity. Perceived altruistic intentions convey care and concern and are associated with activity in insula, ventromedial prefrontal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, while inferred strategic intentions convey expectations of future reciprocity and are associated with activation in temporal parietal junction and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. We further develop a neural utility model of indebtedness using multivariate patterns of brain activity that captures the tradeoff between these feelings and reliably predicts reciprocity behavior.",

    "abstract": "The social environment strongly affects the physiological stress response in group living animals, which in turn can affect the immune system and increase susceptibility to parasites. Here, I investigate relationships between social behavior and gastrointestinal parasite product excretion in the carrion crow (Corvus corone). Individuals from a population of non-cooperatively breeding carrion crows excreted less samples containing coccidian oocysts when kept in larger groups (8 or 9 individuals) compared to those individuals kept in smaller groups (2 or 3 individuals). Lower-ranking individuals excreted more samples containing parasite oocysts compared to higher-ranking individuals. The strength of affiliative relationships and number of related individuals in the group did not relate to the proportion of droppings containing coccidian oocysts. The present results confirm an association between social environment and parasite excretion patterns in carrion crows, but the patterns described in the present study differ from previously published data derived from a group of cooperatively breeding crows. This illustrates that differences between the social systems of carrion crows might result in different associations between the social environment and parasite product excretion patterns.\n\nSignificance statementOne major cost of group living is an increase in susceptibility to parasites, however not all group living animals are affected by this in the same way. A better understanding how social behavior is associated with parasite burden can help to better understand evolution of group living. This study attempts to investigate associations between dominance rank, affiliative relationships as well as groups size and gastrointestinal parasite product excretion in a group of captive carrion crows. Lower-ranking individuals excreted more samples containing parasite oocysts compared to higher-ranking individuals, confirming an association between social relationships within the groups (for example dominance rank) and parasite excretion patterns.",

    "abstract": "Timing and its variability are crucial for behavior. Consequently, neural circuits that take part in the control of timing and in the measurement of temporal intervals have been the subject of much research. Here, we provide an analytical and computational account of the temporal variability in what is perhaps the most basic model of a timing circuit, the synfire chain. First, we study the statistical structure of trial-to-trial timing variability in a reduced but analytically tractable model: a chain of single integrate-and-fire neurons. We show that this circuits variability is well-described by a generative model consisting of local, global, and jitter components. We relate each of these components to distinct neural mechanisms in the model. Next, we establish in simulations that these results carry over to a noisy homogeneous synfire chain. Finally, motivated by the fact that a synfire chain is thought to underlie the circuit that takes part in the control and timing of zebra finch song, we present simulations of a biologically realistic synfire chain model of the zebra finch timekeeping circuit. We find the structure of trial-to-trial timing variability to be consistent with our previous findings, and to agree with experimental observations of the songs temporal variability. Our study therefore provides a possible neuronal account of behavioral variability in zebra finches.",

According to the existing paradigm, MCU is occluded at the resting cytosolic [Ca2+] and only opens above an [~]400 nM threshold. This Ca2+-dependent gating is putatively conferred by MICUs, EF hand-containing auxiliary subunits that block/unblock the MCU pore depending on cytosolic [Ca2+]. Here we provide the first direct, patch-clamp based analysis of the Ca2+-dependent MCU gating and the role played by MICUs. Surprisingly, MICUs do not occlude the MCU pore, and MCU is a constitutively active channel without cytosolic [Ca2+] activation threshold. Instead, MICUs potentiate MCU activity when cytosolic Ca2+ binds to their EF hands. MICUs cause this potentiation by increasing the probability of open state of the MCU channel.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryAuxiliary MICU subunits do not occlude the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) but increase its activity as cytosolic Ca2+ is elevated.",

    "abstract": "Compelling evidence suggests the need for more data per individual to reliably map the functional organization of the human connectome. As the notion that  more data is better emerges as a golden rule for functional connectomics, researchers find themselves grappling with the challenges of how to obtain the desired amounts of data per participant in a practical manner, particularly for retrospective data aggregation. Increasingly, the aggregation of data across all fMRI scans available for an individual is being viewed as a solution, regardless of scan condition (e.g., rest, task, movie). A number of open questions exist regarding the aggregation process and the impact of different decisions on the reliability of resultant aggregate data. We leveraged the availability of highly sampled test-retest datasets to systematically examine the impact of data aggregation strategies on the reliability of cortical functional connectomics. Specifically, we compared functional connectivity estimates derived after concatenating from: 1) multiple scans under the same state, 2) multiple scans under different states (i.e. hybrid or general functional connectivity), and 3) subsets of one long scan. We also varied connectivity processing (i.e. global signal regression, ICA-FIX, and task regression) and estimation procedures. When the total number of time points is equal, and the scan state held constant, concatenating multiple shorter scans had a clear advantage over a single long scan. However, this was not necessarily true when concatenating across different fMRI states (i.e. task conditions), where the reliability from the aggregate data varied across states. Concatenating fewer numbers of states that are more reliable tends to yield higher reliability. Our findings provide an overview of multiple dependencies of data concatenation that should be considered to optimize reliability in analysis of functional connectivity data.",

    "abstract": "Management of the COVID-19 pandemic requires widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing. A main limitation for widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing is the global shortage of essential supplies, among these, RNA extraction kits. The need for commercial RNA extraction kits places a bottleneck on tests that detect SARS-CoV-2 genetic material, including PCR-based reference tests. Here we propose an alternative method we call PEARL (Precipitation Enhanced Analyte RetrievaL) that addresses this limitation. PEARL uses a lysis solution that disrupts cell membranes and viral envelopes while simultaneously providing conditions suitable for alcohol-based precipitation of RNA, DNA, and proteins. PEARL is a fast, low-cost, and simple method that uses common laboratory reagents and offers comparable performance to commercial RNA extraction kits. PEARL offers an alternative method to isolate host and pathogen nucleic acids and proteins to streamline the detection of DNA and RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Tumor emboli - aggregates of tumor cell within vessels - pose a clinical challenge as they are associated with increased metastasis and tumor recurrence. When growing within a vessel, tumor emboli are subject to a unique mechanical constraint provided by the tubular geometry of the vessel. Current models of tumor emboli use unconstrained multicellular tumor spheroids, which neglect this mechanical interplay. Here, we modelled a lymphatic vessel as a 200 m-diameter channel in either a stiff or soft, bioinert agarose matrix, and we modelled colon or breast cancer tumor emboli with aggregates of HCT116 or SUM149PT cells, respectively. The stiff vessel model constrained the tumor emboli to the cylindrical geometry, which led to continuous growth of the emboli, in contrast to the growth plateau that unconstrained spheroids exhibit. Emboli morphology in the soft vessel model, however, was dependent on the magnitude of mechanical mismatch between the vessel matrix and the cell aggregates. In general, when the elastic modulus of the vessel was greater than the emboli (Eves / Eemb > 1), the emboli were constrained to grow within the vessel geometry, and when the elastic modulus of the vessel was less than the emboli (0 < Eves / Eemb < 1), the emboli bulged into the matrix. Inhibitors of myosin-related force generation decreased the elastic modulus and/or increased the stress relaxation of the tumor cell aggregates, effectively increasing the mechanical mismatch. The increased mechanical mismatch after drug treatment was correlated with increased confinement of tumor emboli growth along the vessel, which may translate to increased tumor burden due to the increased tumor volume within the diffusion distance of nutrients and oxygen.\n\nINSIGHT BOXThe growth of tumor emboli--aggregates of tumor cells within vessels--is associated with aggressive cancer progression and metastasis. Models of their growth have not taken into account their biomechanical context, where radial expansion is constrained, but lengthwise expansion is free in the vessel. Here, we modelled the vessel geometry with a cylindrical microchannel in a hydrogel. In contrast to unconstrained or fully embedded aggregates, vessel-like constraint promotes growth of emboli in our model. The growth advantage is increased when the matrix is stiffened or actomyosin contractility weakened, both of which effectively increase the magnitude of mechanical constraint. This study sheds light on increased tumor burden in vessel-based growth and indicates a need to study tumor progression in similar environments.",

    "abstract": "The successful production of recombinant protein for biochemical, biophysical and structural biological studies critically depends on the correct expression organism. Currently the most commonly used expression organisms for structural studies are E. coli (ca. 70% of all PDB structures) and the baculovirus/ insect cell expression system (ca. 5% of all PDB structures). While insect cell expression is frequently successful for large eukaryotic proteins, it is relatively expensive and time consuming compared to E. coli expression. Frequently the decision to carry out a baculovirus project means restarting cloning from scratch. Here we describe an integrated system that allows the simultaneous cloning into E. coli and baculovirus expression vectors using the same PCR products. The system offers a flexible array of N- and C-terminal affinity, solublisation and utility tags, and the speed allows expression screening to be completed in E. coli, before carrying out time and cost intensive experiments in baculovirus. Importantly, we describe a means of rapidly generating polycistronic bacterial constructs based on the hugely successful biGBac system, making InteBac of particular interest for researchers working on recombinant protein complexes.",

The aim of this study was to perform a comprehensive evolutionary analysis to describe the human outbreak and the evolutionary rate of different genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe molecular evolution in nine genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed using three different approaches: phylogenetic signal assessment, emergence of amino acid substitutions, and Bayesian evolutionary rate estimation in eight successive fortnights since the virus emergence.\n\nAll observed phylogenetic signals were very low and trees topologies were in agreement with those signals. However, after four months of evolution, it was possible to identify regions revealing an incipient viral lineages formation despite the low phylogenetic signal, since fortnight 3. Finally, the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary rate for regions nsp3 and S, the ones presenting greater variability, was estimated to values of 1.37 x 10-3 and 2.19 x 10-3 substitution/site/year, respectively.\n\nIn conclusion, results obtained in this work about the variable diversity of crucial viral regions and the determination of the evolutionary rate are consequently decisive to understand essential feature of viral emergence. In turn, findings may allow characterizing for the first time, the evolutionary rate of S protein that is crucial for vaccines development.",

    "abstract": "Image differences between the eyes can cause millisecond-scale interocular differences in processing speed. For moving objects, these differences can cause dramatic misperceptions of distance and 3D direction. Here, we develop a continuous target-tracking paradigm that shows these tiny differences in the speed of visual processing are preserved in the movement dynamics of the hand. Human observers continuously tracked a target stimulus with various luminance differences across the eyes as it underwent Brownian motion in the horizontal plane. We show that suitable analysis recovers the time course of the visuomotor response, and comparisons across luminance conditions reveal the temporal evolution of visual processing differences between the eyes. Additionally, using a direct within-observer comparison, we show that target tracking and traditional psychophysics provide scalar estimates of interocular delays that agree on average to within a fraction of a millisecond. Thus, target tracking accurately recovers millisecond-scale differences in processing speed while revealing the millisecond-by-millisecond time course of visual processing, all in a fraction of the time required by traditional methods. This paradigm provides the potential for new predictive power, the application of analytical techniques from computational neuroscience, and the rapid measurement of clinical and developmental populations in which traditional psychophysics might be impractical.",

    "abstract": "Landscape connectedness shapes the exchange of individuals among patches, and hence metapopulation connectivity and dynamics. Connectedness, and its resulting effects on connectivity are therefore rightfully central in conservation biology. However, besides determining demographic fluxes of individuals between patches, connectedness also generates phenotypic sorting and thus impacts local and regional eco-evolutionary dynamics. Despite the central role of connectedness, its effects on individual phenotypic heterogeneity and spatial organization are so far neglected in theory and applications.\n\nThrough experimental metapopulations of Tetranychus urticae (two-spotted spider mite) with three levels of landscape connectedness and by regularly removing phenotypic structure in a subset of these populations, we tested how regional and local population dynamics are determined both by network connectedness and phenotypic spatial organization.\n\nWe find that the self-organizing phenotypic spatial structure increases local equilibrium population sizes and variability. It in contrast dampens the effects of imposed connectedness differences on population sizes and is therefore anticipated to improve metapopulation persistence. Contrary to theoretical expectations, the most locally connected patches within the network showed an overall reduced local population size, possibly originating from a faster depletion of resources from immigrants or transiting individuals.\n\nThis experiment shows how metapopulation dynamics can significantly deviate from theoretical expectations due to individual heterogeneity. This potential rescue effect stemming from phenotypical self-organization in space is a key point to consider for conservation actions, especially based on translocations.",

    "abstract": "Innate behaviours, though robust and hard wired, rely on modulation of neuronal circuits, for eliciting an appropriate response according to internal states and external cues. Drosophila flight is one such innate behaviour that is modulated by intracellular calcium release through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs). Cellular mechanism(s) by which IP3Rs modulate neuronal function for specific behaviours remain speculative, in vertebrates and invertebrates. To address this, we generated an inducible dominant negative form of the IP3R (IP3RDN). Flies with neuronal expression of IP3RDN exhibit flight deficits. Spatiotemporal expression of IP3RDN helped identify key flight-modulating dopaminergic neurons with axonal projections in the mushroom body. Attenuation of IP3R function in these presynaptic dopaminergic neurons resulted in flies with shortened flight bouts and a disinterest in seeking food, accompanied by reduced excitability and dopamine release upon cholinergic stimulation. Our findings suggest that the same neural circuit modulates the drive for food search and for undertaking longer flight bouts.",

In contrast, direct evidence based on the reliable bioanalytical method for the exposure of AA is still lacking and not universal. Here, we strictly complied with the qualitative and quantitative guidance for forensic toxicological analysis: In the sample preprocessing, DNA from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues was digested to single nucleotide by a series of enzymes with 70% enzymatic digestion efficiency. After protein precipitation, the samples were submitted to an ABI6500+ mass spectrometer for LC-MS/MS analysis. Ion pairs 543.2/427.2 and 543.2/395.2 of dA-AAI were selected from 5 ion pairs due to their higher LC-MS/MS response. Both these ion pairs have excellent selectivity and specificity in rat liver DNA matrix, and a linear regression range from 5 pg/mL to 200 pg/mL with the best fit and determination coefficient (r) greater than 0.99. The intra and inter batch accuracy and precision of these two ion pairs are also acceptable with less than 15% variation. The total recovery for ion pair 543.2/427.2 and 543.2/395.2 of dA-AAI was 90.06% and 90.76%, respectively. Our method has a minor matrix effect and good stability under different temperature and time conditions. With signal to noise ratio [&ge;] 3, 2 ion pairs (< 50 % relative abundance variation), the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of our method is set to 5 pg/mL([~]3.6 AAI-DNA adducts per 108 DNA bases). By using this validated bioanalytical method of dA-AAI, 165 human HCC FFPE tissues were analyzed, the total ratio of samples with peak543.2/427.2 is 17.0% (28/165), with peak543.2/395.2 is 9.09% (15/165) which yields the total ratio of samples combined peak543.2/427.2 and peak543.2/395.2 is 7.27% (12/165).

    "abstract": "Introductory biology lessons around the world typically teach that plants absorb water through their roots, but, unfortunately, absorption of water through leaves and subsequent transport and use of this water for biomass formation remains a field limited mostly to specialists. Recent studies have identified foliar water uptake as a significant but still unquantified net water source for terrestrial plants. The growing interest in the development of a new model that includes foliar uptake of liquid water to explain hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios in leaf water and tree rings requires a method for distinguishing between these two water sources. I therefore devised a method utilizing two different heavy waters (HDO and H218O) to simultaneously label both foliar-uptake water and root-uptake water and quantify their relative contributions to plant biomass. Using this new method, I here present evidence that, in the case of well-watered Cryptomeria japonica, hydrogen and oxygen incorporated into new leaf cellulose in the rainy season derives mostly from foliar-uptake water, while that of new root cellulose derives mostly from root-uptake water, and new branch xylem is somewhere in between. Abandoning the assumption that these elements are supplied from soil water alone may have vast implications in fields ranging from isotope dendroclimatology, silviculture, to biogeochemistry.",

Lipid droplets (LD) are organelles with major functions in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis, and have multiple roles in infections and inflammation. Here we described that monocytes from COVID-19 patients have an increased LD accumulation compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative donors. In vitro, SARS-CoV-2 infection modulates pathways of lipid synthesis and uptake, including CD36, SREBP-1, PPAR{gamma} and DGAT-1 in monocytes and triggered LD formation in different human cells. LDs were found in close apposition with SARS-CoV-2 proteins and double-stranded (ds)-RNA in infected cells. Pharmacological modulation of LD formation by inhibition of DGAT-1 with A922500 significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication as well as reduced production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Taken together, we demonstrate the essential role of lipid metabolic reprograming and LD formation in SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis, opening new opportunities for therapeutic strategies to COVID-19.",

Although a preliminary understanding of the replication and transcription mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 has recently emerged, their regulation remains unclear.\n\nResultsBased on reanalysis of public data, we propose a negative feedback model to explain the regulation of replication and transcription in--but not limited to--SARS-CoV-2. The key step leading to new discoveries was the identification of the cleavage sites of nsp15--an RNA uridylate-specific endoribonuclease, encoded by CoVs. According to this model, nsp15 regulates the synthesis of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) and genomic RNAs (gRNAs) by cleaving transcription regulatory sequences in the body. The expression level of nsp15 determines the relative proportions of sgRNAs and gRNAs, which in turn change the expression level of nps15 to reach equilibrium between the replication and transcription of CoVs.\n\nConclusionsThe replication and transcription of CoVs are regulated by a negative feedback mechanism that influences the persistence of CoVs in hosts. Our findings enrich fundamental knowledge in the field of gene expression and its regulation, and provide new clues for future studies. One important clue is that nsp15 may be an important and ideal target for the development of drugs (e.g. uridine derivatives) against CoVs.",

We then characterized organoid variability using novel machine learning methods and found that the contribution of donor, clone, and batch is significant and remarkably consistent over gene expression, morphology, and cell-type composition. Next, we performed multi-factorial protocol optimization, producing a directed forebrain protocol compatible with 96-well culture that exhibits low variability while preserving tissue complexity.

    "abstract": "X chromosome inactivation (XCI) mediated by differential DNA methylation between sexes is well characterized in eutherian mammals. Although XCI is shared between eutherians and marsupials, the role of DNA methylation in marsupial XCI remains contested. Here we examine genome-wide signatures of DNA methylation from methylation maps across fives tissues from a male and female koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) and present the first whole genome, multi-tissue marsupial \"methylome atlas.\" Using these novel data, we elucidate divergent versus common features of marsupial and eutherian DNA methylation. First, tissue-specific differential DNA methylation in marsupials primarily occurs in gene bodies. Second, females show significant global reduction (hypomethylation) of X chromosome DNA methylation compared to males. We show that this pattern is also observed in eutherians. Third, on average, promoter DNA methylation shows little difference between male and female koala X chromosomes, a pattern distinct from that of eutherians. Fourth, the sex-specific DNA methylation landscape upstream of Rsx, the primary lncRNA associated with marsupial XCI, is consistent with the epigenetic regulation of female-(and presumably inactive X chromosome-) specific expression. Finally, we utilize the prominent female X chromosome hypomethylation and classify 98 previously unplaced scaffolds as X-linked, contributing an additional 14.6 Mb (21.5 %) to genomic data annotated as the koala X chromosome. Our work demonstrates evolutionarily divergent pathways leading to functionally conserved patterns of XCI in two deep branches of mammals.",

    "abstract": "Several facultative bacterial symbionts of insects protect their hosts against natural enemies. Spiroplasma poulsonii strain sMel, a male-killing heritable symbiont of Drosophila melanogaster, confers protection against some species of parasitic wasps. Several lines of evidence suggest that Spiroplasma-encoded ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs) are involved in the protection mechanism, but the potential contribution of the fly-encoded functions has not been deeply explored. Here we used RNA-seq to evaluate the response of D. melanogaster to infection by Spiroplasma and parasitism by the Spiroplasma-susceptible wasp Leptopilina heterotoma, and the Spiroplasma-resistant wasp Ganaspis hookeri. In the absence of Spiroplasma infection, we found evidence of Drosophila immune activation by G. hookeri, but not by L. heterotoma, which in turn negatively influenced functions associated with male gonad development. As expected for a symbiont that kills males, we detected extensive downregulation in the Spiroplasma-infected treatments of genes known to have male-biased expression. We detected very few genes whose expression was influenced by the Spiroplasma-L. heterotoma interaction, and they do not appear to be related to immune response. For most of them, parasitism by L. heterotoma (in the absence of Spiroplasma) caused an expression change that was at least partly reversed when Spiroplasma was also present. It is unclear whether such genes are involved in the Spiroplasma-mediated mechanism that leads to wasp death or fly rescue. Nonetheless, the expression pattern of some of these genes, which reportedly undergo expression shifts during the larva-to-pupa transition, is suggestive of an influence of Spiroplasma on the development time of L. heterotoma-parasitized flies. In addition, we used the RNAseq data and quantitative (q)PCR to evaluate the transcript levels of the Spiroplasma-encoded RIP genes. One of the five RIP genes (RIP2) was consistently highly expressed independently of wasp parasitism, in two substrains of sMel. Finally, the RNAseq data revealed evidence consistent with RIP-induced damage in the ribosomal (r)RNA of the Spiroplasma-susceptible, but not the Spiroplasma-resistant, wasp. We conclude that immune priming is unlikely to contribute to the Spiroplasma-mediated protection against wasps, and that the mechanism by which G. hookeri resists/tolerates Spiroplasma does not involve inhibition of RIP transcription.",

    "abstract": "Opioids are perhaps the most effective analgesics in medicine. However, from 1999 to 2018, they also killed more than 400,000 people in the United States by suppressing breathing, a common side-effect known as opioid induced respiratory depression. This doubled-edged sword has inspired the dream of developing novel therapeutics that provide opioid-like analgesia without respiratory depression. One such approach has been to develop so-called  biased agonists that activate some, but not all pathways downstream of the {micro}-opioid receptor (MOR), the target of morphine and other opioid analgesics. This hypothesis stems from a study suggesting that MOR-mediated activation of {beta}2-Arrestin is the downstream signaling pathway responsible for respiratory depression, whereas inhibition of adenylyl cyclase produces analgesia. To further verify this model, which represents the motivation for the biased agonist approach, we examined respiratory behavior in mice lacking the gene for {beta}2-Arrestin. Contrary to previous findings, we find no correlation between {beta}2-Arrestin function and opioid-induced respiratory depression, suggesting that any effect of biased agonists must be mediated through an as-yet to be identified signaling mechanism.",

    "abstract": "How bacteria link their rate of growth to the external nutrient conditions is not known. To explore how Bacillus subtilis modulates the rate cells expand their encapsulating cell wall, we compared the single-cell growth rate to the density of moving MreB filaments under different conditions. MreB filament density scales with the growth rate, and is modulated by the mur genes that create the cell wall precursor lipid II. Lipid II is sensed by the serine/threonine kinase PrkC, which, among other proteins, phosphorylates RodZ. Phosphorylated RodZ then increases MreB filament density, increasing growth. Strikingly, increasing the activity of this pathway results in cells elongating far faster than wild type in nutrient-poor media, indicating slow-growing bacteria contain spare growth capacity. Overall, this work reveals that PrkC functions as a cellular rheostat, tuning the activities of cellular processes in response to lipid II, allowing cells to grow robustly across a broad range of nutrient conditions.\n\nOne-sentence summaryThe serine/threonine kinase PrkC modulates both MreB filament density and cellular growth rate by sensing lipid II in Bacillus subtilis.",

    "abstract": "Within the glioblastoma cellular niche, glioma stem cells (GSCs) can give rise to differentiated glioma cells (DGCs) and, when necessary, DGCs can reciprocally give rise to GSCs to maintain the cellular equilibrium necessary for optimal tumor growth. Here, using ribosome profiling, transcriptome and m6A RNA sequencing, we show that GSCs from patients with different subtypes of glioblastoma share a set of transcripts, which exhibit a pattern of m6A loss and increased protein translation during differentiation. The target sequences of a group of miRNAs overlap the canonical RRACH m6A motifs of these transcripts, many of which confer a survival advantage in glioblastoma. Ectopic expression of the RRACH-binding miR-145 induces loss of m6A, formation of FTO/AGO1/ILF3/miR-145 complexes on a clinically relevant tumor suppressor gene (CLIP3) and significant increase in its nascent translation. Inhibition of miR-145 maintains RRACH m6A levels of CLIP3 and inhibits its nascent translation. This study highlights a critical role of miRNAs in assembling complexes for m6A demethylation and induction of protein translation during GSC state transition.\n\nAuthor SummaryCellular plasticity and epigenetic adaptation of human glioblastoma stem cells to the tumor microenvironment is a hallmark of this devastating disease. With our present work, we discover the relationship between miRNAs and the RNA methylation machinery in human glioblastoma and show how miRNA-induced loss of m6A results in increase in protein translation of clinically important transcripts during glioblastoma stem cell differentiation. Leveraging the dynamic functions of these miRNAs can be important in the design of optimal therapeutics targeted at cancer cell plasticity.",

    "abstract": "The structural features of a synapse, in part, determine its output. Synapses are extremely small and tightly packed with vesicles and other organelles. Visualizing synaptic structure requires imaging by electron microscopy, and the features in micrographs must be quantified using morphometry. Three parameters are typically assessed from each specimen: 1) the sizes of individual vesicles and organelles, 2) the absolute number and densities of organelles, and 3) distances between organelles and key features at synapses such as active zone membranes and dense projections. For data to be valid, the analysis must be repeated from hundreds or thousands of images from several biological replicates, a daunting task. Here we report a custom computer program to analyze these features: SynapsEM. In short, we developed macros for ImageJ/Fiji to record x,y-coordinates of segmented structures; the coordinates are then exported as text files. Independent investigators can reload the images and text files to confirm or re-evaluate the segmentation using ImageJ. The Matlab program calculates and reports key synaptic parameters from the coordinates. Since the values are calculated, rather than measured from each micrograph, other parameters can be extracted in Matlab by additional scripting. Thus, this program can accelerate morphometry of synapses and promote a more comprehensive analysis of synaptic ultrastructure.",

The developmental programs guiding placement of neurites in specific layers, and hence their incorporation into specific circuits, are not well understood. We implement novel imaging methods and quantitative models to document the embryonic development of the C. elegans brain neuropil, and discover that differential adhesion mechanisms control precise placement of single neurites onto specific layers. Differential adhesion is orchestrated via developmentally-regulated expression of the IgCAM SYG-1, and its partner ligand SYG-2. Changes in SYG-1 expression across neuropil layers result in changes in adhesive forces, which sort SYG-2-expressing neurons. Sorting to layers occurs, not via outgrowth from the neurite tip, but via an alternate mechanism of retrograde zippering, involving interactions between neurite shafts. Our study indicates that biophysical principles from differential adhesion govern neurite placement and synaptic specificity in vivo in developing neuropil bundles.",

    "abstract": "The sub-cellular positioning of endolysosomes is crucial for regulating their function. Particularly, the positioning of endolysosomes between the cell periphery versus the peri-nuclear region impacts autophagy, mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) signaling and other processes. The mechanisms that regulate the positioning of endolysosomes at these two locations are still being uncovered. Here, using super-resolution microscopy, we show that the retrograde motor dynein forms nano-clusters on endolysosomal membranes containing 1-2 dyneins, with an average of ~3 nanoclusters per endolysosome. These data suggest that a very small number of dynein motors (1-6) drive endolysosome motility. Surprisingly, dynein nano-clusters are slightly larger on peripheral endolysosomes having higher cholesterol levels compared to peri-nuclear ones. By perturbing endolysosomal membrane cholesterol levels, we show that dynein copy number within nano-clusters is influenced by the amount of endolysosomal cholesterol while the total number of nano-clusters per endolysosome is independent of cholesterol. Finally, we show that the dynein adapter protein ORP1L (Oxysterol Binding Protein Homologue) regulates the number of dynein motors within nano-clusters in response to cholesterol levels. We propose a new model by which endolysosomal transport and positioning is influenced by the cholesterol sensing adapter protein ORP1L, which influences dyneins copy number within nano-clusters.",

    "abstract": "Recombination has been shown to contribute to HIV-1 evolution in vivo, but the underlying dynamics are extremely complex, depending on the nature of the fitness landscapes and of epistatic interactions. A less well-studied determinant of recombinant evolution is the mode of virus transmission in the cell population. HIV-1 can spread by free virus transmission, resulting largely in singly infected cells, and also by direct cell-to-cell transmission, resulting in the simultaneous infection of cells with multiple viruses. We investigate the contribution of these two transmission pathways to recombinant evolution, by applying mathematical models to in vitro experimental data on the growth of fluorescent reporter viruses under static conditions (where both transmission pathways operate), and under gentle shaking conditions, where cell-to-cell transmission is largely inhibited. The parameterized mathematical models are then used to extrapolate the viral evolutionary dynamics beyond the experimental settings. Assuming a fixed basic reproductive ratio of the virus (independent of transmission pathway), we find that recombinant evolution is fastest if virus spread is driven only by cell-to-cell transmission, and slows down if both transmission pathways operate. Recombinant evolution is slowest if all virus spread occurs through free virus transmission. This is due to cell-to-cell transmission (i) increasing infection multiplicity, (ii) promoting the co-transmission of different virus strains from cell to cell, and (iii) increasing the rate at which point mutations are generated as a result of more reverse transcription events. This work further resulted in the estimation of various parameters that characterize these evolutionary processes. For example, we estimate that during cell-to-cell transmission, an average of 3 viruses successfully integrated into the target cell, which can significantly raise the infection multiplicity compared to free virus transmission. In general, our study points towards the importance of infection multiplicity and cell-to-cell transmission for HIV-evolution.",

Pharmacogenomics aims to understand how genetic variation influences drug response and develop clinical guidelines to aid clinicians in personalized treatment decisions informed by genetics. Although pharmacogenomics has not been broadly adopted into clinical practice, genetics influences treatment decisions regardless. Physicians adjust patient care based on observed response to medication, which may occur as a result of genetic variants harbored by the patient. Here we seek to understand the genetics of drug selection in statin therapy, a class of drugs widely used for high cholesterol treatment. Genetics are known to play an important role in statin efficacy and toxicity, leading to significant changes in patient outcome. We performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on statin selection among 59,198 participants in the UK Biobank and found that variants known to influence statin efficacy are significantly associated with statin selection. Specifically, we find that carriers of variants in APOE and LPA that are known to decrease efficacy of treatment are more likely to be on atorvastatin, a stronger statin. Additionally, carriers of the APOE and LPA variants are more likely to be on a higher intensity dose (a dose that reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by greater than 40%) of atorvastatin than non-carriers (APOE: p(high intensity) = 0.16, OR = 1.7, P = 1.64 x 10-4, LPA: p(high intensity) = 0.17, OR = 1.4, P = 1.14 x 10-2).

    "abstract": "Our perception of the world around us is inherently multisensory, and integrating sensory information from multiple modalities leads to more precise and efficient perception and behaviour. Determining which sensory information from different modalities should be perceptually bound is a key component of multisensory integration. To accomplish this feat, our sensory systems rely on both low-level stimulus features, as well as multisensory associations learned throughout development based on the statistics of our environment. The present study explored the relationship between multisensory associative learning and multisensory integration using encephalography (EEG) and behavioural measures. Sixty-one participants completed a three-phase study. First, participants were exposed to novel pairings audiovisual shape-tone pairings with frequent and infrequent stimulus pairings and complete a target detection task. EEG recordings of the mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3 were calculated as neural indices of multisensory associative learning. Next, the same learned stimulus pairs presented in audiovisual as well as unisensory auditory and visual modalities while both early (<120 ms) and late neural indices of multisensory integration were recorded. Finally, participants completed an analogous behavioural speeded-response task, with behavioural indices of multisensory gain calculated using the race model. Significant relationships were found in fronto-central and occipital areas between neural measures of associative learning and both early and late indices of multisensory integration in frontal and centro-parietal areas, respectively. Participants who showed stronger indices of associative learning also exhibited stronger indices of multisensory integration of the stimuli they learned to associate. Furthermore, a significant relationship was found between neural index of early multisensory integration and behavioural indices of multisensory gain. These results provide insight into the neural underpinnings of how higher-order processes such as associative learning guide multisensory integration.",

Here we address what the requirements are that ensure the continuous formation of a narrow symmetrical tube from an initially asymmetrical primordium whilst overall tissue geometry is constantly changing. We are using live-imaging and quantitative methods to compare wild-type and mutants that either show disrupted cell behaviours or an initial symmetrical placode organisation, with both resulting in severe impairment of the invagination. We find that early transcriptional patterning of key morphogenetic transcription factors drives the selective activation of downstream morphogenetic modules, such as GPCR signalling that activates apical-medial actomyosin activity to drive cell wedging at the future asymmetrically-placed invagination point. Over time, transcription of key factors expands across the rest of the placode and cells switch their behaviour from predominantly intercalating to predominantly apically constricting as their position approaches the invagination pit. Misplacement or enlargement of the initial invagination pit leads to early problems in cell behaviours that eventually result in a defective organ shape. Our work illustrates that the dynamic patterning of the expression of transcription factors and downstream morphogenetic effectors ensures positionally fixed areas of cell behaviour with regards to the invagination point. This patterning in combination with the asymmetric geometrical set-up ensures functional organ formation.",

    "abstract": "FOXA pioneer transcription factors (TFs) displace nucleosomes and prime chromatin across enhancers of different endodermal organs in multipotent precursors before lineage induction. Here, we examined patterns and mechanisms of FOXA target site engagement using human pluripotent stem cell models of endodermal organ development. Unexpectedly, we find that only a subset of pancreatic, hepatic, and alveolar enhancers are FOXA-primed, whereas the majority are unprimed and engage FOXA only upon lineage induction. Analysis of sequence architecture revealed more abundant and stronger FOXA motifs at primed than unprimed enhancers and enrichment for lineage-specific TF motifs at unprimed enhancers. We show that FOXA recruitment to unprimed enhancers specifically depends on lineage-specific TFs, suggesting that regulatory DNA sequence logic governs temporal FOXA recruitment. Our findings suggest that FOXA-mediated enhancer priming broadly facilitates initiation of organ lineage programs, while secondary FOXA recruitment by lineage-specific TFs to the majority of enhancers confers organ specificity to gene expression.",

Non-human primates are a key pre-clinical animal model for human vaccine development, allowing both lymph node and circulating immune responses to be longitudinally sampled for correlates of vaccine efficacy. However, patterns of vaccine antigen drainage via the lymphatics after intramuscular immunisation can be stochastic, driving uneven deposition between lymphoid sites, and between individual lymph nodes within larger clusters. In order to improve the accurate isolation of antigen-exposed lymph nodes during biopsies and necropsies, we developed and validated a method for co-formulating candidate vaccines with tattoo ink, which allows for direct visual identification of vaccine-draining lymph nodes and evaluation of relevant antigen-specific B and T cell responses by flow cytometry. This approach improves the assessment of vaccine-induced immunity in highly relevant non-human primate models.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotic cells, genomes from incoming DNA viruses mount two opposing reactions, viral gene expression and innate immune response, depending on genome exposure (uncoating) to either RNA-polymerases or DNA sensors. Here we show that adenovirus particles contain a tunable linchpin protein with a dual function: response to host cues for scheduled DNA release into the nucleus, and innate immunity suppression by preventing unscheduled DNA release. Scheduled DNA release required the proteasome and ubiquitination of the viral core protein V. Cells lacking the E3 ligase Mind bomb 1 (Mib1) were resistant to wild-type adenovirus infection. Viruses lacking protein V or bearing non-ubiquitinable protein V, however, readily infected Mib1 knockout cells, yet were less infectious than wild-type virus. Their genomes were poorly imported into the nucleus and remained uncoated in the cytosol, thereby enhancing chemokine and interferon production through the DNA sensor cGAS. Our data uncover how the ubiquitin-proteasome system controls the function of a virion linchpin protein suppressing pathogen-associated molecular patterns and triggers viral DNA uncoating at the nuclear pore complex for nuclear import and infection.",

We further demonstrate the utility of our approach by performing a curated compound screen along with structure-activity profiling of a series of small molecules to identify compounds with antiviral activity. Throughout these studies, we observed concordance between data emerging from this assay and from live virus assays.

While the role of this ORF10 was proposed, there is a growing evidence showing that the ORF10 is not a coding region.\n\nHere, we identified SARS-CoV-2 variants in which the ORF10 gene was prematurely terminated. The disease was not attenuated, and the transmissibility between humans was not hampered. Also in vitro, the strains replicated similarly, as the related viruses with the intact ORF10. Altogether, based on clinical observation and laboratory analyses, it appears that the ORF10 protein is not essential in humans.

Genetic deletion or selective inhibition of TRPC5 channels with small-molecule inhibitors protects podocytes in rodent models of disease, but less is known about the human relevance and translatability of TRPC5 inhibition. Here, we investigate the effect of TRPC5 inhibition in puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-treated human iPSC-derived podocytes and kidney organoids. We first established that systemic administration of the TRPC5-specific blocker AC1903 was sufficient to protect podocyte cytoskeletal proteins and suppress proteinuria in PAN-induced nephrosis in rats, an established model of podocyte injury and progressive kidney disease. PAN treatment also triggered the Rac1-TRPC5 injury pathway in human iPSC-derived podocytes and kidney organoids. TRPC5 current was recorded in human iPSC-derived podocytes, and was blocked by AC1903. The TRPC5 blocker also reversed the effects of PAN-induced injury in human podocytes in both 2D and 3D culture systems. Taken together, these results revealed the relevance of the TRPC5-Rac1 pathway in human kidney tissue highlighting the potential of this therapeutic strategy for patients.",

    "abstract": "The human placenta is increasingly a focus of research related to early child development and the impact of maternal hyperimmune states. The ability to model human trophectoderm disease states from human pluripotent stem cells, the nature of human pluripotent stem cell potency and the mechanisms regulating human trophectoderm specification remains poorly understood. Recent work suggests that only the naive state can give rise to trophectoderm and that primed iPSC generate mixed amnionic and mesoderm lineages. Here we identify conditions that efficiently drive the specification of primed iPSC to trophectoderm, named Trophoblast Stem Cell (TSC). iPS-derived-TSC share transcriptional, morphological and functional characteristics with human in vivo cytotrophoblasts including activation of human endogenous retroviruses, expression of COVID-19 associated host factors and generation of multinucleated syncytiotrophoblasts with a large fusion index. At high densities in 5% O2, iPS-derived-TSC form villi-like structures and express extravillous and syncytiotrophoblast proteins HCG-{beta} and HLA-G. Using temporal single cell RNAseq, we define the molecular changes associated with specification under three separate conditions: 1) BMP4, 2) BMP4 and inhibition of WNT, 3) activation of EGF and WNT, inhibition of TGFbeta, HDAC and ROCK signaling (named TSC). With 9,821 high-quality single cell transcriptomes, we find that BMP4 gives rise to mesenchymal cells while TS conditions lacking exogenous BMP4 generate a stable proliferating cell type that is highly similar to six week placenta cytotrophoblasts. TFAP2A programs the specification of primed iPS cells to TSC without transitioning through a naive state. TSC specification independent of exogenous BMP4 will allow for robust and reproducible studies of the cytotrophoblast component of human placenta.",

We identified 56 genotypes, with an average of 2.7 genotypes per host.

Immigration events accounted for three-quarters of the diversity within our study population, while one-quarter of variants appeared to have arisen from within-host evolution. Several study strains were closely related to isolates that caused disease in humans or originated from livestock. Our results suggest that within-host evolution plays a minor role in the generation of diversity than independent immigration and the establishment of strains among our study population.

    "abstract": "BackgroundCardiac glycosides are known to fatally inhibit the Na,K-ATPase throughout the animal kingdom. Several animals, however, evolved target-site insensitivity by substitutions in the otherwise highly conserved cardiac glycoside binding pocket located on the Na,K-ATPase -subunit. The minimal functional enzyme consist of an - and a {beta}-subunit, the latter considered mainly as a chaperone responsible for correct folding and membrane integration. We here analyze resistance to cardiac glycosides and kinetic properties of different Na,K-ATPase /{beta}-combinations of the large milkweed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus. These insects have adapted to high concentrations of cardiac glycosides in their food plants via several rounds of Na,K-ATPase gene duplications followed by differential resistance conferring substitutions and subfunctionalization of the enzymes.\n\nResultsTo investigate their characteristics we expressed nine combinations of O. fasciatus Na,K-ATPase /{beta}-sunbunits (three each) in Sf9 cells and tested them with two structurally distinct cardiac glycosides, calotropin, a host plant compound, and ouabain, a commonly used toxin. Differences in the number and identity of amino acid substitutions in the cardiac glycoside binding site resulted in large differences in activity and toxin resistance of the three -subunits. The enzymes kinetics were also influenced by the {beta}-subunits leading to increased activities (C{beta}3) or altered resistances. The host plant toxin calotropin proved to be a much more potent inhibitor than ouabain for the phylogenetically oldest C based enzymes. This effect was compensated for in the B and A based enzymes with A{beta}1 having higher resistance against calotropin than against ouabain.\n\nConclusionThe originally higher inhibitory potency of the host compound calotropin supports a coevolutionary escalation of plant defenses and herbivore tolerance mechanisms. For the bugs the possession of multiple paralogs improved adaptation to plant toxins in a stepwise manner and mitigates pleiotropic effects by a compromise between ion pumping activity and resistance.",

    "abstract": "In 2020 the world faced the pandemic of COVID-19 - severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by a new type of coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. To stop the spread of the disease, it is crucial to create molecular tools allowing to investigate, diagnose and treat COVID-19. One of such tools are monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). In this study we describe the development of hybridoma cells that can produce mouse mAbs against receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. These mAbs are able to specifically detect native and denaturized S protein in all tested applications including immunoblotting, immunofluorescence staining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, we showed that the obtained mAbs decreased infection rate of human cells by SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particles in in vitro experiments. Finally, we determined the amino acid sequence of light and heavy chains of the mAbs. This information will allow to use the corresponding peptides to establish genetically engineered therapeutic antibodies. To date multiple mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 proteins have been established, however due to the restrictions caused by pandemic, it is imperative to have a local source of the antibodies suitable for researches and diagnostics of COVID-19. Moreover, as each mAb has a unique binding sequence, bigger sets of various antibodies will allow to detect SARS-CoV-2 proteins even if the virus acquires novel mutations.",

    "abstract": "The foundational paradigm of protein folding is that the primary sequence of a protein contains all the information needed for it to adopt a specific native structure1,2. This remarkable property is explained by Anfinsens thermodynamic hypothesis3,4, which asserts that because native states minimize the Gibbs free energy of a protein molecule under physiological conditions, proteins can reliably navigate to their native structures and remain in those states by ergodically sampling their free energy landscapes5. Most experiments of protein folding - conducted on purified, small, single-domain soluble proteins - follow the proportion of protein molecules that are folded as a function of time, temperature, denaturant concentration, or sequence6-8, and have yielded immense insight into the molecular determinants that underpin stable globular folds9,10. However, our reliance on the thermodynamic hypothesis as a ground truth to interpret these experiments has limited our ability to study the folding of complex proteins or to consider alternative non-thermodynamic scenarios11,12. Here, we introduce an experimental approach to probe protein refolding for whole proteomes. We accomplish this by first unfolding and refolding E. coli lysates, and then interrogating the resulting protein structures using a permissive protease that preferentially cleaves at flexible regions. Using mass spectrometry, we analyze the digestion patterns to globally assess structural differences between native and  refolded proteins. These studies reveal that following denaturation, many proteins are incapable of navigating back to their native structures. Our results signal a pervasive role for co-translational folding in shaping protein biogenesis, and suggest that the apparent stability of many native states derive from kinetic persistence rather than thermodynamic stability.",

To achieve this, we develop a variant of our recently proposed hidden Markov jump process (HMJP) with which we learn transition kinetics from parallel measurements in donor and acceptor channels. Our HMJP generalizes the hidden Markov model (HMM) paradigm in two critical ways: (1) it deals with physical smFRET systems as they switch between conformational states in continuous time; (2) it estimates the transition rates between conformational states directly without having recourse to transition probabilities or assuming slow dynamics (as is necessary of the HMM). Our continuous time treatment learns transition kinetics and photon emission rates for dynamical regimes inaccessible to the HMM which treats system kinetics in discrete time. We validate the robustness of our framework on simulated data and demonstrate its performance on experimental data from FRET labeled Holliday junctions.",

IVIM analysis was performed with full-fitting and segmented-fitting, and with threshold b-value of 60 or 200 s/mm2, and fitting started from b=2 s/mm2. 32 men (age range: 25-71 years) and 26 men (age: 22-69 years) had DDVD and IVIM analysis respectively, while 36 women (age: 20-71 years) had DDVD and IVIM analysis.\n\nResultsDDVD had an age-related reduction noted for women. IVIM results of full fitting had good agreement with segmented fitting with threshold b of 60 s/mm2 results, but less so with results of threshold b of 200 s/mm2. As age increases, female subjects Dslow measure had significant reduction, and PF and Dfast measure had significant increase. For the age group of 40-55 years, DDVD, Dslow, PF, and Dfast were 12.27{+/-}3.90, 1.072{+/-}0.067 (10-3mm2/s), 0.141{+/-}0.025, 61.0{+/-}14.0 (10-3mm2/s), and 13.4{+/-}3.6, 1.069{+/-}0.074 mm2/s, 0.119{+/-}0.014, 57.1{+/-}13.2 mm2/s, for men and women, respectively.\n\nConclusionDDVD measure suggest that aging may be associated with reduction in liver perfusion. Lower Dslow measurement can lead to artificial higher PF and Dfast measurement, providing the evidence of IVIM modeling of perfusion component is constrained by diffusion component.",

    "abstract": "Nearly half of the prostate cancer (PCa) cases show elevated levels of ERG oncoprotein due to TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion. Here, we demonstrate ERG mediated upregulation of Distal-less homeobox-1 (DLX1), an established PCa biomarker. Using series of functional assays, we show DLX1 elicits oncogenic properties in prostate epithelial cells, and abrogating its function leads to reduced tumor burden in mouse xenografts. Clinically, [~]60% of the PCa patients exhibit high DLX1 levels, while [~]50% of these cases also harbor elevated ERG associated with aggressive disease and poor survival probability. Mechanistically, we show that ERG gets recruited onto DLX1 promoter and interacts with its enhancer-bound androgen receptor (AR) and FOXA1 to regulate DLX1 expression in TMPRSS2-ERG positive cases. Alternatively, in ERG-negative cases, DLX1 is regulated by AR/AR-V7 and FOXA1. Importantly, BET bromodomain inhibitors disrupt the transcriptional regulators of DLX1 and its associated oncogenic properties, signifying their efficacy in treatment of DLX1-positive PCa patients.",

    "abstract": "The stomatal-aperture is imperative for plant physiological metabolism. The function of polyamines (PAs) in stomatal regulation under stress environment largely remains elucidate. Herein, we investigated the regulatory mechanism of exogenous putrescine (Put) on the stomatal opening of cucumber leaves under salt stress. The results revealed that Put relieved the salt-induced photosynthetic inhibition of cucumber leaves by regulating stomatal-apertures. Put application increased hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and decreased abscisic acid (ABA) content in leaves under salt stress. The inhibitors of diamine oxidase (DAO), polyamine oxidase (PAO), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NADPH) are AG, 1,8-DO and DPI, respectively and pre-treatment with these inhibitors up-regulated key gene NCED of ABA synthase and down-regulated key gene GSHS of reduced glutathione (GSH) synthase. The content of H2O2 and GSH were decreased and ABA content was increased and its influenced trend is AG>1,8-DO>DPI. Moreover, the Put induced down-regulation of ABA content under salt stress blocked by treatment with H2O2 scavenger (DMTU) and GSH scavenger (CNDB). Additionally, the application of DMTU also blocked the increase of GSH content. Collectively, these results suggest that Put can regulate GSH content by promoting H2O2 generation through polyamine metabolic pathway, which inhibits ABA accumulation to achieve stomatal regulation under salt stress.\n\nHighlightExogenous putrescine alleviates photosynthesis inhibition in salt-stressed cucumber seedlings by regulating stomatal-aperture.",

    "abstract": "Phosphorus (P) is an essential plant nutrient and regular applications are essential in most farming systems to maintain high yields. Yet the P fertilizers applied to crops and pastures are derived from non-renewable resources. It is therefore important to find agronomic and genetic strategies for using this resource efficiently, especially since only a proportion of the applied P is absorbed by crops. The aim of this study was to identify Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) for P use efficiency (PUE) in wheat using a Multiparent Advanced Generation InterCross (MAGIC) population grown in the field. The 357 genotypes were arranged in paired plots with and without P fertilization. Yield and biomass were measured and PUE was calculated as either the performance of the genotype relative to the average response to fertilization, or the performance of the genotype relative to the average resilience in the absence of fertilization. Five trials were conducted over three years in Australia at three sites with contrasting clay and sandy soil types.\n\nGenotypic variation for response and resilience were identified in all trials with moderate to strong correlation with productivity with and without P between trials. Multiparent Whole Genome Average Interval Mapping (WGAIM) QTL analyses were conducted on the four traits (Biomass / Yield x P Response / Resilience) across the five trials and identified 130 QTL in total. QTL within 10 cM of each other were clustered into 56 groups that were likely to represent identical or linked loci. Of the clusters 27 (48%) contained only a single QTL but 17 (31%) contained 3 or more in different trials or traits. This suggests multiple biological mechanisms driving PUE in different environments. Eight of the 56 groups collocated with QTL for seedling root hair length identified in the same MAGIC population in an earlier study.\n\nHighlightIdentification of genetic loci for phosphorus use efficiency in a multigenic population of Australian wheats grown on contrasting soils.",

This study reports the effects of season-long interference of several feral radish densities on grain yield and yield components of oilseed rape, wheat and sunflower, and on feral radish traits under field conditions. Feral radish density treatments consisted of 0, 2, 4, 8 and 16 plants m-2 in oilseed rape, 0, 4 and 12 plants m-2 in wheat, and 0, 1.6, 4, 8 and 16 plants m-2 in sunflower. The number of inflorescences per area, seeds per inflorescence and the seed biomass of crops were reduced with increasing feral radish densities. The rectangular hyperbola model revealed yield losses by up to 100 %, 74.4 % and 12.2 % in oilseed rape, wheat and sunflower, respectively. Feral radish seed production ranged from 4,300 to 31,200, and 1000 to 4,700 seeds m-2 in winter crops and sunflower, respectively. Season-long feral radish interference can result in serious economic losses in oilseed rape, wheat and sunflower. The adverse impact of feral radish on the yield of winter and summer crops and the high feral radish seed and pods production suggests the need for the development and implementation of diverse and effective long-term weed management practices.",

    "abstract": "The worldwide SARS-CoV-2 outbreak poses a serious challenge to human societies and economies. SARS-CoV-2 proteins orchestrate complex pathogenic mechanisms that underlie COVID-19 disease. Thus, understanding how viral polypeptides rewire host protein networks enables better-founded therapeutic research. In complement to existing proteomic studies, in this study we define the first proximal interaction network of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, at the whole proteome level in human cells. Applying a proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID)-based approach greatly expanded the current knowledge by detecting interactions within poorly soluble compartments, transient, and/or of weak affinity in living cells. Our BioID study was complemented by a stringent filtering and uncovered 2,128 unique cellular targets (1,717 not previously associated with SARS-CoV-1 or 2 proteins) connected to the N- and C-ter BioID-tagged 28 SARS-CoV-2 proteins by a total of 5,415 (5,236 new) proximal interactions. In order to facilitate data exploitation, an innovative interactive 3D web interface was developed to allow customized analysis and exploration of the landscape of interactions (accessible at http://www.sars-cov-2-interactome.org/). Interestingly, 342 membrane proteins including interferon and interleukin pathways factors, were associated with specific viral proteins. We uncovered ORF7a and ORF7b protein proximal partners that could be related to anosmia and ageusia symptoms. Moreover, comparing proximal interactomes in basal and infection-mimicking conditions (poly(I:C) treatment) allowed us to detect novel links with major antiviral response pathway components, such as ORF9b with MAVS and ISG20; N with PKR and TARB2; NSP2 with RIG-I and STAT1; NSP16 with PARP9-DTX3L. Altogether, our study provides an unprecedented comprehensive resource for understanding how SARS-CoV-2 proteins orchestrate host proteome remodeling and innate immune response evasion, which can inform development of targeted therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "As natural disasters increase in frequency and severity1, 2, mounting evidence reveals that their human toll extends beyond death, injury, and loss. Posttraumatic stress (PTS) can be common among directly exposed individuals, and children are particularly vulnerable3, 4. Curiously, PTS can even be found among youth far removed from harms way, and media-based exposure may partially account for this phenomenon5-8. Unfortunately, susceptibility to media effects has been difficult to characterize because most research is initiated post-event, precluding examination of pre-disaster factors. In this study, we mitigate this issue with data from nearly 400 9-to 11-year-old children collected prior to and after Hurricane Irma. We evaluate whether preexisting neural patterns moderate associations between hurricane experiences and later Irma-related PTS. We show that \"dose\" of both objective exposure and Irma-related media exposure predicted Irma-related PTS, the latter even among children dwelling thousands of kilometers away from the hurricane. Furthermore, we show, using pre-hurricane functional magnetic resonance imaging data, that neural responses in brain regions associated with anxiety and stress confer particular vulnerability to the psychological effects of hurricane exposure among certain children. Surprisingly, this was even the case for media exposure- we found that that right amygdala reactivity to fearful stimuli moderated the association between Irma-related media exposure and PTS symptoms, with the media-PTS association strongest for children showing pre-hurricane heightened amygdala reactivity to Fear vs Neutral Faces. In contrast, in bilateral orbitofrontal cortex and left parahippocampal gyrus, children showing a weak response to the Fear condition relative to the Neutral condition were especially susceptible to PTS as a result of Irma-related media exposure. Collectively, these findings run counter to outdated \"bullseye\" models of disaster exposure that assume negative effects are narrowly circumscribed around a disasters geographic epicenter9. In contrast, for some youth with measurable preexisting vulnerability, consumption of extensive disaster-related media appears to offer an alternative pathway to disaster exposure that transcends geography and objective risk. This preventable exposure should be considered in disaster-related mental health efforts.",

    "abstract": "Previous mathematical models developed to optimize the degree of novelty in product design have represented novelty by emotional dimensions such as arousal (surprise) and valence (positivity and negativity). Formalizing arousal as Bayesian information gain and valence as a function of arousal based on Berlynes arousal potential theory, the model indicates that novelty becomes acceptable with repeated exposure and changes the preferences of the users. Hence, acceptable novelty transitions are important in the design of long-term product experience. We propose a mathematical model of acceptable novelty transitions with emotional habituation based on the emotional dimension model. We formalized valence as a function of information-theoretic free-energy and expressed free-energy as a function of three parameters: initial prediction error, initial uncertainty, and noise of sensory stimulus. To verify whether the transition speed of acceptable novelty depends on the initial uncertainty in our model, we analysed the responses of participants to historic artworks; we manipulated the uncertainty level by varying the obscurity of the presented pieces and the prediction error by rendering them in different artistic styles. We used the subjective reports of valence in response to the samples as measures of valence levels. The experimental results support our hypothesis.",

We find that 4MU treatment reduces pericellular hyaluronan, destabilizes interactions between DC and T-cells, and prevents T-cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. These effects were observed only when 4MU was added prior to initial antigen presentation but not later, consistent with 4MU-mediated inhibition of de novo antigenic responses. Building on these findings, we find that 4MU delays rejection of allogeneic pancreatic islet transplant and allogeneic cardiac transplants in mice and suppresses allogeneic T-cell activation in human mixed lymphocyte reactions.

In addition, env sequences from long-term infected fetuses were highly divergent and formed separate phylogenetic lineages from their cognate maternal viruses. Host selection sites unique to infant viruses were identified in regions frequently targeted by broadly neutralizing antibodies and T cell immune responses. The identification of unique selection sites in the env gene of fetal viruses indicates that the immune system in fetuses is capable of exerting selection pressure on viral evolution.

    "abstract": "For the yeast population and diversity, marine habitats are the least explored niches and the lack of validated database is considered to be a drawback for yeast research. The aim of the present study is to create a comprehensive DNA barcode library for marine derived yeast species isolated from organic burial hotspots such as coastal sediment in mangrove and continental shelf ecosystems. As we enriched, isolated and ITS gene sequenced 1017 marine derived yeast isolates belonging to 157 marine species in 55 genera, 28 families, 14 orders, 8 classes of 2 Phyla (viz., Ascomycota and Basidiomycota) of which 13 yeast species were first time barcoded. We witnessed yeast species of both terrestrial and marine endemic origin in the barcode datasets. Due to the large volume of sequencing trace files, the variable length of extracted sequences, and the lack of reference sequences in public databases, difficulties were faced in taxonomic sequence validation. The length of the majority of the sequences (99.42%) were more than or equal to 600 base pairs. BLAST analysis revealed that 13 yeast species were barcoded for the first time. The genus, Candida was the speciose genera isolated in this study. K2P intra-species distance analysis performed for selective groups yielded an average of 0.33%, well below the previously proposed yeast barcode gap. ITS gene NJ-tree based identification conducted for selective species in Ascomycota and Basidomycota, precisely clustered the same species into one group, indicating the efficacy of ITS gene in yeast species delineation. Besides isolating some of the common marine yeast species such as Candida oceani, Bandonia marina and Yarrowia lipolytica, we found approximately 60% of the yeast species isolates were previously unrecorded from the marine environment (example; Cystobasidiopsis lactophilus, Slooffia cresolica, Udeniozyma ferulica, Colacogloea falcatus and Pichia guilliermondii), of which 16.5% were recognised as potential human pathogens (example; Candida orthopsilosis, C. rugosa, Debaryomyces fabryi and Yamadazyma triangularis). Apart from releasing the barcode data in GenBank, provisions were made to access the entire dataset along with meta-data in the Barcode of life database (http://dx.doi.org/10.5883/DS-MYIC). This research constitutes the largest dataset to date for collecting marine yeast isolates and their barcodes. As meta- and environmental barcoding analysis were expanding its scope including environmental assessment and monitoring, the datasets such as ours will be more useful.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial systems have gained wide attention for depolymerization of lignocellulosic biomass, due to their high functional diversity and adaptability. To achieve the full microbial exploitation of lignocellulosic residues and the cost-effective production of bioproducts within a biorefinery, multiple metabolic pathways and enzymes of various specificities are required. In this work, highly diverse aerobic, mesophilic bacteria enriched from Keri Lake, a pristine marsh of increased biomass degradation and natural underground oil leaks, were explored for their metabolic versatility and enzymatic potential towards lignocellulosic substrates. A wide diversity of Pseudomonas species were obtained from enrichment cultures where organosolv lignin served as the sole carbon and energy source and were able to assimilate a range of lignin-associated aromatic compounds. Highly complex bacterial consortia were also enriched in cultures with xylan or carboxymethyl cellulose as sole carbon sources, belonging to Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacilli, Sphingobacteriia, and Flavobacteria. Numerous individual isolates could target diverse structural lignocellulose polysaccharides by expressing hydrolytic activities on crystalline or amorphous cellulose and xylan. Specific isolates showed increased potential for growth in lignin hydrolysates prepared from alkali pretreated agricultural wastes. The results suggest that Keri isolates represent a pool of effective lignocellulose degraders with significant potential for industrial applications in a lignocellulose biorefinery.",

    "abstract": "Biochemical reactions typically depend on the concentrations of the molecules involved, and cell survival therefore critically depends on the concentration of proteins. To maintain constant protein concentrations during cell growth, global mRNA and protein synthesis rates are tightly linked to cell volume. While such regulation is appropriate for most proteins, certain cellular structures do not scale with cell volume. The most striking example of this is the genomic DNA, which doubles during the cell cycle and increases with ploidy, but is independent of cell volume.\n\nHere, we show that the amount of histone proteins is coupled to the DNA content, even though mRNA and protein synthesis globally increase with cell volume. As a consequence, and in contrast to the global trend, histone concentrations (i.e. amounts per volume) decrease with cell volume but increase with ploidy. We find that this distinct coordination of histone homeostasis and genome content is already achieved at the transcript level, and is an intrinsic property of histone promoters that does not require direct feedback mechanisms. Mathematical modelling and histone promoter truncations reveal a simple and generalizable mechanism to control the cell volume- and ploidy-dependence of a given gene through the balance of the initiation and elongation rates.",

    "abstract": "Reorganization of microtubules from the centrosome to non-centrosomal subcellular sites is central to cell differentiation. To identify components of non-centrosomal microtubule organizing centers in differentiated cells of a living organism, we developed the biotin ligase-based proximity labeling approach TurboID for use in C. elegans. We identified proteins proximal to the non-centrosomal microtubule minus end protein PTRN-1/Patronin at the apical membrane of epithelial cells, focusing on two conserved proteins: spectraplakin protein VAB-10B and WDR-62, a protein we identify as homologous to vertebrate primary microcephaly disease gene WDR62. We found that WDR-62 and VAB-10B independently regulate the growth and localization of non-centrosomal microtubules and the apical targeting of microtubule minus end proteins. This regulation occurs downstream of cell polarity and in conjunction with actin. Our data suggest a division of labor where microtubule growth and anchoring are regulated by distinct complexes and uncover novel functions of spectraplakins and WDR62 family proteins.",

    "abstract": "Genes with identical DNA sequences may show differential expression because of epigenetic marks. These marks in pathogens are key to their virulence and are being evaluated as targets for medical treatment. Where epigenetic marks were created in response to past conditions (epigenetically inherited), they represent a form of memory, the impact of which has not been considered in the evolution of infectious diseases. We fill this gap by exploring the evolution of virulence in pathogens that inherit epigenetic information on the sex of their previous host. We show that memories of past hosts can also provide clues about the sex of present and future hosts when women and men differ in their immunity to infection and/or their interactions with the sexes. These biological and social differences between the sexes are pervasive in humans. We show that natural selection can favour the evolution of greater virulence in infections originating from one sex. Furthermore, natural selection can favour the evolution of greater virulence in infections across sexes (or within sexes). Our results explain certain patterns of virulence in diseases like measles, chickenpox and polio that have puzzled medical researchers for decades. In particular, they address why girls infected by boys (or boys infected by girls) are more likely to die from the infection than girls infected by girls (or boys infected by boys). We propose epigenetic therapies to treat infections by tampering with the memories of infecting pathogens. Counterintuitively, we predict that successful therapies should target pathogens genes that inhibit virulence, rather than those enhancing virulence. Our findings imply that pathogens can carry memories of past environments other than sex (e.g. those related to socioeconomic status) that may condition their virulence and could signify an important new direction in personalised medicine.",

    "abstract": "Previous work found that the centromeric repeats of the Western European house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus) are composed predominantly of a 120 bp monomer that is shared by the X and autosomes. Polymorphism in length and sequence was also reported. Here I quantified the length and sequence polymorphism of the centromeric repeats found on the X and autosomes. The levels of local and global sequence variation were also compared. I found three length variants: a 64mer, 112mer and 120mer with relative frequencies of 2.4%, 8.6%, and 89%, respectively. There was substantial sequence variation within all three length variants with a rank-order of: 64mer < 120mer < 112mer. The 64mer was never found alone on long Sanger traces, and was arranged predominantly as a 176 bp higher-order repeat composed of a 64/112mer dimer. Reanalysis of archived ChIP-seq reads found that all three length variants were enriched with the foundational centromere protein CENP-A, but the enrichment was far higher for the 120mer. This pattern indicates that only the 120mer contributes substantially to the functional centromeres, i.e., to the kinetochore-binding, centric cores of the centromeric repeat arrays. Despite only moderate sequence divergence among random pairs of 120mers (averaging 5.9%), other measures of sequence diversity were exceptionally high: i) variant richness (numerical diversity) -on average, one new sequence variant was observed every 4th additional monomer randomly sampled (in N = 7.2 x 103 monomers), and ii) variant evenness -all of the nearly 2 x 103 observed sequence variants were at low frequency, with the most common variant having a frequency of only 5.7%. I next used long Sanger trace data from the Mouse Genome Project to assess the pattern of monomer diversity among neighboring 120mers. Unexpectedly, side-by-side monomers were rarely identical in sequence, and sequence divergence between these neighbors was nearly as high as that between random pairs taken from the genome-wide pool of all 120mers. I also used long Sanger traces to determine sequence variation among neighborhoods of 5 contiguous 120 bp monomers. Sequence diversity within these small regions typically spanned most of the entire range of that found genome-wide. Despite high sequence variation within these neighborhoods, the density of monomers with functional binding motifs for CENP-B (i.e., b-boxes with sequence NTTCGNNNNANNCGGGN) was strongly conserved at about 50%. The overarching pattern of monomer structure at the centromeric repeats of this subspecies is: i) high homogeneity in the density CENP-B binding sites, and ii) high heterogeneity in monomer sequence at both local and global levels.",

    "abstract": "Mangroves have among the highest carbon densities of any tropical forest. These \"blue carbon\" ecosystems can store large amounts of carbon for long periods, and their protection reduces greenhouse gas emissions and supports climate change mitigation. The incorporation of mangroves into Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement and their valuation on carbon markets requires predicting how the management of different land-uses can prevent future greenhouse gas emissions and increase CO2 sequestration. Management actions can reduce CO2 emissions and enhance sequestration, but should be guided by predictions of future emissions, not just carbon storage. We project emissions and forgone soil carbon sequestration potential caused by mangrove loss with comprehensive global datasets for carbon stocks, mangrove distribution, deforestation rates, and drivers of land-use change. Emissions from mangrove loss could reach 2,397 Tg CO2eq by the end of the century, or 3,401 Tg CO2eq when considering forgone carbon sequestration. The highest emissions were predicted in southeast and south Asia (West Coral Triangle, Sunda Shelf, and the Bay of Bengal) due to conversion to aquaculture or agriculture, followed by the Caribbean (Tropical Northwest Atlantic) due to clearing and erosion, and the Andaman coast (West Myanmar) and north Brazil due to erosion. Together, these six regions accounted for 90% of the total potential CO2eq future emissions. We highlight hotspots for future emissions and the land-use specfic management actions that could avoid them with appropriate policies and regulation.",

    "abstract": "Tension in actin cytoskeleton regulates many cellular processes and nuclear morphology. Here, we demonstrate a simple computational method for estimating actin cytoskeletal tension from nucleus shape. We first note that mechanics-based modeling defines a relationship among the volume, surface area, and projected area of the nucleus and hence a specific surface in the three-parameter space of the aforementioned geometric quantities. Data of nuclei from multiple cell types lie on such a surface. Furthermore, nuclei from a given cell population lie on a straight line on the surface. The location and orientation of the line varies with cell type. By using a mechanical model, we present two non-dimensional parameters, namely, the flatness and stretch indicators, which serve as curvilinear coordinates on the surface. Flatness indicator defines the extent of nuclear flattening due to actin cytoskeletal tension and the stretch indicator captures the effect of the elastic modulus of the nuclear envelope. We validate our assertions by modulating the actin cytoskeletal tension using three independent mechanisms: (i) direct downregulation by Cytochalasin D, (ii) indirect upregulation using Nocodazole, and (iii) mechanical stimulation by varying substrate stiffness. We also infer that the flatness indicator is equivalent to the ratio of the height to diameter of the nucleus and is related to the Vogel number. By using this geometric insight, we validate the predictions of our model with data from many previous studies. Finally, we present an analytical formula and a correlation for estimating actin cytoskeletal tension from nuclear projected area and volume.",

However, there is increasing evidence that this largely ignored class of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) also have wide-ranging, non-canonical functions in diseases, including cancer. SnoRNAs have been shown to have both oncogenic and tumor suppressor roles, yet whether snoRNAs regulate metastasis is unknown. Here we show that expression of certain snoRNAs are enriched in lymph node (LN) metastases in a micro-surgical, immune-competent mouse model of breast cancer. We identify the snoRNA Snord67 as a key regulator of LN metastasis. Knockout of Snord67 resulted in significantly decreased LN tumor growth and subsequent development of distant metastases. This was associated with loss of targeted 2-O-methylation on the small nuclear RNA U6, a component of the spliceosome. RNA sequencing revealed distinct alternative splicing patterns in Snord67 knockout cells. Using rapid autopsy breast cancer cases, we found that matched human primary tumor and LN metastases revealed similar alternatively spliced genes, including several that are known to contribute to cancer. These results demonstrate that Snord67 is critical for growth of LN metastases and subsequent spread to distant metastases, and suggest that snoRNA-guided modifications of the spliceosome represent a previously unappreciated, yet targetable pathway in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Microbial metabolites produced by the gut microbiome, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), can influence both local intestinal and distant lung physiology and response to injury. However, how lung immune activity is regulated by SCFAs is unknown. We examined fresh human lung tissue and observed the presence of SCFAs with large inter-individual and even intra-lobe variability. In vitro, SCFAs were capable of modifying the metabolic programming in both resting and LPS-exposed alveolar macrophages (AM). Additionally, since we hypothesized that lung immune tone could be defined through priming of the inflammasome (aka signal 1), we interrogated naive mouse lungs for pro-IL-1{beta} message and localized its presence within the alveolar space in situ, specifically in AM subsets, and in close proximity to alveolar type 2 epithelial (AT2) cells. We established that metabolically active gut microbiota, that produce SCFAs, can transmit LPS and SCFAs to the lung (potential sources of signal 1), and thereby could regulate lung immune tone and metabolic programming. To understand how murine lung cells sensed and upregulated IL-1{beta} in response to gut-microbiome factors, we determined that in vitro, AM and AT2 cells expressed SCFA receptors, FFAR2, FFAR3, and IL-1{beta} but with different expression patterns and LPS-inducibility. Finally, we observed that IL-1{beta}, FFAR2 and FFAR3 were expressed both in isolated human AM and AT2 cells ex-vivo, but in fresh human lung sections in situ, only AM expressed IL-1{beta} at rest and after LPS challenge. Together, this translational study using mouse and human lung tissue and cells supports an important role for the gut microbiome and SCFAs in regulating lung immune tone.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAberrant CXCR4/CXCL12 signaling is involved in many pathophysiological processes including chronic inflammatory diseases. Thus, the chemokine receptor CXCR4 is a promising target for the therapy of inflammatory disorders, such as atopic dermatitis or allergic asthma. A natural fragment of serum albumin, named EPI-X4, has previous been identified as endogenous peptide antagonist and inverse agonist of CXCR4. The endogenous CXCR4 antagonist provides a promising basis for the development of improved analogues for the therapy of inflammatory diseases.\n\nObjectiveTo increase the anti-CXCR4 activity of EPI-X4 and to evaluate the therapeutic potential of optimized analogs in mouse models of atopic dermatitis and asthma.\n\nMethodsMolecular docking analysis of the interaction of EPI-X4 with CXCR4 was performed to define critical interaction motifs and to rationally design analogs with increased activity. EPI-X4 derivatives were synthesized and CXCR4 binding and antagonizing activity determined in assays for antibody competition, inhibition of CXCR4-mediated HIV-1 infection, CXCL12-dependent Ca2+ mobilization, ERK and AKT phosphorylation and cell migration. Toxicity of peptides was evaluated in zebrafish embryos. The therapeutic efficacy of the lead peptide EPI-X4 JM#21 was determined in mouse models of atopic dermatitis and asthma.\n\nResultsDocking analysis identified key interaction motifs of EPI-X4/CXCR4. Rational drug design allowed to increase the anti-CXCR4 activity of EPI-X4 and resulted in the generation of the lead analog JM#21, which bound CXCR4 and suppressed CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 infection more efficiently than the clinically approved small molecule CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100. JM#21 did not exert toxic effects in zebrafish embryos and efficiently prevented inflammation of the skin in a mouse model of atopic dermatitis. Moreover, EPI-X4 and its improved derivative suppressed allergen-induced infiltration of eosinophils and other immune cells into the airways of animals in an asthma mouse model.\n\nConclusionThe rationally designed EPI-X4 derivative JM#21 is a potent antagonist of CXCR4 and the first CXCR4 inhibitor with therapeutic efficacy in atopic dermatitis. Further clinical development of this new class of CXCR4 antagonists for the therapy of atopic dermatitis, asthma and other CXCR4-associated diseases is highly warranted.\n\nGraphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "IntroductionSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, remains viable and therefore potentially infectious on several materials. One strategy to discourage the fomite-mediated spread of COVID-19 is the development of materials whose surface chemistry can spontaneously inactivate SARS-CoV-2. Silicon nitride (Si3N4), a material used in spine fusion surgery, is one such candidate because it has been shown to inactivate several bacterial species and viral strains. This study hypothesized that contact with Si3N4 would inactivate SARS-CoV-2, while mammalian cells would remain unaffected.\n\nMaterialsSARS-CoV-2 virions (2x104 PFU/mL diluted in growth media) were exposed to 5, 10, 15, and 20% (w/v) of an aqueous suspension of sintered Si3N4 particles for durations of 1, 5, and 10 minutes, respectively. Before exposure to the virus, cytotoxicity testing of Si3N4 alone was assessed in Vero cells at 24 and 48 hour post-exposure times. Following each exposure to Si3N4, the remaining infectious virus was quantitated by plaque assay.\n\nResultsVero cell viability increased at 5% and 10% (w/v) concentrations of Si3N4 at exposure times up to 10 minutes, and there was only minimal impact on cell health and viability up to 20% (w/v). However, the SARS-CoV-2 titers were markedly reduced when exposed to all concentrations of Si3N4; the reduction in viral titers was between 85% - 99.6%, depending on the dose and duration of exposure.\n\nConclusionsSi3N4 was non-toxic to the Vero cells while showing strong antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. The viricidal effect increased with increasing concentrations of Si3N4 and longer duration of exposure. Surface treatment strategies based on Si3N4 may offer novel methods to discourage SARS-CoV-2 persistence and infectivity on surfaces and discourage the spread of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Heart development in the chicken embryo is regulated by a concert of cardiogenic morphogens and signaling molecules, but the physiological signal molecule nitric oxide(NO) has not been studied in the context of heart formation. A dynamic investigation of endoderm NO formation demonstrates for the first time a correlation with the established development events of the cardiac heart fields and heart tube. Manipulation of endoderm NO signaling demonstrate a role of NO signaling in the differentiation and proliferation of cardiac progenitors for heart tube formation and cardiac heart field development. To investigate NO in the proliferation of myocardial cells in the heart tube embryos, a computer vision based artificial intelligence approach is followed to automate the long and tedious job of counting cells in a large image dataset. We document NO as an important signaling molecule in the regulation of nascent embryonic cardiogenesis whose effects on other early cardiogenic morphogens is unknown.",

    "abstract": "How ecological divergence causes strong reproductive isolation between populations in close geographic contact remains poorly understood at the genomic level. We here study this question in a stickleback population pair adapted to contiguous, ecologically different lake and stream habitats. Dense clinal whole-genome sequence data reveal numerous regions fixed for alternative alleles over a distance of just a few hundred meters. This strong polygenic adaptive divergence must constitute a genome-wide barrier to gene flow because a steep cline in allele frequencies is observed across the entire genome, and because the cline center co-localizes with the habitat transition. Simulations confirm that such strong reproductive isolation can be maintained by polygenic selection despite high dispersal and small per-locus selection coefficients. Finally, comparing samples from the cline center before and after an unusual ecological perturbation demonstrates the fragility of the balance between gene flow and selection. Overall, our study highlights the efficacy of divergent selection in maintaining reproductive isolation without physical isolation, and the analytical power of studying speciation at a fine eco-geographic and genomic scale.",

    "abstract": "Making inferences about the computations performed by neuronal circuits from synapse-level connectivity maps is an emerging opportunity in neuroscience. The mushroom body (MB) is well positioned for developing and testing such an approach due to its conserved neuronal architecture, recently completed dense connectome, and extensive prior experimental studies of its roles in learning, memory and activity regulation. Here we identify new components of the MB circuit in Drosophila, including extensive visual input and MB output neurons (MBONs) with direct connections to descending neurons. We find unexpected structure in sensory inputs, in the transfer of information about different sensory modalities to MBONs, and in the modulation of that transfer by dopaminergic neurons (DANs). We provide insights into the circuitry used to integrate MB outputs, connectivity between the MB and the central complex and inputs to DANs, including feedback from MBONs. Our results provide a foundation for further theoretical and experimental work.",

    "abstract": "Dendritic integration of synaptic inputs entangles their increased electrotonic attenuation at distal dendrites, which can be counterbalanced by the increased synaptic receptor density. However, during sustained network activity the influence of individual synapses depends on their release properties. How these properties are distributed along dendrites remains poorly understood. Here, we employed classical optical quantal analyses and a genetically encoded optical glutamate sensor in acute hippocampal slices to monitor release at CA3-CA1 synapses. We find that their release probability increases with greater distances from the soma. Similar-fidelity synapses tend to group together whereas release probability shows no trends regarding the within-branch position. Simulations with a realistic CA1 pyramidal cell hosting stochastic synapses suggest that the observed trends boost signal transfer fidelity, particularly at higher input frequencies. Because high-frequency bursting has been associated with learning, the release probability pattern we have found may play a key role in memory trace formation.",

    "abstract": "Cellular diversity in multicellular organisms is often generated via asymmetric divisions. In the fly, for example, neural stem cells divide asymmetrically to generate a large self-renewing stem cell and a smaller sibling that differentiates. Efforts to understand how these different cell fates are generated have focused on the asymmetric segregation of cortically-localised transcription factors at division, which preferentially enter single daughter cell nuclei to change their fate. However, we find that the nuclear compartment in these cells remains intact throughout mitosis and is asymmetrically inherited, giving rise to sibling nuclei that differ profoundly in size, envelope composition and fate markers. These data reveal the importance of considering nuclear remodelling during stem cell divisions, and show how daughter cell fates depend on the coordination of the asymmetric inheritance of cortical fate markers with asymmetric nuclear division.",

    "abstract": "To understand why evolution produced the biological systems that exist today, we must know how important chance, contingency, and necessity were during history. Previous observations suggest that each of these modes of causality affects evolution in various settings, but their relative roles and interactions are not well characterized because they have never been systematically assessed in a single system or on a timescale relevant to evolutionary history. To this end, we reconstructed ancestral B-cell-lymphoma-2-family proteins and developed a continuous evolution method to select for defined protein-protein interaction specificities. By repeatedly evolving a series of ancestral proteins to acquire specificities that occurred during history, we show that contingency steadily overwhelms chance and erases necessity as the primary cause of sequence variation in proteins over long phylogenetic timescales. As a result, evolutionary trajectories launched from distant starting points are essentially unpredictable, even under strong and identical selection pressures. Genetic dissection of the outcomes shows that chance arises because numerous sets of mutations can alter specificity at any point in time, while contingency arises because historical substitutions change these sets. Patterns of variation in extant protein sequences are therefore largely the idiosyncratic product of a particular course of unpredictable historical events.",

    "abstract": "Evidence from both model organisms and clinical genetics suggests close coordination between the developing brain and face1-8, but it remains unknown whether this developmental link extends to genetic variation that drives normal-range diversity of face and brain shape. Here, we performed a multivariate genome-wide association study of cortical surface morphology in 19,644 European-ancestry individuals and identified 472 genomic loci influencing brain shape at multiple levels. We discovered a substantial overlap of these brain shape association signals with those linked to facial shape variation, with 76 common to both. These shared loci include transcription factors with cell-intrinsic roles in craniofacial development, as well as members of signaling pathways involved in brain-face crosstalk. Brain shape heritability is equivalently enriched near regulatory regions active in either brain organoids or in facial progenitor cells. However, brain shape association signals shared with face shape are distinct from those shared with behavioral-cognitive traits or neuropsychiatric disorder risk. Together, we uncover common genetic variants and candidate molecular players underlying brain-face interactions. We propose that early in embryogenesis, the face and the brain mutually shape each other through a combination of structural effects and paracrine signaling, but this interplay may have little impact on later brain development associated with cognitive function.",
