    "abstract": "The dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus is fundamental for cognitive flexibility and has the extraordinary ability to generate new neurons throughout life. Recent evidence suggested that adult-born neurons differentially modulate input to the DG during the processing of spatial information and novelty. However, how this differential regulation by neurogenesis is translated into different aspects contributing cognitive flexibility is unclear. Here, we increased adult-born neurons by a genetic expansion of neural stem cells and studied their influence during navigational learning. We found that increased neurogenesis improved memory precision, indexing and retention and that each of these gains was associated with a differential activation of specific DG compartments and better separation of memory representations in the DG-CA3 network. Our results highlight the role of adult-born neurons in promoting memory precision in the infrapyramidal and indexing in the suprapyramidal blade of the DG and together contributing to cognitive flexibility.\n\nOne sentence summaryNeurogenesis improves memory precision and indexing.",

    "abstract": "Successful oculomotor target selection often requires discriminating visual features but it remains contentious whether oculomotor substrates encoding saccade vectors functionally contribute to this process. One possibility is that visual features are discriminated cortically and oculomotor modules select the object with the highest activation in the set of all preprocessed cortical object representations, while an alternative possibility is that oculomotor modules actively discriminate potential targets based on visual features. If the latter view is correct, these modules should not require input from specialized visual cortices encoding the task relevant features. We therefore examined whether the latency of visual onset responses elicited by abrupt distractor onsets is consistent with input from specialized visual cortices by non-invasively measuring human saccade metrics (saccade curvature, endpoint deviations, saccade frequency, error proportion) as a function of distractor processing time for novel, visually complex distractors that had to be discriminated from a target to guide saccades. Visual onset response latencies were ~110 ms, consistent with projections from anterior cortical sites specialized for object processing. Surprisingly, oculomotor visual onset responses encoded features, as we manipulated the visual similarity between targets and distractors and observed an increased visual onset response magnitude and duration when the distractor was highly similar to the target, which was not attributable to an inhibitory processing delay. Visual onset responses were dynamically modulated by executive function, as these responses were anticipatorily extinguished over the time course of the experiment. As expected, the latency of distractor-related inhibition was modulated by the behavioral relevance of the distractor.\n\nSignificance StatementWe provide novel insights into the role of the oculomotor system in saccadic target selection by challenging the convention that neural substrates that encode oculomotor vectors functionally contribute to target discrimination. Our data show that the oculomotor system selects a winner from amongst the preprocessed object representations output from specialized visual cortices as supposed to discriminating visual features locally. We also challenge the convention that oculomotor visual onset responses are feature-invariant, as they encoded task-relevance.",

    "abstract": "ATP and its ionotropic P2X receptors are components of one of the most ancient signaling systems. However, little is known about the distribution and function of purinergic transmission in invertebrates. Here, we cloned, expressed, and pharmacologically characterized P2X receptors in the sea slug Aplysia californica - a prominent model in cellular and system neuroscience. We showed that ATP and P2X receptors are essential signaling components within the unique bioenergetic center located in the CNS of Aplysia, also known as the cerebral F-cluster of insulin-containing neurons. Functional P2X receptors were successfully expressed in Xenopus oocytes to characterize their ATP-dependence (EC50=306M), two-phased kinetics, ion selectivity (Na+-dependence), sensitivity to the ATP analog Bz-ATP (~20% compare to ATP) and antagonists (with PPADS as a more potent inhibitor compared to suramin). Next, using RNA-seq, we characterized the expression of P2X receptors across more than a dozen Aplysia peripheral tissues and developmental stages. We showed that P2X receptors are predominantly expressed in chemosensory structures and during early cleavage stages. The localization and pharmacology of P2X receptors in Aplysia highlight the evolutionary conservation of bioenergetic sensors and chemosensory purinergic transmission across animals. This study also provides a foundation to decipher homeostatic mechanisms in development and neuroendocrine systems.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=124 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/243196v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (47K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d5c2faorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f3dab3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9b49daorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10dc71f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG We show that ATP and its ligand-gated P2X receptors are essential signaling components within both the chemosensory systems and the unique bioenergetic center, present in the CNS of the sea slug Aplysia californica - a prominent model in neuroscience.

Although in theory the marmosets smooth brain allows for broad deployment of powerful tools in primate cortex, in practice marmosets do not typically engage in long experimental sessions akin to rhesus monkeys. This potentially limits their value for detailed, quantitative neurophysiological study. Here we describe chronically-implanted arrays with a 3D arrangement of electrodes yielding stable single and multi-unit responses, and an analytic method for creating \"supersessions\" combining that array data across multiple experiments. We could match units across different recording sessions over several weeks, demonstrating the feasibility of pooling data over sessions.

    "abstract": "BackgroundCa2+-imaging is a powerful tool to measure neuronal dynamics and network activity. To monitor network-level changes in cultured neurons, neuronal activity is often evoked by electrical or optogenetic stimulation and assessed using multi-electrode arrays or sophisticated imaging. Although such approaches allow detailed network analyses, multi-electrode arrays lack single-cell precision, whereas optical physiology generally requires advanced instrumentation.\n\nNew MethodHere we developed a simple, stimulation-free protocol with associated Matlab algorithms that enables scalable analyses of network activity in cultured human and mouse neurons. The approach allows analysis of overall networks and single-neuron dynamics, and is amenable to scale-up for screening purposes.\n\nResultsWe validated the protocol by assessing human neurons with a heterozygous conditional deletion of Munc18-1, and mouse neurons with a homozygous conditional deletion of neurexins. The approach described here enabled identification of differential changes in these mutant neurons at the network level and of the amplitude and frequency of calcium peaks at the single-neuron level. These results demonstrate the utility of the approach.\n\nComparison with existing methodCompared with current imaging platforms, our method is simple, scalable, and easy to implement. It enables quantification of more detailed parameters than multi-electrode arrays, but does not have the resolution and depth of more sophisticated yet labour-intensive analysis methods, such as electrophysiology.\n\nConclusionThis method is scalable for a rapid assessment of neuronal function in culture, and can be applied to both human and mouse neurons. Thus, the method can serve as a basis for phenotypical analysis of mutations and for drug discovery efforts.",

    "abstract": "Neonatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure can cause depressive-like behaviors in rodents involving elevated interferon (IFN)-{gamma}. Studies have linked down-regulation of prefrontal cortex (PFC) ATPase phospholipid transporting 8A2(ATP8A2) expression to depressive-like behaviors. In non-neuronal cells, IFN-{gamma} could reduce ATP8A2 expression. We therefore hypothesized that neonatal LPS exposure might induce PFC ATP8A2 down-regulation by increasing IFN-{gamma} level. Here, C57BL6/J mice of both sexes received 3-dose-injections of LPS (50g/kg bodyweight, i.p.) on postnatal day (PND)5, PND7 and PND9. LPS-treated mice showed a transiently decreased PFC ATP8A2 expression. Moreover, a negative correlation of PFC ATP8A2 expression was found with IFN-{gamma} level. Using neutralizing mAb, IFN-{gamma} was identified as the key mediator of LPS-induced PFC ATP8A2 decrease. Besides, neutralizing IFN-{gamma} during neonatal LPS exposure attenuated the depressive-like behaviors in adulthood. In sum, neonatal LPS exposure reduced ATP8A2 level in PFC in mice via increasing IFN-{gamma} level, maybe associated with mechanism underlying LPS-induced brain and behavior impairments.",

    "abstract": "The human nervous system is one of the most complicated systems in nature. Complex nonlinear behaviours have been shown from the single neuron level to the system level. For decades, linear connectivity analysis methods, such as correlation, coherence and Granger causality, have been extensively used to assess the neural connectivities and input-output interconnections in neural systems. Recent studies indicate that these linear methods can only capture a small amount of neural activities and functional relationships, and therefore cannot describe neural behaviours in a precise or complete way. In this review, we highlight recent advances in nonlinear system identification of neural systems, corresponding time and frequency domain analysis, and novel neural connectivity measures based on nonlinear system identification techniques. We argue that nonlinear modelling and analysis are necessary to study neuronal processing and signal transfer in neural systems quantitatively. These approaches can hopefully provide new insights to advance our understanding of neurophysiological mechanisms underlying neural functions. These nonlinear approaches also have the potential to produce sensitive biomarkers to facilitate the development of precision diagnostic tools for evaluating neurological disorders and the effects of targeted intervention.",

Mutations of ZBTB16 are associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SCZ), but how the function of ZBTB16 is related to ASD or SCZ remains unknown. Here we show the deletion of Zbtb16 in mice leads to both ASD- and SCZ-like behaviors such as social impairment, repetitive behaviors, risk-taking behaviors, and cognitive impairment. To elucidate the mechanism underlying the behavioral phenotypes, we carried out histological studies and observed impairments in thinning of neocortical layer 6 (L6) and a reduction of TBR1+ neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of Zbtb16 KO mice. Furthermore, we found increased dendritic spines and microglia as well as developmental defects in oligodendrocytes and neocortical myelination in the PFC of Zbtb16 KO mice. Using a genomics approach, we identified the Zbtb16-transcriptome that includes genes involved in both ASD and SCZ pathophysiology and neocortical maturation such as neurogenesis and myelination. Co-expression networks further identified Zbtb16-correlated modules that are unique to ASD or SCZ respectively. Our study provides insight into the differential role of ZBTB16 in ASD and SCZ.",

    "abstract": "Examining whether and how the rhythms of limb and breathing movements interact is highly informative about the mechanistic origin of hyperpnoea to exercise. However, studies have failed to reveal regularities. In particular, whether breathing frequency is inherently proportional to limb velocity and/or imposed by a synchronization of breaths to strides is still unclear. Here, we examined the specifications of respiratory changes during running in mice, the premier model for investigating, in a standardized manner, complex integrative tasks including adaptive breathing. We show that respiratory rate increases during running to a fixed and stable value, irrespective of trotting velocities and of inclination. Yet, respiratory rate was further enhanced during gallop. We also demonstrate the absence of temporal coordination of breaths to strides at any speed, intensity or gait. Our work thus highlights a hardwired mechanism that sets respiratory frequency independently of limb movements but in relation with the engaged locomotor program.",

    "abstract": "MotivationDrug repositioning allows expedited discovery of new applications for existing compounds, but re-screening vast compound libraries is often prohibitively expensive. \"Connectivity mapping\" is a process that links drugs to diseases by identifying compounds whose impact on expression in a collection of cells reverses the diseases impact on expression in disease-relevant tissues. The high throughput LINCS project has expanded the universe of compounds and cell types for which data are available, but even with this effort, many potentially clinically useful combinations are missing. To evaluate the possibility of repurposing drugs this way despite missing data, we compared collaborative filtering with either neighborhood-based or SVD imputation methods to two naive approaches via cross-validation.\n\nResultsMethods were evaluated for their ability to predict drug connectivity despite missing data. Predictions improved when cell type was taken into account. Neighborhood-based collaborative filtering was the most successful method, with the best improvements in non-immortalized primary cells. We also explored which classes of compounds are most and least reliant on cell type for accurate imputation, and we identified connections between related compounds even when many were not measured in the relevant cells. We conclude that even for cells in which drug responses have not been fully characterized, it is possible to identify unassayed drugs that reverse in those cells the expression signatures observed in disease.\n\nContactdonna.slonim@tufts.edu",

    "abstract": "One of the worlds most consumed beverages, coffee has its origins as early as the 15th century Ethiopia. Although there are studies on caffeine and other components of coffee such as cafestol and kahweol, up until recently knowledge of the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in coffee was confined to the scientific community and some informed public. It is a general belief that H2O2 is formed only after long periods of storage or with certain roasting practices. The present study is focused on dispelling the myths of H2O2 in coffee. We first measured H2O2 in freshly brewed coffee from different companies using the ferrous oxidation-xylenol orange binding (FOX) assay. Following this, we examined the time-dependent accumulation of H2O2 and its changes with temperature. Further, H2O2 was estimated in coffee obtained from several local vendors. Contrary to the general belief that the accumulation of H2O2 is an aging phenomenon of coffee, we found this toxicant even in freshly brewed coffee. This was true for all brands tested, and the H2O2 content increased upon storage. The highest increase was seen in coffee stored on the hot plate compared to the ones kept at room temperature (22-25 {degrees}C) or in the cold (0-4 {degrees}C). The H2O2 content of coffee from different vendors ranged between 0.29 and 0.82 mM, which is 5- to 20-fold higher than the typical H2O2 concentrations at which significant cytotoxic effects have been reported for assay systems using the human Fanconi deficient (PD20 FANCD2-/-) fibroblasts and other cell types. Our findings are deemed to shine new light on the probable toxic effects of a commonly consumed beverage like coffee, and the time and temperature dependent variations of keeping. While there are documented benefits of consumption of coffee, the possible H2O2-medicated toxic effects are critical and should be considered. Future studies are warranted to delineate the contribution of H2O2 in the healthy wellbeing of individuals who consume coffee extensively.",

BET inhibition, specifically BRD4 blockade, showed anti-fibrotic effects in an animal model of scleroderma and in patient-derived diffuse cutaneous (dc)SSc fibroblasts. Transcriptome analysis of JQ1-treated dcSSc fibroblasts revealed differentially expressed genes related to extracellular matrix, cell cycle, and calcium signaling. The anti-fibrotic effect of BRD4 inhibition was at least in part mediated by downregulation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II  (CaMKII-) and reduction of intracellular calcium concentrations.

    "abstract": "The incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM) is increasing globally and it is a major source of concern. This study was undertaken to assess the antidiabetic effect of the aqueous extract of Moringa oleifera, Ocimum gratissimum and Vernonia amygdalina. Sixty adult Wistar rats with body weight of 120-150 g were randomly assigned to groups of five rats each (n=12). Groups 1 served as normal control; Groups 2-5 were diabetic groups; group 2 served as negative control; group 3-5 received 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg of triherbal formula respectively. The body weight (BW) and fasting blood glucose level (FBSL) of the rats were monitored weekly. At the end of the experiment, all the rats were anaesthetized intraperitoneally (I.P) and blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture for biochemical analysis. There was an increase in the BW of the control group and varying doses of tri-herbal formation. It caused 88.0% decrease in FBSL; 371.7%, 386.6% and 296.0% with respect to 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg. Sub-chronic study of the effect of the extract showed a significant increase (P<0.05) in packed cell volume (PCV), white blood counts in rat induced diabetes. The histological studies showed that the diabetic rats with the architecture of the pancreas distorted, was restored to normal by the extract. Its LD50 was found to be greater than 1000 mg/kg indicating its safety in rats. This study has shown that triherbal formula has hypoglycemic and haematogical effects.",

    "abstract": "The outbreak of COVID-19 has emerged as a global pandemic. The unprecedented scale and severity call for rapid development of effective prophylactics or therapeutics. We here reported Nanobody (Nb) phage display libraries derived from four camels immunized with the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), from which 381 Nbs were identified to recognize SARS-CoV-2-RBD. Furthermore, seven Nbs were shown to block interaction of human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with SARS-CoV-2-RBD-variants, bat-SL-CoV-WIV1-RBD and SARS-CoV-1-RBD. Among the seven candidates, Nb11-59 exhibited the highest activity against authentic SARS-CoV-2 with ND50 of 0.55 g/mL. Nb11-59 can be produced on a large-scale in Pichia pastoris, with 20 g/L titer and 99.36% purity. It also showed good stability profile, and nebulization did not impact its stability. Overall, Nb11-59 might be a promising prophylactic and therapeutic molecule against COVID-19, especially through inhalation delivery.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=154 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/242867v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e4434org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9fee79org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e15bb1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4adb0c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The neonatal heart has been the focus of numerous investigations due to its inherent regenerative potential. However, the interactions between neonatal cardiomyocytes (CMs) and endothelial cells (ECs) have been difficult to model and study due to the lack of an appropriate device. Here, we developed a method to culture primary neonatal CMs and ECs in a microchip and characterise their behavioural properties over a 14-day period. By implementing cell migration analyses coupled with immunostaining and confocal microscopy, we were able to identify and quantify sub-populations of migratory and non-migratory ECs. In CM-EC co-cultures, migrating ECs were found to move in higher numbers and longer distances compared to migrating CMs. In the presence of CMs, non-migrating ECs established connexin gap junctions and formed CM-EC cell aggregates, which were likely a priming event for endothelial organoid formation. This microfluidic device also enabled us to visualise the temporal sequence organoid formation and phenomena such as collective cell migration, CM-EC trans-differentiation and synchronisation of CM beating. This microchip based culture system has potential applications for tissue engineering and drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Brain-controlled neuromodulation therapies have emerged as a promising tool to promote functional recovery in patients with motor disabilities. This neuromodulatory strategy is exploited by brain-machine interfaces and could be used for restoring lower limb muscle activity or alleviating gait deficits. Towards a non-invasive approach for leg neurorehabilitation, we present a set-up that combines acquisition of electroencephalographic (EEG) activity to volitionally control trans-spinal magnetic stimulation (ts-MS). We engineered, for the first time, a non-invasive brain-spine interface (BSI) to contingently connect motor cortical activation during leg motor imagery with the activation of leg muscles via ts-MS. This novel brain-controlled stimulation was validated with 10 healthy participants who underwent one session including different ts-MS conditions. After a short screening of their cortical activation during lower limb motor imagery, the participants used the closed-loop system at different stimulation intensities and scored system usability and comfort. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the developed system to remove online stimulation artifacts from EEG regardless of ts-MS intensity used. All the participants reported absence of pain due to ts-MS and good usability. Our results also revealed that ts-MS controlled afferent and efferent intensity-dependent modulation of the nervous system. The here presented system represents a novel non-invasive means to neuromodulate peripheral nerve activity of lower limb using brain-controlled spinal stimulation.",

    "abstract": "To realize the promise of 3D bioprinting, it is imperative to develop bioinks that possess the biological and rheological characteristics needed for the printing of cell-laden tissue grafts. Alginate is widely used as a bioink because its rheological properties can be modified through pre-crosslinking or the addition of thickening agents to increase printing resolution. However, modification of alginates physicochemical characteristics using common crosslinking agents can affect its cytocompatibility. Therefore, we evaluated the printability, physicochemical properties, and osteogenic potential of four common alginate bioinks: alginate-CaCl2 (alg-CaCl2), alginate-CaSO4 (alg-CaSO4), alginate-gelatin (alg-gel) and alginate-nanocellulose (alg-ncel) for the 3D bioprinting of patient-specific osteogenic grafts. While all bioinks possessed similar viscosity, printing fidelity was lower in the pre-crosslinked bioinks. When used to print geometrically defined constructs, alg-CaSO4 and alg-ncel exhibited higher mechanical properties and lower mesh size than those printed with alg-CaCl2 or alg-gel. The physical properties of these constructs affected the biological performance of encapsulated bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Cell-laden constructs printed using alg-CaSO4 and alg-ncel exhibited greater cell apoptosis and contained fewer living cells 7 days post-printing. In addition, effective cell-matrix interactions were only observed in alg-CaCl2 printed constructs. When cultured in osteogenic media, MSCs in alg-CaCl2 constructs exhibited increased osteogenic differentiation compared to the other three bioinks. This bioink was then used to 3D print anatomically accurate cell-laden scaphoid bones that were capable of partial mineralization after 14 days of in vitro culture. These results highlight the importance of bioink properties to modulate cell behavior and the biofabrication of clinically relevant bone tissues.",

    "abstract": "Foraging is a vital behavioral task for living organisms. Behavioral strategies and abstract mathematical models thereof have been described in detail for various species. To explore the link between underlying neural circuits and computational principles we present how a biologically detailed neural circuit model of the insect mushroom body implements sensory processing, learning and motor control. We focus on cast & surge strategies employed by flying insects when foraging within turbulent odor plumes. Using a spike-based plasticity rule the model rapidly learns to associate individual olfactory sensory cues paired with food in a classical conditioning paradigm. We show that, without retraining, the system dynamically recalls memories to detect relevant cues in complex sensory scenes. Accumulation of this sensory evidence on short time scales generates cast & surge motor commands. Our generic systems approach predicts that population sparseness facilitates learning, while temporal sparseness is required for dynamic memory recall and precise behavioral control. Our work successfully combines biological computational principles with spike-based machine learning. It shows how knowledge transfer from static to arbitrary complex dynamic conditions can be achieved by foraging insects and may serve as inspiration for agent-based machine learning.",

    "abstract": "LAT is a critical regulator of T cell development and function. It organises signalling events at the plasma membrane. However, the mechanism, which controls LAT localisation at the plasma membrane is not fully understood. Here, we studied the impact of helix-breaking amino acids, two prolines and one glycine, in the transmembrane segment on localisation and function of LAT. Using in silico analysis, confocal and superresolution imaging and flow cytometry we demonstrate that central proline residue destabilises transmembrane helix by inducing a kink. The helical structure and dynamics is further regulated by glycine and another proline residue in the luminal part of LAT transmembrane domain. Replacement of these residues with aliphatic amino acids reduces LAT dependence on palmitoylation for sorting to the plasma membrane. However, surface expression of these mutants is not sufficient to recover function of non-palmitoylated LAT in stimulated T cells. These data indicate that geometry and dynamics of LAT transmembrane segment regulate its localisation and function in immune cells.",

    "abstract": "Muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are indispensable for muscle regeneration. A multitude of extracellular stimuli direct MuSC fate decisions from quiescent progenitors to differentiated myocytes. The activity of these signals is modulated by coreceptors such as syndecan-3 (SDC3). We investigated the global landscape of SDC3-mediated regulation of myogenesis using a phosphoproteomics approach which revealed, with the precision level of individual phosphosites, the large-scale extent of SDC3-mediated regulation of signal transduction in MuSCs. We then focused on INSR/AKT/mTOR as a key pathway regulated by SDC3 during myogenesis and mechanistically dissected SDC3-mediated inhibition of insulin signaling in MuSCs. SDC3 interacts with INSR limiting insulin signal transduction via AKT/mTOR. Both knockdown of INSR and inhibition of AKT rescue Sdc3-/- MuSC differentiation to wild type levels. Since SDC3 is rapidly downregulated at the onset of differentiation, our study suggests that SDC3 acts a timekeeper to restrain proliferating MuSC response to insulin and prevent premature differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Since the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus has exhibited remarkable genome stability, but recent emergence of novel variants show virus evolution potential. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 rapidly adapts to Vero E6 cells that leads to loss of furin cleavage motif in spike protein. The adaptation is achieved by asymptotic expansion of minor virus subpopulations to dominant genotype, but wildtype sequence is maintained at low percentage in the virus swarm, and mediate reverse adaptation once the virus is passaged on human lung cells. The Vero E6-adapted virus show defected cell entry in human lung cells and the mutated spike variants cannot be processed by furin or TMPRSS2. However, the mutated S1/S2 site is cleaved by cathepsins with higher efficiency. Our data show that SARS-CoV-2 can rapidly adapt spike protein to available proteases and advocate for deep sequence surveillance to identify virus adaptation potential and novel variant emergence.\n\nSignificance StatementRecently emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants B1.1.1.7 (UK), B.1.351 (South Africa) and B.1.1.248 (Brazil) harbor spike mutation and have been linked to increased virus pathogenesis. The emergence of these novel variants highlight coronavirus adaptation and evolution potential, despite the stable consensus genotype of clinical isolates. We show that subdominant variants maintained in the virus population enable the virus to rapidly adapt upon selection pressure. Although these adaptations lead to genotype change, the change is not absolute and genome with original genotype are maintained in virus swarm. Thus, our results imply that the relative stability of SARS-CoV-2 in numerous independent clinical isolates belies its potential for rapid adaptation to new conditions.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. While much has been learned in the first months of the pandemic, many features of COVID-19 pathogenesis remain to be determined. For example, anosmia is a common presentation and many patients with this finding show no or only minor respiratory signs. Studies in animals experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, provide opportunities to study aspects of the disease not easily investigated in human patients. COVID-19 severity ranges from asymptomatic to lethal. Most experimental infections provide insights into mild disease. Here, using K18-hACE2 mice that we originally developed for SARS studies, we show that infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes severe disease in the lung, and in some mice, the brain. Evidence of thrombosis and vasculitis was detected in mice with severe pneumonia. Further, we show that infusion of convalescent plasma (CP) from a recovered COVID-19 patient provided protection against lethal disease. Mice developed anosmia at early times after infection. Notably, while treatment with CP prevented significant clinical disease, it did not prevent anosmia. Thus K18-hACE2 mice provide a useful model for studying the pathological underpinnings of both mild and lethal COVID-19 and for assessing therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Through routine genomic surveillance of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus (n=229 whole genome sequences), 2 different frameshifting deletions were newly detected in the open reading frame (ORF) 6, starting at the same position (27267). While the 26-nucleotide deletion variant was only found in one sample in March 2020, the 34-nucleotide deletion variant was found within a single geriatric hospital unit in 5/9 patients sequenced and one health care worker with samples collected between April 2nd and 9th, 2020. Both the presence of the 34-nucleotide deletion variant limited to this unit and the clustering of the corresponding whole genome sequences by phylogeny analysis strongly suggested a nosocomial transmission between patients. Interestingly, prolonged viral excretion of the 34-nucleotide deletion variant was identified in a stool sample 14 days after initial diagnosis for one patient. Clinical data revealed no significant difference in disease severity between patients harboring the wild-type or the 34-nucleotide deletion variants. The in vitro infection of the two deletion variants on primate endothelial kidney cells (BGM) and human lung adenocarcinoma cells (Calu-3) yielded comparable replication kinetics with the wild-type strain. Furthermore, high viral loads were found in vivo regardless of the presence or absence of the ORF6 deletion. Our study highlights the transmission and replication capacity of two newly described deletion variants in the same ORF6 region.\n\nImportanceWhile the SARS-CoV-2 genome has remained relatively stable since its emergence in the human population, genomic deletions are an evolutionary pattern previously described for the related SARS-CoV. Real-time genomic monitoring of the circulating variants is paramount to detect strain prevalence and transmission dynamics. Given the role of ORF6 in interferon modulation, further characterization, such as mechanistic interactions and interferon monitoring in patients, is crucial in understanding the viral-host factors driving disease evolution.",

The objective of this study was to supplement the diet of juvenile Atlantic cod with macroalgae and determine the impacts on fish condition and growth, gut morphology and hindgut microbiota composition (16S rRNA amplicon sequencing). Fish were fed one of three diets: control (no macroalgal inclusion), 10% inclusion of either egg wrack (Ascophyllum nodosum) or sea lettuce (Ulva rigida) macroalgae in a 12-week trial.\n\nResultsThe results demonstrated there was no significant difference in fish condition, gut morphology or hindgut microbiota between the U. rigida supplemented fish group and the control group at any time-point. This contrasts with the A. nodosum treatment. Fish within this group were further categorised as either  Normal or  Lower Growth.  Lower Growth individuals found the diet unpalatable resulting in reduced weight and condition factor combined with an altered gut morphology and microbiome relative to the other treatments. Excluding this group, our results show that the hindgut microbiota was largely driven by temporal pressures with the microbial communities becoming more similar over time irrespective of dietary treatment. The core microbiome at the final time-point consisted of the orders Vibrionales (Vibrio and Photobacterium), Bacteroidales (Bacteroidetes and Macellibacteroides) and Clostridiales (Lachnoclostridium).\n\nConclusionsOur study indicates that U. rigida macroalgae can be supplemented at 10% inclusion levels in the diet of juvenile farmed Atlantic cod without any impact on fish condition or hindgut microbial community structure. We also conclude that 10% dietary inclusion of A. nodosum is not a suitable feed supplement in a farmed cod diet.",

    "abstract": "Phages are generally described as species- or even strain-specific viruses, implying an inherent limitation for some to be maintained and spread in diverse bacterial communities. Moreover, phage isolation and host range determination rarely consider the phage ecological context, likely biasing our notion on phage specificity. Here we identified and characterized a novel group of promiscuous phages existing in rivers by using diverse bacteria isolated from the same samples, and then used this biological system to investigate infection dynamics in distantly related hosts. We assembled a diverse collection of over 600 native bacterial strains and used them to isolate six podophages, named Atoyac, from different geographic origin and capable of infecting six genera in the Gammaproteobacteria. Atoyac phage genomes are highly similar to each other but not to those currently available in the genome and metagenome public databases. Detailed comparison of the phages infectivity in diverse hosts and trough hundreds of interactions revealed variation in plating efficiency amongst bacterial genera, implying a cost associated with infection of distant hosts, and between phages, despite their sequence similarity. We show, through experimental evolution in single or alternate hosts of different genera, that plaque production efficiency is highly dynamic and tends towards optimization in hosts rendering low plaque formation. Complex adaptation outcomes observed in the evolution experiments differed between highly similar phages and suggest that propagation in multiple hosts may be key to maintain promiscuity in some viruses. Our study expands our knowledge of the virosphere and uncovers bacteria-phage interactions overlooked in natural systems.\n\nImportanceIn natural environments, phages co-exist and interact with a broad variety of bacteria, posing a conundrum for narrow-host-range phages maintenance in diverse communities. This context is rarely considered in the study of host-phage interactions, typically focused on narrow-host-range viruses and their infectivity in target bacteria isolated from sources distinct to where the phages were retrieved from. By studying phage-host interactions in bacteria and viruses isolated from river microbial communities, we show that novel phages with promiscuous host range encompassing multiple bacterial genera can be found in the environment. Assessment of hundreds of interactions in diverse hosts revealed that similar phages exhibit different infection efficiency and adaptation patterns. Understanding host range is fundamental in our knowledge of bacteria-phage interactions and their impact in microbial communities. The dynamic nature of phage promiscuity revealed in our study has implications in different aspects of phage research such as horizontal gene transfer or phage therapy.",

    "abstract": "Dichloromethane (DCM; CH2Cl2) is a toxic groundwater pollutant that also has a detrimental effect on atmospheric ozone levels. As a dense non-aqueous phase liquid, DCM migrates vertically through groundwater to low redox zones, yet information on anaerobic microbial DCM transformation remains scarce due to a lack of cultured organisms. We report here the characterisation of strain DCMF, the dominant organism in an anaerobic enrichment culture (DFE) that is capable of fermenting DCM to the environmentally benign product acetate. Stable carbon isotope experiments demonstrated that the organism assimilated carbon from DCM and bicarbonate via the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. Strain DCMF is the first anaerobic DCM-degrading bacterium also shown to metabolise non-chlorinated substrates. It appears to be a methylotroph utilising the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway for metabolism of methyl groups from methanol, choline, and glycine betaine, which has implications for the flux of climate-active compounds from subsurface environments. Community profiling and enrichment of the cohabiting taxa in culture DFE to the exclusion of strain DCMF suggest that it is the sole organism in this culture responsible for substrate metabolism, while the cohabitants persist via necromass recycling. Genomic and physiological evidence support placement of strain DCMF in a novel genus,  Candidatus Formamonas warabiya.",

    "abstract": "The prokaryotic adaptive immune system CRISPR/Cas serves as defense against bacteriophage and invasive nucleic acid. A Type I-E CRISPR/Cas system has been detected in classical biotype isolates of Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of the disease cholera. Experimental characterization of this system revealed a functional immune system that operates using a 5-TT-3 protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) for interference. However, several designed spacers against the 5-TT-3 PAM do not interfere as expected, indicating further investigation of this system is necessary. In this study, we identified additional sequence requirements of a pyrimidine in the 5 position of the spacer and purine in the complementary position of the protospacer using 873 unique spacers and 2267 protospacers mined from CRISPR arrays in deposited sequences of V. cholerae. We present bioinformatic evidence that during acquisition the protospacer purine is captured in the prespacer and that a 5-RTT-3 PAM is necessary for spacer acquisition. Finally, we demonstrate experimentally that a 5-RTT-3 PAM is necessary for CRISPR interference by designing and manipulating spacer and cognate PAMs in a plasmid conjugation assay and discover functional consequences of base pairing with the 5 spacer pyrimidine in spacer efficacy.\n\nImportanceBacterial CRISPR/Cas systems provide immunity by defending against phage and other invading elements. A thorough comprehension of the molecular mechanisms employed by these diverse systems will improve our understanding of bacteriophage-bacterial interactions and bacterial adaptation to foreign DNA. The Vibrio cholerae Type I-E system was previously identified in an extinct classical biotype and was partially characterized for its function. Here, using both bioinformatic and functional assays, we extend that initial study. We have found that the Type I-E system still exists in modern strains of V. cholerae. Furthermore, we defined additional sequence elements in both the CRISPR array and in target DNA that are required for immunity. CRISPR/Cas systems are now commonly used as precise and powerful genetic engineering tools. Knowledge of the sequences required for CRISPR/Cas immunity is a prerequisite for the effective design and experimental use of these systems. Our results greatly facilitate the effective use of one such system. Furthermore, we provide a publicly available script that assists in the detection and validation of CRISPR/Cas immunity requirements when such a system exists in any bacterial species.",

These protists are the smallest and least studied microbial eukaryotes but play an important role in functioning of microbial food webs. Using light and electron microscopy, we have studied the diversity of heterotrophic flagellates and centrohelid heliozoans from marine waters of Curacao (The Netherlands Antilles), and provide micrographs and morphological descriptions of observed species. Among 86 flagellates and 3 centrohelids encountered in this survey, five heterotrophic flagellates and one Centrohelid heliozoan were not identified even to the genus. Some flagellate protists have a unique morphology, and may represent undescribed lineages of eukaryotes of high taxonomic rank. The vast majority (89%) of identified flagellates are characterized by wide geographical distribution and had been reported previously from all hemispheres and various climatic regions. More than half of the species were previously observed not only from marine, but also from freshwater habitats. The parameters of the species accumulation curve indicate that our species list obtained for the Curacao study sites is far from complete, and each new sample should yield new species.",

Current gene therapies attempt to either excise HIV-1 provirus or target HIV-1 entry receptors to prevent infection of new cells. Using a viral dynamic model, we determined that combining these two interventions, in the presence or absence of ART, significantly lowers the gene editing efficacy thresholds required to achieve an HIV-1 cure. To implement this dual-targeting approach, we engineered a single lentiviral vector that simultaneously targets multiple highly-conserved regions of the provirus and the host CXCR4 coreceptor, and developed a novel coculture system enabling real-time monitoring of latent infection, viral reactivation, and infection of new target cells. Simultaneous dual-targeting depleted HIV-1-infected cells with significantly greater potency than vectors targeting either virus or host independently, highlighting its potential as an HIV-1 cure strategy.",

    "abstract": "Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) is caused by PirAB toxin-producing Vibrio parahaemolyticus and has devastated the global shrimp aquaculture industry. One approach for preventing growth of AHPND-producing Vibrio spp. is through the application of beneficial bacteria capable of inhibiting these pathogens. In this study we focus on the inhibitory activity of Bacillus subtilis subsp. inaquosorum strain T1, which hinders V. parahaemolyticus growth in co-culture experiments in a density-dependent manner; inhibition was also obtained using cell-free supernatants from T1 stationary phase cultures. Using a mariner-based transposon mutagenesis, 17 mutants were identified having complete or partial loss of inhibitory activity. Of those having total activity loss, 13 had insertions within a 42.6 kb DNA region comprising 15 genes whose deduced products were homologous to non-ribosomal polypeptide synthetases (NRPSs), polyketide synthases (PKSs) and related activities, which were mapped as one transcriptional unit. Mutants with partial activity contained insertions in spo0A and oppA, indicating stationary phase control. Expression of lacZ transcriptional fusions to NRPS and PKS genes was negligible during growth and at their highest during early stationary phase. Inactivation of sigH resulted in loss of inhibitor activity, indicating a role for {sigma}H in transcription. Disruption of abrB resulted in NRPS and PKS gene overexpression during growth as well as enhanced growth inhibition. This is the first study examining expression and control of an NRPS-PKS region unique to the inaquosorum subspecies of B. subtilis and an understanding of factors involved in T1 inhibitor production will enable its development for use as a potential tool against AHPND Vibrio pathogens in shrimp aquaculture.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe shrimp aquaculture industry has been impacted by the rise of acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND), resulting in significant financial losses annually. Caused by strains of the bacterial pathogen, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, treatment of AHPND involves the use of antibiotics, which leads to a rise in antibiotic resistant strains. An alternative approach is through the application of beneficial microorganisms having inhibitory activities against AHPND-generating pathogens. In this study, we examine the genetic basis for the ability of Bacillus subtilis strain T1 to inhibit growth of an AHPND Vibrio strain and show that activity is associated with genes having the potential for synthesizing antibacterial compounds. We found that expression of these genes is under stationary phase control and showed that inactivation of a global transition state regulator results in enhancement of inhibitory activity against the AHPND Vibrio. Our approach for understanding the factors involved in production B. subtilis strain T1 inhibitory activity may allow for development of this strain for use as a potential tool for the prevention of AHPND outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "Gut dysbiosis has been reported repeatedly in Parkinsons disease (PD), but once in rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) from Germany. Abnormal aggregation of -synuclein fibrils causing PD possibly starts from the intestine. RBD patients frequently develop PD. Early-stage gut dysbiosis that is causally associated with PD is thus expected to be observed in RBD. We analyzed gut microbiota in 26 RBD patients and 137 controls by 16S rRNA-seq. Our RBD dataset was meta-analyzed with the German RBD dataset, and was compared with gut microbiota in 223 PD patients. Unsupervised clustering of gut microbiota by LIGER, a topic model-based tool for single-cell RNA-seq analysis, revealed four enterotypes in controls, RBD, and PD. Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria were conserved in an enterotype observed in controls and RBD, whereas they were less in enterotypes observed in PD. Genus Akkermansia and family Akkermansiaceae were consistently increased in both RBD in two countries and PD in five countries. No short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria were significantly changed in RBD in two counties. In contrast, we previously reported that recognized and putative SCFA-producing genera Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, and Lachnospiraceae ND3007 group were consistently decreased in PD in five countries. Increased mucin-layer-degrading genus Akkermansia possibly accounts for the development of RBD, and an additional decrease of SCFA-producing genera is likely to be associated with the transition from RBD to PD.\n\nImportanceNineteen studies have been reported on gut microbiota in PD, whereas only one study has been reported in RBD from Germany. RBD has the highest likelihood ratio to develop PD. Our meta-analysis of RBD in Japan and Germany revealed increased mucin-layer-degrading genus Akkermansia in RBD. Genus Akkermansia may increase the intestinal permeability, as we previously observed in PD patients, and make the intestinal neural plexus exposed to oxidative stress, which can lead to abnormal aggregation of prion-like -synuclein fibrils in the intestine. In contrast to PD, SCFA-producing bacteria were not decreased in RBD. As SCFA induces Treg cells, a decrease of SCFA-producing bacteria may be a prerequisite for the development of PD. We propose that prebiotic and/or probiotic therapeutic strategies to increase the intestinal mucin layer and to increase intestinal SCFA potentially retard the development of RBD and PD.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the conserved bacterial Rcs stress response system mediates corneal pathogenesis associated with Serratia marcescens ocular infections. This was accomplished by modifying Rcs activity using mutant strains. These include a mutant that has a hyper-active Rcs system due to deletion of the IgaA family gene, gumB, and a gumB rcsC double mutant that is defective for Rcs signaling. The role of the Rcs system and bacterial stress response systems for microbial keratitis is not known. Here we observed that the Rcs-activated gumB mutant had a >50-fold reduction in proliferation compared to the wild type within rabbit corneas at 48 h, and demonstrated a notable reduction in inflammation based on inflammatory signs and proinflammatory markers measured at the RNA and protein levels. The gumB mutant phenotypes could be complemented by wild-type gumB on a plasmid and partially complemented by restoration of shlA cytolysin expression and elimination of capsular polysaccharide production. We observed that inactivation of the Rcs stress response system completely restored corneal virulence to the gumB mutant. NanoString transcriptional analysis of bacterial genes expressed during microbial keratitis demonstrated expression of gumB, rcsB, shlA, and three metalloprotease genes. Data suggest that the bacterial capsular polysaccharide is not necessary for infection, but capsule overexpression reduces inflammation. Together, these data indicate that GumB regulates virulence factor production through the Rcs system and this overall stress response system is a key mediator of a bacteriums ability to induce vision-threatening keratitis.",

    "abstract": "Public databases contain a planetary collection of nucleic acid sequences, but their systematic exploration has been inhibited by a lack of efficient methods for searching this corpus, now exceeding multiple petabases and growing exponentially [1, 2]. We developed a cloud computing infrastructure, Serratus, to enable ultra-high throughput sequence alignment at the petabase scale. We searched 5.7 million biologically diverse samples (10.2 petabases) for the hallmark gene RNA dependent RNA polymerase, identifying well over 105 novel RNA viruses and thereby expanding the number of known species by roughly an order of magnitude. We characterised novel viruses related to coronaviruses and to hepatitis{delta} virus, respectively and explored their environmental reservoirs. To catalyse a new era of viral discovery, we established a free and comprehensive database of these data and tools. Expanding the known sequence diversity of viruses can reveal the evolutionary origins of emerging pathogens and improve pathogen surveillance for the anticipation and mitigation of future pandemics.",

    "abstract": "The rapid emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a global pandemic affecting millions of individuals globally has necessitated sensitive and high-throughput approaches for the diagnosis, surveillance and for determining the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we used the COVIDSeq protocol, which involves multiplex-PCR, barcoding and sequencing of samples for high-throughput detection and deciphering the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. We used the approach on 752 clinical samples in duplicates, amounting to a total of 1536 samples which could be sequenced on a single S4 sequencing flow cell on NovaSeq 6000. Our analysis suggests a high concordance between technical duplicates and a high concordance of detection of SARS-CoV-2 between the COVIDSeq as well as RT-PCR approaches. An in-depth analysis revealed a total of six samples in which COVIDSeq detected SARS-CoV-2 in high confidence which were negative in RT-PCR. Additionally, the assay could detect SARS-CoV-2 in 21 samples and 16 samples which were classified inconclusive and pan-sarbeco positive respectively suggesting that COVIDSeq could be used as a confirmatory test. The sequencing approach also enabled insights into the evolution and genetic epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 samples. The samples were classified into a total of 3 clades. This study reports two lineages B.1.112 and B.1.99 for the first time in India. This study also revealed 1,143 unique single nucleotide variants and added a total of 73 novel variants identified for the first time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the COVIDSeq approach for detection and genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. Our analysis suggests that COVIDSeq could be a potential high sensitivity assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2, with an additional advantage of enabling genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "The end of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in Europe (~16.5 ka ago) set in motion major changes in human culture and population structure1. In Southern Europe, Early Epigravettian material culture was replaced by Late Epigravettian art and technology about 18-17 ka ago at the beginning of southern Alpine deglaciation, although available genetic evidence from individuals who lived ~14 ka ago2-5 opened up questions on the impact of migrations on this cultural transition only after that date. Here we generate new genomic data from a human mandible uncovered at the Late Epigravettian site of Riparo Tagliente (Veneto, Italy), that we directly dated to 16,980-16,510 cal BP (2{sigma}). This individual, affected by a low-prevalence dental pathology named focal osseous dysplasia, attests that the very emergence of Late Epigravettian material culture in Italy was already associated with migration and genetic replacement of the Gravettian-related ancestry. In doing so, we push back by at least 3,000 years the date of the diffusion in Southern Europe of a genetic component linked to Balkan/Anatolian refugia, previously believed to have spread during the later Bolling/Allerod warming event (~14 ka ago4,6). Our results suggest that demic diffusion from a genetically diverse population may have substantially contributed to cultural changes in LGM and post-LGM Southern Europe, independently from abrupt shifts to warmer and more favourable conditions.",

    "abstract": "A small fraction of HIV-1 infected humans develop potent broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against HIV-1 that can protect macaques from infection with simian immunodeficiency HIV chimeric virus (SHIV). Similarly, a small number of macaques infected with SHIVs also develop broadly neutralizing serologic activity, but less is known about the nature of these simian antibodies. Here we report on a monoclonal antibody, Ab1485, isolated from a macaque infected with SHIVAD8 that developed broadly neutralizing serologic activity mapping to the V3-glycan region of HIV-1 Env. Ab1485 neutralizes 38.1 % of HIV-1 isolates in a panel of 42 pseudoviruses with a geometric mean IC50 of 0.055 g/ml and SHIVAD8 with an IC50 of 0.028 g/ml. Ab1485 binds to the V3-glycan epitope in a glycan-dependent manner as determined by ELISA and neutralization assays with JRCSF mutant viruses. A 3.5 [A] cryo-electron microscopy structure of Ab1485 in complex with a native-like SOSIP Env trimer showed conserved contacts with the N332gp120 glycan and gp120 GDIR peptide motif, but in a distinct Env-binding orientation relative to human V3/N332gp120 glycan-targeting bNAbs. Finally, intravenous infusion of Ab1485 protected macaques from a high dose intrarectal challenge with SHIVAD8. We conclude that macaques can develop bNAbs against the V3-glycan patch that resemble human V3-glycan bNAbs.\n\nSignificance statementRhesus macaques infected with SHIV are an important model for evaluating HIV-1 prevention and therapy strategies and can also be used to evaluate humoral immune responses to candidate HIV-1 vaccines, but whether macaques produce human-like bNAbs has not been evaluated. Like HIV-1 infected humans, 10-20% of the SHIVAD8 challenged macaques develop low levels of neutralizing antibodies, and only one macaque has developed broad and potent serologic neutralizing activity. We have examined the antibody response of this macaque (CE8J) and we report on the cloning and molecular characterization of a bNAb produced in this elite neutralizing non-human primate, its structure bound to an HIV-1 Env trimer, and the implications for development of vaccines targeting the V3-glycan patch of Env.",

    "abstract": "A newly identified coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, emerged in December 2019 in Hubei Province, China, and quickly spread throughout the world; so far, it has caused more than 18 million cases of disease and 700,000 deaths. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently based on the detection of viral RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs by means of molecular-based assays, such as real-time RT-PCR. Furthermore, serological assays aimed at detecting different classes of antibodies constitute the best surveillance strategy for gathering information on the humoral immune response to infection and the spread of the virus through the population, in order to evaluate the immunogenicity of novel future vaccines and medicines for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 disease. The aim of this study was to determine SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in human serum samples by means of different commercial and in-house ELISA kits, in order to evaluate and compare their results first with one another and then with those yielded by functional assays using wild-type virus. It is important to know the level of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies in order to predict population immunity and possible cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses and to identify potentially infectious subjects. In addition, in a small sub-group of samples, we performed a subtyping Immunoglobulin G ELISA. Our data showed an excellent statistical correlation between the neutralization titer and the IgG, IgM and IgA ELISA response against the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein, confirming that antibodies against this portion of the virus spike protein are highly neutralizing and that the ELISA Receptor-Binding Domain-based assay can be used as a valid surrogate for the neutralization assay in laboratories which do not have Biosecurity level-3 facilities.",

    "abstract": "The efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in a pandemic that is unique in modern history. Despite early identification of ACE2 as the receptor for viral spike protein, much remains to be understood about the molecular events behind viral dissemination. We evaluated the contribution of C-type lectin receptors (CLRS) of antigen-presenting cells, widely present in air mucosa and lung tissue. DC-SIGN, L-SIGN, Langerin and MGL bind to diverse glycans of the spike using multiple interaction areas. Using pseudovirus and cells derived from monocytes or T-lymphocytes, we demonstrate that while virus capture by the CLRs examined does not allow direct cell infection, DC/L-SIGN, among these receptors, promote virus transfer to permissive ACE2+ cells. A glycomimetic compound designed against DC-SIGN, enable inhibition of this process. Thus, we described a mechanism potentiating viral capture and spreading of infection. Early involvement of APCs opens new avenues for understanding and treating the imbalanced innate immune response observed in COVID-19 pathogenesis",

    "abstract": "Speckled 140 KDa (SP140) is a nuclear body protein, mainly expressed in immune cells, which contains multiple domains suggestive of an epigenetic reader function; namely a bromodomain, a PHD domain and a SAND domain. Single nucleotide polymorphisms and epigenetic modifications in the SP140 locus have been linked to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases including Crohns disease (CD). However, little is known about the cellular function of SP140; this is due in part to the fact that, unlike for other many other epigenetic proteins, no small molecule inhibitors have been available to investigate the biological role of SP140. We report the discovery of the first small molecule SP140 inhibitor (GSK761) and utilize this to elucidate SP140 function in innate immune cells. We show that SP140 is highly expressed in CD68+ CD mucosal macrophages and in in vitro-generated inflammatory macrophages. SP140 inhibition through GSK761 reduced monocyte differentiation into inflammatory macrophages and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory activation, whilst inducing the generation of CD206+ regulatory macrophages that mark anti-TNF remission induction in CD patients. ChIP-seq analyses revealed that SP140 preferentially occupies transcriptional start sites (TSS) in inflammatory macrophages, with enrichment at gene loci encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and inflammatory pathways. GSK761 specifically reduced SP140 binding and thereby expression of SP140-dependent downstream inflammatory genes. Notably, in CD14+ macrophages isolated from CD intestinal-mucosa, GSK761 inhibited the spontaneous expression of cytokines, including TNF. Together, this study identifies SP140 as a druggable epigenetic reader and therapeutic target for CD.",

Whether BMP plays a role in antiviral immunity is unknown. Here we demonstrate that Bmp8a is a newly-identified positive regulator for antiviral immune responses. The bmp8a-/- zebrafish, when infected with the viruses of GCRV, SVCV or TSVDV, show significantly reduced antiviral immunity, increased viral load and morbidity. We also show for the first time that Bmp8a interacts with Alk6a, which promotes the phosphorylation of Tbk1 and Irf3 through p38 MAPK pathway, and induces the production of type I IFNs in response to virus infection. Upon virus infection, bmp8a expression is activated through the binding of Stat1a/Stat1b to the GAS motifs in bmp8a promoter region, enlarging the antiviral innate immune signal. Our study uncovers a previously unrecognized role of Bmp8a in regulation of antiviral immune responses and provides a new target for controlling viral infection.",

It has been using by the people because of its wide range of therapeutic uses. Though, the considerable research had been conducted to reveal the biologically active compounds and its pharmacological effect, the rich constituent of this plant and its major biological perspective was yet to be studied comprehensively. Accordingly, the main focus of this study was the alpha amylase inhibition of methanolic extracts obtained from leaves and barks of Randia dumetorum plant. The plant extracts were obtained by dissolving dried plant with 100% methanol overnight and evaporating to the dryness. The obtained plant extract was used to study mentioned biological activities. The results obtained showed that the extract obtained from leaves and barks showed antioxidant and alpha amylase inhibition activities. This research can be helpful to discover new types of therapeutics in the future.",

    "abstract": "MotivationPopulation-level genetic variation enables competitiveness and niche specialization in microbial communities. Despite the difficulty in culturing many microbes from an environment, we can still study these communities by isolating and sequencing DNA directly from an environment (metagenomics). Recovering the genomic sequences of all isoforms of a given gene across all organisms in a metagenomic sample would aid evolutionary and ecological insights into microbial ecosystems with potential benefits for medicine and biotechnology. A significant obstacle to this goal arises from the lack of a computationally tractable solution that can recover these sequences from sequenced read fragments. This poses a problem analogous to reconstructing the two sequences that make up the genome of a diploid organism (i.e. haplotypes), but for an unknown number of individuals.\n\nResultsThe problem of single individual haplotyping (SIH) was first formalised by Lancia et al in 2001. Now, nearly two decades later, we discuss the complexity of \"haplotyping\" metagenomic samples, with a new formalisation of Lancia et al  s data structure that allows us to effectively extend the single individual haplotype problem to microbial communities. This work describes and formalizes the problem of recovering genes (and other genomic subsequences) from all individuals within a complex community sample: which we term the metagenomic individual haplotyping (MIH) problem. We also provide software implementations of our proposed pairwise single nucleotide variant (SNV) co-occurrence matrix and greedy graph traversal algorithm.\n\nAvailability and implementationOur reference implementation of the described pairwise SNV matrix (Hansel) and greedy haplotype path traversal algorithm (Gretel) are open source, MIT licensed and freely available online at github.com/samstudio8/hansel and github.com/samstudio8/gretel, respectively.\n\nContact s.nicholls.1@bham.ac.uk",

We use a dataset of smartphone and Fitbit data collected from 138 college students over a semester to evaluate the frameworks ability to 1) model biobehavioral rhythms of students, 2) measure the stability of their rhythms over the course of the semester, 3) model differences between rhythms of students with different health status, and 4) predict the mental health status in students using the model of their biobehavioral rhythms. Our evaluation provides evidence for the feasibility of using CoRhythMo for modeling and discovering human rhythms and using them to assess and predict different life and health outcomes.",

    "abstract": "As an intracellular pathogen, the reproduction of hepatitis B virus (HBV) depends on the occupancy of host metabolism machinery. Here we test a hypothesis if HBV may govern intracellular biosynthesis to achieve a productive reproduction. To test this hypothesis, we set up an affinity purification screen for host factors that interact with viral large surface antigen (LHBS). This identified pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2), a key regulator of glucose metabolism, as a binding partner of LHBS. We showed that the expression of LHBS affected oligomerization of PKM2 in hepatocytes, and thereby increased glucose consumption and lactate production, a phenomenon known as aerobic glycolysis. Interestingly, recovering PKM2 activity in hepatocytes by chemical activators, TEPP-46 or DASA-58, reduced biosynthesis of viral surface and core antigens. In addition, reduction of glycolysis by culturing in low-glucose condition or treatment with 2-deoxyglucose also decreased biosynthesis of viral surface antigen, without affecting general host proteins. Finally, TEPP-46 largely suppressed proliferation of LHBS-positive cells on 3-dimensional agarose plates, but showed no effect on the traditional 2-dimensional cell culture. Taken together, these results indicate that virus-induced metabolic switch may support de novo biosynthesis of HBV in hepatocytes. In addition, aerobic glycolysis is likely essential for LHBS-mediated oncogenesis. Accordingly, restriction of glucose metabolism may be considered as a novel strategy to restrain viral mediated biosynthesis and oncogenesis during chronic HBV infection.\n\nAuthor summaryChronic HBV infection is a life-long threat of patients, with a 25~40% increased risk of developing liver cirrhosis and cancer. Persistent expression of oncogenic viral products in the liver, especially LHBS, is an oncogenic caveat and resistant to current antiviral agents. Here we show that viral LHBS binds to host PKM2 and diminishes its kinase activity. This virus-host interaction induces metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis, with increased glucose consumption and lactate production. We show that such metabolic switch not only favors biosynthesis of HBV but also provokes hepatocarcinogenesis. Notably, restoration of PKM2 activity by chemical activators decreases expressions of viral products and largely suppresses virus-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis. This study highlights the importance of host metabolism in supporting viral biosynthesis and indicates a novel therapeutic approach to control chronic HBV infection via modulating host metabolic switch.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the distribution of sites at which replication forks stall, and the ensuing fork processing events, requires genome-wide methods sensitive to both changes in replication fork structure and the formation of recombinogenic DNA ends. Here we describe Transferase-Activated End Ligation sequencing (TrAEL-seq), a method that captures single stranded DNA 3 ends genome-wide and with base pair resolution. TrAEL-seq labels DNA breaks, and profiles both stalled and processive replication forks in yeast and mammalian cells. Replication forks stalling at defined barriers and expressed genes are detected by TrAEL-seq with exceptional signal-to-noise, most likely through labelling of DNA 3 ends exposed during fork reversal. TrAEL-seq also labels unperturbed processive replication forks to yield maps of replication fork direction similar to those obtained by Okazaki fragment sequencing, however TrAEL-seq is performed on asynchronous populations of wild-type cells without incorporation of labels, cell sorting, or biochemical purification of replication intermediates, rendering TrAEL-seq simpler and more widely applicable than existing replication fork direction profiling methods. The specificity of TrAEL-seq for DNA 3 ends also allows accurate detection of double strand break sites after the initiation of DNA end resection, which we demonstrate by genome-wide mapping of meiotic double strand break hotspots in a dmc1{Delta} mutant. Overall, TrAEL-seq provides a flexible and robust methodology with high sensitivity and resolution for studying DNA replication and repair, which will be of significant use in determining mechanisms of genome instability.",

    "abstract": "The Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), composed of six subunits, ORC1-6, binds to origins of replication as a ring-shaped heterohexameric ATPase that is believed to be essential to recruit and load MCM2-7 around DNA and initiate DNA replication. We had reported the creation of viable cancer cell lines that lacked detectable ORC1 or ORC2 protein without a significant decrease in the number of origins firing. We now report that human HCT116 colon cancer cells also survive with a mutation in the initiator ATG of the ORC5 gene that abolishes the expression of ORC5 protein. Even if an internal methionine is used to produce an undetectable, N terminally deleted ORC5, the protein would lack 80% of the AAA+ ATPase domain, including the Walker A motif. The ORC5-depleted cells show normal chromatin binding of MCM2-7 and initiate replication from similar number of origins as wild type cells. In addition, we introduced a second mutation in ORC2 in the ORC5 mutant cells rendering both ORC5 and ORC2 proteins undetectable in the same cells, and destabilizing the ORC1, ORC3 and ORC4 proteins. Yet the double mutant cells grow, recruit MCM2-7 normally to chromatin and initiate DNA replication with normal number of origins. Thus, in these selected cancer cells, either a crippled ORC lacking ORC2 and ORC5 and present at minimal levels on the chromatin can recruit and load enough MCM2-7 to initiate DNA replication, or human cell-lines can sometimes recruit MCM2-7 to origins independent of ORC.",

    "abstract": "Age-related diseases pose great challenges to health care systems worldwide. During aging, endothelial senescence increases the risk for cardiovascular disease. Recently, it was described that Phosphatase 1 Nuclear Targeting Subunit (PNUTS) has a central role in cardiomyocyte aging and homeostasis. Here, we determined the role of PNUTS in endothelial cell aging. We confirmed that PNUTS is repressed in senescent endothelial cells (ECs). Moreover, PNUTS silencing elicits several of the hallmarks of endothelial aging: senescence, reduced angiogenesis and loss of barrier function. To validate our findings in vivo, we generated an endothelial-specific inducible PNUTS-deficient mouse line (Cdh5-CreERT2;PNUTSfl/fl), termed PNUTSEC-KO. Two weeks after PNUTS deletion, PNUTSEC-KO mice presented severe multiorgan failure and vascular leakage. We showed that the PNUTS binding motif for protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is essential to maintain endothelial barrier function. Transcriptomic analysis of PNUTS-silenced HUVECs and lungs of PNUTSEC-KO mice revealed that the PNUTS-PP1 axis tightly regulates the expression of semaphorin 3B (SEMA3B). Indeed, silencing of SEMA3B completely restored barrier function after PNUTS loss-of-function. These results reveal a pivotal role for PNUTS in endothelial homeostasis through a PP1-SEMA3B downstream pathway that provides a potential target against the effects of aging in ECs.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic affects millions of people worldwide with a rising death toll. The causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), uses its nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) to redirect host translation machinery to the viral RNA by binding to the ribosome and suppressing cellular, but not viral, protein synthesis through yet unknown mechanisms. We show here that among all viral proteins, Nsp1 has the largest impact on host viability in the cells of human lung origin. Differential expression analysis of mRNA-seq data revealed that Nsp1 broadly alters the transcriptome in human cells. The changes include repression of major gene clusters in ribosomal RNA processing, translation, mitochondria function, cell cycle and antigen presentation; and induction of factors in transcriptional regulation. We further gained a mechanistic understanding of the Nsp1 function by determining the cryo-EM structure of the Nsp1-40S ribosomal subunit complex, which shows that Nsp1 inhibits translation by plugging the mRNA entry channel of the 40S. We also determined the cryo-EM structure of the 48S preinitiation complex (PIC) formed by Nsp1, 40S, and the cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) RNA, which shows that this 48S PIC is nonfunctional due to the incorrect position of the 3 region of the mRNA. Results presented here elucidate the mechanism of host translation inhibition by SARS-CoV-2, provide insight into viral protein synthesis, and furnish a comprehensive understanding of the impacts from one of the most potent pathogenicity factors of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nHighlightsORF screen identified Nsp1 as a major cellular pathogenicity factor of SARS-CoV-2\n\nNsp1 broadly alters the gene expression programs in human cells\n\nNsp1 inhibits translation by blocking mRNA entry channel\n\nNsp1 prevents physiological conformation of the 48S PIC",

There are currently two formats that are widely used: non-magnetic beads or magnetic beads. Data is lacking regarding the comparability of results obtained using these two types of beads, and for assays run on different instruments. Whilst non-magnetic beads can only be run on flow-based instruments (such as the Luminex(R) 100/200 or Bio-Plex(R) 200), magnetic beads can be run on both these and the newer MAGPIX(R) instruments. In this study we utilized a panel of purified recombinant Plasmodium vivax proteins and samples from malaria-endemic areas to measure P. vivax-specific IgG responses using different combinations of beads and instruments. We directly compared: i) non-magnetic versus magnetic beads run on a Bio-Plex(R) 200, ii) magnetic beads run on the Bio-Plex(R) 200 versus MAGPIX(R) and iii) non-magnetic beads run on a Bio-Plex(R) 200 versus magnetic beads run on the MAGPIX(R). We also performed an external validation of our optimized assay. We observed that IgG antibody responses, measured against our panel of P. vivax proteins, were strongly correlated in all three of our comparisons, however higher amounts of protein were required for coupling to magnetic beads. Our external validation indicated that results generated in different laboratories using the same coupled beads are also highly comparable, particularly if a reference standard curve is used.",

    "abstract": "Genome assembly of short reads from large plant genomes remains a challenge in computational biology despite major developments in Next Generation sequencing. Of late multiple draft assemblies of plant genomes are reported in many organisms. The draft assemblies of Cajanus cajan are with different levels of genome completeness; contain large number of repeats, gaps and segmental duplications. Draft assemblies with portions of genome missing, are shorter than the referenced original genome. These assemblies come with low map accuracy affecting further functional annotation and prediction of gene component as desired by crop researchers. Genome coverage i.e. number of sequenced raw reads mapped on to certain locations of the genome is an important quality indicator of completeness and assembly quality in draft assemblies. Present work was aimed at improvement of coverage in reported de novo sequenced draft genomes (GCA_000340665.1 and GCA_000230855.2) of Pigeonpea, a legume widely cultivated in India. The two assemblies comprised 72% and 75% of estimated coverage of genome respectively. We employed assembly reconciliation approach to compare draft assemblies and merged them to generate a high quality near complete assembly with enhanced contiguity. Finished assembly has reduced number of gaps than reported in draft assemblies and improved genome coverage of 82.4%. Quality of the finished assembly was evaluated using various quality metrics and for presence of specific trait related functional genes. Employed pair-end and mate-pair local library data sets enabled to resolve gaps, repeats and other sequence errors yielding lengthier scaffolds compared to two draft assemblies.

We identified a set of hierarchical cellular diffusion barriers, whereby the left-right axis separation of the neocortex occurs prior to anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axis separation.

Furthermore, the transcriptional programs driving an LSEC fate have not yet been described. Here, we first present a computational workflow (CenTFinder) that can identify transcription factors (TFs) that are crucial for modulating pathways involved in cell lineage specification. Using CenTFinder, we identified several novel LSEC-specific protein markers such as FCN2 and FCN3, which were validated by analysis of previously published single-cell RNAseq data. We also identified PU.1 (encoded by the SPI1 gene) as a major regulator of LSEC-specific immune functions. We show that SPI1 overexpression (combined with the general EC transcription factor ETV2) in human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) induces ECs with an LSEC-like phenotype. The ETV2-SPI1-ECs display increased expression of LSEC markers such as CD32B and MRC1 as well as several of the proposed novel markers. More importantly, ETV2-SPI1-ECs acquire LSEC functions, including uptake of FSA-FITC as well as labelled IgG. In conclusion, we present the CenTFinder computational tool to identify key regulatory TFs within specific pathways, in this work pathways of lineage specification, and we demonstrate its use by the identification and validation of PU.1 as a master regulator for LSEC fating.",

    "abstract": "Many specialized cells use unconventional strategies of cytoskeletal control. Nematode spermatocytes discard their actin and tubulin following meiosis, and instead employ the regulated assembly/disassembly of the Major Sperm Protein (MSP) to drive sperm motility. However prior to the meiotic divisions, MSP is effectively sequestered as it exclusively assembles into paracrystalline structures called fibrous bodies (FBs). The accessory proteins that direct this sequestration process have remained mysterious. This study reveals SPE-18 as an intrinsically disordered protein that that is essential for MSP assembly within FBs. In spe-18 mutant spermatocytes, MSP remains cytosolic, and the cells arrest in meiosis. In wildtype spermatocytes, SPE-18 localizes to pre-FB complexes and functions with the kinase SPE-6 to recruit MSP. Changing patterns of SPE-18 localization revealed unappreciated complexities in FB maturation. Later, within newly individualized spermatids, SPE -18 is rapidly lost, yet SPE-18 loss alone is insufficient for MSP disassembly. Our findings reveal an alternative strategy for sequestering cytoskeletal elements, not as monomers but in localized, bundled polymers. Additionally, these studies provide an important example of disordered proteins promoting ordered cellular structures.\n\nSummary StatementIntrinsically disordered proteins are increasingly recognized as key regulators of localized cytoskeletal assembly. Expanding that paradigm, SPE-18 localizes MSP assembly within C. elegans spermatocytes.",

    "abstract": "LMX1B haploinsufficiency causes Nail-patella syndrome (NPS; MIM 161200), characterized by nail dysplasia, absent/hypoplastic patellae, chronic kidney disease, and glaucoma. Accordingly, in mice Lmx1b has been shown to play crucial roles in the development of the limb, kidney and eye. Although one functional allele of murine Lmx1b appears adequate for development, Lmx1b null mice display ventral-ventral distal limbs with abnormal kidney, eye and cerebellar development, more disruptive, but fully concordant with NPS. Interestingly, in Lmx1b functional knockouts (KOs), Lmx1b transcription in the limb is decreased nearly 6-fold indicating autoregulation. Herein, we report on two conserved Lmx1b-associated cis-regulatory modules (LARM1 and LARM2) that are bound by Lmx1b, amplify Lmx1b expression in the limb and are necessary for Lmx1b-mediated limb dorsalization. Remarkably, we also report on two NPS patient families with normal LMX1B coding sequence, but loss-of-function variations in the LARM1/2 region, stressing the role of regulatory modules in disease pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death worldwide, but there are currently no available methods to stimulate growth or regeneration of artery networks in diseased hearts. Studying how arteries are built during embryonic development could illuminate strategies for re-building these vessels in the setting of ischemic heart disease. We previously found, using loss-of-function experiments, that the transcription factor Dach1 is required for coronary artery development in mouse embryos. Here, we report that Dach1 overexpression in endothelial cells (ECs) extended coronary arteries and improved survival and heart function in adult mice following myocardial infarction (MI). Dach1 overexpression increased the length and number of arterial end branches, in both heart and retinal vasculature, by causing additional capillary ECs to differentiate into arterial ECs and contribute to growing arteries. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of ECs undergoing Dach1-induced arterial specification indicated that it potentiated normal artery differentiation, rather than functioning as a master regulator of artery cell fate. ScRNAseq also showed that normal arterial differentiation is accompanied by repression of lipid metabolism genes, which were also repressed by Dach1 prior to arterialization. Together, these results demonstrate that increasing the expression level of Dach1 is a novel pathway for driving specification of artery ECs and extending arterial vessels, which could be explored as a means of increasing artery coverage to mitigate the effects of CAD.",

    "abstract": "Deoxygenation, the reduction of oxygen level in the oceans induced by global warming and anthropogenic disturbances, is a major threat to marine life. This change in oxygen level could be especially harmful to marine embryos that utilize endogenous hypoxia and redox gradients as morphogens during normal development. Here we show that the tolerance to hypoxic conditions changes between different developmental stages of the sea urchin embryo, due to the structure of the gene regulatory networks (GRNs). We demonstrate that during normal development, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway restricts the activity of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway to two lateral domains and by that controls proper skeletal patterning. Hypoxia applied during early development strongly perturbs the activity of Nodal and BMP pathways that affect VEGF pathway, dorsal-ventral (DV) and skeletogenic patterning. These pathways are largely unaffected by hypoxia applied after DV axis formation. We propose that the use of redox and hypoxia as morphogens makes the sea urchin embryo highly sensitive to environmental hypoxia during early development, but the GRN structure provides higher tolerance to hypoxia at later stages.\n\nSummary statementThe use of hypoxia and redox gradients as morphogens makes sea urchin early development sensitive to environmental hypoxia. This sensitivity decreases later, due to the structure of the gene regulatory network.",

    "abstract": "A change detection analysis utilizing Very High-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery was performed to evaluate the changes in benthic composition and coastal vegetation in La Parguera, southwestern Puerto Rico, attributable to the increased influx of pelagic Sargassum spp and its accumulations in cays, bays, inlets and near-shore environments. Satellite imagery was co-registered, corrected for atmospheric effects, and masked for water and land. A Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and an unsupervised classification scheme were applied to the imagery to evaluate the changes in coastal vegetation and benthic composition. These products were used to calculate the differences from 2010 baseline imagery, to potential hurricane impacts (2018 image), and potential Sargassum impacts (2020 image). Results show a negative trend in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from 2010 to 2020 for the total pixel area of 24%, or 546,446 m2. These changes were also observed in true color images from 2010 to 2020. Changes in the NDVI negative values from 2018 to 2020 were higher, especially for the Isla Cueva site (97%) and were consistent with the field observations and drone surveys conducted since 2018 in the area. The major changes from 2018 and 2020 occurred mainly in unconsolidated sediments (e.g. sand, mud) and submerged aquatic vegetation (e.g. seagrass, algae), which can have similar spectra limiting the differentiation from multi-spectral imagery. Areas prone to Sargassum accumulation were identified using a combination of 2018 and 2020 true color VHR imagery and drone observations. This approach provides a quantifiable method to evaluate Sargassum impacts to the coastal vegetation and benthic composition using change detection of VHR images, and to separate these effects from other extreme events.",

    "abstract": "It is well established that antibiotic treatment selects for resistance in pathogenic bacteria. However, the evolutionary responses of pathogen populations to antibiotic treatment during infections remain poorly resolved, especially in acute infections. Here we map the evolutionary responses to treatment in high definition through genomic and phenotypic characterization of >100 isolates from a patient with P. aeruginosa pneumonia. Antibiotic therapy (meropenem, colistin) caused a rapid crash of the P. aeruginosa population in the lung, but this decline was followed by the spread of meropenem resistance mutations that restrict antibiotic uptake (oprD) or modify LPS biosynthesis (wbpM). Low fitness strains with high-level meropenem resistance (oprD) were then replaced by high fitness strains with  anti-resistance mutations in the MexAB-OprM efflux pump, causing a rapid decline in resistance to both meropenem and a collateral loss of resistance to a broad spectrum of antibiotics. In contrast, we did not observe any evolutionary responses to antibiotic treatment in the intestinal population of P. aeruginosa. Carbapenem antibiotics are key to the treatment of infections caused by Gram negative pathogens, and our work highlights the ability of natural selection to drive both the rapid rise and fall of carbapenem resistance during acute infections.",

    "abstract": "Mutations of the adaptor protein-2 sigma subunit (AP2S1) gene which encodes AP2{sigma}2, a component of the ubiquitous AP2 heterotetrameric complex involved in endosomal trafficking of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), cause familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 3 (FHH3). FHH3 patients have heterozygous AP2S1 missense Arg15 mutations (p.Arg15Cys, p.Arg15His or p.Arg15Leu) with marked hypercalcemia and occasional hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia. To further characterise the phenotypic spectrum and calcitropic pathophysiology of FHH3, we used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to generate mice harboring the AP2S1 p.Arg15Leu mutation, which causes the most severe FHH3 phenotype. Heterozygous (Ap2s1+/L15) mice were viable, and had marked hypercalcemia, hypermagnesemia, hypophosphatemia, and increased plasma concentrations of parathyroid hormone, fibroblast growth factor 23 and alkaline phosphatase activity, but normal pro-collagen type 1 N-terminal pro-peptide and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D. Homozygous (Ap2s1L15/L15) mice invariably died perinatally. The AP2S1 p.Arg15Leu mutation impaired protein-protein interactions between AP2{sigma}2 and the other AP2 subunits, and the CaSR. Cinacalcet, a CaSR allosteric activator, ameliorated the hypercalcemia and elevated PTH concentrations, but not the diminished AP2{sigma}2-CaSR interaction. Thus, our studies have established a mouse model with a germline loss-of-function AP2S1 mutation that is representative for FHH3 in humans, and demonstrated that cinacalcet corrects the abnormalities of plasma calcium and PTH.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) are DNA sequences that can mobilize and proliferate throughout eukaryotic genomes. Previous studies have shown that in plant genomes, TEs can influence gene expression in various ways such as inserting in introns or exons to alter transcript structure and content, and providing novel promoters and regulatory elements to generate new regulatory patterns. Furthermore, TEs can also regulate gene expression at the epigenetic level by modifying chromatin structure, changing DNA methylation status and generating small RNAs. In this study, we demonstrated that Ac/fAc transposable elements are able to induce ectopic gene expression by duplicating and shuffling enhancer elements. Ac/fAc elements belong to the hAT family of Class II TEs. They can undergo standard transposition events, which involve the two termini of a single transposon, or alternative transposition events which involve the termini of two different, nearby elements. Our previous studies have shown that alternative transposition can generate various genome rearrangements such as deletions, duplications, inversions, translocations and Composite Insertions (CIs). We identified over 50 independent cases of CIs generated by Ac/fAc alternative transposition and analyzed 10 of them in detail. We show that these CIs induced ectopic expression of the maize pericarp color 2 (p2) gene, which encodes a Myb-related protein. All the CIs analyzed contain sequences including a transcriptional enhancer derived from the nearby p1 gene, suggesting that the CI-induced activation of p2 is effected by mobilization of the p1 enhancer. This is further supported by analysis of a mutant in which the CI is excised and p2 expression is lost. These results show that alternative transposition events are not only able to induce genome rearrangements, but also generate Composite Insertions that can control gene expression.\n\nSummaryWhen Barbara McClintock originally identified and characterized Transposable Elements (TEs) in maize, she termed them \"Controlling Elements\" due to their effects on gene expression. Here we show that maize Ac/Ds TEs can acquire a genomic enhancer and generate Composite Insertions (CIs) that activate expression of a nearby gene. CIs are structurally variable elements that include TE termini enclosing sequences from an original donor locus, and are formed when the termini of two nearby TEs transpose during S phase from a replicated to unreplicated site. In this way, TEs may acquire genomic enhancers to generate Controlling Elements as described by McClintock.",

    "abstract": "Human crowds provide paradigmatic examples of collective behavior emerging through self-organization. Although the underlying interaction has been considered to obey the distance-dependent law, resembling physical particle systems, recent findings emphasized that pedestrian motions are fundamentally influenced by the anticipated future positions of their neighbors rather than their current positions. Therefore, anticipatory interaction may play a crucial role in collective patterning. However, whether and how individual anticipation functionally benefits the group is not well-understood. We suggest that collective patterning in human crowds is promoted by anticipatory path-seeking behavior resulting in a scale-free movement pattern, called the Levy walk. In our experiments of lane formation, a striking example of self-organized patterning in human crowds where people moving in opposite directions spontaneously segregate into several unidirectional lanes, we manipulated some pedestrians ability to anticipate by having them type on a mobile phone while walking. The manipulation slowed overall walking speeds and delayed the onset of global patterning, and the distracted pedestrians sometimes failed to achieve their usual walking strategy. Moreover, we observed that the delay of global patterning depends on decisions made by pedestrians who were moving toward the distracted ones and had no choice but to take sudden large steps, presumably because of difficulty in anticipating the motions of their counterparts. These results imply that mutual anticipation between pedestrians facilitates efficient transition to emergent patterning in situations where nobody within a crowd is distracted. Our findings may contribute to efficient crowd management and inform future models of self-organizing systems.",

    "abstract": "In order to interpret animal behaviour we need to understand how they see the world. As colour discrimination is almost impossible to test directly in animals, it is important to develop theoretical models based in the properties of visual systems. One of the most successful is the receptor noise-limited (RNL) model, which depends only on the level of noise in photoreceptors and opponent mechanisms. Here optimal colour discrimination properties are obtained using information theoretical tools, for the early stages of visual systems with and without colour opponent mechanisms. For most biologically relevant conditions the optimal discrimination function of an ideal observer coincides with the one obtained with the RNL model. Many variants of the model can be cast into the same framework, which permits meaningful comparisons across species. For example, it is shown that the presence of opponency seems to be the preferred hypothesis for bees, but not for budgerigars. Since this is a consequence of the presence of oil droplets, this could also be true for most other species of birds.",

We present the NMR solution structure for DolP, which is composed of two BON domains that form an interconnected opposing pair. The C-terminal BON domain binds to anionic phospholipids through an extensive membrane:protein interface providing evidence of subcellular localization of these phospholipids within the outer membrane. This interaction is essential for DolP function and is required for sub-cellular localization of the protein to the cell division site.

Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is a crucial protein expressed by IAV to evade the host immune system. Additionally, NS1 has been proposed to stimulate translation because of its ability to bind poly(A) binding protein 1 (PABP1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G). We analyzed the interaction of NS1 with PABP1 using quantitative techniques. Our studies show that NS1 binds as a homodimer to PABP1, and this interaction is conserved across different IAV strains. Unexpectedly, NS1 does not bind to PABP1 that is bound to poly(A) RNA. Instead, NS1 only binds to PABP1 free of RNA, suggesting that translation stimulation does not occur by NS1 interacting with the PABP1 molecule attached to the mRNA 3-poly(A) tail. We propose that NS1 binds to the eIF4G complex at the 5-end of the mRNA and recruits the RNA-free PABP1, which may stimulate translation initiation by promoting the association of the ribosomal subunits.",

    "abstract": "Without an effective prophylactic solution, infections from SARS-CoV-2 continue to rise worldwide with devastating health and economic costs. SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into host cells via an interaction between its Spike protein and the host cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Disruption of this interaction confers potent neutralization of viral entry, providing an avenue for vaccine design and for therapeutic antibodies. Here, we develop single-domain antibodies (nanobodies) that potently disrupt the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and ACE2. By screening a yeast surface-displayed library of synthetic nanobody sequences, we identified a panel of nanobodies that bind to multiple epitopes on Spike and block ACE2 interaction via two distinct mechanisms. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed that one exceptionally stable nanobody, Nb6, binds Spike in a fully inactive conformation with its receptor binding domains (RBDs) locked into their inaccessible down-state, incapable of binding ACE2. Affinity maturation and structure-guided design of multivalency yielded a trivalent nanobody, mNb6-tri, with femtomolar affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike and picomolar neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. mNb6-tri retains stability and function after aerosolization, lyophilization, and heat treatment. These properties may enable aerosol-mediated delivery of this potent neutralizer directly to the airway epithelia, promising to yield a widely deployable, patient-friendly prophylactic and/or early infection therapeutic agent to stem the worst pandemic in a century.",

    "abstract": "Delay in diagnosis of renal injury has profound impacts on morbidity and mortality. Damage of proximal tubules by the injury impairs not only individual membrane transport proteins but also coordinated transport systems. In this study, we analyzed the proteome of apical membranes of proximal tubular epithelium from the mouse kidney with early ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), a well-known acute kidney injury (AKI) model. The proteome showed drastic elevations of the injury-responsive proteins and depressions of abundant transporters, leading to the prediction of biomarkers for early IRI. As the benchmark of our in-depth analysis from the proteome, we characterized transporters for D-serine, a promising renal diseases biomarker. Using cell-based and cell-free methods, we identified sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporters (SMCTs) as the D-serine transporters. This finding enlightens the role of non-canonical substrate transport and clarifies the D-serine transport systems in the kidney. Our approaches can be applied for investigation of other membrane transport systems.\n\nImpact statementProteomics and biochemical analysis reveal D-serine as a non-canonical substrate of sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter SMCTs",

    "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms by which receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and heterotrimeric G proteins, two major signaling hubs in eukaryotes, independently relay signals across the plasma membrane have been extensively characterized. How these hubs crosstalk has been a long-standing question, but answers remain elusive. Using linear-ion-trap mass spectrometry in combination with biochemical, cellular, and computational approaches, we unravel a mechanism of activation of heterotrimeric G proteins by RTKs and chart the key steps that mediate such activation. Upon growth factor stimulation, the guanine-nucleotide exchange modulator, GIV, dissociates Gi*{beta}{gamma} trimers, scaffolds monomeric Gi with RTKs, and facilitates the phosphorylation on two tyrosines located within the inter-domain cleft of Gi. Phosphorylation triggers the activation of Gi and inhibits second messengers (cAMP). Tumor-associated mutants reveal how constitutive activation of this pathway impacts cells decision to  go vs.  grow. These insights define a tyrosine-based G protein signaling paradigm and reveal its importance in eukaryotes.\n\nSignificance StatementGrowth factors and heterotrimeric G proteins are two of the most widely studied signaling pathways in eukaryotes; their crosstalk shapes some of the most fundamental cellular responses in both health and disease. Although mechanisms by which G protein pathways transactivate growth factor RTKs has been well-defined, how the reverse may happen is less understood. This study defines the key steps and cellular consequences of a fundamental mechanism of signal crosstalk that enables RTKs to transactivate heterotrimeric G protein, Gi. Mutations found in tumors shed light on how derailing this mechanism impacts tumor cell behavior. Thus, findings not only show how cells integrate extracellular signals via pathway crosstalk, but also demonstrate the relevance of this pathway in cancers.",

    "abstract": "The precise regulation of microtubule length during mitosis is essential to assemble and position the mitotic spindle and segregate chromosomes. Prior work has identified key molecular players in this process, including the kinesin-18 Kif18b and the kinesin-13 Kif2C/MCAK, which both promote microtubule depolymerization. MCAK acts as a potent microtubule depolymerase diffusing short distances on microtubules, while Kif18b is a mitotic processive motor with weak depolymerase activity. However the individual activities of these factors cannot explain the dramatic increase in microtubule dynamics in mitosis. Using in vitro reconstitution and single molecule imaging, we demonstrate that Kif18b, MCAK and the plus-end tracking protein EB3 act in an integrated manner to potently promote microtubule depolymerization. We find Kif18b acts as a microtubule plus end delivery factor for its cargo MCAK, and that Kif18b also promotes EB accumulation to plus ends independently of lattice nucleotide state. Together, our work defines the mechanistic basis for a cooperative Kif18b-EB-MCAK network with emergent properties, that acts to efficiently shorten microtubules in mitosis.",

    "abstract": "Intricate formulation methods and/or use of sophisticated equipment limit the prevalence of liposomal dosage-forms. Simple techniques are developed to assemble amphiphiles into globular lamellae while transiting from immiscible organic to the aqueous phase. Various parameters are optimized by injecting chloroform solution of amphiphiles into the aqueous phase and subsequent removal of the organic phase. Further simplification is achieved by reorienting amphiphiles through a spontaneous phase transition in a swirling biphasic system during evaporation of the organic phase under vacuum. Although the chloroform injection yields smaller size and PDI yet spontaneous phase transition method overrides simplicity and productivity. The size distribution of liposomes and solid/solvent ratio in both or any phases of formulation show direct relation. Surface charge dependant large unilamellar vesicles with a narrow distribution have PDI <0.4 in 10 M saline. As small and monodisperse liposomes are prerequisites in targeted drug delivery strategies. Hence the desired size distribution <200 d.nm and PDI <0.15 is obtained through serial membrane-filtration method. Phosphatidylcholine/water 4 mol/ml is achieved at a temperature of 10{degrees}C below the phase-transition temperature of phospholipids ensuing suitability for thermolabile entities and high entrapment efficiency. Both methods furnish the de-novo rearrangement of amphophiles into globular lamellae aiding in the larger entrapped volume. The immiscible organic phase facilitates faster and complete removable of the organic phase. High cholesterol content (55.6 mol%) imparts stability in primary hydration medium at 5+3{degrees}C for 6 months in light-protected type-1 glass vial. Collectively the reported methods are novel, scalable, time-efficient yielding high productivity in simple equipment.",

    "abstract": "Neutralizing agents against SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed for treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19. Here, we present a strategy to rapidly identify and assemble synthetic human variable heavy (VH) domain binders with high affinity toward neutralizing epitopes without the need for high-resolution structural information. We constructed a VH-phage library and targeted a known neutralizing site, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding interface of the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding domain (Spike-RBD). Using a masked selection approach, we identified 85 unique VH binders to two non-overlapping epitopes within the ACE2 binding site on Spike-RBD. This enabled us to systematically link these VH domains into multivalent and bi-paratopic formats. These multivalent and bi-paratopic VH constructs showed a marked increase in affinity to Spike (up to 600-fold) and neutralization potency (up to 1400-fold) on pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus when compared to the standalone VH domains. The most potent binder, a trivalent VH, neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 with half-minimal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 4.0 nM (180 ng/mL). A cryo-EM structure of the trivalent VH bound to Spike shows each VH domain bound an RBD at the ACE2 binding site, explaining its increased neutralization potency and confirming our original design strategy. Our results demonstrate that targeted selection and engineering campaigns using a VH-phage library can enable rapid assembly of highly avid and potent molecules towards therapeutically important protein interfaces.",

Yet, specific TRPV2 agonists and antagonists are currently unavailable. Their development requires a precise knowledge of how the currently known non-specific small molecules interact with TRPV2 at the molecular level. Here we present TRPV2 structures in ligand-bound states resolved by cryo-electron microscopy in the presence of 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-ABP), 2-APB with doxorubicin (DOXO), and ruthenium red (RR). We identified a novel 2-APB drug binding site between the S5 helix and S4-S5 linker on two adjacent TRPV2 monomers and determined the mechanism of TRPV2 pore block by RR. We also showed that a large organic molecule like DOXO can enter the TRPV2 pore in the presence of 2-APB. Additionally, we discovered a structural lipid bound in a unique position in the \"vanilloid pocket\", which is absent in the 2-APB-bound state of the channel, allowing us to propose a model for TRPV2 channel gating. Together, this work provides a further understanding of TRPV2 function and a structural framework for the development of TRPV2-specific modulators.",

    "abstract": "The proper structural organization of the microtubule-based spindle during cell division requires the collective activity of many different types of proteins. These include non-motor microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) whose functions include crosslinking microtubules to regulate filament sliding rates and assembling microtubule arrays. One such protein is PRC1, an essential MAP that has been shown to preferentially crosslink overlapping antiparallel microtubules at the spindle midzone. PRC1 has been proposed to act as a molecular brake, but insight into the mechanism of how PRC1 molecules function cooperatively to resist motor-driven microtubule sliding and to allow for the formation of stable midzone overlaps has been lacking. Here we employ a modified microtubule gliding assay to rupture PRC1-mediated microtubule pairs using surface-bound kinesins. We discovered that PRC1 crosslinks always reduce bundled filament sliding velocities relative to single microtubule gliding rates, and do so via two distinct emergent modes of mechanical resistance to motor-driven sliding. We term these behaviors braking and coasting, where braking events exhibit substantially slowed microtubule sliding compared to coasting events. Strikingly, braking behavior requires the formation of two distinct high-density clusters of PRC1 molecules near microtubule tips. Our results suggest a cooperative mechanism for PRC1 accumulation when under mechanical load that leads to a unique state of enhanced resistance to filament sliding and provides insight into collective protein ensemble behavior in regulating the mechanics of spindle assembly.",

    "abstract": "Molecular motors couple chemical transitions to conformational changes that perform mechanical work in a wide variety of biological processes. Disruption of this coupling can lead to diseases, and therefore there is a need to accurately measure mechanochemical coupling in motors in both health and disease. Optical tweezers, with nanometer spatial and millisecond temporal resolution, have provided valuable insights into these processes. However, fluctuations due to Brownian motion can make it difficult to precisely resolve these conformational changes. One powerful analysis technique that has improved our ability to accurately measure mechanochemical coupling in motor proteins is ensemble averaging of individual trajectories. Here, we present a user-friendly computational tool, Software for Precise Analysis of Single Molecules (SPASM), for generating ensemble averages of single-molecule data. This tool utilizes several conceptual advances, including optimized procedures for identifying single-molecule interactions and the implementation of a change point algorithm, to more precisely resolve molecular transitions. Using both simulated and experimental data, we demonstrate that these advances allow for accurate determination of the mechanics and kinetics of the myosin working stroke with a smaller set of data. Importantly, we provide our open source MATLAB-based program with a graphical user interface that enables others to readily apply these advances to the analysis of their own data.\n\nStatement of SignificanceSingle molecule optical trapping experiments have given unprecedented insights into the mechanisms of molecular machines. Analysis of these experiments is often challenging because Brownian motion-induced fluctuations introduce noise that can obscure molecular motions. A powerful technique for analyzing these noisy traces is ensemble averaging of individual binding interactions, which can uncover information about the mechanics and kinetics of molecular motions that are typically obscured by Brownian motion. Here, we provide an open source, easy-to-use computational tool, SPASM, with a graphical user interface for ensemble averaging of single molecule data. This computational tool utilizes several conceptual advances that significantly improve the accuracy and resolution of ensemble averages, enabling the generation of high-resolution averages from a smaller number of binding interactions.",

    "abstract": "Over 300 BRAF missense mutations have been identified in patients, yet currently approved drugs target V600 mutants alone. Moreover, acquired resistance inevitably emerges, primarily due to RAF lesions that prevent inhibition of BRAF V600 with current treatments. Therefore, there is a need for new therapies that target other mechanisms of activated BRAF. In this study, we use the Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) technology, which promotes ubiquitination and degradation of neo-substrates, to address the limitations of BRAF inhibitor-based therapies. Using vemurafenib-based PROTACs, we successfully achieve sub-nanomolar degradation of all classes of BRAF mutants, but spare degradation of WT RAF family members. Our lead PROTAC outperforms vemurafenib in inhibiting cancer cell growth and shows in vivo efficacy in a Class 2 BRAF xenograft model. Mechanistic studies reveal that BRAFWT is spared due to weak ternary complex formation in cells owing to its quiescent inactivated conformation, and activation of BRAFWT sensitizes it to degradation. This study highlights the degree of selectivity achievable using degradation-based therapies by targeting mutant BRAF-driven cancers while sparing BRAFWT and thus expanding the therapeutic window using a new anti-tumor drug modality.",

While infiltrating immune cells also rely on glucose, disruptions to metabolism can contribute to tumor immunological evasion5-9. How immune cell metabolism is programmed or restrained by competition with cancer cells for nutrients, remains uncertain. Here we used PET tracers to measure the accessibility of glucose and glutamine to cell subsets in the TME. Surprisingly, myeloid cells including macrophages were the greatest consumers of intra-tumoral glucose, followed by T cells and cancer cells. Cancer cells, in contrast, had the highest glutamine uptake. This distinct nutrient partitioning was programmed through selective mTORC1 signaling and glucose or glutamine-related gene expression. Inhibition of glutamine uptake enhanced glucose uptake across tumor resident cell types and shifted macrophage phenotype, demonstrating glucose is not limiting in the TME. Thus, cancer cells are not the only cells in tumors which exhibit high glucose uptake in vivo and instead preferentially utilize glutamine over other cell types. We observe that intrinsic cellular programs can play a major role in the use of some nutrients. Together, these data argue cell selective partitioning of glucose and glutamine can be exploited to develop therapies and imaging strategies to alter the metabolic programs of specific cell populations in the TME.",

    "abstract": "The wheat curl mite (WCM)-transmissible wheat streak disease complex is the most serious disease of wheat in the U.S. Great Plains. In the current study, we determined the genetic variability in WCM and mite-transmitted viruses in Colorado and identified sources of resistance in Colorado wheat germplasm to wheat streak disease complex. We identified two distinct genotypes of WCM, Type 1 and Type 2 based on the ribosomal ITS1 region. Both genotypes were found to co-exist throughout the wheat producing regions of Colorado. Analysis of the whole genome and partial coat protein sequences revealed rich diversity of wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) and High Plains wheat mosaic virus (HPWMoV) isolates collected from Colorado, whereas triticum mosaic virus (TriMV) showed low sequence variability. Analysis of WSMV isolates revealed two novel isolates and one that was 100% similar to a new variant of WSMV from Kansas. Interestingly, between 2-4 genotypes of all 8 RNA segments of HPWMoV were identified, which suggests new variants of emaraviruses and co-occurrence of multiple strains within host populations. Several novel viruses including mycoviruses were identified for the first time in Colorado. We found variation in WSMV resistance among wheat varieties; however a variety that harbored dual resistance to mite and WSMV had lower virus titer compared to varieties that contained single resistance gene. This suggests that pyramiding genes will ensure improved and durable resistance. Future research may be aimed at elucidating the dynamics, diversity, and distribution of the new WSMV and HPWMoV isolates and their responses to wheat genotypes.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for COVID-19, resulting in the largest pandemic in over a hundred years. After examining the molecular structures and activities of hepatitis C viral inhibitors and comparing hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, we previously postulated that the FDA-approved hepatitis C drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) might inhibit SARS-CoV-2.1 We subsequently demonstrated that Sofosbuvir triphosphate is incorporated by the relatively low fidelity SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps), serving as an immediate polymerase reaction terminator, but not by a host-like high fidelity DNA polymerase.2,3 Other investigators have since demonstrated the ability of Sofosbuvir to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung and brain cells;4,5 additionally, COVID-19 clinical trials with EPCLUSA6 and with Sofosbuvir plus Daclatasvir7 have been initiated in several countries. SARS-CoV-2 has an exonuclease-based proofreader to maintain the viral genome integrity.8 Any effective antiviral targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp must display a certain level of resistance to this proofreading activity. We report here that Sofosbuvir terminated RNA resists removal by the exonuclease to a substantially higher extent than RNA terminated by Remdesivir, another drug being used as a COVID-19 therapeutic. These results offer a molecular basis supporting the current use of Sofosbuvir in combination with other drugs in COVID-19 clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Acute ventricular dilation can evoke mechanically-induced arrhythmias, our study investigated whether Purkinje fibres (PFs) may play a role. Changes in left ventricular (LV) pressure and pseudo-ECGs were measured in isolated, Langendorff-perfused, male Wistar rat hearts in sinus rhythm. The LV endocardial surface was irrigated with experimental agents, via an indwelling catheter. Mechanically-induced arrhythmias were triggered by LV lumen inflation (100l in 2s) via an indwelling balloon. Arrhythmias occurred as the LV volume was increased and spontaneously ceased within 20s of the onset of LV inflation. Arrhythmias were indexed as an increase in the standard deviation of all R-R intervals (SDRR), the number of ectopic activations and the period of these activations. Following 10s LV endocardial irrigation with Lugols solution (IK/I2) to chemically ablate surface PFs or with 0 Na+ Tyrode, there was a statistically significant attenuation of mechanically-induced arrhythmias. Lugols reduced the mechanically-induced increase in SDRR (Tyrode pre-stretch 3.5{+/-}1.7ms to 113.8{+/-}15.1ms during stretch vs Lugol pre-stretch 3.3{+/-}0.5ms to 39.9{+/-}14.5ms during stretch n=8, P < 0.05). There was also a reduction in the number (21.2{+/-}2.0 to 1.5{+/-}0.7, P<0.001) and period (5.9{+/-}0.71s to 1.7{+/-}0.85s, P< 0.01) of ectopic activations. The experiment was repeated using LV lumen irrigation with either 1{micro}M GsMTx4, a peptide that blocks stretch-activated channels or 50{micro}M 9-Phenanthrol (9-Phen), a blocker of TRPM4 channels. GsMTx4 did not attenuate mechanically-activated arrhythmias while 9-Phen had a partial effect. 9-Phen statistically reduced the number and period of ectopic activations but did not attenuate the mechanically-induced increase in SDRR (n=6-11 for each intervention). In further studies, in situ focal mechanical stimulation of individual PFs, caused ectopic activations, in each of 4 sheep LV preparations (0.2{+/-}0.1 ectopics in 10s pre-mechanical stimulation vs 2.1{+/-}0.2 ectopics in 10s during mechanical stimulation, P<0.001). We interpret our observations in rat and sheep hearts as evidence for a role of PFs in the generation of some mechanically-induced arrhythmia.",

    "abstract": "Plant-unique receptor kinases harbor conserved cytoplasmic kinase domains and sequence-diverse ectodomains. Here we report crystal structures of CRINKLY4-type ectodomains from Arabidopsis ACR4 and Physcomitrella patens PpCR4 at 1.95 [A] and 2.70 [A] resolution, respectively. Monomeric CRINKLY4 ectodomains harbor a N-terminal WD40 domain and a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) connected by a short linker. The WD40 domain forms a seven-bladed {beta}-propeller with the N-terminal strand buried in its center. Each propeller blade is stabilized by a disulfide bond and contributes to the formation of a putative ligand binding groove. The CRD forms a {beta}-sandwich structure stabilized by six disulfide bonds and shares low structural homology with tumor necrosis factor receptor domains. Quantitative binding assays reveal that ACR4 is not a direct receptor for the peptide hormone CLE40. An ACR4 variant lacking the entire CRD can rescue the known acr4-2 mutant phenotype, as can expression of PpCR4. Together, an evolutionary conserved signaling function for CRINKLY4 receptor kinases is encoded in its WD40 domain.",

    "abstract": "Many of the gene regulatory processes of Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest malaria parasite, remain poorly understood. To develop a comprehensive guide for exploring this organisms gene regulatory network, we generated a system-level model of Plasmodium falciparum gene regulation using a well-validated, machine-learning approach for predicting interactions between transcription regulators and their targets. The resulting network accurately predicts expression levels of transcriptionally coherent gene regulatory programs in independent transcriptomic data sets from parasites collected by different research groups in diverse laboratory and field settings. Thus, our results indicate that our gene regulatory model has predictive power and utility as a hypothesis-generating tool for illuminating clinically relevant gene regulatory mechanisms within Plasmodium falciparum. Using the set of regulatory programs we identified, we also investigated correlates of artemisinin resistance based on gene expression coherence. We report that resistance is associated with incoherent expression across many regulatory programs, including those controlling genes associated with erythrocyte-host engagement. These results suggest that parasite populations with reduced artemisinin sensitivity are more transcriptionally heterogenous. This pattern is consistent with a model where the parasite utilizes bet-hedging strategies to diversify the population, rendering a subpopulation more able to navigate drug treatment.",

    "abstract": "As a cornerstone of biodiversity science, Linnaean taxonomy has been used for almost 300 years to catalogue and organize our knowledge of the living world. In this system, the names of species themselves take on additional functions, such as describing features of the organism or honoring individuals. Here, we analyze the connections between bird species descriptions and who they honor from 1950 to 2019 within a context of global structures of power and access to science to interrogate how authority over the natural world is designated through Western scientific naming practices. We find that 95% of bird species described during this period occur in the Global South, but these species are disproportionately described by and named in honor of individuals from the Global North. We also find an increase through time in authors from the Global South, but Global North authors continue to disproportionately hold first author positions. Our findings show how research and labor in the Global South continue to be disproportionately translated into power and authority in the Global North, upholding and re-enacting imperialistic structures of domination. Addressing these inequities as a scientific community will require reflection and collective dialogue on the social foundations and impacts of our science.\n\nFor working definitions of key terms, see Table 1.
