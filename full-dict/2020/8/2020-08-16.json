    "abstract": "High quality metadata annotations for data hosted in large public repositories are essential for research reproducibility, and for conducting fast, powerful and scalable meta-analyses. Currently, a majority of sequencing samples in the National Center for Biotechnology Informations (NCBIs) Sequence Read Archive (SRA) are missing metadata across several categories. In an effort to improve the metadata coverage of these samples, we leveraged almost 44 million attribute-value pairs from SRA BioSample to train a scalable, recurrent neural network that predicts missing metadata via Named Entity Recognition (NER). The network was first trained to classify short text phrases according to 11 metadata categories and achieved an overall accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of 85.2% and 0.977 respectively. We then applied our classifier to predict 11 metadata categories from the longer TITLE attribute of samples, evaluating performance on a set of samples withheld from model training. Prediction accuracies were high when extracting sample Species (94.85%), Condition/Disease (95.65%) and Strain (82.03%) from TITLEs, with lower accuracies and lack of predictions for other categories highlighting multiple issues with the current metadata annotations in BioSample. These results indicate the utility of recurrent neural networks for NER-based metadata prediction and the potential for models such as the one presented here to increase metadata coverage in BioSample while minimizing the need for manual curation.\n\nAvailabilityAll the analyses, environments, and Jupyter notebooks pertaining to this manuscript are available on Github: https://github.com/cartercompbio/PredictMEE.",

    "abstract": "Heterochromatin is a critical chromatin compartment, whose integrity governs genome stability and cell fate transitions. How heterochromatin features, including higher-order chromatin folding and histone modifications associated with transcriptional silencing, are maintained following a genotoxic stress challenge is unknown. Here, we establish a system for targeting UV damage to pericentric heterochromatin in mammalian cells and for tracking the heterochromatin response to UV in real time. We uncover profound heterochromatin compaction changes during repair, orchestrated by the UV damage sensor DDB2, which stimulates linker histone displacement from chromatin. Despite massive heterochromatin unfolding, heterochromatin-specific histone modifications and transcriptional silencing are maintained. We unveil a central role for the methyltransferase SETDB1 in the maintenance of heterochromatic histone marks after UV, SETDB1 coordinating histone methylation with new histone deposition in damaged heterochromatin, thus protecting cells from genome instability. Our data shed light on fundamental molecular mechanisms safeguarding higher-order chromatin integrity following DNA damage.",

    "abstract": "Domestication is anthropogenic evolution that fulfills mankinds critical food demand. As such, elucidating the molecular mechanisms behind this process promotes the development of future new food resources including crops. With the aim of understanding the long-term domestication process of Asian rice and by employing the Oryza sativa subspecies (indica and japonica) as an Asian rice domestication model, we scrutinized past genomic introgressions between them as traces of domestication. Here we show the genome-wide introgressive region (IR) map of Asian rice, by utilizing 4,587 accession genotypes with a stable outgroup species, particularly at the finest resolution through a machine learning-aided method. The IR map revealed that 14.2% of the rice genome consists of IRs, including both wide IRs (recent) and narrow IRs (ancient). This introgressive landscape with their time calibration indicates that introgression events happened in multiple genomic regions over multiple periods. From the correspondence between our wide IRs and the so-called selective sweep regions, we provide a definitive answer to a long-standing controversy over the evolutionary origin of Asian rice domestication, single or multiple origins: It heavily depends upon which regions you pay attention to, implying that wider genomic regions represent immediate short history of Asian rice domestication as a likely support to the single origin, while its ancient history is interspersed in narrower traces throughout the genome as a possible support to the multiple origin.",

    "abstract": "Healthy aging can be promoted by enhancing metabolic fitness and physical capacity (1, 2). Mitochondria are chief metabolic organelles with strong implications in aging (3-8). In addition to their prominent role in bioenergetics, mitochondria also coordinate broad physiological functions by communicating to other cellular compartments or distal cells using multiple factors (9, 10), including peptides that are encoded within their own independent genome (11, 12). However, it is unknown if aging is actively regulated by factors encoded in the mitochondrial genome. MOTS-c is a mitochondrial-encoded peptide that regulates metabolic homeostasis (13, 14), in part, by translocating to the nucleus to regulate adaptive nuclear gene expression in response to cellular stress (15-17). Here, we report that MOTS-c is an exercise-induced mitochondrial-encoded peptide that significantly enhanced physical performance when administered to young (2 mo.), middle-aged (12 mo.), and old (22 mo.) mice. In humans, we found that endogenous MOTS-c levels significantly increased in response to exercise in skeletal muscle (11.9-fold) and in circulation (1.5-fold). Systemic MOTS-c treatment in mice significantly enhanced the performance on a treadmill of all age groups (~2-fold). MOTS-c regulated (i) nuclear genes, including those related to metabolism and protein homeostasis, (ii) glucose and amino acid metabolism in skeletal muscle, and (iii) myoblast adaptation to metabolic stress. Late-life (23.5 mo.) initiated intermittent MOTS-c treatment (3x/week) improved physical capacity and trended towards increasing lifespan. Our data indicate that aging is regulated by genes that are encoded not only in the nuclear genome (18, 19), but also in the mitochondrial genome. Considering that aging is the major risk factor for multiple chronic diseases (20, 21), our study provides new grounds for further investigation into mitochondrial-encoded regulators of healthy lifespan.",

However, the biomedical data inequality between different racial and ethnic groups is set to generate new health care disparities through data-driven, algorithm-based biomedical research and clinical decisions. Using an extensive set of machine learning experiments on cancer omics data, we found that current prevalent schemes of multiethnic machine learning are prone to generating significant model performance disparities between racial groups. We showed that these performance disparities are caused by data inequality and data distribution discrepancies between racial groups. We also found that transfer learning can improve machine learning model performance for data-disadvantaged racial groups, and thus provides a novel approach to reduce health care disparities arising from data inequality among racial groups.",

Therefore, we inducibly depleted ScxLin cells (ScxLinDTR) prior to tendon injury and repair surgery and hypothesized that ScxLinDTR mice would exhibit functionally deficient healing compared to wildtype littermates. Surprisingly, depletion of ScxLin cells resulted in increased biomechanical properties without impairments in gliding function at 28 days post-repair, indicative of regeneration. RNA sequencing of day 28 post-repair tendons highlighted differences in matrix-related genes, cell motility, cytoskeletal organization, and metabolism. We also utilized ScxLinDTR mice to define the effects on post-natal tendon growth and adult tendon homeostasis and discovered that adult ScxLin cell depletion resulted in altered tendon collagen fibril diameter, density, and dispersion. Collectively, these findings enhance our fundamental understanding of tendon cell localization, function, and fate during healing, growth, and homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in temperate zones and a growing public health threat in the United States (US). The life cycles of the tick vectors and spirochete pathogen are highly sensitive to climate, but determining the impact of climate change on Lyme disease burden has been challenging due to the complex ecology of the disease and the presence of multiple, interacting drivers of transmission. Here we incorporated 18 years of annual, county-level Lyme disease case data in a panel data statistical model to investigate prior effects of climate variation on disease incidence while controlling for other putative drivers. We then used these climate-disease relationships to project Lyme disease cases using CMIP5 global climate models and two potential climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). We find that interannual variation in Lyme disease incidence is associated with climate variation in all US regions encompassing the range of the primary vector species. In all regions, the climate predictors explained less of the variation in Lyme disease incidence than unobserved county-level heterogeneity, but the strongest climate-disease association detected was between warming annual temperatures and increasing incidence in the Northeast. Lyme disease projections indicate that cases in the Northeast will increase significantly by 2050 (23,619 {+/-} 21,607 additional cases), but only under RCP8.5, and with large uncertainty around this projected increase. Significant case changes are not projected for any other region under either climate scenario. The results demonstrate a regionally variable and nuanced relationship between climate change and Lyme disease, indicating possible nonlinear responses of vector ticks and transmission dynamics to projected climate change. Moreover, our results highlight the need for improved preparedness and public health interventions in endemic regions to minimize the impact of further climate change-induced increases in Lyme disease burden.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMosquitoes transmit filarial nematodes to both human and animal hosts, resulting in worldwide health and economic consequences. Transmission to a vertebrate host requires that ingested microfilariae develop into infective third-stage larvae capable of emerging from the mosquito proboscis onto the skin of the host during blood feeding. Determining the number of microfilariae that successfully develop to infective third-stage larvae in the mosquito host is key to understanding parasite transmission potential and to developing new strategies to block these worms in their vector.\n\nMethodsWe developed a novel method to efficiently assess the number of infective third-stage filarial larvae that emerge from experimentally infected mosquitoes. Following infection, individual mosquitoes were placed in wells of a multi-well culture plate and warmed to 37 {degrees}C to stimulate parasite emergence. Aedes aegypti infected with Dirofilaria immitis were used to determine infection conditions and assay timing. The assay was also tested with Brugia malayi infected Ae. aegypti.\n\nResultsApproximately 30% of Ae. aegypti infected with D. immitis and 50% of those infected with B. malayi produce emerging third-stage larvae. Once D. immitis third-stage larvae emerge at 13 days post infection, the proportion of mosquitoes producing them, and the number produced per mosquito remain stable until at least day 21. The prevalence and intensity of emerging third-stage B. malayi were similar on days 12-14 days post infection. Increased uptake of D. immitis microfilariae increases the fitness cost to the mosquito but does not increase the number of emerging third-stage larvae.\n\nConclusionsWe provide a new assay with an associated set of infection conditions that will facilitate assessment of the filarial transmission potential of mosquito vectors and promote preparation of uniformly infectious L3 for functional assays. The ability to quantify infection outcome will facilitate analyses of molecular interactions between vectors and filariae, ultimately allowing for the establishment of novel methods to block disease transmission.\n\nGraphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHibernation is a physiological and behavioural adaptation that permits survival during periods of reduced food availability and extreme environmental temperatures. This is achieved through cycles of metabolic depression and reduced body temperature (torpor) and rewarming (arousal). Rewarming from torpor is achieved through the activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) associated with a rapid increase in ventilation frequency. Here, we studied the rate of rewarming in the European hamster (Cricetus cricetus) by measuring both BAT temperature, core body temperature and ventilation frequency.\n\nResultsTemperature was monitored in parallel in the BAT (IPTT tags) and peritoneal cavity (iButtons) during hibernation torpor-arousal cycling. We found that increases in brown fat temperature preceded core body temperature rises by about 48 min, with a maximum re-warming rate of 20.9{degrees}C*h-1. Re-warming was accompanied by a significant increase in ventilation frequency. The rate of rewarming was slowed by the presence of a spontaneous thoracic mass in one of our animals. Core body temperature re-warming was reduced by 6.2{degrees}C*h-1 and BAT rewarming by 12{degrees}C*h-1. Ventilation frequency was increased by 77% during re-warming in the affected animal compared to a healthy animal. Inspection of the position and size of the mass indicated it was obstructing the lungs and heart.\n\nConclusionsWe have used a minimally invasive method to monitor BAT temperature during arousal from hibernation illustrating BAT re-warming significantly precedes core body temperature re-warming, informing future study design on arousal from hibernation. We also showed compromised re-warming from hibernation in an animal with a mass obstructing the lungs and heart, likely leading to inefficient ventilation and circulation.",

MP subtypes play distinct functional roles in steady state and inflammatory conditions. Though murine MPs are well characterized, their pulmonary and lymph node (LN) human homologs remain poorly understood. To address this gap, we created a gene expression compendium across 15 distinct human and 9 distinct murine MPs from lung, LN, blood, and spleen. Human blood MPs and murine spleen MPs served as validation datasets, as the human-mouse MP homologs are relatively well-defined in these tissues. In-depth RNA sequencing identified corresponding human-mouse MP subtypes and determined marker genes shared and divergent across between species counterparts. Unexpectedly, at the gene expression level, only 13-23% of the top 1000 marker genes (i.e., genes not shared across species-specific MP subtypes) overlapped in corresponding human-mouse MP counterparts, indicating a need for caution when translating mouse studies to human gene targets and functions. Lastly, CD88 was useful in both species to distinguish macrophage and tissue monocytes from DCs. Our cross-species gene expression compendium serves as a resource for future translational studies to investigate beforehand whether pursuing specific MP subtypes, or genes will prove fruitful.",

    "abstract": "As animals carry out behaviors, particularly costly ones, they must constantly assess whether or not to persist in the behavior or quit. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) has been shown to assess the value of behaviors and to be especially sensitive to physical effort costs. Complimentary to these functions, the insula is thought to represent the internal state of the animal including factors such as hunger, thirst, and fatigue. Utilizing a novel weight lifting task for rats, we characterized the local field potential (LFP) activity of the ACC and anterior insula (AI) during effort expenditure. In the task male rats are challenged to work for sucrose reward, which costs progressively more effort over time to obtain. Rats are able to quit the task at any point. We found modest shifts in LFP theta (7-9 Hz) activity as the task got progressively more difficult in terms of absolute effort expenditure. However, when the LFP data were analyzed based on the rats relative progress towards quitting the task, or performance state, substantial shifts in LFP power in the theta and gamma (55-100 Hz) frequency bands were observed in ACC and AI. Both ACC and AI theta power decreased as the rats got closer to quitting, while ACC and AI gamma power increased. Furthermore, coherency between ACC and AI in the delta (2-4 Hz) range shifted alongside the rats performance state. Overall we show that ACC and AI LFP activity changes correlate to the rats relative performance state in an effort-based task.\n\nSignificance StatementAnimals need to assess whether or not a behavior is worth pursuing based on their internal states (e.g., hunger, fatigue) and the costs and benefits of the behavior. However, internal states often change as behaviors are carried out, such as becoming fatigued, necessitating constant reassessment as to whether to continue the behavior or quit. We characterized brain activity in the anterior cingulate cortex and insula, brain regions involved in cost-benefit decision making and internal state representations, respectively, as rats carried out a challenging physical-effort task. Both brain regions showed significant shifts in activity as the rats approached their quitting point. Our study provides one of the first characterizations of neural activity as an animal decides to quit an effortful task.",

The same reaction products can then be used in a highly multiplexed sequencing-based assay in Stage 2, confirming the near-patient testing results and facilitating centralised data collection. Based on experiments using commercially acquired human saliva with spiked-in viral RNA as input, the INSIGHT platform gives Stage 1 results within one to two hours, using either fluorescence detection or a lateral flow (dipstick) readout, whilst simultaneously incorporating sample-specific barcodes into the amplification product. INSIGHT Stage 2 can be performed by directly pooling and sequencing all post-amplification barcoded Stage 1 products from hundreds of thousands of samples with minimal sample preparation steps. The 95% limit of detection (LoD-95) for INSIGHT is estimated to be below 50 copies of viral RNA per 20 l of reaction. Our two-stage testing strategy is suitable for further development into a rapid home-based and point-of-care assay, and is potentially scalable to the population level.",

    "abstract": "Inhibition plays important roles in modulating the neural activities of sensory and motor systems at different levels from synapses to brain regions. To achieve coordinated movement, motor systems produce alternating contraction of antagonist muscles, whether along the body axis or within and among limbs. In the nematode C. elegans, a small network involving excitatory cholinergic and inhibitory GABAergic motoneurons generates the dorsoventral alternation of body-wall muscles that supports undulatory locomotion. Inhibition has been suggested to be necessary for backward undulation because mutants that are defective in GABA transmission exhibit a shrinking phenotype in response to a harsh touch to the head, whereas wild-type animals produce a backward escape response. Here, we demonstrate that the shrinking phenotype is exhibited by wild-type as well as mutant animals in response to harsh touch to the head or tail, but only GABA transmission mutants show slow locomotion after stimulation. Impairment of GABA transmission, either genetically or optogenetically, induces lower undulation frequency and lower translocation speed during crawling and swimming in both directions. The activity patterns of GABAergic motoneurons are different during low and high undulation frequencies. During low undulation frequency, GABAergic VD and DD motoneurons show similar activity patterns, while during high undulation frequency, their activity alternates. The experimental results suggest at least three non-mutually exclusive roles for inhibition that could underlie fast undulatory locomotion in C. elegans, which we tested with computational models: cross-inhibition or disinhibition of body-wall muscles, or inhibitory reset.\n\nSignificance StatementInhibition serves multiple roles in the generation, maintenance, and modulation of the locomotive program and supports the alternating activation of antagonistic muscles. When the locomotor frequency increases, more inhibition is required. To better understand the role of inhibition in locomotion, we used C. elegans as an animal model, and challenged a prevalent hypothesis that cross-inhibition supports the dorsoventral alternation. We find that inhibition is related to the speed rather than the direction of locomotion and demonstrate that inhibition is unnecessary for muscle alternation during slow undulation in either direction but crucial to sustain rapid dorsoventral alternation. We combined calcium imaging of motoneurons and muscle with computational models to test hypotheses for the role of inhibition in locomotion.",

    "abstract": "Many species of terrestrial animals, including primates, live in varied association with the aquatic (e.g., riverine or coastal) environment. However, the benefits that each species receive from the aquatic environment are thought to vary depending on their social and ecological characteristics, and thus, elucidating those benefits to each species is important for understanding the principles of wild animal behaviour. In the present study, to gain a more complete picture of aquatic environment use, including social and ecological factors in primates, factors affecting riverine habitat utilization of two macaque species (Macaca nemestrina and M. fascicularis) were identified and qualitative comparisons were made with sympatric proboscis monkeys (Nasalis larvatus), which have different social and ecological characteristics. Temporal variation in sighting frequency of macaques at the riverbanks was positively related to the fruit availability of a dominant riparian plant species and negatively related to the river water level which affects the extent of predation pressure. Riverine utilization of macaques was greatly influenced by distribution and abundance of food (especially fruit) resources, possibly in association with predation pressure. Additionally, qualitative ecological comparisons with sympatric proboscis monkeys suggest that the drivers of riverine utilization depend on the feeding niches of the species, and different anti-predator strategies resulting from their differing social structures.",

As other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is enveloped, replicates in the cytoplasm and assembles at intracellular membranes. Here, we structurally characterize the viral replication compartment and report critical insights into the budding mechanism of the virus, and the structure of extracellular virions close to their native state by in situ cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging. We directly visualized RNA filaments inside the double membrane vesicles, compartments associated with viral replication. The RNA filaments show a diameter consistent with double-stranded RNA and frequent branching likely representing RNA secondary structures. We found that assembled S trimers in lumenal cisternae do not alone induce membrane bending but laterally reorganize on the envelope during virion assembly. The viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs) are accumulated at the curved membrane characteristic for budding sites suggesting that vRNP recruitment is enhanced by membrane curvature. Subtomogram averaging shows that vRNPs are distinct cylindrical assemblies. We propose that the genome is packaged around multiple separate vRNP complexes, thereby allowing incorporation of the unusually large coronavirus genome into the virion while maintaining high steric flexibility between the vRNPs.",

We conducted comparative analysis of publicly available whole-genome sequences of 64 SARS-CoV-2 isolates in Bangladesh and 371 isolates from another 27 countries to predict possible transmission routes of COVID19 to Bangladesh and genomic variations among the viruses. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the pathogen was imported in Bangladesh from multiple countries. The viruses found in the southern district of Chattogram were closely related to strains from Saudi Arabia whereas those in Dhaka were similar to that of United Kingdom and France. The 64 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Bangladesh belonged to three clusters. Compared to the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 sequence reported from China, the isolates in Bangladesh had a total of 180 mutations in the coding region of the genome, and 110 of these were missense. Among these, 99 missense mutations (90%) were predicted to destabilize protein structures. Remarkably, a mutation that leads to an I300F change in the nsp2 protein and a mutation leading to D614G change in the spike protein were prevalent in SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences, and might have influenced the epidemiological properties of the virus in Bangladesh.",

    "abstract": "New therapies against hepatitis B virus (HBV) require the elimination of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), the episomal HBV genome. HBV plasmids containing an overlength 1.3-mer genome and bacterial backbone (pHBV1.3) are used in many different models, but do not replicate the unique features of cccDNA. Since the stable cccDNA pool is a barrier to HBV eradication in patients, we developed a recombinant circular HBV genome (rcccDNA) to mimic the cccDNA using Cre/LoxP technology. We validated four LoxP insertion sites into the HBV genome using hydrodynamic tail vein injection into murine liver, demonstrating high levels of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBV DNA expression with rcccDNA formation. HBsAg expression from rcccDNA was >30,000 ng/mL over 78 days, while HBsAg-expression from pHBV1.3 plasmid DNA declined from 2,753 ng/mL to 131 ng/mL over that time in immunodeficient mice (P<0.001), reflective of plasmid DNA silencing. We then cloned Cre-recombinase in cis on the LoxP-HBV plasmids, achieving plasmid stability in bacteria with intron insertion into Cre and demonstrating rcccDNA formation after transfection in vitro and in vivo. These cis-Cre/LoxP-HBV plasmids were then used to create HBx-mutant and GFP reporter plasmids to further probe cccDNA biology and antiviral strategies against cccDNA. Overall, we believe these auto-generating rcccDNA plasmids will be of great value to model cccDNA for testing new therapies against HBV infection.",

Planting trees may strongly impact microorganisms in particular at unfavorable site conditions, compromising the functioning of soil microorganisms. To understand the effects of tree species composition on soil microorganisms, we quantified structural and functional responses of soil microorganisms to forest types across environmental conditions using substrate-induced respiration and phospholipid fatty acid analyses. Five forest types were studied including pure stands of native European beech (Fagus sylvatica), range expanding Norway spruce (Picea abies), and non-native Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), as well as the two conifer - beech mixtures. We found that microbial functioning strongly depends on site conditions, in particular on soil nutrients. At nutrient-poor sites, soil microorganisms were more stressed in pure and mixed coniferous forests, especially in Douglas-fir, compared to beech forests. By contrast, microbial structure and functional indicators in beech forests varied little with site conditions, likely because beech provided high amounts of root-derived resources for microbial growth. Since soil microbial communities are sensitive to Douglas-fir, planting Douglas-fir may compromise ecosystem functioning in particular at nutrient-poor sites. Overall, root-derived resources are important for determining the structure and functioning of soil microbial communities, and soil microorganisms sensitively respond to plantations containing tree species that may differ in the provisioning of these resources.",

As only very limited therapeutic options are clinically available, there is an urgent need for the rapid development of safe, effective, and globally available pharmaceuticals that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry and ameliorate COVID-19. In this study, we explored the use of small compounds acting on the homeostasis of the endolysosomal host-pathogen interface, to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection. We find that fluoxetine, a widely used antidepressant and a functional inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase (FIASMA), efficiently inhibited the entry and propagation of SARS-CoV-2 in the cell culture model without cytotoxic effects and also exerted potent antiviral activity against two currently circulating influenza A virus subtypes, an effect which was also observed upon treatment with the FIASMAs amiodarone and imipramine. Mechanistically, fluoxetine induced both impaired endolysosomal acidification and the accumulation of cholesterol within the endosomes. As the FIASMA group consists of a large number of small compounds that are well-tolerated and widely used for a broad range of clinical applications, exploring these licensed pharmaceuticals may offer a variety of promising antivirals for host-directed therapy to counteract enveloped viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and COVID 19.",

Furthermore, PRMT5 modulates protein kinase B (AKT) activation by methylation of AKT1 Arg 15, which is required for its subsequent phosphorylation at AKT1 Thr 308 and Ser 473. The PRMT5/EGFR/AKT axis converges to regulate transcription factors ZEB1, SNAIL, and TWIST1 to promote the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), in the manner that EGFR and AKT1 compensate each other to support tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Inhibiting PRMT5 methyltransferase activity with a small molecule inhibitor attenuated primary tumor growth and prevented hepatic metastasis in aggressive in vivo tumor models.

Here, we report the development of an approach to evaluate the ability of recombinant E3 ligase components to support neo-substrate degradation. Bypassing the need for hit finding to identify specific E3 ligase binders, this approach makes use of simple chemistry for Covalent Functionalization Followed by E3 Electroporation into live cells (COFFEE). We demonstrate this method by electroporating recombinant VHL, covalently functionalized with JQ1 or dasatinib, to induce degradation of BRD4 or kinase targets, respectively. Furthermore, by applying COFFEE to SPSB2, a SOCS box and SPRY-domain E3 ligase that has not previously been redirected for targeted protein degradation, we validate this method as a powerful approach to define the activity of previously uncharacterized ubiquitin ligases against neo-substrates.",

The presence of Cap-1 makes viral RNAs mimic the host transcripts and prevents their degradation. To investigate the 2'-O methyltransferase activity of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp10/16, we applied fixed-target serial synchrotron crystallography (SSX) which allows for physiological temperature data collection from thousands of crystals, significantly reducing the x-ray dose while maintaining a biologically relevant temperature. We determined crystal structures of Nsp10/16 that revealed the states before and after the methylation reaction, for the first time illustrating coronavirus Nsp10/16 complexes with the m7GpppAm2'-O Cap-1, where 2'OH of ribose is methylated. We compare these structures with structures of Nsp10/16 at 297 K and 100 K collected from a single crystal.

    "abstract": "The human corpus callosum exhibits substantial atrophy in old age, which is stronger than what would be predicted from parallel changes in overall brain anatomy. To date, however, it has not been conclusively established whether this accentuated decline represents a common feature of brain aging across species, or whether it is a specific characteristic of the aging human brain. In the present cross-sectional study, we address this question by comparing age-related difference in corpus callosum morphology of chimpanzees and humans. For this purpose, we measured total midsagittal area and regional thickness of the corpus callosum from T1-weighted MRI data from 213 chimpanzees, aged between 9 and 54 years. The results were compared with data drawn from a large-scale human samples which was age-range matched using two strategies: (a) matching by chronological age (human sample size: n = 562), or (b) matching by accounting for differences in longevity and various maturational events between the species (i.e., adjusted human age range: 13.6 to 80.9 years; n = 664). Using generalized additive modelling to fit and compare aging trajectories, we found significant differences between the two species. The chimpanzee aging trajectory compared to the human trajectory was characterized by a slower increase from adolescence to middle adulthood, and by a lack of substantial decline from middle to old adulthood, which, however, was present in humans. Thus, the accentuated decline of the corpus callosum found in aging humans, is not an universal characteristic of the aging brain, and appears to be human-specific.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus is a brain area central for cognition. Mutations in the human SOX2 transcription factor cause neurodevelopmental defects, leading to intellectual disability and seizures, together with hippocampal dysplasia. We generated an allelic series of Sox2 conditional mutations in mouse, deleting Sox2 at different developmental stages. Late Sox2 deletion (from E11.5, via Nestin-Cre) affects only postnatal hippocampal development; earlier deletion (from E10.5, Emx1-Cre) significantly reduces the dentate gyrus, and the earliest deletion (from E9.5, FoxG1-Cre) causes drastic abnormalities, with almost complete absence of the dentate gyrus. We identify a set of functionally interconnected genes (Gli3, Wnt3a, Cxcr4, p73 and Tbr2), known to play essential roles in hippocampal embryogenesis, which are downregulated in early Sox2 mutants, and (Gli3 and Cxcr4) directly controlled by SOX2; their downregulation provides plausible molecular mechanisms contributing to the defect. Electrophysiological studies of the Emx1Cre mouse model reveal altered excitatory transmission in CA1 and CA3 regions.",

    "abstract": "The phenology of many species shows strong sensitivity to climate change; however, with few large scale intra-specific studies it is unclear how such sensitivity varies over a species range. We document large intra-specific variation in phenological sensitivity to temperature using laying date information from 67 populations of two European songbirds covering a large part of their breeding range. Populations inhabiting deciduous habitats showed stronger phenological sensitivity compared with those in evergreen and mixed habitats. Strikingly, however, the lowest sensitivity was seen in populations that had experienced the greatest change in climate. Therefore, we predict that the strongest phenological advancement will not occur in those populations with the highest sensitivity. Our results show that to effectively assess the impact of climate change on phenology across a species range it will be necessary to account for intra-specific variation in phenological sensitivity, climate change exposure, and the ecological characteristics of a population.",

    "abstract": "Nutritional immunity is an elegant host mechanism used to starve invading pathogens of necessary nutrient metals. Calprotectin, a metal binding protein, is produced abundantly by neutrophils and is found in high concentrations within inflammatory sites during infection. Group B Streptococcus (GBS) colonizes the gastrointestinal and female reproductive tracts and is commonly associated with severe invasive infections in newborns such as pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis. Though GBS infections induce robust neutrophil recruitment and inflammation, the dynamics of GBS and calprotectin interactions remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that disease and colonizing isolate strains exhibit susceptibility to metal starvation by calprotectin. We constructed a mariner transposon (Krmit) mutant library in GBS and identified 258 genes that contribute to surviving calprotectin stress. Nearly 20% of all underrepresented mutants following treatment with calprotectin, are predicted metal transporters, including known zinc systems. As calprotectin binds zinc with picomolar affinity, we investigated the contribution of GBS zinc uptake to overcoming calprotectin-imposed starvation. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed a significant upregulation of genes encoding zinc-binding proteins, adcA, adcAII, and lmb, following calprotectin exposure, while growth in calprotectin revealed a significant defect for a global zinc acquisition mutant ({Delta}adcA{Delta}adcAII{Delta}lmb) compared to the GBS WT strain. Further, mice challenged with the {Delta}adcA{Delta}adcAII{Delta}lmb mutant exhibited decreased mortality and significantly reduced bacterial burden in the brain compared to mice infected with WT GBS; this difference was abrogated in calprotectin knockout mice. Collectively, these data suggest that GBS zinc transport machinery are important for combatting zinc-chelation by calprotectin and establishing invasive disease.\n\nImportanceGBS asymptomatically colonizes the female reproductive tract but is a common causative agent of meningitis. GBS meningitis is characterized by extensive infiltration of neutrophils, carrying high concentrations of calprotectin, a metal chelator. To persist within inflammatory sites and cause invasive disease, GBS must circumvent host starvation attempts. Here, we identified global requirements for GBS survival during calprotectin challenge, including known and putative systems involved in metal ion transport. We characterized the role of zinc import in tolerating calprotectin stress in vitro, and in a mouse model of infection. We observed that a global zinc-uptake mutant was less virulent compared to the parental GBS strain and found calprotectin knockout mice to be equally susceptible to infection by WT and mutant strains. These findings suggest that calprotectin production at the site of infection results in a zinc-limited environment and reveals the importance of GBS metal homeostasis to invasive disease.",

    "abstract": "Using drones to conduct airborne bioacoustic surveys is a potentially useful new way to estimate the abundance of vocal bird species. Here we show that by using two recording devices suspended from a quadcopter drone it is possible to estimate distances to birds with precision. In an experimental test, the mean error of our estimated distances to a broadcast song across 11 points between 0 and 100 m away was just 3.47 m. In field tests we compared 1-minute airborne counts with 5-minute terrestrial counts at 34 count locations. We found that the airborne counts yielded similar data to the terrestrial point counts for most of the 10 the songbirds included in our analysis, and that the effective detection radii were also similar. However, airborne counts significantly under-detected the Northern Cardinal ({chi}29 = 22.8, post-hoc test P = 0.007), which we attribute to a behavioral response to the drone. Airborne counts work best for species that vocalize close to the ground and have high frequency-range songs. Under those circumstances, airborne bioacoustics could have several advantages over ground-based surveys, including increased precision, increased repeatability, and easier access in difficult terrain. Further, we show that it is possible to do rapid surveys using airborne techniques, which could lead to the development of much more efficient survey protocols than are possible using traditional survey techniques.\n\nLay SummaryO_LIWe show that it is possible to estimate the distance of singing birds from a drone, which then allows bird counts to be converted to true abundance or population densities.\nC_LIO_LIUsing drones to count birds allows researchers to survey areas that may be difficult or dangerous to access on foot.\nC_LIO_LIAirborne counts are potentially a highly efficient and highly repeatable way to estimate populations of vocal bird species.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The design and assembly of peptide based materials has advanced considerably, leading to a variety of fibrous, sheet and nanoparticle structures. A remaining challenge is to account for and control different possible supramolecular outcomes accessible to the same or similar peptide building blocks. Here we present a de novo peptide system that forms nanoparticles or sheets depending on the strategic placement of a  disulfide pin between two elements of secondary structure that drive self-assembly. Specifically, we join homodimerizing and homotrimerizing de novo coiled-coil -helices with a flexible linker to generate a series of linear peptides. The helices are pinned back-to-back, constraining them as hairpins by a disulfide bond placed either proximal or distal to the linker. Computational modeling and advanced microscopy show that the proximally pinned hairpins self-assemble into nanoparticles, whereas the distally pinned constructs form sheets. These peptides can be made synthetically or recombinantly to allow both chemical modifications and the introduction of whole protein cargoes as required.",

    "abstract": "Out of millions of ejaculated sperm, only a few reach the fertilization site in mammals. Flagellar Ca2+ signaling nanodomains, organized by multi-subunit CatSper calcium channel complexes, are pivotal for sperm migration in the female tract, implicating CatSper-dependent mechanisms in sperm selection. Here, using biochemical and pharmacological studies, we demonstrate that CatSper1 is an O-linked glycosylated protein, undergoing capacitation-induced processing dependent on Ca2+ and phosphorylation cascades. CatSper1 processing correlates with protein tyrosine phosphorylation (pY) development in sperm cells capacitated in vitro and in vivo. Using 3D in situ molecular imaging and ANN-based automatic detection of sperm distributed along the cleared female tract, we demonstrate that all spermatozoa past the UTJ possess intact CatSper1 signals. Together, we reveal that fertilizing mouse spermatozoa in situ are characterized by intact CatSper channel, lack of pY, and reacted acrosomes. These findings provide molecular insight into sperm selection for successful fertilization in the female reproductive tract.",

    "abstract": "Virtually all SARS-CoV-2 vaccines currently in clinical testing are stored in a refrigerated or frozen state prior to use. This is a major impediment to deployment in resource-poor settings. Several use viral vectors or mRNA. In contrast to protein subunit vaccines, there is limited manufacturing expertise for these novel, nucleic acid based modalities, especially in the developing world. Neutralizing antibodies, the clearest known correlate of protection against SARS-CoV-2, are primarily directed against the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein. We describe a monomeric, glycan engineered RBD protein fragment that is expressed at a purified yield of 214mg/L in unoptimized, mammalian cell culture and in contrast to a stabilized spike ectodomain, is tolerant of exposure to temperatures as high as 100{degrees}C when lyophilized, upto 70{degrees}C in solution and stable for over four weeks at 37{degrees}C. In prime:boost guinea pig immunizations, when formulated with the MF59 like adjuvant AddaVax, the RBD derivative elicited neutralizing antibodies with an endpoint geometric mean titer of ~415 against replicative virus, comparing favourably with several vaccine formulations currently in the clinic. These features of high yield, extreme thermotolerance and satisfactory immunogenicity suggest that such RBD subunit vaccine formulations hold great promise to combat COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "The precise control of bite force and gape is vital for effective breakdown and manipulation of food inside the oral cavity during feeding. Yet the role of the orofacial sensorimotor cortex (OSMcx) in the control of bite force and gape is still largely unknown. The aim of this study was to elucidate how individual neurons and populations of neurons in multiple regions of OSMcx differentially encode bite force and gape when subjects (Macaca mulatta) generated different levels of bite force at varying gapes. We examined neuronal activity recorded simultaneously from three microelectrode arrays implanted chronically in the primary motor (MIo), primary somatosensory (SIo), and cortical masticatory (CMA) areas of OSMcx. We used generalized linear models to evaluate encoding properties of individual neurons and utilized dimensionality reduction techniques to decompose population activity into components related to specific task parameters. Individual neurons encoded bite force more strongly than gape in all three OSMCx areas although bite force was a better predictor of spiking activity in MIo versus SIo. Population activity differentiated between levels of bite force and gape while preserving task-independent temporal modulation across the behavioral trial. While activation patterns of neuronal populations were comparable across OSMCx areas, the total variance explained by task parameters was context-dependent and differed across areas. These findings suggest that the cortical control of gape may rely on computations at the population level whereas the strong encoding of bite force at the individual neuron level allows for the precise and rapid control of bite force.\n\nSignificance StatementBiting a piece off an apple requires precise sensorimotor control and coordination of bite force and gape by multiple brain regions. The cortical representations of bite force and gape by individual neurons and large populations of neurons across connected motor and somatosensory areas in orofacial cortex is unknown. Here we showed that bite force was more strongly encoded than gape by individual neurons in primary motor, somatosensory, and cortical masticatory areas. Moreover, bite force was more effectively represented in motor versus somatosensory cortices. At the population level, bite force and gape were distinguishable particularly when gape was randomized from trial-to-trial. The results are important for understanding neurophysiological processes underlying masticatory dysfunctions that may occur in aging, stroke, and Alzheimers disease.",

    "abstract": "The size of the mammalian cerebrum spans more than 5 orders of magnitude. The smallest cerebrums have a smooth (lissencephalic) cortical surface, which gets increasingly folded (gyrencephalic) with cerebral size. Further, the proportion of white-to-gray matter volume increases with the total volume. These scaling relations have unusually little variation. Even though a number of theories and models have been proposed, it remains an open question, why this is so. Here, we show that almost all variance is explained by assuming a homogeneous composition of the cortex across mammals. On the basis of this assumption we derive quantitative analytical computational models. The first model predicts the cortical surface area from the gray and white matter volume. A single free parameter, for the height of cortical columns is estimated as{lambda} = 2.9 mm (r2 = 0.996). The second model predicts the white matter volume as a function of the gray volume and the cerebral size (with parameters for intra- and extra-gyral connections lint, lext; [Formula]). The models are validated by predicting the effective cortical thickness and the folding parameter{kappa} . The results accurately predict the human intraspecific variation of the surface relations. As expected, we find a reduced{lambda} for cetaceans, and that preterm human infants do not follow the model. We also find deviations of gray and white matter volume for large cerebrums. Overall, the models thus show how the regular architecture of the cortex shapes the cerebrum. We conclude that the mammalian cerebrum scales in an isomorphic, rather than isometric, manner.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in an ongoing global pandemic with significant morbidity, mortality, and economic consequences. The susceptibility of different animal species to SARS-CoV-2 is of concern due to the potential for interspecies transmission, and the requirement for pre-clinical animal models to develop effective countermeasures. In the current study, we determined the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to (i) replicate in porcine cell lines, (ii) establish infection in domestic pigs via experimental oral/intranasal/intratracheal inoculation, and (iii) transmit to co-housed naive sentinel pigs. SARS-CoV-2 was able to replicate in two different porcine cell lines with cytopathic effects. Interestingly, none of the SARS-CoV-2-inoculated pigs showed evidence of clinical signs, viral replication or SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses. Moreover, none of the sentinel pigs displayed markers of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data indicate that although different porcine cell lines are permissive to SARS-CoV-2, five-week old pigs are not susceptible to infection via oral/intranasal/intratracheal challenge. Pigs are therefore unlikely to be significant carriers of SARS-CoV-2 and are not a suitable pre-clinical animal model to study SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis or efficacy of respective vaccines or therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Understanding antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 is indispensable for the development of containment measures to overcome the current COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we determine the ability of sera from 101 recovered healthcare workers to neutralize both authentic SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus and address their antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and spike receptor-binding domain. Interestingly, the majority of individuals have low neutralization capacity and only 6% of the healthcare workers showed high neutralizing titers against both authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus and the pseudotyped virus. We found the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection generates antigen-specific isotypes as well as a diverse combination of antibody isotypes, with high titers of IgG, IgM and IgA against both antigens correlating with neutralization capacity. Importantly, we found that neutralization correlated with antibody titers as quantified by ELISA. This suggests that an ELISA assay can be used to determine seroneutralization potential. Altogether, our work provides a snapshot of the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody response in recovered healthcare workers and provides evidence that possessing multiple antibody isotypes may play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 neutralization.",

    "abstract": "The double-membrane-bound architecture of mitochondria, essential for ATP production, sub-divides the organelle into inter-membrane space (IMS) and matrix. IMS and matrix possess contrasting oxido-reductive environments and distinct protein quality control (PQC) machineries resulting different protein folding environments. To understand the nature of stress response elicited by equivalent proteotoxic stress to sub-mitochondrial compartments, we fused well-described bipartite or matrix-targeting signal sequences to misfolding and aggregation-prone stressor proteins to target and impart stress to yeast mitochondrial IMS or matrix. We show, mitochondrial proteotoxicity leads to growth arrest of yeast cells of varying degrees depending on nature of stressor proteins and the intra-mitochondrial location of stress. Next, using transcriptomics and proteomics, we report a comprehensive stress response elicited by two types of targeting signal-fused stressor proteins. Among global responses by mitochondria-targeted stressors by both types of signal sequences, an adaptive response of abrogated mitochondrial respiration and concomitant upregulation of glycolysis is uncovered. Beyond shared stress responses, specific signatures due to stress within mitochondrial sub-compartments are also revealed. We report that bipartite signal sequence-fused stressor proteins eliciting stress to IMS, leads to specific upregulation of IMS-chaperones and TOM complex components. In contrast, matrix-targeted stressors lead to specific upregulation of matrix-chaperones and cytosolic PQC components. Finally, by systematic genetic interaction using deletion strains of differentially upregulated genes, we found prominent modulatory role of TOM complex components during IMS-stress response. In contrast, VMS1 markedly modulates the stress response originated from matrix.",

    "abstract": "In development, lineage segregation of multiple lineages must be coordinated in time and space. An important example is the mammalian inner cell mass (ICM), in which the primitive endoderm (PrE, founder of the yolk sac) physically segregates from the epiblast (EPI, founder of the foetus). The physical mechanisms that determine this spatial segregation between EPI and PrE are still poorly understood. Here, we identify an asymmetry in cell-cell affinity, a mechanical property thought to play a significant role in tissue sorting in other systems, between EPI and PrE precursors (pEPI and pPrE). However, a computational model of cell sorting indicated that these differences alone appeared insufficient to explain the spatial segregation. We also observed significantly greater surface fluctuations in pPrE compared to pEPI. Including the enhanced surface fluctuation in pPrE in our simulation led to robust cell sorting. We identify phospho-ERM regulated membrane tension as an important mediator of the increased surface fluctuations in pPrE. Using aggregates of engineered cell lines with different surface fluctuation levels cells with higher surface fluctuations were consistently excluded to the outside of the aggregate. These cells behaved similarly when incorporated in the embryo. Surface fluctuations-driven segregation is reminiscent of activity-induced phase separation, a sorting phenomenon in colloidal physics. Together, our experiments and model identify dynamic cell surface fluctuations, in addition to static mechanical properties, as a key factor for orchestrating the correct spatial positioning of the founder embryonic lineages.",

    "abstract": "Since 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected ten millions of people across the globe, and massive mutations in virus genome have occurred during the rapid spread of this novel coronavirus. Variance in protein sequence might lead to change in protein structure and interaction, then further affect the viral physiological characteristics, which could bring tremendous influence on the pandemic. In this study, we investigated 18 non-synonymous mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome which incidence rates were all [&ge;]1% as of July 15th, 2020, then modeled the mutated protein structures and compared them with the reference ones. The results showed that four types of mutations could cause dramatic changes in protein structures (RMSD [&ge;]5.0 [A]), which were Q57H and G251V in open reading frames 3a (ORF3a), S194L and R203K/G204R in nucleocapsid (N). Next, we found that these mutations could affect the binding affinity of intraviral protein interactions. In addition, the hot spots within these docking complexes were altered, among which the mutation Q57H was involved in both Orf3a-Orf8 and Orf3a-S protein interactions. Besides, these mutations were widely distributed all over the world, and their occurrences fluctuated as time went on. Notably, the incidences of R203K/G204R in N and Q57H in Orf3a were both over 50% in some countries. Overall, our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 mutations can change viral protein structure, binding affinity and hot spots of the interface, thereby may have impacts on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "For quantitative systems biology, simultaneous readout of multiple cellular processes as well as precise, independent control over different genes activities are essential. In contrast to readout systems such as fluorescent proteins, control systems such as inducible transcription-factor-promoter systems have only been characterized in an ad hoc fashion, impeding precise system-level manipulations of biological systems and reliable modeling.\n\nWe designed and performed systematic benchmarks involving easy-to-communicate units to characterize and compare inducible transcriptional systems. We built a comprehensive single-copy library of inducible systems controlling standardized fluorescent protein expression in budding yeast, including GAL1pr, GALL, MET3pr, CUP1pr, PHO5pr, tetOpr, terminator-tetOpr, Z3EV system, the blue-light optogenetic systems El222-LIP, El222-GLIP and the red-light inducible PhyB-PIF3 system. To analyze these systems dynamic properties, we performed high-throughput time-lapse microscopy. The analysis of >100 000 cell images was made possible by the recently developed convolutional neural network YeaZ. We report key kinetic parameters, scaling of noise levels, impacts on growth, and, crucially, the fundamental leakiness of each system. Our multidimensional benchmarking additionally uncovers unexpected disadvantages of widely used tools, e.g., nonmonotonic activity of the MET3 and GALL promoters, slow off kinetics of the doxycycline and estradiol-inducible systems tetOpr and Z3EV, and high variability of PHO5pr and red-light activated PhyB-PIF3 system. We introduce two new tools for controlling gene expression: strongLOV, a more light-sensitive El222 mutant, and ARG3pr that functions as an OR gate induced by the lack of arginine or presence of methionine. To demonstrate the ability to finely control genetic circuits, we experimentally tuned the time between cell cycle Start and mitotic entry in budding yeast, artificially simulating near-wild-type timing.\n\nThe characterizations presented here define the compromises that need to be made for quantitative experiments in systems and synthetic biology. To calibrate perturbations across laboratories and to allow new inducible systems to be benchmarked, we deposited single-copy reporter yeast strains, plasmids, and computer analysis code in public repositories.

    "abstract": "Age-associated low-grade sterile inflammation, commonly referred to as inflammaging, is a recognized hallmark of aging, which contributes to many age-related diseases. While tissue-resident macrophages are innate immune cells that secrete many types of inflammatory cytokines in response to various stimuli, it is not clear whether they have a role in driving inflammaging. Here we characterized the transcriptional changes associated with physiological aging in mouse resident macrophage populations across different tissues and sexes. Although the age-related transcriptomic signatures of resident macrophages were strikingly tissue-specific, the differentially expressed genes were collectively enriched for those with important innate immune functions such as antigen presentation, cytokine production, and cell adhesion. The brain-resident microglia had the most wide-ranging age-related alterations, with compromised expression of tissue-specific genes and relatively exaggerated responses to endotoxin stimulation. Despite the tissue-specific patterns of aging transcriptomes, components of the hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway were decreased in aged macrophages across multiple tissues. In vivo suppression of Hh signaling in young animals increased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, while in vitro activation of Hh signaling in old macrophages, in turn, suppressed the expression of these inflammatory cytokines. This suggests that hedgehog signaling could be a potential intervention axis for mitigating age-associated inflammation and related diseases. Overall, our data represent a resourceful catalog of tissue-specific and sex-specific transcriptomic changes in resident macrophages of peritoneum, liver, and brain, during physiological aging.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Rimac river is the main source of water for Lima, Perus capital megacity. The river is constantly affected by different types of contamination including mine tailings in the Andes and urban sewage in the metropolitan area. We aim to produce the first characterization of bacterial communities in the Rimac river using a 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing approach which would be useful to identify bacterial diversity and potential understudied pathogens.\n\nResultsWe report a higher diversity in bacterial communities from the Upper and, especially, Middle Rimac compared to the Lower Rimac (Metropolitan zone). Samples were generally grouped according to their geographical location. Bacterial classes Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroidia, Campylobacteria, Fusobacteriia, and Gammaproteobacteria were the most frequent along the river. Arcobacter cryaerophilus (Campylobacteria) was the most frequent species in the Lower Rimac while Flavobacterium succinicans (Bacteroidia) and Hypnocyclicus (Fusobacteriia) were the most predominant in the Upper Rimac. Predicted metabolic functions in the microbiota include bacterial motility, quorum sensing and xenobiotics metabolism. Additional metabolomic analyses showed the presence natural flavonoids and antibiotics in the Upper Rimac, and herbicides in the Lower Rimac.\n\nConclusionsThe dominance in the Metropolitan area of Arcobacter cryaerophilus, an emergent pathogen associated with fecal contamination and antibiotic multiresistance, but that is not usually reported in traditional microbiological quality assessments, highlights the necessity to apply next-generation sequencing tools to improve pathogen surveillance. We believe that our study will encourage the integration of omics sciences in Peru and its application on current environmental and public health issues.",

    "abstract": "Approximately one-third of global CO2 fixation occurs in a phase separated algal organelle called the pyrenoid. Existing data suggest that the pyrenoid forms by the phase-separation of the CO2-fixing enzyme Rubisco with a linker protein; however, the molecular interactions underlying this phase-separation remain unknown. Here we present the structural basis of the interactions between Rubisco and its intrinsically disordered linker protein EPYC1 (Essential Pyrenoid Component 1) in the model alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We find that EPYC1 consists of five evenly-spaced Rubisco-binding regions that share sequence similarity. Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy of one of these regions in complex with Rubisco indicates that each Rubisco holoenzyme has eight binding sites for EPYC1, one on each Rubisco small subunit. Interface mutations disrupt binding, phase separation, and pyrenoid formation. Cryo-electron tomography supports a model where EPYC1 and Rubisco form a co-dependent multivalent network of specific low-affinity bonds, giving the matrix liquid-like properties. Our results advance the structural and functional understanding of the phase separation underlying the pyrenoid, an organelle that plays a fundamental role in the global carbon cycle.",

To determine this biological function of epigenetics, we cultured piPSCs in different culture conditions. We found that activation of pluripotent gene- and pluripotency-related pathways requires the erasure of H3K9 methylation modification which was further influenced by mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) served feeder. By dissecting the dynamic change of H3K9 methylation during loss of pluripotency, we demonstrated that the H3K9 demethylases KDM3A and KDM3B regulated global H3K9me2/me3 level and that their co-depletion led to the collapse of the pluripotency gene regulatory network. Immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) provided evidence that KDM3A and KDM3B formed a complex to perform H3K9 demethylation. The genome-wide regulation analysis revealed that OCT4 (O) and SOX2 (S), the core pluripotency transcriptional activators, maintained the pluripotent state of piPSCs depending on the H3K9 hypomethylation. Further investigation revealed that O/S cooperating with histone demethylase complex containing KDM3A and KDM3B promoted pluripotency genes expression to maintain the pluripotent state of piPSCs. Together, these data offer a unique insight into the epigenetic pluripotency network of piPSCs.\n\nSummaryErasure of H3K9 methylation in porcine pluripotent stem cells depends on the complex of transcription factors OCT4/SOX2 and histone demethylase KDM3A/KDM3B.",

    "abstract": "Avoiding loss of functional beta cell mass is critical for preventing or treating diabetes. Currently, the molecular mechanisms underlying beta cell death are partially understood, and there is a need to identify new targets for developing novel therapeutics to treat diabetes. Previously, our group established that Mig6, an inhibitor of EGF signaling, mediates beta cell death under diabetogenic conditions. The objective of this study was to clarify the mechanisms linking diabetogenic stimuli to beta cell death by investigating Mig6-interacting proteins. Using co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we evaluated the binding partners of Mig6 under both normal glucose (NG) and glucolipotoxic (GLT) conditions in beta cells. We identified that Mig6 interacts dynamically with NumbL; whereas Mig6 associates with NumbL under NG, this interaction is disrupted under GLT conditions. Further, we demonstrate that siRNA-mediated suppression of NumbL expression in beta cells prevented apoptosis under GLT conditions by blocking activation of NF-{kappa}B signaling. Using co-immunoprecipitation experiments we observed that NumbLs interactions with TRAF6, a key component of NF{kappa}B signaling, are increased under GLT conditions. The interactions among Mig6, NumbL, and TRAF6 are dynamic and context-dependent. We propose a model wherein these interactions activate pro-apoptotic NF-{kappa}B signaling while blocking pro-survival EGF signaling under diabetogenic conditions, leading to beta cell apoptosis. These findings indicate that NumbL should be further investigated as a candidate anti-diabetic therapeutic target.",

The C3 stereocentre acts as toggle-switch for helix to non-helical structures in double-stranded nucleic acids. Thus, the ribose containing double-stranded nucleic acids result in well-organized helical structures, while those containing xylose and lyxose show a variety of structures, which include (circular) ladder configurations. Based on the present set of results, it can be inferred that ribose containing double-stranded nucleic acids form well-defined helical structures in contrast to their C2 and C3 epimers.",

    "abstract": "In cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of radiation-sensitive biological samples, both the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the contrast of images are critically important in the image processing pipeline. Classic methods improve low-frequency image contrast experimentally, by imaging with high defocus, or computationally, by applying various types of low-pass filter. These contrast improvements typically come at the expense of high-frequency SNR, which is suppressed by high-defocus imaging and removed by low pass filtration. Here, we demonstrate that a convolutional neural network (CNN) denoising algorithm can be used to significantly enhance SNR and generate contrast in cryo-EM images. We provide a quantitative evaluation of bias introduced by the denoising procedure and its influences on image processing and three-dimensional reconstructions. Our study suggests that besides enhancing the visual contrast of cryo-EM images, the enhanced SNR of denoised images may facilitate better outcomes in the other parts of the image processing pipeline, such as classification and 3D alignment. Overall, our results provide a ground of using denoising CNNs in the cryo-EM image processing pipeline.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have investigated the association between microbial and colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the replicable markers for early stage adenoma diagnosis across multiple populations remain elusive. Here, a meta-analysis of six studies, comprising a total of 1057 fecal samples, was performed to identify candidate markers. By adjusting the potential confounders, 11 and 26 markers (P<0.05) were identified and separately applied into constructing Random Forest classifier models to discriminate adenoma from control, and adenoma from CRC, achieving robust diagnostic accuracy with AUC = 0.80 and 0.89, respectively. Moreover, these markers demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy in independent validation cohorts. Pooled functional analysis and targeted qRT-PCR based genetic profiles reveal that the altered microbiome triggers different pathways of ADP-heptose and menaquinone biosynthesis (P<0.05) in adenoma vs. control and adenoma vs. CRC sequences respectively. The combined analysis of heterogeneous studies confirm adenoma-specific but universal markers across multi-populations, which improves early diagnosis and prompt treatment of CRC.",

    "abstract": "Genome editing in plants typically relies on T-DNA plasmids that are mobilized by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation to deliver the CRISPR/Cas9 machinery. Here, we introduce a series of CRISPR/Cas9 T-DNA vectors for minimal lab settings, such as in the classroom or citizen science projects. Spacer sequences targeting genes of interest can be inserted as annealed short oligonucleotides in a single straightforward cloning step. Fluorescent markers expressed in mature seeds enable reliable selection of transgenic as well as transgene-free individuals using a combination of inexpensive LED lamps and colored-glass alternative filters. Testing these tools on the Arabidopsis GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR (GRF) gene family, we found that Cas9 expression from an EGG CELL1 (EC1) promoter resulted in tenfold lower mutation rates than expression from a UBIQUITIN10 (UBQ10) promoter. A collection of bona fide null mutations in all nine GRF genes could be established with little effort. Finally, we explored the effects of simultaneously targeting two, four and eight GRF genes on the rate of induced mutations at each target locus. Multiplexing caused strong interference effects: while mutation rates at some loci remained consistently high, mutation rates at other loci dropped dramatically with increasing number of single guide RNA species. Our results suggest potential detrimental genetic interaction between induced mutations as well as competition of CRISPR RNAs for a limiting amount of Cas9 apoprotein.",

Although the highly dynamic nature of Env intramolecular conformations has been shown with single molecule spectroscopy in vitro, the bona fide Env intra- and intermolecular mechanics when engaged in live T cells remains unknown. We used both, two photon fast fluorescence lifetime imaging detection of single-molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer and single molecule photobleaching to reveal transitions between intramolecular and intermolecular conformations that mediate Env clustering. Furthermore, we show that three broad neutralizing anti-Env antibodies directed to different epitopes destabilise Env intramolecular dynamics and their clusters when engaged to living T cells. Importantly, our results show that Env clustering is a common conformation across different HIV-1 Env strains, which depends on efficient virus maturation, and that is disrupted upon binding of Env to CD4 or to neutralizing antibodies.

    "abstract": "Actin capping proteins (CPs) are essential regulators of actin dynamics in all eukaryotes. Their structure and function have been extensively characterized in higher eukaryotes but their role and mechanism of action in apicomplexan parasites remain enigmatic. Here, we present a crystal structure of a unique homodimeric CP from the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei. In addition, we compare homo- and heterodimeric arrangements of P. berghei CPs (PbCPs) in solution. We complement our findings by describing the regulatory effects of PbCPs on heterologous skeletal muscle -actin as well as parasite actin. Comprehensive kinetic and steadystate measurements show atypical regulation of actin dynamics; PbCPs facilitate rapid turnover of parasite actin I without affecting the apparent critical concentration. Possibly to rescue actin filament capping in life cycle stages where the CP {beta}-subunit is downregulated, homo- and heterodimeric PbCPs show redundant effects in vitro. However, our data suggest that homodimers may in addition influence actin kinetics by recruiting lateral actin dimers. This unusual function could arise from the absence of a {beta}-subunit, as the asymmetric PbCP homodimer lacks the structural elements essential for canonical barbed end interactions, suggesting a novel CP binding mode. These findings facilitate further studies aimed at elucidating the precise actin filament capping mechanism in Plasmodium and the eligibility of PbCPs as drug targets against malaria.\n\nSignificance statementMalaria parasites of the genus Plasmodium display a unique form of gliding motility, which depends on an unconventional actomyosin motor. Actin capping proteins (CPs) play a major role in regulating parasite motility. Here, we describe a unique Plasmodium berghei CP (PbCP) system, behaving contradictory to canonical heterodimeric CPs, more suited to regulate the fast dynamics of the parasite actin system. We present the crystal structure of a distinctive homodimeric form of PbCP and extensive biochemical data, describing the atypical behavior of each PbCP form. The PbCP homodimer displays capping even in the absence of canonical conserved structural elements, suggesting a novel actin-CP interaction mode. These distinct structural properties could provide opportunities for drug design against malaria.",

    "abstract": "In 2019, drug overdose has claimed over 70,000 lives in the United States. More than half of the deaths are related to synthetic opioids represented by fentanyl which is a potent agonist of mu-opioid receptor (mOR). In recent years, the crystal structures of mOR in complex with morphine derivatives have been determined; however, structural basis of mOR activation by fentanyl-like synthetic opioids remains lacking. Exploiting the X-ray structure of mOR bound to a morphinan ligand and several state-of-the-art simulation techniques, including weighted ensemble and continuous constant pH molecular dynamics, we elucidated the detailed binding mechanism of fentanyl with mOR. Surprisingly, in addition to forming a salt-bridge with Asp1473.32 in the orthosteric site common to morphinan opiates, fentanyl can move deeper and bind mOR through hydrogen bonding with a conserved histidine His2976.52, which has been shown to modulate mORs ligand affinity and pH dependence in mutagenesis experiments, but its precise role remains unclear. Intriguingly, the secondary binding mode is only accessible when His297 adopts a neutral HID tautomer. Alternative binding modes and involvement of tautomer states may represent general mechanisms in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-ligand recognition. Our work provides a starting point for understanding the molecular basis of mOR activation by fentanyl which has many analogs emerging at a rapid pace. The knowledge may also inform the design of safer analgesics to combat the opioid crisis. Current protein simulation studies employ standard protonation and tautomer states; our work demonstrates the need to move beyond the practice to advance our understanding of protein-ligand recognition.",
