    "abstract": "Subcutaneous obesity is associated with better metabolic health than visceral obesity. Here, we leverage two mouse models with differing quantities of visceral and subcutaneous fat to assess the role of fat distribution in glucose homeostasis. Interestingly, we found genetic ablation of inguinal subcutaneous fat does not exacerbate obesity-associated impairments in glucose metabolism. Consistent with this observation, mutant mice that preferentially accrue subcutaneous fat display a similar metabolic profile to controls with equal fat mass. Importantly, the increased subcutaneous adiposity in these mice occurs downstream of androgen receptor deficiency and is not driven by elevated adiponectin activity. Rather, it is caused by diminished adipocyte precursor seeding in nascent visceral fat and proportionally greater growth of subcutaneous fat. Thus, the pattern of obesogenic fat mass expansion can be determined early in development without impacting glucose metabolism. This suggests that different mechanisms underlying biased fat accumulation exert different effects on glucometabolic health.",

    "abstract": "Incomplete lung development, also known as pulmonary hypoplasia, is a recognized cause of neonatal death and poor outcome for survivors. To date, there is no effective treatment that promotes fetal lung growth and maturation. Herein, we describe a novel stem cell-based approach that enhances fetal lung development via the administration of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from amniotic fluid stem cells (AFSCs). In experimental models of pulmonary hypoplasia, administration of AFSC-EVs promoted lung branching morphogenesis and alveolarization, and stimulated pulmonary epithelial cell and fibroblast differentiation. This regenerative ability was confirmed in two models of injured human lung cells, where human AFSC-EVs obtained following good manufacturing practices restored pulmonary epithelial homeostasis. AFSC-EV beneficial effects were exerted via the release of RNA cargo, primarily miRNAs, that regulate the expression of genes involved in fetal lung development. Our findings suggest that AFSC-EVs hold regenerative ability for underdeveloped fetal lungs, demonstrating potential for therapeutic application.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryFetal lung regeneration via administration of extracellular vesicles derived from amniotic fluid stem cells",

    "abstract": "Transmission of epigenetic information between generations occurs in nematodes, flies and plants, mediated by specialised small RNA pathways, histone H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H4K16ac and DNA methylation1-3. In higher vertebrates, epidemiological and experimental evidence supports similar trans-generational effects4,5 although the mechanisms that underpin these are incompletely understood6-9. We generated a luciferase reporter knock-in mouse for the imprinted Dlk1 locus, to visualise and track epigenetic fidelity across generations. We showed that exposure to high-fat diet (HFD) in pregnancy provokes sustained re-expression of the normally silent maternal Dlk1 allele in offspring, coincident with increased DNA methylation at the Dlk1 sDMR. Interestingly, maternal Dlk1 mis-expression was also evident in the next generation (F2), exclusively in animals derived from F1-exposed females. Oocytes from these females showed altered microRNA and gene expression, without any major changes in underlying DNA methylation, and correctly imprinted Dlk1 expression resumed in subsequent generations (F3 onwards). Our results reveal how canonical and non-canonical imprinting mechanisms enable the foetal epigenome to adapt to in utero challenge to modulate the properties of two successive generations of offspring.",

    "abstract": "The impressive array of morphological diversity among animal taxa represents the product of millions of years of evolution. Morphology is the output of development, therefore phenotypic evolution arises from changes to the topology of the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that control the highly coordinated process of embryogenesis1. While genetic variation can arise anywhere in the genome and affect any part of an individual GRN, the need to form a viable embryo provides a constraint on the types of variation that pass the filter of selection. A particular challenge in understanding the origins of animal diversity lies in determining how GRNs incorporate novelty while preserving the overall stability of the network, and hence, embryonic viability. Here we assemble a comprehensive GRN, consisting of 42 genes (nodes) and 84 interactions (edges), for the model of endomesoderm specification in the sea star from zygote through gastrulation that corresponds to the GRN for sea urchin development of equivalent territories and stages2. Using these detailed models we make the first systems-level comparison of early development and examine how novelty is incorporated into GRNs. We show how the GRN is resilient to the introduction of a transcription factor, pmar1, the inclusion of which leads to a switch between two stable modes of Delta-Notch signaling. Signaling pathways can function in multiple modes and we propose that GRN changes that lead to switches between modes may be a common evolutionary mechanism for changes in embryogenesis. Our data additionally proposes a model in which evolutionarily conserved network motifs, or kernels, may function throughout development to stabilize these signaling transitions.",

    "abstract": "Larval settlement and metamorphosis are regulated by nitric oxide (NO) signalling in a wide diversity of marine invertebrates (1-10). It is surprising, then, that in most invertebrates, the substrate for NO synthesis - arginine - cannot be biosynthesized but instead must be exogenously sourced (11). In the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica, vertically-inherited proteobacterial symbionts in the larva are able to biosynthesize arginine (12,13). Here we test the hypothesis that symbionts might provide arginine to the sponge host so that nitric oxide synthase expressed in the larva can produce NO, which induces metamorphosis (8), and the byproduct citrulline (Fig. 1). First, we find support for an arginine-citrulline biosynthetic loop in this sponge larval holobiont using stable isotope tracing. In symbionts, incorporated 13C-citrulline decreases as 13C-arginine increases, consistent with the use of exogenous citrulline for arginine synthesis. In contrast, 13C-citrulline accumulates in larvae as 13C-arginine decreases, demonstrating the uptake of exogenous arginine and its conversion to NO and citrulline. Second, we show that while Amphimedon larvae can derive arginine directly from seawater, normal settlement and metamorphosis can occur in artificial sea water lacking arginine. Together, these results support holobiont complementation of the arginine-citrulline loop and NO biosynthesis in Amphimedon larvae, suggesting a critical role for bacterial symbionts in the development of this marine sponge. Given that NO regulates settlement and metamorphosis in diverse animal phyla (1-10) and arginine is procured externally in most animals (11), we propose that symbionts may play a equally critical regulatory role in this essential life cycle transition in other metazoans.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=95 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/240770v1_fig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (44K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1625afcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@438543org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e1fd20org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b155de_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 1.C_FLOATNO Amphimedon queenslandica cannot synthesize arginine, which is required for nitric oxide-induced settlement and metamorphosis.

    "abstract": "There is a widespread belief in ecology that the capacity of animals to orchestrate systematic and planned paths should represent a significant benefit for efficient search and exploration. Within this view, stochasticity observed in real animal trajectories is mostly understood as undesirable noise caused by internal or external effects. Far less is known, however, about the case when cognitive errors and limitations inherent to living systems are explicitly put into play. Here we compare within this context the search efficiency of (i) walkers driven by Bayesian rules generating deterministic paths, (ii) standard random walkers, and (iii) human trajectories obtained from search experiments in a soccer field and on the computer screen. Our results clearly challenge the view that deterministic paths are generally better for exploration than random strategies, as the latter are more resilient to cognitive errors. Instead, we provide numerical and experimental evidence that stochasticity would provide living organisms with a sufficient and cognitively simple exploration solution to the problem of uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "Fires determine vegetation patterns, impact human societies, and provide complex feedbacks into the global climate system. Empirical and process-based models differ in their scale and mechanistic assumptions, giving divergent predictions of fire drivers and extent. Especially, the role of anthropogenic drivers remains less understood. Taking a data-driven approach, we use an artificial neural network to learn region-specific relationships between fire and its socio-environmental drivers across the globe. As a result, our models achieve higher predictability than previously reported, with global spatial correlation of 0.92, temporal correlation of 0.76, interannual correlation of 0.69, and grid-cell level correlation of 0.6, between predicted and observed burned area. Our analysis reveals universal global patterns in fire-climate interactions, coupled with strong regional differences in fire-human relationships. Given the current socio-anthropogenic conditions, Equatorial Asia, southern Africa, and Australia show a strong sensitivity of fire extent to temperature whereas northern Africa shows a strong negative sensitivity. Overall, forests and shrublands, show a stronger sensitivity of burned area to temperature compared to savannas, potentially weakening their status as carbon sinks under future climate-change scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Although the study of bird acoustic communities has great potential to provide valuable conservation data, many aspects of their assembly and dynamics remain poorly understood. Grassland habitats in South Asia comprise distinct biomes with a unique avifauna, presenting an opportunity to address how community-level patterns in acoustic signal space arise. Similarity in signal space of different grassland bird communities may be due to phylogenetic similarity, or because different bird groups partition the acoustic resource, resulting in convergent distributions in signal space. Here, we quantify the composition, signal space and phylogenetic diversity of bird acoustic communities from the dry semiarid grasslands of Northwest India and the wet floodplain grasslands of Northeast India. We find that acoustic communities occupying these distinct biomes exhibit convergent signal space. However, dry grasslands exhibit higher phylogenetic diversity, and the two communities are not phylogenetically more similar than expected by chance. The Sylvioidea encompasses half the species in the wet grassland acoustic community, with an expanded signal space compared to the dry grasslands. Thus, dry and wet grassland communities are convergent in signal space despite differences in phylogenetic diversity. We therefore hypothesize that different clades colonizing grasslands partition the acoustic resource, resulting in convergent community structure across biomes. Many of the birds we recorded are highly threatened, and acoustic monitoring will support conservation measures in these imperiled, yet poorly-studied habitats.",

    "abstract": "The European Union categorised pond sliders (Trachemys scripta) as an invasive species for which all member countries have to develop an action plan. While T. scripta has been released illegally in thousands of freshwaters in Europe, monitoring programs in Germany are missing. Based on short term surveys, anecdotal data, and assumptions, the action plan in Germany proposes that T. scripta does not represent a problem as the cold weather causes high mortality and does not allow for successful reproduction. Here I present data of five years of monitoring at the Altrhein of Kehl, at the border between Germany and France showing: 1. Apart from T. scripta, five additional species have been released (Pseudemys nelson, Pseudemys concinna, Graptemys pseudogeographica, Mauremys spec., Chrysemys picta.). 2. Population size seemed to increase over the years, with 116 individuals being counted in 2020 compared to 33 individuals in 2016. 3. Successful reproduction of. T. scripta was indicated by the observation of very small individuals and proved by the collection of hatchlings in two years. While the data presented here would benefit from more years of more intensive monitoring, they are sufficient to draw the conclusion that the German action plan is insufficient because individuals survive for long periods and do reproduce successfully. Similar results have been reported from other central European countries. Thus, T. scripta might become invasive not only in south but also in central Europe. In sum, national action plans of how to deal with the invasive T. scripta should to be revised in Germany and many other European countries.",

    "abstract": "Theory predicts that the sexes can achieve greater fitness if loci with sexually antagonistic polymorphisms become linked to the sex determining loci, and this can favour the spread of reduced recombination around sex determining regions. Given that sex-linked regions are frequently repetitive and highly heterozygous, few complete Y chromosome assemblies are available to test these ideas. The guppy system (Poecilia reticulata) has long been invoked as an example of sex chromosome formation resulting from sexual conflict. Early genetics studies revealed that male colour patterning genes are mostly but not entirely Y-linked, and that X-linkage may be most common in low predation populations. More recent population genomic studies of guppies have reached varying conclusions about the size and placement of the Y-linked region. However, this previous work used a reference genome assembled from short-read sequences from a female guppy. Here, we present a new guppy reference genome assembly from a male, using long-read PacBio single-molecule real-time sequencing (SMRT) and chromosome contact information. Our new assembly sequences across repeat- and GC-rich regions and thus closes gaps and corrects mis-assemblies found in the short-read female-derived guppy genome. Using this improved reference genome, we then employed broad population sampling to detect sex differences across the genome. We identified two small regions that showed consistent male-specific signals. Moreover, our results help reconcile the contradictory conclusions put forth by past population genomic studies of the guppy sex chromosome. Our results are consistent with a small Y-specific region and rare recombination in male guppies.",

    "abstract": "Gamete size variation between the sexes is central to the concept of sex roles, however, to what extent gamete size variation within the sexes relates to sex role variation remains unclear. Comparative and theoretical studies suggest that, when clutch size is invariable, polyandry is linked to a reduction of egg size, while increased female-female competition for mates favors early breeding when females cannot monopolize multiple males. To understand whether and how breeding phenology, egg size, and mating behavior are related at the individual level, we studied the reproductive histories of 424 snowy plover females observed in the wild over a 15-year period. Egg size, but not polyandry, were highly repeatable for individual females. Consistent with theoretical predictions, we found that polyandrous females were the earliest breeders and that early clutches contained smaller eggs than clutches initiated later. Neither egg size nor mating behavior showed clear signs of an age-related deterioration, on the contrary, prior experience acquired either through age or local recruitment enabled females to nest early. Taken together, these results suggest that gamete size variation is not linked to mating behavior at the individual level, and, consequently, the adaptive potential of such variation appears to be limited.\n\nTeaser TextComparative avian analyses have linked female polyandry and sex-role reversal to the production of smaller eggs: the notion being that smaller eggs allow polyandrous females to lay multiple sequential clutches quickly. Our research, however, has found that the notion is more complex at the individual level. We found that females who started breeding early in the season were more likely to be polyandrous and produce smaller eggs. Experience was also found to give older and locally-raised females a competitive advantage over younger and inexperienced females vying for early breeding opportunities. Despite this, we found limited evidence that egg size reduction gives a competitive advantage in the scramble for mates. Instead, seasonal variations in egg size can likely be attributed to other factors, such as the survival of early-hatching chicks, resource limitations during egg production, and individual differences. We found that senescence had little impact on egg size or mating behavior. Future research should also examine how seasonality, age, and mating behavior impact the reproductive fitness of males, who provide more parental care than females in many sex role reversed systems. By studying these effects in concert, we can gain a deeper understanding of sex roles in natural populations.",

We simultaneously monitored susceptibility to clothianidin and to SumiShield(R) 50WG, testing adults of Anopheles gambiae, An. coluzzii and Culex sp collected from urban, suburban and agricultural areas of Yaounde. We found that the level of susceptibility to the active ingredient predicted the efficacy of SumiShield(R) 50WG. This formulation was very potent against populations that achieved 100% mortality within 72 h of exposure to a discriminating dose of clothianidin. By contrast, mortality leveled off at 75.4 {+/-} 3.5 % within 7 days of exposure to SumiShield(R) 50WG in An. gambiae adults collected from a farm where spraying of acetamiprid and imidacloprid is driving cross-resistance to clothianidin.

    "abstract": "Background and aimsAtherosclerosis is a lipid-driven inflammatory disease presumably initiated by endothelial activation. Low vascular shear stress is known for its ability to activate endothelial cells. Differential DNA methylation (DNAm) is a relatively unexplored player in atherosclerotic disease development and endothelial dysfunction. Literature search revealed that expression of 11 genes have been found to be associated with differential DNAm due to low shear stress in endothelial cells. We hypothesized a causal relationship between DNAm of shear stress associated genes in human carotid plaque and increased risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nMethodsUsing Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis, we explored the potential causal role of DNAm of shear stress associated genes on cardiovascular disease risk. We used genetic and DNAm data of 442 carotid endarterectomy derived advanced plaques from the Athero-Express Biobank Study for quantitative trait loci (QTL) discovery and performed MR analysis using these QTLs and GWAS summary statistics of coronary artery disease (CAD) and ischemic stroke (IS).\n\nResultsWe discovered 9 methylation QTLs in plaque for differentially methylated shear stress associated genes. We found no significant effect of shear stress gene promotor methylation and increased risk of CAD and IS.\n\nConclusionsDifferential methylation of shear stress associated genes in advanced atherosclerotic plaques in unlikely to increase cardiovascular risk.\n\nHighlights- Plaque-derived DNA methylation in shear stress associated genes shows no significant effect on cardiovascular disease\n- Genetic variants in shear stress associated genes affect DNA methylation in human carotid plaque\n- Human validation of atherosclerotic associated genes in murine models",

    "abstract": "Identifying the genetic variations impacting human brain structure and their further effects on cognitive functions, is important for our understanding of the fundamental bases of cognition. In this study, we take two different approaches to this issue: classical genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) and a relatedness-based regression approach (REL) to search for associations between genotype and brain structural measures of gray matter and white matter. Instead of searching genetic variants by testing the association between a phenotype trait and the genotype of each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) as in GWAS, REL takes advantage of multiple SNPs within a genomic window as a single measure, which potentially find associations wherever the functional SNP is in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with SNPs that have been sampled. We also conducted a simulation analysis to systemically compare GWAS and REL with respect to different levels of LD. Both methods succeed in identifying genetic variations associated with regional and global brain structural measures and tend to give complementary results due to the different aspects of genetic properties used. Simulation results suggest that GWAS outperforms REL when the signal is relatively weak. However, the collective effects due to local LD boost the performance of REL with increasing signal strength, resulting in better performance than GWAS. Our study suggests that the optimal approach may vary across the genome and that pre-testing for LD could allow GWAS to be preferred where LD is high and REL to be used where LD is low, or the local pattern of LD is complex.",

    "abstract": "Coevolution has been widely studied between species and has an important role in our understanding of biological function. For proteins there has recently been interest in the identification of positions within proteins that have coevolved including their use for modelling protein structure. Such studies focus on the identification of coevolving positions (or evolutionary couplings) within multiple sequence alignments of proteins from many species. Here, we exploit large human genome resources to investigate if it is possible to use genetic variation data from a single species, human, to identify positions within proteins that have coevolved. We combine the 1000 genome project genetic variation data with protein structural data to identify variant-variant interactions within individual human genomes. We find >4,000 combinations of variants that are located close in 3D protein structure and >1,200 in protein-protein interfaces. Many variant combinations include compensatory amino acid changes (e.g. maintaining charge/functional groups), thus supporting that these are coevolutionary events. Our study highlights that it is possible to identify coevolution within a single species. Given the important role that genetic variation plays in causing disease it is important for variant interpretation and precision medicine to consider the gestalt effects of variants rather than individual variants in isolation.",

The Bayesian based phylogeny demonstrated that Himalayan goral, is a highly diverged species from the other reported species of gorals. We claim the presence of two valid sub-species of Himalayan goral, i.e. N. g. bedfordi and N. g. goral, distributed in the western and central Himalaya, respectively. The comparative analysis with the inclusion of data available from different ranges, suggests the presence of plausibly six species of gorals across the distribution with a few valid subspecies. Further, we report that N. griseus is a valid species and not the synonyms of N. goral considering the observed discrepancy in the available sequences. We recommend all the sub-species present at distant locations may be considered as Evolutionary Significant Units (ESUs) and, therefore, appeal to provide them special attention for long term conservation and management.",

    "abstract": "1Nearly 50% of crop yields are lost to pests and disease, with plants and pathogens locked in an amplified co-evolutionary process of disease outbreaks. Coffee wilt disease, caused by Fusarium xylarioides, decimated coffee production in west and central Africa following an initial 1920s outbreak. After successful management, it later re-emerged reaching two separate epidemics by the 2000s on arabica coffee in Ethiopia and robusta coffee in east and central Africa. Here, we use genome sequencing of six historical culture collection strains spanning 70 years to identify the evolutionary processes behind these repeated outbreaks. The robusta population arose from the initial outbreak, whilst the arabica population is divergent and emerged independently. The two populations evolved similar pathologies by separately acquiring different effector genes horizontally via transposable elements from other Fusarium taxa, including F. oxysporum. Thus, historical genomics can help reveal mechanisms that allow fungal pathogens to keep pace with humanitys efforts to resist them.",

Applying an integrative multiomics approach, e.g. combining single-cell RNA-seq, single-cell ATAC-seq together with cell-type-specific DNA methylation and 3D genome measurements, we systematically map the regulatory landscape in the mouse neocortex in vivo. Our analysis identifies thousands of novel enhancer-gene pairs associated with dynamic changes in chromatin accessibility and gene expression along the differentiation trajectory. Crucially, we provide evidence that epigenetic remodeling generally precedes transcriptional activation, yet true priming appears limited to a subset of lineage-determining enhancers. Notably, we reveal considerable heterogeneity in both contact strength and dynamics of the generally cell-type-specific enhancer-promoter contacts. Finally, our work suggests a so far unrecognized function of several key transcription factors which act as putative \"molecular bridges\" and facilitate the dynamic reorganization of the chromatin landscape accompanying lineage specification in the brain.",

    "abstract": "The main goal of this collaborative effort is to provide genome wide data for the previously underrepresented population in Eastern Europe, and to provide cross-validation of the data from genome sequences and genotypes of the same individuals acquired by different technologies. We collected 97 genome-grade DNA samples from consented individuals representing major regions of Ukraine that were consented for the public data release. DNBSEQ-G50 sequences, and genotypes by an Illumina GWAS chip were cross-validated on multiple samples, and additionally referenced to one sample that has been resequenced by Illumina NovaSeq6000 S4 at high coverage. The genome data has been searched for genomic variation represented in this population, and a number of variants have been reported: large structural variants, indels, CNVs, SNPs and microsatellites. This study provides the largest to-date survey of genetic variation in Ukraine, creating a public reference resource aiming to provide data for historic and medical research in a large understudied population. While most of the common variation is shared with other European populations, this survey of population variation contributes a number of novel SNPs and structural variants that have not been reported in the gnomAD/1KG databases representing global distribution of genomic variation. These endemic variants will become a valuable resource for designing future population and clinical studies, help address questions about ancestry and admixture, and will fill a missing place in the puzzle characterizing human population diversity in Eastern Europe. Our results indicate that genetic diversity of the Ukrainian population is uniquely shaped by the evolutionary and demographic forces, and cannot be ignored in the future genetic and biomedical studies. This data will contribute a wealth of new information bringing forth different risk and/or protective alleles. The newly discovered low frequency and local variants can be added to the current genotyping arrays for genome wide association studies, clinical trials, and in genome assessment of proliferating cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "The receptor-like protein (RLP) family is a complex gene family with 57 members in Arabidopsis thaliana. Some members of the RLP family are known to be involved in basal developmental processes, whereas others have found to be involved in defence responses. However, functional data is to date, only available for a small subset of RLPs, leaving the remaining ones classified as RLPs of unknown function. Using publicly available datasets, we annotated those RLPs of unknown functions as either likely defence-related or likely fulfilling a more basal function in plants. Using these categories, we can identify important characteristics that differ between the RLP sub classes. We find the two classes differ in abundance on both transcriptome and proteome level, physical clustering in the genome and putative interaction partners. However, the classes do not differ in the genetic diversity of their individual members in accessible pan-genome data. Our work has several implications for work related to functional studies on RLPs as well as for the understanding of RLP gene family evolution. Using our annotations, we can make suggestions of which RLPs can be identified as potential immune receptors using genetics tools, which can be useful for disease studies. The lack of differences in nucleotide diversity between the two RLP subclasses further suggests that non-synonymous diversity of gene sequences alone cannot distinguish defence from developmental genes. By contrast, differences in transcript and protein abundance or clustering at genomic loci might also allow for functional annotations and characterisation in other plant species.",

In practice, both strategies are subject to uncertainty and must be balanced with respect to their relative confidences; robust learning requires aligning the predictions of both models over historic observations.

    "abstract": "Caspase enzymes play important roles in apoptosis and inflammation, and the non-identical but overlapping specificity profiles direct cells to different fates. Although all caspases prefer aspartate at the P1 position of the substrate, the caspase-6 subfamily shows preference for valine at the P4 position, while caspase-3 shows preference for aspartate. In comparison to human caspases, caspase-3a from zebrafish has relaxed specificity and demonstrates equal selection for either valine or aspartate at the P4 position. In the context of the caspase-3 conformational landscape, we show that changes in hydrogen bonding near the S3 subsite affect selection of the P4 amino acid. Swapping specificity with caspase-6 requires accessing new conformational space, where each landscape results in optimal binding of DxxD (caspase-3) or VxxD (caspase-6) substrate and simultaneously disfavors binding of the other substrate. Within the context of the caspase-3 conformational landscape, substitutions near the active site result in nearly equal activity against DxxD and VxxD by disrupting a hydrogen bonding network in the substrate binding pocket. The converse substitutions in zebrafish caspase-3a result in increased selection for P4 aspartate over valine. Overall, the data show that evolutionary neofunctionalization resulting in a dual function protease, as in zebrafish caspase-3a, requires fewer amino acid substitutions compared to those required to access new conformational space for swapping substrate specificity, such as between caspases-3 and -6.",

    "abstract": "Optoacoustic tomography (OT) enables non-invasive deep tissue imaging of optical contrast at high spatio-temporal resolution. The applications of OT in cancer imaging often rely on the use of molecular imaging contrast agents based on near infrared dyes to enhance contrast at the tumor site. While these agents afford excellent biocompatibility and minimal toxicity, they present limited optoacoustic signal generation capability and rapid renal clearance, which can impede their tumor imaging efficacy. In this work, a synthetic strategy to overcome these limitations utilizing biodegradable DNA-based nanocarrier (DNA-NC) platforms is introduced. DNA-NCs enable the incorporation of near infrared dyes (in this case, IRDye 800CW) at precise positions to enable fluorescence quenching and maximize optoacoustic signal generation. Furthermore, these DNA-NCs show a prolonged blood circulation compared to the native fluorophores, facilitating tumor accumulation by the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect. In vivo imaging of tumor xenografts in mice following intravenous administration of DNA-NCs revealed enhanced OT signals at 24h when compared to free fluorophores, indicating promise for this method to enhance the optoacoustic signal generation capability and tumor uptake of clinically relevant near infrared dyes.",

    "abstract": "Linking phenotypes to specific gene expression profiles is an extremely important problem in biology, which has been approached mainly by correlation methods or, more fundamentally, by studying the effects of gene perturbations. However, genome-wide perturbations involve extensive experimental efforts, which may be prohibitive for certain organisms. On the other hand, the characterization of the various phenotypes frequently requires an experts subjective interpretation, such as a histopathologists description of tissue slide images in terms of complex visual features (e.g.  acinar structures). In this paper, we use Deep Learning to eliminate the inherent subjective nature of these visual histological features and link them to genomic data, thus establishing a more precisely quantifiable correlation between transcriptomes and phenotypes. Using a dataset of whole slide images with matching gene expression data from 39 normal tissue types, we first developed a Deep Learning tissue classifier with an accuracy of 94%. Then we searched for genes whose expression correlates with features inferred by the classifier and demonstrate that Deep Learning can automatically derive visual (phenotypical) features that are well correlated with the transcriptome and therefore biologically interpretable. As we are particularly concerned with interpretability and explainability of the inferred histological models, we also develop visualizations of the inferred features and compare them with gene expression patterns determined by immunohistochemistry. This can be viewed as a first step toward bridging the gap between the level of genes and the cellular organization of tissues.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that are key players in the regulation of gene expression. In the last decade, with the increasing accessibility of high-throughput sequencing technologies, different methods have been developed to identify miRNAs, most of which rely on pre-existing reference genomes. However, when a reference genome is absent or is not of high quality, such identification becomes more difficult. In this context, we developed BrumiR, an algorithm that is able to discover miRNAs directly and exclusively from sRNA-seq data. We benchmarked BrumiR with datasets encompassing animal and plant species using real and simulated sRNA-seq experiments. The results demonstrate that BrumiR reaches the highest recall for miRNA discovery, while at the same time being much faster and more efficient than the state-of-the-art tools evaluated. The latter allows BrumiR to analyze a large number of sRNA-seq experiments, from plants or animals species. Moreover, BrumiR detects additional information regarding other expressed sequences (sRNAs, isomiRs, etc.), thus maximizing the biological insight gained from sRNA-seq experiments. Finally, when a reference genome is available, BrumiR provides a new mapping tool (BrumiR2ref) that performs an a posteriori exhaustive search to identify the precursor sequences. The code of BrumiR is freely available at https://github.com/camoragaq/BrumiR.",

    "abstract": "A problem that arises frequently in high-throughput biological studies is the assessment of technical reproducibility of data obtained under homogeneous experimental conditions. This is an important problem considering the significant growth in the number of high-throughput technologies that have become available to the researcher in the past decade. Although certain ad hoc and graphical methods for determining data quality have been in existence, these methods lack statistical rigor and are not broadly applicable across different technologies. There is an inherent need for the quantitative evaluation of the reproducibility of technical replicates from high-throughput compound and siRNA screening, next-generation sequencing and other modern \"omics\" studies. To this end, we have developed an approach that accounts for technical variability and potential asymmetry that arise naturally in the distribution of replicate data, and aids in the identification of outliers. Our methods for outlier detection rely on flexible statistical models, employ maximum likelihood methods for estimation and are broadly applicable to a variety of high-throughput biological studies. We discuss an adaptation of these methods when there are multiple replicates as well as current limitations to these techniques. We illustrate our methods using experimental data from high-throughput compound screening and protein expression studies as well as simulated data. Our methods are implemented in the R package replicateOutliers and are currently available at github.com/matthew-seth-smith/replicateOutliers.",

    "abstract": "The antigenic diversity of influenza A virus (IAV) circulating in swine challenges the development of effective vaccines, increasing zoonotic threat and pandemic potential. High throughput sequencing technologies are able to quantify IAV genetic diversity, but there are no accurate approaches to adequately describe antigenic phenotypes. This study evaluated an ensemble of non-linear regression models to estimate virus phenotype from genotype. Regression models were trained with a phenotypic dataset of pairwise hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays, using genetic sequence identity and pairwise amino acid mutations as predictor features. The model identified amino acid identity, ranked the relative importance of mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein, and demonstrated good prediction accuracy. Four previously untested IAV strains were selected to experimentally validate model predictions by HI assays. Error between predicted and measured distances of uncharacterized strains were 0.34, 0.70, 2.19, and 0.17 antigenic units. These empirically trained regression models can be used to estimate antigenic distances between different strains of IAV in swine using sequence data. By ranking the importance of mutations in the HA, we provide criteria for identifying antigenically advanced IAV strains that may not be controlled by existing vaccines and can inform strain updates to vaccines to better control this pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning can extract meaningful features from data given enough training examples. Large-scale genomic data are well suited for this class of machine learning algorithms; however, for many of these data the labels are at the level of the sample instead of at the level of the individual genomic measures. Conventional approaches to this data statically featurise and aggregate the measures separately from prediction. We propose to featurise, aggregate, and predict with a single trainable end-to-end model by turning to attention-based multiple instance learning. This allows for direct modelling of instance importance to sample-level classification in addition to trainable encoding strategies of genomic descriptions, such as mutations. We first demonstrate this approach by successfully solving synthetic tasks conventional approaches fail. Subsequently we applied the approach to somatic variants and achieved best-in-class performance when classifying tumour type or microsatellite status, while simultaneously providing an improved level of model explainability. Our results suggest that this framework could lead to biological insights and improve performance on tasks that aggregate information from sets of genomic data.",

Here, we investigated the membrane binding induced aggregation of yeast prion protein Sup35. Using the combination of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) at single molecule resolution and other biophysical studies, we establish that lipid composition and lipid/protein ratio are key modulators of the aggregation kinetics of Sup35. In the presence of zwitterionic membrane, Sup35 exhibited a novel biphasic aggregation kinetics at lipid/protein ratio ranging between 20:1 and 70:1 (termed here as the Optimum Lipid Concentration, OLC). In ratios below (Low Lipid Concentration, LLC) and above (ELC, Excess Lipid Concentration) that range, the aggregation was found to be monophasic. In contrast, in the presence of negatively charged membrane, we did not observe any bi-phasic aggregation kinetics in the entire range of protein to lipid ratios. The toxicity of the aggregates formed within OLC range was found to be greater. Our results provide a mechanistic description of the role that membrane-concentration/composition-modulated-aggregation may play in neurodegenerative diseases.",

The Pab1 RRM2 domain interacts with eIF4G1 BOX3, the canonical interaction site, but also with BOX2, a conserved element of unknown function to date. In contrast, the Pub1 RRM3 domain interacts with the RNA1-1 and BOX1 regions of eIF4G1. Mixtures of Pub1, Pab1 and eIF4G1 form micrometer-size protein condensates that require the presence of the eIF4G1 BOX1 element.

    "abstract": "BackgroundGlioblastoma is the most common and deadly form of primary brain cancer, accounting for more than thirteen thousand new diagnoses annually in the United States alone. Microglia are the innate immune cells within the central nervous system, acting as a front-line defense against injuries and inflammation via a process that involves transformation from a quiescent to an activated phenotype. Crosstalk between GBM cells and microglia represents an important axis to consider in the development of tissue engineering platforms to examine pathophysiological processes underlying GBM progression and therapy.\n\nMethodsThis work used a brain-mimetic hydrogel system to study patient-derived glioblastoma specimens and their interactions with microglia. Here, glioblastoma cells were either cultured alone in 3D hydrogels or in co-culture with microglia in a manner that allowed secretome-based signaling but prevented direct GBM-microglia contact. Patterns of GBM cell invasion were quantified using a three-dimensional spheroid assay. Secretome and transcriptome (via RNAseq) were used to profile the consequences of GBM-microglia interactions.\n\nResultsMicroglia displayed an activated phenotype as a result of GBM crosstalk. Three-dimensional migration patterns of patient derived glioblastoma cells showed invasion was significantly decreased in response to microglia paracrine signaling. Potential molecular mechanisms underlying with this phenotype were identified from bioinformatic analysis of secretome and RNAseq data.\n\nConclusionThe data demonstrate a tissue engineered hydrogel platform can be used to investigate crosstalk between immune cells of the tumor microenvironment related to GBM progression. Such multidimensional models may provide valuable insight to inform therapeutic innovations to improve GBM treatment.",

These secondary lymphoid organs have been associated with the generation of an anti-tumor response. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal cancer types and the stromal architecture shapes the intratumoral heterogeneity. The stroma of PDAC is a complex system in which crosstalk takes place between cancer-associated fibroblasts, immune cells, endothelial cells and the cancer cells. Besides immune cells and fibroblasts, there is some limited data about the influence of nerve fibers on cancer progression.\n\nPatients and methodsNerve Fiber Density (NFD) was analysed in our cohort of 188 patients with Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma who underwent pancreatic surgery. We used immunohistochemistry and multiplex imaging to phenotype the immune cell infiltrate. The cell detection classifier measured distance from immune cell to cancer gland and with a heat map we could count TLS. By using Machine learning we were able to define the spatial distribution and counting Tertiary Lymphoid Structures.\n\nResultsHigh NFD is significantly associated with prolonged overall survival (HR 1.676 (95%CI 1.126,2.495) for low vs. high NFD, p-value 0.0109). The immune cells surrounding the nerve fibers were phenotyped in B cells, T cells and dendritic follicular cells, matching a TLS. Here we show that small nerve fibers are located at the TLS in Pancreatic Cancer and a high Nerve Fiber Density combined with more than 5 TLS is associated with a better survival (HR 0.388 (95%CI 0.218, 0.689).\n\nConclusionThe co-localization of small nerve fibers with TLS is a new finding which has not been described before. However the precise roles of these TLS and nerve fibers remains unknown. These findings unravel future pathways and has the potential to reach new directions into already existing targeted therapy.",

    "abstract": "Recurrence of metastatic breast cancer stemming from acquired endocrine and chemotherapy resistance remains a health burden for women with luminal (ER+) breast cancer. Disseminated ER+ tumor cells can remain viable but quiescent for years to decades. Contributing factors to metastatic spread include the maintenance and expansion of breast cancer stem cells (CSCs). Breast CSCs frequently exist as a minority population in therapy resistant tumors. In this study, we show that cytoplasmic complexes composed of steroid receptor (SR) co-activators, PELP1 and SRC-3, modulate breast CSC expansion through upregulation of the HIF-activated metabolic target genes PFKFB3 and PFKFB4. Seahorse metabolic assays demonstrated that cytoplasmic PELP1 influences cellular metabolism by increasing both glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. PELP1 interacts with PFKFB3 and PFKFB4 proteins, and inhibition of PFKFB3 and PFKFB4 kinase activity blocks PELP1-induced tumorspheres and protein-protein interactions with SRC-3. PFKFB4 knockdown inhibited in vivo emergence of circulating tumor cell (CTC) populations in mammary intraductal (MIND) models. Application of PFKFB inhibitors in combination with ER targeted therapies blocked tumorsphere formation in multiple models of advanced breast cancer, including tamoxifen (TamR) and paclitaxel (TaxR) resistant models and ER+ patient-derived organoids (PDxO). Together, our data suggest that PELP1, SRC-3, and PFKFBs cooperate to drive ER+ tumor cell populations that include CSCs and CTCs.\n\nSignificanceIdentifying non-ER pharmacological targets offers a useful approach to blocking metastatic escape from standard of care ER/estrogen (E2)-targeted strategies to overcome endocrine and chemotherapy resistance.",

    "abstract": "The tumor microenvironment (TME) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) restricts vascularization and, consequently, access to blood-derived nutrients and oxygen, which impacts tumor growth. Intracellular redox imbalance is another restraint on cellular proliferation, yet it is unknown if the TME contributes to the maintenance of redox homeostasis in PDA cells. Here, we demonstrate that the loss of mitochondrial glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase 2 (GOT2), a component in the malate-aspartate shuttle, disturbs redox homeostasis and halts proliferation of PDA cells in vitro. In contrast, GOT2 inhibition has no effect on in vivo tumor growth or tumorigenesis in an autochthonous model. We propose that this discrepancy is explained by heterocellular pyruvate exchange from the TME, including from cancer associated fibroblasts. More broadly, pyruvate similarly confers resistance to inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of pyruvate uptake or metabolism abrogated pyruvate-mediated alleviation of reductive stress from NADH buildup. In sum, this work describes a potential resistance mechanism mediated by metabolic crosstalk within the pancreatic TME. These findings have important implications for metabolic treatment strategies since several mitochondrial inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for PDA and other cancers.",

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a worldwide pandemic since the infection was first reported in China in December 2019. The aim of this study was to establish tonsil epithelial cell-derived organoids and to examine their feasibility as an ex vivo model for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using an optimized protocol, we achieved 3D tonsil organoid culture from human tonsil tissue that reflects the distinctive characteristics of the tonsil epithelium, such as its cellular composition, histologic properties, and molecular biological features. Notably, we verified that SARS-CoV-2 can infect tonsil organoids with a robust replication efficiency. Furthermore, treatment with remdesivir, an antiviral agent, effectively protected them from viral infection. Therefore, tonsil organoids could be available for investigation of SARS-CoV-2 infection-mediated pathology and for preclinical screening of novel antiviral drug candidates.\n\nOne-sentence SummaryThis study established tonsil epithelial cell-derived organoids and demonstrated their feasibility as an ex vivo model for SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

NPC proteins deliver cholesterol from endosomes to other compartments including trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) is a resident ER enzyme that converts cholesterol to cholesteryl esters for storage. Here, we report the surprising finding that in a mutant Npc1 mice, Acat1-deficiency delayed the onset of weight loss and declining motor skill, prolonged lifespan, delayed Purkinje neuron death, and improved hepatosplenic pathology. Furthermore, syntaxin 6, a cholesterol-binding t-SNARE normally localized to TGN, is mislocalized in mutant NPC cells. However, upon ACAT1 inhibition this mislocalization is corrected, and increase the level of a few proteins further downstream. Our results imply that ACAT1 inhibition diverts a cholesterol storage pool in a way that replenished the low cholesterol level in NPC-deficient TGN. Taking together, we identify ACAT1 inhibition as a potential therapeutic target for NPC treatment.",

Recent unexplained observations suggest that HGT rates in nature are linked with environmental dynamics, being high in static environments but surprisingly low in fluctuating environments. Here, using a geometric model of adaptation, we show that this trend might arise from evolutionary constraints. During adaptation in our model, a population of phenotype vectors aligns with a potentially fluctuating environmental vector while experiencing mutation, selection, drift and HGT. Simulations and theory reveal that HGT shapes a trade-off between the adaptation speed of populations and their fitness. This trade-off gives rise to an optimal HGT rate which decreases sharply with the rate of environmental fluctuations. Our results are consistent with data from natural populations, and strikingly suggest that HGT may sometimes carry a significant disadvantage for populations.",

In the Mimulus tilingii species complex, three species (M. caespitosa, M. minor, and M. tilingii) are largely allopatric and grow exclusively at high elevations (>2000m). The extent to which geographic separation has shaped patterns of divergence among the species is not well understood. In this study, we determined that the three species are morphologically and genetically distinct, yet recently diverged (<400kya). Additionally, we performed reciprocal crosses within and between the species and identified several strong postzygotic reproductive barriers, including hybrid seed inviability, F1 hybrid necrosis, and F1 hybrid male and female sterility. In this study, such postzygotic barriers are so strong that a cross between any species pair in the M. tilingii complex would cause nearly complete reproductive isolation. We consider how geographical and topographical patterns may have facilitated the evolution of several postzygotic barriers and contributed to speciation of closely related members within the M. tilingii species complex.",

The biotic interactions hypothesis proposes that greater species richness creates more ecological opportunity, driving faster evolution at low latitudes, whereas the \"empty niches\" hypothesis proposes that ecological opportunity is greater where diversity is low, spurring faster evolution at high latitudes. Here we tested these contrasting predictions by analyzing rates of bird beak evolution for a global dataset of 1141 sister pairs of birds. Beak size evolves at similar rates across latitudes, while beak shape evolves faster in the temperate zone, consistent with the empty niches hypothesis. We show in a meta-analysis that trait evolution and recent speciation rates are faster in the temperate zone, while rates of molecular evolution are slightly faster in the tropics. Our results suggest that drivers of evolutionary diversification are more potent at higher latitudes, thus calling into question multiple hypotheses invoking faster tropical evolution to explain the latitudinal diversity gradient.",

The convergent evolution of self-fertilization in three Caenorhabditis species provides a powerful lens to examine causes and consequences of mating system transitions. Among the selfers, C. tropicalis is the least genetically diverse and most afflicted by outbreeding depression. We generated a chromosomal-scale genome for C. tropicalis and surveyed global diversity. Population structure is very strong, and islands of extreme divergence punctuate a genomic background that is highly homogeneous around the globe. Outbreeding depression in the laboratory is caused largely by multiple gene drive elements, genetically consistent with maternal toxin/zygotic antidote systems. Driver loci harbor novel and duplicated genes, and their activity is modified by mito-nuclear background. Segregating drivers dramatically reduce fitness, and simulations show that selfing limits their spread. Frequent selfing in C. tropicalis may therefore be a strategy to avoid drive-mediated outbreeding depression.",

    "abstract": "Sex chromosomes are generally derived from a pair of autosomes that have acquired a locus controlling sex. Sex chromosomes usually evolve reduced recombination around this locus and undergo a long process of molecular divergence. Although sex chromosomes have been intensively studied in several model taxa, the actual loci controlling sex are difficult to identify in highly diverged sex chromosomes, hence they are known in relatively few species. Taxa with evolutionarily young sex chromosomes can help fill this gap in knowledge. Here we aimed at pinpointing the sex-determining region (SDR) of Armadillidium vulgare, a terrestrial isopod with female heterogamety (ZW females and ZZ males) and which presumably presents evolutionarily young sex chromosomes. To locate the SDR, we assessed SNP allele frequencies in F1 daughters and sons sequenced in pools (pool-seq) in several families. We developed a Bayesian method that uses the SNP genotypes of individually sequenced parents and poolseq data from F1 siblings to estimate the genetic distance between a given genomic region (contig) and the SDR. This allowed us to assign more than 43 Megabases of contigs to sex chromosomes. By taking advantage of the several F1 families, we delineated a very short genomic region (~65 kilobases) that did not show evidence for recombination with the SDR. In this region, the comparison of sequencing depths between sexes outlined female-specific genes that may be involved in sex determination. Overall, our results provide strong evidence for an extremely low divergence of sex chromosomes in A. vulgare.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInsecticides used in vector control mostly rely on vectors being exposed through contact with treated surfaces, yet little is known about the amount picked up by the insect. Measuring this amount is relevant not only for determining the actual doses that are lethal to the mosquito, but also for understanding effects on the physiology and vector competence of mosquitoes. Insecticides at sub-lethal doses can affect both parasites developing inside mosquitoes and mosquito microbiota, hence it is important to understand the processes by which parasites are exposed to insecticide inside the insect. These doses will inevitably depend on the amount of insecticide that mosquitoes pick up when they come into contact with treated nets.\n\nMethodsThree to five days old non-blood fed female Anopheles coluzzii mosquitoes were exposed to a long-lasting insecticidal net (PermaNet 2.0 containing 55 mg/m2 deltamethrin), using a wire ball frame, for 0.5-5.0 minutes. Our in-house developed colorimetric test was used to visually detect the amount of deltamethrin on different parts of the mosquito (legs, heads, thoraxes, abdomens) following exposure to the net. The amount of insecticide picked up by mosquitoes from the net over a range of exposure times was measured using a high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection (HPLC-DAD).\n\nResultsThe colorimetric test, designed to only detect the type 2 pyrethroids (i.e deltamethrin, -cypermethrin and {lambda}-cyhalothrin) on fabrics (e.g. ITNs) and sprayed walls, was successfully used for the first time to detect deltamethrin on mosquitoes following exposure to the net. The confirmatory HPLC-DAD analysis determined that after 2 min exposure up to 12 ng of deltamethrin adhered to mosquitoes following exposure to PermaNet 2.0 (mean = 5.2 ng/mosquito, SE = 1.9) and that the final dose depends on the length of exposure time.\n\nConclusionsThis study demonstrated the potential of a screening (type 2 pyrethroid colorimetric test) and a confirmatory test (HPLC-DAD) to determine the amount of insecticide that adheres to mosquitoes on contact with treated surfaces. This has implications for a precise lethal dose determination and detection of specific insecticide that causes the greatest mosquito mortality in circumstances where mixtures of insecticides may be used to maximise effectiveness of interventions.",

    "abstract": "Robust estimation of the number, location, and activity of multiple correlated brain sources has long been a challenging task in electromagnetic brain imaging from M/EEG data, one that is significantly impacted by interference from spontaneous brain activity, sensor noise, and other sources of artifacts. Recently, we introduced the Champagne algorithm, a novel Bayesian inference algorithm that has shown tremendous success in M/EEG source reconstruction. Inherent to Champagne and most other related Bayesian reconstruction algorithms is the assumption that the noise covariance in sensor data can be estimated from \"baseline\" or \"control\" measurements. However, in many scenarios, such baseline data is not available, or is unreliable, and it is unclear how best to estimate the noise covariance. In this technical note, we propose several robust methods to estimate the contributions to sensors from noise arising from outside the brain without the need for additional baseline measurements. The incorporation of these methods for noise covariance estimation improves the robust reconstruction of complex brain source activity under high levels of noise and interference, while maintaining the performance features of Champagne. Specifically, we show that the resulting algorithm, Champagne with noise learning, is quite robust to initialization and is computationally efficient. In simulations, performance of the proposed noise learning algorithm is consistently superior to Champagne without noise learning. We also demonstrate that, even without the use of any baseline data, Champagne with noise learning is able to reconstruct complex brain activity with just a few trials or even a single trial, demonstrating significant improvements in source reconstruction for electromagnetic brain imaging.",

    "abstract": "The novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic resulting in nearly 20 million infections across the globe, as of August 2020. Critical to the rapid evaluation of vaccines and antivirals is the development of tractable animal models of infection. The use of common laboratory strains of mice to this end is hindered by significant divergence of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the receptor required for entry of SARS-CoV-2. In the current study, we designed and utilized an mRNA-based transfection system to induce expression of the hACE2 receptor in order to confer entry of SARS-CoV-2 in otherwise non-permissive cells. By employing this expression system in an in vivo setting, we were able to interrogate the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in type 1 interferon receptor deficient mice. In doing so, we showed that the T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 is enhanced when hACE2 is expressed during infection. Moreover, we demonstrated that these responses are preserved in memory and are boosted upon secondary infection. Interestingly, we did not observe an enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses with hACE2 induction. Importantly, using this system, we functionally identified the CD4+ and CD8+ peptide epitopes targeted during SARS-CoV-2 infection in H2b restricted mice. Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in mice of this MHC haplotype primarily target peptides of the spike and membrane proteins, while the antigen-specific CD4+ T cells target peptides of the nucleocapsid, membrane, and spike proteins. The functional identification of these T cell epitopes will be critical for evaluation of vaccine efficacy in murine models of SARS-CoV-2. The use of this tractable expression system has the potential to be used in other instances of emerging infections in which the rapid development of an animal model is hindered by a lack of host susceptibility factors.",

    "abstract": "Implementation of non-commercial in-house methods into routine clinical diagnostics becomes more challenging, because these methods are not internationally standardized, most of the research in that field is underfunded and recommendations for their use is lacking. We conducted a study, where all the technicians were previously unfamiliar to the Colour Test (CT), a colorimetric redox indicator and thin-layer agar based Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex diagnosis and direct drug susceptibility testing (DST) method, and tested whether the performance of this in-house method is dependent on experience of the laboratory personnel.\n\nAfter a two-day hands-on training, six panels of 150 M. tuberculosis isolates were cultured onto CT plates prepared in-house by six technicians in two laboratories. Finally, triplicate readings of 900 CT plates resulted 18 DST patterns for each of the initial isolates. The results were compared to each other and the gold standard of BACTEC MGIT 960 DST results.\n\nThe median time to produce M. tuberculosis CT DST results for three antituberculosis drugs was 13 days. The overall ability to correctly define phenotypic resistance ranged from 94.7% for levofloxacin to 95.8% and 97.3% for isoniazid and rifampicin, respectively. The test specificities were even higher exceeding 97% for all three drugs tested. Interobserver agreement reached 100% in one of the laboratories and exceeded 97% for levofloxacin and 99% for isoniazid and rifampicin in the second laboratory.\n\nThe implementation of the CT into a new laboratory was straightforward with only minimal guidance. This study proves that the CT is highly reproducible and easily interpreted by previously inexperienced personnel.",

    "abstract": "Active volcanoes in Antarctica, in contrast to the rest of the icy landscape, have remarkable temperature and geochemical gradients that could select for a wide variety of microbial adaptive mechanisms and metabolic pathways. Deception Island is a stratovolcano flooded by the sea, resulting in contrasting ecosystems such as permanent glaciers (<0 {degrees}C) and active fumaroles (up to 100 {degrees}C). Steep gradients in temperature, salinity and geochemistry over very short distances have been reported for Deception Island, and have been shown to effect microbial community structure and diversity. However, little is known regarding how these gradients affect ecosystem functioning, for example due to inhibition of key metabolic enzymes or pathways. In this study, we used shotgun metagenomics and metagenome-assembled genomes to explore how microbial functional diversity is shaped by extreme geochemical, salinity and temperature gradients in fumarole and glacier sediments. We observed that microbial communities from a 98 {degrees}C fumarole harbor specific hyperthermophilic molecular strategies, as well as reductive and autotrophic pathways, while those from <80 {degrees}C fumaroles possess more diverse metabolic and survival strategies capable of responding to fluctuating redox and temperature conditions. In contrast, glacier communities showed less diverse metabolic potentials, comprising mainly heterotrophic and carbon pathways. Through the reconstruction of genomes, we were able to clarify putative novel lifestyles of underrepresented taxonomic groups, especially those related to Nanoarchaeota and thermophilic ammonia-oxidizing archaeal lineages. Our results enhance understanding of the metabolic and survival capabilities of different extremophilic lineages of Bacteria and Archaea.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) emerged in November, 2019 in China and rapidly became pandemic. As with other coronaviruses, a preponderance of evidence suggests the virus originated in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) and likely underwent a recombination event in an intermediate host prior to entry into human populations. A significant concern is that SARS-CoV-2 could become established in secondary reservoir hosts outside of Asia. To assess this potential, we challenged deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) with SARS-CoV-2 and found robust virus replication in the upper respiratory tract, lungs and intestines, with detectable viral RNA for up to 21 days in oral swabs and 14 days in lungs. Virus entry into the brain also occurred, likely via gustatory-olfactory-trigeminal pathway with eventual compromise to the blood brain barrier. Despite this, no conspicuous signs of disease were observed and no deer mice succumbed to infection. Expression of several innate immune response genes were elevated in the lungs, notably IFN, Cxcl10, Oas2, Tbk1 and Pycard. Elevated CD4 and CD8{beta} expression in the lungs was concomitant with Tbx21, IFN{gamma} and IL-21 expression, suggesting a type I inflammatory immune response. Contact transmission occurred from infected to naive deer mice through two passages, showing sustained natural transmission. In the second deer mouse passage, an insertion of 4 amino acids occurred to fixation in the N-terminal domain of the spike protein that is predicted to form a solvent-accessible loop. Subsequent examination of the source virus from BEI Resources indicated the mutation was present at very low levels, demonstrating potent purifying selection for the insert during in vivo passage. Collectively, this work has determined that deer mice are a suitable animal model for the study of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, and that they have the potential to serve as secondary reservoir hosts that could lead to periodic outbreaks of COVID-19 in North America.",

This approach, termed MA-GenTA: Microbial Abundances from Genome Tagged Analysis, enables quantitative, straightforward, cost-effective microbiome profiling that combines desirable features of both 16S rRNA and mWGS strategies. To test the utility of the MA-GenTA assay, probes were designed for 830 genome sequences representing bacteria present in mouse stool specimens. Comparison of the MA-GenTA data with mWGS data demonstrated excellent correlation down to 0.01% relative abundance and a similar number of organisms detected per sample. Despite the incompleteness of the reference database, NMDS clustering based on the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity metric of sample groups was consistent between MA-GenTA, mWGS and 16S rRNA datasets. MA-GenTA represents a potentially useful new method for microbiome community profiling based on reference genomes.",

    "abstract": "In the mature CNS, netrin-1 is expressed by neurons and oligodendrocytes and implicated in the stability of axo-oligodendroglial paranodal junctions. Here we report that the netrin receptor UNC5B is highly expressed by mature oligodendrocytes and enriched at paranodes. We demonstrate that paranodes become disorganized following conditional deletion of UNC5B in oligodendrocytes, with disruption of the interface between glial loops and detachment of loops from the axon. As a result, Caspr1 and Kv1.1 disperse along the axon, internodes fail to lengthen and compact myelin periodicity is reduced. Paranodal and axoglial domain disorganization progressively worsens and a delay in motor learning develops in aged mice lacking oligodendroglial UNC5B. Altered glial loop ultrastructure and reduced levels of claudin-11 and JAM-C tight junction proteins support the conclusion that disruption of autotypic junctions between paranodal loops underlies paranode disorganization. Our findings reveal an essential contribution of oligodendroglial UNC5B at paranodes that is required for the stability of mature myelin.",

    "abstract": "Voluntary movements are usually preceded by a slow, negative-going brain signal over motor areas, the so-called readiness potential (RP). To date, the exact nature and causal role of the RP in movement preparation have remained heavily debated. One important open question is whether people can exert conscious control over their RP, for example by learning to suppress it. If people were able to initiate spontaneous movements without eliciting an RP, this would challenge the idea that the RP is a necessary stage of the causal chain leading up to a voluntary movement. We tested the ability of participants to control the magnitude of their RP in a neurofeedback experiment. Participants performed self-initiated movements and after every movement they were provided with immediate feedback about the magnitude of their RP. They were asked to find a mental strategy to perform voluntary movements such that the RPs were as small as possible. We found no evidence that participants were able to to willfully modulate or suppress their RPs while still eliciting voluntary movements. This suggests that the RP might be an involuntary component of voluntary action over which people cannot exert conscious control.",

    "abstract": "The response of wild plants towards climate warming is taxa specific, but overgrazing could also be a determining factor for the alpine ecosystems. Overgrazing and climate warming are important drivers of alpine grassland degradation worldwide. Local indigenous peoples will be the first impacted by such degradation due to impacts on animal production and the availability of local medicinal plants. Studies on plant responses to overgrazing and climate change are rarely performed to assess threats to these biological and cultural systems. Long-term observations or manipulative experiments are promising, but rarely use strategies to evaluate the sensitivity and vulnerability of such ecosystems to climatic change. We studied the combined effects of overgrazing and increased temperatures on culturally important medicinal plants of Khunjerab National Park, Pakistan. Three experimental treatments were used (control, warming through an open-top chamber, and exclusion of grazing animals vs. the control). These experimental plots were installed at different elevations (3352-4969 m) and were monitored routinely. Grazing reduced vegetation cover & biomass by 2.3% and 6.26%, respectively, but that was not significant due to the high variability among study plots. However, warming significantly increased the overall percentage cover and biomass of all target plant species, ranging from 1{+/-}0.6% in Bistorta officinalis to 18.7 {+/-} 4.9% in Poa alpina. Thus, warming may increase the availability of therapeutic plants for indigenous people while overgrazing would have deteriorating effects locally. This research illustrates that vegetation sensitivity to warming and overgrazing is likely to affect man- environment relationships, and traditional knowledge on a regional scale.",

    "abstract": "Cyp33 is an essential human cyclophilin prolyl isomerase that plays myriad roles in splicing and chromatin remodeling. In addition to a canonical cyclophilin (Cyp) domain, Cyp33 contains an RNA-recognition motif (RRM) domain, and RNA-binding triggers proline isomerase activity. One prominent role for Cyp33 is through a direct interaction with the mixed lineage leukemia protein 1 (MLL1, also known as KMT2A) complex, which is a histone methyltransferase that serves as a global regulator of human transcription. MLL activity is regulated by Cyp33, which isomerizes a key proline in the linker between the PHD3 and Bromo domains of MLL1, acting as a switch between gene activation and repression. The direct interaction between MLL1 and Cyp33 is critical, as deletion of the MLL1-PHD3 domain responsible for this interaction results in oncogenesis. The Cyp33 RRM is central to these activities, as it binds both the PHD3 domain and RNA. To better understand how RNA binding drives the action of Cyp33, we performed RNA-SELEX against full-length Cyp33 accompanied by deep sequencing. We have identified an enriched Cyp33 binding motif (AAUAAUAA) broadly represented in the cellular RNA pool as well as tightly binding RNA aptamers with affinities comparable and competitive with the Cyp33 MLL1-PHD3 interaction. RNA binding extends beyond the canonical RRM domain, but not to the Cyp domain, suggesting an indirect mechanism of interaction. NMR chemical shift mapping confirms an overlapping, but not identical, interface on Cyp33 for RNA and PHD3 binding. This finding suggests RNA can disrupt the gene repressive Cyp33-MLL1 complex providing another layer of regulation for chromatin remodeling by MLL1.",

Although this difference appears to result from rapid adaptation to captivity, it is not known what traits are under selection. We hypothesize that variation in traits that confer a growth rate advantage to some individuals in the novel hatchery environment are under strong selection because survival at sea is correlated with size at release. Here we show that full sibling families of steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) show substantial variation in propensity to feed at the surface as fry, and that the more surface-oriented families grew faster under hatchery conditions. We hypothesize that surface-oriented fry gain an initial growth advantage that persists through size at release. Because surface orientation is a correlate of generalized boldness, hatcheries may inadvertently select for that phenotype, which could explain the fitness differences observed between hatchery and natural-origin fish in the wild.",

    "abstract": "The discovery that a naturally occurring, biologically active {beta}-carotene-oxygen copolymer compound is the main product formed in spontaneously oxidized {beta}-carotene has stimulated interest in its potential health benefits. The copolymer, formed in nature or synthetically by the air-oxidation of {beta}-carotene, possesses beneficial immune modulating activities that previously had been attributed to {beta}-carotene itself. Support for these benefits is provided by previous studies showing that supplementation in feed with low parts-per-million levels of copolymer-rich, fully oxidized {beta}-carotene (OxBC) helped reduce the negative impact of subclinical necrotic enteritis in broilers and improved growth in weaned piglets. To further assess these potential benefits, two trials were conducted in swine raised under commercial conditions in Vietnam. Trial 1, a 140-day full-grow, post-wean study with 500 28-day-old pigs, compared 2, 4 or 8 ppm OxBC against both an unsupplemented and an antibiotic control group. OxBC and antibiotics each improved growth rate, feed efficiency, and body weight compared to the control (P<0.001). Animals receiving 4 and 8 ppm OxBC performed better than did animals on antibiotics (P<0.001). In starter pigs, OxBC reduced the occurrence of diarrhea dose-dependently (4 and 8 ppm) and to a greater extent than did antibiotics (P<0.001). Trial 2, a 49-day study with 420 piglets, was conducted in two-stages. In Stage 1 (pre-wean), OxBC in the transition (creep) feed produced a dose-dependent trend toward increased body weight over 21 days, reaching significance at the highest inclusion level (16 ppm) (P<0.001). In Stage 2 (post-wean), body weight gain showed a dose-dependent trend and was significant for both 8 ppm OxBC and the antibiotics at 28 days post-wean (P<0.001). Feed conversion was better at 8 ppm OxBC and for the antibiotic group (P<0.001). These findings support the concept that {beta}-carotene-oxygen copolymers help optimize immune function, and provide validation for the effectiveness of this strategy in enhancing animal performance in the absence of in-feed antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium vivax is responsible for the majority of malaria cases outside Africa. Unlike P. falciparum, the P. vivax life-cycle includes a dormant liver stage, the hypnozoite, which can cause infection in the absence of mosquito transmission. An effective vaccine against P. vivax blood stages would limit symptoms and pathology from such recurrent infections, and therefore could play a critical role in the control of this species. Vaccine development in P. vivax, however, lags considerably behind P. falciparum, which has many identified targets with several having transitioned to Phase II testing. By contrast only one P. vivax blood-stage vaccine candidate based on the Duffy Binding Protein (PvDBP), has reached Phase Ia, in large part because the lack of a continuous in vitro culture system for P. vivax limits systematic screening of new candidates. We used the close phylogenetic relationship between P. vivax and P. knowlesi, for which an in vitro culture system in human erythrocytes exists, to test the scalability of systematic reverse vaccinology to identify and prioritise P. vivax blood-stage targets. A panel of P. vivax proteins predicted to function in erythrocyte invasion were expressed as full-length recombinant ectodomains in a mammalian expression system. Eight of these antigens were used to generate polyclonal antibodies, which were screened for their ability to recognize orthologous proteins in P. knowlesi. These antibodies were then tested for inhibition of growth and invasion of both wild type P. knowlesi and chimeric P. knowlesi lines modified using CRISPR/Cas9 to exchange P. knowlesi genes with their P. vivax orthologues. Candidates that induced antibodies that inhibited invasion to a similar level as PvDBP were identified, confirming the utility of P. knowlesi as a model for P. vivax vaccine development and prioritizing antigens for further follow up.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYMalaria parasites cause disease after invading human red blood cells, implying that a vaccine that interrupts this process could play a significant role in malaria control. Multiple Plasmodium parasite species can cause malaria in humans, and most malaria outside Africa is caused by Plasmodium vivax. There is currently no effective vaccine against the blood stage of any malaria parasite, and progress in P. vivax vaccine development has been particularly hampered because this parasite species cannot be cultured for prolonged periods of time in the lab. We explored whether a related species, P. knowlesi, which can be propagated in human red blood cells in vitro, can be used to screen for potential P. vivax vaccine targets. We raised antibodies against selected P. vivax proteins and testedtheir ability to recognize and prevent P. knowlesi parasites from invading human red blood cells, thereby identifying multiple novel vaccine candidates.",

    "abstract": "Phagocytic amoeboid predators such as amoeba have been proposed to select for survival traits in soil microbes such as Cryptococcus neoformans that can also function in animal virulence by defeating phagocytic immune cells, such as macrophages. Several prior studies have shown that incubation of various fungal species with amoeba can enhance their virulence. However, the mechanisms by which fungi adapt to amoeba and thus change their virulence are unknown. In this study we exposed three strains of C. neoformans (1 clinical and 2 environmental) to predation by Acanthamoeba castellanii for prolonged periods of time and then analyzed surviving colonies phenotypically and genetically. Surviving colonies were comprised of cells that expressed either pseudohyphal or yeast phenotypes, which demonstrated variable expression of such traits associated with virulence such as capsule size, urease production and melanization. Phenotypic changes were associated with aneuploidy and DNA sequence mutations in some amoeba-passaged isolates, but not in others. Mutations in the gene encoding for the oligopeptide transporter (CNAG_03013; OPT1) were observed among amoeba-passaged isolates from each of the three strains. In addition, isolates derived from environmental strains gained the capacity for enhanced macrophage toxicity after amoeba selection and carried mutations on the CNAG_00570 gene, which encodes Pkr1 (AMP-dependent protein kinase regulator) but were less virulence in mice because they elicited more effective fungal-clearing immune responses. Our results indicate that C. neoformans survival under constant amoeba predation involves the generation of strains expressing pleiotropic phenotypic and genetic changes, which confer increase resistance against protozoal predation. Given the myriad of potential predators in soils the diversity observed among amoeba-selected strains suggests a bet-hedging strategy whereby variant diversity increases the likelihood that some will survive predation.\n\nAuthor summaryCryptococcus neoformans is a ubiquitous environmental fungus that is also a leading cause of fatal fungal infection in humans, especially among immunocompromised patients. Cryptococcosis is a worldwide concern due to its high mortality rate. A major question in the field is how an environmental yeast such as C. neoformans becomes a human pathogen when it has no need for animal host in its life cycle. Previous studies showed evidence that C. neoformans increases its pathogenicity after interacting with its environmental predator amoebae. Amoebae behave like macrophages, an important immune cell in human body, so it is considered as a training ground for pathogens to resist macrophages. However, how C. neoformans changes its virulence through interacting with amoebae is unknown. Here, we exposed C. neoformans to amoebae for a long period of time. We found that C. neoformans cells recovered from amoebae manifested numerous changes to phenotypes related to its virulence and one of the amoeba-passaged C. neoformans cells had enhanced ability to kill macrophages. We further analyzed their genome sequences and found various mutations in different cells of amoeba-passaged C. neoformans, showing that DNA mutations may be the major cause of the phenotypic changes after interacting with amoebae. Our study indicates that fungal survival in the face of amoeba predation is associated with the emergence of pleiotropic phenotypic and genomic changes that increase the chance of fungal survival.",

    "abstract": "Rapid screening for stroke in pre-hospital settings may improve patient outcomes by allowing early deployment of thrombolytic therapies. Near-infrared hybrid diffuse optical screening devices may fill this need. This study seeks to determine whether hybrid diffuse optical measurements can measure hemodynamic changes associated with cerebral ischemia within the first few hours of the onset of acute ischemia in a large animal model. A hybrid diffuse optical device combining of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) was fabricated to measure total hemoglobin concentration (HbT), tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) and blood flow index (BFI). Cerebral ischemia was induced by ligation of the bilateral common carotid arteries (CCA) in five miniature pigs. Additionally, a fatal stroke was induced in two pigs by injecting 5ml air emboli into both CCA. Cerebral hemodynamic parameters were monitored continuously throughout the study with the hybrid optical device. Relative changes BFI showed the good repeatability both of the ligation and fatal stroke experiments. During bilateral CCA ligation, the BFI decreased by up to about 66% of baseline values; during the fatal stroke experiment, the BFI decreased by up to about 95%, with a temporal resolution of 20 seconds. To the best of our knowledge, there are not existing methods which can measure the cerebral ischemia within the first few hours of the onset noninvasively. The MRI scanning was conducted at 24 h post injury. However, the images showed no abnormality. The results show the hybrid diffuse optical method can immediately measure the hemodynamic changes of miniature pigs in the first few hours of each single cerebral ischemia onset, and the BFI may be the promising biomarker to distinguish the cerebral ischemia and cerebral death.",

    "abstract": "Autochthonous Sudanese cattle breeds, namely Baggara for beef and Butana and Kenana for dairy, are characterized by their adaptive characteristics and high performance in hot and dry agro-ecosystems, are used largely by nomadic and semi-nomadic pastoralists. Here we analyzed the diversity and genetic structure of the BoLA-DRB3 gene, a genetic locus linked to the immune response, for the indigenous cattle of Sudan and in the context of the global cattle repository. Blood samples (n=225) were taken from three indigenous breeds (Baggara; n=113, Butana; n= 60 and Kenana; n=52) distributed across six regions of Sudan. Nucleotide sequences were genotyped using the sequence-based typing method. Sequence electropherograms were analyzed using the Assign SBT software. We describe 53 alleles, including seven new, novel alleles. In the Baggara breed the number of alleles was 46 (40 previously reported and six new ones), 33 in the Kenana breed (28 previously reported and five new ones), and 33 in the Butana breed (28 previously reported and five new ones). Venn analysis of Sudanese breeds with Southeast Asian, European and American cattle showed 115 alleles of which 14 were unique to Sudanese breeds. Three of the alleles exhibited gene frequency of > 0.5%, representing 26% of the 53 alleles detected in the native Sudanese cattle. Observed versus expected heterozygosity was higher than 0.93 in all three breeds analyzed and equilibrium status revealed by Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium suggests pure genetic drift. Gene frequency distributions of Baggara cattle showed an even distribution (P = 0.016), consistent with the theoretical proportion expected under balancing selection pressure as opposed to positive or neutral selection. In contrast, Butana and Kenana cattle (P = 0.225 and P = 0.138, respectively) were more congruent with neutral selection, similar to the results obtained for most of the cattle breeds analyzed so far. Sudanese cattle breeds were located within a narrow cloud in an intermediate position between the Zebu and Taurine breeds and close to other Southeast Asian breeds, in accordance with the composite origin of these native breeds, which is also reinforced by the presence of African and Zebu unique BoLA-DRB3 alleles within these breeds. The results of the Principal Component Analysis were in agreement with the overall clustering pattern observed on the NJ and/or UPGMA trees. These results contribute to our understanding of the genetic diversity and distribution pattern of BoLA-DRB3 gene alleles in Sudanese cattle breeds and provide insight into their uniqueness in their ability to survive arrays of tropical diseases and reproduce well in Sudans harsh environment.\n\nAuthor summaryAfrican cattle survive and adapt to a variety of diseases via acquired immunity capable of presenting antigens through the function of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) or bovine leukocyte antigen (BoLA) in cattle. The aim of this study was to investigate how the immune system is structured and to what extent three economically important breeds in Sudan differ from exotic cattle. Here, we use the sequence-based typing approach to analyze BoLA-DRB3s genetic diversity linked to immunity against complex diseases that infect cattle. By examining 225 indigenous cattle belonging to three breeds in Sudan, we demonstrate that these cattle are unique from all known cattle by identifying seven new alleles; BoLA-DRB3*004:02Sp, BoLA-DRB3*011:02Sp, BoLA-DRB3*018:01Sp, BoLA-DRB3*021:01sp, BoLA-DRB3*024:18Sp, BoLA-DRB3*027:05sp, and BoLA-DRB3*032:01sp. When analyzing frequency of the protein pockets implicated in the antigen-binding function of the MHC complex by PCA we found that pockets 4 and 9 are the ones that best differentiate these native breeds from the rest. This may be attributed to high disease tolerance/susceptibility to tropical infections, such as those carried by ticks and intestinal parasites. Further studies are needed on these newly identified variants and their association with specific common disease(s). This finding is especially important for disease resistance/susceptibility association to help advise on candidate animals in selection schemes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundChronic stress-related illnesses, such as major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder share symptomatology, including anxiety, anhedonia, and helplessness. Across disorders, neurotoxic dysregulated glutamate (Glu) signaling may underlie symptom emergence. Current first-line antidepressant drugs, which do not directly target Glu signaling, fail to provide adequate benefit for many patients and are associated with high relapse rates. Riluzole modulates glutamatergic neurotransmission by increasing metabolic cycling and modulating signal transduction. Clinical studies exploring riluzoles efficacy in stress-related disorders have provided varied results. However, the utility of riluzole for treating specific symptom dimensions or as a prophylactic treatment has not been comprehensively assessed.\n\nMethodsWe investigated whether chronic prophylactic riluzole (~12-15mg/kg/day p.o.) could prevent the emergence of behavioral deficits induced by unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) in mice. We assessed: i) anxiety-like behavior using the elevated-plus maze, open field test, and novelty-suppressed feeding, ii) mixed anxiety/anhedonia-like behavior in the novelty-induced hypophagia test and, iii) anhedonia-like behavior using the sucrose consumption test. Z-scoring summarized changes across tests measuring similar dimensions. In a separate learned helplessness (LH) cohort, we investigated whether chronic prophylactic riluzole treatment could block the development of helplessness-like behavior.\n\nResultsUCMS induced an elevation in anhedonia-like behavior, and overall behavioral emotionality that was blocked by prophylactic riluzole. In the LH cohort, prophylactic riluzole blocked the development of helplessness-like behavior.\n\nConclusionThis study supports the utility of riluzole as a prophylactic medication for preventing anhedonia, and helplessness symptoms associated with stress-related disorders.",

    "abstract": "The functional organization of diverse retinal ganglion cell (RGC) types, which shapes the visual signal transmitted to the brain, has been examined in many species. The unique spatial, temporal, and chromatic properties of the numerically dominant RGC types in macaque monkey retina are presumed to most accurately model human vision. However, the functional similarity between RGCs in macaques and humans has only begun to be tested, and recent work suggests possible differences. Here, the properties of the numerically dominant human RGC types were examined using large-scale multi-electrode recordings with fine-grained visual stimulation in isolated retina, and compared to results from dozens of recordings from macaque retina using the same experimental methods and conditions. The properties of four major human RGC types -- ON-parasol, OFF-parasol, ON-midget, and OFF-midget -- closely paralleled those of the same macaque RGC types, including the spatial and temporal light sensitivity, precisely coordinated mosaic organization of receptive fields, ON-OFF asymmetries, spatial response nonlinearity, and sampling of photoreceptor inputs over space. Putative smooth monostratified cells and polyaxonal amacrine cells were also identified based on similarities to cell types previously identified in macaque retina. The results suggest that recently proposed differences between human and macaque RGCs probably reflect experimental differences, and that the macaque model provides an accurate picture of human RGC function.",

    "abstract": "Many cells and tissues exhibit chirality that stems from the chirality of proteins and polymers. In the C. elegans zygote actomyosin contractility drives chiral rotation of the entire cortex circumferentially around the division plane during anaphase. How contractility is translated to cell-scale chirality, and what dictates handedness, are unknown. Septins are candidate contributors to cell-scale chirality because they anchor and crosslink the actomyosin cytoskeleton. We report that septins are required for anaphase cortical rotation. In contrast, the formin CYK-1, which we found to be enriched in the posterior in early anaphase, is not required for cortical rotation, but contributes to its chirality. Simultaneous loss of septin and CYK-1 function led to abnormal and often reversed cortical rotation. Our results suggest that anaphase contractility leads to chiral rotation by releasing torsional stress generated during formin-based polymerization, which is polarized along the cell anterior-posterior axis, and which accumulates due to actomyosin network connectivity. Our findings shed light on the molecular and physical bases for cellular chirality in the C. elegans zygote. We also identify conditions in which chiral rotation fails but animals are developmentally viable, opening avenues for future work on the relationship between early embryonic cellular chirality and animal body plan.",

    "abstract": "Many genes are regulated by two or more enhancers that drive similar expression patterns. Evolutionary theory suggests that these seemingly redundant enhancers must have functionally important differences. In the simple ascidian chordate Ciona, the transcription factor Brachyury is induced exclusively in the presumptive notochord downstream of lineage specific regulators and FGF-responsive Ets family transcription factors. Here we exploit the ability to finely titrate FGF signaling activity via the MAPK pathway using the MEK inhibitor U0126 to quantify the dependence of transcription driven by different Brachyury reporter constructs on this direct upstream regulator. We find that the more powerful promoter-adjacent proximal enhancer and a weaker distal enhancer have fundamentally different dose-response relationships to MAPK inhibition. The Distal enhancer is more sensitive to MAPK inhibition but shows a less cooperative response, whereas the Proximal enhancer is less sensitive and more cooperative. A longer construct containing both enhancers has a complex dose-response curve that supports the idea that the proximal and distal enhancers are moderately super-additive. We show that the overall expression loss from intermediate doses of U0126 is not only a function of the fraction of cells expressing these reporters, but also involves graded decreases in expression at the single-cell level. Expression of the endogenous gene shows a comparable dose-response relationship to the full length reporter, and we find that different notochord founder cells are differentially sensitive to MAPK inhibition. Together, these results indicate that although the two Brachyury enhancers have qualitatively similar expression patterns, they respond to FGF in quantitatively different ways and act together to drive high levels of Brachyury expression with a characteristic input/output relationship. This indicates that they are fundamentally not redundant genetic elements.",

Persistence of wild populations and the recent emergence of a second independently evolved transmissible cancer suggest that transmissible cancers may be a recurrent feature in devils. Here we compared signatures of selection across temporal scales to determine whether genes or gene pathways under contemporary selection (6-8 generations) have also been subject to historical selection (65-85 million years), and test for recurrent selection in devils. First, we used a targeted sequencing approach, RAD-capture, to identify genomic regions subject to rapid evolution in approximately 2,500 devils in six populations as DFTD spread across the species range. We documented genome-wide contemporary evolution, including 186 candidate genes related to cell cycling and immune response. Then we used a molecular evolution approach to identify historical positive selection in devils compared to other marsupials and found evidence of selection in 1,773 genes. However, we found limited overlap across time scales, with historical selection detected in only 16 contemporary candidate genes, and no overlap in enriched functional gene sets. Our results are consistent with a novel, multi-locus evolutionary response of devils to DFTD. Our results can inform management actions to conserve adaptive potential of devils by identifying high priority targets for genetic monitoring and maintenance of functional diversity in managed populations.",

    "abstract": "During their infective stages, hookworms release excretory-secretory (E-S) products, including small molecules and proteins, to help evade and suppress the hosts immune system. Small molecules found in E-S products of mammalian hookworms include nematode derived metabolites like ascarosides, which are composed of the sugar ascarylose linked to a fatty acid side chain. Ascarosides play vital roles in signaling, development, reproduction, and survival. The most abundant proteins found in hookworm E-S products are members of the protein family known as Ancylostoma secreted protein (ASP). ASP belongs to the SCP/TAPS (sperm-coating protein / Tpx / antigen 5 / pathogenesis related-1 / Sc7) superfamily of proteins, members of which have previously been shown to bind to eicosanoids and fatty acids. These molecules are structurally similar to the fatty acid moieties of ascarosides. The objective of this study was to determine if the hookworm ASP; N. americanus Ancylostoma secreted protein 2 (Na-ASP-2) binds to the ascarosides or their fatty acid moieties. We describe investigations of our hypothesis that there is a functional relationship between the major secreted proteins and signaling small molecules found in hookworm E-S products. To accomplish this, several ascarosides and their fatty acid moieties were synthesized and tested for in vitro binding to Na-ASP-2 using a ligand competition assay and microscale thermophoresis. Our results reveal that the fatty acid moieties of the ascarosides, bind specifically to the palmitic acid binding cavity of Na-ASP-2. Additionally, ascr#3, an ascaroside that is present in mammalian hookworm E-S products binds to the palmitic acid binding cavity of Na-ASP-2, whereas oscr#10 which is not found in hookworm E-S products does not bind. Future studies are required to determine the structural basis of ascaroside binding by Na-ASP-2 and to understand the physiological significance of these observations.",

We found boundary conditions applied to high density collagen gels were capable of driving tenocytes, ligament fibroblasts, and meniscal fibrochondrocytes to develop native-sized hierarchical collagen fibers 20-40 {micro}m in diameter. The collagen fibers organize similar to native collagen with native fibril banding patterns and hierarchical fiber bundles 50-350 {micro}m in diameter by 6 weeks. Mirroring fiber organization, tensile properties of restrained samples improved significantly with time, reaching [~]1 MPa. Additionally, tendon, ligament, and meniscal cells produced significantly different sized fibers, different degrees of crimp, and different GAG concentrations, which corresponded with respective native tissue. To our knowledge, these are some of the largest, most organized fibers produced to date in vitro. Further, cells produced tissue specific hierarchical fibers, suggesting this system is a promising tool to better understand cellular regulation of fiber formation to better stimulate it in vivo after injury.",

Colonization with non-responder microbiota led to reduced tumor immune cell infiltration and modified antigen presenting cell phenotype. RNA sequencing of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells revealed enrichment for stem cell-like genes in non-responders and reduced effector-like expression conferring cytotoxic potential. Antibiotic depletion and microbiota transplant restored anti-PD-L1 response in non-responders, with expansion of effector cells and cytotoxicity. Concomitant blockade of TNF similarly improved response to anti-PD-L1 and increased cytotoxicity.

Here we develop a related method called Fast Estimation of Effective Migration Surfaces (FEEMS). FEEMS uses a Gaussian Markov Random Field in a penalized likelihood framework that allows for efficient optimization and output of effective migration surfaces. Further, the efficient optimization facilitates the inference of migration parameters per edge in the graph, rather than per node (as in EEMS). When tested with coalescent simulations, FEEMS accurately recovers effective migration surfaces with complex gene-flow histories, including those with anisotropy. Applications of FEEMS to population genetic data from North American gray wolves shows it to perform comparably to EEMS, but with solutions obtained orders of magnitude faster. Overall, FEEMS expands the ability of users to quickly visualize and interpret spatial structure in their data.",

    "abstract": "Many organisms evolved strategies to survive and thrive under extreme desiccation. Plant seeds protect dehydrated embryos from a variety of stressors and can even lay dormant for millennia. While hydration is the key trigger that reactivates metabolism and kick-starts germination, the exact mechanism by which the embryo senses water remains unresolved. We identified an uncharacterized Arabidopsis thaliana prion-like protein we named FLOE1, which phase separates upon hydration and allows the embryo to sense water stress. We demonstrate that the biophysical states of FLOE1 condensates modulate its biological function in vivo in suppressing seed germination under unfavorable environments. We also find intragenic, intraspecific, and interspecific natural variations in phase separation propensity of FLOE1 homologs. These findings demonstrate a physiological role of phase separation in a multicellular organism and have direct implications for plant ecology and agriculture, especially the design of drought resistant crops, in the face of climate change.",
