    "abstract": "Visualizing actin filaments in fixed cells is of great interest for a variety of topics in cell biology such as cell division, cell movement, and cell signaling. We investigated the possibility of replacing phalloidin, the standard reagent for super-resolution imaging of F-actin in fixed cells, with the actin binding peptide  lifeact. We compared the labels for use in single molecule based super-resolution microscopy, where AlexaFluor 647 labeled phalloidin was used in a (d)STORM modality and Atto 655 labeled lifeact was used in a single molecule imaging, reversible binding modality. We found that imaging with lifeact had a comparable resolution in reconstructed images and provided several advantages over phalloidin including lower costs, the ability to image multiple regions of interest on a coverslip without degradation, simplified sequential super-resolution imaging, and more continuous labeling of thin filaments.",

    "abstract": "Troxerutin (TXR), is a phytochemical reported to possess anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective effects. In this study, we aimed to exploit anti-arthritic properties of TXR using an adjuvant induced arthritic (AIA) rat model. AIA induced rats showed highest arthritis score at disease onset and by oral administration of TXR (50, 100, 200 mg/kg body weight), reduced to basal level in a dose dependent manner. Isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitative (iTRAQ) proteomics tool was employed to identify deregulated joint homogenate proteins in AIA and TXR treated rats to decipher probable mechanism of the TXR action in arthritis. iTRAQ analysis identified a set of 434 joint homogenate proteins with 65 deregulated proteins (log2 case/control [&ge;]1.5) in AIA. Expressions of a set of important proteins (AAT, T-kininogen, vimentin, desmin, and nucleophosmin) that could classify AIA from healthy were validated using Western blot analysis. Western blot data corroborated proteomics findings. In silico protein-protein interaction study of joint homogenate proteome revealed that complement component 9, the major building blocks of the membrane attack complex (MAC) responsible for sterile inflammation, gets perturbed in AIA. Our dosimetry study suggests that a TXR dose of 200 mg/kg body weight for 15 days is sufficient to bring the arthritis score to basal levels in AIA rats. We have shown the importance of TXR as an anti-arthritis agent in AIA model and after additional investigation its arthritis ameliorating properties could be exploited for clinical usability.",

    "abstract": "Human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 1 or hFGF1 is a member of the FGF family that is involved in various vital processes such as cell proliferation, cell differentiation, angiogenesis and wound healing. hFGF1, which is associated with low stability in vivo, is known to be stabilized by binding heparin sulfate, a glycosaminoglycan that aids the protein in the activation of its cell surface receptor. The poor thermal and proteolytic stability of hFGF1 and the stabilizing role of heparin have long been observed experimentally; however, the mechanistic details of these phenomena are not well understood. Here, we have used a combination of microsecond-level equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and state-of-the-art enhanced sampling MD simulations to quantitatively characterize the structural dynamics of monomeric hFGF1 in the presence and absence of heparin hexasaccharide. We have observed a conformational change in the heparin-binding pocket of hFGF1 that occurs only in the absence of heparin. Several intramolecular hydrogen bonds were also identified within the heparin-binding pocket, that form only when hFGF1 interacts with heparin. The loss of both intermolecular and intramolecular electrostatic interactions in the absence of heparin plausibly leads to the observed conformational change. This conformational transition results in increased flexibility of the heparin-binding pocket and provides an explanation for the susceptibility of apo hFGF1 to proteolytic degradation and thermal instability. The hFGF1-heparin interaction has also been quantified using absolute binding free energy calculations. Binding affinity (Kd) estimates determined computationally using our novel MD approach are in good quantitative agreement with experimental Kd values from isothermal titration calorimetry experiments. The successful application of a combination of microsecond-level MD and accurate free energy calculations to explain the heparin-mediated stabilization of hFGF1 at a quantitative level, represents a promising approach for studying complex biomolecular interactions between proteins and their binding partners at a detailed molecular level using rigorous physics-based simulation techniques.",

    "abstract": "Chlorophyll (Chl) biosynthesis, crucial to life on Earth, is tightly regulated because its precursors are phototoxic1. In flowering plants, the enzyme Light-dependent Protochlorophyllide OxidoReductase (LPOR) captures photons to catalyze the penultimate reaction: the reduction of a double-bond within protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) to generate chlorophyllide (Chlide)2,3. In darkness, LPOR oligomerizes to facilitate photon energy transfer and catalysis4,5. However, the complete 3D structure of LPOR, the higher-order architecture of LPOR oligomers, and the implications of these self-assembled states for catalysis, including how LPOR positions Pchlide and the cofactor NADPH, remain unknown. Here we report the atomic structure of LPOR assemblies by electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM). LPOR polymerizes with its substrates into helical filaments around constricted lipid bilayer tubes. Portions of LPOR and Pchlide insert into the outer membrane leaflet, targeting the product, Chlide, to the membrane for the final reaction site of chlorophyll biosynthesis. In addition to its crucial photocatalytic role, we show that in darkness LPOR filaments directly shape membranes into high-curvature tubules with the spectral properties of the prolammelar body, whose light-triggered disassembly provides lipids for thylakoid assembly. Our structure of the catalytic site, moreover, challenges previously proposed reaction mechanisms6. Together, our results reveal a new and unexpected synergy between photosynthetic membrane biogenesis and chlorophyll synthesis in plants orchestrated by LPOR.",

    "abstract": "Systems biology approaches often use inferred networks of gene expression and metabolite data to identify regulatory factors and pathways connected with phenotypic variance. Generally, study-specific multi-layer \"Omics\" datasets are used to contextualize generic molecular networks. In this regard separating upstream causal mechanisms, downstream biomarkers, and incidental correlations remains a significant challenge, yet it is essential for designing mechanistic experiments. To address this, we designed a study following a population of 2157 individuals from 89 isogenic BXD mouse strains across their lifespan to identify molecular interactions among genotype, environment, age (GxExA) and metabolic fitness. Each strain was separated into two cohorts, one fed low fat (6% cal/fat) and the other high fat (60% cal/fat) diets. Tissues were collected for 662 individuals (309 cohorts) diverging across age (7, 12, 18, and 24 months), diet, sex, and strain. Transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome data were generated for liver. Of these we identified linear relations among these molecular data with lifespan for the same genomes of mice (Roy et al. 2020), and we defined [~]1100 novel protein-coding genes associated with longevity. We knocked down the ortholog of Ctsd in C. elegans. The treatment reduced longevity both in wildtype and in mutant long-lived strains, thus validating the prediction. Next, to assess the molecular impact of GxExA on gene expression, the multi-omics data was parsed into metabolic networks where connectivity varied due to the independent variables. Differences in edge strengths connecting nodes in these molecular networks according to each variable enabled causal inference by using stability selection, with roughly 21% of novel gene-pathway connections being causally affected by diet and/or age. For instance, Chchd2 is activated by aging and drives changes in the proteasome, oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial translation transcriptional networks. Together, we have developed a large multi-omics resource for studying aging in the liver, and a resource for turning standard associations into causal networks.",

However, little is known about the effect of traumatic brain injury on visual system function. Here we applied a mild focal contusion injury to primary visual cortex (V1) in adult mice. We found that, although V1 was largely intact in brain-injured mice, there was a reduction in the number of inhibitory interneurons that extended into deep cortical layers. In general, we found a preferential reduction of interneurons located in superficial layers, near the impact site, while interneurons positioned in deeper layers were better preserved. Three months after injury, V1 neurons showed dramatically reduced responses to visual stimuli and weaker orientation selectivity and tuning, consistent with the loss of cortical inhibition. Our results demonstrate that V1 neurons no longer robustly and stably encode visual input following a mild traumatic injury.\n\nHighlightsO_LIInhibitory neurons are lost throughout brain injured visual cortex\nC_LIO_LIVisually-evoked potentials are severely degraded after injury\nC_LIO_LIInjured V1 neurons show weaker selectivity and tuning consistent with reduced interneurons\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The presentation of Loud Acoustic Stimuli (LAS) during preparation can trigger motor actions at very short latencies in a phenomenon called the StartReact effect. It was initially proposed that a special, separate sub-cortical mechanism which by-passes slower cortical processes could be involved. We sought to examine the evidence for a separate mechanism against the alternative that responses to LAS can be explained by a combination of stimulus intensity effects and preparatory-states - as proposed by activation models of motor control.\n\nTo investigate whether cortically mediated preparatory processes are involved in shaping reactions to LAS, we used an auditory reaction task where we manipulated preparation-level within each trial. We contrasted responses to non-intense tones and LAS and examined whether cortical activation, sub-cortical excitability (measured by pre-stimulus EEG and eye-blink startle reflexes, respectively) and the motor response were influenced by preparation-level.\n\nAs predicted by the activation model, increases in preparation-level were marked by gradual reductions in RT coupled with increases in cortical activation and sub-cortical excitability - at both condition- and trial-levels. Changes in cortical activation influenced motor and auditory but not visual areas - highlighting the wide-spread yet selective nature of preparation. RTs were shorter to LAS than tones, but the overall pattern of preparation-level effects were the same for both stimuli. These results demonstrate that LAS responses are indeed shaped by cortically mediated preparatory processes. The concurrent changes observed in brain and behaviour with increasing preparation reinforces the notion that preparation is marked by evolving brain states which shape the motor response.\n\nKey PointsO_LIReactions to Loud Acoustic Stimuli can be explained by stimulus intensity and preparation state\nC_LIO_LIWe manipulated movement preparation by altering the temporal position of the imperative stimulus\nC_LIO_LIPreparation was marked by reductions in RT, and increased cortical and sub-cortical excitability\nC_LIO_LIPreparation had the same effect on reactions to Loud Acoustic Stimuli and non-intense tones\nC_LIO_LIThe results highlight the widespread, evolving, and strategic nature of movement preparation\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The neuropeptides CGRP and PACAP have emerged as mediators of migraine, yet the potential overlap of their mechanisms remains unknown. Infusion of PACAP, like CGRP, can cause migraine in people, and both peptides share similar vasodilatory and nociceptive functions. In this study, we have used light aversion in mice as a surrogate for migraine-like photophobia to compare CGRP and PACAP and ask whether CGRP or PACAP actions were dependent on each other. Similar to CGRP, PACAP induced light aversion in outbred CD-1 mice. The light aversion was accompanied by increased resting in the dark, but not anxiety in a light-independent open field assay. Unexpectedly, about a third of the CD-1 mice did not respond to PACAP, which was not seen with CGRP. The responder and nonresponder phenotypes were stable, inheritable, and not sex-linked, although there was generally a trend for greater responses among male mice. RNA-seq analysis of trigeminal ganglia yielded hieriechial clustering of responder and nonresponder mice and revealed a number of candidate genes, including greater expression of pituitary hormones and receptors in a subset of responder mice. Importantly, an anti-PACAP monoclonal antibody could block PACAP-induced light aversion but not CGRP-induced light aversion. Conversely, an anti-CGRP antibody could not block PACAP-induced light aversion. Thus, we propose that CGRP and PACAP act by independent convergent pathways that cause a migraine-like symptom in mice.\n\nSignificanceThe relationship between the neuropeptides CGRP and PACAP in migraine is relevant given that both peptides can induce migraine in people, yet to date only drugs that target CGRP are available. Using an outbred strain of mice, we were able to show that most, but not all, mice respond to PACAP in a preclinical photophobia assay. Our finding that CGRP and PACAP monoclonal antibodies do not cross-inhibit the other peptide indicates that CGRP and PACAP actions are independent and suggests that PACAP-targeted drugs may be effective in patients who do not respond to CGRP-based therapeutics.",

Only [~]50 human genetic disorders exhibit revertant mosaicism, implicating a distinctive role played by mutant proteins in somatic correction of a pathogenic germline mutation2. However, the process by which mutant proteins induce somatic genetic reversion in these diseases remains unknown. Here we show that heterozygous pathogenic CARD14 mutations causing autoinflammatory skin diseases, including psoriasis and pityriasis rubra pilaris, are repaired mainly via homologous recombination. Rather than altering the DNA damage response to exogenous stimuli such as X-irradiation or etoposide treatment, mutant CARD14 increased DNA double-strand breaks under conditions of replication stress. Furthermore, mutant CARD14 suppressed new origin firings without promoting crossover events in the replication stress state. Together, these results suggest that mutant CARD14 alters the replication stress response and preferentially drives break-induced replication (BIR), which is generally suppressed in eukaryotes3. Our results highlight the involvement of BIR in reversion events, thus revealing a previously undescribed role of BIR that could potentially be exploited to develop therapeutics for currently intractable genetic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance is a growing health concern. Efforts to control resistance would benefit from an improved ability to forecast when and how it will evolve. Epistatic interactions between mutations can promote divergent evolutionary trajectories, which complicates our ability to predict evolution. We recently showed that differences between genetic backgrounds can lead to idiosyncratic responses in the evolvability of phenotypic resistance, even among closely related Escherichia coli strains. In this study, we examined whether a strains genetic background also influences the genotypic evolution of resistance. Do lineages founded by different genotypes take parallel or divergent mutational paths to achieve their evolved resistance states? We addressed this question by sequencing the complete genomes of antibiotic-resistant clones that evolved from several different genetic starting points during our earlier experiments. We first validated our statistical approach by quantifying the specificity of genomic evolution with respect to antibiotic treatment. As expected, mutations in particular genes were strongly associated with each drug. Then, we determined that replicate lines evolved from the same founding genotypes had more parallel mutations at the gene level than lines evolved from different founding genotypes, although these effects were more subtle than those showing antibiotic specificity. Taken together with our previous work, we conclude that historical contingency can alter both genotypic and phenotypic pathways to antibiotic resistance.\n\nSignificanceA fundamental question in evolution is the repeatability of adaptation. Will independently evolving populations respond similarly when facing the same environmental challenge? This question also has important public-health implications related to the growing problem of antibiotic resistance. For example, efforts to control resistance might benefit from accurately predicting mutational paths to resistance. However, this goal is complicated when a lineages prior history alters its subsequent evolution. We recently found that differences between genetic backgrounds can lead to unpredictable responses in phenotypic resistance. Here, we report that genetic background can similarly alter genotypic paths to resistance. This historical contingency underscores the importance of accounting for stochasticity, in the past as well as at present, when designing evolutionarily informed treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "The sleeping chironomid Polypedilum vanderplanki is capable of anhydrobiosis, a striking example of adaptation to extreme desiccation. Tolerance to complete desiccation in this species is associated with the emergence of multiple paralogs of protective genes. One of the gene families highly expressed under anhydrobiosis and involved in this process are protein-L-isoaspartate (D-aspartate) O-methyltransferases (PIMTs). Recently, a closely related anhydrobiotic midge from Malawi, P. pembai, showing the ability to tolerate complete desiccation similar to that of P. vanderplanki, but experiences more frequent desiccation-rehydration cycles due to differences in ecology, was discovered. Here, we sequenced and assembled the genome of P. pembai and performed a population genomics analysis of several populations of P. vanderplanki and a population of P. pembai. We observe positive selection and radical changes in the genetic architecture of the PIMT locus between the two species, including multiple duplication events in the P. pembai lineage. In particular, PIMT-4, the most highly expressed of these PIMTs, is present in six copies in the P. pembai; these copies differ in expression profiles, suggesting possible sub- or neofunctionalization. The nucleotide diversity ({pi}) of the genomic region carrying these new genes is decreased in P. pembai, but not in the orthologous region carrying the ancestral gene in P. vanderplanki, providing evidence for a selective sweep associated with post-duplication adaptation in the former. Overall, our results suggest an extensive recent and likely ongoing, adaptation of the mechanisms of anhydrobiosis.",

    "abstract": "Sex chromosomes form once recombination is halted between the X and Y chromosomes. This loss of recombination quickly depletes Y chromosomes of functional content and genetic variation, which is thought to severely limit their potential to generate adaptive diversity. We examined Y diversity in Poecilia parae, where males occur as one of five discrete morphs, all of which shoal together in natural populations where morph frequency has been stable for over 50 years. Each morph utilizes different complex reproductive strategies, and differ dramatically from each other in color, body size, and mating behavior. Remarkably, morph phenotype is passed perfectly from father to son, indicating there are five Y haplotypes segregating in the species, each of which encodes the complex male morph characteristics. Using linked-read sequencing on multiple P. parae females and males of all five morphs from natural populations, we found that the genetic architecture of the male morphs evolved on the Y chromosome long after recombination suppression had occurred with the X. Comparing Y chromosomes between each of the morphs revealed that although the Ys of the three minor morphs that differ predominantly in color are highly similar, there are substantial amounts of unique genetic material and divergence between the Ys of the three major morphs that differ in reproductive strategy, body size and mating behavior. Taken together, our results reveal the extraordinary ability of evolution to overcome the constraints of recombination loss to generate extreme diversity resulting in five discrete Y chromosomes that control complex reproductive strategies.\n\nSignificance StatementThe loss of recombination on the Y chromosome is thought to limit the adaptive potential of this unique genomic region. Despite this, we describe an extraordinary case of Y chromosome adaptation in Poecilia parae. This species contains five co-occurring male morphs, all of which are Y-linked, and which differ in reproductive strategy, body size, coloration, and mating behavior. The five Y-linked male morphs of P. parae evolved after recombination was halted on the Y, resulting in five unique Y chromosomes within one species. Our results reveal the surprising magnitude to which non-recombining regions can generate adaptive diversity and have important implications for the evolution of sex chromosomes and the genetic control of sex-linked diversity.",

    "abstract": "Innate behaviours, though robust and hard wired, rely on modulation of neuronal circuits, for eliciting an appropriate response according to internal states and external cues. Drosophila flight is one such innate behaviour that is modulated by intracellular calcium release through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs). Cellular mechanism(s) by which IP3Rs modulate neuronal function for specific behaviours remain speculative, in vertebrates and invertebrates. To address this, we generated an inducible dominant negative form of the IP3R (IP3RDN). Flies with neuronal expression of IP3RDN exhibit flight deficits. Spatiotemporal expression of IP3RDN helped identify key flight-modulating dopaminergic neurons with axonal projections in the mushroom body. Attenuation of IP3R function in these presynaptic dopaminergic neurons resulted in flies with shortened flight bouts and a disinterest in seeking food, accompanied by reduced excitability and dopamine release upon cholinergic stimulation. Our findings suggest that the same neural circuit modulates the drive for food search and for undertaking longer flight bouts.",

Current understanding of endosomal escape mechanisms remains limited due to significant number of conflicting reports, which are compounded by low sensitivity and indirect assays. To resolve this, we developed a highly sensitive Split Luciferase Endosomal Escape Quantification (SLEEQ) assay to probe mechanisms of cytosolic delivery. We applied SLEEQ to evaluate the endosomal escape of a range of widely studied putative endosomal escape peptides (EEPs). We demonstrated that positively-charged EEPs enhanced cytosolic delivery as a result of increased non-specific cell membrane association, rather than increased endosomal escape efficiency. These findings transform our current understanding of how EEPs increase cytosolic delivery. SLEEQ is a powerful tool that addresses fundamental questions in intracellular drug delivery and will significantly improve the way materials are engineered to increase therapeutic delivery to the cytosol.",

This version improves the functionality of the software, including an easy way to determine the potential biological features affected by the candidates found. The quadruplex definitions of the algorithm were optimized for 2019-nCoV. Using a lax quadruplex definition ruleset, which accepts amongst other parameters two residue G- and C-tracks, hundreds of potential quadruplex candidates were discovered. These sequences were evaluated by their in vitro formation probability, their position in the viral RNA, their uniqueness and their conservation rates (calculated in over three thousand different COVID-19 clinical cases and sequenced at different times and locations during the ongoing pandemic). These results were compared sequentially to other Coronaviridae members, other Group IV (+)ssRNA viruses and the entire realm. Sequences found in common with other species were further analyzed and characterized. Sequences with high scores unique to the 2019-nCoV were studied to investigate the variations amongst similar species. Quadruplex formation of the best candidates was then confirmed experimentally. Using NMR and CD spectroscopy, we found several highly stable RNA quadruplexes that may be suitable theranostic targets against the 2019-nCoV.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=151 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/257493v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (50K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ab4843org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@152ebeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@afd7aforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@793707_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The behavioral strategies that mammals use to learn multi-step routes in natural settings are unknown. Here we show that mice spontaneously adopt a subgoal memory strategy. We first investigated how mice navigate to shelter in response to threats when the direct path is blocked. Initially, they fled toward the shelter and negotiated obstacles using sensory cues. Within twenty minutes, they adopted a subgoal strategy, initiating escapes by running directly to the obstacles edge. Mice continued to target this subgoal location after the obstacle was removed, indicating use of spatial memory. However, standard models of spatial learning - egocentric-movement repetition and internal-map building - did not explain how subgoal memories formed. Instead, mice used a hybrid approach: memorizing salient locations encountered during spontaneous  practice runs. This strategy was also used during geometrically identical reward-seeking behavior. These results suggest that subgoal memorization is a fundamental strategy by which rodents learn efficient multi-step routes in new environments.",

We simulated the viral infection by spiking in recombinant NP into 384-well plates with live Vero-E6 cells and were able to detect the NP with high sensitivity and a large dynamic range. Anti-viral agents that inhibit either viral cell entry or replication will decrease the AlphaLISA NP signal. Thus, this assay can be used for high-throughput screening of small molecules and biologics in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Bidirectional communication between cells and their surrounding environment is critical in both normal and pathological settings. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), which facilitate the horizontal transfer of molecules between cells, are recognized as an important constituent of cell-cell communication. In cancer, alterations in EV secretion contribute to the growth and metastasis of tumor cells. However, the mechanisms underlying these changes remain largely unknown. Here, we show that centrosome amplification is associated with and sufficient to promote small extracellular vesicle (SEV) secretion in pancreatic cancer cells. This is a direct result due of lysosomal dysfunction, caused by increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) downstream of extra centrosomes. Defects in lysosome function promotes multivesicular body fusion with the plasma membrane, thereby enhancing SEV secretion. Furthermore, we find that SEVs secreted in response to amplified centrosomes are functionally distinct and activate pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs). These activated PSCs promote the invasion of pancreatic cancer cells in heterotypic 3-D cultures. We propose that SEVs secreted by cancer cells with amplified centrosomes influence the bidirectional communication between the tumor cells and the surrounding stroma to promote malignancy.",

Several lines of evidence have suggested prolactin, a pituitary hormone released around the time of ejaculation in humans and other animals, to be a decisive player in the establishment of the refractory period. However, data supporting this hypothesis is controversial. We took advantage of two different strains of house mouse, a wild derived and a classical laboratory strain, that differ substantially in their sexual behavior, to investigate prolactins involvement in sexual motivation and the refractory period. First, we show that there is prolactin release during sexual behavior in male mice. Second, using a pharmacological approach, we show that acute manipulations of prolactin levels, either mimicking the natural release during sexual behavior or inhibiting its occurrence, do not affect sexual motivation or shorten the refractory period, respectively. Therefore, we show compelling evidence refuting the idea that prolactin released during copulation is involved in the establishment of the refractory period, a long-standing hypothesis in the field of behavioral endocrinology.",

    "abstract": "Tumor cell behaviors associated with aggressive tumor growth such as proliferation, therapeutic resistance, and stemness are regulated in part by soluble factors derived from the tumor microenvironment. Tumor-associated astrocytes represent a major component of the glioma tumor microenvironment, and astrocytes have an active role in maintenance of normal neural stem cells in the stem cell niche, in part via secretion of soluble Delta-like Non-Canonical Notch Ligand 1 (DLK1). We found that astrocytes, when exposed to stresses of the tumor microenvironment such as hypoxia or ionizing radiation (IR), increased secretion of soluble DLK1. Tumor-associated astrocytes in a glioma mouse model expressed DLK1 in perinecrotic (hypoxic) and perivascular tumor areas. Glioma cells exposed to recombinant DLK1 displayed increased proliferation, enhanced sphere and colony formation abilities, and increased levels of stem cell marker genes. Mechanistically, DLK1-mediated effects on glioma cells involved increased and prolonged stabilization of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 2alpha (HIF-2alpha), and inhibition of HIF-2alpha activity abolished effects of DLK1 in hypoxia. Forced expression of soluble DLK1 resulted in more aggressive tumor growth and shortened survival in a genetically engineered mouse model of glioma. Together, our data support DLK1 as a soluble mediator of glioma aggressiveness derived from the tumor microenvironment.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=176 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/258608v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (44K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18902b8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11b21corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c44f60org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1376300_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIAstrocytes secrete DLK1 after exposure to hypoxia or irradiation\nC_LIO_LISoluble DLK1 promotes stemness in glioma, in part by increasing HIF-2alpha stabilization.\nC_LIO_LIHigh levels of soluble DLK1 are associated with tumor aggressiveness and lethality.\nC_LI",

This approach enabled us to apply quasi-potentials, the negative logarithm of the probabilities, to calibrate the elevation of the landscapes with young cells as a reference state. Our approach detected opposite landscape changes based on protein abundances from transcript levels, especially for intra-essential gene interactions. We showed that essential proteins play different roles from hub proteins on the age-dependent landscapes. We verified that hub proteins tend to avoid other hub proteins, but essential proteins are attractive to other essential proteins. Overall, we showed that the probability landscape is promising for inferring network profile change during aging and that the essential hub proteins may play an important role in the uncoupling between protein and transcript levels during replicative aging.",

Previous studies have shown that early exposure to a simple augmented acoustic environment (AAE) can limit the effects of progressive SNHL on hearing sensitivity. However, SNHL is also accompanied by \"hidden hearing loss\" that is not assessed on standard audiological exams, such as reduced temporal processing acuity. To assess whether sound therapy may improve these hidden deficits, a mouse model of congenital SNHL was exposed to simple or temporally complex AAE. Peripheral function and sound sensitivity in auditory midbrain neurons improved following exposure to both types of AAE. However, only exposure to a novel, temporally complex AAE significantly improved a measure of temporal processing acuity, neural gap-in-noise detection in the auditory midbrain. These experiments suggest that targeted sound therapy may improve hearing outcomes for children suffering from congenital SNHL.",

    "abstract": "Metabolism of {beta}-amyloid is critical for healthy brain. Decreased clearance of {beta}-amyloid is associated with ensued accumulation of amyloid peptide, culminating in formation of senile plaques, a neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimers disease(AD). Apolipoprotein E (APOE), a lipoprotein for phospholipid and cholesterol metabolism, is predominantly synthesized by glia in the central nervous system, controlling A{beta} aggregation and metabolism. By use of stereotactic injection and a Morris water maze, we found that delivery of Dicer1-expressing adenovirus into the hippocampus of an animal model of AD mice APPswe/PSEN1deltaE9 significantly improved spatial memory. The effect was associated with reduced amyloid peptides in the hippocampus which were analyzed with immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. With western blot, quantitative real-time PCR, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and northern blot, Dicer1 overexpression increased apolipoprotein E (APOE) and concomitantly decreased B2 RNA in the hippocampus of the AD mice and in astrocyte cultures whereas transfection of B2 Mm2 RNA decreased APOE mRNA and protein levels in astrocyte cultures. Further, human or mouse APOE mRNA was found containing Alu RNA or its equivalent, B2 Mm2 RNA, locating downstream of its 3-untranslated region (UTR), respectively. The 3-UTR or 3-UTR in conjunction with the downstream Alu/B2 RNA were cloned into a luciferase reporter; with dual-luciferase assay, we found that simultaneous transfection of Dicer1 siRNA or Alu/B2 RNA decreased the corresponding luciferase activities which suggest that Alu RNA mediated APOE mRNA degradation. Altogether, Dicer1 expression mediated amyloid peptide clearance by increasing APOE via blocking B2 RNA-mediated APOE mRNA degradation.",

To date, most studies have exclusively targeted neuronal populations and not considered neuron-glia crosstalk as a crucially important element for the integrity of stress-related brain function. Here, we have investigated the impact of ELS on a glial subpopulation with unique properties in brain homeostasis, the NG2+ cells. ELS shifted the NG2+ transcriptome towards more mature stages, and these transcriptional effects were dependent on stress-induced glucocorticoids. The functional relevance of one candidate gene, Scn7a, could be confirmed by an increase in the density of voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channel activated currents in hippocampal NG2+ cells. Scn7a remained upregulated until adulthood in ELS animals, and these same animals displayed impaired cognitive performance. Considering that Nav channels are important for NG2+ cell-to-neuron communication, our findings suggest novel insights into the pathophysiology of stress-related mental disorders.",

Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a leading cause of bacterial meningitis and many survivors develop neurological sequelae after the acute infection has resolved, possibly due to neuronal damage. Here, we studied mechanisms for pneumococcal interactions with neurons. Using human primary neurons and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we showed that pneumococci interact with the cytoskeleton protein {beta}-actin through the pilus-1 adhesin RrgA and the cytotoxin pneumolysin (Ply), thereby promoting adhesion and uptake into neurons and neuronal death. Using our bacteremia-derived meningitis mouse model, we observed that RrgA- and Ply-expressing pneumococci co-localize with neuronal {beta}-actin. We found that pneumococcal-infected neurons show increased intracellular Ca2+ levels depending on RrgA and mainly Ply which likely cause actin cytoskeleton disassembly leading to neuronal damage. Finally, neuronal death caused by pneumococcal infection could be inhibited using antibody against {beta}-actin.",

Here, we reveal that cavefish exhibited social-like interactions in familiar environments but suppressed these interactions in stress-associated unfamiliar environments. Furthermore, the level of suppression in sociality was positively correlated with that of stereotypic repetitive behaviour, as seen in mammals. Treatment with a human antipsychotic drug targeting the dopaminergic system induced social-like interactions in cavefish, even in unfamiliar environments, while reducing repetitive behaviour. Overall, these results suggest that the antagonistic relationship between repetitive and social-like behaviours is deeply shared from teleosts through mammals.",

    "abstract": "Changes in regulatory networks generate materials for evolution to create phenotypic diversity. For transcription networks, multiple studies have shown that alterations in binding sites of cis-regulatory elements correlate well with the gain or loss of specific features of the body plan. Less is known about alterations in the amino acid sequences of the transcription factors (TFs) that bind these elements. Here we study the evolution of Bicoid (Bcd), a homeodomain (HD) protein that is critical for anterior embryo patterning in Drosophila. The ancestor of Bcd (AncBcd) emerged after a duplication of a Zerknullt (Zen)-like ancestral protein (AncZB) in a suborder of flies. AncBcd diverged from AncZB, gaining novel transcriptional and translational activities. We focus on the evolution of the HD of AncBcd, which binds DNA and RNA, and is comprised of four subdomains: an N-terminal arm (NT) and three helices; H1, H2, and Recognition Helix (RH). Using chimeras of subdomains and gene rescue assays in Drosophila, we show that robust patterning activity of the Bcd HD (high frequency rescue to adulthood) is achieved only when amino acid substitutions in three separate subdomains (NT, H1, and RH) are combined. Other combinations of subdomains also yield full rescue, but with lower penetrance, suggesting alternative suboptimal activities. Our results suggest a multi-step pathway for the evolution of the Bcd HD that involved intermediate HD sequences with suboptimal activities, which constrained and enabled further evolutionary changes. They also demonstrate critical epistatic forces that contribute to the robust function of a DNA-binding domain.",

    "abstract": "The species of family Lactobacillaceae are found in highly diverse environments and play an important role in fermented foods and probiotic products. Many of these species have been individually reported to harbor plasmids that encode important genes. In this study, we performed comparative genomic analysis of the publically available data of 512 plasmids from 282 strains represented by 51 species of this family and correlated the genomic features of plasmids with the ecological niches in which these species are found. Two-third of the species had at least one plasmid-harboring strain. Plasmid abundance and GC content were significantly lower in the vertebrate-adapted species as compared to the nomadic and free-living species. Hierarchical clustering (HCL) highlighted the distinct nature of plasmids from the nomadic and free-living species than those from the vertebrate-adapted species. EggNOG assisted functional annotation revealed that genes associated with transposition, conjugation, DNA repair and recombination, exopolysaccharide production, metal ion transport, toxin-antitoxin system, and stress tolerance were significantly enriched on the plasmids of the nomadic and in some cases nomadic and free-living species. On the other hand, genes related to anaerobic metabolism, ABC transporters, and major facilitator superfamily were found to be overrepresented on the plasmids of the vertebrate-adapted species. These genomic signatures are correlated to the comparatively nutrient-depleted, stressful and dynamic environments of nomadic and free-living species and nutrient-rich and anaerobic environments of the vertebrate-adapted species. Thus, these results indicate the contribution of the plasmids in the adaptation of lactobacilli to the respective habitats. This study also underlines the potential application of these plasmids in improving the technological and probiotic properties of lactic acid bacteria.\n\nImpact statementThe bacteria of the family Lactobacillaceae are present in the wide range of habitats and play an important role in human health, fermented foods and chemical industries. A few studies have demonstrated the presence of plasmids in the individual strains of Lactobacillaceae species encoding various traits. Extensive data of genome sequences of the lactobacilli are becoming available; however, no comprehensive analysis of the plasmid-encoded genes and determining their biological relevance across lactobacilli has been undertaken at a larger scale. In this study, we explored the genomic content of 512 plasmids of Lactobacillaceae species and correlated it to the three types of these species according to their ecological niches - vertebrate-adapted, free-living and nomadic. Comparatively lower plasmid abundance and GC content in the vertebrate-adapted species could be correlated to the presence of these species in the nutrient-rich environment. The genomic content of the plasmids was consistent with the respective lifestyle adopted by lactobacilli suggesting that the plasmids might enhance the niche-specific fitness of the strains. The plethora of important genes present on the plasmids can also make them a highly useful tool in improving the probiotic, technological and food-related properties of lactobacilli.\n\nData summaryNucleotide sequences of plasmids of Lactobacillus strains for which complete genome sequences were available were retrieved from the NCBI genome [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome] and PATRIC 3.5.41 databases on 31st March 2019. The dataset includes 512 nucleotide sequences of plasmids of 282 strains belonging to genus Lactobacillus before its reclassification into several genera (1). Details of the plasmids have been given in Table S1.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the activity of large populations of neurons is difficult due to the combinatorial complexity of possible cell-cell interactions. To reduce the complexity, coarse-graining had been previously applied to experimental neural recordings, which showed over two decades of scaling in free energy, activity variance, eigenvalue spectra, and correlation time, hinting that the mouse hippocampus operates in a critical regime. We model the experiment by simulating conditionally independent binary neurons coupled to a small number of long-timescale stochastic fields and then replicating the coarse-graining procedure and analysis. This reproduces the experimentally-observed scalings, suggesting that they may arise from coupling the neural population activity to latent dynamic stimuli. Further, parameter sweeps for our model suggest that emergence of scaling requires most of the cells in a population to couple to the latent stimuli, predicting that even the celebrated place cells must also respond to non-place stimuli.",

    "abstract": "In the field of neuroscience, despite the fact that the proportion of peer-reviewed publications authored by women has increased in recent decades, the proportion of citations of women-led publications has not seen a commensurate increase: In five broad-scope journals, citations of papers first- and/or last-authored by women have been shown to be fewer than would be expected if gender was not a factor in citation decisions (Dworkin et al., 2020). Given the important implications that such underrepresentation may have on the careers of women researchers, it is important to determine whether this same trend is true in subdisciplines of the field, where interventions might be more effective. Here, we report the results of an extension of the analyses carried out by Dworkin et al. (2020) to citation patterns in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience (JoCN). The results indicate that the underrepresentation of women-led publications in reference sections is also characteristic of papers published in JoCN over the past decade. Furthermore, this pattern of citation imbalances is present for all gender classes of authors, implicating systemic factors. These results contribute to the growing body of evidence that intentional action is needed to address inequities in the way that we carry out and communicate our science.",

    "abstract": "Speech processing is built upon encoding by the auditory nerve and brainstem, yet we know very little about how these processes unfold in specific subcortical structures. These structures are deep and respond quickly, making them difficult to study during ongoing speech. Recent techniques begin to address this problem, but yield temporally broad responses with consequently ambiguous neural origins. Here we describe a method that pairs re-synthesized \"peaky\" speech with deconvolution analysis of EEG recordings. We show that in adults with normal hearing, the method quickly yields robust responses whose component waves reflect activity from distinct subcortical structures spanning auditory nerve to rostral brainstem. We further demonstrate the versatility of peaky speech by simultaneously measuring bilateral and ear-specific responses across different frequency bands, and discuss important practical considerations such as talker choice. The peaky speech method holds promise as a tool for investigating speech encoding and processing, and for clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is an established neuromodulation technique, using electromagnetic pulses that, depending on the precise parameters, are assumed to lead to lasting neural excitability changes. rTMS has widespread applications in both research and therapy, where it has been FDA approved and is considered a first-line treatment for depression, according to recent North American and European guidelines. However, these assumed excitability effects are often difficult to replicate, and highly unreliable on the single subject/patient level. Given the increasing application of rTMS, especially in clinical practice, the absence of a method to unequivocally determine effects of rTMS on human neuronal excitability is problematic. We have taken a first step in addressing this bottleneck, by administering excitatory and inhibitory rTMS protocols, iTBS and cTBS, to a human in vitro neuron model; differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. We use live calcium imaging to assess changes in neural activity following stimulation, through quantifying fluorescence response to chemical depolarization. We found that iTBS and cTBS have opposite effects on fluorescence response; with iTBS increasing and cTBS decreasing response to chemical depolarization. Our results are promising, as they provide a clear demonstration of rTMS after-effects in a living human neuron model. We here present an in-vitro live calcium imaging setup that can be further applied to more complex human neuron models, for developing and evaluating subject/patient-specific brain stimulation protocols.",

These IL-12/15/18-stimulated NK cells, also known as cytokine-induced memory-like (CIML) NK cells, have been revealed as a powerful tool in cancer immunotherapy due to their persistence in the host and their increased effector functions. Several studies have shown that NK cells modulate their metabolism in response to cytokine-stimulation and other stimuli, suggesting that there is a link between metabolism and cellular functions. In this paper, we have analyzed metabolic changes associated to IL-12/15/18-stimulation and the relevance of glycolytic pathway for NK cell effector functions. We have found that CIML NK cells are able to retain increased glycolytic machinery seven days after cytokine withdrawal. Furthermore, we found that glycolytic inhibition with 2-DG is stimuli-dependent and that differently affects to distinct effector functions.

    "abstract": "AimMagnetotactic bacteria are gram-negative, prokaryotic organisms which align themselves according to the Earths geomagnetic field. They contain organelles called magnetosomes which produce nano-magnetites by the mechanism of biomineralization. These nano-magnetites are arranged in the form of well-ordered chain called magnetosome chain, which are held together by intermolecular forces. The growth of these bacteria is stringent to specific oxygen gradient regions, where there is oxic-anoxic transition zone. In this paper, we report the cultivation and characterisation of magnetotactic bacteria that was accomplished under laboratory conditions and scanning electron microscope respectively.\n\nMethodologyBacterial soil samples were collected and cultivated under laboratory conditions using a precise and cost-effective media formulation using coffee bean extract and ferric chloride, which were to provide sufficient iron under the influence of external magnetic field. Experiments were conducted using media, deficient with ferric chloride and coffee bean solution, as control. Pour plate method was carried out for the growth of bacteria under the influence of external magnetic field provided on one-end of the petri-plate.\n\nResultWe observed the growth of the cultivated bacteria in the proximity of the magnetic field only in the presence of iron in media. This emphasises that the media formulated was appropriate for the growth of bacteria under laboratory conditions. Scanning electron microscope analysis confirmed the presence of magnetosome chains in magnetotactic bacteria.\n\nInterpretationIn this research, the bacteria were able to sustain in artificial oxygen-transition zones provided in the laboratory. The coffee bean solution contained quinic acid and succinic acid, which along with ferric chloride provided iron in the form of ferric quinate, and succinic acid which are the major sources of growth for the bacteria. Even though magnetosome research has shown promising advances, one of major limitations in its commercialization is its difficulty in cultivation under laboratory conditions.",

    "abstract": "Sulf2a belongs to the Sulf family of extracellular sulfatases which selectively remove 6-O-sulfate groups from heparan sulfates, a critical regulation level for their role in modulating the activity of signalling molecules. Data presented here define Sulf2a as a novel player in the control of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh)-mediated cell type specification during spinal cord development. We show that Sulf2a depletion in zebrafish results in overproduction of V3 interneurons at the expense of motor neurons and also impedes generation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), three cell types that depend on Shh for their generation. We provide evidence that Sulf2a, expressed in a spatially restricted progenitor domain, acts by maintaining the correct patterning and specification of ventral progenitors. More specifically, Sulf2a prevents Olig2 progenitors to activate high-threshold Shh response and, thereby, to adopt a V3 interneuron fate, thus ensuring proper production of motor neurons and OPCs. We propose a model in which Sulf2a reduces Shh signalling levels in responding cells by decreasing their sensitivity to the morphogen factor. More generally, our work, revealing that, in contrast to its paralog Sulf1, Sulf2a regulates neural fate specification in Shh target cells, provides direct evidence of non-redundant functions of Sulfs in the developing spinal cord.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe extracellular matrix (ECM) is a network of proteins and glycosaminoglycans that provides structural and biochemical cues to cells. In the kidney, the ECM is critical for nephrogenesis; however, the dynamics of ECM composition and how it relates to 3D structure during development is unknown.\n\nMethodsUsing embryonic day (E)14.5, E18.5, postnatal day (P)3, and adult kidneys, we fractionated proteins based on differential solubilities, performed liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry, and identified changes in ECM protein content (matrisome). Decellularized kidneys were stained for ECM proteins and imaged in 3D using confocal microscopy.\n\nResultsWe observed an increase in interstitial ECM that connect the stromal mesenchyme to the basement membrane (TNXB, COL6A1, COL6A2, COL6A3) between the embryo and adult, and a transient elevation of interstitial matrix proteins (COL5A2, COL12A1, COL26A1, ELN, EMID1, FBN1, LTBP4, THSD4) at perinatal timepoints. Basement membrane proteins critical for metanephric induction (FRAS1, FREM2) were highest in the embryo, whereas proteins necessary for glomerular basement membrane integrity (COL4A3, COL4A4, COL4A5, LAMB2) were more abundant in the adult. 3D visualization revealed a complex interstitial matrix that dramatically changed over development, including the perinatal formation of fibrillar structures that appear to support the medullary rays.\n\nConclusionBy correlating 3D ECM spatiotemporal organization with global protein abundance, we identified novel changes in the interstitial matrix during kidney development. This new information regarding the ECM in developing kidneys offers the potential to inform the design of regenerative scaffolds that can guide nephrogenesis in vitro.\n\nSignificance statementEnd-stage renal disease is increasing and there are a limited number of organs available for transplantation. Therefore, researchers have focused on understanding how cellular signaling influences kidney development to expand strategies to rebuild a kidney. However, the extracellular matrix (ECM), another critical component that biomechanically regulates nephrogenesis, has been largely neglected. This paper combines proteomics and 3D imaging of the murine kidney to resolve previously undescribed dynamics of the interstitial matrix in the cortex and corticomedullary junction during development. Combined with cell and growth factors, scaffolds modeled after the composition and organization of the developmental ECM have the potential to improve tissue engineering models of the kidney, like organoids.",

    "abstract": "To convey meaning, human language relies on hierarchically organized, long-range relationships spanning words, phrases, sentences, and discourse. The strength of the relationships between sequentially ordered elements of language (e.g., phonemes, characters, words) decays following a power law as a function of sequential distance. To understand the origins of these relationships, we examined long-range statistical structure in the speech of human children at multiple developmental time points, along with non-linguistic behaviors in humans and phylogenetically distant species. Here we show that adult-like power-law statistical dependencies precede the production of hierarchically-organized linguistic structures, and thus cannot be driven solely by these structures. Moreover, we show that similar long-range relationships occur in diverse non-linguistic behaviors across species. We propose that the hierarchical organization of human language evolved to exploit pre-existing long-range structure present in much larger classes of non-linguistic behavior, and that the cognitive capacity to model long-range hierarchical relationships preceded language evolution. We call this the Statistical Scaffolding Hypothesis for language evolution.\n\n1 Significance StatementHuman language is uniquely characterized by semantically meaningful hierarchical organization, conveying information over long timescales. At the same time, many non-linguistic human and animal behaviors are also often characterized by richly hierarchical organization. Here, we compare the long-timescale statistical dependencies present in language to those present in non-linguistic human and animal behaviors as well as language production throughout childhood. We find adult-like, long-timescale relationships early in language development, before syntax or complex semantics emerge, and we find similar relationships in non-linguistic behaviors like cooking and even housefly movement. These parallels demonstrate that long-range statistical dependencies are not unique to language and suggest a possible evolutionary substrate for the long-range hierarchical structure present in human language.",

A hallmark of healthy vocal fold oscillation is the symmetric motion of the left and right vocal fold. Clinically, videoendoscopy is applied to assess the symmetry of the oscillation and evaluated subjectively. High-speed videoendoscopy, an emerging method that allows quantification of the vocal fold oscillation, is more commonly employed in research due to the amount of data and the complex, semi-automatic analysis. In this study, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of methods that detect fully automatically the glottal midline. We use a biophysical model to simulate different vocal fold oscillations, extended the openly available BAGLS dataset using manual annotations, utilized both, simulations and annotated endoscopic images, to train deep neural networks at different stages of the analysis workflow, and compared these to established computer vision algorithms. We found that classical computer vision perform well on detecting the glottal midline in glottis segmentation data, but are outper-formed by deep neural networks on this task. We further suggest GlottisNet, a multi-task neural architecture featuring the simultaneous prediction of both, the opening between the vocal folds and the symmetry axis, leading to a huge step forward towards clinical applicability of quantitative, deep learning-assisted laryngeal endoscopy, by fully automating segmentation and midline detection.",

    "abstract": "The endometrium is a dynamic tissue that exhibits remarkable resilience to repeated episodes of differentiation, breakdown, regeneration and remodelling. Endometrial physiology relies on a complex interplay between the stromal and epithelial compartments with the former containing a mixture of fibroblasts, vascular and immune cells. There is evidence for rare populations of putative mesenchymal progenitor cells located in the perivascular niche of human endometrium, but the existence of an equivalent cell population in mouse is unclear.\n\nIn the current study we used the Pdgfrb-BAC-eGFP transgenic reporter mouse in combination with bulk and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to redefine the endometrial mesenchyme. Contrary to previous reports we show that CD146 is expressed in both PDGFR{beta}+ perivascular cells as well as CD31+ endothelial cells. Bulk RNAseq revealed cells in the perivascular niche which express high levels of Pdgfrb as well as genes previously identified in pericytes and/or vascular smooth muscle cells (Acta2, Myh11, Olfr78, Cspg4, Rgs4, Rgs5, Kcnj8, Abcc9). scRNAseq identified five subpopulations of cells including closely related pericytes/vascular smooth muscle cells and three subpopulations of fibroblasts. All three fibroblast populations were PDGFR+/CD34+ but were distinct in their expression of Spon2/Angptl7 (fibroblast 1), Smoc2/Rgs2 (fibroblast 2) and Clec3b/Col14a1/Mmp3 (fibroblast 3), with potential functions in regulation of immune responses, response to wounding and organisation of extracellular matrix respectively.\n\nIn conclusion, these data are the first to provide a single cell atlas of the mesenchymal cell landscape in mouse endometrium. By identifying novel markers for subpopulations of mesenchymal cells we can use mouse models investigate their contribution to endometrial function, compare with other tissues and apply these findings to further our understanding of human endometrium.\n\nHighlightsO_LIGFP expression in the mouse endometrium, under the control of the Pdgfrb promoter, is restricted to two cell populations based on the intensity of GFP with GFPbright cells close to the vasculature\nC_LIO_LISingle cell RNAseq identified five subpopulations of GFP+ mesenchymal cells: pericytes, vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMC) and three closely related but distinct populations of fibroblasts\nC_LIO_LIBioinformatics revealed that pericytes and vSMC share functions associated with the circulatory system, actin-filament process and cell adhesion, and an apparent role for pericytes in smooth muscle cell migration and response to interferons\nC_LIO_LIComparisons between the fibroblast subpopulations suggest distinct roles in regulation of immune response, response to wound healing and collagen organisation.\nC_LI\n\nGraphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been pandemic worldwide. The genetic dynamics of quasispecies afford RNA viruses a great fitness on cell tropism and host range. However, no quasispecies data of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported yet. To explore quasispecies haplotypes and its transmission characteristics, we carried out single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing of the full-length of SARS-CoV-2 spike gene within 14 RNA samples from 2 infection clusters, covering first-to third-generation infected-patients. We observed a special quasispecies structure of SARS-CoV-2 (modeled as  One-King): one dominant haplotype (mean abundance ~70.15%) followed by numerous minor haplotypes (mean abundance < 0.10%). We not only discovered a novel dominant haplotype of F1040 but also realized that minor quasispecies were also worthy of attention. Notably, some minor haplotypes (like F1040 and currently pandemic one G614) could potentially reveal adaptive and converse into the dominant one. However, minor haplotypes exhibited a high transmission bottleneck (~6% could be stably transmitted), and the new adaptive/dominant haplotypes were likely originated from genetic variations within a host rather than transmission. The evolutionary rate was estimated as 2.68-3.86 x 10-3 per site per year, which was larger than the estimation at consensus genome level. The  One-King model and conversion event expanded our understanding of the genetic dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, and explained the incomprehensible phenomenon at the consensus genome level, such as limited cumulative mutations and low evolutionary rate. Moreover, our findings suggested the epidemic strains may be multi-host origin and future traceability would face huge difficulties.",

    "abstract": "Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) are a key model system to study macrophage biology in vitro. Commonly used methods to differentiate macrophages from bone marrow are treatment with either recombinant M-CSF or the supernatant of L929 cells, which secrete M-CSF. However, little is known about the composition of L929 cell conditioned media (LCCM) and how it affects BMDM phenotype. Here, we used quantitative mass spectrometry to characterise the kinetics of protein secretion from L929 cells over a two-week period, identifying 2,193 proteins. While M-CSF is very abundant in LCCM, we identified several other immune-regulatory proteins such as macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), osteopontin and chemokines such as Ccl2 and Ccl7 at surprisingly high abundance levels. We therefore further characterised the proteomes of BMDMs after differentiation with M-CSF, M-CSF + MIF or LCCM, respectively. Interestingly, macrophages differentiated with LCCM induced a stronger anti-inflammatory M1 phenotype that those differentiated with M-CSF. This resource will be valuable to all researchers using LCCM for the differentiation of BMDMs.",

    "abstract": "Neutralizing antibodies (Abs) have been considered as promising therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of pathogens. After the outbreak of COVID-19, potent neutralizing Abs to SARS-CoV-2 were promptly developed, and a few of those neutralizing Abs are being tested in clinical studies. However, there were few methodologies detailly reported on how to rapidly and efficiently generate neutralizing Abs of interest. Here, we present a strategically optimized method for precisive screening of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which enabled us to identify SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) specific Abs within 4 days, followed by another 2 days for neutralization activity evaluation. By applying the screening system, we obtained 198 Abs against the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Excitingly, we found that approximately 50% (96/198) of them were candidate neutralizing Abs in a preliminary screening of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and 20 of these 96 neutralizing Abs were confirmed with high potency. Furthermore, 2 mAbs with the highest neutralizing potency were identified to block authentic SARS-CoV-2 with the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) at concentrations of 9.88 ng/ml and 11.13 ng/ml. In this report, we demonstrated that the optimized neutralizing Abs screening system is useful for the rapid and efficient discovery of potent neutralizing Abs against SARS-CoV-2.

    "abstract": "Environmental cues in an ecological niche are often temporal in nature. For instance, in temperate climates, temperature is higher in daytime compared to during night. In response to these temporal cues, bacteria have been known to exhibit anticipatory regulation, whereby they trigger response to a yet to appear cue, anticipating its actual arrival in the near future. Such an anticipatory response in known to enhance Darwinian fitness, and hence, is likely an important feature of regulatory networks in microorganisms. However, the conditions under which an anticipatory response evolves as an adaptive response are not known. In this work, we develop a quantitative model to study response of a population to two temporal environmental cues, and predict variables which are likely important for evolution of anticipatory regulatory response. We follow this with experimental evolution of E. coli in alternating environments of a pentose sugar, rhamnose, and an oxidative stress molecule, paraquat for more than 800 generations. We demonstrate that growth in this cyclical environment leads to evolution of anticipatory regulation, whereby, exposure to rhamnose leads to partial induction of the oxidative stress response regulon. As a result, pre-exposure to rhamnose leads to a greater fitness in paraquat environment. Overall, we show that in niches where environmental stimuli have a cyclical nature, anticipatory regulation can evolve as an adaptive strategy, in a time course of a few hundred generations. This contributes to our understanding of how environment shapes the topology of regulatory networks in an organism.",

The zoonotic virus most likely originated from bats, but definite intermediate hosts have not yet been identified. Raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) are kept for fur production, in particular in China, and were suspected as potential intermediate host for both SARS-CoV6 and SARS-CoV2. Here we demonstrate susceptibility of raccoon dogs for SARS-CoV-2 infection after intranasal inoculation and transmission to direct contact animals. Rapid, high level virus shedding, in combination with minor clinical signs and pathohistological changes, seroconversion and absence of viral adaptation highlight the role of raccoon dogs as a potential intermediate host. The results are highly relevant for control strategies and emphasize the risk that raccoon dogs may represent a potential SARS-CoV-2 reservoir. Our results support the establishment of adequate surveillance and risk mitigation strategies for kept and wild raccoon dogs.\n\nArticle Summary LineRaccoon dogs are susceptible to and efficiently transmit SARS-CoV2 and may serve as intermediate host",

The transcriptome of SCs is highly dynamic and timely regulated during postnatal development. We examined if such dynamics involves changes in chromatin organization by profiling the transcriptome and chromatin accessibility in SCs from early postnatal stages to adulthood in mice using RNA-seq and ATAC-seq. By integrating transcriptomic and epigenomic features, we show that SCs undergo massive chromatin remodeling during postnatal development that correlates with distinct gene expression profiles and transcription factors (TF) motif enrichment. We identify genomic regions with significantly different chromatin accessibility in adult SCs that are marked by histone modifications associated with enhancers and promoters. Some of the regions with increased accessibility correspond to transposable element subtypes enriched in multiple TFs motifs and close to differentially expressed genes. Our results underscore the dynamics of chromatin organization in developing germ cells and the involvement of the regulatory genome.",

However, it remains unclear how airway smooth muscle differentiation is spatiotemporally patterned and whether it originates from distinct mesenchymal progenitors. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing of embryonic mouse lungs, we show that the pulmonary mesenchyme contains a continuum of cell identities, but no distinct progenitors. Transcriptional variability correlates with sub-epithelial and sub-mesothelial mesenchymal compartments that are regulated by Wnt signaling. Live-imaging and tension-sensors reveal compartment-specific migratory behaviors and cortical forces, and show that sub-epithelial mesenchyme contributes to airway smooth muscle. Cytoskeletal and Wnt signaling pathways are activated early in reconstructed differentiation trajectories. Consistently, Wnt activation stimulates the earliest stages of smooth muscle differentiation and induces local accumulation of mesenchymal F-actin, which influences epithelial morphology. Our single-cell approach uncovers the principles of pulmonary mesenchymal patterning during branching morphogenesis and identifies a morphogenetically active mesenchymal layer that sculpts the airway epithelium.",

    "abstract": "ETV6 is an ETS family transcriptional repressor for which head-to-tail polymerization of its PNT domain facilitates cooperative binding to DNA by its ETS domain. Chromosomal translocations frequently fuse the ETV6 PNT domain to one of several protein tyrosine kinases. The resulting chimeric oncoproteins undergo ligand-independent self-association, autophosphorylation, and aberrant stimulation of downstream signaling pathways leading to a variety of cancers. Currently, no small molecules inhibitors of ETV6 PNT domain polymerization are known and no assays targeting PNT domain polymerization have been described. In this study, we developed complementary experimental and computational approaches for identifying such inhibitory compounds. One mammalian cellular approach utilized a mutant PNT domain heterodimer system covalently attached to split Gaussia luciferase fragments. In this protein fragment complementation assay, inhibition of PNT domain heterodimerization reduces luminescence. A yeast assay took advantage of activation of the reporter HIS3 gene upon heterodimerization of mutant PNT domains fused to DNA-binding and transactivation domains. In this two-hybrid screen, inhibition of PNT domain heterodimerization prevents cell growth in medium lacking histidine. The Bristol University Docking Engine (BUDE) was used to identify virtual ligands from the ZINC8 library predicted to bind the PNT domain polymerization interfaces. Over 75 hits from these three assays were tested by NMR spectroscopy for binding to the purified ETV6 PNT domain. Although none were found to bind, lessons learned from this study may facilitate future approaches for developing therapeutics that act against ETV6 oncoproteins by disrupting PNT domain polymerization.",

    "abstract": "Topic modeling is frequently employed for discovering structures (or patterns) in a corpus of documents. Its utility in text-mining and document retrieval tasks in various fields of scientific research is rather well known. An unsupervised machine learning approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) has particularly been utilized for identifying latent (or hidden) topics in document collections and for deciphering the words that define one or more topics using a generative statistical model. Here we describe how SARS-CoV-2 genomic mutation profiles can be structured into a  Bag of Words to enable identification of signatures (topics) and their probabilistic distribution across various genomes using LDA. Topic models were generated using ~47000 novel corona virus genomes (considered as documents), leading to identification of 16 amino acid mutation signatures and 18 nucleotide mutation signatures (equivalent to topics) in the corpus of chosen genomes through coherence optimization. The document assumption for genomes also helped in identification of contextual nucleotide mutation signatures in the form of conventional N-grams (e.g. bi-grams and tri-grams). We validated the signatures obtained using LDA driven method against the previously reported recurrent mutations and phylogenetic clades for genomes. Additionally, we report the geographical distribution of the identified mutation signatures in SARS-CoV-2 genomes on the global map. Use of the non-phylogenetic albeit classical approaches like topic modeling and other data centric pattern mining algorithms is therefore proposed for supplementing the efforts towards understanding the genomic diversity of the evolving SARS-CoV-2 genomes (and other pathogens/microbes).",

By determining whether the terminal phenotype induced by each kinase inhibitor matched that of the predicted target mutant in C. elegans, we identified 17 druggable nematode kinase targets.

In recent years, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as important components of cellular regulatory networks involved in most biological processes, including response to stress.

Comparison to HS in cauline leaves and other RNAseq experiments, indicated 74% of the 312 XLOCs are pollen-specific, and at least 42% are HS-responsive. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 96% of the genes evolved recently in Brassicaceae. We found that 50 genes are putative targets of microRNAs, and that 30% of the XLOCs contain small open reading frames (ORFs) with homology to protein sequences.

Control of diseases and the management of resistance would be greatly aided by rapid diagnostic methods. Quantitative allele specific PCR (ASqPCR) is an ideal technique for the analysis of fungicide resistance in the field as it can both detect and quantify the frequency of mutations associated with fungicide resistance. We have applied this technique to the fungal pathogen Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), an obligate biotrophic fungus that causes wheat powdery mildew and is responsible for up to 25% yield loss annually. In Australia, strobilurin resistant Bgt was first discovered in samples from Tasmania and Victoria in 2016. Molecular analysis revealed a nucleotide transversion in the cytochrome bc1 enzyme (cytb) complex, resulting in a substitution of alanine for glycine at position 143 (G143A) in Cytb.\n\nResultsWe have developed an in-field ASqPCR assay that can quantify both the resistant (A143) and sensitive (G143) cytb alleles down to 1.67% in host and Bgt DNA mixtures within 90 min of sample collection. The in situ analysis of field samples collected during a survey in Tasmania revealed A143 frequencies ranging between 9-100%. We validated the analysis with a newly developed laboratory based digital PCR assay and found no significant differences between the two methods.\n\nConclusionWe have successfully developed an in-field quantification method, for a QoI resistant allele, by pairing an ASqPCR assay on a lightweight qPCR instrument with a quick DNA extraction method. The deployment of this type of methodologies in the field can contribute to the effective in-season management of fungicide resistance.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLong INterspersed Element-1 (LINE-1) is an autonomous retroelement able to \"copy-and-paste\" itself into new loci of the host genome through a process called retrotransposition. The LINE-1 bicistronic mRNA codes for two proteins, ORF1p, a nucleic acid chaperone, and ORF2p, a protein with endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activity. Both proteins bind LINE-1 mRNA in cis and are necessary for retrotransposition. While LINE-1 transcription is usually repressed in most healthy somatic cells through a plethora of mechanisms, ORF1p expression has been observed in nearly 50% of tumors, and new LINE-1 insertions have been documented in a similar fraction of tumors, including prostate cancer.\n\nResultsHere, we utilized RNA ImmunoPrecipitation (RIP) and the L1EM analysis software to identify ORF1p bound RNA in prostate cancer cells. We identified LINE-1 loci that were expressed in androgen sensitive and androgen independent cells, that we show are representative of LINE-1 copies expressed in prostate cancer before and after treatment. In all androgen independent cells, we found higher levels of LINE-1 RNA, as well as unique expression patterns of LINE-1 loci. Interestingly, we observed that ORF1p bound many non-LINE-1 mRNA in all prostate cancer cell lines evaluated, and polyA RNA, and RNA localized in p-bodies were especially enriched. Furthermore, the expression levels of many of the identified ORF1p bound mRNAs also correlated with expression of LINE-1 RNA in prostate tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).\n\nConclusionOur results show a significant remodeling of LINE-1 loci expression in androgen independent cell lines when compared to parental androgen dependent cells, suggesting an evolution of LINE-1 expression during prostate cancer progression. Additionally, our finding that ORF1p bound a significant amount of non-LINE-1 mRNA, and that the enriched ORF1p bound mRNAs are also amplified in LINE-1 expressing TCGA prostate tumors, suggest that ORF1p may play a role in non-LINE-1 RNA processing and regulation of specific transcripts in prostate tumors.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have indicated critical roles of NAD+ deficiency in both aging and multiple major diseases. It is critical to investigate the mechanisms underlying the NAD+ deficiency under the pathological conditions. It has been reported that there was a decreased level of Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) - an important enzyme in the salvage pathway of NAD+ synthesis - under certain pathological conditions, while the mechanisms underlying the Nampt decrease require investigation. In this study we used differentiated PC12 cells as a cellular model to investigate the effects of oxidative stress on both the mRNA and protein levels of Nampt, as well as the role of this effect in oxidative stress-induced cell death: First, Nampt plays significant roles in both the NAD+ synthesis and survival of the cells under basal conditions; second, H2O2 produced significant decreases in both the mRNA levels and the protein levels of Nampt; and third, H2O2 induced cell death partially by producing the decreases in the mRNA and protein levels of Nampt, since the Nampt inhibitor or the Nampt activator significantly exacerbated or attenuated the H2O2-induced cell death, respectively. Collectively, our study has indicated that oxidative stress can decrease both the mRNA and protein levels of Nampt, which has indicated a novel mechanism underlying the NAD+ deficiency in aging and under multiple pathological conditions. Our study has also indicated that the decreased Nampt levels contribute to the H2O2-induced cell death, suggesting a new mechanism underlying oxidative cell death.",

    "abstract": "The golden-crowned (Zonotrichia atricapilla) and white-crowned (Z. leucophrys) sparrows have been presented as a compelling case for rapid speciation. They display divergence in song and plumage with overlap in their breeding ranges implying reproductive isolation, but have almost identical mitochondrial genomes. Previous research proposed hybridization and subsequent mitochondrial introgression as an alternate explanation, but lacked robust nuclear gene trees to distinguish between introgression and incomplete lineage sorting. We test for signatures of these processes between Z. atricapilla and Z. leucophrys, and investigate the relationships among Z. leucophrys subspecies, using mitochondrial sequencing and a reduced representation nuclear genomic dataset. Contrary to the paraphyly evident in mitochondrial gene trees, we confirmed the reciprocal monophyly of Z. atricapilla and Z. leucophrys using large panels of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs). The pattern of cytonuclear discordance is consistent with limited, historical hybridization and mitochondrial introgression, rather than a recent origin and incomplete lineage sorting between recent sister species. We found evidence of nuclear phylogeographic structure within Z. leucophrys with two distinct clades. Altogether, our results support the true species status of Z. atricapilla and Z. leucophrys, and indicate deeper divergences between the two species than inferred using mitochondrial markers. Our results demonstrate the limitations of relying solely on mitochondrial DNA for taxonomy, and raise questions about the possibility of selection on the mitochondrial genome during temperature oscillations (e.g. during the Pleistocene). Historical mitochondrial introgression facilitated by past environmental changes could cause erroneous dating of lineage splitting in other taxa when based on mitochondrial DNA alone.",

    "abstract": "Male animals are not given equal mating opportunities under competitive circumstances. Small males often exhibit alternative mating behaviours and produce spermatozoa of higher quality to compensate for their lower chances of winning physical contests against larger competitors [1]. Because the reproductive benefits of these phenotypes depend on social status/agonistic ranks that can change during growth or aging [2], sperm traits should be developed/switched into fitness optima according to their prospects. However, reproductive success largely relies upon social contexts arising instantaneously from intra- and inter-sexual interactions, which deter males from developing extreme traits and instead favour behavioural plasticity. Nevertheless, the extent to which such plasticity influences developmentally regulated alternative sperm traits remains unexplored. Squids of the family Loliginidae are excellent models to investigate this, because they show sophisticated alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs) by which small males, known as \"sneakers\", produce longer spermatozoa and perform extra-pair copulation to attach their sperm packages near the female seminal receptacle (SR). In contrast, large \"consort\" males have shorter spermatozoa and copulate via pair-bonding to insert their sperm packages near the internal female oviduct [3]. In addition, plasticity in male mating behaviour is common in some species while it is either rare or absent in others. Thus, squid ARTs display a broad spectrum of adaptive traits with a complex repertoire in behaviour, morphology and physiology [3].",

    "abstract": "The human GlyT1 glycine transporter requires chloride for its function. However, the mechanism by which Cl- exerts its influence is unknown. To examine the role that Cl- plays in the transport cycle, we measured the effect of Cl- on both glycine binding and conformational changes. The ability of glycine to displace the high-affinity radioligand [3H]CHIBA-3007 required Na+ and was potentiated over 1000-fold by Cl-. We generated GlyT1b mutants containing reactive cysteine residues in either the extracellular or cytoplasmic permeation pathways and measured changes in the reactivity of those cysteine residues as indicators of conformational changes in response to ions and substrate. Na+ increased accessibility in the extracellular pathway and decreased it in the cytoplasmic pathway, consistent with stabilizing an outward-open conformation as observed in other members of this transporter family. In the presence of Na+, both glycine and Cl- independently shifted the conformation of GlyT1b toward an outward-closed conformation. Together, Na+, glycine and Cl- stabilized an inward-open conformation of GlyT1b. We then examined whether Cl- acts by interacting with a conserved glutamine to allow formation of an ion pair that stabilizes the closed state of the extracellular pathway. Molecular dynamics simulations of a GlyT1 homologue indicated that this ion pair is formed more frequently as that pathway closes. Mutation of the glutamine blocked the effect of Cl-, and substituting it with glutamate or lysine resulted in outward- or inward-facing transporter conformations, respectively. These results provide novel and unexpected insight into the role of Cl- in this family of transporters.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in proteins can regulate their activity by facilitating protein-protein interactions (PPIs) as exemplified in the recruitment of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) protein by the protein eIF4G. Deregulation of this PPI module is central to a broad spectrum of cancer related malignancies and its targeted inhibition through bioactive peptides is a promising strategy for therapeutic intervention. We have employed a structure-guided approach to rationally develop peptide derivatives from the intrinsically disordered eIF4G scaffold by incorporating non-natural amino acids that facilitates disorder-to-order transition. The conformational heterogeneity of these peptides and the degree of structural reorganization required to adopt the optimum mode of interaction with eIF4E underscores their differential binding affinities. The presence of a pre-structured local helical element in the ensemble of structures was instrumental in the efficient docking of the peptides on to the protein surface. These insights were exploited to further design features into the peptide to propagate bound-state conformations in solution which resulted in the generation of a potent eIF4E binder. The study illustrates the molecular basis of eIF4E recognition by a disordered epitope from eIF4G and its modulation to generate peptides that can potentially attenuate translation initiation in oncology.",

However, molecular mechanisms by which these microbes affect host response to immunotherapy remain elusive. Here we show that specific members of the bacterial genus Enterococcus can promote anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy in mouse tumor models. The active enterococci express and secrete orthologs of the NlpC/p60 peptidoglycan hydrolase SagA that generate immune-active muropeptides. Expression of SagA in non-protective E. faecalis was sufficient to promote antitumor activity of clinically approved checkpoint targets, and its activity required the peptidoglycan sensor Nod2. Notably, SagA-engineered probiotics or synthetic muropeptides also promoted checkpoint inhibitor antitumor activity. Our data suggest that microbiota species with unique peptidoglycan remodeling activity may enhance immunotherapy and could be leveraged for next-generation adjuvants.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA conserved family of secreted NlpC/p60 peptidoglycan hydrolases from Enterococcus promote antitumor activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveAn aggressive basal-like molecular subtype of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) exists, driven by {Delta}Np63. In other epithelia, {Delta}Np63+ basal cells have stem cell capacity and can be at the origin of tumors. In the pancreas, basal cells have not been identified.\n\nDesignWe assessed basal cell markers in human and mouse pancreas, chronic pancreatitis and PDAC, and developed a 3D imaging protocol (FLIP-IT) to study sizeable samples at single cell resolution. We generated organoid cultures of ducts from Sox9-eGFP reporter mice.\n\nResultsIn normal human pancreas, rare {Delta}Np63+ cells exist in ducts that expand in chronic pancreatitis. {Delta}Np63+ cells express KRT19 and canonical basal markers (KRT5, KRT14 and S100A2) but lack markers of duct cells such as CA19.9 and SOX9. In addition, {Delta}Np63+ cells pertain to a niche of cells expressing gastrointestinal stem cell markers. 3D views of the ductal tree in formalin fixed paraffin embedded samples show that basal cells are localized on the basal membrane of medium to large ducts and expand as multilayer dome-like structures in chronic pancreatitis. In mice, {Delta}Np63 expression is induced when culturing organoids from Sox9-low ductal cells but could not be found in normal pancreas nor in models of pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer.\n\nConclusionWe discovered a novel ductal cell population in normal human pancreas similar to basal cells in other tissues. Using FLIP-IT, we provide unprecedented 3D visualization of these cells in archival clinical specimens. {Delta}Np63+ cells may play an important role in pancreatic tissue regeneration and cancer.\n\nSUMMARY BOXWhat is already known about this subject? O_LI{Delta}Np63 has a central role in determining the basal-like subtype of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).\nC_LIO_LIDifferent to other tissues with basal cancers, the normal pancreas reportedly does not contain ({Delta}Np63-expressing) basal cells.\nC_LIO_LICurrent protocols face severe limitations for marker-based identification and 3D imaging of individual (rare) cells in archival pancreatic samples.\nC_LI\n\nWhat are the new findings? O_LIWe report a rare and atypical pancreatic duct cell that expresses {Delta}Np63, other basal cell markers and g.i. stem cell markers.\nC_LIO_LIThe number of these basal cells increases in diseases such as chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer.\nC_LIO_LIWe provide an easy to implement protocol for 3D clearing and high-resolution imaging of sizeable samples of (fresh or FFPE) human pancreas or an entire mouse pancreas.\nC_LIO_LIExcept after culturing medium to large ducts as organoids, we fail to detect basal cells in mouse experimental pancreatic models.\nC_LI\n\nHow might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future? O_LIExtrapolating from knowledge in other organs, basal cells in the pancreas may have a stem cell/progenitor role, including in diseases such as (basal) pancreatic cancer.\nC_LIO_LIUse of the 3D imaging protocol in archival clinical specimens will allow unprecedented insights in pancreatic histopathology.\nC_LIO_LIFor above mentioned diseases, we caution for findings in experimental mouse models that may not (fully) recapitulate the etiopathogenesis.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Although we have a good understanding of the development of shoot apical meristems (SAM) in higher plants, and the function of the stem cells (SCs) embedded in the SAM, there is surprisingly little known of its molecular responses to abiotic stresses. Here, we show that the SAM of Arabidopsis thaliana senses heat stress (HS) and retains an autonomous molecular memory of a previous non-lethal HS, allowing the SAM to regain growth after exposure to an otherwise lethal HS several days later. Using RNA-seq, we identified genes participating in establishing a SAM-specific HS memory. The genes include HEAT SHOCK TRANSCRIPTION FACTORs (HSFs), of which HSFA2 is essential, but not sufficient, for full HS memory in the SAM, the SC regulators CLAVATA1 (CLV1) and CLV3, and several primary carbohydrate metabolism genes, including FRUCTOSE-BISPHOSPHATE ALDOLASE 6 (FBA6). We found that expression of FBA6 during HS at the SAM complements that of FBA8 in the same organ. Furthermore, we show that sugar availability at the SAM is essential for survival at high-temperature HS. Collectively, plants have evolved a sophisticated protection mechanism to maintain SCs and, hence, their capacity to re-initiate shoot growth after stress release.",

In the resulting lines leaf Rubisco protein content was reduced by between 30-50% and CO2 assimilation rate was limited under photorespiratory and non-photorespiratory conditions. A relationship between Rubisco protein content and CO2 assimilation rate was found. This was associated with a significant reduction in dry biomass accumulation and grain yield of between 37 to 70%. In addition to serving as a resource for reducing Rubisco accumulation in a cell-preferential manner, these lines allow us to characterize gene function and isoform specific suppression on photosynthesis and growth. Our results suggest that the knockdown of multiple genes is required to completely reduce Rubisco accumulation in MCs.",

To gain biological insights from live-cell imaging data, it is necessary to identify individual cells, follow them over time and extract quantitative information. However, since often biological experiment does not allow the high temporal resolution to reduce excessive levels of illumination or minimize unnecessary oversampling to monitor long-term dynamics, it is still a challenging task to obtain good tracking results with coarsely sampled imaging data. To address this problem, we consider cell tracking problem as \"stable matching problem\" and propose a robust tracking method based on Voronoi partition which adapts parameters that need to be set according to the spatio-temporal characteristics of live cell imaging data such as cell population and migration. We demonstrate the performance improvement provided by the proposed method using numerical simulations and compare its performance with proximity-based tracking and nearest neighbor-based tracking.",

The Pabpn1l -/- oocytes can be produced, ovulated and fertilized normally, but cannot develop beyond the 2-cell stage. Using RNA-Seq, we found a large-scale upregulation of RNA in Pabpn1l -/- MII oocytes. Of the 2401 transcripts upregulated in Pabpn1l-/- MII oocytes, 1523 transcripts (63.4%) were also upregulated in Btg4 -/- MII oocytes, while only 53 transcripts (2.2%) were upregulated in Ythdf2 -/- MII oocytes. We documented that transcripts in zygotes derived from Pabpn1l -/- oocytes have a longer poly(A) tail than the control group, a phenomenon similar to that in Btg4-/- mice. Surprisingly, the poly(A) tail of these mRNAs was significantly shorter in the Pabpn1l -/- MII oocytes than in the Pabpn1l +/+. These results suggest that PABPN1L is involved in BTG4-mediated maternal mRNA degradation, and may antagonize poly(A) tail shortening in oocytes independently of its involvement in maternal mRNA degradation. Thus, PABPN1L variants could be a genetic marker of female infertility.",

    "abstract": "Foraging behavior, as an energy-consuming behavior, is very important for collective survival in termites. How energy metabolism related to glucose decomposition and ATP production influences foraging behavior in termites is still unclear. Here, we analyzed the change in energy metabolism in the whole organism and brain after silencing the key metabolic gene isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and then investigated its impact on foraging behavior in the subterranean termite Odontotermes formosanus in different social contexts. The IDH gene exhibited higher expression in the abdomen and head of O. formosanus. The knockdown of IDH resulted in metabolic disorders in the whole organism, including the impairment of the NAD+-IDH reaction and decreased ATP levels and glucose accumulation. The dsIDH-injected workers showed significantly reduced walking activity but increased foraging success. Interestingly, IDH downregulation altered brain energy metabolism, resulting in a decline in ATP levels and an increase in IDH activity. Additionally, the social context obviously affected brain energy metabolism and, thus, altered foraging behavior in O. formosanus. We found that the presence of predator ants increased the negative influence on the foraging behavior of dsIDH-injected workers, including a decrease in foraging success. However, an increase in the number of nestmate soldiers could provide social buffering to relieve the adverse effect of predator ants on worker foraging behavior. Our orthogonal experiments further verified that the role of the IDH gene as an inherent factor was dominant in manipulating termite foraging behavior compared with external social contexts, suggesting that energy metabolism, especially brain energy metabolism, plays a crucial role in regulating termite foraging behavior.\n\nAuthor summaryForaging behavior plays a key role in collective survival in social insects, as found in termites. Worker termites are responsible for foraging duty and exhibit large foraging areas and long foraging distances, so they need to consume much energy during foraging. It is well established that energy can influence insect behaviors. However, how energy metabolism affects foraging behavior in termites remains unknown. Here, we found that the downregulation of the conserved metabolic gene IDH impaired whole-organism and the brain energy metabolism and further altered foraging behavior, resulting in decreased walking activity but increased foraging success in the termite O. formosanus, which is an important insect pest damaging embankments and trees in China. Additionally, the social context affected brain energy metabolism and obviously changed foraging behavior in O. formosanus, causing a decline in foraging success in the absence of nestmate soldiers and the presence of predator ants. However, the increasing number of nestmate soldiers strengthened social buffering to relieve the negative effect of predator ants on worker foraging behavior. Our findings provide new insights into the underlying molecular mechanism involved in modulating the sophisticated foraging strategy of termites in different social contexts from the perspective of energy metabolism.",

Eurycomanone (EN), one of the most common quassinoids, is said to have beneficial effects on lipid and glucose metabolism. In this study, we investigated the effects of EN on lipolysis by establishing a high-fat animal model in vivo and evaluated its efficacy as a lipolytic and anti-fatty liver agent. Oil red O staining showed morphological changes of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes after EN treatment and confirmed the inhibitory effects of EN on adipocyte differentiation. The mechanism of EN promotes lipolysis in 3T3-L1 cells was analyzed by immunofluorescence, Western blotting, quantitative real-time PCR and siRNA transfection. In C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet, intragastric administration of EN (5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) for two weeks, decreased fat droplet mass and size, and reduced fat accumulation in the liver. Furthermore, EN activated PKA and promoted the PKA/hormone sensitive lipase lipolysis signaling pathway, thereby increasing the release of glycerol and free fatty acids from adipocytes. Our findings indicate the potential of EN as a promising alternative pharmacologic agent for the prevention of obesity.",

    "abstract": "Monitoring of marine protected areas (MPAs) is critical for marine ecosystem management, yet current protocols rely on SCUBA-based visual surveys that are costly and time consuming, limiting their scope and effectiveness. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is a promising alternative for marine ecosystem monitoring, but more direct comparisons to visual surveys are needed to understand the strengths and limitations of each approach. This study compares fish communities inside and outside the Scorpion State Marine Reserve off Santa Cruz Island, CA using eDNA metabarcoding and underwater visual census surveys. Results from eDNA captured 76% (19/25) of fish species and 95% (19/20) of fish genera observed during pairwise underwater visual census. Species missed by eDNA were due to the inability of MiFish 12S barcodes to differentiate species of rockfishes (Sebastes, n=4) or low site occupancy rates of crevice-dwelling Lythrypnus gobies. However, eDNA detected an additional 30 fish species not recorded in paired visual surveys, but previously reported from prior visual surveys, highlighting the sensitivity of eDNA. Significant variation in eDNA signatures by location (50m) and site (~1000m) demonstrates the sensitivity of eDNA to address key questions such as community composition inside and outside MPAs. Interestingly, eDNA results recorded higher species richness outside the MPA while visual surveys observed the opposite pattern. This result is likely caused by swamping effects of high fish abundance in MPAs that reduce detection probabilities of pelagic and intertidal taxa. Results demonstrate the utility of eDNA metabarcoding for monitoring marine ecosystems, providing an important complementary tool to visual methods.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPlasma omentin levels have been shown to be associated with circulating adiponectin concentrations and cardiometabolic disease-related outcomes. However, the findings have been inconsistent due to high level of confounding. In this study, we aim to examine the association of omentin gene polymorphism with plasma adiponectin levels and cardiometabolic health status using a genetic approach, which is less prone to confounding, and investigate whether these associations are modified by lifestyle factors such as diet and physical activity.\n\nMethodsThe study included 945 normal glucose tolerant and 941 unrelated individuals with type 2 diabetes randomly selected from the Chennai Urban Rural Epidemiology Study (CURES), in southern India. Study participants were further classified into cardiometabolically healthy and unhealthy, where cardiometabolically healthy were those without hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Fasting serum adiponectin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. The A326T (rs2274907) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the exon 4 of the omentin gene was screened by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and direct sequencing.\n\nResultsThe  A allele of the omentin SNP was significantly associated with lower adiponectin concentrations after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and cardiometabolic health status (p=1.90 x 10-47). There was also a significant association between circulating adiponectin concentrations and cardiometabolic health status after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, WC and Omentin SNP (p=7.47x10-10). However, after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, WC and adiponectin levels, the association of  A allele with cardiometabolic health status disappeared (p=0.79) suggesting that adiponectin serves as a mediator of the association between omentin SNP and cardiometabolic health status. There were no significant interactions between the SNP and dietary factors on adiponectin levels and cardiometabolic health status (p>0.25, for all comparisons).\n\nConclusionsOur findings show that adiponectin might function as a mechanistic link between omentin SNP and increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases independent of common and central obesity in this Asian Indian population. Further studies are required to confirm the molecular mechanisms involved in this triangular relationship between omentin gene, adiponectin and cardiometabolic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Collective behavior emerges from local interactions between group members, and natural selection can fine-tune these interactions to achieve different collective outcomes. However, at least in principle, collective behavior can also evolve via changes in group-level parameters. Here, we show that army ant mass raiding, an iconic collective behavior in which many thousands of ants spontaneously leave the nest to go hunting, has evolved from group raiding, in which a scout directs a much smaller group of ants to a specific target. We describe the structure of group raids in the clonal raider ant, a close relative of army ants. We find that the coarse structure of group raids and mass raids is highly conserved, and that army ants and their relatives likely follow similar behavioral rules, despite the fact that their raids differ strikingly in overall appearance. By experimentally increasing colony size in the clonal raider ant, we show that mass raiding gradually emerges from group raiding without altering individual behavioral rules. This suggests a simple mechanism for the evolution of army ant mass raids, and more generally that scaling effects may provide an alternative mechanism for evolutionary transitions in complex collective behavior.",

Comparing different evolutionary models with data, we find that replication origin birth and death events are mainly driven by two evolutionary pressures, the first imposes that events leading to higher double-stall probability of replication forks are penalized, while the second makes less efficient origins more prone to evolutionary loss.
