    "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii infection activates pattern recognition receptor (PRR) pathways that drive innate inflammatory responses to control infection. Necroptosis is a pro-inflammatory cell death pathway apart of the innate immune response that has evolved to control pathogenic infection. In this study we further defined the role of Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1) as a PRR and assessed its contribution to necroptosis as a host protection mechanism to T. gondii infection. We found that ZBP1 does not induce pro-inflammatory necroptosis cell death and ZBP1 null mice have reduced survival after oral T. gondii infection. In contrast, mice deleted in receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (RIPK3-/-), a central mediator of necroptosis, have significantly improved survival after oral T. gondii infection even with higher parasite burden. The physiological consequences of RIPK3 activity did not show any differences in intestine villi immunopathology but RIPK3-/- mice showed higher immune cell infiltration and edema in the lamina propria. The contribution of necroptosis to host survival was clarified with mixed lineage kinase domain like pseudokinase null (MLKL-/-) mice. We found MLKL-/- mice to succumb to oral T. gondii infection the same as wild type mice, indicating necroptosis-independent RIPK3 activity impacts host survival. These results provide new insights on the impacts of pro-inflammatory cell death pathways as a mechanism of host defense to oral T. gondii infection.",

    "abstract": "Haptic object perception begins with continuous exploratory contacts, and the human brain needs to accumulate sensory information continuously over time. However, it is still unclear how the primary sensorimotor cortex (PSC) interacts with these higher-level regions during haptic exploration across time. This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study investigates time-dependent haptic object processing by examining brain activity during haptic 3D curve and roughness estimation. For this experiment, we designed sixteen haptic stimuli (4 kinds of curve x 4 kinds of roughness) for the haptic curve and roughness estimation tasks. Twenty participants were asked to move their right index and middle fingers along with the surface twice and to estimate one of the two features--roughness or curvature--dependent on the task instruction. We found that the brain activity in several higher-level regions (e.g., bilateral posterior parietal cortex) linearly increased with curvature through the haptic exploration phase. Surprisingly, we found that the contralateral PSC was parametrically modulated by the number of curves only during the late exploration phase, but not during the early exploration phase. In contrast, we found no similar parametric modulation activity patterns for haptic roughness estimation in either the contralateral PSC or in the higher-level regions. Together, our findings suggest that haptic 3D object perception is processed across the cortical hierarchy, while the contralateral PSC interacts with other higher-level regions across time in a manner that is dependent upon object features.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe observed the brain activity of haptic object perception using parametric stimuli.\nC_LIO_LIHaptic curve estimation showed parametric modulation across the cortical hierarchy.\nC_LIO_LICurve parametric modulation in the sensorimotor cortex showed time dependency.\nC_LIO_LIRoughness parametric modulation showed very little dependency in any regions of the brain.\nC_LIO_LIThese findings reflect the nature of time-dependent haptic object processing in the brain.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Miscanthus is a commercial lignocellulosic biomass crop owing to its high biomass productivity and low chemical input requirements. Interspecific Miscanthus hybrids with high biomass yield were shown to have low concentrations of starch and sucrose but high concentrations of fructose. We performed a transcriptional RNA-seq analysis between selected Miscanthus hybrids with contrasting values for these phenotypes to clarify how these phenotypes are genetically controlled. We observed that genes directly involved in the synthesis and degradation of starch and sucrose were down-regulated in high yielding Miscanthus hybrids. At the same time, glycolysis and export of triose phosphates were up-regulated in high yielding Miscanthus hybrids. Our results evidence a direct relationship between high expression of essential enzymatic genes in the starch and sucrose pathways, high starch concentrations, and lower biomass production. The strong interconnectivity between genotype, chemotype and agronomic traits opens the door to use the expression of well-characterised genes in the starch and sucrose pathway for the early selection of high biomass yielding genotypes from large Miscanthus populations.",

    "abstract": "Since cell penetrating peptides are promising tools for delivery of cargo into cells, factors limiting or facilitating their cellular uptake are intensely studied. Using labeling with pH-insensitive and pH-sensitive dyes we report that escape of penetratin from acidic endo-lysosomal compartments is retarded compared to its cellular uptake. The membrane dipole potential, known to alter transmembrane transport of charged molecules, is shown to be negatively correlated with the concentration of penetratin in the cytoplasmic compartment. Treatment of cells with therapeutically relevant concentrations of atorvastatin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis, significantly increased the release of penetratin from acidic endocytic compartments in two different cell types. This effect of atorvastatin correlated with its ability to decrease the membrane dipole potential. These results highlight the importance of the dipole potential in regulating cellular uptake of cell penetrating peptides and suggest a clinically relevant way of boosting this process.",

    "abstract": "The emerging novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has created a global confusing pandemic health crisis that warrants an accurate and detailed characterization of the rapidly evolving viral genome for understanding its epidemiology, pathogenesis and containment. We explored 61,485 sequences of the Nucleocapsid (N) protein, a potent diagnostic and prophylactic target, for identifying the mutations to review their roles in RT-PCR based diagnosis and observe consequent impacts. Compared to the Wuhan reference strain, a total of 1034 unique nucleotide mutations were identified in the mutant strains (49.15%, n=30,221) globally. Of these mutations, 367 occupy primer binding sites including 3-end mismatch to primer-pair of 11 well characterized primer sets. Noteworthy, CDC (USA) recommended N2 primer set contained lower mismatch than the other primer sets. Moreover, 684 amino acid (aa) substitutions located across 317 (75.66% of total aa) unique positions including 82, 21, and 83 of those in RNA binding N-terminal domain (NTD), SR-rich region, and C-terminal dimerization domain (CTD), respectively. Moreover, 11 in-frame deletions were revealed, mostly (n =10) within the highly flexible linker region, and the rest within the NTD region. Furthermore, we predicted the possible consequences of high-frequency mutations ([&ge;] 20) and deletions on the tertiary structure of the N protein. Remarkably, we observed that high frequency (67.94% of mutated sequences) coevolving mutations (R203K and G204R) destabilized and decreased overall structural flexibility. Despite being proposed as the alternate target to spike protein for vaccine and therapeutics, ongoing nonsynonymous evolution of the N protein may challenge the endeavors, thus need further immunoinformatics analyses. Therefore, continuous monitoring is required for tracing the ongoing evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein in prophylactic and diagnostic interventions.",

Predicting the effects of microbial evolution on global elemental cycles remains a significant challenge due to the sheer number of interacting environmental and trait combinations. Here we present an approach for integrating multivariate trait data into a predictive model of trait evolution. We investigated the outcome of thousands of possible adaptive walks parameterized using empirical evolution data from the alga Chlamydomonas exposed to high CO2. We found that the direction of historical bias (existing trait correlations) influenced both the rate of adaptation and the evolved phenotypes (trait combinations). Critically, we use fitness landscapes derived directly from empirical trait values to capture known evolutionary phenomena. This work demonstrates that ecological models need to represent both changes in traits and changes in the correlation between traits in order to accurately capture phytoplankton evolution and predict future shifts in elemental cycling.",

Interleukin 22 (IL-22) is an effective therapeutic antidote for kidney injury via promoting kidney recovery, but little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Here we first provide evidence that IL-22 attenuates kidney injury via metabolic reprogramming of renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs). Specifically, our data suggest that IL-22 regulates mitochondrial function and glycolysis in damaged TECs. Further observations indicate that IL-22 alleviates the accumulation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and dysfunctional mitochondria via the induction of AMPK/AKT signaling and PFBFK3 activities. In mice, amelioration of kidney injury and necrosis and improvement of kidney functions via regulation of these metabolism relevant signaling and mitochondrial fitness of recombinant IL-22 are certificated in cisplatin induced kidney damage and diabetic nephropathy (DN) animal models. Taken together, our findings unravel new mechanistic insights into protective effects of IL-22 on kidney and highlight the therapeutic opportunities of IL-22 and the involved metabolic regulators in various kidney diseases.",

    "abstract": "Nicotiana benthamiana is used extensively as a platform for transient gene expression and as a model system for studying plant-virus interactions. However, many tobacco-feeding generalist herbivores, including Myzus persicae (green peach aphid), Bemisia tabaci (whitefly), Macrosiphum euphorbiae (potato aphid), Heliothis virescens (tobacco budworm), Trichoplusia ni (cabbage looper), and Helicoverpa zea (corn earworm), grow poorly on N. benthamiana, limiting its utility for research on plant-insect interactions. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we generated knockout mutations in two N. benthamiana acylsugar acyltransferases, ASAT1 and ASAT2, which contribute to the biosynthesis of insect-deterrent acylsucroses. Whereas asat1 mutations reduced the abundance of two predominant acylsucroses, asat2 mutations caused almost complete depletion of foliar acylsucroses. The tested hemipteran and lepidopteran species survived, gained weight, and/or reproduced significantly better on asat2 mutant plants than on wildtype N. benthamiana. Furthermore, both asat1 and asat2 mutations reduced the water content and increased the temperature of leaves, indicating that foliar acylsucroses can protect against desiccation. Two experiments demonstrated the utility of the N. benthamiana asat2 mutant line for insect bioassays. Transmission of turnip mosaic virus by M. persicae was significantly improved by an asat2 mutation. Tobacco rattle virus constructs were used for virus-induced gene silencing of acetylcholinesterase, squalene synthase, toll-like receptor 7, and tubulin-specific chaperon D genes in B. tabaci, an experiment that would have been difficult with wild-type N. benthamiana due to high insect mortality. Additionally, the absence of acylsugars in asat2 mutant lines will simplify transient expression assays for the functional analysis of acylsugar biosynthesis genes from other Solanaceae.",

Understanding the immune cell states shared between COVID-19 and other inflammatory diseases with established therapies may help nominate immunomodulatory therapies.

Our cross-disease analysis revealed that an FCN1+ inflammatory macrophage state is common to COVID-19 bronchoalveolar lavage samples, RA synovium, CD ileum, and UC colon. We also observed that a CXCL10+ CCL2+ inflammatory macrophage state is abundant in severe COVID-19, inflamed CD and RA, and expresses inflammatory genes such as GBP1, STAT1, and IL1B. We found that the CXCL10+ CCL2+ macrophages are transcriptionally similar to blood-derived macrophages stimulated with TNF- and IFN-{gamma} ex vivo. Our findings suggest that IFN-{gamma}, alongside TNF-, might be a key driver of this abundant inflammatory macrophage phenotype in severe COVID-19 and other inflammatory diseases, which may be targeted by existing immunomodulatory therapies.",

    "abstract": "Some patients infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) develop severe pneumonia and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1]. Distinct clinical features in these patients have led to speculation that the immune response to virus in the SARS-CoV-2-infected alveolus differs from other types of pneumonia [2]. We collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from 86 patients with SARS-CoV-2-induced respiratory failure and 252 patients with known or suspected pneumonia from other pathogens and subjected them to flow cytometry and bulk transcriptomic profiling. We performed single cell RNA-Seq in 5 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples collected from patients with severe COVID-19 within 48 hours of intubation. In the majority of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection at the onset of mechanical ventilation, the alveolar space is persistently enriched in alveolar macrophages and T cells without neutrophilia. Bulk and single cell transcriptomic profiling suggest SARS-CoV-2 infects alveolar macrophages that respond by recruiting T cells. These T cells release interferon-gamma to induce inflammatory cytokine release from alveolar macrophages and further promote T cell recruitment. Our results suggest SARS-CoV-2 causes a slowly unfolding, spatially-limited alveolitis in which alveolar macrophages harboring SARS-CoV-2 transcripts and T cells form a positive feedback loop that drives progressive alveolar inflammation.\n\nThis manuscript is accompanied by an online resource: https://www.nupulmonary.org/covid-19/\n\nOne sentence summarySARS-CoV-2-infected alveolar macrophages form positive feedback loops with T cells in patients with severe COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Viral recombination can generate novel genotypes with unique phenotypic characteristics, including transmissibility and virulence. Although the capacity for recombination among betacoronaviruses is well documented, there is limited evidence of recombination between SARS-CoV-2 strains. By identifying the mutations that primarily determine SARS-CoV-2 clade structure, we developed a lightweight approach for detecting recombinant genomes. Among the over 537,000 genomes queried, we detect 1175 putative recombinants that contain multiple mutational markers from distinct clades. Additional phylogenetic analysis and the observed co-circulation of predicted parent clades in the geographic regions of exposure further support the feasibility of recombination in these detected cases. An analysis of these detected cases did not reveal any evidence for recombination hotspots in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Although most recombinant genotypes were detected a limited number of times, at least two recombinants are now widely transmitted. Recombinant genomes were also found to contain substitutions of concern for elevated transmissibility and lower vaccine efficacy, including D614G, N501Y, E484K, and L452R. Adjusting for an unequal probability of detecting recombinants derived from different parent clades, and for geographic variation in clade abundance, we estimate that at most 5% of circulating viruses in the USA and UK are recombinant. While the phenotypic characterization of detected recombinants was beyond the scope of our analysis, the identification of transmitted recombinants involving substitutions of concern underscores the need to sustain efforts to monitor the emergence of new genotypes generated through recombination.",

Molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) forms the mainstay in screening, diagnosis and epidemiology of disease. The virus has been evolving through base substitutions. The recent availability of genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from different countries including India motivated us to assess the presence and potential impact of variations in target sites for the oligonucleotide primers and probes used in molecular diagnosis. We catalogued a total of 132 primers or probes sequences from the literature and the public domain. Our analysis revealed a total of 125 unique genetic variants in 80 either primers or probes binding sites. A total of 13 unique variants had allele frequency of [&ge;] 1% in Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes mapped to the primers or probes binding sites. A total of 15 primers or probes binding sites had cumulative variant frequency of [&ge;] 1% in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. These included primers or probes sites which are widely used in India and across the world for molecular diagnosis as well as approved by national and international agencies. This highlights the need for sequencing genomes of emerging pathogens to make evidence based policies for development and approval of diagnostics. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the most comprehensive analysis of genomic variants in genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from India and their potential impact on efficacy of molecular diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created an urgent need for therapeutics that inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 virus and suppress the fulminant inflammation characteristic of advanced illness. Here, we describe the anti-COVID-19 potential of PTC299, an orally available compound that is a potent inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), the rate-limiting enzyme of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. In tissue culture, PTC299 manifests robust, dose-dependent, and DHODH-dependent inhibition of SARS CoV-2 replication (EC50 range, 2.0 to 31.6 nM) with a selectivity index >3,800. PTC299 also blocked replication of other RNA viruses, including Ebola virus. Consistent with known DHODH requirements for immunomodulatory cytokine production, PTC299 inhibited the production of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17A (also called IL-17), IL-17F, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in tissue culture models. The combination of anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, cytokine inhibitory activity, and previously established favorable pharmacokinetic and human safety profiles render PTC299 a promising therapeutic for COVID-19.",

In vitro, H3 K27M and EZHIP are competitive inhibitors of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) lysine methyltransferase activity. In vivo, these proteins reduce overall H3K27me3 levels, however residual peaks of H3K27me3 remain at CpG islands through an unknown mechanism. Here, we report that EZHIP and H3 K27M preferentially interact with an allosterically activated form of PRC2 in vivo. The formation of H3 K27M- and EZHIP-PRC2 complexes occurs at CpG islands containing H3K27me3 and impedes PRC2 and H3K27me3 spreading. While EZHIP is not found outside of placental mammals, we find that expression of human EZHIP reduces H3K27me3 in Drosophila melanogaster through a conserved molecular mechanism. Our results highlight the mechanistic similarities between EZHIP and H3 K27M in vivo and provide mechanistic insight for the retention of residual H3K27me3 in tumors driven by these oncogenes.",

    "abstract": "Repair of Cas9-induced double-stranded breaks results primarily in formation of small indels, but can also cause potentially harmful large deletions. While mechanisms leading to the creation of small indels are relatively well understood, very little is known about the origins of large deletions. Using a novel library of clonal mouse embryonic stem cells bona fide deficient for 32 DNA repair genes, we have shown that large deletion frequency increases in cells impaired for non-homologous end joining and decreases in cells deficient for the central resection gene Nbn and the microhomology-mediated end joining gene Polq. Across deficient clones, increase in large deletion frequency was closely correlated with the increase in the extent of microhomology and the size of small indels, implying a continuity of repair processes across different genomic scales. Furthermore, by targeting diverse genomic sites, we identified examples of repair processes that were highly locus-specific, discovering a novel role for exonuclease Trex1. Finally, we present evidence that indel sizes increase with the overall efficiency of Cas9 mutagenesis. These findings may have impact on both basic research and clinical use of CRISPR-Cas9, in particular in conjunction with repair pathway modulation.",

    "abstract": "The caseinolytic protease (ClpP) complex in Leptospira interrogans is unusual in its functional activation. The genus Leptospira has two ClpPs, ClpP1 and ClpP2, which transcribes independently, regardless it couples to form the active tetradecamer. Acyldepsipeptide (ADEP) antibiotic hampers the growth of numerous bacterial species by activating the target protein ClpP and dysregulating the physiological proteostasis within the cell. In vitro culture of the L. interrogans fortified with the ADEP impeded the spirochete growth accompanied by a more elongated morphology. The chemoactivation of the ClpP is conditional on the duration of the self-compartmentalization of each of the ClpP isoforms. The small extent (10 min) self-assembled ClpP1P2 revealed inhibition in the peptidase activity (7-fold) in the presence of the ADEP due to the self-cleavage of the ClpP subunits. On supplementation of the {beta}-casein or bovine serum albumin, the peptidase activity of the ClpP1P2 (short-incubated) got enhanced by the ADEP, while the ClpP1P2 (long-incubated) activity was retained to the same level. ADEP can also switch on the ClpP1P2 from a strict peptidase into proteolytic machinery that discerns and degrades the unfolded protein substrates autonomous of the cognate chaperone ClpX. In consensus to the most prokaryotes with the multi ClpP variants, the computational prototype of the ClpP1P2 tertiary structure infers that the hydrophobic pocket wherein the ADEPs predominantly docks are present in the ClpP2 heptamer. Additionally, the dynamic light scattering and the site-directed mutagenesis of a catalytic serine residue in either of the ClpP isoforms proposes a second interaction site for the ADEP.",

    "abstract": "The ability of epithelial tissues to heal after injury is essential for animal life, yet the mechanisms by which epithelial cells sense tissue damage are incompletely understood. In aquatic organisms such as zebrafish, osmotic shock following injury is believed to be an early and potent activator of a wound response. We find that, in addition to sensing osmolarity, basal skin cells in zebrafish larvae are also sensitive to changes in the particular ionic composition of their surroundings after wounding, specifically the concentration of sodium chloride in the immediate vicinity of the wound. This sodium chloride-specific wound detection mechanism is independent of cell swelling, and instead is suggestive of a mechanism by which cells sense changes in the transepithelial electrical potential generated by the transport of sodium and chloride ions across the skin. Consistent with this hypothesis, we show that electric fields directly applied within the skin are sufficient to initiate actin polarization and migration of basal cells in their native epithelial context in vivo, even overriding endogenous wound signaling. This suggests that, in order to mount a robust wound response, skin cells respond to both osmotic and electrical perturbations arising from tissue injury.",

    "abstract": "Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common type of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Altered epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) levels can contribute to tumor metastasis and resistance to therapies. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), by which epithelial cells acquire a mesenchymal and invasive phenotype, contributes significantly to tumor metastasis in OSCC, and EGFR signaling is known to promote this process. Microtubule inhibition therapies cause EGFR inactivation or increase the sensitivity to EGFR targeting drugs in various cancers including OSCC. In this study, using OSCC model, we show that loss of a microtubule/tubulin binding protein, centrosomal protein 4.1-associated protein (CPAP), which is critical for centriole biogenesis and normal functioning of centrosome, caused an increase in the EGFR levels and signaling and, enhanced the EMT features and invasiveness of OSCC cells. Further, depletion of CPAP increased the tumorigenicity of these cells in a xeno-transplant model. Importantly, CPAP loss-associated EMT features and invasiveness of multiple OSCC cells were attenuated upon depletion of EGFR in them. Overall, our novel observations suggest that in addition to its previously known regulatory role in centrosome biogenesis and function, CPAP plays an important role in suppressing EMT and tumorigenesis in OSCC by regulating EGFR homeostasis and signaling.",

Using Foxn1-/- mice that can heal skin injuries in a unique scarless manner, we investigated the interaction between Foxn1 and hypoxia-regulated factors. The Foxn1-/- mice displayed impairments in the regulation of Hif-1, Trx-1 and Fih-1 but not Arnt-2 during the healing process. An analysis of wounded skin showed that the skin of the Foxn1-/- mice healed in a scarless manner, displaying rapid re-epithelialization and an increase in transforming growth factor {beta} (Tgf{beta}-3) and collagen III expression. An in vitro analysis revealed that Foxn1 overexpression in keratinocytes isolated from the skin of the Foxn1-/- mice led to reduced Hif-1 expression in normoxic but not hypoxic cultures and inhibited Fih-1 expression exclusively under hypoxic conditions. These data indicate that in the skin, Foxn1 affects hypoxia-regulated factors that control the wound healing process and suggest that under normoxic conditions, Foxn1 is a limiting factor for Hif-1.",

Here, we compare the spatial autocorrelation of non-synonymous substitutions among species within diverse phylogenetic groups: Saccharomyces, Drosophila, Arabidopsis, and primates. Across these taxa, we find that amino acid substitutions exhibit excess clustering that extends over a 20-30 codon length (10-20 Angstrom distance) scale. We show that these substitutions cluster more strongly and exhibit compensatory dynamics within species lineages but exhibit patterns of convergent evolution between lineages. We evaluate a simple model of thermodynamic constraints on protein folding and conclude that it is unable to recapitulate the observed spatial clustering of substitutions. While pairs of substitutions with the strongest epistasis tend to spatially cluster in these simulations, the magnitude and length scale are smaller than that observed in real data. Additionally, we show that the pattern of convergent substitution is also not expected under this model, suggesting it is likely caused by factors other than these simple thermodynamic constraints. Our results support a prevalent role for epistasis and convergent evolution in shaping protein evolution across the tree of life.",

TK activity explains most features of CML, such as tumor development and maintenance. TK-inhibitory (TKI) drugs have changed its prognosis and natural history. Unfortunately, the ABL1 gene persists unaffected by TKIs, leukemic stem cells (LSCs) remains, resistant mutations arise and adverse effects may occur during treatment. To address this problem, we have designed a potential therapeutic alternative with CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing nucleases that target LSCs. The strategy was successfully developed in murine and human cell lines and finally was evaluated in primary LSCs isolated from CML transgenic mice and from CML patients. Mouse CML-LSCs edited were orthotopic transplanted in immunodeficient NSG niches where restored the normal hematopoiesis. Importantly, patient-derived xenografts with CD34+-LSCs edited, repopulated and restored the normal hematopoiesis in immunodeficient NSG niches. We show, for the first time, how CRISPR technology efficiently interrupts the BCR/ABL1 oncogene in murine and human LSCs to provide a significant therapeutic benefit. We propose human CML as a potential candidate for CRISPR therapy, providing proof-of-principle for genome editing in CML patients, and open new avenues for the application of this technique in other fusion genes.\n\nKey pointsCRISPR system destroys BCR/ABL oncogene and induces a therapeutic benefit in a CML mouse model and CML patient derived xenografts.",

    "abstract": "SNP heritability of a trait is measured by the proportion of total variance explained by the additive effects of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Linear mixed models are routinely used to estimate SNP heritability for many complex traits. The basic concept behind this approach is to model genetic contribution as a random effect, where the variance of this genetic contribution attributes to the heritability of the trait. This linear mixed model approach requires estimation of  relatedness among individuals in the sample, which is usually captured by estimating a genetic relationship matrix (GRM). Heritability is estimated by the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) or method of moments (MOM) approaches, and this estimation relies heavily on the GRM computed from the genetic data on individuals. Presence of population substructure in the data could significantly impact the GRM estimation and may introduce bias in heritability estimation. The common practice of accounting for such population substructure is to adjust for the top few principal components of the GRM as covariates in the linear mixed model. Here we propose an alternative way of estimating heritability in multi-ethnic studies. Our proposed approach is a MOM estimator derived from the Haseman-Elston regression and gives an asymptotically unbiased estimate of heritability in presence of population stratification. It introduces adjustments for the population stratification in a second-order estimating equation and allows for the total phenotypic variance vary by ethnicity. We study the performance of different MOM and REML approaches in presence of population stratification through extensive simulation studies. We estimate the heritability of height, weight and other anthropometric traits in the UK Biobank cohort to investigate the impact of subtle population substructure on SNP heritability estimation.",

    "abstract": "ARTICLECpG islands (CGIs) represent a distinctive and widespread genetic feature of vertebrate genomes, being associated with [~]70% of all annotated gene promoters1. CGIs have been proposed to control transcription initiation by conferring nearby promoters with unique chromatin properties2-4. In addition, there are thousands of distal or orphan CGIs (oCGIs) whose functional relevance and mechanism of action are barely known5-7. Here we show that oCGIs are an essential component of poised enhancers (PEs)8, 9 that boost their long-range regulatory activity and dictate the responsiveness of their target genes. Using a CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in strategy in mESC, we introduced PEs with or without oCGIs within topological associating domains (TADs) harbouring genes with different types of promoters. By evaluating the chromatin, topological and regulatory properties of the engineered PEs, we uncover that, rather than increasing their local activation, oCGIs boost the physical and functional communication between PEs and distally located developmental genes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that developmental genes with CpG rich promoters are particularly responsive to PEs and that such responsiveness depends on the presence of oCGIs. Therefore, our work unveils a novel role for CGIs as genetic determinants of the compatibility between genes and enhancers, thus providing major insights into how developmental gene expression programs are deployed under both physiological and pathological conditions10-12.",

    "abstract": "Precise genome editing is a valuable tool to study gene function in model organisms. Prime editing, a precise editing system developed in mammalian cells, does not require double strand breaks or donor DNA and has low off-target effects. Here, we applied prime editing for the model organism Drosophila melanogaster and developed conditions for optimal editing. By expressing prime editing components in cultured cells or somatic cells of transgenic flies, we precisely installed premature stop codons in three classical visible marker genes, ebony, white, and forked. Furthermore, by restricting editing to germ cells, we demonstrate efficient germ line transmission of a precise edit in ebony to ~50% of progeny. Our results suggest that prime editing is a useful system in Drosophila to study gene function, such as engineering precise point mutations, deletions, or epitope tags.",

    "abstract": "Boosting immune cell function by targeting the co-inhibitory receptor PD-1 may have applications in the treatment of chronic infections. Here we examine the role of PD-1 during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection of rhesus macaques. Animals treated with PD-1 mAb developed worse disease and higher granuloma bacterial loads compared to isotype control treated monkeys. PD-1 blockade increased the number and functionality of granuloma Mtb-specific CD8 T cells. In contrast, Mtb-specific CD4 T cells in PD-1 treated macaques were not increased in number or function in granulomas, upregulated high levels of CTLA-4 and exhibited reduced intralesional trafficking in live imaging studies. In granulomas of PD-1 treated animals, multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines were elevated, and more cytokines correlated with bacterial loads, leading to the identification of a role for caspase 1 in the exacerbation of tuberculosis after PD-1 blockade. Lastly, increased Mtb bacterial loads after PD-1 blockade were found to associate with the composition of the intestinal microbiota prior to infection in individual macaques. Therefore, PD-1-mediated co-inhibition is required for control of Mtb infection in macaques, perhaps due to its role in dampening detrimental inflammation as well as allowing for normal CD4 T cell responses.",

These ISGs require strict regulation for an efficient and controlled antiviral response, but post-transcriptional controls of these genes have not been well defined. Here, we identify a new role for the RNA base modification N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in the regulation of ISGs. Using ribosome profiling and quantitative mass spectrometry, coupled with m6A-immunoprecipitation and sequencing, we identified a subset of ISGs, including IFITM1, whose translation is enhanced by m6A and the m6A methyltransferase proteins METTL3 and METTL14. We further determined that the m6A reader YTHDF1 increases the expression of IFITM1 in an m6A binding-dependent manner. Importantly, we found that the m6A methyltransferase complex promotes the antiviral activity of type I IFN. Thus, these studies identify m6A as a post-transcriptional control of ISG translation during the type I IFN response for antiviral restriction.",

    "abstract": "Working memory (WM) is a fundamental construct of human cognition. The neural basis of auditory WM is thought to reflect a distributed brain network consisting of canonical memory and central executive brain regions including frontal lobe, prefrontal areas, and hippocampus. Yet, the role of auditory (sensory) cortex in supporting active memory representations remains controversial. Here, we recorded neuroelectric activity via EEG as listeners actively performed an auditory version of the Sternberg memory task. Memory load was taxed by parametrically manipulating the number of auditory tokens (letter sounds) held in memory. Source analysis of scalp potentials showed that sustained neural activity maintained in auditory cortex (AC) prior to memory retrieval closely scaled with behavioral performance. Brain-behavior correlations revealed lateralized modulations in left (but not right) AC predicted individual differences in auditory WM capacity. Our findings confirm a prominent role of auditory cortex, traditionally viewed as a sensory-perceptual processor, in actively maintaining memory traces and dictating individual differences in behavioral WM limits.",

The prevalent view on age-dependent increase in reactive astrogliosis and astrocytic hypertrophy requires scrutiny and detailed analysis. Using two-photon microscopy in conjunction with 3D reconstruction, Sholl and volume fraction analysis we demonstrate a significant reduction in the number and the length of astrocytic processes, in astrocytic territorial domains and in astrocyte-to-astrocyte coupling in the aged brain. Probing physiology of astrocytes with patch-clamp and Ca2+ imaging revealed deficits in K+ and glutamate clearance, and spatiotemporal reorganization of Ca2+ events in old astrocytes. These changes paralleled impaired synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal CA1 in old mice. Our findings may explain astroglial mechanisms of age-dependent decline in learning and memory.",

    "abstract": "The diverse cerebral consequences of preterm birth create significant challenges for understanding pathogenesis or predicting later outcome. Instead of focusing on describing effects common to the group, comparing individual infants against robust normative data offers a powerful alternative to study brain maturation. Here we used Gaussian process regression to create normative curves characterising brain volumetric development in 274 term-born infants, modelling for age at scan and sex. We then compared 89 preterm infants scanned at termequivalent age to these normative charts, relating individual deviations from typical volumetric development to perinatal risk factors and later neurocognitive scores. To test generalisability, we used a second independent dataset comprising of 253 preterm infants scanned using different acquisition parameters and scanner. We describe rapid, non-uniform brain growth during the neonatal period. In both preterm cohorts, cerebral atypicalities were widespread, often multiple, and varied highly between individuals. Deviations from normative development were associated with respiratory support, nutrition, birth weight, and later neurocognition, demonstrating their clinical relevance. Group-level understanding of the preterm brain disguise a large degree of individual differences. We provide a method and normative dataset that offer a more precise characterisation of the cerebral consequences of preterm birth by profiling the individual neonatal brain.",

    "abstract": "Congenital amusia is a life-long deficit of musical processing. This deficit can extend to the processing of language and in particular, emotional prosody. In a previous behavioral study, we revealed that while amusic individuals had difficulties in explicitly recognizing emotions for short vowels, they rated the emotional intensity of these same vowels as did their matched control participants. This finding led to the hypothesis that congenital amusics might be impaired for explicit emotional prosody recognition, but not for its implicit processing. With the aim to investigate amusics automatic processing of prosody, the present study measured electroencephalography (EEG) when participants listened passively to vowels presented within an oddball paradigm. Emotionally neutral vowel served as the standard and either emotional (anger and sadness) or neutral vowels as deviants. Evoked potentials were compared between participants with congenital amusia and control participants matched in age, education, and musical training. The MMN was rather preserved for all deviants in amusia, whereas an earlier negative component was found decreased in amplitude in amusics compared to controls for the neutral and sadness deviants. For the most salient deviant (anger), the P3a was decreased in amplitude for amusics compared to controls. These results showed some preserved automatic detection of emotional deviance in amusia despite an early deficit to process subtle acoustic changes. In addition, the automatic attentional shift in response to salient deviants at later processing stages was reduced in amusics in comparison to the controls. In the three ERPs related to the deviance, between-group differences were larger over bilateral prefrontal areas, previously shown to display functional impairments in congenital amusia. Our present study thus provides further understanding of the dichotomy between implicit and explicit processing in congenital amusia, in particular for vocal stimuli with emotional content.",

    "abstract": "Antibodies against A{beta} amyloid are indispensable research tools and potential therapeutics for Alzheimers Disease, but display several unusual properties, such as specificity for aggregated forms of the peptide, ability to distinguish polymorphic aggregate structures and ability to recognize generic aggregation-related epitopes formed by unrelated amyloid sequences. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these unusual properties of anti-amyloid antibodies and the structures of their corresponding epitopes is crucial for the understanding why antibodies display different therapeutic activities and for the development of more effective therapeutic agents. Here we employed a novel \"epitomic\" approach to map the fine structure of the epitopes of 28 monoclonal antibodies against amyloid-beta using immunoselection of random sequences from a phage display library, deep sequencing and pattern analysis to define the critical sequence elements recognized by the antibodies. Although most of the antibodies map to major linear epitopes in the amino terminal 1-14 residues of A{beta}, the antibodies display differences in the target sequence residues that are critical for binding and in their individual preferences for non-target residues, indicating that the antibodies bind to alternative conformations of the sequence by different mechanisms. Epitomic analysis also identifies more discontinuous, non-overlapping sequence A{beta} segments than peptide array approaches that may constitute the conformational epitopes that underlie the aggregation specificity of antibodies. Aggregation specific antibodies recognize sequences that display a significantly higher predicted propensity for forming amyloid than antibodies that recognize monomer, indicating that the ability of random sequences to aggregate into amyloid is a critical element of their binding mechanism.",

Analyses were carried out on the number of publications as (a) function of time (day), (b) journals and (c) authors. Doubling time of the number of publications was analyzed for PubMed \"all articles\" and Elsevier published articles. Analyzed databases were (1A) PubMed \"all articles\" (01/12/2019-12/06/2020) (1B) PubMed Review articles (01/12/2019-2/5/2020) and (1C) PubMed Clinical Trials (01/01/2020-30/06/2020) (2) Elsevier all publications (01/12/2019-25/05/2020) (3) RG (Article, Pre Print, Technical Report) (15/04/2020-30/4/2020).\n\nFindingsTotal publications in the observation period for PubMed, Elsevier, and RG were 23000, 5898 and 5393 respectively. The average number of publications/day for PubMed, Elsevier and RG were 70.0 {+/-}128.6, 77.6{+/-}125.3 and 255.6{+/-}205.8 respectively. PubMed shows an avalanche in the number of publication around May 10, number of publications jumped from 6.0{+/-}8.4/day to 282.5{+/-}110.3/day. The average doubling time for PubMed, Elsevier, and RG was 10.3{+/-}4 days, 20.6 days, and 2.3{+/-}2.0 days respectively. In PubMed average articles/journal was 5.2{+/-}10.3 and top 20 authors representing 935 articles are of Chinese descent. The average number of publications per author for PubMed, Elsevier, and RG was 1.2{+/-}1.4, 1.3{+/-}0.9, and 1.1{+/-}0.4 respectively. Subgroup analysis, PubMed review articles mean and median review time for each article were <0|17{+/-}17|77> and 13.9 days respectively; and reducing at a rate of-0.21 days (count)/day.\n\nInterpretationAlthough the disease has been known for around 6 months, the number of publications related to the Covid-19 until now is huge and growing very fast with time. It is essential to rationalize the publications scientifically by the researchers, authors, reviewers, and publishing houses.\n\nFundingNone",

While rare examples of dCas9 based tools for prokaryotes have been described, multiplexing approaches are limited due to the used effector nuclease.

Therefore, a previously described SoxS activator domain was linked to dCas12a to enable programmable activation of gene expression. Proof of principle of transcriptional regulation was demonstrated based on fluorescence reporter assays using the alternative host organism Paenibacillus polymyxa as well as Escherichia coli. Single target and multiplex CRISPR interference targeting the exopolysaccharide biosynthesis of P. polymyxa was shown to emulate polymer compositions of gene knock-outs. Simultaneous expression of 11 gRNAs targeting multiple lactate dehydrogenases and a butanediol dehydrogenase resulted in decreased lactate formation, as well as an increased butanediol production in microaerobic fermentation processes. Even though Cas12a is more restricted in terms of its genomic target sequences compared to Cas9, its ability to efficiently process its own guide RNAs in vivo makes it a promising tool to orchestrate sophisticated genetic reprogramming of bacterial cells or to screen for engineering targets in the genome. The developed tool will accelerate metabolic engineering efforts in the alternative host organism P. polymyxa and might be also applied for other bacterial cell factories.",

    "abstract": "Sex determination, the developmental process by which sexually dimorphic phenotypes are established, evolves fast. Species with polygenic sex determination, in which master regulatory genes are found on multiple different proto-sex chromosomes, are informative models to study the evolution of sex determination. House flies are such a model system, with male determining loci possible on all six chromosomes and a female-determiner on one of the chromosomes as well. The two most common male-determining proto-Y chromosomes form latitudinal clines on multiple continents, suggesting that temperature variation is an important selection pressure responsible for maintaining polygenic sex determination in this species. To identify candidate genes that may be under selection, we used RNA-seq to test for temperature-dependent effects of the proto-Y chromosomes on gene expression in adult house flies. We find no evidence for ecologically meaningful temperature-dependent expression of sex determining genes between male genotypes, but we were likely not sampling an appropriate developmental time-point to identify such effect. In contrast, we identified many other genes whose expression depends on the interaction between proto-Y chromosome genotype and temperature, including genes that encode proteins involved in reproduction, metabolism, lifespan, stress response, and immunity. Notably, genes with genotype-by-temperature interactions on expression are not enriched on the proto-sex chromosomes. Moreover, there is no evidence that temperature-dependent expression is driven by chromosome-wide expression divergence between the proto-Y and proto-X alleles. Therefore, if temperature-dependent gene expression is responsible for differences in phenotypes and fitness of proto-Y genotypes across house fly populations, these effects are driven by a small number of temperature-dependent alleles on the proto-Y chromosomes that may in turn affect the expression of genes on other chromosomes.",

This included conserved immunogenetic, structural and chemical solutions to epitope recognition and precise Env-amino acid substitutions, insertions and deletions leading to virus persistence. The structure of one rhesus antibody, capable of neutralizing 49% of a 208-strain panel, revealed a V2-apex mode of recognition like that of human bNAbs PGT145/PCT64-35M. Another rhesus antibody bound the CD4-binding site by CD4 mimicry mirroring human bNAbs 8ANC131/CH235/VRC01.

    "abstract": "Bacillus subtilis produces a wide range of secondary metabolites providing diverse plant-growth-promoting and biocontrol abilities. These secondary metabolites include non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs) with strong antimicrobial properties, causing either cell lysis, pore formation in fungal membranes, inhibition of certain enzymes, or bacterial protein synthesis. However, the natural products of B. subtilis are mostly studied either in laboratory strains or in individual isolates and therefore, a comparative overview of B. subtilis secondary metabolites is missing.\n\nIn this study, we have isolated 23 B. subtilis strains from eleven sampling sites, compared the fungal inhibition profiles of wild types and their NRPs mutants, followed the production of targeted lipopeptides, and determined the complete genomes of 13 soil isolates. We discovered that non-ribosomal peptide production varied among B. subtilis strains co-isolated from the same soil samples. In vitro antagonism assays revealed that biocontrol properties depend on the targeted plant pathogenic fungus and the tested B. subtilis isolate. While plipastatin alone is sufficient to inhibit Fusarium sp., a combination of plipastatin and surfactin is required to hinder the growth of Botrytis cinerea. Detailed genomic analysis revealed that altered NRP production profiles in certain isolates is due to missing core genes, nonsense mutation, or potentially altered gene regulation.\n\nOur study combines microbiological antagonism assays with chemical NRPs detection and biosynthetic gene cluster predictions in diverse B. subtilis soil isolates to provide a broader overview of the secondary metabolite chemodiversity of B. subtilis.\n\nIMPORTANCESecondary or specialized metabolites with antimicrobial activities define the biocontrol properties of microorganisms. Members of the Bacillus genus produce a plethora of secondary metabolites, of which non-ribosomally produced lipopeptides in particular display strong antifungal activity. To facilitate prediction of the biocontrol potential of new Bacillus subtilis isolates, we have explored the in vitro antifungal inhibitory profiles of recent B. subtilis isolates, combined with analytical natural product chemistry, mutational analysis, and detailed genome analysis of biosynthetic gene clusters. Such a comparative analysis helped to explain why selected B. subtilis isolates lack production of certain secondary metabolites.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput spatial-transcriptomics RNA sequencing (sptRNA-seq) based on in-situ capturing technologies has recently been developed to spatially resolve transcriptome-wide mRNA expressions mapped to the captured locations in a tissue sample. One major limitation of in-situ capturing is the high dropout rate of mRNAs that fail the capture or the amplification, which leads to incomplete profiling of the gene expressions. In this paper, we introduce a graph-regularized tensor completion model for imputing the missing mRNA expressions in sptRNA-seq data, namely FIST, Fast Imputation of Spatially-resolved transcriptomes by graph-regularized Tensor completion. We first model sptRNA-seq data as a 3-way sparse tensor in genes (p-mode) and the (x, y) spatial coordinates (x-mode and y-mode) of the observed gene expressions, and then consider the imputation of the unobserved entries as a tensor completion problem in Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) form. To improve the imputation of highly sparse sptRNA-seq data, we also introduce a protein-protein interaction network to add prior knowledge of gene functions, and a spatial graph to capture the the spatial relations among the capture spots. The tensor completion model is then regularized by a Cartesian product graph of protein-protein interaction network and the spatial graph to capture the high-order relations in the tensor. In the experiments, FIST was tested on ten 10x Genomics Visium spatial transcriptomic datasets of different tissue sections with cross-validation among the known entries in the imputation. FIST significantly outperformed several best performing single-cell RNAseq data imputation methods. We also demonstrate that both the spatial graph and PPI network play an important role in improving the imputation. In a case study, we further analyzed the gene clusters obtained from the imputed gene expressions to show that the imputations by FIST indeed capture the spatial characteristics in the gene expressions and reveal functions that are highly relevant to three different kinds of tissues in mouse kidney. The source code and data are available at https://github.com/kuanglab/FIST.\n\nAuthor summaryBiological tissues are composed of different types of structurally organized cell units playing distinct functional roles. The exciting new spatial gene expression profiling methods have enabled the analysis of spatially resolved transcriptomes to understand the spatial and functional characteristics of these cells in the context of eco-environment of tissue. Similar to single-cell RNA sequencing data, spatial transcriptomics data also suffers from a high dropout rate of mRNAs in in-situ capture. Our method, FIST (Fast Imputation of Spatially-resolved transcriptomes by graph-regularized Tensor completion), focuses on the spatial and high-sparsity nature of spatial transcriptomics data by modeling the data as a 3-way gene-by-(x, y)-location tensor and a product graph of a spatial graph and a protein-protein interaction network. Our comprehensive evaluation of FIST on ten 10x Genomics Visium spatial genomics datasets and comparison with the methods for single-cell RNA sequencing data imputation demonstrate that FIST is a better method more suitable for spatial gene expression imputation. Overall, we found FIST a useful new method for analyzing spatially resolved gene expressions based on novel modeling of spatial and functional information.",

    "abstract": "The production of itaconate by macrophages was only discovered in 2011. A rapidly increasing number of studies have since revealed essential biological roles for itaconate, ranging from antimicrobial to immunomodulator. Itaconate has been estimated to reach low-millimolar concentrations in activated macrophages, including those within infected lungs and brains, whereas itaconates MIC towards several bacterial strains were measured to be in the low-to-mid-millimolar range, casting some doubts on the antibacterial role of itaconate in vivo. Several of these investigations, in particular those measuring MIC values of itaconate or itaconic acid, have however tended to ignore the high acidity of this small diacid (pKas 3.85 and 5.45), thereby potentially biasing the MIC measurements. We report herein that: 1) at high concentration, itaconic acid can significantly reduce the pH of growth media; 2) the antibacterial activity of itaconate increases in a synergistic manner with acidity; 3) this synergistic effect is not simply due to increased permeability of monoanionic itaconate; 4) considering that the MIC of itaconate is many fold lower under acidic conditions for all strains tested, itaconate may serve an antimicrobial role, particularly in acidic vesicles such as the phagolysosome; and 5) differential growth behavior in the presence of disodium itaconate versus itaconic acid may serve to rapidly screen bacterial strains for their ability to metabolize itaconate. Our results further support the hypothesis that inhibitors of itaconate degradation in bacteria may provide a new strategy to treat infections.",

Depletion of LC3 exerts a profound inhibition on virus replication and egress. Here, we further characterize the role of LC3 in JEV replication, and through immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation show that LC3-I interacts with the virus capsid protein in infected cells. This association was observed on capsid localized to both the replication complex and lipid droplets (LDs). JEV infection decreased the number of LDs per cell indicating a link between lipid metabolism and virus replication. This capsid-LC3 interaction was independent of the autophagy adaptor protein p62/SQSTM1. Further, no association of capsid was seen with the GABARAP protein family, suggesting that this interaction was specific for LC3. High resolution protein-protein docking studies identified a putative LC3-interacting region (LIR) in capsid, 56FTAL59, and other key residues that could mediate a direct interaction between the two proteins.",

    "abstract": "Intertemporal choice requires choosing between a smaller reward available after a shorter time delay and a larger reward available after a longer time delay. Previous studies suggest that intertemporal preferences are formed by generating a subjective value of the monetary rewards that depends on reward amount and the associated time delay. Neuroimaging results indicate that this subjective value is tracked by ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and ventral striatum. Subsequently, an accumulation process, subserved by a network including dorsal medial frontal cortex (dmFC), dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and posterior parietal cortex (pPC), selects a choice based on the subjective values. The mechanisms of how value accumulation interacts with subjective valuation to make a choice, and how brain regions communicate during decision making are undetermined. We developed and performed an EEG experiment that parametrically manipulated the probability of preferring delayed larger rewards. A computational model equipped with time and reward information transformation, selective attention, and stochastic value accumulation mechanisms was constructed and fit to choice and response time data using a hierarchical Bayesian approach.\n\nPhase-based functional connectivity between putative dmFC and pPC was found to be associated with stimulus processing and to resemble the reconstructed accumulation dynamics from the best performing computational model across experimental conditions. By combining computational modeling and phase-based functional connectivity, our results suggest an association between value accumulation, choice competition, and frontoparietal connectivity in intertemporal choice.\n\nAuthor summaryIntertemporal choice is a prominent experimental assay for impulsivity. Behavior in the task involves several cognitive functions including valuation, action selection and self-control. It is unknown how these different functions are temporally implemented during the course of decision making. In the current study, we combined formal computational models of intertemporal choice with a phase-based EEG measure of activity across brain regions to show that functional connectivity between dmFC and pPC reflects cognitive mechanisms of both visual stimulus processing and choice value accumulation. The result supports the notion that dynamic interaction between frontopatietal regions instantiates the critical value accumulation process in intertemporal choice.",

Here, we tested the hypothesis that RPEs modulate declarative learning via theta-frequency oscillations, which have been related to memory encoding in prior work. For that purpose, we examined the interaction between RPE and transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) in declarative learning. Using a between-subject (real versus sham stimulation group), single-blind stimulation design, 76 participants learned 60 Dutch-Swahili word pairs, while theta-frequency (6 Hz) tACS was administered over the medial frontal cortex (MFC). Previous studies have implied MFC in memory encoding. We replicated our previous finding of signed RPEs (SRPEs) boosting declarative learning; with larger and more positive RPEs enhancing memory performance. However, tACS failed to modulate the SRPE effect in declarative learning and did not affect memory performance. Bayesian statistics supported evidence for an absence of effect. Our study confirms a role of RPE in declarative learning, but also calls for standardized procedures in transcranial electrical stimulation.",

    "abstract": "SARM1 is a central executor of axonal degeneration (1). Mechanistically, SARM1 contains NADase activity, which, in response to nerve injury, depletes the key cellular metabolite, NAD+ (2-5). Interestingly, SARM1 knockout mouse models do not present any apparent physiological impairment. Yet, the lack of SARM1 protects against various neuropathies (6, 7), thereby highlighting SARM1 as a likely safe and effective drug target (8). However, the absence of a SARM1 structure, in its active or inhibited form, makes it impossible to understand the molecular basis of SARM1 inhibition, and its activation under stress conditions. In this study we present two cryo-EM maps of SARM1 (at 2.6 [A] and 2.9 [A] resolution). We show that the inhibited SARM1 homo-octamer assumes a packed conformation with well-ordered inner and peripheral rings. Here the catalytic TIR domains are held apart from each other and are unable to form dimers, which is a prerequisite for NADase activity. More importantly, after screening several cellular metabolites we discovered that the inactive conformation is stabilized by the binding of SARM1s own substrate: NAD+. The NAD+ inhibitory allosteric site is located away from the NAD+ catalytic site of the TIR domain. Site-directed mutagenesis of the allosteric site leads to constitutive active SARM1. Based on our data we propose that a reduction of cellular NAD+ concentrations (an early indication of disease-associated and age-related neurodegeneration (9)) disassemble SARM1s peripheral ring, which allows NADase activity. This leads to an energetic catastrophe and eventually cell death. The discovery of the allosteric inhibitory site opens the door for the development of effective drugs that will prevent SARM1 activation, rather than compete for binding to the NADase catalytic site.\n\nBrief descriptionIt is not known how NAD+ depletion brings about neurodegeneration. Here, we show that the intrinsic NADase activity of SARM1 is allosterically inhibited by physiological concentrations of NAD+. NAD+ stabilizes a compact, auto-inhibited conformation of the SARM1 octamer. Once NAD+ levels are depleted, the allosteric inhibition is released, enabling SARM1s NADase activity, which eventually leads to energetic catastrophe and cell death.",

    "abstract": "Territorial defense involves frequent aggressive confrontations with competitors, but little is known about how brain-transcriptomic profiles change between individuals competing for territory establishment. Our previous study elucidated that brain-transcriptomic synchronization occurs in a pair-specific manner between two males of the fish Betta splendens during fighting, reflecting a mutual assessment process between them at the level of gene expression. Here we evaluated how the brain-transcriptomic profiles of opponents change immediately after shifting their social status (i.e., the winner/loser has emerged) and 30 min after this shift. We showed that unique and carryover hypotheses can be adapted to this system, in which changes in the expression of certain genes are unique to different fighting stages and in which the expression patterns of certain genes are transiently or persistently changed across all fighting stages. Interestingly, the specificity of the brain-transcriptomic synchronization of a pair during fighting was gradually lost after fighting ceased, because of the decrease in the variance in gene expression across all individuals, leading to the emergence of a basal neurogenomic state. Strikingly, this unique state was more basal than the state that existed in the before-fighting group and resulted in the reduced and consistent expression of genes across all individuals. In spite of the consistent and basal overall gene expression in each individual in this state, expression changes for genes related to metabolism, learning and memory, and autism still differentiated losers from winners. The fighting system using male B. splendens thus provides a promising platform for investigating neurogenomic states of aggression in vertebrates.\n\nAuthor summaryCompetitive interactions involve complex decision-making tasks that are shaped by mutual feedback between participants. When two animals interact, transcriptomes across their brains synchronize in a way that reflects how they assess and predict the others fighting ability and react to each others decisions. Here, we elucidated the gradual loss of brain-transcriptomic synchrony between interacting opponents after their interaction ceased, leading to the emergence of a basal neurogenomic state, in which the variations in gene expression were reduced to a minimum among all individuals. This basal neurogenomic state shares common characteristics with the hibernation state, which animals adopt to minimize their metabolic rates to cope with harsh environmental conditions. We demonstrated that this unique neurogenomic state, which is newly characterized in the present study, is composed of the expression of a unique set of genes, each of which was presumably minimally required for survival, providing a hypothesis that this state represents the smallest unit of neurogenomic activity for sustaining an active life.",

    "abstract": "Repeated interaction promotes cooperation among rational individuals under the shadow of future, but it is hard to maintain cooperation when a large number of error-prone individuals are involved. One way to construct a cooperative Nash equilibrium is to find a  friendly rivalry strategy, which aims at full cooperation but never allows the co-players to be better off. Recently it has been shown that for the iterated Prisoners Dilemma in the presence of error, a friendly rival can be designed with the following five rules: Cooperate if everyone did, accept punishment for your own mistake, punish defection, recover cooperation if you find a chance, and defect in all the other circumstances. In this work, we construct such a friendly-rivalry strategy for the iterated n-person public-goods game by generalizing those five rules. The resulting strategy makes a decision with referring to the previous m = 2n - 1 rounds. A friendly-rivalry strategy inherently has evolutionary robustness in the sense that no mutant strategy has higher fixation probability in this population than that of neutral drift, and our evolutionary simulation indeed shows excellent performance of the proposed strategy in a broad range of environmental conditions.\n\nAuthor summaryHow to maintain cooperation among a number of self-interested individuals is a difficult problem, especially if they can sometimes commit error. In this work, we propose a strategy for the iterated n-person public-goods game based on the following five rules: Cooperate if everyone did, accept punishment for your own mistake, punish others defection, recover cooperation if you find a chance, and defect in all the other circumstances. These rules are not far from actual human behavior, and the resulting strategy guarantees three advantages: First, if everyone uses it, full cooperation is recovered even if error occurs with small probability. Second, the player of this strategy always never obtains a lower long-term payoff than any of the co-players. Third, if the co-players are unconditional cooperators, it obtains a strictly higher long-term payoff than theirs. Therefore, if everyone uses this strategy, no one has a reason to change it. Furthermore, our simulation shows that this strategy will become highly abundant over long time scales due to its robustness against the invasion of other strategies. In this sense, the repeated social dilemma is solved for an arbitrary number of players.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetics is a reversible molecular mechanism that plays a critical role in many developmental, adaptive, and disease processes. DNA methylation has been shown to regulate gene expression and the advent of high throughput technologies has made genome-wide DNA methylation analysis possible. We investigated the effect of DNA methylation in eQTL mapping (methylation-adjusted eQTLs), by incorporating DNA methylation as a SNP-based covariate in eQTL mapping in African American derived hepatocytes. We found that the addition of DNA methylation uncovered new eQTLs and eGenes. Previously discovered eQTLs were significantly altered by the addition of DNA methylation data suggesting that methylation may modulate the association of SNPs to gene expression. We found that methylation-adjusted eQTLs which were less significant compared to PC-adjusted eQTLs were enriched in lipoprotein measurements (FDR = 0.0040), immune system disorders (FDR = 0.0042), and liver enzyme measurements (FDR = 0.047), suggesting a role of DNA methylation in regulating the genetic basis of these phenotypes. Our methylation-adjusted eQTL analysis also uncovered novel SNP-gene pairs. For example, our study found the SNP, rs11546996, was associated to PNKP. In a previous GWAS, this SNP was associated with primary biliary cirrhosis although the causal gene was thought to be SPIB. Our methylation-adjusted method potentially adds new understanding to the genetic basis of complex diseases that disproportionally affect African Americans.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of the anti-apoptotic BCL2 protein determines cell survival and is frequently abnormal in B cell lymphomas. An evolutionarily conserved post-translational mechanism for over-expression of BCL2 in human B cell lymphomas and the BCL2 paralogue CED-9 in Caenorhabditis elegans results from loss-of-function mutations in human FBXO10 and its C.elegans paralogue DRE-1, a BCL2/CED-9-binding subunit of the SKP-CULLIN-FBOX (SCF) ubiquitin ligase. Here, we tested the role of FBXO10 in BCL2 regulation by producing mice with two different CRISPR/Cas9-engineered Fbxo10 mutations: an Asp54Lys (E54K) missense mutation in the FBOX domain and a Cys55SerfsTer55 frameshift (fs) truncating mutation. Mice homozygous for either mutant allele were born at the expected Mendelian frequency and appeared normal in body weight and appearance as adults. Spleen B cells from homozygous mutant mice did not have increased BCL2 protein, nor were the numbers of mature B cells or germinal centre B cells increased as would be expected if BCL2 was increased. Other lymphocyte subsets that are also regulated by BCL2 levels also displayed no difference in frequency in homozygous Fbxo10 mutant mice. These results support one of two conclusions: either FBXO10 does not regulate BCL2 in mice, or it does so redundantly with other ubiquitin ligase complexes. Possible candidates for the latter include FBXO11 or ARTS-XIAP. The difference between the role of FBXO10 in regulating BCL2 protein levels in C. elegans and in human DLBCL, relative to single-gene deficient mouse leukocytes, should be further investigated.",

    "abstract": "The microbiome contributes to the development and maturation of the immune system1-3 In response to commensal bacteria, CD4+ T cells can differentiate into distinct functional subtypes with regulatory or effector functions along the intestine. Peripherally-induced Foxp3+-regulatory T cells (pTregs) maintain immune homeostasis at the intestinal mucosa by regulating effector T cell responses against dietary antigens and microbes4. Similarly to pTregs, a subset of small intestine intraepithelial lymphocytes CD4+CD8+ (CD4IELS) exhibit regulatory properties and promote tolerance against dietary antigens5. Development of CD4IELS from conventional CD4+ T cells or from Treg precursors depends on the microbiota5,6. However, the identity of the microbial antigens recognized by CD4IELs remains unknown. We identified species belonging to the Bacteroidetes phylum as commensal bacteria capable of generating CD4IEL from naive CD4+ T cells expressing the pTreg transnuclear (TN) monoclonal TCR6 as well as from polyclonal WT T cells. We found that {beta}-hexosaminidase, a widely conserved carbohydrate-metabolizing enzyme in the Bacteroidetes phylum, is recognized by TN T cells, which share their TCR specificity with CD4+ T cells found in the intraepithelial compartment of polyclonal specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice. In a mouse model of colitis, {beta}-hexosaminidase-specific CD4IELs provided protection from ulceration of the colon and weight loss. Thus, a single T cell clone can recognize a variety of abundant commensal bacteria and elicit a regulatory immune response at the intestinal epithelial surface.",
