    "abstract": "Orthologs diverge after lineage separation events and paralogs after gene duplications. Thus, orthologs are expected to remain more functionally coherent across lineages, while paralogs have been proposed as a source of new functions. Because protein functional divergence follows from non-synonymous substitutions, we performed an analysis based on the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS), as proxy for functional divergence. We used five working definitions of orthology, including reciprocal best hits (RBH), among other definitions based on network analyses and clustering. The results showed that orthologs, by all definitions tested, had values of dN/dS noticeably lower than those of paralogs, suggesting that, as a group, orthologs tend to be more functionally stable than paralogs. The differences in dN/dS ratios remained suggesting the functional stability of orthologs after eliminating gene comparisons with potential problems, such as genes with high codon usage biases, low coverage of either of the aligned sequences, or sequences with very high similarities. Separation by percent identity of the encoded proteins showed that the differences between the dN/dS ratios of orthologs and paralogs were more evident at high sequence identity, less so as identity dropped. While the last results partially explained the differences between dN/dS ratios of the two groups as being related to differences in protein identity, they also suggested that paralogs undergo functional divergence relatively early after duplication. Our analyses indicate that choosing orthologs as probably functionally coherent remains the right approach in comparative genomics.",

    "abstract": "Flagellar motility plays a central role in the bacterial foodborne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni, as flagellar motility is required for reaching the intestinal epithelium and subsequent colonisation or disease. Flagellar proteins also contribute strongly to biofilm formation during transmission. Chemotaxis is the process directing flagellar motility in response to attractant and repellent stimuli, but its role in biofilm formation of C. jejuni is not well understood. Here we show that inactivation of the core chemotaxis genes cheVAWY in C. jejuni strain NCTC 11168 affects both chemotactic motility and biofilm formation. Inactivation of any of the core chemotaxis genes (cheA, cheY, cheV or cheW) impaired chemotactic motility but did not affect flagellar assembly or growth. The {Delta}cheY mutant swam in clockwise loops, while complementation restored normal motility. Inactivation of the core chemotaxis genes interfered with the ability to form a discrete biofilm at the air-media interface, and the {Delta}cheY mutant displayed reduced dispersal/shedding of bacteria into the planktonic fraction. This suggests that while the chemotaxis system is not required for biofilm formation per se, it is necessary for organized biofilm formation. Hence interference with the Campylobacter chemotaxis system at any level disrupts optimal chemotactic motility and transmission modes such as biofilm formation.",

    "abstract": "Infamously, the presence of honest communication in a signaling environment may be difficult to reconcile with small (relative) signaling costs or a low degree of common interest between sender (beneficiary) and receiver (donor). This paper posits that one mechanism through which such communication can arise is through inattention on the part of the receiver, which allows for honest communication in settings where-should the receiver be fully attentive-honest communication would be impossible. We explore this idea through the Sir Philip Sidney game in detail and show that some degree of inattention is always weakly better for the receiver and may be strictly better. We compare limited attention to Lachmann and Bergstroms (1998) notion of a signaling medium and show that the receiver-optimal degree of inattention is equivalent to the receiver-optimal choice of medium.",

    "abstract": "Cryptic pockets are visible in ligand-bound protein structures but are occluded in unbound structures. Utilizing these pockets in fragment-based drug-design provides an attractive option for proteins not tractable by classical binding sites. However, owing to their hidden nature, they are difficult to identify. Here, we show that small glycols find cryptic pockets on diverse set of proteins. Initial crystallography experiments serendipitously revealed the ability of ethylene glycol, a small glycol, to identify a cryptic pocket on W6A mutant of RBSX protein (RBSX-W6A). Explicit-solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of RBSX-W6A with exposed-state of the cryptic pocket (ethylene glycol removed) revealed closure of the pocket reiterating that cryptic pockets in general prefer to stay in closed-state in absence of the ligands. Also, no change in the pocket was observed for simulations of RBSX-W6A with occluded-state of the cryptic pocket, suggesting that water molecules are not able to open the cryptic pocket. \"Cryptic-pocket finding\" potential of small glycols was then supported and generalized through additional crystallography experiments, explicit-cosolvent MD simulations, protein dataset construction and analysis. The cryptic pocket on RBSX-W6A was found again upon repeating the crystallography experiments with another small glycol, propylene glycol. Use of ethylene glycol as probe molecule in cosolvent MD simulations led to the enhanced sampling of the exposed-state of experimentally observed cryptic sites on test set of two proteins (Niemann-Pick C2, Interleukin-2). Further, analyses of protein structures with validated cryptic sites showed that ethylene glycol molecules binds to sites on proteins (G-actin, Myosin II, Bcl-xL, Glutamate receptor 2) which become apparent upon binding of biologically relevant ligands. Our study thus suggests potential application of the small glycols in experimental and computational fragment-based approaches to identify cryptic pockets in apparently undruggable and/or difficult targets, making these proteins amenable to drug-design strategies.",

    "abstract": "The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is a membrane-anchored tyrosine kinase that is able to selectively respond to multiple extra-cellular stimuli. Previous studies have indicated that the modularity of this system is affected by ligand-induced differences in the stability of the dimerized receptor in a process known as \"Biased signaling\". However, this hypothesis has not been explored using single-mutant ligands thus far. Herein, we developed a new approach to identify residues responsible for functional divergence combining the conservation and co-evolution information of ortholog and paralog genes encoding the epidermal growth factor (EGF) ligand. Then, we mutated these residues and assessed the mutants effects on the receptor by employing a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) and biochemical techniques. Although the EGF mutants had comparable binding affinities to the wild type ligand for EGFR, the EGF mutants induced a different phosphorylation and cell growth pattern in multiple cell lines. The MD simulations of the EGF mutants show a long-range effect on the receptor dimer interface. For the first time in this study, a single mutation in EGF is shown to be enough to alter the activation of the pathway at the cellular level. These results also support the theory of biased signaling in the tyrosine kinase receptor system and demonstrate a promising new way to study ligand-receptor interactions.",

Two experiments were conducted, in whose acquisition phase participants listened to five pairs of semantically unrelated words, each pair being repeated twenty times. In the test phase of Experiment 1, these \"old\" pairs were presented mixed with \"new\" pairs containing other words. In the test phase of Experiment 2, a third condition was added in which the first word in a pair was one of the words presented during acquisition but the second word was new. In both experiments, the second word in new word pairs elicited an N400 and a late (550-1000 ms) frontal positivity. The amplitude of the N400 to new second words in Experiment 2 was significantly larger when the first word in the pair was an old (previously learnt) word, as compared with the condition in which both first and second words were new. The results indicate that, in addition to a repetition effect, unintentional learning of word pairs results in building new associations between previously unrelated words.",

    "abstract": "Cancer genomes exhibit surprisingly weak signatures of negative selection1,2. This may be because selective pressures are relaxed or because genome-wide linkage prevents deleterious mutations from being removed (Hill-Robertson interference)3. By stratifying tumors by their genome-wide mutational burden, we observe negative selection (dN/dS ~ 0.47) in low mutational burden tumors, while remaining cancers exhibit dN/dS ratios ~1. This suggests that most tumors do not remove deleterious passengers. To buffer against deleterious passengers, tumors upregulate heat shock pathways as their mutational burden increases. Finally, evolutionary modeling finds that Hill-Robertson interference alone can reproduce patterns of attenuated selection and estimates the total fitness cost of passengers to be 40% per cell on average. Collectively, our findings suggest that the lack of observed negative selection in most tumors is not due to relaxed selective pressures, but rather the inability of selection to remove deleterious mutations in the presence of genome-wide linkage.",

    "abstract": "Replicability, the ability to replicate scientific findings, is a prerequisite for scientific discovery and clinical utility. Troublingly, we are in the midst of a replicability crisis. A key to replicability is that multiple measurements of the same item (e.g., experimental sample or clinical participant) under fixed experimental constraints are relatively similar to one another. Thus, statistics that quantify the relative contributions of accidental deviations--such as measurement error--as compared to systematic deviations--such as individual differences--are critical. We demonstrate that existing replicability statistics, such as intra-class correlation coefficient and fingerprinting, fail to adequately differentiate between accidental and systematic deviations in very simple settings. We therefore propose a novel statistic, discriminability, which quantifies the degree to which an individuals samples are relatively similar to one another, without restricting the data to be univariate, Gaussian, or even Euclidean. Using this statistic, we introduce the possibility of optimizing experimental design via increasing discriminability and prove that optimizing discriminability improves performance bounds in subsequent inference tasks. In extensive simulated and real datasets (focusing on brain imaging and demonstrating on genomics), only optimizing data discriminability improves performance on all subsequent inference tasks for each dataset. We therefore suggest that designing experiments and analyses to optimize discriminability may be a crucial step in solving the replicability crisis, and more generally, mitigating accidental measurement error.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn recent decades, the size and complexity of data has grown exponentially. Unfortunately, the increased scale of modern datasets brings many new challenges. At present, we are in the midst of a replicability crisis, in which scientific discoveries fail to replicate to new datasets. Difficulties in the measurement procedure and measurement processing pipelines coupled with the influx of complex high-resolution measurements, we believe, are at the core of the replicability crisis. If measurements themselves are not replicable, what hope can we have that we will be able to use the measurements for replicable scientific findings? We introduce the \"discriminability\" statistic, which quantifies how discriminable measurements are from one another, without limitations on the structure of the underlying measurements. We prove that discriminable strategies tend to be strategies which provide better accuracy on downstream scientific questions. We demonstrate the utility of discriminability over competing approaches in this context on two disparate datasets from both neuroimaging and genomics. Together, we believe these results suggest the value of designing experimental protocols and analysis procedures which optimize the discriminability.",

The Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) is an endeavor to generate 3-dimensional (3D) molecular atlases of healthy and diseased kidney biopsies using multiple state-of-the-art OMICS and imaging technologies across several institutions. Obtaining rigorous and reproducible results from disparate methods and at different sites to interrogate biomolecules at a single cell level or in 3D space is a significant challenge that can be a futile exercise if not well controlled. We describe a \"follow the tissue\" pipeline for generating a reliable and authentic single cell/region 3D molecular atlas of human adult kidney. Our approach emphasizes quality assurance, quality control, validation and harmonization across different OMICS and imaging technologies from sample procurement, processing, storage, shipping to data generation, analysis and sharing. We established benchmarks for quality control, rigor, reproducibility and feasibility across multiple technologies through a pilot experiment using common source tissue that was processed and analyzed at different institutions and different technologies. A peer review system was established to critically review quality control measures and the reproducibility of data generated by each technology before being approved to interrogate clinical biopsy specimens. The process established economizes the use of valuable biopsy tissue for multi-OMICS and imaging analysis with stringent quality control to ensure rigor and reproducibility of results and serves as a model for precision medicine projects across laboratories, institutions and consortia.",

We develop a mathematical model of the Lyme disease system to study the consequences of differential tick developmental-stage phenology for the transmission of B. burgdorferi. Incorporating seasonal tick activity can increase B. burgdorferi fitness compared to continuous tick activity but can also prevent transmission completely. B. burgdorferi fitness is greatest when the activity period of the infectious nymphal stage slightly precedes the larval activity period. Surprisingly, B. burgdorferi is eradicated if the larval activity period begins long after the end of nymphal activity due to a feedback with mouse population dynamics.

In this report, we introduced the VHP (Virus Host Prediction) to predict the potential hosts of viruses using deep learning algorithm. Our prediction suggests that 2019-nCoV has close infectivity with other human coronaviruses, especially the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Bat SARS-like Coronaviruses and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Based on our prediction, compared to the Coronaviruses infecting other vertebrates, bat coronaviruses are assigned with more similar infectivity patterns with 2019-nCoVs. Furthermore, by comparing the infectivity patterns of all viruses hosted on vertebrates, we found mink viruses show a closer infectivity pattern to 2019-nCov. These consequences of infectivity pattern analysis illustrate that bat and mink may be two candidate reservoirs of 2019-nCov.These results warn us to beware of 2019-nCoV and guide us to further explore the properties and reservoir of it.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryIt is of great value to identify whether a newly discovered virus has the risk of infecting human. Guo et al. proposed a virus host prediction method based on deep learning to detect what kind of host a virus can infect with DNA sequence as input.

We assessed pairwise classification accuracy at each time-point after stimulus onset, for individual infants and adults. Classification accuracies rose above chance in both groups, within 500 ms. In contrast to adults, neural representations in infants were not linearly separable across visual domains. Representations were similar within, but not across, age groups.

    "abstract": "The ability to express genes ectopically in bacteria is essential for diverse academic and industrial applications. Two major considerations when utilizing regulated promoter systems for ectopic gene expression are (1) the ability to titrate gene expression by addition of an exogenous inducer and (2) the leakiness of the promoter element in the absence of the inducer. Here, we describe a modular chromosomally integrated platform for ectopic gene expression in Vibrio cholerae. We compare the broadly used promoter elements Ptac and PBAD to versions that have an additional theophylline-responsive riboswitch (Ptac-riboswitch and PBAD-riboswitch). These constructs all exhibited unimodal titratable induction of gene expression, however, max induction varied with Ptac > PBAD > PBAD-riboswitch > Ptac-riboswitch. We also developed a sensitive reporter system to quantify promoter leakiness and show that leakiness for Ptac > Ptac-riboswitch > PBAD; while the newly developed PBAD-riboswitch exhibited no detectable leakiness. We demonstrate the utility of the tightly inducible PBAD-riboswitch construct using the dynamic activity of type IV competence pili in V. cholerae as a model system. The modular chromosomally integrated toolkit for ectopic gene expression described here should be valuable for the genetic study of Vibrio cholerae and could be adapted for use in other species.",

    "abstract": "How is the primary motor cortex (M1) organized to control fine finger movements? We investigated the population activity in M1 for single finger flexion and extension, using 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in female and male human participants, and compared these results to the neural spiking patterns recorded in two male monkeys performing the identical task. fMRI activity patterns were distinct for movements of different fingers, but quite similar for flexion and extension of the same finger. In contrast, spiking patterns in monkeys were quite distinct for both fingers and directions, similar to what was found for muscular activity patterns. The discrepancy between fMRI and electrophysiological measurements can be explained by two (non-mutually exclusive) characteristics of the organization of finger flexion and extension movements. Given that fMRI reflects predominantly input and recurrent activity, the results can be explained by an architecture in which neural populations that control flexion or extension of the same finger produce distinct outputs, but interact tightly with each other and receive similar inputs. Additionally, neurons tuned to different movement directions for the same finger (or combination of fingers) may cluster closely together, while neurons that control different finger combinations may be more spatially separated. When measuring this organization with fMRI at a coarse spatial scale, the activity patterns for flexion and extension of the same finger would appear very similar. Overall, we suggest that the discrepancy between fMRI and electrophysiological measurements provides new insights into the general organization of fine finger movements in M1.\n\nSignificance statementThe primary motor cortex (M1) is important for producing individuated finger movements. Recent evidence shows that movements that commonly co-occur are associated with more similar activity patterns in M1. Flexion and extension of the same finger, which never co-occur, should therefore be associated with distinct representations. However, using carefully controlled experiments and multivariate analyses, we demonstrate that human fMRI activity patterns for flexion or extension of the same finger are highly similar. In contrast, spiking patterns measured in monkey M1 are clearly distinct. This suggests that populations controlling opposite movements of the same finger, while producing distinct outputs, may cluster together and share inputs and local processing. These results provide testable hypotheses about the organization of hand control in M1.",

We identified RORB as a marker of selectively vulnerable excitatory neurons in the entorhinal cortex, and subsequently validated their depletion and selective susceptibility to neurofibrillary inclusions during disease progression using quantitative neuropathological methods. We also discovered an astrocyte subpopulation, likely representing reactive astrocytes, characterized by decreased expression of genes involved in homeostatic functions.

In sperm, a number of CTAs promote energy generation, however whether these proteins contribute to tumor cell metabolism is not understood. Here we describe COX6B2, a sperm-specific component of cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV). COX6B2 is frequently expressed in human lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and expression correlates with reduced survival time in patients. COX6B2, but not its somatic isoform COX6B1, enhances activity of complex IV, increasing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and NAD+ generation.\n\nConsequently, COX6B2-expressing cells display a proliferative advantage, particularly in low oxygen conditions. Conversely, depletion of COX6B2 attenuates OXPHOS and collapses mitochondrial membrane potential leading to cell death or senescence.\n\nFurthermore, COX6B2 is both necessary and sufficient for growth of tumors in vivo. Our findings reveal a previously unappreciated, tumor specific metabolic pathway hijacked from one of the most ATP-intensive processes in the animal kingdom: sperm motility.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral and central administration of glucose potently enhance cognitive functions. The present experiments examined changes in brain extracellular glucose levels while rats were trained to solve hippocampus-sensitive place or striatum-sensitive response learning tasks for food or water reward. During the first minutes of either place or response training, extracellular glucose levels declined in both the hippocampus and striatum, an effect not seen in untrained, rewarded rats. Subsequently, glucose increased in both brain areas under all training conditions, approaching asymptotic levels [~]15-25 min into training. Compared to untrained-food controls, training with food reward resulted in significant glucose increases in the hippocampus but not striatum; striatal glucose levels exhibited large increases to food intake in both trained and untrained groups. In rats trained to find water, glucose levels increased significantly above the values seen in untrained rats in both hippocampus and striatum. In contrast to results seen with lactate measurements, the magnitude of training-related increases in hippocampus and striatum glucose levels did not differ by task under either reward condition. The decreases in glucose early in training might reflect an increase in brain glucose consumption, perhaps triggering increased brain uptake of glucose from blood, as evident in the increases in glucose later in training. Together with past findings measuring lactate levels under the same conditions, the initial decreases in glucose may also stimulate increased production of lactate from astrocytes to support neural metabolism directly and/or to act as a signal to increase blood flow and glucose uptake into the brain.\n\nHighlightsO_LIGlucose levels in hippocampus and striatum decrease at the start of training.\nC_LIO_LIGlucose levels increase in both brain areas later in training.\nC_LIO_LIGlucose changes in both brain areas were similar for place and response tasks.\nC_LIO_LIGlucose levels responded similarly to training for either food and water rewards.\nC_LIO_LIEarly decreases in glucose may trigger increased production astrocytic lactate.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Ciona robusta (Ciona intestinalis type A), a model organism for biological studies, belongs to ascidians, the main class of tunicates, which are the closest relatives of vertebrates. In Ciona, a project on the ontology of both development and anatomy is ongoing for several years. Its goal is to standardize a resource relating each anatomical structure to developmental stages. Today, the ontology is codified until the hatching larva stage. Here, we present its extension throughout the swimming larva stages, the metamorphosis, until the juvenile stages. For standardizing the developmental ontology, we acquired different time-lapse movies, confocal microscope images and histological serial section images for each developmental event from the hatching larva stage (17.5 hour post fertilization) to the juvenile stage (7 days post fertilization). Combining these data, we defined 12 new distinct developmental stages (from Stage 26 to Stage 37), in addition to the previously defined 26 stages, referred to embryonic development. The new stages were grouped into four Periods named: Adhesion, Tail Absorption, Body Axis Rotation, and Juvenile. To build the anatomical ontology, 203 anatomical entities were identified, defined according to the literature, and annotated, taking advantage from the high resolution and the complementary information obtained from confocal microscopy and histology. The ontology describes the anatomical entities in hierarchical levels, from the cell level (cell lineage) to the tissue/organ level. Comparing the number of entities during development, we found two rounds on entity increase: in addition to the one occurring after fertilization, there is a second one during the Body Axis Rotation Period, when juvenile structures appear. Vice versa, one-third of anatomical entities associated with the embryo/larval life were significantly reduced at the beginning of metamorphosis. Data was finally integrated within the web-based resource \"TunicAnatO\", which includes a number of anatomical images and a dictionary with synonyms. This ontology will allow the standardization of data underpinning an accurate annotation of gene expression and the comprehension of mechanisms of differentiation. It will help in understanding the emergence of elaborated structures during both embryogenesis and metamorphosis, shedding light on tissue degeneration and differentiation occurring at metamorphosis.",

    "abstract": "Antigens displayed on self-assembling nanoparticles can stimulate strong immune responses and have been playing an increasingly prominent role in structure-based vaccines. However, the development of such immunogens is often complicated by inefficiencies in their production. To alleviate this issue, we developed a plug-and-play platform using the spontaneous isopeptide-bond formation of the SpyTag:SpyCatcher system to display trimeric antigens on self-assembling nanoparticles, including the 60-subunit Aquifex aeolicus lumazine synthase (LuS) and the 24-subunit Helicobacter pylori ferritin. LuS and ferritin coupled to SpyTag expressed well in a mammalian expression system when an N-linked glycan was added to the nanoparticle surface. The respiratory syncytial virus fusion (F) glycoprotein trimer - stabilized in the prefusion conformation and fused with SpyCatcher - could be efficiently conjugated to LuS-SpyTag or ferritin-SpyTag, enabling multivalent display of F trimers with prefusion antigenicity. Similarly, F-glycoprotein trimers from human parainfluenza virus-type 3 and spike-glycoprotein trimers from SARS-CoV-2 could be displayed on LuS nanoparticles with decent yield and antigenicity. Notably, murine vaccination with the SARS-CoV-2 spike-LuS nanoparticles elicited ~25-fold higher neutralizing responses, weight-per-weight relative to spike alone. The versatile platform described here thus allows for multivalent plug-and-play presentation on self-assembling nanoparticles of trimeric viral antigens, with SARS-CoV-2 spike-LuS nanoparticles inducing particularly potent neutralizing responses.",

    "abstract": "Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is known to be a factor in morbidity and mortality associated with acute viral infections including those caused by filoviruses and coronaviruses. IL-6 has been implicated as a cytokine negatively associated with survival after filovirus and coronavirus infection. However, IL-6 has also been shown to be an important mediator of innate immunity and important for the host response to an acute viral infection. Clinical studies are now being conducted by various researchers to evaluate the possible role of IL-6 blockers to improve outcomes in critically ill patients with CRS. Most of these studies involve the use of anti-IL-6R monoclonal antibodies (-IL-6R mAbs). We present data showing that direct neutralization of IL-6 with an -IL-6 mAb in a BALB/c Ebolavirus (EBOV) challenge model produced a statistically significant improvement in outcome compared with controls when administered within the first 24 hours of challenge and repeated every 72 hours. A similar effect was seen in mice treated with the same dose of -IL-6R mAb when the treatment was delayed 48 hrs post-challenge. These data suggest that direct neutralization of IL-6, early during the course of infection, may provide additional clinical benefits to IL-6 receptor blockade alone during treatment of patients with virus-induced CRS.",

To facilitate integration across data modalities and to accelerate the understanding of the functional logic of the fly brain, we developed an interactive computing environment called FlyBrainLab.\n\nFlyBrainLab is uniquely positioned to accelerate the discovery of the functional logic of the Drosophila brain. Its interactive open source architecture seamlessly integrates and brings together computational models with neuroanatomical, neurogenetic and electrophysiological data, changing the organization of neuroscientific fly brain data from a group of seemingly disparate databases, arrays and tables, to a well structured data and executable circuit repository.\n\nThe FlyBrainLab User Interface supports a highly intuitive and automated work-flow that streamlines the 3D exploration and visualization of fly brain circuits, and the interactive exploration of the functional logic of executable circuits created directly from the explored and visualized fly brain data. Furthermore, efficient comparisons of circuit models are supported, across models developed by different researchers, across different developmental stages of the fruit fly and across different datasets.\n\nThe FlyBrainLab Utility Libraries help untangle the graph structure of neural circuits from raw connectome and synaptome data. The Circuit Libraries facilitate the exploration of neural circuits of the neuropils of the central complex and, the development and implementation of models of the adult and larva fruit fly early olfactory systems.\n\nSeeking to transcend the limitations of the connectome, FlyBrainLab provides additional libraries for molecular transduction arising in sensory coding in vision and olfaction. Together with sensory neuron activity data, these libraries serve as entry points for discovering circuit function in the sensory systems of the fruit fly brain. They also enable the biological validation of developed executable circuits within the same platform.",

    "abstract": "Compared to the other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has a higher reproductive number that is driving the COVID-19 pandemic. The high transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been attributed to environmental, immunological, and molecular factors. The Spike protein is the foremost molecular factor responsible for virus fusion, entry and spread in the host, and thus holds clues for the rapid viral spread. The dense glycosylation of Spike, its high affinity of binding to the human ACE2 receptor, and the efficient priming by cleavage have already been proposed for driving efficient virus-host entry, but these do not explain its unusually high transmission rate. I have investigated the Spike from six {beta}-coronaviruses, including the SARS-CoV-2, and find that their surface-exposed fusion peptides constituting the defined fusion loop are spatially organized contiguous to each other to work synergistically for triggering the virus-host membrane fusion process. The architecture of the Spike quaternary structure ensures the participation of the fusion peptides in the initiation of the host membrane contact for the virus fusion process. The SARS-CoV-2 fusion peptides have unique physicochemical properties, accrued in part from the presence of consecutive prolines that impart backbone rigidity which aids the virus fusogenicity. The specific contribution of these prolines shows significantly diminished fusogenicity in vitro and associated pathogenesis in vivo, inferred from comparative studies of their deletion-mutant in a fellow murine {beta}-coronavirus MHV-A59. The priming of the Spike by its cleavage and subsequent fusogenic conformational transition steered by the fusion loop may be critical for the SARS-CoV-2 spread.\n\nSignificance StatementThe three proximal fusion peptides constituting the fusion loop in Spike protein are the membranotropic segments most suitable for engaging the host membrane surface for its disruption. Spikes unique quaternary structure architecture drives the fusion peptides to initiate the protein host membrane contact. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike trimer surface is relatively more hydrophobic among other human coronavirus Spikes, including the fusion peptides that are structurally more rigid owing to the presence of consecutive prolines, aromatic/hydrophobic clusters, a stretch of consecutive {beta}-branched amino acids, and the hydrogen bonds. The synergy accrued from the location of the fusion peptides, their physicochemical features, and the fusogenic conformational transition appears to drive the virus fusion process and may explain the high spread of the SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "SO_SCPLOWUMMARYC_SCPLOWMultivariate data are common in biological experiments and using the information on multiple traits is crucial to make better decisions for treatment recommendations or genotype selection. However, identifying genotypes/treatments that combine high performance across many traits has been a challenger task. Classical linear multi-trait selection indexes are available, but the presence of multicollinearity and the arbitrary choosing of weighting coefficients may erode the genetic gains. We propose a novel approach for genotype selection and treatment recommendation based on multiple traits that overcome the fragility of classical linear indexes. Here, we use the distance between the genotypes/treatment with an ideotype defined a priori as a multi-trait genotype-ideotype distance index (MGIDI) to provide a selection process that is unique, easy-to-interpret, free from weighting coefficients and multicollinearity issues. The performance of the MGIDI index is assessed through a Monte Carlo simulation study where the percentage of success in selecting traits with desired gains is compared with classical and modern indexes under different scenarios. Two real plant datasets are used to illustrate the application of the index from breeders and agronomists points of view. Our experimental results indicate that MGIDI can effectively select superior treatments/genotypes based on multi-trait data, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, and helping practitioners to make better strategic decisions towards an effective multivariate selection in biological experiments.",

Nanobodies are 12-15 kDa single-domain antibody fragments that are amenable to inexpensive large-scale production and can be delivered by inhalation. We have isolated nanobodies that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain and block spike protein interaction with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with 1-5 nM affinity. The lead nanobody candidate, NIH-CoVnb-112, blocks SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus infection of HEK293 cells expressing human ACE2 with an EC50 of 0.3 micrograms/mL. NIH-CoVnb-112 retains structural integrity and potency after nebulization. Furthermore, NIH-CoVnb-112 blocks interaction between ACE2 and several high affinity variant forms of the spike protein.

Such data presents a unique opportunity to study cell-cell interactions and the signaling genes that mediate them. However, most current methods for the analysis of this data focus on unsupervised descriptive modeling, making it hard to identify key signaling genes and quantitatively assess their impact.\n\nResultsWe developed a Mixture of Experts for Spatial Signaling genes Identification (MESSI) method to identify active signaling genes within and between cells. The mixture of experts strategy enables MESSI to subdivide cells into subtypes. MESSI relies on multi-task learning using information from neighboring cells to improve the prediction of response genes within a cell. Applying the methods to three spatial single cell expression datasets, we show that MESSI accurately predicts the levels of response genes, improving upon prior methods and provides useful biological insights about key signaling genes and subtypes of excitatory neuron cells.\n\nAvailabilityMESSI is available at: https://github.com/doraadong/MESSI\n\nContactzivbj@cs.cmu.edu",

    "abstract": "Protein thresholds have been shown to act as an ancient timekeeping device, such as in the time to lysis of E. coli infected with bacteriophage lambda. The time taken for protein levels to reach a particular threshold for the first time is defined as the first passage time of the protein synthesis system, which is a stochastic quantity. The first few moments of the distribution of first passage times were known earlier, but an analytical expression for the full distribution was not available. In this work, we derive an analytical expression for the first passage times for a long-lived protein. This expression allows us to calculate the full distribution not only for cases of no self-regulation, but also for both positive and negative self-regulation of the threshold protein. We show that the shape of the distribution matches previous experimental data on lambda-phage lysis time distributions. We also provide analytical expressions for the FPT distribution with non-zero degradation in Laplace space. Furthermore, we study the noise in the precision of the first passage times described by coefficient of variation (CV) of the distribution as a function of the protein threshold value. We show that under conditions of positive self-regulation, the CV declines monotonically with increasing protein threshold, while under conditions of linear negative self-regulation, there is an optimal protein threshold that minimizes the noise in the first passage times.",

    "abstract": "Chlorophyll (Chl) biosynthesis, crucial to life on Earth, is tightly regulated because its precursors are phototoxic1. In flowering plants, the enzyme Light-dependent Protochlorophyllide OxidoReductase (LPOR) captures photons to catalyze the penultimate reaction: the reduction of a double-bond within protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) to generate chlorophyllide (Chlide)2,3. In darkness, LPOR oligomerizes to facilitate photon energy transfer and catalysis4,5. However, the complete 3D structure of LPOR, the higher-order architecture of LPOR oligomers, and the implications of these self-assembled states for catalysis, including how LPOR positions Pchlide and the cofactor NADPH, remain unknown. Here we report the atomic structure of LPOR assemblies by electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM). LPOR polymerizes with its substrates into helical filaments around constricted lipid bilayer tubes. Portions of LPOR and Pchlide insert into the outer membrane leaflet, targeting the product, Chlide, to the membrane for the final reaction site of chlorophyll biosynthesis. In addition to its crucial photocatalytic role, we show that in darkness LPOR filaments directly shape membranes into high-curvature tubules with the spectral properties of the prolammelar body, whose light-triggered disassembly provides lipids for thylakoid assembly. Our structure of the catalytic site, moreover, challenges previously proposed reaction mechanisms6. Together, our results reveal a new and unexpected synergy between photosynthetic membrane biogenesis and chlorophyll synthesis in plants orchestrated by LPOR.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is the causative of the COVID-19 disease, which has spread pandemically around the globe within a few months. It is therefore necessary to collect fundamental information about the disease, its epidemiology and treatment, as well as about the virus itself. While the virus has been identified rapidly, detailed ultrastructural analysis of virus cell biology and architecture is still in its infancy. We therefore studied the virus morphology and morphometry of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV as it appears in Vero cell cultures by using conventional thin section electron microscopy and electron tomography. Both virus isolates, SARS-CoV Frankfurt 1 and SARS-CoV-2 Italy-INMI1, were virtually identical at the ultrastructural level and revealed a very similar particle size distribution with a median of about 100 nm without spikes. Maximal spike length of both viruses was 23 nm. The number of spikes per virus particle was about 30% higher in the SARS-CoV than in the SARS-CoV-2 isolate. This result complements a previous qualitative finding, which was related to a lower productivity of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture in comparison to SARS-CoV.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular Ca2+ level is under strict regulation through calcium channels and intracellular Ca2+ storage pools such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mutations in certain ion channel subunits, which result in the mis-regulation of Ca2+ influx, cause the excitotoxic necrosis of neurons. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, six mechanosensory (touch) neurons are induced to undergo excitotoxic necrosis by dominant mutations in the DEG/ENaC sodium channel subunits. These necrotic neurons are subsequently engulfed and degraded by neighboring hypodermal cells. We previously reported that the necrotic touch neurons actively expose phosphatidylserine (PS), an \"eat-me\" signal, to attract engulfing cells. However, the upstream signal that triggers PS externalization remained elusive. Here we report that a robust and transient increase of cytoplasmic Ca2+ level occurs prior to the exposure of PS on the surfaces of necrotic neurons. We further found that inhibiting the release of Ca2+ from the ER, either pharmacologically or genetically through mutations in the gene encoding calreticulin, the ER Ca2+ chaperon, impairs PS exposure on necrotic neurons. On the contrary, inhibiting the re-uptake of cytoplasmic Ca2+ into the ER induces ectopic necrosis and PS exposure. These findings indicate that high levels of cytoplasmic Ca2+ is necessary and sufficient for PS exposure. Remarkably, we found that PS exposure occurred independently of other necrosis events. On the other hand, apoptotic cells, unlike necrotic cells, do not depend on the ER Ca2+ pool for PS exposure. Our findings reveal a necrotic neuron-specific, \"two-step Ca2+-influx\" pathway that promotes PS exposure on cell surfaces. This pathway is initiated by the modest influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular space and further boosted by the release of Ca2+ from the ER into the cytoplasm.\n\nAuthor SummaryNecrosis is a type of cell death that exhibits distinct morphological features such as cell swelling. Many environmental insults induce cells to undergo necrosis. Necrotic cells expose phosphatidylserine (PS) - a type of phospholipid - on their outer surfaces. Receptor molecules on phagocytes detect phosphatidylserine on necrotic cells and subsequently initiate the engulfment process. As necrosis is associated with stroke, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, heart diseases, and inflammatory diseases, studying necrotic cell clearance has important medical relevance. In the model organism the nematode C. elegans, by utilizing dominant mutations in ion channels that induce neurons to undergo necrosis, we previously identified membrane proteins that promote the exposure of phosphatidylserine on necrotic cell surfaces. Here, using the same experimental system, we further discover that the necrosis insults trigger an increase of the cytoplasmic Ca2+ level, which in turn promotes PS externalization in necrotic cells. Furthermore, we find that the Ca2+ pool in the endoplasmic reticulum is necessary for the rapid increase of cytoplasmic Ca2+ that helps initiate necrosis. This Ca2+-regulated event is not observed when cells undergoing apoptosis (a form of cell suicide) expose PS. Our findings reveal a novel upstream regulatory mechanism that promotes necrotic cell clearance in animals.",

We show that larvae degrade the mucus layers to access epithelial cells. In early syncytial tunnels, larvae are completely intracellular but woven through multiple live enterocytes and goblet cells. We also use single cell RNA sequencing for the first time to describe the mouse caecum. From infected caeca, the transcriptome data reveal the progression of infection results in cell damage and an expansion of enterocytes with a type-I interferon (IFN) signature, characterised by the expression of Isg15, instigating the host immune response to the whipworm and tissue repair.

However, its physical origin and relationship to evolution of catalytic activity remain uncertain. Here, we show that directed evolution of a computationally designed Kemp eliminase introduces dynamical changes that give rise to an activation heat capacity absent in the original design3. Extensive molecular dynamics simulations show that evolution results in the closure of solvent exposed loops and better packing of the active site with transition state stabilising residues. Remarkably, these changes give rise to a correlated dynamical network involving the transition state and large parts of the protein. This network tightens the transition state ensemble, which induces an activation heat capacity and thereby nonlinearity in the temperature dependence. Our results have implications for understanding enzyme evolution (e.g. in explaining the role of distal mutations and evolutionary tuning of dynamical responses) and suggest that integrating dynamics with design and evolution will accelerate the development of efficient novel enzymes.",

    "abstract": "Heme-nitric oxide/oxygen binding (H-NOX) domains bind gaseous ligands for signal transduction in organisms spanning prokaryotic and eukaryotic kingdoms. In the bioluminescent marine bacterium Shewanella woodyi (Sw), H-NOX proteins regulate quorum sensing and biofilm formation. In higher animals, soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) binds nitric oxide with an H-NOX domain to induce cyclase activity and regulate vascular tone, wound healing and memory formation. sGC also binds stimulator compounds targeting cardiovascular disease. The molecular details of stimulator binding to sGC remain obscure but involve a binding pocket near an interface between H-NOX and coiled-coil domains. Here, we report the full NMR structure for CO-ligated Sw H-NOX in the presence and absence of stimulator compound IWP-051, and its backbone dynamics. Non-planar heme geometry was retained using a semi-empirical quantum potential energy approach. Although IWP-051 binding is weak, a single binding conformation was found at the interface of the two H-NOX subdomains. Binding lead to rotation of the subdomains and closure of the binding pocket. Backbone dynamics for the protein are similar across both domains except for two helix-connecting loops, which display increased dynamics that are further enhanced by compound binding. Structure-based sequence analyses indicate high sequence diversity in the binding pocket, but the pocket itself appears conserved among H-NOX proteins. The largest dynamical loop lies at the interface between Sw H-NOX and its binding partner as well as in the interface with the coiled coil in sGC, suggesting a critical role for the loop in signal transduction.",

    "abstract": "Currently, there is no effective treatment for placenta dysfunction in utero. In a ligated mouse model of fetal growth restriction (FGR), nanoparticle-mediated human insulin-like 1 growth factor (hIGF1) gene delivery (NP-Plac1-hIGF1) increased hIGF1 expression and maintained fetal growth. However, whether it can restore fetal growth remains to be determined. Using the endothelial nitric oxide synthase knockout (eNOS-/-) mouse model, a genetic model of FGR, we found that despite inducing expression of hIGF1 in the placentas treated with NP-Plac1-hIGF1 (P=0.0425), FGR did not resolve. This was associated with no change to the number of fetal capillaries in the placenta labyrinth; an outcome increased with NP-Plac1-hIGF1 treatment in the ligated mouse model, despite increased expression of angiopoietin 1 (P=0.05) and suggested IGF1 signaling in the placenta requires eNOS to modulate placenta angiogenesis. To further assess this hypothesis, we used the BeWo Choriocarcinoma cell line and human placenta explant cultures that were treated with NP-Plac1-hIGF1, oxidative stress was induced with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and NOS activity inhibited using the inhibitor L-NMMA. In both BeWo and explants, the protective effect of NP-Plac1-hIGF1 treatment against H2O2 induced cell death/lactate dehydrogenase release was prevented by eNOS inhibition (P=0.003 and P<0.0001, respectively). This was associated with an increase in mRNA expression of oxidative stress markers HIF1 (P<0.0001) and ADAM10 (P=0.0002) in the NP-Plac1-hIGF1+H2O2+L-NMMA treated BeWo cells. These findings show for the first time the requirement of eNOS/NOS in IGF1 signaling in placenta cells that may have implications for placental angiogenesis and fetal growth.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how genomic and expression variation is linked to adaptation of plants to local environments is fundamental to the fields of evolutionary biology and species conservation. Using locally adapted Arabidopsis thaliana Italy and Sweden populations, we examine how variation in gene expression under control and cold acclimation conditions, is linked to allele frequency differentiation (AFD); linkage disequilibrium (LD); selective constraint at nonsynonymous sites; and genetic-tradeoff quantitative trait loci (GT-QTL). Our results indicate that contrary to genes showing a main effect in environment (E), expression genotype by environment interactions (GxE) show significantly higher AFD along cis-regulatory and nonsynonymous sites than the neutral expectation; and interestingly, highly differentiated GxE genes show higher expression and inter-species selective constraint than the rest of the genes. When examining the association between genomic signatures of selection along GxE/E genes and GT-QTL, we find that GxE genes showing a high AFD and LD, display a significant and much higher enrichment along GT-QTL than the genome-wide/E set of genes. Nonetheless, E genes show a higher enrichment than the genome-wide control. In summary, our results suggest, that these highly expressed and selectively constrained GxE genes, may have been part of a cold-responsive regulon of E genes that experienced recent selection when migrating to new environments. Candidate GxE genes underlying GT-QTL reveal interesting biological processes that may underlie local adaptation to temperature, including flowering time, light-dependent cold acclimation, freezing tolerance, and response to hypoxia. Finally, we find no evidence linking lower expression of the CBF-dependent freezing tolerance pathway to genetic-tradeoffs and adaptation to warmer climates.",

    "abstract": "Humans rely on sweating to cool off and have the highest eccrine sweat gland density among mammals. We investigated whether altered regulation of the Engrailed 1 (EN1) gene, the levels of which are critical for patterning eccrine glands during development, could underlie the evolution of this defining human trait. First, we identify five EN1 candidate enhancers (ECEs) using comparative genomics and validation of enhancer activity in mouse skin. The human ortholog of one ECE, hECE18, contains multiple derived substitutions that together dramatically increase the activity of this enhancer in keratinocytes. Targeted repression of hECE18 reduces EN1 expression in human keratinocytes, indicating hECE18 upregulates EN1 in this context. Finally, we find that hECE18 increases ectodermal En1 in a humanized knock-in mouse to increase eccrine gland number. Our study uncovers a genetic basis for the evolution of one of the most singular human adaptations and implicates the recurrent mutation of a single enhancer as a novel mechanism for evolutionary change.",

    "abstract": "Visual perception remains stable across saccadic eye movements, despite the concurrent strongly disruptive visual flow. This stability is partially associated with a reduction in visual sensitivity, known as saccadic suppression, which already starts in the retina with reduced ganglion cell sensitivity. However, the retinal circuit mechanisms giving rise to such suppression remain unknown. Here, we describe these mechanisms using electrophysiology in mouse, pig, and macaque retina, 2-photon calcium imaging, computational modeling, and human psychophysics. We find that sequential stimuli, such as those that naturally occur during saccades, trigger three independent suppressive mechanisms in the retina. The main suppressive mechanism is triggered by contrast-reversing sequential stimuli and originates within the receptive field center of ganglion cells. It does not involve inhibition or other known suppressive mechanisms such as saturation or adaptation. Instead, it relies on temporal filtering of the inherently slow response of cone photoreceptors coupled with downstream nonlinearities. Two further mechanisms of suppression are present predominantly in ON ganglion cells and originate in the receptive field surround, highlighting a novel disparity between ON and OFF ganglion cells. The mechanisms uncovered here likely play a role in shaping the retinal output following eye movements and other natural viewing conditions where sequential stimulation is ubiquitous.",

The developmental increase was magnified in children and adults. There were systematic age-related differences in the probabilistic mappings between scalp locations and cortical ROIs.\n\nConclusionsOur findings have important implications in the design of sensor placement and making anatomical interpretations in NIRS and fNIRS research.

    "abstract": "Suppressing unwanted background sound is crucial for aural communication. A particularly disruptive type of background sound, informational masking (IM), often interferes in social settings. However, IM mechanisms are incompletely understood. At present, IM is identified operationally: when a target should be audible, based on suprathreshold target/masker energy ratios, yet cannot be heard because perceptually similar background sound interferes. Here, functional near infrared spectroscopy recordings show that task-evoked blood oxygenation changes near the superior temporal gyrus (STG) covary with behavioral speech detection performance for high-IM but not low-IM background sound, suggesting that the STG is part of an IM-dependent network. Moreover, listeners who are more vulnerable to IM show increased hemodynamic recruitment near STG. In contrast, task-evoked responses near another auditory region of cortex, the caudal inferior frontal sulcus (cIFS), do not predict behavioral sensitivity, suggesting that the cIFS belongs to an IM-independent network. Results are consistent with the idea that cortical gating shapes individual vulnerability to IM.",

    "abstract": "Sex is an important biological variable often used in analyzing and describing the functional organization of the brain during cognitive and behavioral tasks. Several prior studies have shown that blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) functional connectivity (FC) can be used to differentiate sex among individuals. Herein, we demonstrate that sex can be further classified with high accuracy using the intrinsic BOLD signal fluctuations from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). We adopted the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), and the fraction of ALFF (fALFF) features from the automated anatomical atlas (AAL) and Powers functional atlas as an input to different machine learning (ML) methods. Using datasets from five independently acquired subject cohorts and with eight fMRI scanning sessions, we comprehensively assessed unbiased performance using nested-cross validation for within-sample and across sample accuracies. The results demonstrated high prediction accuracies for the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset (area under cure (AUC) > 0.89). The yielded accuracies suggest that sex difference is embodied and well-pronounced in the low-frequency BOLD signal fluctuation. The performance degrades with the heterogeneity of the cohort and suggests that other factors.e.g. psychiatric disorders and demographics influences the BOLD signal and may interact with the classification of sex. In addition, the results revealed high learning generalizability with the HCP scan, but not across different datasets. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) across HCP scans showed moderate-to-good reliability based on atlas selection (ICC = 0.65 [0.63-0.67] and ICC= 0.78 [0.76-0.80].). We also assessed the effect of scan duration on the predictability of sex and showed that sex differences could be detected even with a short rs-fMRI scan (e.g., 2 minutes). Moreover, we provided statistical maps of the brain regions differentially recruited by or predicting sex using Shapely values and determined an overlap with previous reports of brain response due to sex differences. Altogether, our analysis suggests that sex differences are well-pronounced in rs-fMRI and should be considered seriously in any study design, analysis, or interpretation.",

Humans and other organisms utilize feedback between movement and sensing known as  sensorimotor coordination or  active perception to inform behaviour, but active perception has not before been investigated at a cellular level within organs. Here we provide the first proof of concept in silico/in vivo study demonstrating that filopodia (actin-rich, dynamic, finger like cell-membrane protrusions) play an unexpected role in speeding up collective endothelial decisions during the time-constrained process of  tip cell selection during blood vessel formation (angiogenesis).\n\nWe first validate simulation predictions in vivo with live imaging of zebrafish intersegmental vessel growth. Further simulation studies then indicate the effect is due to the coupled positive feedback between movement and sensing on filopodia conferring a bistable switch-like property to Notch lateral inhibition, ensuring tip selection is a rapid and robust process. We then employ measures from computational neuroscience to assess whether filopodia function as a primitive ( basal) form of active perception and find evidence in support. By viewing cell behaviour in tissues through the  basal cognitive lens we acquire a fresh perspective on not only the well-studied tip cell selection process, revealing a hidden, yet vital, time-keeping role for filopodia, but on how to interpret and understand cell behaviour in general, opening up a myriad of new and exciting research directions.",

Time-course imaging of a mCherry-sfGFP-PopZ fluorescent timer throughout the cell cycle revealed that existing PopZ resides at the old cell pole while newly translated PopZ accumulates at the new cell pole. Our studies suggest that interactions between PodJ and PopZ promotes the sequestration of older PopZ and robust accumulation of newl PopZ at the new cell pole. Elimination of the PodJ-PopZ interaction impacts PopZ client proteins, leading to chromosome segregation defects in one-third of cells. Additionally, this PopZ-PodJ interaction is crucial for anchoring PodJ and preventing PodJ extracellular loss at the old cell pole through unknown mechanism. Therefore, segregation of PopZ protein at the old pole and recruitment of newly translated PopZ at the new pole via the PodJ scaffold ensures stringent inheritance and maintenance of the polarity axis within dividing C. crescentus cells.",

    "abstract": "The causal genetic underpinnings of congenital heart diseases, which are often complex and with multigenic background, are still far from understood. Moreover, there are also predominantly monogenic heart defects, such as cardiomyopathies, with known disease genes for the majority of cases. In this study, we identified mutations in myomesin 2 (MYOM2) in patients with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), the most common cyanotic heart malformation, as well as in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), who do not exhibit any mutations in the known disease genes. MYOM2 is a major component of the myofibrillar M-band of the sarcomere and a hub gene within interactions of sarcomere genes. We show that patient-derived cardiomyocytes exhibit myofibrillar disarray and reduced passive force with increasing sarcomere lengths. Moreover, our comprehensive functional analyses in the Drosophila animal model reveal that the so far uncharacterized fly gene CG14964 may be an ortholog of MYOM2, as well as other myosin binding proteins (henceforth named as Drosophila Myomesin and Myosin Binding protein (dMnM)). Its partial loss-of-function or moderate cardiac knockdown results in cardiac dilation, whereas more severely reduced function causes a constricted phenotype and an increase in sarcomere myosin protein. Moreover, compound heterozygous combinations of CG14964 and the sarcomere gene Mhc (MYH6/7) exhibited synergistic genetic interactions. In summary, our results suggest that MYOM2 not only plays a critical role in maintaining robust heart function but may also be a candidate gene for heart diseases such as HCM and TOF, as it is clearly involved in the development of the heart.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTMYOM2 plays a critical role in establishing or maintaining robust heart function and is a candidate gene for heart diseases such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and Tetralogy of Fallot.",

    "abstract": "Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that make use of the host metabolic machineries to meet their biosynthetic needs, identifying the host pathways essential for the virus replication may lead to potential targets for therapeutic intervention. The mechanisms and pathways explored by SARS-CoV-2 to support its replication within host cells are not fully known. Lipid droplets (LD) are organelles with major functions in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis, and have multiple roles in infections and inflammation. Here we described that monocytes from COVID-19 patients have an increased LD accumulation compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative donors. In vitro, SARS-CoV-2 infection modulates pathways of lipid synthesis and uptake, including CD36, SREBP-1, PPAR{gamma} and DGAT-1 in monocytes and triggered LD formation in different human cells. LDs were found in close apposition with SARS-CoV-2 proteins and double-stranded (ds)-RNA in infected cells. Pharmacological modulation of LD formation by inhibition of DGAT-1 with A922500 significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication as well as reduced production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Taken together, we demonstrate the essential role of lipid metabolic reprograming and LD formation in SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis, opening new opportunities for therapeutic strategies to COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that emerged in 2019 and is now classified in the genus Coronavirus with closely related SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 is highly pathogenic in humans and is classified as a biosafety level (BSL)-3 pathogen, which makes manipulating it relatively difficult due to its infectious nature. To circumvent the need for BSL-3 laboratories, an alternative assay was developed that avoids live virus and instead uses a recombinant VSV expressing luciferase and possesses the full length or truncated spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, to measure SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies under BSL2 conditions, a chemiluminescence reduction neutralization test (CRNT) for SARS-CoV-2 was developed. The neutralization values of the serum samples collected from hospitalized patients with COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative donors against the pseudotyped virus infection evaluated by the CRNT were compared with antibody titers determined from an immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The CRNT, which used whole blood collected from hospitalized patients with COVID-19, was also examined. As a result, the inhibition of pseudotyped virus infection was specifically observed in both serum and whole blood and was also correlated with the results of the IFA. In conclusion, the CRNT for COVID-19 is a convenient assay system that can be performed in a BSL-2 laboratory with high specificity and sensitivity for evaluating the occurrence of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "A hallmark of aging is the inability of differentiated cells to maintain their identity. In the aged Drosophila midgut differentiated enterocytes (ECs) lose their identity, and the integrity of the midgut tissue and its homeostasis are impaired. To discover regulators of EC identity relevant to aging we performed an RNAi screen targeting 453 ubiquitin-related genes in fully differentiated ECs. Seventeen genes were identified, including the de-ubiquitinase Non-stop (Not/dUSP22; CG4166). Acute loss of Non-stop in young ECs phenotypically resembled aged ECs. Lineage tracing experiments established that Non-stop-deficient young ECs as well as wild-type aged ECs are no longer differentiated. Aging or acute loss of Non-stop also resulted in progenitor cell hyperproliferation and mis-differentiation, loss of gut integrity, and reduced organismal survival. Proteomic analysis unveiled that Non-stop maintains identity as part of a Non-stop identity complex (NIC) that contains E(y)2, Sgf11, Cp190, (Mod) mdg4, and Nup98. Transcriptionally, Non-stop ensured chromatin accessibility at EC genes, maintained an EC-specific gene expression signature, and silenced non-EC-relevant transcriptional programs. Within the NIC, Non-stop was required for stabilizing of NIC subunits. Upon aging, the levels of Non-stop and NIC subunits declined, and the large-scale organization of the nucleus was distorted. Maintaining youthful levels of Non-stop in wildtype aged ECs safeguarded the protein level of NIC subunits, restored the large-scale organization of the differentiated nucleus, and suppressed aging phenotypes and tissue integrity. Thus, the isopeptidase Non-stop, and NIC, supervise EC identity and protects from premature aging.",

    "abstract": "Membrane tension perceived by mechanosensitive (MS) proteins mediates cellular responses to mechanical stimuli and osmotic stresses, and it also guides multiple biological functions including cardiovascular control and development. In bacteria, MS channels function as tension-activated pores limiting excessive turgor pressure, with MscL (MS channel of large conductance) acting as an emergency release valve preventing cell lysis. Previous attempts to simulate gating transitions in MscL by either directly applying steering forces to the protein or by increasing the whole system tension were not fully successful and often disrupted the integrity of the system. We present a novel locally distributed tension molecular dynamics (LDT-MD) simulation method that allows application of forces continuously distributed among lipids surrounding the channel using a specially constructed collective variable. We report reproducible and reversible transitions of MscL to the open state with measured parameters of lateral expansion and conductivity that exactly satisfy experimental values. The LDT-MD method enables exploration of the MscL gating process with different pulling velocities and variable tension asymmetry between the inner and outer membrane leaflets. We use LDT-MD in combination with well-tempered metadynamics to reconstruct the tension-dependent free energy landscape for the opening transition in MscL.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEMembrane-embedded mechanosensitive (MS) proteins are essential for numerous biological functions including cardiovascular control and development, osmotic regulation, touch and pain sensing. In this work, we present a novel molecular dynamics simulation method that allows rapid and systematic exploration of structure, dynamics, and energetics of the mechanical transduction process in MS proteins under tightly controlled local tension distributed in the lipid rim around the protein. We provide a detailed description of the gating transition for the tension-activated bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance, MscL, which is the best characterized channel of this type. MscL functions as a tension-activated emergency osmolyte release valve that limits excessive turgor pressure, prevents cell lysis and thus imparts environmental stability to most free-living bacteria.",

Nuclear shape fluctuations depend on motor strength, crosslinking, and chromosome-lamina binding. Therefore, complex chromatin dynamics and nuclear shape emerge from a minimal, active chromosome-lamina system.",

    "abstract": "The N34S variant of the trypsin inhibitor SPINK1 is the clinically most significant risk factor for chronic pancreatitis, but the underlying molecular mechanism could not be identified. Molecular dynamics simulations and docking of the generated conformational ensemble of SPINK1 to trypsin show that the mutation reduces the fraction of conformations that can directly participate in productive association, thereby reducing the association rate. The small change is difficult to detect by measuring the kinetics of SPINK1 binding to trypsin. However, kinetic modeling reveals that even a small change in the inhibition rate affects the trypsinogen to trypsin conversion rate at the early stage of the reaction when the trypsin concentration is very low, and the impact is substantially amplified by the autocatalytic mechanism of the conversion. Thus, the slightly reduced inhibition rate shortens the delay in the activation of trypsin release, which is therefore occurs within the pancreas.",

Emap2sec+ employs the deep Residual convolutional neural network. Emap2sec+ assigns structural labels with associated probabilities at each voxel in a cryo-EM map, which will help structure modeling in an EM map.

We found that truncated receptors maintained the fundamental gating mechanism characteristic of NMDA receptors, which includes a multi-state activation sequence, desensitization steps, and mode transitions. This result establishes that none of the functionally-defined NMDA receptor activation events require the NTD. Notably, receptors that lacked the entire NTD layer retained isoform-specific kinetics. Together with previous reports, these results demonstrate that the entire gating machinery of NMDA receptors resides within a core domain that contains the ligand-binding and the channel-forming transmembrane domains, whereas the NTD and C-terminal layers serve modulatory functions, exclusively.",

    "abstract": "Ribosomopathies encompass a collection of human genetic disorders that often arise from mutations in ribosomal proteins or ribosome biogenesis factors. Despite ubiquitous requirement of ribosomes for protein synthesis, ribosomopathies present with tissue- and cell-type-specific disorders, and blood is particularly affected. Several ribosomopathies present with congenital anemias and bone marrow failure, and accordingly, erythroid lineage cells and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are preferentially impaired by ribosomal dysfunction. However, the factors that influence this cell-type-specific sensitivity are incompletely understood. Here, we show that protein synthesis rates change during HSC and erythroid progenitor ontogeny. Fetal HSCs exhibit significantly higher protein synthesis than adult HSCs. Despite protein synthesis differences, reconstituting activity of both fetal and adult HSCs is severely disrupted by a ribosomal mutation (Rpl24Bst/+). In contrast, fetal erythroid lineage progenitors exhibit significantly lower protein synthesis than their adult counterparts. Protein synthesis declines during erythroid differentiation, but the decline starts earlier in fetal differentiation than in adults. Strikingly, the Rpl24Bst/+ mutation impairs fetal, but not adult erythropoiesis, by impairing proliferation at fetal erythroid progenitor stages with the lowest protein synthesis relative to their adult counterparts. Thus, developmental and cell-type-specific changes in protein synthesis can sensitize hematopoietic cells to impaired ribosome biogenesis.\n\nKey PointsO_LIFetal HSCs synthesize much more protein per hour than young adult HSCs in vivo\nC_LIO_LIFetal erythroid progenitors synthesize much less protein per hour than young adult erythroid progenitors in vivo\nC_LIO_LIDifferences in protein synthesis dynamics distinguish fetal and adult erythroid differentiation\nC_LIO_LIA ribosomal mutation that reduces protein synthesis impairs fetal and adult HSCs\nC_LIO_LIReduced protein synthesis impairs fetal but not adult erythroid progenitors\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) from the cross-bridge is a pivotal step in the cross-bridge ATPase cycle leading to force generation. It is well known that Pi release and the force-generating step are reversible, thus increase of [Pi] decreases isometric force by product inhibition and increases the rate constant kTR of mechanically-induced force redevelopment due to the reversible redistribution of cross-bridges among non-force-generating and force-generating states. The experiments on cardiac myofibrils from guinea pig presented here show that increasing [Pi] increases kTR almost reciprocally to force, i.e., kTR {approx} 1/force. To elucidate which cross-bridge models can explain the reciprocal kTR-force relation, simulations were performed for models varying in sequence and kinetics of 1) the Pi release-rebinding equilibrium, 2) the force-generating step and its reversal, and 3) the transitions limiting forward and backward cycling of cross-bridges between non-force-generating and force-generating states. Models consisting of fast reversible force generation before/after rapid Pi release-rebinding fail to describe the kTR-force relation observed in experiments. Models consistent with the experimental kTR-force relation have in common that Pi binding and/or force-reversal are/is intrinsically slow, i.e., either Pi binding or force-reversal or both limit backward cycling of cross-bridges from force-generating to non-force-generating states.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEPrevious mechanical studies on muscle fibers, myofibrils and myosin interacting with actin revealed that force production associated to phosphate release from myosins active site presents a reversible process in the cross-bridge cycle. The correlation of this reversible process to the process(es) limiting kinetics of backward cycling from force-generating to non-force-generating states remained unclear.\n\nExperimental data of cardiac myofibrils and model simulations show that the combined effects of [Pi] on force and the rate constant of force redevelopment (kTR) are inconsistent with fast reversible force generation before/after rapid Pi release-rebinding. The minimum requirement in sequential models for successfully describing the experimentally observed nearly reciprocal change of force and kTR is that either the Pi binding or the force-reversal step limit backward cycling.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 90% of cancer related deaths can be attributed to a tumours ability to spread. We have identified CG7379, the fly orthologue of human ING1, as a potent invasion suppressor. ING1 is a type II tumour suppressor with well-established roles in the transcriptional regulation of genes that control cell proliferation, response to DNA damage, oncogene-induced senescence and apoptosis. Recent work suggests a possible role for ING1 in cancer cell invasion and metastasis, but the molecular mechanism underlying this observation is lacking. Our results show that reduced expression of CG7379 promotes invasion in vivo in Drosophila, reduces the junctional localisation of several adherens and septate junction components, and severely disrupts cell-cell junction architecture. Similarly, ING1 knockdown significantly enhances invasion in vitro and disrupts E-cadherin distribution at cell-cell junctions. A transcriptome analysis reveals that loss of ING1 affects the expression of several junctional and cytoskeletal modulators, confirming ING1 as an invasion suppressor and a key regulator of cell-cell junction integrity.",

    "abstract": "Maintenance of the pancreatic acinar cell phenotype suppresses tumor formation. Hence, repetitive acute or chronic pancreatitis, stress conditions in which the acinar cells dedifferentiate, predispose for cancer formation in the pancreas. Dedifferentiated acinar cells acquire a large panel of duct cell-specific markers. However, it remains unclear to what extent dedifferentiated acini differ from native duct cells and which genes are uniquely regulating acinar cell dedifferentiation. Moreover, most studies have been performed in mice since the availability of human cells is scarce.\n\nHere, we applied a non-genetic lineage tracing method of human pancreatic exocrine acinar and duct cells that allowed cell-type-specific gene expression profiling by RNA sequencing. Subsequent to this discovery analysis, one transcription factor that was unique for dedifferentiated acinar cells was functionally characterized.\n\nRNA sequencing analysis showed that human dedifferentiated acinar cells expressed genes in  Pathways of cancer with prominence of MECOM (EVI-1), a transcription factor that was not expressed by duct cells. During mouse embryonic development, pre-acinar cells also transiently expressed MECOM and in the adult mouse pancreas, MECOM was re-expressed when mice were subjected to acute and chronic pancreatitis, conditions in which acinar cells dedifferentiate. In human cells and in mice, MECOM expression correlated with and was directly regulated by SOX9. Mouse acinar cells that, by genetic manipulation, lose the ability to upregulate MECOM showed impaired cell adhesion, more prominent acinar cell death and suppressed acinar cell dedifferentiation by limited ERK signaling.\n\nIn conclusion, we transcriptionally profiled the two major human pancreatic exocrine cell types, acinar and duct cells, during experimental stress conditions. We provide insights that in dedifferentiated acinar cells, cancer pathways are upregulated in which MECOM is a critical regulator that suppresses acinar cell death by permitting cellular dedifferentiation.",

Here, we show that current tamoxifen use associated with larger breast adipocyte diameter only in women with a BMI >30 kg/m2. To understand the mechanisms behind these clinical findings, we investigated the impact of estrogen deprivation and tamoxifen in a relevant pre-clinical model of obesity. Specifically, mature female mice were housed at thermoneutrality and fed either a low-fat/low-sucrose (LFLS) or a high-fat/high-sucrose (HFHS) diet. Consistent with the high expression of Esr1 observed in single-cell RNA sequencing of mesenchymal stem cells from adipose tissue, endocrine therapies induced adipose accumulation and preadipocyte expansion, but resulted in adipocyte progenitor depletion only in the context of HFHS. Consequently, 7-week endocrine therapy supported adipocyte hypertrophy and was associated with hepatic steatosis, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance, particularly in HFHS fed females. Metformin or pioglitazone, glucose lowering drugs used to treat diabetes, prevented the effects of tamoxifen but not estrogen deprivation on adipocyte size and insulin resistance in HFHS-fed mice. This translational study suggests that endocrine therapies act via ER to directly disrupt adipocyte progenitors and support adipocyte hypertrophy, leading to ectopic lipid deposition that may promote hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Interventions that target insulin action should be considered for some women receiving life-saving endocrine therapies for breast cancer.",

In gynodioecious plants, it is especially important to understand whether females and hermaphrodites differ in their response to environmental stressors, as the fitness of females relative to hermaphrodites determines the extent to which these separate sexes are maintained in natural populations. Soil nutrient availability is of particular importance given the different nutrient requirements of male and female sexual functions in plants. Here, we evaluated and compared the growth of females and hermaphrodites of Geranium maculatum in response to varying levels of nutrients. Using a greenhouse experiment, we manipulated the overall nutrient, nitrogen, and phosphorus levels in the soil and measured growth, allocation, and leaf quality responses in both females and hermaphrodites. We found that sexes responded similarly in their growth and allocation responses to nutrient availability, albeit evidence that female leaf chlorophyll content may have increased more than that of hermaphrodites across soil nitrogen levels. Our findings demonstrate that hermaphrodites differ from females in terms of their physiological response to varying nutrient levels, however these physiological differences did not translate into meaningful growth or reproduction differences.",

In this study, we generated an in-vitro model for EEs, using the devastating WOREE syndrome as a prototype, by establishing brain organoids from CRISPR-engineered human ES cells and from patient-derived iPSCs. Using these models, we discovered dramatic cellular and molecular CNS abnormalities, including neural population changes, cortical differentiation malfunctions, and Wnt-pathway and DNA-damage response impairment. Furthermore, we provide a proof-of-concept that ectopic WWOX expression could potentially rescue these phenotypes. Our findings underscore the utility of modeling childhood epileptic encephalopathies using brain organoids and their use as a unique platform to test possible therapeutic intervention strategies.",

Here we used microbial bioparticles administered into the tumor microenvironment to transform neutrophils into anti-tumor effectors. Microbially activated neutrophils acquired an effector phenotype associated with pathogen killing and lost vascular endothelial growth factor expression associated with tumor growth and metastasis. They became the dominant immune cell infiltrating the tumor and inhibited tumor growth. Using intravital two-photon microscopy microbially activated neutrophils could be seen forming close contacts with tumor cells resulting in tumor tissue remodeling and tumor cell death. Thus, microbial bioparticle treatment can endow neutrophils with anti-tumor properties, suggesting that neutrophil plasticity in cancer could be exploited for tumor killing.

The unsupervised non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and nearest template prediction (NTP) algorithm was used to divide the patients to immune activated, immune exhausted and non-immune class. Verified gene sets of signatures were used to illustrate the characteristic of immunophenotypes. Clinical and genetic features were compared in different immunophenotypes.\n\nResultsWe identified the immune class and non-immune classes in from TCGA-BLCA cohort. The 150 top different expression genes between these two classes was extracted as the input profile for the reappearing of the classification in the other 19 cohorts. As to the activated and exhausted subgroups, a stromal activation signature was conducted by NTP algorithm. Patients in the immune classes shown the highly enriched signatures of immunocytes, while the exhausted subgroup also shown an increased signature of TITR, WNT/TGF-{beta}, TGF-{beta}1 activated, and C-ECM signatures. Patients in the immune activated shown a lower CNA burden, better overall survival, and favorable response to anti-PD-1 therapy.\n\nConclusionWe defined and validated a novel classifier among the 4003 bladder cancer patients. Anti-PD-1 immunotherapy could benefit more for the patients belong to immune activated subgroup, while ICB therapy plus TGF-{beta} inhibitor or EP300 inhibitor might be more effectiveness for patients in immune exhausted subgroup.",

The O-antigen is V. choleraes immunodominant antigen, and the two serotypes, which differ by the presence or absence of a terminally methylated O-antigen, likely influence development of immunity to cholera and oral cholera vaccines (OCVs). However, there is no consensus regarding the relative immunological potency of each serotype, in part because previous studies relied on genetically heterogenous strains. Here, we engineered matched serotype variants of a live OCV candidate, HaitiV, and used a germ-free mouse model to evaluate the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of each vaccine serotype. By combining vibriocidal antibody quantification with single and mixed strain infection assays, we found that all three HaitiV variants - InabaV, OgawaV, and HikoV (bivalent Inaba/Ogawa) - were immunogenic and protective, suggesting the impact of O1 serotype variation on OCV function may be minimal. The potency of OCVs was found to be challenge strain-dependent, emphasizing the importance of appropriate strain selection for cholera challenge studies. Our findings and experimental approaches will be valuable for guiding the development of live OCVs and oral vaccines for additional pathogens.",

In humans, infections with B. henselae can result in acute or chronic systemic infections with various clinical symptoms including local skin lesions, malaise, aches, chills, lymphadenopathy, endocarditis, or meningoencephalitis. The current treatment for Bartonella infections with antibiotics such as doxycycline and rifampin is not always effective presumably due to bacterial persistence. There have been various anecdotal reports of herbal extracts used for treating patients with persistent Bartonella infections but their activity on B. henselae is unknown. To test the potential antimicrobial activity of botanical or herbal medicines and develop better therapies for persistent Bartonella infections, in this study, we screened an herbal product collection against stationary phase B. henselae in vitro using SYBR Green I/ propidium iodide (PI) viability assay. These herbal medicines were selected by the fact that they are commonly used to treat Lyme and co-infections by patients and herbalists, and as a follow-up to our recent study where these herbs were tested against B. burgdorferi. We identified five herbal product extracts that had high activity against stationary phase B. henselae at 0.5% (v/v), including Cryptolepis sanguinolenta, Juglans nigra, Polygonum cuspidatum, Scutellaria baicalensis, and Scutellaria barbata. Among them, Cryptolepis sanguinolenta, Juglans nigra, and Polygonum cuspidatum could eradicate all stationary phase B. henselae cells within 7 days at 0.25% (v/v) in drug exposure time-kill assay, whereas Scutellaria baicalensis and Scutellaria barbata showed relatively poor activity. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination of these top hits indicated they were not only active against stationary phase non-growing B. henselae but also had good activity against log phase growing B. henselae.

Previous study has suggested that NLRP3 inflammasome plays a critical role in antifungal immunity.

We show that T. marneffei yeasts but not conidia induce potent IL-1{beta} response, which is differentially regulated in discrete immune cell types. Dectin-1/Syk signaling pathway mediates pro-IL-1{beta} production, and NLRP3 inflammasome is activated to trigger the processing of pro-IL-1{beta} into IL-1{beta}. The activated NLRP3 inflammasome partially promotes Th1 and Th17 immune responses against T. marneffei yeasts. In vivo, mice with NLRP3 or caspase-1 deficiency exhibit higher mortality rate and fungal load compared to wild-type mice.

    "abstract": "Untargeted sequencing of nucleic acids present in food can inform the detection of food safety and origin, as well as product tampering and mislabeling issues. The application of such technologies to food analysis could reveal valuable insights that are simply unobtainable by targeted testing, leading to the efforts of applying such technologies in the food industry. However, before these approaches can be applied, it is imperative to verify that the most appropriate methods are used at every step of the process: gathering primary material, laboratory methods, data analysis, and interpretation.\n\nThe focus of this study is in gathering the primary material, in this case, DNA. We used bovine milk as a model to 1) evaluate commercially available kits for their ability to extract nucleic acids from inoculated bovine milk; 2) evaluate host DNA depletion methods for use with milk, and 3) develop and evaluate a selective lysis-PMA based protocol for host DNA depletion in milk.\n\nOur results suggest that magnetic-based nucleic acid extraction methods are best for nucleic acid isolation of bovine milk. Removal of host DNA remains a challenge for untargeted sequencing of milk, highlighting that the individual matrix characteristics should always be considered in food testing. Some reported methods introduce bias against specific types of microbes, which may be particularly problematic in food safety where the detection of Gram-negative pathogens and indicators is essential. Continuous efforts are needed to develop and validate new approaches for untargeted metagenomics in samples with large amounts of DNA from a single host.\n\nImportanceTracking the bacterial communities present in our food has the potential to inform food safety and product origin. To do so, the entire genetic material present in a sample is extracted using chemical methods or commercially available kits and sequenced using next-generation platforms to provide a snapshot of what the relative composition looks like. Because the genetic material of higher organisms present in food (e.g., cow in milk or beef, wheat in flour) is around one thousand times larger than the bacterial content, challenges exist in gathering the information of interest. Additionally, specific bacterial characteristics can make them easier or harder to detect, adding another layer of complexity to this issue. In this study, we demonstrate the impact of using different methods in the ability of detecting specific bacteria and highlight the need to ensure that the most appropriate methods are being used for each particular sample.",

Nonetheless, the varying biochemical properties of sRNA, such as 5 nucleotide modifications, makes many sRNA subspecies incompatible with common protocols for sRNA sequencing. Here we describe 5XP-seq that outlines a novel strategy that solves this problem. By tagging 5P sRNA during library preparation, 5XP-seq combines an open approach that includes all types of 5-terminal modifications (5X), with a selective approach for 5-phosphorylated sRNA (5P). We show that 5XP-seq not only enriches phosphorylated miRNA and piRNA but successfully discriminates these sRNA from all other sRNA species. We further demonstrate the importance of this strategy by successful inter-species validation of sRNAs that would have otherwise failed, including human to insect translation of several tRNA (tRFs) and rRNA (rRFs) fragments. By combining 5 insensitive library strategies with 5 sensitive tagging, we have solved an intrinsic bias in modern sRNA sequencing that will help us reveal the true complexity and the evolutionary significance of the sRNA world.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCurrent mark release recapture methodologies are limited in their ability to address complex problems in vector biology, such as studying multiple groups overlapping in space and time. Additionally, limited mark retention, reduced post-marking survival, and the large effort in marking, collection and recapture, all complicate effective insect tracking.\n\nMethodWe have developed and evaluated a marking method using a fluorescent dye (Smartwater(R)) combined with synthetic DNA tags to informatively and efficiently mark adult mosquitoes using an airbrush pump and nebulizer. Using handheld UV flashlights, the fluorescent marking enabled quick and simple initial detection of recaptures in a simple, field-ready, and non-destructive approach that when combined with a simple, extraction-free PCR on individual mosquito legs provides potentially unlimited marking information.\n\nResultsThis marking, first tested in the laboratory with Anopheles gambiae s.l. mosquitoes, did not affect survival (median ages 24-28 days, p-adj > 0.25), oviposition (median eggs/female of 28.8, 32.5, 33.3 for water, green, red dyes, respectively, p-adj > 0.44), or Plasmodium competence (mean oocysts 5.56 to 10.6, p-adj > 0.95). DNA and fluorescence had 100% retention up to 3 weeks (longest time point tested) with high intensity, indicating marks would persist longer.\n\nConclusionsWe describe a novel, simple, no/low-impact, and long-lasting marking method that allows separation of multiple insect subpopulations by combining unlimited length and sequence variation in the synthetic DNA tags. This method can be readily deployed in the field for marking multiple groups of mosquitoes or other insects.",

    "abstract": "Resurrection studies are a useful tool to measure how phenotypic traits have changed in populations through time. If these traits modifications correlate with the environmental changes that occurred during the time period, it suggests that the phenotypic changes could be a response to selection. Selfing, through its reduction of effective size, could challenge the ability of a population to adapt to environmental changes. Here, we used a resurrection study to test for adaptation in a selfing population of Medicago truncatula, by comparing the genetic composition and flowering times across 22 generations. We found evidence for evolution towards earlier flowering times by about two days and a peculiar genetic structure, typical of highly selfing populations, where some multilocus genotypes (MLGs) are persistent through time. We used the change in frequency of the MLGs through time as a multilocus fitness measure and built a selection gradient that suggests evolution towards earlier flowering times. Yet, a simulation model revealed that the observed change in flowering time could be explained by drift alone, provided the effective size of the population is small enough (<150). These analyses suffer from the difficulty to estimate the effective size in a highly selfing population, where effective recombination is severely reduced.",

    "abstract": "Target enrichment is becoming increasingly popular for phylogenomic studies. Although baits for enrichment are typically designed to target single-copy genes, paralogs are often recovered with increased sequencing depth, sometimes from a significant proportion of loci, especially in groups experiencing whole-genome duplication (WGD) events. Common approaches for processing paralogs in target enrichment datasets include random selection, manual pruning, and mainly, the removal of entire genes that show any evidence of paralogy. These approaches are prone to errors in orthology inference or removing large numbers of genes. By removing entire genes, valuable information that could be used to detect and place WGD events is discarded. Here we use an automated approach for orthology inference in a target enrichment dataset of 68 species of Alchemilla s.l. (Rosaceae), a widely distributed clade of plants primarily from temperate climate regions. Previous molecular phylogenetic studies and chromosome numbers both suggested ancient WGDs in the group. However, both the phylogenetic location and putative parental lineages of these WGD events remain unknown. By taking paralogs into consideration, we identified four nodes in the backbone of Alchemilla s.l. with an elevated proportion of gene duplication. Furthermore, using a gene-tree reconciliation approach we established the autopolyploid origin of the entire Alchemilla s.l. and the nested allopolyploid origin of four major clades within the group. Here we showed the utility of automated tree-based orthology inference methods, previously designed for genomic or transcriptomic datasets, to study complex scenarios of polyploidy and reticulate evolution from target enrichment datasets.",

    "abstract": "Double-strand (ds)DNA formation and dissociation are of fundamental biological importance. The negatively DNA charge influences the dsDNA stability. However, the base pairing and the stacking between neighboring bases are responsible for the sequence dependent stability of dsDNA. The stability of a dsDNA molecule can be estimated from empirical nearest-neighbor models based on contributions assigned to base pair steps along the DNA and additional parameters due to DNA termini. In efforts to separate contributions it has been concluded that base-stacking dominates dsDNA stability whereas base-pairing contributes negligibly. Using a different model for dsDNA formation we re-analyze dsDNA stability contributions and conclude that base stacking contributes already at the level of separate ssDNAs but that pairing contributions drive the dsDNA formation. The theoretical model also predicts that stability contributions of base pair steps that contain only guanine/cytosine, mixed steps and steps with only adenine/thymine follows the order 6:5:4, respectively, as expected based on the formed hydrogen bonds. The model is fully consistent with available stacking data and nearest-neighbor dsDNA parameters. It allows to assign a narrowly distributed value for the effective free energy contribution per formed hydrogen bond during dsDNA formation of -0.72 kcal{middle dot}mol-1 based entirely on experimental data.",

    "abstract": "Uveal melanoma (UM) is a rare, but often lethal, form of ocular cancer arising from melanocytes within the uveal tract. UM has a high propensity to spread hematogenously to the liver, with up to 50% of patients developing liver metastases. Unfortunately, once liver metastasis occurs, patient prognosis is extremely poor with as few as 8% of patients surviving beyond two years. There are no standard-of-care therapies available for the treatment of metastatic uveal melanoma, hence it is a clinical area of urgent unmet need. Here, the clinical relevance and therapeutic potential of cysteinyl leukotriene receptors (CysLT1 and CysLT2) in UM was evaluated. High expression of CYSLTR1 or CYSLTR2 transcripts is significantly associated with poor disease-free survival and poor overall survival in UM patients. Digital pathology analysis identified high expression of CysLT1 in primary UM is associated with reduced disease-specific survival (p = 0.012) and overall survival (p = 0.011). High CysLT1 expression shows a statistically significant (p = 0.041) correlation with ciliary body involvement, a poor prognostic indicator in UM. Small molecule drugs targeting CysLT1 were vastly superior at exerting anti-cancer phenotypes in UM cell lines and zebrafish xenografts than drugs targeting CysLT2. Quininib, a selective CysLT1 antagonist, significantly inhibits survival (p < 0.0001), long-term proliferation (p < 0.0001), and oxidative phosphorylation (p < 0.001), but not glycolysis, in primary and metastatic UM cell lines. Quininib exerts opposing effects on the secretion of inflammatory markers in primary versus metastatic UM cell lines. Quininib significantly downregulated IL-2 and IL-6 in Mel285 cells (p < 0.05), but significantly upregulated IL-10, IL-1{beta}, IL-2 (p < 0.0001), IL-13, IL-8 (p < 0.001), IL-12p70 and IL-6 (p < 0.05) in OMM2.5 cells. Finally, quininib significantly inhibits tumour growth in orthotopic zebrafish xenograft models of UM. These preclinical data suggest that antagonism of CysLT1, but not CysLT2, may be of therapeutic interest in the treatment of UM.",

    "abstract": "Reproducibility and consistency are hallmarks of scientific integrity. Biological systems are inherently noisy, posing a challenge to reproducibility. This is particularly relevant to the field of environmental toxicology, where many unaccounted experimental parameters can have a marked influence on the biological response to exposure. Here, we extend the use of zebrafish as a robust toxicological model for studying the effects of inorganic arsenic (iAs) on liver biology. We observed that iAs toxicity in this system is not influenced by important parameters including genetic background, rearing container material or rearing volume but the dose response to iAs is influenced by the rearing medium. We compared mortality as a measure of iAs toxicity to embryos cultured in two standard rearing media: egg water made from dehydrated ocean salts dissolved in water and a defined embryo medium which is a pH adjusted, buffered salt solution. Larvae reared in egg water were more susceptible to iAs compared to those reared in embryo medium. This effect was independent of the pH differences between these solutions. These culture conditions did not cause any difference in the global hepatic transcriptome of control zebrafish. Further, no difference in the expression of genes involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR) in larvae exposed to iAs treatment or in a stress independent system to activate UPR genes by transgenic overexpression of activating transcription factor 6 (nAtf6) in hepatocytes was observed. However, the clutch-to-clutch variation in gene expression was significantly greater in larvae reared in egg water compared to those in embryo medium. These data demonstrate that egg water affects reproducibility across replicates in terms of gene expression and exacerbates iAs mediated toxic response. This highlights the importance of rigorous evaluation of experimental conditions to assure reproducibility.",

Brassinosteroids (BRs) are growth-promoting steroid hormones with vital roles in many root developmental processes. Sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) is a root crop with a tertiary root structure. The differentiation of vascular bundles and division of cambial cells increases root diameter. However, little is known about how BRs regulate the transverse growth of beetroot. Therefore, sugar beet with eight leaves was grown in medium containing epibrassinolide or brassinazole, an inhibitor of brassinosteroid biosynthesis. BRs increased the spacing between the cambial rings by increasing the size of parenchyma cells between the rings and ultimately increasing root diameter. BRs also promoted secondary xylem differentiation. These findings indicate that brassinosteroids function in transverse development in beetroot.",

The single chromosome strain exhibited a longer lag phase, increased doubling time, and lower final biomass concentration compared with a wildtype strain when grown on YPD. These phenotypes were amplified when ethanol was added to the medium or used as the sole carbon source. RNAseq analysis showed diminished induction of genes involved in diauxic shift, ethanol metabolism, fatty-acid {beta}-oxidation, and methylglyoxal catabolism during growth on ethanol compared to the reference strain. Enzyme-constrained metabolic modeling predicted that decreased flux through these poorly induced enzymes results in diminished ATP formation and decreased biomass accumulation observed.

Antibodies to Tula hantavirus, typical for Microtus voles, are known to cross-react strongly with the PUUV antigen used in PUUV screening, but we detected only one PUUV/TULV cross-reaction in Microtus arvalis (1.3% [0.1-7.9]).

We used samples from cohabiting Ruddy Turnstones (Arenaria interpres) across three age groups, collected at two contrasting points in their annual migratory cycle. Overall, we identified 14 viruses that likely infect birds, 11 of which were novel, including members of the Reoviridae, Astroviridae, Picornaviridae, and Phenuiviridae. Strikingly, 12 of the viruses identified were from juvenile birds sampled in the first year of their life, compared to only two viruses in adult birds. Similarly, both viral abundance and alpha diversity were higher in juvenile than adult birds. Notably, time of sampling had no association with virome structure such that the migratory period may not play a major role in structuring avian viromes. As well as informing studies of virus ecology, that host age impacts viral assemblages is a critical consideration for the future surveillance of novel and emerging viruses.",

    "abstract": "Produced Water (PW) from oil and gas (O&G) producing wells is a unique source of water in water-stressed regions. Microbiota within O&G formations have been well-studied on site/in-situ, but few applied works have considered their role in the treatment of PW in engineered water treatment systems. Herein, we operated a simple aeration/mixing bench-scale bioreactor fed with produced water under three conditions: 1) PW alone (control; hereafter referred to as  baseline), 2) phosphorous dosed daily as KH2PO4, and 3) activated sludge (AS) dosed daily from a sequence batch membrane bioreactor (SB-MBR). Aerated and mixed PW alone (baseline) was able to attenuate PW chemistry with removal of soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD) and ammonia by 27.6% and 17.8%, respectively. Further KH2PO4 and AS additions improved water treatment efficiency markedly; in the KH2PO4 addition reactor, sCOD and ammonia were reduced by 50.0% and 61.5%, respectively, and in the AS addition reactor by 52.5% and 59.2%, respectively. Microbial consortia determined via 16S rRNA gene amplicons differ in composition between raw PW and all reactors; order Kiloniellales was most common in raw PW while orders Rhodobacterales, Pseudomonadales, and Caulobacterales were most abundant amongst AS, KH2PO4, and baseline conditions, respectively. Several different microbial consortia are capable of treating raw PW which suggests that functional redundancy amongst microbiota in engineered treatment systems may be underappreciated. With simple addition of phosphorous and/or activated sludge to PW as part of a treatment strategy, a higher quality water can then be subjected to conventional treatment and/or local reuse.\n\nImportanceMultiple microbiological communities are capable of treating O&G PW in a simple, applied, engineered setting. The broad possibility of PW treatment by multiple different microbial consortia elucidates the potential for easy, effective, water reuse processes in the hydraulically-stressed arid west as well as any region generating PW from O&G operations.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCurrent understanding of hematopoiesis is largely derived from mouse models that are physiologically distant from humans. Humanized mice provide the most physiologically relevant small animal model to study human diseases, most notably preclinical gene-therapy studies. However, the clonal repopulation dynamics of human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) in these animal models is only partially understood. Using a new clonal tracking methodology designed for small sample volumes, we aim to reveal the underlying clonal dynamics of human cell repopulation in a mouse environment.\n\nMethodsHumanized BLT (bone marrow-liver-thymus) mice were generated by transplanting lentiviral vector transduced human fetal liver HSPC (FL-HSPC) in NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice implanted with a piece of human fetal thymus. We developed a methodology to track vector integration sites (VIS) in a mere 25{micro}l of mouse blood for longitudinal and quantitative clonal analysis of human HSPC repopulation in mouse environment. We explored transcriptional and epigenetic features of human HSPC for possible VIS bias.\n\nResults897 HSPC clones were longitudinally tracked in BLT mice--providing a first-ever demonstration of clonal dynamics and competitive expansion of therapeutic and control vector-modified human cell populations simultaneously repopulating in the same humanized mice. The polyclonal repopulation stabilized at 19 weeks post-transplant and the contribution of the largest clone doubled within 4 weeks. Moreover, 550 ([~]60%) clones persisted over 6 weeks and were highly shared between different organs. The normal clonal profiles confirmed the safety of our gene therapy vectors. Multi-omics analysis of human FL-HSPC revealed that 54% of vector integrations in repopulating clones occurred within {+/-}1kb of H3K36me3-enriched regions.\n\nConclusionsHuman repopulation in mice is polyclonal and stabilizes more rapidly than that previously observed in humans. VIS preference for H3K36me3 has no apparent negative effects on HSPC repopulation. Our study provides a methodology to longitudinally track clonal repopulation in small animal models extensively used for stem cell and gene-therapy research and with lentiviral vectors designed for clinical applications. Results of this study provide a framework for understanding the clonal behavior of human HPSC repopulating in a mouse environment, critical for translating results from humanized mice models to the human settings.",

    "abstract": "Improvements in the biological control of agricultural pests require improvements in the phenotyping methods used by practitioners to select efficient biological control agent (BCA) populations in industrial rearing or field conditions. Consistent inter-individual variations in behaviour (i.e. animal personality) probably affect BCA efficiency, but have never been taken into account in the development of phenotyping methods, despite having characteristics useful for phenotyping: repeatable (by definition), often heritable, etc. We developed a video-tracking method targeting animal personality traits and evaluated the feasibility of its use for genetic improvement in the BCA Trichogramma evanescens, by phenotyping 1,049 individuals from 24 isogenic lines. We found consistent individual variations in boldness, activity and exploration. Personality differences between the 24 isogenic lines suggested a genetic origin of the variations in activity and exploration (broad-sense heritability estimates of 0.06 to 0.11) and revealed a trade-off between exploration and fecundity.",

    "abstract": "Lima bean, Phaseolus lunatus, is closely related to common bean and is high in fiber and protein, with a low glycemic index. Lima bean is widely grown in the state of Delaware, where late summer and early fall weather are conducive to pod production. The same weather conditions also promote diseases such as pod rot and downy mildew, the latter of which has caused previous epidemics. A better understanding of the genes underlying resistance to this and other pathogens is needed to keep this industry thriving in the region. Our current study sought to sequence, assemble and annotate a commercially available cultivar called Bridgeton, which could then serve as a reference genome, a basis of comparison to other Phaseolus taxa and a resource for identification of potential resistance genes. Combined efforts of sequencing, linkage and comparative mapping analysis resulted in a 625 Mb genome assembly, as well as a better understanding of a locus underlying resistance to the current downy mildew race in the field.",

    "abstract": "Experimental methods that capture the individual properties of single cells are revealing the key role of cell-to-cell variability in countless biological processes. These single-cell methods are becoming increasingly important across the life sciences in fields such as immunology, regenerative medicine, and cancer biology. Existing single-cell analysis methods are often limited by their low analysis throughput, their inability to profile high-dimensional phenotypes, and complicated experimental workflows with slow turnaround times. In this work, we present Single-cell Nucleic Acid Profiling in Droplets (SNAPD) to analyze the transcriptional states of hundreds of thousands of single mammalian cells. Individual cells are encapsulated in aqueous droplets on a microfluidic chip and the content of each cell is profiled by amplifying a targeted panel of transcriptional markers. Molecular logic circuits then integrate this multi-dimensional information to categorize cells based on their transcriptional profile and produce a detectable fluorescence output. SNAPD analyzes over 100,000 cells per hour and can be used to quantify distinct cell types within populations, detect rare cells at frequencies down to 0.1%, and enrich specific cell types using microfluidic sorting. SNAPD provides a simple, rapid, low cost, and scalable approach to study complex phenotypes in heterogeneous cell populations.",

    "abstract": "Myelination plasticity plays a critical role in neurological function, including learning and memory. However, it is unknown whether this plasticity is enacted through uniform changes across all neuronal subtypes, or whether myelin dynamics vary between neuronal classes to enable fine-tuning of adaptive circuit responses. We performed in vivo two-photon imaging to investigate the dynamics of myelin sheaths along single axons of both excitatory callosal projection neurons and inhibitory parvalbumin+ interneurons in layer 2/3 of adult mouse visual cortex. We find that both neuron types show dynamic, homeostatic myelin remodeling under normal vision. However, monocular deprivation results in experience-dependent adaptive myelin remodeling only in parvalbumin+ interneurons, but not in callosal projection neurons. Monocular deprivation induces an initial increase in elongation events in myelin segments of parvalbumin+ interneurons, followed by a contraction phase affecting a separate cohort of segments. Sensory experience does not alter the generation rate of new myelinating oligodendrocytes, but can recruit pre-existing oligodendrocytes to generate new myelin sheaths. Parvalbumin+ interneurons also show a concomitant increase in axonal branch tip dynamics independent from myelination events. These findings suggest that adaptive myelination is part of a coordinated suite of circuit reconfiguration processes, and demonstrate that distinct classes of neocortical neurons individualize adaptive remodeling of their myelination profiles to diversify circuit tuning in response to sensory experience.",
