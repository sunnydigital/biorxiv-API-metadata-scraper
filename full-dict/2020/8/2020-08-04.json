    "abstract": "As we age, our tissues are repeatedly challenged by mutational insult, yet cancer occurrence is a relatively rare event. Cells carrying cancer-causing genetic mutations compete with normal neighbours for space and survival in tissues. However, the mechanisms underlying mutant-normal competition in adult tissues and the relevance of this process to cancer remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigate how the adult pancreas maintains tissue health in vivo following sporadic expression of oncogenic Kras (KrasG12D), the key driver mutation in human pancreatic cancer. We find that when present in tissues in low numbers, KrasG12D mutant cells are outcompeted and cleared from exocrine and endocrine compartments in vivo. Using quantitative 3D tissue imaging, we show that prior to being cleared, KrasG12D cells lose cell volume, segregate from normal cells and decrease E-cadherin-based cell-cell adhesions with normal neighbours. We identify EphA2 receptor is an essential signal in the clearance of KrasG12D cells from exocrine and endocrine tissues in vivo. In the absence of functional EphA2, KrasG12D cells no longer segregate, E-cadherin-based cell-cell adhesions increase and KrasG12D cells are retained in tissues. Retention of KRasG12D cells leads to an increased burden of premalignant pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanINs) in tissues. Our data show that adult pancreas tissues remodel to clear KrasG12D cells and maintain tissue health. This study provides evidence to support a conserved functional role of EphA2 in Ras-driven cell competition in epithelial tissues and suggests that EphA2 is a novel tumour suppressor in pancreatic cancer.",

    "abstract": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and responsible for the current pandemic. Recent SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and transmission studies in cats show that the virus can replicate in these companion animals and transmit to other cats. Here, we present an in-depth study of SARS-CoV-2 infection, associated disease and transmission dynamics in domestic cats. Six 4- to 5-month-old cats were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 via intranasal and oral routes simultaneously. One day post challenge (DPC), two sentinel contact cats were co-mingled with the principal infected animals. Animals were monitored for clinical signs, clinicopathological abnormalities and viral shedding throughout the 21 DPC observation period. Postmortem examinations were performed at 4, 7 and 21 DPC to investigate disease progression. Viral RNA was not detected in blood but transiently in nasal, oropharyngeal and rectal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid as well as various tissues. Tracheobronchoadenitis of submucosal glands with the presence of viral RNA and antigen was observed in airways of the infected cats on 4 and 7 DPC. Serology showed that both, principal and sentinel cats, developed SARS-CoV-2-specific and neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 detectable at 7 DPC or 10 DPC, respectively. All animals were clinically asymptomatic during the course of the study and capable of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to sentinels within 2 days of comingling. The results of this study are critical for our understanding of the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 in a naturally susceptible host species, and for risk assessment of the maintenance of SARS-CoV-2 in felines and transmission to other animals and humans.",

    "abstract": "Despite ongoing experiential change, neural activity maintains remarkable stability. Such stability is thought to be mediated by homeostatic plasticity and is deemed to be critical for normal neural function. However, what aspect of neural activity does homeostatic plasticity conserve, and how it still maintains the flexibility necessary for learning and memory, is not fully understood. Homeostatic plasticity is often studied in the context of neuron-centered control, where the deviations from the target activity for each individual neuron are suppressed. However, experimental studies suggest that there are additional, network-centered mechanisms. These may act through the inhibitory neurons, due to their dense network connectivity. Here we use a computational framework to study a potential mechanism for such homeostasis, using experimentally inspired, input-dependent inhibitory plasticity (IDIP). In a hippocampal CA1 spiking model, we show that IDIP in combination with place tuned input can explain the formation of active and silent place cells, as well as place cells remapping following optogenetic silencing of active place cells. Furthermore, we show that IDIP can also stabilise recurrent network dynamics, as well as preserve network firing rate heterogeneity and stimulus representation. Interestingly, in an associative memory task, IDIP facilitates persistent activity after memory encoding, in line with some experimental data. Hence, the establishment of global network balance with IDIP has diverse functional implications and may be able to explain experimental phenomena across different brain areas.",

    "abstract": "Despite the typical symmetrical appearance of the human brain, several functional and structural asymmetries have been reported. Language is the most commonly described lateralised cognitive function, relying relatively more on the left hemisphere in over 90% of the population. This is in line with white matter studies which have revealed leftwards lateralisation of the arcuate fasciculus, a white matter tract that connects important language-related regions. Most research to date examining the structure-function relationship of language lateralisation only included people showing a left language hemisphere dominance. As such, the reported correlations do not allow for inferences of relationships between the directions of functional and structural lateralisation of language.\n\nIn this work, we applied a state-of-the-art \"fixel-based\" analysis approach, which allows to statistically analyse white matter micro- and macrostructure on a fibre-specific level. To study lateralisation using this framework, we defined a bespoke fibre-specific laterality index which allowed us to examine whole-brain white matter asymmetries in samples of participants with left and right language dominance (LLD and RLD respectively). Both groups showed similar extensive and intricate patterns of significant white matter lateralisation. Few group differences were found between both groups, with a similar leftwards lateralisation of the arcuate fasciculus, regardless of functional language lateralisation of the participants. A significant group difference of lateralisation was detected in the forceps minor, with a leftwards lateralisation in LLD and rightwards lateralisation for the RLD group.\n\nIn conclusion, we showed that fixel-based analysis of fibre-specific lateralisation indices is an effective approach to study white matter asymmetries. Our results suggest that the lateralisation of language functioning and the arcuate fasciculus are driven by independent biases. The exact relationship between forceps minor asymmetry and language dominance could be an interesting subject of future studies.",

We investigated the genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 strains and present the first data on viruses circulating in the country.\n\nMethodsWe performed whole-genome sequencing and data analysis of SARS-CoV-2 eleven strains isolated in March and May.\n\nResultsStrains from travelers clustered with those from China, Saudi Arabia, India, USA and Australia. Five of eight SARS-CoV-2 strains were GH clade with Spike glycoprotein D614G, Ns3 gene Q57H, and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) P4715L mutations. Two were S (ORF8 L84S and N S202N) and three were L clade and one was an I clade strain. One GH and one L strain each displayed Orf1ab L3606F indicating further evolutionary transitions.\n\nConclusionsThis data reveals SARS-CoV-2 strains of L, G, S and I have been circulating in Pakistan from March, at the start of the pandemic. It indicates viral diversity regarding infection in this populous region. Continuing molecular genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in the context of disease severity will be important to understand virus transmission patterns and host related determinants of COVID-19 in Pakistan.",

Different features associated with the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, such as hyperinflammation and reduction of peripheral CD8+ T cell counts are strongly associated with severe disease. Here, we confirm the reduction in peripheral CD8+ T cells both in relative and absolute terms and identify T cell apoptosis and migration into inflamed tissues as possible mechanisms driving peripheral T cell lymphopenia. Furthermore, we find evidence of elevated serum interleukin-7, thus indicating systemic T cell paucity and signs of increased T cell proliferation in patients with severe lymphopenia. Following T cell lymphopenia in our pseudo-longitudinal time course, we observed expansion and recovery of poly-specific antiviral T cells, thus arguing for lymphopenia-induced T cell proliferation. In summary, this study suggests that extensive T cell loss and subsequent T cell proliferation are characteristic of severe COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) manifests with a range of severities, but immune signatures of mild and severe disease are still not fully understood. Excessive inflammation has been postulated to be a major factor in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and innate immune mechanisms are likely to be central in the inflammatory response. We used 40-plex mass cytometry and targeted serum proteomics to profile innate immune cell populations from peripheral blood of patients with mild or severe COVID-19 and healthy controls. Sampling at different stages of COVID-19 allowed us to reconstruct a pseudo-temporal trajectory of the innate immune response. Despite the expected patient heterogeneity, we identified consistent changes during the course of the infection. A rapid and early surge of CD169+ monocytes associated with an IFN{gamma}+MCP-2+ signature quickly followed symptom onset; at symptom onset, patients with mild and severe COVID-19 had a similar signature, but over the course of the disease, the differences between patients with mild and severe disease increased. Later in the disease course, we observed a more pronounced re-appearance of intermediate/non-classical monocytes and mounting systemic CCL3 and CCL4 levels in patients with severe disease. Our data provide new insights into the dynamic nature of the early inflammatory response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and identifies sustained pathological innate immune responses as a likely key mechanism in severe COVID-19, further supporting investigation of targeted anti-inflammatory interventions in severe COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "With the relatively serious global epidemic outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection, public concerns focus on not only clinical therapeutic measures and public quarantine for this disease but also the development of vaccines. The technical design of our SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine provides a viral antigen that enables the exposure of more than one structural protein based upon the antibody composition of COVID-19 patients convalescent serum. This design led to valid immunity with increasing neutralizing antibody titers and a CTL response detected post-immunization of this vaccine by two injections in rhesus macaques. Further, this elicited immunoprotection in macaques enables not only to restrain completely viral replication in tissues of immunized animals, compared to the adjuvant control and those immunized by an RBD peptide vaccine, but also to significantly alleviate inflammatory lesion in lung tissues in histo-pathologic detection, compared to the adjuvant control with developed interstitial pneumonia. The data obtained from these macaques immunized with the inactivated vaccine or RBD peptide vaccine suggest that immunity with a clinically protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection should include not only specific neutralizing antibodies but also specific CTL responses against at least the S and N antigens.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionary pressures that determine the location (chromosomal or plasmid-borne) of bacterial genes are not fully understood. We investigate these pressures through mathematical modelling in the context of antibiotic resistance, which is often found on plasmids. Our central finding is that gene location is under positive frequency-dependent selection: the higher the frequency of one form of resistance compared to the other, the higher its relative fitness. This can keep moderately beneficial genes on plasmids, despite occasional plasmid loss. For these genes, positive frequency-dependence leads to a priority effect: whichever form is acquired first - through either mutation or horizontal gene transfer - has time to increase in frequency and thus become difficult to displace. Higher rates of horizontal transfer of plasmid-borne than chromosomal genes therefore predict moderately beneficial genes will be found on plasmids. Gene flow between plasmid and chromosome allows chromosomal forms to arise, but positive frequencydependent selection prevents these from establishing. Further modelling shows this effect is particularly pronounced when genes are shared across a large number of species, suggesting antibiotic resistance genes are often found on plasmids because they are moderately beneficial across many species. We also revisit previous theoretical work - relating to the role of local adaptation in explaining gene location and to plasmid persistence - in light of our findings.\n\nImpact StatementBacterial genes can either reside on the chromosome or on plasmids, extra-chromosomal genetic structures which can be transferred from cell to cell. The distribution of genes between plasmid and chromosome is not random: certain types of genes are particularly likely to be plasmid-associated. This includes a number of clinically important traits, such as antibiotic resistance and virulence factors. The evolutionary mechanisms that give rise to this pattern are not well understood. Plasmids are occasionally lost during cell replication and thus less reliably inherited than the chromosome, and genes are free to transition between plasmid and chromosome: so what keeps genes on plasmids? We address this question using a mathematical model. The key prediction from our model is that the relative fitness of chromosomal and plasmid-borne genes depends on their relative frequencies ( positive frequency-dependent selection). In other words, the fitness of a plasmid-borne gene will be higher in a population in which the chromosomal gene is rare (and vice-versa). This positive-frequency dependence can keep moderately beneficial genes on plasmids, despite occasional plasmid loss. This leads to a priority effect: whichever form of the gene (i.e. plasmid-borne or chromosomal) is acquired first has time to increase in frequency and thus become difficult to displace. Therefore, the relative rate of acquiring the gene on the plasmid vs the chromosome predicts where the gene will be found. Further modelling shows this effect is particularly pronounced when genes are beneficial across a large number of species. All together, the hypothesis that emerges from our work is that plasmid-borne genes are moderately beneficial; functional across a large number of species; and rarely acquired through chromosomal mutation. We suggest traits like antibiotic resistance are often found on plasmids because these genes commonly fulfill these criteria.",

    "abstract": "Alternative polyadenylation (APA) profoundly expands the transcriptome complexity. Perturbations of APA can disrupt biological processes, ultimately resulting in devastating disorders. A major challenge in identifying mechanisms and consequences of APA (and its perturbations) lies in the complexity of RNA 3end processing, involving poorly conserved RNA motifs and multi-component complexes consisting of far more than 50 proteins. This is further complicated in that RNA 3end maturation is closely linked to transcription, RNA processing, and even epigenetic (histone/DNA/RNA) modifications. Here we present TREND-DB (http://shiny.imbei.uni-mainz.de:3838/trend-db), a resource cataloging the dynamic landscape of APA after depletion of >170 proteins involved in various facets of transcriptional, co- and posttranscriptional gene regulation, epigenetic modifications, and further processes. TREND-DB visualizes the dynamics of transcriptome 3end diversification (TREND) in a highly interactive manner; it provides a global APA network map and allows interrogating genes affected by specific APA-regulators, and vice versa. It also permits condition-specific functional enrichment analyses of APA-affected genes, which suggest wide biological and clinical relevance across all RNAi conditions. The implementation of the UCSC Genome Browser provides additional customizable layers of gene regulation accounting for individual transcript isoforms (e.g. epigenetics, miRNA binding sites, RNA-binding proteins).

    "abstract": "Read alignment is the central step of many analytic pipelines that perform SNP calling. To reduce error, it is common practice to pre-process raw sequencing reads to remove low-quality bases and residual adapter contamination, a procedure collectively known as  trimming. Trimming is widely assumed to increase the accuracy of SNP calling although there are relatively few systematic evaluations of its effects and no clear consensus on its efficacy. As sequencing datasets increase both in number and size, it is worthwhile reappraising computational operations of ambiguous benefit, particularly when the scope of many analyses now routinely incorporate thousands of samples, increasing the time and cost required.\n\nUsing a curated set of 17 Gram-negative bacterial genomes, this study evaluated the impact of four read trimming utilities (Atropos, fastp, Trim Galore, and Trimmomatic), each used with a range of stringencies, on the accuracy and completeness of three bacterial SNP calling pipelines. We found that read trimming made only small, and statistically insignificant, increases in SNP calling accuracy even when using the highest-performing pre-processor, fastp.\n\nTo extend these findings, we re-analysed > 6500 publicly-archived sequencing datasets from E. coli, M. tuberculosis and S. aureus. Of the approximately 125 million SNPs called across all samples, the same bases were called in 98.8% of cases, irrespective of whether raw reads or trimmed reads were used. However, when using trimmed reads, the proportion of non-homozygous calls (a proxy of false positives) was significantly reduced by approximately 1%. This suggests that trimming rarely alters the set of variant bases called but can affect their level of support. We conclude that read quality- and adapter-trimming add relatively little value to a SNP calling pipeline and may only be necessary if small differences in the absolute number of SNP calls are critical. Read trimming remains routinely performed prior to SNP calling likely out of concern that to do otherwise would substantially increase the number of false positive calls. While historically this may have been the case, our data suggests this concern is now unfounded.\n\nImpact StatementShort-read sequencing data is routinely pre-processed before use, to trim off low-quality regions and remove contaminating sequences introduced during its preparation. This cleaning procedure -  read trimming - is widely assumed to increase the accuracy of any later analyses, although there are relatively few systematic evaluations of trimming strategies and no clear consensus on their efficacy. We used real sequencing data from 17 bacterial genomes to show that several commonly-used read trimming tools, used across a range of stringencies, had only a minimal, statistically insignificant, effect on later SNP calling. To extend these results, we re-analysed > 6500 publicly-archived sequencing datasets, calling SNPs both with and without any read trimming. We found that of the approximately 125 million SNPs within this dataset, 98.8% were identically called irrespective of whether raw reads or trimmed reads were used. Taken together, these results question the necessity of read trimming as a routine pre-processing operation.\n\nData SummaryAll analyses conducted in this study use publicly-available third-party software. All data and parameters necessary to replicate these analyses are provided within the article or through supplementary data files. > 6500 SRA sample accessions, representing Illumina paired-end sequencing data from E. coli, M. tuberculosis and S.aureus, and used to evaluate the impact of fastq pre-processing, are listed in Supplementary Tables 3, 5 and 7.",

    "abstract": "Diptera is a megadiverse group of flies with sophisticated chemical detection systems, which exploits an incredible variety of ecological niches. Among the vast array of odorants in natural environments, indoles stand out as playing crucial roles in mediating fly behavior. In mosquitoes, indolic compounds are detected by an ancient class of conserved indolergic Odorant Receptors (indolORs). In this study, we have identified a set of 92 putative indolOR genes encoded in the genomes of Nematoceran and Brachyceran flies, resolved their phylogenetic relationships, and defined conserved elements in their gene structures. Further, we have quantified indolOR transcript abundance in the antennae of the housefly, Musca domestica, and have characterized MdomOR30a as a skatole receptor using a heterologous expression system. The presence of indolORs in species operating in different ecological contexts suggests that indoles act as pleiotropic signals for resource exploitation at multiple developmental stages. Further characterization of indolORs will impact our understanding of insect chemical ecology and will provide targets for the development of novel odor-based tools that can be integrated into existing vector surveillance and control programs.",

    "abstract": "One of the most important proteins for COVID-19 pathogenesis in SARS-CoV2 is the ORF3a protein which is the largest accessory protein among others accessory proteins coded by coronavirus genome. The major roles of the protein include virulence, infectivity, ion channel activity, morphogenesis and virus release. The coronavirus, SARS-CoV2 is continuously evolving naturally and thereby the encoded proteins are also mutating rapidly. Therefore, critical study of mutations in ORF3a is certainty important from the pathogenetic perspective. Here, a sum of 175 various non-synonymous mutations in the ORF3a protein of SARS-CoV2 are identified and their corresponding effects in structural stability and functions of the protein ORF3a are studied. Broadly three different classes of mutations, such as neutral, disease and mixed (neutral and disease) type mutations were observed. Consecutive mutations in some ORF3a proteins are established based on timeline of detection of mutations. Considering the amino acid compositions over the ORF3a primary protein sequences, twenty clusters are detected based on K-means clustering method. Our findings on 175 novel mutations of ORF3a proteins will extend our knowledge of ORF3a, a vital accessory protein in SARS-CoV2, which would assist to enlighten on the pathogenicity of this life-threatening COVID-19.",

Here, by using a set of 113 samples with variable region sequences matching clinical-stage antibodies, we demonstrated that a considerable number of these antibodies interact with heme. Antibodies that interact with heme possess specific sequence traits of their antigen-binding regions. Moreover they manifest particular physicochemical and functional qualities i.e. increased hydrophobicity, higher propensity of self-binding, higher intrinsic polyreactivity and reduced expression yields. Thus, interaction with heme is a strong predictor of different molecular and functional qualities of antibodies. Notably, these qualities are of high importance for therapeutic antibodies, as their presence was associated with failure of drug candidates to reach clinic. Our study reveled an important facet of information about relationship sequence-function in antibodies. It also offers a convenient tool for detection of liabilities of therapeutic antibodies.",

    "abstract": "The genus Orthobunyavirus are a group of viruses within arbovirus, with a zoonotic cycle, some of which could lead to human infection. A characteristic of these viruses is their lack of antiviral treatment or vaccine for its prevention. The objective of this work was to study the in vitro antiviral activity of nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), the most important active compound of Larrea divaricata Cav. (Zigophyllaceae), against Fort Sherman-like virus (FSV-like) as a model of Orthobunyavirus genus. At the same time, the effect of NDGA as a lipolytic agent on the cell cycle of this viral model was assessed. The method of reducing plaque forming units on LLC-MK2 cells was used to detect the action of NDGA on CbaAr426 and SFCrEq231 isolates of FSV-like. NDGA did not show virucidal effect, but it had antiviral activity with a similar inhibition in both isolates, which was dose dependent. It was established that the NDGA has a better inhibition one-hour post infection (p.i.), showing a different behavior in each isolate, which was dependent upon the time p.i. Since virus multiplication is dependent on host cell lipid metabolism, the antiviral effect of NDGA has been previously related to its ability to disturb the lipid metabolism, probably by interfering with the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP) pathway and the 5-lipoxigenase (5-LOX). We determined by using caffeic acid, a 5-LOX inhibitor, that the inhibition of this enzyme negatively affected the FSV-like replication; and by the use of resveratrol, a SREBP1 inhibitor, it was showed that the negative regulation of this pathway only had action on the SFCrEq231 reduction. In addition, it was proved that the NDGA acts intracellularly, since it showed the ability to incorporate into LLC-MK2 cells. The information provided in this work converts the NDGA in a good antiviral candidate, especially for Orthobunyavirus infections, and a useful tool for the biochemical study of FSV-like that causes an infection poorly studied and potentially dangerous.",

About 200 NES motifs have been identified, but over a thousand human proteins are potential CRM1 cargos, and most of their NESs remain to be identified. On the other hand, the interaction of NES peptides with the \"NES-binding groove\" of CRM1 has been studied in detail using structural and biochemical analyses, but a better understanding of CRM1 function requires further investigation of how the results from these in vitro studies translate into actual NES export in a cellular context. Here we show that a simple cellular assay, based on a recently described reporter (SRVB/A), can be applied to identify novel potential NESs motifs, and to obtain relevant information on different aspects of CRM1-mediated NES export. Using cellular assays, we first map 19 new sequence motifs with nuclear export activity in 14 cancer-related proteins that are potential CRM1 cargos. Next, we investigate the effect of mutations in individual NES-binding groove residues, providing further insight into CRM1-mediated NES export. Finally, we extend the search for CRM1-dependent NESs to a recently uncovered, but potentially vast, set of small proteins called micropeptides. By doing so, we report the first NES-harbouring human micropeptides.",

    "abstract": "Norepinephrine plays an important role in modulating the processes of memory consolidation and evocation through its beta-adrenergic receptors (Adr{beta}), which are expressed in the hippocampus and amygdala. Several studies have shown that all three subtypes of Adr{beta} ({beta}1, {beta}2 and {beta}3) play an important role in cognition. Environmental enrichment (EE), a technique initially used to decrease the stress of animals held in captive environments, has also been shown to produce cognitive benefits in both healthy and sick animals. In this study, we hypothesized that EE would reverse the memory impairment induced by the absence or Adr{beta}3. To test this, 21- and 86-day-old Adr{beta}3KO mice were exposed to an EE protocol for 8 weeks. The study showed that the EE protocol is able to correct the memory impairment when applied to Adr{beta}3KO animals immediately after weaning but has no effect when applied to adult animals. We also found that aging worsens the memory of Adr{beta}3KO mice. Our results suggest that a richer and more diverse environment helps to correct memory impairment in Adr{beta}3KO animals. They also reinforce the idea that noradrenergic signaling is involved in the cognitive impairment observed late in life, as aging led to a worsening in the memory of the Adr{beta}3KO animals that was not corrected by the environmental enrichment protocol.",

Flow cytometric data of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) and coefficient variation (CV) were considered to the energy and the fluctuation, respectively. Topologically, the changes of MFI and CV were categorized into five patterns (we tentatively named as attractive, subsequent, passive, counter, and negative arbiter). In this study, we clarified the relationship between the cell behavior and the five patterns. Furthermore, combining the five patterns can define the signaling pathways, such as simple activated signal, oscillating signal, regulatory signal, robust signal, or homeostatic signal.

The underlying mechanisms are not very well understood. Here, we show that stretching the plasma membrane of somatic cyst cell around rigid spermatid heads generates a stable, tubular endomembrane scaffold supported by contractile actomyosin. The structure resembles an actin-basket covering the bundle of spermatid heads. Genetic analysis suggests that the actomyosin organisation is nucleated exclusively by the Formins, Diaphanous and DAAM, downstream of Rho1, recruited by the Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs (BAR)-domain protein, Amphiphysin, around the spermatid heads. Actomyosin activity at the actin-basket gathers the spermatid heads into a compact bundle and resists the invasion of the somatic cell by the intruding spermatids. These observations revealed a new response mechanism of nanoscale bending of the plasma membrane, which generates a novel cell adhesion strategy through active clamping.\n\nHighlightsO_LIStretching the plasma membrane around a spermatid head recruits Amphiphysin and Rho1.\nC_LIO_LIRho1 activation triggers F-actin assembly in situ through Diaphanous and DAAM.\nC_LIO_LIRho1-Rok activation assembles actomyosin scaffold around the folded plasma membrane.\nC_LIO_LIContractile actomyosin enables plasma membrane to clamp onto the spermatid head.\nC_LI\n\nAuthor summarySperm released from the somatic enclosure is essential for male fertility. During differentiation, the somatic cell membrane, associated with dense F-actin scaffold, tightly hold each spermatid head before release.

    "abstract": "Achromobacter species are increasingly being detected in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), and this emerging pathogen is associated with antibiotic resistance and more severe disease outcomes. Nonetheless, little is known about the extent of transmission and antibiotic resistance development in Achromobacter infections.\n\nWe sequenced the genomes of 101 clinical isolates of Achromobacter (A. xylosoxidans based on MALDI-TOF/API N20 typing) collected from 51 patients with CF--the largest longitudinal dataset to-date. We performed phylogenetic analysis on the genomes and combined this with epidemiological and antibiotic resistance data to identify patient-to-patient transmission and development of antibiotic resistance.\n\nWe found that MALDI-TOF/API N20 was not sufficient for Achromobacter species-level typing, and that the population of Achromobacter isolates was composed of five different species where A. xylosoxidans accounted for 52% of infections. Most patients were infected by unique Achromobacter clone types; nonetheless, suspected patient-to-patient transmission cases identified by shared clone types were observed in 35% (N=18) of patients. In 15 of 16 cases the suspected transmissions were further supported by genome- or clinic visit-based epidemiological analysis. Finally, we found that resistance developed over time.\n\nWe show that whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is essential for Achromobacter species typing and patient-to-patient transmission identification which was identified in A. ruhlandii, A. xylosoxidans and, for the first time, A. insuavis. Furthermore, we show that the development of antibiotic resistance is associated with chronic Achromobacter infections.

There is considerable debate about the replicative status of these persistent parasites. Here, we investigated T. cruzi proliferation in the colon of chronically infected mice using 5-ethynyl-2deoxyuridine incorporation into DNA to provide \"snapshots\" of parasite replication. Highly sensitive imaging of infection foci at single cell resolution revealed that parasites are three times more likely to be in S-phase during the acute stage than during the chronic stage. By implication, chronic infections are associated with a reduced rate of parasite replication. Despite this, very few host cells survive infection for >14 days, suggesting that T. cruzi persistence continues to involve regular cycles of replication, host cell lysis and re-infection. Therefore, long-term persistence in the colon is more likely to be associated with reduced proliferation than with dormancy.",

    "abstract": "Neural codes for sensory representations are thought to reside in a broader space defined by the patterns of spontaneous activity that occur when stimuli are not being presented. To understand the structure of this spontaneous activity in the olfactory system, we performed high-density recordings of population activity in the main olfactory bulb of awake mice. We found that spontaneous activity patterns of ensembles of mitral and tufted (M/T) cells in the main olfactory bulb changed dramatically during locomotion, including decreases in pairwise correlations between neurons and increases in the entropy of the population. Maximum entropy models of the ensemble activity revealed that pair-wise interactions were better at predicting patterns of activity when the animal was stationary than while running, suggesting that higher order (3rd, 4th order) interactions between neurons shape activity during locomotion. Taken together, we found that locomotion influenced the structure of spontaneous population activity at the earliest stages of olfactory processing, 1 synapse away from the sensory receptors in the nasal epithelium.\n\nNew and NoteworthyThe organization and structure of spontaneous population activity in the olfactory system places constraints of how odor information is represented. Using high-density electrophysiological recordings of mitral and tufted cells, we found that running increases the dimensionality of spontaneous activity, implicating higher-order interactions among neurons during locomotion. Behavior thus flexibly alters neuronal activity at the earliest stages of sensory processing.",

    "abstract": "Neural codes for sensory representations are thought to reside in a broader space defined by the patterns of spontaneous activity that occur when stimuli are not being presented. To understand the structure of this spontaneous activity in the olfactory system, we performed high-density recordings of population activity in the main olfactory bulb of awake mice. We found that spontaneous activity patterns of ensembles of mitral and tufted (M/T) cells in the main olfactory bulb changed dramatically during locomotion, including decreases in pairwise correlations between neurons and increases in the entropy of the population. Maximum entropy models of the ensemble activity revealed that pair-wise interactions were better at predicting patterns of activity when the animal was stationary than while running, suggesting that higher order (3rd, 4th order) interactions between neurons shape activity during locomotion. Taken together, we found that locomotion influenced the structure of spontaneous population activity at the earliest stages of olfactory processing, 1 synapse away from the sensory receptors in the nasal epithelium.\n\nNew and NoteworthyThe organization and structure of spontaneous population activity in the olfactory system places constraints of how odor information is represented. Using high-density electrophysiological recordings of mitral and tufted cells, we found that running increases the dimensionality of spontaneous activity, implicating higher-order interactions among neurons during locomotion. Behavior thus flexibly alters neuronal activity at the earliest stages of sensory processing.",

    "abstract": "Plants acclimate their photosynthetic capacity in response to changing environmental conditions. In Arabidopsis thaliana, photosynthetic acclimation to cold requires the accumulation of the organic acid fumarate, catalysed by a cytosolic fumarase FUM2, however the role of this is currently unclear.\n\nIn this study, we use an integrated experimental and modelling approach to examine the role of FUM2 and fumarate across the physiological temperature range. Using physiological and biochemical analyses, we demonstrate that FUM2 is necessary for high as well as low temperature acclimation.\n\nTo understand the role of FUM2 activity, we have adapted a reliability engineering technique, Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA), to formalize a rigorous approach for ranking metabolites according to the potential risk that they pose to the metabolic system. FMEA identifies fumarate as a low-risk metabolite. Its precursor, malate, is shown to be high-risk and liable to cause system instability. We conclude that the role of cytosolic fumarase, FUM2, is to provide a fail-safe, maintaining system stability under changing environmental conditions.\n\nWe argue that FMEA is a technique which is not only useful in understanding plant metabolism, it can also be used to study reliability in other systems and aid the design of synthetic pathways.",

The endothelial volume regulatory anion channel (VRAC) has been proposed to be mechano-sensitive, to activate in response to fluid flow/hydrostatic pressure and putatively regulate vascular reactivity and angiogenesis. Here, we show that the Leucine Rich Repeat Containing Protein 8a, LRRC8a (SWELL1) functionally encodes VRAC in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Endothelial SWELL1 (SWELL1) expression positively regulates AKT-eNOS signaling while negatively regulating mTOR signaling, via a SWELL1-GRB2-Cav1-eNOS signaling complex. Endothelium-restricted SWELL1 KO (SWELL1 KO) mice exhibit enhanced tube formation from ex-vivo aortic ring explants in matrigel angiogenesis assays, develop hypertension in response to chronic angiotensin II infusion and have impaired retinal blood flow with both diffuse and focal blood vessel narrowing in the setting of Type 2 diabetes (T2D). These data demonstrate that SWELL1 antithetically regulates AKT-eNOS and mTOR signaling in endothelium and is required for maintaining vascular function, particularly in the setting of T2D.",

Trypanosomes cause African sleeping sickness and Chagas disease in South America, and Leishmania RO_SCPLOWOSSC_SCPLOW, 1903 species mutilate and kill hundreds of thousands of people each year. However, human pathogens are very few when compared to the great diversity of trypanosomatids. Despite the progresses made in the past decades on understanding the evolution of this group of organisms, there are still many open questions which require robust phylogenetic markers to increase the resolution of trees.\n\nMethodsUsing two known 18S rDNA template structures (from Trypanosoma cruzi CO_SCPLOWHAGASC_SCPLOW, 1909 and Trypanosoma brucei PO_SCPLOWLIMMERC_SCPLOW & BO_SCPLOWRADFORDC_SCPLOW, 1899), individual 18S rDNA secondary structures were predicted by homology modeling. Sequences and their secondary structures, automatically encoded by a 12-letter alphabet (each nucleotide with its three structural states, paired left, paired right, unpaired), were simultaneously aligned. Sequence-structure trees were generated by neighbor joining and/or maximum likelihood.\n\nResultsWith a few exceptions, all nodes within a sequence-structure maximum likelihood tree of 43 representative 18S rDNA sequence-structure pairs are robustly supported (bootstrap support >75). Even a quick and easy sequence-structure neighbor-joining analysis yields accurate results and enables reconstruction and discussion of the big picture for all 240 18S rDNA sequence-structure pairs of trypanosomatids that are currently available.\n\nConclusionsWe reconstructed the phylogeny of a comprehensive sampling of trypanosomes evaluated in the context of trypanosomatid diversity, demonstrating that the simultaneous use of 18S rDNA sequence and secondary structure data can reconstruct robust phylogenetic trees.",

However, imaging cell- and tissue-level processes in intact animals poses numerous challenges if the organism is opaque and/or motile. Explant cultures of intact tissues circumvent some of these challenges, but sample drift remains a considerable obstacle. We employed a simple yet effective technique to immobilize tissues in medium-bathed agarose. We applied this technique to study multiple Drosophila tissues from first-instar larvae to adult stages in various orientations and with no evidence of anisotropic pressure or stress damage. Using this method, we were able to image fine features for up to 18 hours and make novel observations. Specifically, we report that fibers characteristic of quiescent neuroblasts are inherited by their basal daughters during reactivation; that the lamina in the developing visual system is assembled roughly 2-3 columns at a time; that lamina glia positions are dynamic during development; and that the nuclear envelopes of adult testis cyst stem cells do not break down completely during mitosis. In all, we demonstrate that our protocol is well-suited for tissue immobilization and long-term live imaging, enabling new insights into tissue and cell dynamics in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "Unveiling the relationship between taxonomy and function in microbiomes is crucial to determine their contribution to ecosystem functioning. However, while the relationship between taxonomic and functional diversity in bacteria and fungi was reported, this is not the case for archaea. Here, we used a meta-analysis of completely annotated extant genomes of 417 taxonomically unique archaeal species to describe intergenome and intragenome redundancy of functions and to predict the extent of microbiome functionality on Earth contained within archaeal genomes using accumulation curves of all known functions from the level 3 of KEGG Orthology. We found that intergenome redundancy as functions present in multiple genomes was inversely related to intragenome redundancy as multiple copies of a gene in one genome, implying the trade of between additional copies of functionally important genes or a higher number of different genes. A logarithmic model described the relationship between functional diversity and species richness better than both the unsaturated and the saturated model, which suggests a limited total number of archaeal functions in contrast to the potential of bacteria and fungi. Using a global archaeal species richness estimate of 13,159, the logarithmic model predicts a total of 4,164.1 {+/-}2.9 KEGG level 3 functions while the non-parametric bootstrap estimate yields a lower bound of 2,994 {+/-}57 KEGG level 3 functions.

Emerging evidence suggests an important role for IL-1{beta} in promoting cancer progression in patients, but the underlying mechanisms are little understood. Here, we show a key role for IL-1{beta} in driving tumor progression in two distinct mouse tumor models. Notably, inflammasome activation and GSDMD were dispensable for the production of intratumoral bioactive IL-1{beta}, which promoted systemic mobilization and infiltration of neutrophils into tumors. Neutrophils recruited via IL-1{beta} suppressed the acquisition of an effector T-cell phenotype and subsequent antitumor immune response. Moreover, IL-1{beta} was essential for neutrophil accumulation upon antiangiogenic therapy, thereby contributing to therapy-induced immunosuppression. Antitumor immunity in the absence of IL-1{beta}-dependent neutrophil recruitment relied on immunostimulatory macrophages which promoted the infiltration and activation of cytotoxic T-cells. Overall, these results support a tumor-promoting role for IL-1{beta} through establishing an immunosuppressive microenvironment and show that inflammasome activation is not essential for its release in tumors.",

Children with asthma have a characteristically dysbiotic virome that correlates to disease severity and control. The major component of dysbiosis is bacteriophage deficiency, while eukaryotic viral presence is increased. At the metacommunity level, differential virus species co-occurrence patterns suggest a decrease of the microbiota community resilience in asthma.

Didymeles, with three species endemic to Madagascar, and the monotypic Haptanthus from Honduras, are the most unusual members of the group. The infra-familial classification of Buxaceae is controversial, and molecular data about many species, especially Old World, is still lacking. We used broad taxonomic sampling and molecular data from four chloroplast markers, and the nuclear ribosomal ITS to estimate their phylogeny. These data provide phylogenetic placements of 50 species and enabled better estimates of boundaries in Buxaceae.

    "abstract": "Pursuing rewards while avoiding danger is an essential function of any nervous system. Here, we examine a new mechanism helping rats negotiate the balance between risk and reward when making high-stakes decisions. Specifically, we focus on GABA neurons within an emerging mesolimbic circuit nexus--the ventral pallidum (VP). These neurons play a distinct role from other VP neurons in simple motivated behaviors in mice, but their roles in more complex motivated behaviors is unknown. Here, we interrogate the behavioral functions of VPGABA neurons in male and female transgenic GAD1:Cre rats (and wildtype littermates), using a reversible chemogenetic inhibition approach. Employing a behavioral assay of risky decision making, and of the food-seeking and shock-avoidance components of this task, we show that engaging inhibitory Gi/o signaling specifically in VPGABA neurons suppresses motivation to pursue highly salient palatable foods, and possibly also motivation to avoid being shocked. In contrast, inhibiting these neurons did not affect seeking of low-value food, free consumption of palatable food, or unconditioned affective responses to shock. Accordingly, when rats considered whether to pursue food despite potential for shock in a risky decision-making task, inhibiting VPGABA neurons caused them to more readily select a small but safe reward over a large but dangerous one--an effect not seen in the absence of shock threat. Together, results indicate that VPGABA neurons are critical for high-stakes adaptive responding that is necessary for survival, but which may also malfunction in psychiatric disorders.\n\nSignificance StatementIn a dynamic world, it is essential to implement appropriate behaviors under circumstances involving rewards, threats, or both. Here, we demonstrate a crucial role for VPGABA neurons in high-stakes motivated behavior of several types. We show that this VPGABA role in motivation impacts decision making, as inhibiting these neurons yields a conservative, risk-averse strategy not seen when the task is performed without threat of shock. These new roles for VPGABA neurons in behavior may inform future strategies for treating addiction, and other disorders of maladaptive decision making.",

However, we still do not understand well how these two types of traits relate to body condition (e.g. size, hydration) and environmental variables (e.g. relative humidity), some of which are typical aspects of thermal tolerance experiments (warming rates, start temperature). We explored these interactions using a set of experiments that sequentially measure behavioral (Voluntary Thermal Maxima) and physiological thermal tolerance (Critical Thermal Maxima) for individuals of Atta sexdens rubropilosa (Forel, 1908). We found non-linear effects of body size on behavioral thermal tolerance and refuted the traditional hypothesis that body size increases ants physiological thermal tolerance. Hydration state and humidity had complex effects on behavioral and physiological tolerance. However, both tolerance measures increased with heating rates and start temperature. Our work helps understanding how an ectotherm integrates stimuli affecting its thermal tolerance to decide which temperatures to avoid. We discuss implications for the ecology of ants, their labor division, and for their susceptibility to climate warming and drought.\n\nSummary StatementHere we show how internal (body size, hydration level) and external factors (heating rate, relative humidity) affect leaf-cutting ants behavioral and physiological responses to temperature rises.",

    "abstract": "We present a comprehensive statistical framework to analyze data from genome-wide association studies of polygenic traits, producing distinct and interpretable discoveries while controlling the false discovery rate. This approach leverages sophisticated multivariate models, correcting for linkage disequilibrium, and accounts for population structure and relatedness, adapting to the characteristics of the samples at hand. A key element is the recognition that the observed genotypes can be considered as a random sample from an appropriate model, encapsulating our knowledge of genetic inheritance and human populations. This allows us to generate imperfect copies (knockoffs) of these variables which serve as ideal negative controls; knockoffs are indistinguishable from the original genotypes in distribution, and independent from the phenotype. In sharp contrast with state-of-the-art methods, the validity of our inference in no way depends on assumptions about the unknown relation between genotypes and phenotype. We develop and leverage a model for the genotypes that accounts for arbitrary and unknown population structure, which may be due to diverse ancestries or familial relatedness. We build a pipeline that is robust to the most prominent possible confounders, facilitating the discovery of causal variants. Validity and effectiveness are demonstrated by extensive simulations with real data, as well as by the analysis of several phenotypes in the UK Biobank. Finally, fast software is made available for researchers to apply the proposed methodology to Biobank-scale data sets.",

A class was randomly selected in four school grades (1-4) along with 30 students from each to take the Test of Gross Motor Development-2 (TGMD-2). A total of 117 children (42 girls, aged 7-10) participated in three tests: TGMD-2, MF tests, and FMS. MF levels (good, fair, and poor) and FMS levels (high, moderate, and low) were classified according to specific percentile ranges. A multiple (RxC) chi-square test analysis of the relationship between MF, FMS, and FMS was applied and post hoc testing estimated the possibility of FMS and FMS predicting MF. The results showed that only 43% of children were rated \"good\" on MF. Most fourth-grade students exhibited a certain gap with mature FMS (TGMD-2 score 70.13{+/-}9.68< 96 full scores).

The results of multiple chi-square demonstrated FMS to be weakly correlated with MF, {chi}2 (4,N=117) =14.605, p =0.006< 0.01, Cramers V = 0.25. Both 60.5% of \"excellent\" FMS and 59.6% of \"high\" FMS children were categorized as having a \"good\" MF level. On the other hand, only 23.1% of the \"worst\" FMS and 24.3% of \"low\" FMS individuals were classified as having a \"good\" MF level. Our results suggest that MF, FMS, FMS are relatively independent systems linking with each other, generating mutual interaction in childrens motor development. At different stages or different advantages of them motor development, we may emphasize training one or a few parts.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of ewe growth performance, serum biochemical indicators and lamb growth and development at different protein levels in late pregnancy. A total of 15 pregnant ewes (46.4 {+/-} 1.38kg initial BW) were assigned to 3 groups with 5 ewes in each group in a randomized block design. P1, P2 and P3 of three groups were fed diets with different levels of crude protein at 11.25%, 12.5% and 13.75% (low, medium and high) respectively, while the dietary energy levels remained unchanged. Choose ewes with the same body condition from 90 days of pregnancy to different protein diets during delivery, and feed the same diets during lactation. New-born lambs were left to suckle their dams freely for the first three days and were kept with their dams till weaning at 60 days of age. Dietary protein levels during late gestation showed no significant effect on the weight gain of ewes and their offspring in the late pregnancy (P > 0.05) but had significant effects on blood urea nitrogen (BUN), glucose (GLU), C-reactive protein (CRPL3) and ammonia nitrogen (NH3L) before parturition, and on triglyceride (TG) in lactating ewes. Dietary protein levels during late gestation had significant effects on birth height, body length, chest depth, chest circumference, straight crown hip length and curved crown hip length of lambs (P < 0.05) as well as on weaning body length, chest circumference, head width and head length (P < 0.05). The results showed that although different dietary protein levels during late gestation have no significant effects on growth performance of ewes, singleton, twins and triplets, it affects lambs body shape and ewes metabolism. Therefore, the optimum protein concentration for the growth of ewes and subsequent lambs in this experiment is 11.25%.",

    "abstract": "DNA repair requires reorganization of the local chromatin structure to facilitate access to and repair of the DNA. Studying DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair in specific chromatin domains has been aided by the use of sequence-specific endonucleases to generate targeted breaks. Here, we describe a new approach that combines KillerRed, a photosensitizer that generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) when exposed to light, and the genome-targeting properties of the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Fusing KillerRed to catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) generates dCas9-KR, which can then be targeted to any desired genomic region with an appropriate guide RNA. Activation of dCas9-KR with green light generates a local increase in reactive oxygen species, resulting in \"clustered\" oxidative damage, including both DNA breaks and base damage. Activation of dCas9-KR rapidly (within minutes) increases both {gamma}H2AX and recruitment of the KU70/80 complex. Importantly, this damage is repaired within 10 minutes of termination of light exposure, indicating that the DNA damage generated by dCas9-KR is both rapid and transient. Further, repair is carried out exclusively through NHEJ, with no detectable contribution from HR-based mechanisms. Surprisingly, sequencing of repaired DNA damage regions did not reveal any increase in either mutations or INDELs in the targeted region, implying that NHEJ has high fidelity under the conditions of low level, limited damage. The dCas9-KR approach for creating targeted damage has significant advantages over the use of endonucleases, since the duration and intensity of DNA damage can be controlled in \"real time\" by controlling light exposure. In addition, unlike endonucleases that carry out multiple cut-repair cycles, dCas9-KR produces a single burst of damage, more closely resembling the type of damage experienced during acute exposure to reactive oxygen species or environmental toxins. dCas9-KR is a promising system to induce DNA damage and measure site-specific repair kinetics at clustered DNA lesions.",

    "abstract": "Chronic pain is a global healthcare problem with a huge societal impact. Its management remains unsatisfactory, with no single treatment clinically approved in most cases. In this study we use an in vitro experimental model of erythromelalgia consisting of sensory neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells obtained from a patient (carrying the mutation F1449V) and a control subject. We combine neurophysiology and computational modelling to focus on the Nav1.7 voltage gated sodium channel, which acts as an amplifier of the receptor potential in nociceptive neurons and plays a critical role in erythromelalgia due to gain of function mutations causing the channel to open with smaller depolarisations.\n\nUsing multi-electrode array (extracellular) recordings, we found that the scorpion toxin OD1 increases the excitability of sensory neurons in cultures obtained from the control donor, evidenced by increased spontaneous spike rate and amplitude. In erythromelalgia cultures, the application of the Nav1.7 blocker PF-05089771 effectively stopped spontaneous firing. These results, which are in accordance with current clamp and voltage clamp recordings reported in the literature, are explained with a conductance-based computational model of a single human nociceptive neuron. The disease was simulated through a decrease of the Nav1.7 half activation voltage, which decreased the rheobase and increased the response to supra threshold depolarizing currents. This enhanced response could be successfully supressed by blocking the Nav1.7 channels. The painful effects of OD1 were simulated through a slower establishment and a quicker removal of Nav1.7 inactivation, reproducing the effects of the toxin on the spike frequency and amplitude. Our model simulations suggest that the increase in extracellular spike amplitude observed in the MEA after OD1 treatment can be due mainly to a slope increase in the ascending phase of the intracellular spike caused by impaired inactivation gating.",

    "abstract": "Schistosomiasis is a serious parasitic infection caused by Schistosoma. The parasite deposits eggs in the host liver, causing inflammation that activates hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which leads to liver fibrosis. Currently, there is no effective therapy for liver fibrosis; thus, treatments are urgently needed. Therefore, in the present study, mice infected with Schistosoma japonicum were treated with JQ-1, a small-molecule bromodomain inhibitor with reliable anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory activities. The fibrotic area of the liver measured by computer-assisted morphometric analysis and the expression levels of the cytoskeletal protein alpha smooth muscle actin (-SMA) and of collagen assessed by quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry were significantly decreased in the liver following JQ-1 treatment compared with vehicle-treated controls. Total RNA was extracted from the liver of JQ-1-treated Schistosoma-infected mice for RNA-sequencing analysis. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses indicated that JQ-1 affected biological processes and the expression of cellular components known to play key roles in HSC transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts. In vitro treatment with JQ-1 of JS-1 cells, a mouse HSC line, indicated that JQ-1 significantly inhibited JS-1 proliferation but had no effect on JS-1 activity, senescence, or apoptosis. Western blot results showed that JQ-1 inhibited the expression of phosphorylated JAK2 and phosphorylated STAT3 without altering expression levels of these non-phosphorylated proteins. Taken together, these findings suggested that JQ-1 treatment ameliorated S. japonicum egg-induced liver fibrosis, at least in part, by suppressing HSC activation and proliferation through the inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 signaling. These results lay a foundation for the development of novel approaches to treat and control liver fibrosis caused by S. japonicum.\n\nAuthor summaryWhen a host is infected with Schistosoma, a common parasite that affects more than a million people and hundreds of thousands of livestock, the parasite deposits eggs in the liver of the host. The eggs lead to liver inflammation, which activates stellate cells in the liver. These stellate cells generate most of the excessive extracellular matrix that replaces healthy liver parenchyma with fibrous tissue, causing liver fibrosis. Schistosoma japonicum causes the most severe liver damage of all the schistosome parasites. Therefore, inhibiting the activation of the liver stellate cells and removing the activated stellate cells are key strategies for treating liver fibrosis caused by this parasite. JQ-1 is a potent inhibitor of the BET family of bromodomain proteins and is structurally similar to inhibitors being tested in clinical trials for various types of cancers. Here we found that administering JQ-1 to mice infected with S. japonicum decreased the degree of liver fibrosis. JQ-1 inhibited the activation and proliferation of liver stellate cells by blocking the phosphorylation and thus the activation of JAK2 and STAT3 to achieve its therapeutic effects. Thus, this study provides insights into the development of new therapeutic strategies for Schistosoma-induced liver fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Bartonella bacilliformis, the etiological agent of Carrions disease, is a Gram-negative, facultative intracellular alphaproteobacterium. Carrions disease is an emerging but neglected tropical illness endemic to Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador. B. bacilliformis is spread between humans through the bite of female phlebotomine sand flies. As a result, the pathogen encounters significant and repeated environmental shifts during its life cycle, including changes in pH and temperature. In most bacteria, small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) serve as effectors that may post-transcriptionally regulate the stress response to such changes. However, sRNAs have not been characterized in B. bacilliformis, to date. We therefore performed total RNA-sequencing analyses on B. bacilliformis grown in vitro then shifted to one of ten distinct conditions that simulate various environments encountered by the pathogen during its life cycle. From this, we identified 160 sRNAs significantly expressed under at least one of the conditions tested. sRNAs included the highly-conserved tmRNA, 6S RNA, RNase P RNA component, SRP RNA component, ffH leader RNA, and the alphaproteobacterial sRNAs r45 and speF leader RNA. In addition, 153 other potential sRNAs of unknown function were discovered. Northern blot analysis was used to confirm the expression of eight novel sRNAs. We also characterized a Bartonella bacilliformis group I intron (BbgpI) that disrupts an un-annotated tRNACCUArg gene and determined that the intron splices in vivo and self-splices in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrated the molecular targeting of Bartonella bacilliformis small RNA 9(BbsR9) to transcripts of the ftsH, nuoF, and gcvT genes, in vitro.\n\nAuthor summaryB. bacilliformis is a bacterial pathogen that is transmitted between humans by phlebotomine sand flies. Bacteria often express sRNAs to fine-tune the production of proteins involved in a wide array of biological processes. We cultured B. bacilliformis in vitro under standard conditions then shifted the pathogen for a period of time to ten distinct environments, including multiple temperatures, pH levels, and infections of human blood and human vascular endothelial cells. After RNA-sequencing, a manual transcriptome search identified 160 putative sRNAs, including seven highly-conserved sRNAs and 153 novel potential sRNAs. We then characterized two of the novel sRNAs, BbgpI and BbsR9. BbgpI is a group I intron (ribozyme) that self-splices and disrupts an unannotated gene coding for a transfer RNA (tRNACCUArg). BbsR9 is an intergenic sRNA expressed under conditions that simulate the sand fly. We found that BbsR9 targets transcripts of the ftsH, nuoF, and gcvT genes. Furthermore, we determined the specific sRNA-mRNA interactions responsible for BbsR9 binding to its target mRNAs through in vitro mutagenesis and binding assays.",

Previous research reported that colours could affect reading skills as an important factor of the emotional and physiological state of the body and that reading is one of the most important processes in the maturation of children. The aim of the study was to assess developmental differences between second and third grade students of elementary school and to evaluate differences in electroencephalography (EEG), ocular, electrodermal activities (EDA) and heart rate variability (HRV). In the experiment, the responses of 24 children (12 second and 12 third grade students) to different background and overlay colours were summarized using EEG, eye tracking, EDA and HRV signals. Our findings showed a decreasing trend with age regarding EEG power bands (Alpha, Beta, Delta, Theta) and lower scores of reading duration and eye-tracking measures in younger children compared to older children. As shown in the results, HRV parameters showed higher scores in 12 background and overlay colours among second than third grade students which is linearly correlated to the level of stress and readable from EDA measures as well. The existing study showed the calming effect on second graders in turquoise and blue background colours. Considering other colours separately for each parameter, we assumed that there are no systematic differences in Reading duration, EEG power band, Eye-tracking and EDA measures.",

    "abstract": "Plant immunity against pathogens and pests is comprised of complex mechanisms orchestrated by signaling pathways regulated by plant hormones [Salicylic acid (SA) and Jasmonic acid (JA)]. Investigations of plant immune response to phytopathogens and phloem-feeders have revealed that SA plays a critical role in reprogramming of the activity and/or localization of transcriptional regulators via post-translational modifications. We explored the contributing effects of herbivory by a phytopathogen vector [Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri] and pathogen [Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas)] infection on response of sweet orange [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck] using manipulative treatments designed to mimic the types of infestations/infections that citrus growers experience when cultivating citrus in the face of Huanglongbing (HLB) disease. A one-time (7 d) inoculation access period with CLas-infected vectors caused SA-associated upregulation of PR-1, stimulating defense response after a long period of infection without herbivory (270 and 330 days). In contrast, while repeated (monthly)  pulses of 7 d psyllid feeding injury stimulated immunity in CLas-infected citrus by increasing [SA] in leaves initially (up to 120 d), long-term (270 and 330 days) repeated herbivory caused [SA] to decrease coincident with upregulation of genes associated with SA metabolism (BMST and DMR6). Similarly, transcriptional responses and metabolite (SA and its analytes) accumulation in citrus exposed to a continuously reproducing population of D. citri exhibited a transitory upregulation of genes associated with SA signaling at 120 days and a posterior downregulation after long-term psyllid (adults and nymphs) feeding (270 and 330 days). Herbivory played an important role in regulation of SA accumulation in mature leaves of C. sinensis, whether or not those trees were coincidentally infected with CLas. Our results indicate that prevention of feeding injury inflicted by D. citri from the tritrophic interaction may allow citrus plants to better cope with the consequences of CLas infection, highlighting the importance of vector suppression as a component of managing this cosmopolitan disease.\n\nAuthor SummaryWe explored tritrophic interactions among an insect vector (Diaphorina citri) - phytopathogen (Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus) - and cultivated fruit crop [sweet orange, Citrus sinensis (L) Osbeck]. Transcriptional and metabolic responses of plants were analyzed over an extended time-course of disease progression after various frequencies of herbivore feeding and durations of pathogen infection using manipulative treatments designed to mimic the types of infestations/infections that citrus growers experience when cultivating citrus in the presence of the devastating citrus disease, huanglongbing. We found that in the absence of coincident psyllid feeding damage, citrus trees could mount a defense response against the pathogen by activating the salicylic acid (SA) pathway. Repeated, monthly  pulses of herbivory led to pronounced stimulation of SA transcription that was coincident with diminished pathogen titers in plants. Although insect injury initially activated SA-dependent defense responses, continuous and/or long-term ([&ge;] 270 d) herbivory shut down PR-1-dependent defense responses against the pathogen. Our results provide a mechanism explaining how vector suppression contributes to maintaining health of cultivated citrus in areas where huanglongbing is endemic. Our results also point to specific gene targets that may yield novel genotypes expressing tolerance against CLas after appropriate manipulations.",
