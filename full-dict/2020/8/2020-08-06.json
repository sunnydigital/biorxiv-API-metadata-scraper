    "abstract": "AimExercise elicits a range of adaptive responses in skeletal muscle that include changes in mRNA expression. To better understand the health benefits of exercise training, it is essential to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of skeletal muscle adaptations to exercise. However, most studies have assessed the molecular events at a few convenient time points within a short time frame post exercise, and the variations of gene expression kinetics have not been addressed systematically.\n\nMethodMuscle biopsies were collected from nine participants at baseline and six time points (0, 3, 9, 24, 48, and 72 h) following a session of high-intensity interval exercise. We assessed the mRNA content of 23 gene isoforms from the muscle samples.\n\nResultThe temporal patterns of target gene expression were highly variable and the mRNA contents detected were largely dependent on the muscle sample timing. The maximal levels of mRNA content of all tested target genes were observed between 3 to 48 h post exercise.\n\nConclusionOur findings highlight a critical gap in knowledge regarding the molecular response to exercise, where the use of a few time points within a short period after exercise has led to an incomplete understanding of the molecular responses to exercise. The timing of muscle sampling for individual studies needs to be carefully chosen based on existing literature and preliminary analysis of the molecular targets of interest. We propose that a comprehensive time-course analysis on the exercise-induced transcriptional response in humans will significantly benefit the field of exercise molecular biology.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of the plant immune system is important for controlling the specificity and amplitude of responses to pathogens and in preventing growth-inhibiting autoimmunity that leads to reductions in plant fitness. In previous work, we reported that SRFR1, a negative regulator of effector-triggered immunity, interacts with SNC1 and EDS1. When SRFR1 is non-functional in the Arabidopsis accession Col-0, SNC1 levels increase, causing a cascade of events that lead to autoimmunity phenotypes. Previous work showed that some members of the transcriptional co-repressor family TOPLESS interact with SNC1 to repress negative regulators of immunity. Therefore, to explore potential connections between SRFR1 and TOPLESS family members, we took a genetic approach that examined the effect of each TOPLESS member in the srfr1 mutant background. The data indicated that an additive genetic interaction exists between SRFR1 and two members of the TOPLESS family, TPR2 and TPR3, as demonstrated by increased stunting and elevated PR2 expression in srfr1 tpr2 and srfr1 tpr2 tpr3 mutants. Furthermore, the tpr2 mutation intensifies autoimmunity in the auto-active snc1-1 mutant, indicating a novel role of these TOPLESS family members in negatively regulating SNC1-dependent phenotypes. This negative regulation can also be reversed by overexpressing TPR2 in the srfr1 tpr2 background. Thus, this work uncovers diverse functions of individual members of the TOPLESS family in Arabidopsis and provides evidence for the additive effect of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of SNC1.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe immune system is a double-edged sword that affords organisms with protection against infectious diseases but can also lead to negative effects if not properly controlled. Plants only possess an innate antimicrobial immune system that relies on rapid upregulation of defenses once immune receptors detect the presence of microbes. Plant immune receptors known as resistance proteins play a key role in rapidly triggering defenses if pathogens breach other defenses. A common model of unregulated immunity in the reference Arabidopsis variety Columbia-0 involves a resistance gene called SNC1. When the SNC1 protein accumulates to unnaturally high levels or possesses auto-activating mutations, the visible manifestations of immune overactivity include stunted growth and low biomass and seedset. Consequently, expression of this gene and accumulation of the encoded protein are tightly regulated on multiple levels. Despite careful study the mechanisms of SNC1 gene regulation are not fully understood. Here we present data on members of the well-known TOPLESS family of transcriptional repressors. While previously characterized members were shown to function in indirect activation of defenses, TPR2 and TPR3 are shown here to function in preventing high defense activity. This study therefore contributes to the understanding of complex regulatory processes in plant immunity.",

    "abstract": "Barley yellow mosaic disease is caused by Barley yellow mosaic virus and Barley mild mosaic virus, and leads to severe yield losses in barley (Hordeum vulgare) in Central Europe and East-Asia. Several resistance loci are used in barley breeding. However, cases of resistance-breaking viral strains are known, raising concerns about the durability of those genes. Rym14Hb is a dominant major resistance gene on chromosome 6HS, originating from barleys secondary genepool wild relative Hordeum bulbosum. As such, the resistance mechanism may represent a case of non-host resistance, which could enhance its durability. A susceptible barley variety and a resistant H. bulbosum introgression line were crossed to produce a large F2 mapping population (n=7,500), to compensate for a ten-fold reduction in recombination rate compared to intraspecific barley crosses. After high-throughput genotyping, the Rym14Hb locus was assigned to a 2Mbp telomeric interval on chromosome 6HS. The co-segregating markers developed in this study can be used for marker-assisted introgression of this locus into barley elite germplasm with a minimum of linkage drag.",

    "abstract": "Computer-aided rational vaccine design (RVD) and synthetic pharmacology are rapidly developing fields that leverage existing datasets for developing compounds of interest. Computational proteomics utilizes algorithms and models to probe proteins for functional prediction. A potentially strong target for such a computational approach is autoimmune antibodies which are the result of broken tolerance in the immune system where it cannot distinguish \"self\" from \"non-self\" resulting in attack of its own structures (proteins and DNA, mainly). The information on structure, function and pathogenicity of autoantibodies may assist in engineering RVD against autoimmune diseases. Current computational approaches exploit large datasets curated with extensive domain knowledge, most of which include the need for many computational resources and have been applied indirectly to problems of interest for DNA, RNA, and monomer protein binding. Here, we present a novel method for discovering potential binding sites. We employed long short-term memory (LSTM) models trained on FASTA primary sequences directly to predict protein binding in DNA-binding hydrolytic antibodies (abzymes). We also employed CNN models applied to the same dataset. While the CNN model outperformed the LSTM on the primary task of binding prediction, analysis of internal model representations of both models showed that the LSTM models highlighted sub-sequences that were more strongly correlated with sites known to be involved in binding. These results demonstrate that analysis of internal processes of recurrent neural network models may serve as a powerful tool for primary sequence analysis.",

    "abstract": "Differentiation of endometrial fibroblasts into specialized decidual cells controls embryo implantation and transforms the cycling endometrium into a semi-permanent, immune-protective matrix that accommodates the placenta throughout pregnancy. This process starts during the midluteal phase of the menstrual cycle with decidual transformation of perivascular cells (PVC) surrounding the terminal spiral arterioles and endometrial stromal cells (EnSC) underlying the luminal epithelium. Decidualization involves extensive cellular reprogramming and acquisition of a secretory phenotype, essential for coordinated placental trophoblast invasion. Secreted metabolites are an emerging class of signalling molecules. Here, we used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to characterise the dynamic changes in metabolite secretion (exometabolome) of primary PVC and EnSC decidualized over 8 days. We identified 79 annotated metabolites differentially secreted upon decidualization, including prostaglandin, sphingolipid, and hyaluronic acid metabolites. Secreted metabolites encompassed 21 metabolic pathways, most prominently glycerolipid and pyrimidine metabolism. Although temporal exometabolome changes were comparable between decidualizing PVC and EnSC, 32 metabolites were differentially secreted across the decidualization time-course. Further, targeted metabolomics demonstrated a conspicuous difference in xanthine secretion between decidualized PVC and EnSC. Taken together, our findings indicate that the metabolic footprints generated by different decidual subpopulations encode spatiotemporal information that may be important for optimal embryo implantation.",

    "abstract": "Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) caused by Dabie bandavirus (formerly SFTS virus [SFTSV]) is an emerging hemorrhagic infectious disease with a high case-fatality rate. One of the best strategies for preventing SFTS is to develop a vaccine, which is expected to induce both humoral and cellular immunity. We applied a highly attenuated but still immunogenic vaccinia virus strain LC16m8 (m8) as a recombinant vaccine for SFTS. Recombinant m8s expressing SFTSV nucleoprotein (m8-N), envelope glycoprotein precursor (m8-GPC), and both N and GPC (m8-N+GPC) in the infected cells were generated. Both m8-GPC- and m8-N+GPC-infected cells were confirmed to produce SFTSV-like-particles (VLP) in vitro, and the N was incorporated in the VLP produced by the infection of cells with m8-N+GPC. Specific antibodies to SFTSV were induced in mice inoculated with each of the recombinant m8s, and the mice were fully protected from lethal challenge with SFTSV at both 103 TCID50 and 105 TCID50. In mice that had been immunized with vaccinia virus strain Lister in advance of m8-based SFTSV vaccine inoculation, protective immunity against the SFTSV challenge was also conferred. The pathological analysis revealed that mice immunized with m8-GPC or m8-N+GPC did not show any histopathological changes without any viral antigen-positive cells, whereas the control mice showed focal necrosis with inflammatory infiltration with SFTSV antigen-positive cells in tissues after SFTSV challenge. The passive serum transfer experiments revealed that sera collected from mice inoculated with m8-GPC or m8-N+GPC but not with m8-N conferred protective immunity against lethal SFTSV challenge in naive mice. On the other hand, the depletion of CD8-positive cells in vivo did not abrogate the protective immunity conferred by m8-based SFTSV vaccines. Based on these results, the recombinant m8-GPC and m8-N+GPC were considered promising vaccine candidates for SFTS.\n\nAuthor SummarySevere fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging viral hemorrhagic fever with a high case-fatality rate (approximately 5% to >40%). Indigenous SFTS has been reported in China, Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam. Thus, the development of an effective vaccine for SFTS is urgently needed. Vaccinia virus (VAC) was previously used as a vaccine for smallpox. Unfortunately, after these strains, the so-called second generation of VAC used during the eradication campaign was associated with severe adverse events, and the third generation of VAC strains such as LC16m8 (m8) and modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) was established. m8 is confirmed to be highly attenuated while still maintaining immunogenicity. m8 is licensed for use in healthy people in Japan. At the present time, approximately 100,000 people have undergone vaccination with m8 without experiencing any severe postvaccine complications. At present, third-generation VAC strains are attractive for a recombinant vaccine vector, especially for viral hemorrhagic infectious diseases, such as Ebola virus disease, Lassa fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and SFTS. We investigated the practicality of an m8-based recombinant vaccine for SFTS as well as other promising recombinant VAC-based vaccines for viral hemorrhagic infectious diseases.",

    "abstract": "Non-symbolic number changes produce transient Event Related Potentials over parietal electrodes, while numerosity effects measured with Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) appear to originate in occipital cortex. We hypothesized that the stimulation rates used in previous SSVEP studies may be too rapid to drive parietal numerosity mechanisms. Here we recorded SSVEPs and behavioral reports over a slower range of temporal frequencies than previously used. Isoluminant dot stimuli updated at a consistent \"carrier\" frequency (3-6 Hz) while periodic changes in numerosity (e.g. 8[-&gt;]5) formed an even slower \"oddball\" frequency (0.5-1 Hz). Each numerosity oddball condition had a matched control condition where the number of dots did not change. Carrier frequencies induced SSVEPs with midline occipital topographies that did not differentiate the presence or absence of numerosity oddballs. By contrast, SSVEPs at oddball frequencies had parietal topographies and responded more strongly when oddballs were present. Consistent with our hypothesis, numerosity effects were stronger at slower stimulation rates. In a second study, the numerosity change was either supra-threshold (e.g. 8[-&gt;]5 dots) or near the threshold required for detecting numerosity changes (e.g. 8[-&gt;]9 dots). We found robust parietal responses for the supra-threshold case only, indicating a numerical distance effect. A third study replicated the parietal oddball SSVEP effect across four distinct suprathreshold numerosity-change conditions and showed that number change direction does not influence the effect. These findings show that SSVEP oddball paradigms can probe parietal computations of abstract numerosity, and may provide a rapid, portable approach to quantifying number sense within educational settings.",

    "abstract": "Background: It is well established that proprioception (position sense) is important for motor control, yet its role in motor learning and associated plasticity is not well understood. We previously demonstrated that motor skill learning is associated with enhanced proprioception and changes in sensorimotor neurophysiology. However, the neural substrates mediating these effects are unclear. Objective: To determine whether suppressing activity in the cerebellum and somatosensory cortex (S1) affects proprioceptive changes associated with motor skill learning. Methods: 54 healthy young adults practiced a skill involving visually-guided 2D reaching movements through an irregular-shaped track using a robotic manipulandum with their right hand. Proprioception was measured using a passive two-alternative choice task before and after motor practice. Continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), was delivered over S1 or the cerebellum (CB) at the end of training for two consecutive days. We compared group differences (S1, CB, Sham) in proprioception and motor skill, quantified by a speed-accuracy function, measured on a third consecutive day (retention). Results: As shown previously, the Sham group demonstrated enhanced proprioceptive sensitivity after training and at retention. The S1 group had impaired proprioceptive function at retention through online changes during practice, whereas the CB group demonstrated offline decrements in proprioceptive function. All groups demonstrated motor skill learning, however, the magnitude of learning differed between the CB and Sham groups, consistent with a role for the cerebellum in motor learning. Conclusion: Overall, these findings suggest that the cerebellum and S1 are important for distinct aspects of proprioceptive changes during skill learning.",

Here, we integrate data from HSC fate mapping and cell-cycle-dependent labeling through mathematical inference and thus gain insight into how HSCs coordinate self-renewal with differentiation. We find that most HSC divisions in adult mice are symmetric self-renewing, replacing HSCs lost by direct differentiation and death, and slowly expanding the HSC population. This expansion maintains constant HSC output to multipotent progenitors (MPPs), despite declining HSC differentiation rate with age. We identify a linear hierarchy of differentiation states between tip HSCs and MPPs, where Tie2-driven HSC fate mapping fully covers the progression of the differentiating cells. A turning point from self-renewal to accelerated cell differentiation occurs between early-stage and late-stage MPPs, just before lineage differentiation becomes manifest in single-cell transcriptomes. This stem cell hierarchy precedes lineage differentiation and may limit mutation accumulation in the hematopoietic system.",

    "abstract": "A viral etiology of Sea Star Wasting Syndrome (SSWS) has been largely explored using metagenomics leading to the conclusion that a densovirus is the predominant DNA virus associated with this syndrome, and, thus, the most promising viral candidate pathogen. Single-stranded DNA viruses are however highly diverse and pervasive among eukaryotic organisms which we hypothesize may confound the association between densoviruses and SSWS in sea stars. To test this hypothesis and assess the association of densoviruses to SSWS, we compiled past metagenomic data with new metagenomic-derived viral genomes from sea stars collected from Antarctica, California, Washington, and Alaska. We used 179 publicly available sea star transcriptomes to complement our approaches for densovirus discovery. Lastly, we focus the study to SSaDV, the first sea star densovirus discovered, by documenting its biogeography and putative tissue tropism. Transcriptomes contained mostly endogenized densovirus elements similar to the NS1 gene, while >30 complete and near-complete densoviral genomes were recovered from viral metagenomes. SSaDV was associated with nearly all tested species from southern California to Alaska, and in contrast to previous work, we show SSaDV is one genotype among a high diversity of densoviruses present in sea stars across the west coast of the United States and globally that are commonly associated with grossly normal (i.e. healthy or asymptomatic) animals. The diversity and ubiquity of these viruses in wild sea stars confounds the original hypothesis that one densovirus was the etiologic agent of SSWD.\n\nImportanceThe primary interest in sea star densoviruses, specifically SSaDV, has been their association with Sea Star Wasting Syndrome (SSWS), a disease that has decimated sea star populations across the west coast of the United States since 2013. The association of SSaDV to SSWS was originally drawn from metagenomic analyses concluding that it was (1) the only densovirus present in the metagenomic data and (2) the most likely viral candidate based on representation in symptomatic sea stars. We reassessed the original metagenomic data with additional genomic datasets and found that SSaDV was one of ten densoviruses present in the original dataset and was no more represented in symptomatic sea stars than in asymptomatic sea stars. Instead, SSaDV appears to be a widespread, generalist virus that exists among a large diversity of densoviruses present in sea star populations.",

    "abstract": "Infectious diseases and invasive species are strong drivers of biological systems that may interact to shift plant community composition. Disease and invasion can each directly suppress native populations, but variation in responses among native species to disease, invasion, and their combined effects are not well characterized. Here, we quantified the responses of three native North American grass species to experimental inoculation with the fungal pathogen Bipolaris gigantea, which has recently emerged in populations of the invasive grass Microstegium vimineum, causing leaf spot disease. In a greenhouse experiment, we examined the direct effects of disease on the native species and the indirect effects of disease on the native species through altered competition with M. vimineum, which was planted at a range of densities. Pathogen inoculation directly affected each of the three native species in unique ways, by increasing, decreasing, or not changing their biomass relative to mock inoculation. Higher M. vimineum densities, however, reduced the biomass of all three native species, regardless of inoculation treatment, suggesting that disease had no indirect effects through altered competition. In addition, competition with M. vimineum suppressed native plant biomass to a greater extent than disease. The differential impacts of B. gigantea and the consistent impacts of M. vimineum on native species biomass suggest that disease may modify native plant community composition while plant invasion may suppress multiple native plant species in systems where these drivers co-occur.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDNA and RNA of most cellular life forms and many viruses contain an expansive repertoire of modified bases. The modified bases play diverse biological roles that include both regulation of transcription and translation, and protection against restriction endonucleases and antibiotics. Modified bases are often recognized by dedicated protein domains. However, the elaborate networks of interactions and processes mediated by modified bases are far from being completely understood.\n\nResultsWe present a comprehensive census and classification of EVE domains that belong to the PUA/ASCH domain superfamily and bind various modified bases in DNA and RNA. Prokaryotes encode two classes of EVE domain proteins, slow-evolving and fast-evolving. The slow-evolving EVE domains in -proteobacteria are embedded in a conserved operonic context that implies involvement in coupling between translation and respiration, in particular, cytochrome c biogenesis, potentially, via binding 5-methylcytosine in tRNAs. In {beta} and {gamma}-proteobacteria, the conserved associations implicate the EVE domains in the coordination of cell division, biofilm formation, and global transcriptional regulation by non-coding 6S small RNAs, which are potentially modified and bound by the EVE domains. Down-regulation of the EVE-encoding operons might cause dormancy or programmed cell death (PCD). In eukaryotes, the EVE-domain-containing THYN1-like proteins appear to inhibit PCD and regulate the cell cycle, likely, via binding 5-methylcytosine and its derivatives in DNA and/or RNA. Thus, the link between PCD and cytochrome c that appears to be universal in eukaryotes might have been inherited from the -proteobacterial, proto-mitochondrial endosymbiont and, unexpectedly, could involve modified base recognition by EVE domains. In numerous prokaryotic genomes, fast-evolving EVE domains are embedded in defense contexts, including toxin-antitoxin modules and Type IV restriction systems, all of which can also induce PCD. These EVE domains likely recognize modified bases in invading DNA molecules and target them for restriction. We additionally identified EVE-like prokaryotic Development and Cell Death (DCD) domains that are also implicated in defense functions including PCD. This function was inherited by eukaryotes but, in animals, the DCD proteins apparently were displaced by the extended Tudor family, whose partnership with Piwi-related Argonautes became the centerpiece of the piRNA system.\n\nConclusionsRecognition of modified bases in DNA and RNA by EVE-like domains appears to be an important, but until now, under-appreciated, common denominator in a variety of processes including PCD, cell cycle control, antivirus immunity, stress response and germline development in animals.",

    "abstract": "Monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages, commonly referred to as mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs), are innate immune cells capable of adopting diverse homeostatic and pathogenic phenotypes. Recent single-cell RNA-sequencing studies across many diseases in the lung have profiled this diversity transcriptionally, defining new cellular states and their association with disease. Despite these massive cellular profiling efforts, many studies have focused on defining myeloid dysfunction in specific diseases without identifying common pan-disease trends in the mononuclear phagocyte compartment within the lung. To address these gaps in our knowledge, we collate, process, and analyze 561,390 cellular transcriptomes from 12 studies of the human lung across multiple human diseases. We develop a computational framework to identify and compare dominant gene markers and gene expression programs and characterize MNP diversity in the lung, proposing a conserved dictionary of gene sets. Utilizing this reference, we efficiently identify disease-associated and rare MNP populations across multiple diseases and cohorts. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of this dictionary in characterizing a recently published dataset of bronchoalveolar lavage cells from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls which further reveal novel transcriptional shifts directly relatable to other diseases in the lung. These results underline conserved MNP transcriptional programs in lung disease, provide an immediate reference for characterizing the landscape of lung MNPs and establish a roadmap to dissecting MNP transcriptional complexity across tissues.",

    "abstract": "The 2014-2016 Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in the Americas resulted in large deposits of next-generation sequencing data from clinical samples. This resource was mined to identify emerging mutations and trends in mutations as the outbreak progressed over time. Information on transmission dynamics, prevalence and persistence of intra-host mutants, and the position of a mutation on a protein were then used to prioritize 544 reported mutations based on their ability to impact ZIKV phenotype. Using this criteria, six mutants (representing naturally occurring mutations) were generated as synthetic infectious clones using a 2015 Puerto Rican epidemic strain PRVABC59 as the parental backbone. The phenotypes of these naturally occurring variants were examined using both cell culture and murine model systems. Mutants had distinct phenotypes, including changes in replication rate, embryo death, and decreased head size. In particular, a NS2B mutant previously detected during in vivo studies in rhesus macaques was found to cause lethal infections in adult mice, abortions in pregnant females, and increased viral genome copies in both brain tissue and blood of female mice. Additionally, mutants with changes in the region of NS3 that interfaces with NS5 during replication displayed reduced replication in the blood of adult mice. This analytical pathway, integrating both bioinformatic and wet lab experiments, provides a foundation for understanding how naturally occurring single mutations affect disease outcome and can be used to predict the of severity of future ZIKV outbreaks.\n\nAuthor summaryTo determine if naturally occurring individual mutations in the Zika virus epidemic genotype effect viral virulence or replication rate in vitro or in vivo, we generated an infectious clone representing the epidemic genotype of stain Puerto Rico, 2015. Using this clone, six mutants were created by changing nucleotides in the genome to cause one to two amino acid substitutions in the encoded proteins. The six mutants we generated represent mutations that differentiated the early epidemic genotype from genotypes that were either ancestral or that occurred later in the epidemic. We assayed each mutant for changes in growth rate, and for virulence in adult mice and pregnant mice. Three of the mutants caused catastrophic embryo effects including increased embryonic death or significant decrease in head diameter. Three other mutants that had mutations in a genome region associated with replication resulted in changes in in vitro and in vivo replication rates. These results illustrate the potential impact of individual mutations in viral phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Alpha-herpesviruses establish a life-long infection in the nervous system of the affected host; while this infection is restricted to peripheral neurons in a healthy host, the reactivated virus can spread within the neuronal circuitry, such as to the brain, in compromised individuals and lead to adverse health outcomes. Pseudorabies virus (PRV), an alpha-herpesvirus, requires the viral protein Us9 to sort virus particles into axons and facilitate neuronal spread. Us9 sorts virus particles by mediating the interaction of virus particles with neuronal transport machinery. Here, we report that Us9-mediated regulation of axonal sorting also depends on the state of neuronal maturation. Specifically, the development of dendrites and axons is accompanied with proteomic changes that influence neuronal processes. Immature superior cervical ganglionic neurons (SCGs) have rudimentary neurites that lack markers of mature axons. Immature SCGs can be infected by PRV, but they show markedly reduced Us9-dependent regulation of sorting, and increased Us9-independent transport of particles into neurites. Mature SCGs have relatively higher abundances of proteins characteristic of vesicle-transport machinery. We also identify Us9-associated neuronal proteins that can contribute to axonal sorting and subsequent anterograde spread of virus particles in axons. We show that SMPD4/nsMase3, a sphingomyelinase abundant in lipid-rafts, associates with Us9 and is a negative regulator of PRV sorting into axons and neuronal spread, a potential antiviral function.\n\nAuthor SummaryViral pathogenesis often is age-dependent, with more severe outcomes for infected fetuses and neonates compared to adults. As neurons age and mature, dendrites and axons polarize with distinct functions that affect neurotropic virus replication and neuronal spread of infection. This study investigates how neuronal maturation of peripheral nervous system neurons, the site of alpha-herpesvirus life-long latency and reactivation, affects replication and neuronal spread of pseudorabies virus. Characterization of infected immature and mature primary cultures of superior cervical ganglionic neurons revealed significant differences in protein composition and cellular processes that affected the activity of Us9, a viral protein required for sorting virus particles into axons. We identified neuronal and viral proteins that interact with Us9 in immature and mature neurons. Among these, we demonstrate that SMPD4/nsMase3, a sphingomyelinase critical for membrane organization and neuronal function, regulates PRV neuronal spread by preventing capsid association with Us9-containing membranes, presenting a possible antiviral function.",

Different contexts might call for different patterns of activity modulation. For example, following stroke, alternative therapeutic strategies could involve up or down-regulation of activity in the ipsilateral motor cortex. However, effects of such strategies on activity and brain structure are unknown. In a proof of concept study in healthy individuals, we showed that fMRI neurofeedback can be used to drive activity up or down in ipsilateral motor cortex during hand movement. Given evidence for activity-dependent white matter plasticity, we also tested effects of activity modulation on white matter microstructure using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We show rapid opposing changes in corpus callosum microstructure that depend on the direction of activity modulation. Bidirectional modulation of ipsilateral motor cortex activity is therefore possible, and results not only in online changes in activity patterns, but also in changes in microstructure detectable 24 hours later.",

AMPA receptors canonically provide the fast, millisecond component of the synaptic current. However, we found that about two-thirds of principal cells in the mouse hippocampus express AMPA receptors that do not desensitize and stay active for up to half a second. These receptors are expressed at synapses with a sparse but flat spatial distribution. The resulting increase in charge transfer allows single connections to reliably trigger action potentials. Biophysical and pharmacological observations imply that slow AMPA receptors incorporate {gamma}-8 and other auxiliary proteins, and their activation lengthens individual miniature synaptic currents.

    "abstract": "The quantitative modeling of semantic representations in the brain plays a key role in understanding the neural basis of semantic processing. Previous studies have demonstrated that word vectors, which were originally developed for use in the field of natural language processing, provide a powerful tool for such quantitative modeling. However, whether semantic representations revealed by the word vector-based models actually capture our perception of semantic information remains unclear, as there has been no study explicitly examining the behavioral correlates of the modeled semantic representations. To address this issue, we compared the semantic structure of nouns and adjectives estimated from word vector-based brain models with that evaluated from human behavior. The brain models were constructed using voxelwise modeling to predict the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) response to natural movies from semantic contents in each movie scene through a word vector space. The semantic dissimilarity of word representations was then evaluated using the brain models. Meanwhile, data on human behavior reflecting the perception of semantic dissimilarity between words were collected in psychological experiments. We found a significant correlation between brain model- and behavior-derived semantic dissimilarities of words. This finding suggests that semantic representations in the brain modeled via word vectors appropriately capture our perception of word meanings.\n\nAuthor summeryWord vectors, which have been originally developed in the field of engineering (natural language processing), have been extensively leveraged in neuroscience studies to model semantic representations in the human brain.

    "abstract": "Epithelia must eliminate apoptotic cells to preserve tissue barriers and prevent inflammation [1]. Several different mechanisms exist for apoptotic clearance, including efferocytosis [2, 3] and apical extrusion [4, 5]. We found that extrusion was the first-line response to apoptosis in cultured monolayers and in zebrafish epidermis. During extrusion, the apoptotic cell elicited active lamellipodial protrusions and assembly of a contractile extrusion ring in its neighbours. Depleting E-cadherin compromised both the contractile ring and extrusion, implying that a cadherin-dependent pathway allows apoptotic cells to engage their neighbours for extrusion. We identify RhoA as the cadherin-dependent signal in the neighbour cells and show that it is activated in response to contractile tension from the apoptotic cell. This mechanical stimulus is conveyed by a Myosin VI-dependent mechanotransduction pathway that is necessary both for extrusion and to preserve the epithelial barrier when apoptosis was stimulated. Earlier studies suggested that release of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) from apoptotic cells might define where RhoA was activated. However, we found that although S1P is necessary for extrusion, its contribution does not require a localized source of S1P in the epithelium. We therefore propose a unified view of how RhoA is stimulated to engage neighbour cells for apoptotic extrusion. Here, tension-sensitive mechanotransduction is the proximate mechanism that activates RhoA specifically in the immediate neighbours of apoptotic cells, but this also must be primed by S1P in the tissue environment. Together, these elements provide a coincidence detection system that confers robustness on the extrusion response.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundControl of infestation by cosmopolitan lice (Pediculus humanus) is increasingly difficult due to the transmission of resistant parasites to pediculicides. However, since the targets for pediculicides have no been identified in human lice so far, their mechanism of action remain largely unknown. The macrocyclic lactone, ivermectin is active against a broad range of insects including human lice. Isoxazolines are a recent new chemical class targeting the {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor made of the resistant to dieldrin (RDL) subunit and exhibiting a strong insecticidal potential. Here, we addressed the pediculicidal potential of isoxazolines and deciphered the molecular targets of ivermectin and the novel ectoparasiticide lotilaner in the human body louse species Pediculus humanus humanus.\n\nMethods and findingsUsing toxicity bioassays, we showed that fipronil, ivermectin and lotilaner are efficient pediculicides on adult lice. The RDL (Phh-RDL) and glutamate-gated chloride channel subunits (Phh-GluCl) were cloned and characterized by two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Phh-RDL and Phh-GluCl formed functional homomeric receptors respectively gated by GABA and L-glutamate with EC50 values of 6.4 {micro}M and 9.3 {micro}M. Importantly, ivermectin displayed a super agonist action on Phh-Glucl whereas Phh-RDL receptors were weakly affected. Reversally, lotilaner strongly inhibited the GABA-evoked currents in Phh-RDL with an IC50 value 0.5 {micro}M, whereas it had no effect on Phh-GluCl.\n\nConclusionsWe report here for the first time the pediculicidal potential of isoxazolines and reveal the distinct mode of action of ivermectin and lotilaner on GluCl and RDL channels from human lice. These results emphasize the clear repurposing future of the isoxazoline drug class to provide new pediculicidal agents to tackle resistant-louse infestations in humans.\n\nAutorship summaryO_ST_ABSWhy was this study done?C_ST_ABSHuman cosmopolitan lice are responsible for pediculosis, which represent a significant public health concern. Resistant lice against insecticides and lack of safety of the treatments for human and environment is a growing issue worldwide. Here we investigated the efficacy on lice of the classical macrocyclic lactone drug, ivermectin, and the novel isoxazoline drug, lotilaner. This study was done to decipher their mode of action at the molecular and funtional levels in order to propose new strategies to control lice infestation.\n\nWhat did the researchers do and find?Our bioassay results indicate that ivermectin and lotilaner were potent at killing human adult lice, with lotilaner showing a higher efficacy than ivermectin. Furthermore, we identified and pharmacologically characterized the first glutamate- and GABA-gated chloride channels ever described in human lice yet. Mechanistically, our molecular biology and electrophysiology findings demonstrate that ivermectin acted preferentially at glutamate channels while lotilaner specifically targeted GABA channels.\n\nWhat do these findings mean?These results provide new insights in the understanding of the insecticide mode of action and highlight the isoxazolines as a new drug-repurposing opportunity for pest control strategies.",
