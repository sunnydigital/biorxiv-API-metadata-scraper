    "abstract": "Natural products and their analogues are often challenging to synthesise due to their complex scaffolds and embedded functional groups. Solely relying on engineering the biosynthesis of natural products may lead to limited compound diversity. Integrating synthetic biology with synthetic chemistry allows rapid access to much more diverse portfolios of xenobiotic compounds which may accelerate the discovery of new therapeutics. As a proof-of-concept, by supplementing an Escherichia coli strain expressing the violacein biosynthesis pathway with 5-bromo-tryptophan in vitro or tryptophan 7-halogenase RebH in vivo, 6 halogenated analogues of violacein or deoxyviolacein were generated, demonstrating promiscuity of the violacein biosynthesis pathway. Furthermore, 20 new derivatives were generated from 5-brominated violacein analogues via Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction directly using the crude extract without prior purification. Herein, we demonstrate a flexible and rapid approach to access diverse chemical space that can be applied to a wide range of natural product scaffolds.",

    "abstract": "BRAF-mutant melanomas are more likely than NRAS-mutant melanomas to arise in anatomical locations protected from chronic sun damage. We hypothesized that this discrepancy in tumor location is a consequence of the differential sensitivity of BRAF and NRAS-mutant melanocytes to ultraviolet light (UV)-mediated carcinogenesis. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the mutagenic consequences of a single, narrow band ultraviolet-A (UVA; 320-400nm) or ultraviolet-B (UVB; 280-320nm) exposure in mouse models predisposed to Braf- or Nras-mutant melanoma. Exposures approximated the amount of UVA or UVB energy contained in ~40 minutes of summer sunlight. Tumor onset was accelerated in all UVB-, but only half of UVA- irradiated mice as compared to unirradiated controls. Melanomas from both mouse models, harbored recurrent mutations affecting the RING domain of MAP3K1 and Actin-binding domain of Filamin A irrespective of UV status. Melanomas from UVB-irradiated, Braf-mutant mice averaged twice as many SNVs (1,025 vs. 435) and five times as many dipyrimidine variants (33.3 vs. 5.7) than tumors from similarly irradiated Nras-mutant mice. We identified a mutational signature enriched in UVB-accelerated tumors which mirrored COSMIC signatures associated with human skin cancer. Notably, this signature was enriched to a greater extent in Braf- than Nras-mutant murine melanomas. These data suggest that oncogenic BRAF may enhance UVB carcinogenesis to promote melanoma formation at anatomic sites with low or intermittent sun exposure.",

To fully characterize this preference we developed genome-wide maps of DNA uptake using both a sequence-based computational model and genomic DNA that had been sequenced after uptake by and recovery from competent Haemophilus influenzae cells. When DNA fragments were shorter than the average USS spacing of ~1000 bp, sharp peaks of uptake were centered at USS and separated by valleys with 1000-fold lower uptake. Long DNA fragments (1.5-17 kb) gave much less variation, with 90% of positions having uptake within two-fold of the mean. All detectable uptake biases arose from sequences that fit the USS uptake motif. Simulated competition predicted that, in its respiratory tract environment, H. influenzae will efficiently take up its own DNA even when human DNA is present in 100-fold excess.",

How such flattened diurnal glucocorticoid oscillations increase fat storage is unknown. Here we investigated the consequences in mice and found that flattening of glucocorticoid oscillations results not only in body weight gain, mainly due to increases in white fat depot mass, but also leads to hyperinsulinemia and fat accumulation in brown adipose tissue. A transcriptomic analysis of white and brown adipose tissues revealed that flattened glucocorticoid oscillations cause dysregulated lipid metabolism with a prominent role of the fatty acid transporter Cd36 and insulin-driven adipocyte hypertrophy. Indeed, Cd36 knockout mice are partially protected against the adverse effects of flattened GC oscillations including body weight gain and lipid accumulation in the brown and visceral white fat depots. These results show the molecular mechanisms how flattened glucocorticoid oscillations can cause obesity and diabetes.",

The elevated pre-rRNA level of T cells is also observed in both mouse heart or skin transplantation models, and in kidney transplanted patients. Importantly, T cell activation can be significantly suppressed by inhibiting NF45/NF90-dependent rDNA transcription. Amazingly, CX5461, a rDNA transcription specific inhibitor, outperformed FK506, the most commonly used immunosuppressant, both in terms of potency and off-target activity (i.e. toxicity), as demonstrated by a series of skin and heart allograft models. Collectively, this reveals NF45/NF90-mediated rDNA transcription as a novel signaling pathway essential for T cell activation and as a new target for the development of safe and effective immunosuppressants.",

    "abstract": "Coupled oscillatory circuits are ubiquitous in nervous systems. Given that most biological processes are temperature sensitive, it is remarkable that the neuronal circuits of poikilothermic animals can maintain coupling across a wide range of temperatures. Within the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the crab, Cancer borealis, the fast pyloric rhythm (~1Hz) and the slow gastric mill rhythm (~0.1Hz) are precisely coordinated at ~11{degrees}C such that there is an integer number of pyloric cycles per gastric mill cycle (integer coupling). Upon increasing temperature from 7-23{degrees}C, both oscillators showed similar temperature-dependent increases in cycle frequency, and integer coupling between the circuits was conserved. Thus, although both rhythms show temperature dependent changes in rhythm frequency, the processes that couple these circuits maintain their coordination over a wide range of temperature. Such robustness to temperature changes could be part of a toolbox of processes that enables neural circuits to maintain function despite global perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Sucrose is attractive to most species in the animal kingdom, not only because it induces a sweet taste sensation but also for its positive palatability (i.e., oromotor responses elicited by increasing sucrose concentrations). Although palatability is such an important sensory attribute, it is currently unknown which cell types encode and modulate sucroses palatability. Studies in mice have shown that activation of GABAergic LHAVgat+ neurons evokes voracious eating; however, it is not known whether these neurons would be driving consumption by increasing palatability. Using optrode recordings, we measured sucroses palatability while VGAT-ChR2 transgenic mice performed a brief access sucrose test. We found a subpopulation of LHAVgat+ neurons encodes palatability by increasing (or decreasing) their activity as a function of the increment in licking responses evoked by sucrose concentrations. Optogenetic gain of function experiments, where mice were able to choose among available water, 3%, or 18% sucrose solution, uncovered that opto-stimulation of LHAVgat+ neurons consistently promoted higher intake of the most palatable stimulus (18% sucrose). In contrast, if they self-stimulated near the less palatable stimulus, some VGAT-ChR2 mice preferred water over 18% sucrose. Unexpectedly, activation of LHAVgat+ neurons increased quinine intake but only during water deprivation, since in sated animals, they failed to promote quinine intake or tolerate an aversive stimulus. Conversely, these neurons promoted overconsumption of sucrose when it was the nearest stimulus. Also, experiments with solid foods further confirmed that these neurons increased food interaction time with the most palatable food available. We conclude that LHAVgat+ neurons increase the drive to consume, but it is potentiated by the palatability and proximity of the tastant.",

    "abstract": "Class-II fumarases (Fumarate Hydratase, FH) are dual targeted enzymes, occurring in the mitochondria and cytosol of all eukaryotes. They are essential components in the DNA damage response (DDR) and more specifically, protecting cells from DNA double strand breaks. Similarly, the Gram-positive Bacterium Bacillus subtilis Class-II fumarase, in addition to its role in the TCA cycle, also participates in the DDR. Escherichia coli, harbors three fumarase genes; Class-I fumA and fumB and Class-II fumC. Notably, Class-I fumarases, show no sequence similarity to Class-II fumarases and are of different evolutionary origin. Strikingly, here we show that E. coli fumarase functions are distributed between Class-I fumarases which participate in the DDR, and the Class-II fumarase which participates in respiration. In E. coli, we discover that the signaling molecule, alpha-ketoglutarate (-KG), has a novel function, complementing DNA damage sensitivity of fum null mutants. Excitingly, we identify the E. coli -KG dependent DNA repair enzyme AlkB, as the target of this interplay of metabolite signaling. In addition to -KG, fumarate (fumaric acid) is shown to affect DNA damage repair on two different levels, first by directly inhibiting the DNA damage repair enzyme AlkB demethylase activity, both in vitro and in vivo (countering -KG). The second is a more global effect on transcription, as fum null mutants exhibit a decrease in transcription of key DNA damage repair genes. Together these results show evolutionary adaptable metabolic signaling of the DDR, in which fumarases and different metabolites are recruited regardless of the evolutionary enzyme Class preforming the function.\n\nSignificance StatementClass-II fumarases have been shown to participate in cellular respiration and the DNA damage response. Here we show, for the first time, that in the model prokaryote, Escherichia coli, which harbors both Class-I and Class-II fumarases, it is the Class-I fumarases that participate in DNA damage repair by a mechanism which is different than those described for other fumarases. Strikingly, this mechanism employs a novel signaling molecule, alpha-ketoglutarate (-KG), and its target is the DNA damage repair enzyme AlkB. In addition, we show that fumarase precursor metabolites, fumarate and succinate, can inhibit the -KG-dependent DNA damage repair enzyme, AlkB, both in vitro and in vivo. This study provides a new perspective on the function and evolution of metabolic signaling.",

    "abstract": "The interaction of the structural VP3 polypeptide of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) with virus-encoded dsRNA is essential both for the assembly of ribonucleoprotein complexes responsible for genome transcription and replication and for the evasion of hosts antiviral responses. Surface plasmon resonance analysis allowed us to determine the kinetic constants of the VP3-dsRNA interaction as well as to map the VP3 dsRNA bipartite dsRNA binding domain (dsRBD), uncovering the specific role of the previously described Patch1 and Patch2 dsRB subdomains. Here we show that the Patch1 domain plays a primary binding function while Patch2 exerts a subordinate role stabilizing VP3-dsRNA complexes. The use of a set of VP3 mutant versions facilitated the identification of K99 and K106 within Patch1 as the essential residues for the formation of VP3-dsRNA complexes. Furthermore, replacement of either one of these two residues by aspartic acid completely thwarts both evasion from hosts sensors and virus replication. Data presented here allow us to propose a VP3-dsRNA interaction model that should help to further elucidate the mechanics of IBDV morphogenesis and genome packaging as well as to better understand how VP3 counteracts recognition of virus-encoded dsRNA by specialized hosts sensors.",

    "abstract": "Penalized linear regression approaches that include an L1 term have become an important tool in statistical data analysis. One prominent example is the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso), though the class of L1 penalized regression operators also includes the fused and graphical Lasso, the elastic net, etc. Although the L1 penalty makes their objective function convex, it is not differentiable everywhere, motivating the development of proximal gradient algorithms such as Fista, the current gold standard in the literature. In this work, we take a different approach based on smoothing in a fixed parameter setting (the problem size n and number of parameters p are fixed). The methodological contribution of our article is threefold: (1) We introduce a unified framework to compute closed-form smooth surrogates of a whole class of L1 penalized regression problems using Nesterov smoothing. The surrogates preserve the convexity of the original (unsmoothed) objective functions, are uniformly close to them, and have closed-form derivatives everywhere for efficient minimization via gradient descent; (2) We prove that the estimates obtained with the smooth surrogates can be made arbitrarily close to the ones of the original (unsmoothed) objective functions, and provide explicitly computable a priori error bounds on the accuracy of our estimates; (3) We propose an iterative algorithm to progressively smooth the L1 penalty which increases accuracy and is virtually free of tuning parameters. The proposed methodology is applicable to a large class of L1 penalized regression operators, including all the operators mentioned above. Although the resulting estimates are typically dense, sparseness can be enforced again via thresholding. Using simulation studies, we compare our framework to current gold standards such as Fista, glmnet, gLasso, etc. Our results suggest that our proposed smoothing framework provides predictions of equal or higher accuracy than the gold standards while keeping the aforementioned theoretical guarantees and having roughly the same asymptotic runtime scaling.",

    "abstract": "The latency of the auditory steady-state response (ASSR) may provide valuable information regarding the integrity of the auditory system, as it could potentially reveal the presence of multiple intracerebral sources. To estimate multiple latencies from high-order ASSRs, we propose a novel two-stage procedure that consists of a nonparametric estimation method, called apparent latency from phase coherence (ALPC), followed by a heuristic sequential forward selection algorithm (SFS). Compared with existing methods, ALPC-SFS requires few prior assumptions, and is straightforward to implement for higher-order nonlinear responses to multi-cosine sound complexes with their initial phases set to zero. It systematically evaluates the nonlinear components of the ASSRs by estimating multiple latencies, automatically identifies involved ASSR components, and reports a latency consistency index (LCI). To verify the proposed method, we performed simulations for several scenarios: two nonlinear subsystems with different or overlapping outputs. We compared the results from our method with predictions from existing, parametric methods. We also recorded the EEG from ten normal-hearing adults by bilaterally presenting superimposed tones with four frequencies that evoke a unique set of ASSRs. From these ASSRs, two major latencies were found to be stable across subjects on repeated measurement days. The two latencies are dominated by low-frequency (LF) (near 40 Hz, at around 41-52 ms) and high-frequency (HF) (>80 Hz, at around 21-27 ms) ASSR components. The frontal-central (FC) brain region showed longer latencies on LF components, but shorter latencies on HF components, when compared with temporal-lobe regions. In conclusion, the proposed nonparametric ALPC-SFS method, applied to zero-phase, multi-cosine sound complexes is more suitable for evaluating embedded nonlinear systems underlying ASSRs than existing methods. It may therefore be a promising objective measure for hearing performance and auditory cortex (dys)function. The Matlab scripts for the ALPC-SFS method is available here: https://github.com/ieeeWang/ALPC-SFS-method-Matlab-scripts.",

    "abstract": "Inherited immunity is an emerging field and describes how the transfer of immunity from parents to offspring can promote progeny survival in the face of infection. The mechanisms of how inherited immunity is induced are mostly unknown. The intracellular parasite Nematocida parisii is a natural microsporidian pathogen of Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we show that N. parisii-infected worms produce primed offspring that are resistant to microsporidia infection. We find that immunity is induced in a dose dependent manner and lasts for a single generation. Intergenerational immunity prevents host cell invasion by N. parisii and also enhances survival to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Further, we show that inherited immunity is triggered by the host transcriptional response to infection, which can also be induced through maternal somatic depletion of negative regulators PALS-22 and the retinoblastoma protein ortholog LIN-35. We show that other biotic and abiotic stresses, such as viral infection and cadmium exposure, that induce a similar transcriptional response to microsporidia can also induce immunity in progeny. Our results demonstrate that distinct stimuli can induce inherited immunity to provide resistance against multiple classes of pathogens. These results show that activation of an innate immune response can provide protection against pathogens not only within a generation, but also in the next generation.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent advances in high-throughput combinatorial mutagenesis assays, the number of labeled sequences available to predict molecular functions has remained small for the vastness of the sequence space combined with the ruggedness of many fitness functions. Expressive models in machine learning (ML), such as deep neural networks (DNNs), can model the nonlinearities in rugged fitness functions, which manifest as high-order epistatic interactions among the mutational sites. However, in the absence of an inductive bias, DNNs overfit to the small number of labeled sequences available for training. Herein, we exploit the recent biological evidence that epistatic interactions in many fitness functions are sparse; this knowledge can be used as an inductive bias to regularize DNNs. We have developed a method for sparse epistatic regularization of DNNs, called the epistatic net (EN), which constrains the number of non-zero coefficients in the spectral representation of DNNs. For larger sequences, where finding the spectral transform becomes computationally intractable, we have developed a scalable extension of EN, which subsamples the combinatorial sequence space uniformly inducing a sparse-graph-code structure, and regularizes DNNs using the resulting greedy optimization method. Results on several biological landscapes, from bacterial to protein fitness functions, show that EN consistently improves the prediction accuracy of DNNs and enables them to outperform competing models which assume other forms of inductive biases. EN estimates all the higher-order epistatic interactions of DNNs trained on massive sequence spaces--a computational problem that takes years to solve without leveraging the epistatic sparsity in the fitness functions.",

    "abstract": "Animals that are competent natural reservoirs of zoonotic diseases commonly suffer little morbidity from the pathogens they persistently harbor. The mechanisms of this infection tolerance and the trade-off costs are poorly understood. We used exposure to a single dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxin as an experimental model of inflammation to compare the responses of the cricentine rodent Peromyscus leucopus, the white-footed deermouse, to that of Mus musculus, the standard laboratory model for pathogenesis studies. Four hours after injection with either LPS or saline, blood and spleen and liver tissues were collected postmortem and subjected to RNA-seq, untargeted metabolomics, and specific RT-qPCR. This was followed by analysis of differential expression at the gene, pathway, and empirical network levels. The deermice showed the same signs of sickness as the mice with LPS exposure, and in addition demonstrated comparable increases in levels of corticosterone and expression of interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor, IL-1{beta}, and acute phase reactants, including C-reactive protein. But whereas the M. musculus response to LPS was best-characterized by network analysis as cytokine-associated, the P. leucopus response was dominated by pathway terms associated with neutrophil activity. Dichotomies between the species in expression profiles of arginase 1 and nitric oxide synthase 2, as well as the ratios of IL-10 to IL-12, were consistent with a type M1 polarized macrophage response in the mice and a type M2 or alternatively-activated response in the deermice. Analysis of metabolites in the plasma and RNA in the tissues revealed differences between the two species in tryptophan metabolism during response to LPS. Two up-regulated genes in particular signified the difference between the species: Slpi (secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor) and Ibsp (integrin-binding protein sialoprotein). The latter was previously unrecognized in the context of inflammation or infection. Key RNA-seq findings in P. leucopus were replicated in a second LPS experiment with older animals, in a systemic bacterial infection model, and with cultivated fibroblasts. Taken together, the results indicate that the deermouse possesses several adaptive traits to moderate effects of inflammation and oxidative stress ensuing from infection. This seems to be at the cost of infection persistence and that is to the benefit of the pathogen.",

    "abstract": "One often observes small but measurable differences in diffraction data measured from different crystals of a single protein. These differences might reflect structural differences in the protein and potentially reflect the natural dynamism of the molecule in solution. Partitioning these mixed-state data into single-state clusters is a critical step to extract information about the dynamic behavior of proteins from hundreds or thousands of single-crystal data sets. Mixed-state data can be obtained deliberately (through intentional perturbation) or inadvertently (while attempting to measure highly redundant single-crystal data). State changes may be expressed as changes in morphology, so that a subset of the polystates may be observed as polymorphs. After mixed-state data are deliberately or inadvertently measured, the challenge is to sort the data into clusters that may represent relevant biological polystates. Here we address this problem using a simple multi-factor clustering approach that classifies each data set using independent observables in order to assign each data set to the correct location in conformation space. We illustrate this method using two independent observables (unit cell constants and intensities) to cluster mixed-state data from chymotrypsinogen (ChTg) crystals. We observe that the data populate an arc of the reaction trajectory as ChTg is converted into chymotrypsin.",

Myd88-depdnent signaling in the hematopoietic compartment was required for adjuvant activity of intranasally administered oral bacteria. In addition, we found that the oral bacteria-combined intranasal vaccine induced protective antibody response to influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 infection.

    "abstract": "Forces produced by motor proteins and microtubule dynamics within the mitotic spindle are crucial for proper chromosome segregation. In addition to linear forces, rotational forces or torques are present in the spindle, reflected in the left-handed twisted shapes of microtubule bundles that make the spindle chiral. However, the biological role and molecular origins of spindle chirality are unknown. By developing methods for measuring spindle twist, we show that spindles are most chiral near the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. To assess the role of chirality in maintaining spindle robustness under force, we compressed the spindles along their axis. This resulted in stronger left-handed twist, suggesting that the twisted shape allows for a mechanical response to forces. Inhibition or depletion of motor proteins that perform chiral stepping, Eg5/kinesin-5, Kif18A/kinesin-8, MKLP1/kinesin-6, and dynein, decreased the left-handed twist or led to right-handed twist, implying that these motors regulate the twist by rotating microtubules within their antiparallel overlaps or at the spindle pole. Right-handed twist was also observed after the depletion of the microtubule nucleator augmin, indicating its contribution to the twist through the nucleation of antiparallel bridging microtubules. The uncovered switch from left-handed to right-handed twist reveals the existence of competing mechanisms that promote twisting in opposite directions. As round spindles were more twisted than elongated ones, we infer that bending and twisting moments are generated by similar molecular mechanisms and propose a physiological role for spindle chirality in allowing the spindle to absorb mechanical load.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus nucleocapsid protein (N) controls viral genome packaging and contains numerous phosphorylation sites located within unstructured regions. Binding of phosphorylated SARS-CoV N to the host 14-3-3 protein in the cytoplasm was reported to regulate nucleocytoplasmic N shuttling. All seven isoforms of the human 14-3-3 are abundantly present in tissues vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, where N can constitute up to ~1% of expressed proteins during infection. Although the association between 14-3-3 and SARS-CoV-2 N proteins can represent one of the key host-pathogen interactions, its molecular mechanism and the specific critical phosphosites are unknown. Here, we show that phosphorylated SARS-CoV-2 N protein (pN) dimers, reconstituted via bacterial co-expression with protein kinase A, directly associate, in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, with the dimeric 14-3-3 protein, but not with its monomeric mutant. We demonstrate that pN is recognized by all seven human 14-3-3 isoforms with various efficiencies and deduce the apparent KD to selected isoforms, showing that these are in a low micromolar range. Serial truncations pinpointed a critical phosphorylation site to Ser197, which is conserved among related zoonotic coronaviruses and located within the functionally important, SR-rich region of N. The relatively tight 14-3-3/pN association can regulate nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and other functions of N via occlusion of the SR-rich region, while hijacking cellular pathways by 14-3-3 sequestration. As such, the assembly may represent a valuable target for therapeutic intervention.\n\nHighlightsSARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N) binds to all seven human 14-3-3 isoforms. This association with 14-3-3 strictly depends on phosphorylation of N. The two proteins interact in 2:2 stoichiometry and with the Kd in a M range. Affinity of interaction depends on the specific 14-3-3 isoform. Conserved Ser197-phosphopeptide of N is critical for the interaction.",

    "abstract": "ERF is a subfamily of AP2/EREBP superfamily, contained single AP2 domain. The overexpression of ERF genes steered to abiotic stress tolerance and pathogen resistance in transgenic plants. Here, a genome-wide analysis of ERF gene family within two diploid species (G. arboreum & G. raimondii) and two tetraploid species (G. barbadense, G. hirsutum) was performed. A total of 118, 120, 213, 220 genes contained sequence single AP2 domain were identified in G. arboreum, G. raimondii, G. barbadense and G. hirsutum respectively. The identified genes were unevenly distributed across 13/26 chromosomes of A and D genomes of cotton. Genome comparison revealed that segmental duplication may have played crucial roles in the expansion of the cotton ERF gene family, and tandem duplication also played a minor role. Analysis of RNA-Seq data indicated that cotton ERF gene expression levels varied across different tissues and in response to different abiotic stress. Overall, our results could provide valuable information for better understanding the evolution of cotton ERF genes and lays a foundation for future investigation in cotton.",

    "abstract": "Despite the rapid evolution of new sequencing technologies, structural variation detection remains poorly ascertained. The high discrepancy between the results of structural variant analysis programs makes it difficult to assess their performance on real datasets. Accurate simulations of structural variation distributions and sequencing data of the human genome are crucial for the development and benchmarking of new tools. In order to gain a better insight into the detection of structural variation with long sequencing reads, we created a realistic simulated model to thoroughly compare SV detection methods and the impact of the chosen sequencing technology and sequencing depth. To achieve this, we developed Sim-it, a straightforward tool for the simulation of both structural variation and long-read data. These simulations from Sim-it revealed the strengths and weaknesses for current available structural variation callers and long read sequencing platforms. Our findings were also supported by the latest structural variation benchmark set developed by the GIAB Consortium. With these findings, we developed a new method (combiSV) that can combine the results from five different SV callers into a superior call set with increased recall and precision. Both Sim-it and combiSV are open source and can be downloaded at https://github.com/ndierckx/.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGlioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a type of high-grade brain tumor known for its proliferative, invasive property, and low survival rate. Recently, with the advancement in therapeutics for tumors such as targeted therapy, individual cancer-specific biomarkers could be recognized as targets for curative purposes. This study identified six differentially expressed genes that have shown significant implications in clinical field, including FPR2, VEGFA, SERPINA1, SOX2, PBK, and ITGB3. FPR2 was of the same protein family with FPR1, and the latter has been repeatedly reported to promote motility and invasiveness of multiple tumor forms.\n\nMethodsThe gene expression profiling of 40 GBM samples and five normal samples from the TCGA database were comprehensively analyzed. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using R package and screened by enrichment analysis and examination of protein-protein interaction networks, in order to further explore the functions of DEGs with the highest association with clinical traits and to find hub genes. A qRT-PCR and Western blots were conducted to verify the results of this study.\n\nResultsOur investigation showed that FPR2, VEGFA, SERPINA1, SOX2, PBK, and ITGB3 were significantly up-regulated in GBM primary tumor compared to the control group. Functional enrichment analysis of the DEGs demonstrated that biological functions related to immune systems, cell division and cell cycle were significantly increased, which were closely related to tumor progression and development. Downstream construction of PPI network analysis indicated that FPR2 was a hub gene involved in high level of interaction with CR3 and VEGFA, which played a key role in inflammatory pathways and cellular dysfunction.\n\nConclusionFPR2, VEGFA, SERPINA1, SOX2, PBK, and ITGB3 were significantly over-expressed in primary tumor samples of GBM patients and were involved in cellular functions and pathways contributing to tumor progression. Out of these six pivotal genes, we intensively focused on FPR2, and our analysis and experimental data both suggested its efficacy as a potential biomarker, serving as an alternative immunotherapeutic target for glioblastoma multiforme.",

Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging (fcsSOFI) has been shown to extract nanoscale structure and Brownian diffusion dynamics within gels, liquid crystals, and polymers, but has limitations which hinder its wider application to more diverse, biophysically-relevant datasets. Here, we parallelize the least-squares curve fitting step on a GPU improving computation times by up to a factor of 40, implement anomalous diffusion and two-component Brownian diffusion models, and make fcsSOFI more accessible by packaging it in a user-friendly GUI. We apply fcsSOFI to simulations of the protein fibrinogen diffusing in polyacrylamide of varying matrix densities and super-resolve locations where slower, anomalous diffusion occurs within smaller, confined pores. The improvements to fcsSOFI in speed, scope, and usability will allow for the wider adoption of super-resolution correlation analysis to diverse research topics.",

    "abstract": "During the maturation step, the capsid proteins (CAs) of a retrovirus assemble into polymorphic capsids, whose acute curvature is largely determined by insertion of 12 pentamers into the hexameric lattice. Despite years of intensive research, it remains elusive how the CA switches its conformation between the quasi-equivalent pentameric and hexameric assemblies to generate the acute curvature in the capsid. Here we report the high-resolution structural model of the RSV CA T=1 capsid. By comparing with our prior model of the RSV CA tubular assembly consisting entirely of hexameric lattices, we identify that a dozen of residues are the key to dictate the incorporation of acute curvatures in the capsid assembly. They undergo large torsion angle changes, which result a 34{degrees} rotation of the C-terminal domain relative to its N-terminal domain around the flexible interdomain linker, without substantial changes of either the conformation of individual domains or the assembly contact interfaces.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=82 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/424437v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (33K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@40cf38org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e490beorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dae0c5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dac850_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Small molecule inhibitors have previously been investigated in different studies as possible therapeutics in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. In the current drug repurposing study, we identified the leukotriene (D4) receptor antagonist Montelukast as a novel agent that simultaneously targets two important drug targets of SARS-CoV-2. We initially demonstrated the dual inhibition profile of Montelukast through multiscale molecular modeling studies. Next, we characterized its effect on both targets by different in vitro experiments including the Fluorescent Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based main protease enzyme inhibition assay, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy, pseudovirus neutralization on HEK293T / hACE2, and virus neutralization assay using xCELLigence MP real time cell analyzer. Our integrated in silico and in vitro results confirmed the dual potential effect of the Montelukast both on virus entry into the host cell (Spike/ACE2) and on the main protease enzyme inhibition. The virus neutralization assay results showed that while no cytotoxicity of the Montelukast was observed at 12 M concentration, the cell index time 50 (CIT50) value was delayed for 12 hours. Moreover, it was also shown that Favipiravir, a well-known antiviral used in COVID-19 therapy, should be used by 16-fold higher concentrations than Montelukast in order to have the same effect of Montelukast. The rapid use of new small molecules in the pandemic is very important today. Montelukast, whose pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties are very well characterized and has been widely used in the treatment of asthma since 1998, should urgently be completed in clinical phase studies and if its effect is proven in clinical phase studies, it should be used against COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe endophytic microbiome may influence the ecological performance of plants, including forest trees. Various abiotic and biotic factors may shape the endophyte communities directly but also indirectly, by modifying the quality of host plants as a substrate. We hypothesized that potentially antifungal or fungistatic condensed tannins (CTs) would determine the quality of aspen (Populus tremula) leaves as a substrate for endophytic fungi. By subjecting the plants to nitrogen fertilization (N) or herbivory (H; leaf beetles) we aimed to change the internal \"chemical landscape\", especially the CT levels, in aspen leaves. We expected that this would lead to changes in the fungal community composition, in line with the predictions of heterogeneity-diversity relationship hypothesis. To test this we conducted a greenhouse study where aspen plants were subjected to N and H treatments, individually or in combination. The chemical status of the leaves was analysed using GC/MS (114 metabolites), LC/MS (11 phenolics) and UV-spectrometry (CTs) and the endophytic communities were characterized using culture-dependent sequencing. Nitrogen treatment, alone or in combination with herbivory had a suppressing effect on the concentration and within-treatment variation in the CT precursors, catechins, and resulted in similar trend also in CTs. Nitrogen increased the concentration of certain amino acids, and it also tended to increase most of the analysed sugars sugars. Herbivory had a negligible effect on chemical traits. In N-treated plants, the endophyte richness and abundance were higher than in plants exposed to H, but in general, the diversity of the culturable endophytes remaind stable despite the subtle changes in leaf chemistry.",

However, existing setups are limited in their automated measurement capabilities, primarily because sensitive and specific measurements require bulky, expensive, stand-alone instruments. Here, we present ReacSight, a generic and flexible strategy to enhance bioreactor arrays for automated measurements and reactive experiment control. On the hardware side, ReacSight leverages a pipetting robot for sample collection, handling and loading. On the software side, ReacSight provides a versatile instrument control architecture and a generic event system for reactive experiment control. ReacSight is ideally suited to integrate open-source, open-hardware components but can also accommodate closed-source, GUI-only components (e.g. cytometers). We use ReacSight to assemble a platform for cytometry-based characterization and reactive optogenetic control of parallel yeast continuous cultures. Using a dedicated bioreactor array, we showcase its capabilities on three applications. First, we achieve parallel real-time control of gene expression with light in different bioreactors. Second, we explore the impact of nutrient scarcity on fitness and cellular stress using well-controlled, high-information content competition assays. Third, we exploit nutrient scarcity to achieve dynamic control over the composition of a two-strain consortium. To illustrate the genericity of ReacSight, we also assemble an equivalent platform using the optogenetic-ready, open-hardware and commercially available Chi.Bio bioreactors.",

Here, we propose that a large synchronization fluctuation of the brain network emerging only near criticality (i.e., a balanced state between order and disorder) spontaneously creates temporal windows with distinct preferences for integrating internal information of the network and external stimuli. Using a computational model and empirical data analysis during alterations of consciousness in human, we present that synchronized and incoherent networks respectively bias toward internal and external information with specific network configurations. The network preferences are the most prominent in conscious states; however, they disrupt in altered states of consciousness. We suggest that criticality produces a functional platform of the brains capability for continuous switching between two modes, which is crucial for the emergence of consciousness.",

This demands drastic rearrangements, perhaps involving the readaptation of functionally and structurally diverse neural structures. We lack mathematical models of how this happens. We introduce a very simple model, based on self-organized maps, that provides a rationale to the clinical aftermath of the intervention, putative windows for recovery, and the origins and nature of observed thresholds for irreversible function loss.

    "abstract": "Neurons in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus discharge synchronously in a brain state-dependent manner to transfer information. Published studies have highlighted the temporal coordination of neuronal activities between the hippocampus and a cortical area, however, how the spatial extent of cortex activity relates to hippocampal activity remains largely unknown. We imaged macroscopic cortical activity while recording hippocampal local field potentials in unanesthetized GCaMP-expressing transgenic mice. We found that cortical activity elevates before and after hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SWR). SWR-associated cortical activities occurred predominantly in vision-related regions including visual, retrosplenial and prefrontal cortex. While pre-SWR cortical activities were frequently observed in awake and sleep states, post-SWR cortical activity decreased significantly in sleep. During hippocampal theta oscillation states, phase-locked oscillations of calcium activity was observed throughout the entire cortex state. Environmental effects on cortico-hippocampal dynamics were also assessed by comparing mice reared in an enriched environment (ENR) or under isolated conditions (ISO). In both SWR and theta oscillations, mice reared in an isolated condition exhibited clearer brain state-dependent dynamics than those reared in an enriched environment. Our data demonstrate that the cortex and hippocampus exhibit heterogeneous activity patterns that characterize brain states, and postnatal experience plays a significant role in modulating these patterns.\n\nSignificant StatementThe hippocampus is a center for memory formation. However, the memory formed in the hippocampus is not stored forever, but gradually transferred into the cerebral cortex. As an underlying mechanism, phase-locked synchronized activities between the cortex and hippocampus has been hypothesized. However, spatio-temporal dynamics between hippocampus and whole cortical areas remained mostly unknown. We measured cortical calcium activities with hippocampal electroencephalogram (EEG) simultaneously, and found that the activities of widespread cortical areas are temporally associated with hippocampal EEG. The cortico-hippocampal dynamics is primarily regulated by animal awake/sleep state. Even if similar EEG patters were observed, temporal dynamics between the cortex and hippocampus exhibit distinct patterns between awake and sleep period. In addition, animals postnatal experience modulates the dynamics.",

The non-invasive identification of these subdivisions is, however, difficult due to the small size of the LGN. Here we propose a method to identify these subdivisions by combining two structural MR measures: high-resolution proton-density weighted images and macromolecular tissue volume maps. We collected MRI data from 15 healthy subjects and found that the spatial organization of these subdivisions identified by our method was consistent with post-mortem histological data. Furthermore, the stimulus selectivity in these regions measured by functional MRI was consistent with physiological studies. These results suggest that macromolecular tissue volume mapping is a promising approach to evaluating the tissue properties of LGN subdivisions in living humans. This method potentially will enable neuroscientific and clinical hypotheses about the human LGN to be tested.",

    "abstract": "Clerodin (C24H34O7), a clerodane diterpenoid, is a bitter principle of Clerodendrum viscosum. The present study aimed to decipher colchicine-like actions of clerodin in terms of microtubule destabilization based mitotic abnormalities, G2-M arrest, and plant polyploidy. Purified clerodin showed increased metaphase frequency in Human Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes (HPBLs), Human Embryonic Kidney cells (HEK-293), and Allium cepa root apical meristem cells. Both squashed slide of the onion root tip and flow cytometric analysis of radish protoplast revealed a significantly increased frequency of polyploid cells. Flow cytometric analysis showed an increase in frequencies of G2-M in MCF-7 cells from 6.10 to 16.25% after clerodin (200g/mL) treatment for 24 h. Confocal microscopy imaging of tubulin in clerodin-treated MCF-7 cells revealed microtubule destabilization. Molecular docking and LIGPLOT analysis indicate that clerodin interact in the colchicine binding site, including, single hydrogen bond with Asn 101 of -tubulin. In summary, our experimental data revealed that clerodin has metaphase arresting, microtubule destabilization, and polyploidy inducing ability similar to colchicine. Molecular docking analysis revealed for the first time that clerodin and colchicine interact at the common site of tubulin residue indicating a common mechanism of action. The results also indicate similar cytotoxic potentialities of both clerodin and colchicine even though they belong to different chemical groups. Thus, clerodin may be used in place of colchicine as a plant polyploidy inducing agent in plant breeding programs in Agriculture.",

    "abstract": "One of the main assumptions of Janzens (1976) mountain passes hypothesis is that due the low overlap in temperature regimes between low and high elevations in the tropics, organisms living in high-altitude evolve narrow tolerance for colder temperatures while low-altitude species develop narrow tolerance for warmer temperatures. Some studies have questioned the generality of the assumptions and predictions of this hypothesis suggesting that other factors different to temperature gradients between low and high elevations may explain altitudinal distribution of species in the tropics. We assessed variation in tolerance to extreme temperatures (measured as critical thermal minimum (CTmin) and maximum (CTmax)) and also compared thermal breadth for populations of eight species of livebearing fishes of the genus Limia occurring in three Caribbean islands and that occupy different altitudinal distribution. Our results showed that species analyzed had significant differences in thermal limits and ranges. Generally, species distributed in high and low elevations did not differ in thermal limits and showed a wider range of thermal tolerance. However, species living in mid-elevations had narrower range of temperature tolerance. We found no significant effect of phylogeny on CTmin, CTmax and thermal ranges among species. This study did not provide evidence supporting Janzens hypothesis at a local scale since thermal tolerance and altitudinal distribution of Limia species were not related to temperature gradients expected in nature. Phylogeny also did not explain the patterns we observed. We suggest that biotic factors such as species interactions, diet specializations, and others should be taken into account when interpreting current distribution patterns of Limia species.",

    "abstract": "Throughout much of the world, winter deicing practices have led to secondary salinization of freshwater habitats, where numerous taxa are vulnerable to elevated salinity. Many amphibians are of particular concern because of their permeable skin and reliance on small ponds and pools, where salinity levels can be high. The early life-history stages of amphibians that develop in these habitats are especially sensitive to salt exposure. Larvae developing in salt-polluted environments must osmoregulate through ion exchange in gills. While salt-induced changes to the physiology of ion exchange in amphibian gills is generally understood, functionally relevant changes in gill morphology remain poorly described. Yet the structure of gills should be an important component affecting their ionoregulatory capacity, for instance in terms available surface area. Larval amphibian gills also play critical roles in gas exchange and foraging. Thus, changes in gill morphology due to salt pollution potentially affect not only osmoregulation, but also respiration and feeding. Here, we used a chronic exposure experiment to quantify the effect of salinity on larval gill morphology in populations of the wood frog (Rana sylvatica). We measured a suite of morphological traits on gill tufts, where ionoregulation and gas exchange occur, and on gill filters, which are used in feeding. Larvae raised in high salinity conditions had gill tufts with lower surface area to volume ratio, while epithelial cells on these tufts were less circular but occurred at higher densities. Gill filters showed increased spacing, which can potentially reduce their efficiency in filtering food particles. Together, these changes seem likely to diminish the ionoregulatory and respiratory capacity of gill tufts, and compromise feeding functionality of gill filters. Thus, a singular change in the aquatic environment from a widespread pollutant has the potential to generate a suite of consequences via changes in gill morphology. Critically, this suite of negative effects is likely most detrimental in salinized environments, where ionoregulatory demands are higher, which in turn should increase respiratory demands along with energy acquisition demands through foraging.\n\nSummary StatementChronic road salt exposure alters the functional morphology of gills in larval amphibians, potentially compromising osmoregulation, feeding, and respiration.",

    "abstract": "Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a most important staple food grain consumed by more than half of the worlds population. Wild rice (O. rufipogon Griff.) is considered as the immediate ancestral progenitor of cultivated rice O. sativa, evolved through the process of domestication. Most of the cultivated rice produced grains with white pericarp, but can also produce grains with brown, red and black (or purple rice) pericarp. Red rice pericarp accumulates proanthocyanidin whereas black rice contains anthocyanin, both have antioxidant activity and health benefits. Black pericarp is predicted to be regulated by alleles of three genetic loci- Kala1, Kala3, and Kala4. Recombinational and insertional genetic rearrangement in the promoter region of Kala4 is crucial for the development of black pericarp in rice grain. In the present study, we report first time in the breeding history that aromatic black rice lines were developed through interspecific hybridization and introgression in the genetic background of O. sativa cv. Badshabhog, Chenga and Ranjit. Badshabhog and Ranjit is white grain rice but Chenga is red rice category. Common Asian wild rice O. rufipogon is used as donor parent (red grain) and source of black rice gene. Several possible genetic explanations have come up for the creation of black rice pericarp in the progeny lines. Possible reason may be the rearrangement and insertion of LINE1 in the promoter region of Kala4 allele through recombination mechanism leading to ectopic expression of Kala4 gene for the accumulation of anthocyanin and resulted in black rice formation. Other genes and regulatory factors may be induced and become functional to produce black pericarp. Black pericarp colour appeared in F2 populations in the wide crosses (Badshabhog x O. rufipogon and Chenga x O. rufipogon) but not in the cross with (Ranjit x O. rufipogon). Black pericarp trait inherited in F4 and F5 population with segregation phenotypes.\n\nThis is a first report in the history of rice genetics and pre-breeding research, that black rice has been created through wide crossing and introgression by combining wild rice O. rufipogon in the genetic background of O. sativa. Present experimental evidence provides a new model of black rice origin. Thus, black rice (indica type) of Indian subcontinent originated independently through natural out crossing and artificial selection in the course of domestication.",

    "abstract": "Lethal gang attacks, in which multiple aggressors attack a single victim, are among the most widespread forms of violence between human groups. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), as well as wolves (Canis lupus), spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta), and lions (Panthera leo), perform gang attacks during raids. In raids, a few individuals of a group enter another groups territory and attack its members if found in numerical disadvantage. Current theory predicts that raids and gang attacks are linked to fission-fusion dynamics, i.e., the capacity of a group to split into smaller subgroups of variable size and composition. However, over the last decade, research on social mammals without fission-fusion societies nor raiding have shown that they may also be involved in intergroup lethal gang attacks. Thus, neither fission-fusion dynamics nor raiding are required for gang attacks to evolve. Based on our first-ever reports of intergroup gang attacks in the crested macaque (Macaca nigra), combined with the synthesis of earlier observations of such attacks in several species living in stable groups, we develop a new hypothesis about the proximate causes leading to lethal intergroup aggression. We propose that the ability to estimate numerical odds, form coalitionary bonds, and show hostility towards outgroup individuals may suffice to trigger intergroup gang attacks when the conditions favour an imbalance of power between victims and attackers.",

When very good templates are not available, it is challenging to identify the best templates, build accurate sequence-template alignments and construct 3D models from alignments.\n\nResultsThis paper presents a new method NDThreader (New Deep-learning Threader) to address the challenges of TBM. DNThreader first employs DRNF (deep convolutional residual neural fields), which is an integration of deep ResNet (convolutional residue neural networks) and CRF (conditional random fields), to align a query protein to templates without using any distance information. Then NDThreader uses ADMM (alternating direction method of multipliers) and DRNF to further improve sequence-template alignments by making use of predicted distance potential. Finally NDThreader builds 3D models from a sequence-template alignment by feeding it and sequence co-evolution information into a deep ResNet to predict inter-atom distance distribution, which is then fed into PyRosetta for 3D model construction. Our experimental results on the CASP13 and CAMEO data show that our methods outperform existing ones such as CNFpred, HHpred, DeepThreader and CEthreader. NDThreader was blindly tested in CASP14 as a part of RaptorX server, which obtained the best GDT score among all CASP14 servers on the 58 TBM targets.\n\nAvailability and Implementationavailable as a part of web server at http://raptorx.uchicago.edu\n\nContactjinboxu@gmail.com\n\nSupplementary InformationSupplementary data are available online.",

    "abstract": "Obesity associated type 2 diabetes mellitus is one of the most common metabolic disorder worldwide. The prognosis of obesity associated type 2 diabetes mellitus patients has remained poor, though considerable efforts have been made to improve the treatment of this metabolic disorder. Therefore, identifying significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated in metabolic disorder advancement and exploiting them as new biomarkers or potential therapeutic targets for metabolic disorder is highly valuable. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened out from gene expression omnibus (GEO) dataset (GSE132831) and subjected to GO and REACTOME pathway enrichment analyses. The protein - protein interactions network, module analysis, target gene - miRNA regulatory network and target gene - TF regulatory network were constructed, and the top ten hub genes were selected. The relative expression of hub genes was detected in RT-PCR. Furthermore, diagnostic value of hub genes in obesity associated type 2 diabetes mellitus patients was investigated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Small molecules were predicted for obesity associated type 2 diabetes mellitus by using molecular docking studies. A total of 872 DEGs, including 439 up regulated genes and 432 down regulated genes were observed. Second, functional enrichment analysis showed that these DEGs are mainly involved in the axon guidance, neutrophil degranulation, plasma membrane bounded cell projection organization and cell activation. The top ten hub genes (MYH9, FLNA, DCTN1, CLTC, ERBB2, TCF4, VIM, LRRK2, IFI16 and CAV1) could be utilized as potential diagnostic indicators for obesity associated type 2 diabetes mellitus. The hub genes were validated in obesity associated type 2 diabetes mellitus. This investigation found effective and reliable molecular biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis by integrated bioinformatics analysis, suggesting new and key therapeutic targets for obesity associated type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

Using stochastic network-free kinetic models, we establish a physical-chemical basis for the concentration threshold of heterotypic multivalent molecules required for LLPS. We associate phase separation with a bimodal partitioning of the cluster distribution into small oligomers vs. huge polymers. The simulations reveal that LLPS obeys the solubility product constant (Ksp): the product of monomer concentrations, accounting for ideal stoichiometries, does not exceed a threshold no matter how much additional monomer is added to the system - additional monomer is funneled into large clusters. The Ksp applies over a range of valencies and stoichiometries. However, consistent with the importance of disordered domains for LLPS, removing flexible linker domains funnels valency-matched monomers into a \"dimer trap\", and Ksp no longer defines a threshold for large cluster formation. We propose Ksp as a new tool for elucidating biomolecular condensate biophysics.",

    "abstract": "Antigen (Ag) crosslinking of immunoglobulin E-receptor (IgE-Fc{varepsilon}RI) complexes in mast cells stimulates transmembrane (TM) signaling, requiring phosphorylation of the clustered Fc{varepsilon}RI by lipid-anchored Lyn tyrosine kinase. Previous studies showed that this stimulated coupling between Lyn and Fc{varepsilon}RI occurs in liquid ordered (Lo)-like nanodomains of the plasma membrane and that Lyn binds directly to cytosolic segments of Fc{varepsilon}RI that it initially phosphorylates for amplified activity. Net phosphorylation above a non-functional threshold is achieved in the stimulated state, but not in the resting state, and current evidence supports the hypothesis that this relies on disruption by Ag-crosslinking of a balance between Lyn and tyrosine phosphatase activities. However, the structural interactions that underlie the stimulation process remain poorly defined. This study evaluates the relative contributions and functional importance of different types of interactions leading to supra-threshold phosphorylation of Ag-crosslinked IgE-Fc{varepsilon}RI in live rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) mast cells. Our high-precision diffusion measurements by Imaging Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (ImFCS) on multiple structural variants of Lyn and other lipid-anchored probes confirm subtle, stimulated stabilization of the Lo-like nanodomains and concomitant sharpening of segregation from liquid-disordered (Ld)-like regions. With other structural variants we determine that lipid-based interactions are essential for access by Lyn leading to phosphorylation of and protein-based binding to clustered Fc{varepsilon}RI. By contrast, TM tyrosine phosphatase, PTP, is excluded from these regions by steric repulsion of TM segments and preference for Ld-like regions. Overall, we establish a synergy of lipid-based, protein-based, and steric interactions underlying functional TM signaling in mast cells.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTLipid organization of the plasma membrane is known to be important for facilitating protein interactions in transmembrane signaling. However, the orchestration of these interactions in live cells has been elusive. We employed ImFCS to systemically investigate the interplay of lipids and proteins during signaling in mast cells, initiated as phosphorylation of Ag-crosslinked IgE-Fc{varepsilon}RI by lipid-anchored Lyn kinase. We find lipid-based interactions are first required for protein-based phosphorylation of the clustered Fc{varepsilon}RI within Lo-like nanodomains. Transmembrane phosphatases must be excluded from these regions, and we find this is mediated by their preference for Ld-like regions and by steric exclusion from the clustered Fc{varepsilon}RI proteins. ImFCS provides quantitative characterization of the functional link between features of plasma membrane organization and transmembrane signaling.",

    "abstract": "Thermodynamic preferences to form non-native conformations are crucial for understanding how nucleic acids fold and function. However, they are difficult to measure experimentally because this requires accurately determining the population of minor low-abundance (<10%) conformations in a sea of other conformations. Here we show that melting experiments enable facile measurements of thermodynamic preferences to adopt non-native conformations in DNA and RNA. The key to this  delta-melt approach is to use chemical modifications to render specific minor non-native conformations the major state. The validity and robustness of delta-melt is established for four different non-native conformations under various physiological conditions and sequence contexts through independent measurements of thermodynamic preferences using NMR. delta-melt is fast, simple, cost-effective, and enables thermodynamic preferences to be measured for exceptionally low-populated conformations. Using delta-melt, we obtained rare insights into conformational cooperativity, obtaining evidence for significant cooperativity (1.0-2.5 kcal/mol) when simultaneously forming two adjacent Hoogsteen base pairs. We also measured the thermodynamic preferences to form G-C+ and A-T Hoogsteen and A-T base open states for nearly all sixteen trinucleotide sequence contexts and found distinct sequence-specific variations on the order of 2-3 kcal/mol. This rich landscape of sequence-specific non-native minor conformations in the DNA double helix may help shape the sequence-specificity of DNA biochemistry. Thus, melting experiments can now be used to access thermodynamic information regarding regions of the free energy landscape of biomolecules beyond the native folded and unfolded conformations.\n\nSignificance StatementThermodynamic preferences of nucleic acids to adopt non-native conformations are crucial for understanding how they function but prove difficult to measure experimentally. As a result, little is known about how these thermodynamic preferences vary with sequence and structural contexts, physiological conditions, and chemical modifications. Here, we show that modifications stabilizing non-native conformations and rendering them the major state, in conjunction with melting experiments, enable facile measurements of thermodynamic preferences to form various non-native conformations in DNA and RNA. delta-melt provided rare insights into the cooperativity of forming tandem Hoogsteen base pairs and revealed large and distinct sequence-specific preferences to form G-C+ and A-T Hoogsteen and A-T base open conformations in DNA, which may contribute to sequence-specific DNA biochemistry.",

Axonal and synaptic structures and the tonotopic differentiation of ion channels in the MSO underwent profound refinements after hearing onset in the uterus.
