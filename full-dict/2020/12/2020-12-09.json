    "abstract": "Bioluminescence of Mediterranean sea pens has been known for a long time, but basic parameters such as the emission spectra are unknown. Here we examined bioluminescence in three species of Pennatulacea, Pennatula rubra, Pteroeides griseum, and Veretillum cynomorium. Following dark adaptation, all three species could easily be stimulated to produce green light. All species were also fluorescent, with bioluminescence being produced at the same sites as the fluorescence. The shape of the fluorescence spectra indicates the presence of a GFP closely associated with light production, as seen in Renilla. Our videos show that light proceeds as waves along the colony from the point of stimulation for all three species, as observed in many other octocorals. Features of their bioluminescence are strongly suggestive of a \"burglar alarm\" function.",

    "abstract": "Seed and seedling are the most critical stages of cacti life cycle. From the thousands of seeds produced in a reproductive season, only a small fraction gets to germinate, the rest gets lost due to predation or gets potentially buried in the seed bank. These early stages depend on facilitation by nurse plants for germination and seedling recruitment. In this paper, we aim to describe some aspects of the recruitment of Cephalocereus polylophus. We tested the viability of seeds with different storage times as an indicator of their potential to form a short-term seed bank. Through the analysis of seed germination and seedlings survival under the canopy of two nurse plant species and open areas, we aimed to assess the importance of facilitation for recruitment. A predator exclusion experiment was used to evaluate the intensity of herbivory on seeds and seedlings of different developmental stages. Seeds had germination rates above 90%, even after two years of storage. Seed germination was only registered under one of the two nurses. After two years, up to 19% of the seedlings planted under both nurse plants survived. Protection against herbivores increased survival chances from 30 to 52 % for all age-group seedlings. Considering that facilitation is a crucial interaction for C. polylophus, future conservation programs should include the protection of plant communities.",

The evolution of cooperation is facilitated by its horizontal transmission and by an association between social interactions and horizontal transmission. The effect of oblique transmission depends on the horizontal transmission bias. Stable polymorphism of cooperation and defection can occur, and when it does, reduced association between social interactions and horizontal transmission evolves, which leads to a decreased frequency of cooperation and lower population mean fitness. The deterministic conditions are compared to outcomes of stochastic simulations of structured populations.

However, a study holistically linking aging and circadian gene expression is missing. Using the colonial chordate Botryllus schlosseri, we combined transcriptome sequencing and stem cell-mediated aging phenomena to test how circadian gene expression changes with age. This revealed that B. schlosseri clock and clock-controlled genes oscillate organism-wide, with daily, age-specific amplitudes and frequencies. These age-related, circadian patterns persist at the tissue level, where dramatic variations in cyclic gene expression of tissue profiles link to morphological and cellular aging phenotypes. Similar cyclical expression differences were found in hundreds of pathways associated with known hallmarks of aging, as well as pathways that were not previously linked to aging. The atlas we developed points to alterations in circadian gene expression as a key regulator of aging.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryThe Ticking Clock: Systemic changes in circadian gene expression correlates with wide-ranging phenotypes of aging",

    "abstract": "The drivers of periodic population cycling by some animal species in northern systems remain unresolved1. Mysterious disappearances of populations of the Neotropical, herdforming white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari, henceforth \"WLP\") have been anecdotally documented and explained as local events resulting from migratory movements or overhunting2,3,4, or as disease outbreaks5,6, and have not been considered in the context of large-scale species-specific population dynamics. Here we present evidence that WLP disappearances represent troughs in population cycles that occur with regular periodicity and are synchronized at regional and perhaps continent-wide spatial scales. Analysis of 43 disappearance events and 88 years of commercial and subsistence harvesting data reveals boom - bust population cycles lasting from 20 to 30 years, in which a rapid population crash occurring over 1 to 5 years is followed by a period of absence of 7 to12 years and then a slow growth phase. Overhunting alone cannot explain the crashes, but as in northern systems dispersal during the growth phase appears to play a key role. This is the first documentation of population cycling in a tropical vertebrate.",

Here, we evaluated the effect of river pollution of industrial and urban sites on the microbial community composition and distribution in the Nakivubo wetland and its catchment areas in Lake Victoria basin, Uganda. Samples were collected from two industrial and one urban polluted sites and the microbial diversity was analyzed based on a 16S rRNA gene clone library. Differences in microbial diversity and community structure were observed at different sampling points. Bacteria associated with bioremediation were found in sites receiving industrial waste, while a low proportion of important human-pathogenic bacteria were seen in urban polluted sites. While Escherichia spp. was the most dominant genus of bacteria for all sites, three unique bacteria, Bacillus sp., Pseudomonas sp., Thermomonas sp., which have been reported to transform contaminants such as heavy metals and hydrocarbons (such as oils) by their metabolic pathways were also identified. Our results may serve as a basis for further studies assessing microbial community structure changes among polluted sites at Nakivubo Water Channel for management and monitoring.

    "abstract": "Interactions between plants and their animal pollinators can shape processes of divergence and gene flow within associated lineages. For example, in the obligate mutualism between figs (Ficus) and fig pollinator wasps (family Agaonidae), each wasp species typically pollinates a single fig species, potentially reinforcing reproductive isolation among different wasp species. Multiple pollinator species, however, can sometimes reproduce in the same host fig species, potentially enabling hybridization and introgression between wasp species. In a community of Panamanian strangler figs (section Americana), we use genome-wide ultraconserved element (UCE) loci to estimate phylogenetic relationships and test for hybridization and gene flow among 19 pollinator species associated with 16 host fig species. Previous studies showing ongoing pollinator sharing and a history of pollinator host switching are consistent with documented genetic admixture in their host figs. Here we investigate if host sharing and a dynamic evolutionary history including host switching has also resulted in hybridization and gene flow between pollinator species. Phylogenetic analyses recover strong support for well-delimited wasp species coupled with high interspecific divergence. There is no evidence for ongoing hybridization or introgression, even among pairs of pollinator species currently reproducing within the same host. In contrast to work suggesting admixture among Panamanian host figs, we conclude hybridization and interspecific gene flow have not been important processes shaping the evolutionary history of their pollinating wasps.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWith the ability to simultaneously sequence more than 5,000 disease-associated genes, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has replaced Sanger sequencing as the preferred method in the diagnostic field at the laboratory level. However, Sanger sequencing has been used routinely to confirm identified variants prior to reporting results. This validation process causes a turnaround time delay and cost increase. Thus, this study aimed to set a quality threshold that does not require Sanger confirmation by analyzing the characteristics of identified variants from whole exome sequencing (WES).\n\nMethodsOur study analyzed data on a total of 694 disease-causing variants from 578 WES samples that had been diagnosed with suspected genetic disease. These samples were sequenced by Novaseq6000 and Exome Research Panel v2. All 694 variants (513 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 181 indels) were validated by Sanger sequencing.\n\nResultsA total of 693 variants included 512 SNVs and 181 indels from 578 patients and 367 genes. Five hundred seven heterozygous SNVs with at > 250 quality score and > 0.3 allele fraction were 100% confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Five heterozygous variants and one homozygous variant were not confirmed by Sanger sequencing, which showed 98.8% accuracy. There were 146 heterozygous variants and 35 homozygous variants among 181 indels, of which 11 heterozygous variants were not confirmed by Sanger sequencing (93.9% accuracy). Five non-confirmed variants with high quality were not identified on the ram .bam file.\n\nConclusionOur results indicate that Sanger confirmation is not necessary for exome-derived SNVs with > 250 quality score and 0.3 > allele fraction set to an appropriate quality threshold. Indels or SNVs that do not meet the quality threshold should be reviewed by raw .bam file and Sanger confirmation should be performed to ensure accurate reporting.",

    "abstract": "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that couples the binding of extracellular ligands, such as EGF and transforming growth factor- (TGF-), to the initiation of intracellular signaling pathways. EGFR binds to EGF and TGF- with similar affinity but generates different signals from these ligands. To address the mechanistic basis of this phenomenon, we have carried out cryo-EM analyses of human EGFR bound to EGF and TGF-. We show that the extracellular module adopts an ensemble of dimeric conformations when bound to either EGF or TGF-. The two extreme states of this ensemble represent distinct ligand-bound quaternary structures in which the membrane-proximal tips of the extracellular module are either juxtaposed or separated. EGF and TGF- differ in their ability to maintain the conformation with the membrane-proximal tips of the extracellular module separated, and this conformation is stabilized preferentially by an oncogenic EGFR mutation. Close proximity of the transmembrane helices at the junction with the extracellular module has been associated previously with increased EGFR activity. Our results show how EGFR can couple the binding of different ligands to differential modulation of this proximity, thereby suggesting a molecular mechanism for the generation of ligand-sensitive differential outputs in this receptor family.",

    "abstract": "Liquid droplets formed by liquid-liquid phase separation are attracting attention as functional states of proteins in living cells. Liquid droplets are thought to activate enzymatic reactions by assembling the required molecules. Thus, liquid droplets usually increase the affinity of an enzyme to its substrates, leading to decreased KM values. In this study, we demonstrate a new mechanism of enzyme activation in the droplets using Llactate oxidase (LOX). In the presence of poly-L-lysine (PLL), LOX formed droplets with diameters of hundreds of nanometers to tens of micrometers, stabilized by electro-static interaction. The enzyme activity of LOX in the droplets was significantly enhanced by a fourfold decrease in KM and a tenfold increase in kcat. To our knowledge, this represents the first report for increasing kcat by the formation of the liquid droplet. Interestingly, the conformation of LOX changed in the liquid droplet, probably leading to increased kcat value. Understanding enzyme activation in the droplets provides essential information about enzyme function in living cells in addition to biotechnology applications.",

To prove this, we bioinformatically analyze ribosome profiling and miRNA binding sites and biochemically confirm that miRNA deficiency causes severe misfolding, which is rescued by slowing translating ribosomes. We demonstrate that non-cleaving shRNAs, targeting regions where elongation rates become faster in miRNA-deficient cells, improve protein folding with minimal effects on protein abundance.

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteriochromes (CBCRs) are bilin-binding photosensors of the phytochrome superfamily that show remarkable spectral diversity. The green/red CBCR subfamily is important for regulating chromatic acclimation of photosynthetic antenna in cyanobacteria and is applied for optogenetic control of gene expression in synthetic biology. They are suggested to combine the bilin C15-Z/C15-E photoisomerization with a change in the bilin protonation state to drive their absorption changes. However, structural information and direct evidence of the bilin protonation state are lacking. Here we report a high-resolution (1.63[A]) crystal structure of the bilin-binding domain of the chromatic acclimation sensor RcaE in the red-absorbing photoproduct state. The bilin is buried within a \"pan\" consisting of hydrophobic residues, where the bilin configuration/conformation is C5-Z,syn/C10-Z,syn/C15-E,syn with the A-C rings co-planar and the D-ring tilted. Three pyrrole nitrogens of the A-C rings are covered in the -face with a hydrophobic lid of Leu249 influencing the bilin pKa, whereas they are directly hydrogen-bonded in the {beta}-face with the carboxyl group of Glu217. Glu217 is further connected to a cluster of waters forming a hole in the pan, which are in exchange with solvent waters in molecular dynamics simulation. We propose that the \"holey pan\" structure functions as a proton-exit/influx pathway upon photoconversion. NMR analysis demonstrated that the four pyrrole nitrogen atoms are indeed fully protonated in the red-absorbing state, but one of them, most likely the B-ring nitrogen, is deprotonated in the green-absorbing state. These findings deepen our understanding of the diverse spectral tuning mechanisms present in CBCRs.\n\nSignificance StatementGreen/red CBCRs are one of the most important CBCR subfamilies owing to their physiological roles in cyanobacteria phylum and optogenetic applications. They are known to utilize a change in the bilin protonation state to drive the marked change in green/red absorption, but the structural basis of the protochromic green/red photocycle are not well understood. Here, we have determined the crystal structure of the chromatic acclimation sensor RcaE of this subfamily in the photoproduct state, demonstrating a unique conformation of the bilin and its interacting residues. In addition, we provide direct evidence of the protonation state of the bilin via NMR analysis. These findings bring insight to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the spectral diversity of CBCRs.",

    "abstract": "Previous work has shown that multi-offset detection in adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) can be used to image retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in monkeys and humans. However, though images of RGCs in anesthetized monkeys with high light levels produced high contrast images of RGCs, images from humans failed to reach the same contrast due to several drawbacks in the previous dual-wavelength multi-offset approach. Our aim here was to design and build a multi-offset detection pattern for humans at safe light levels that could reveal the retinal ganglion cell layer neurons with a contrast, robustness and acquisition time approaching results only previously obtained in monkeys. Here, we present a new imaging system using only one light source, compared to the previous dual-wavelength used on monkeys. Our single-wavelength solution allows for increased light power and eliminates problematic chromatic aberrations. Then, we demonstrate that a radial multi-offset detection pattern with an offset distance of 8-10 Airy Disk Diameter (ADD) is optimal to detect photons multiply scattered in all directions from RGCs thereby enhancing their contrast. This new setup and image processing pipeline led to improved imaging of retinal ganglion cells using multi-offset imaging in AOSLO.",

    "abstract": "Determination of molecular features that mediate clinically aggressive phenotypes in prostate cancer (PrCa) remains a major biological and clinical challenge. Here, we developed a biologically informed deep learning model (P-NET) to stratify PrCa patients by treatment resistance state and evaluate molecular drivers of treatment resistance for therapeutic targeting through complete model interpretability. Using a molecular cohort of 1,238 prostate cancers, we demonstrated that P-NET can predict cancer state using molecular data that is superior to other modeling approaches. Moreover, the biological interpretability within P-NET revealed established and novel molecularly altered candidates, such as MDM4 and FGFR1, that were implicated in predicting advanced disease and validated in vitro. Broadly, biologically informed fully interpretable neural networks enable preclinical discovery and clinical prediction in prostate cancer and may have general applicability across cancer types.",

    "abstract": "1Unsupervised clustering to identify distinct cell types is a crucial step in the analysis of scRNA-seq data. Current clustering methods are dependent on a number of parameters whose effect on the resulting solutions accuracy and reproducibility are poorly understood. The adjustment of clustering parameters is therefore ad-hoc, with most users deviating minimally from default settings. constclust is a novel meta-clustering method based on the idea that if the data contains distinct populations which a clustering method can identify, meaningful clusters should be robust to small changes in the parameters used to derive them. By reconciling solutions from a clustering method over multiple parameters, we can identify locally robust clusters of cells and their corresponding regions of parameter space. Rather than assigning cells to a single partition of the data set, this approach allows for discovery of discrete groups of cells which can correspond to the multiple levels of cellular identity. Additionally constclust requires significantly fewer computational resources than current consensus clustering methods for scRNA-seq data. We demonstrate the utility, accuracy, and performance of constclust as part of the analysis workflow. constclust is available at https://github.com/ivirshup/constclust1.",

    "abstract": "Predicted increases in forest drought mortality highlight the need for predictors of incipient drought-induced mortality (DIM) risk that enable proactive large-scale management. Such predictors should be consistent across plants with varying morphology and physiology. Because of their integrative nature, indicators of water status are promising candidates for real time monitoring of DIM, particularly if they standardize morphological differences among plants. We assessed the extent to which differences in morphology and physiology between Pinus ponderosa populations influence time to mortality and the predictive power of key indicators of DIM risk. Time to incipient mortality differed between populations but occurred at the same relative water content (RWC) and water potential (WP). RWC and WP were accurate predictors of drought mortality risk. These results highlight that variables related to water status capture critical thresholds during DIM and the associated dehydration processes. Both WP and RWC are promising candidates for large-scale assessments of DIM risk. RWC is of special interest because it allows comparisons across different morphologies and can be remotely sensed. Our results offer promise for real-time landscape-level monitoring of DIM and its global impacts in the near term.",

Even interpretation of dose-response based on single-cell data is not straightforward: signaling responses can differ significantly between cells, encompass multiple signaling effectors, and have dynamic character. Here, we use probabilistic modeling and information-theory to introduce fractional response analysis (FRA), which quantifies changes in fractions of cells with given response levels. FRA can be universally performed for heterogeneous, multivariate, and dynamic measurements and, as we demonstrate, uncovers otherwise hidden patterns in single-cell data. In particular, we show that fractional responses to type I interferon in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells are very similar across different cell types, despite significant differences in mean or median responses and degrees of cell-to-cell heterogeneity. Further, we demonstrate that fractional responses to cytokines scale linearly with the log of the cytokine dose, which uncovers that cellular populations are sensitive to fold-changes in the dose, as opposed to additive changes.",

    "abstract": "A variety of strategies are used to combine multi-echo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, yet recent literature lacks a systematic comparison of the available options. Here we compare six different approaches derived from multi-echo data and evaluate their influences on BOLD sensitivity for offline and in particular real-time use cases: a single-echo time series (based on Echo 2), the real-time T2*-mapped time series (T2*FIT) and four combined time series (T2*-weighted, tSNR-weighted, TE-weighted, and a new combination scheme termed T2*FIT-weighted). We compare the influences of these six multi-echo derived time series on BOLD sensitivity using a healthy participant dataset (N=28) with four task-based fMRI runs and two resting state runs. We show that the T2*FIT-weighted combination yields the largest increase in temporal signal-to-noise ratio across task and resting state runs. We demonstrate additionally for all tasks that the T2*FIT time series consistently yields the largest offline effect size measures and real-time region-of-interest based functional contrasts. These improvements show the possible utility of multi-echo fMRI for studies employing real-time paradigms, while caution is still advised due to decreased tSNR of the T2*FIT time series. We recommend the use and continued exploration of T2*FIT for offline task-based and real-time fMRI analysis.

The relation between indoxyl sulfate and psychic anxiety was mediated only through the metabolites effect on the SCC-FC with the premotor area. Baseline indole abundances were unrelated to post-treatment outcome measures, which suggests that CBT and antidepressant medications relieve anxiety via mechanisms unrelated to gut microbiota.\n\nConclusionsA peripheral gut microbiome-derived metabolite was associated with altered neural processing and with psychiatric symptom (anxiety) in humans, which provides further evidence that gut microbiome disruption can contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders that may require different therapeutic approaches.",

    "abstract": "In higher plants, the development of the vascular system is controlled by a complex network of transcription factors. However, how nutrient availability in the vascular cells affects their development remains to be addressed. At the cellular level, cytosolic sugar availability is regulated mainly by sugar exchanges at the tonoplast through active and/or facilitated transport. In Arabidopsis thaliana, among the tonoplastic transporters, SWEET16 and SWEET17 genes have been previously localized in the vascular system. Here, using a reverse genetic approach, we propose that sugar exchanges at the tonoplast, regulated by SWEET16, are important for xylem cell division as revealed in particular by the decreased number of xylem cells in the swt16 mutant and the expression of SWEET16 at the procambium-xylem boundary. In addition, we demonstrate that transport of hexoses mediated by SWEET16 and/or SWEET17 is required to sustain the formation of the xylem secondary cell wall. This result is in line with a defect in the xylem cell wall composition as measured by FTIR in the swt16swt17 double mutant and by upregulation of several genes involved in secondary cell wall synthesis. Our work therefore supports a model in which xylem development is partially dependent on the exchange of hexoses at the tonoplast of xylem-forming cells.",

    "abstract": "Directed evolution is a powerful method to optimize proteins and metabolic reactions towards user-defined goals. It usually involves subjecting genes or pathways to iterative rounds of mutagenesis, selection, and amplification. While powerful, systematic searches through large sequence-spaces is a labor-intensive task, and can be further limited by a priori knowledge about the optimal initial search space, and/or limits in terms of screening throughput. Here we demonstrate an integrated directed evolution workflow for metabolic pathway enzymes that continuously generates enzyme variants using the recently developed orthogonal replication system, OrthoRep, and screens for optimal performance in high-throughput using a transcription factor-based biosensor. We demonstrate the strengths of this workflow by evolving a ratelimiting enzymatic reaction of the biosynthetic pathway for cis,cis-muconic acid (CCM), a precursor used for bioplastic and coatings, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. After two weeks of simply iterating between passaging of cells to generate variant enzymes via OrthoRep and high-throughput sorting of best-performing variants using a transcription factor-based biosensor for CCM, we ultimately identified variant enzymes improving CCM titers >13-fold compared to reference enzymes. Taken together, the combination of synthetic biology tools as adopted in this study, is an efficient approach to debottleneck repetitive workflows associated with directed evolution of metabolic enzymes.",

    "abstract": "Anti-seizure drug (ASD) targets are widely expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. It remains unknown if the action of an ASD upon inhibitory neurons could counteract its beneficial effects on excitatory neurons (or vice versa), thereby reducing the efficacy of the ASD. Here, we examine whether the efficacy of the ASD retigabine (RTG) is altered after removal of the Kv7 potassium channel subunit KCNQ2, one of its drug targets, from parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV-INs). Parvalbumin-Cre (PV-Cre) mice were crossed with Kcnq2-floxed (Kcnq2fl/fl) mice to conditionally delete Kcnq2 from PV-INs. In these conditional knockout mice (cKO, PV-Kcnq2fl/fl), RTG (10 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly delayed the onset of either picrotoxin (PTX, 10 mg/kg, i.p)- or kainic acid (KA, 30mg/kg, i.p.)-induced convulsive seizures compared to vehicle, while RTG was not effective in wild-type littermates (WT). Immunostaining for KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 revealed that both subunits were enriched at axon initial segments (AISs) of hippocampal CA1 PV-INs, and their specific expression was selectively abolished in cKO mice. Accordingly, the M-currents recorded from CA1 PV-INs and their sensitivity to RTG were significantly reduced in cKO mice. While the ability of RTG to suppress CA1 excitatory neurons in hippocampal slices was unchanged in cKO mice, its suppressive effect on the spike activity of CA1 PV-INs was significantly reduced compared with WT mice. In addition, the RTG-induced suppression on intrinsic membrane excitability of PV-INs in WT mice was significantly reduced in cKO mice. These findings suggest that preventing RTG from suppressing PV-INs improves its anticonvulsant effect.\n\nSignificance StatementOne out of three patients with epilepsy remain resistant to anti-seizure drugs (ASD). Therefore, strategies that can enhance the efficacy of current ASDs or aid in the development of novel ASDs are in high demand. Here we show that by sparing a subset of inhibitory neurons, the ASD retigabine becomes more efficacious. These findings indicate that developing the ASDs that have relatively greater effects on excitatory over inhibitory neurons may be an effective strategy to improve the efficacy of ASDs.",

Genetic and adeno-associated virus-mediated deletion of Per2 in glial cells of mice leads to a depression-resistant phenotype, as manifested in reduced despair and anxiety. This is paralleled by an increase of the GABA transporter 3 (Gat3) mRNA and a reduction of glutamate levels in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Exclusive deletion of Per2 in glia of the NAc reduced despair, but had no influence on anxiety. Our data provide strong evidence for an important role of glial Per2 in regulating mood-related behavior.",

We examined acute optogenetic stimulation of dopamine cells in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) as mice engaged in an effort-based decision-making task. Tyrosine hydroxylase-Cre mice were injected with Cre-dependent ChR2 or eYFP control in VTA. While eYFP control mice showed effortful discounting, stimulation of dopamine cells in ChR2 mice disrupted effort-based decision-making by reducing choice towards the lever associated with a preferred outcome and greater effort. Surprisingly, disruptions in effortful discounting were observed in subsequent test sessions conducted in the absence of optogenetic stimulation, however during these sessions ChR2 mice displayed enhanced high choice responding across trial blocks. These findings suggest increases in VTA dopamine cell activity can disrupt effort-based decision-making in distinct ways dependent on the timing of optogenetic stimulation.",

Here we demonstrate a striking departure from this conventional mapping in the secondary visual area (V2) of the tree shrew. Although local retinotopy is preserved, orthogonal axes of the retina are represented along the same axis of the cortical surface, an unexpected geometry explained by an orderly sinusoidal transform of the retinal surface. This sinusoidal topography is ideally suited for achieving uniform coverage in an elongated area like V2, is predicted by mathematical models designed to achieve wiring minimization, and provides a novel explanation for stripe-like patterns of intra-cortical connections and stimulus response properties in V2. Our findings suggest that cortical circuits flexibly implement solutions to sensory surface representation, with dramatic consequences for the large-scale layout of topographic maps.",

    "abstract": "As the oldest extant metazoans, sponges (Phylum Porifera) have been forming symbiotic relationships with microbes that may date back as far as 700 million years. Most symbionts are conserved within a narrow host range and perform specialized functions. However, there are widely distributed bacterial taxa such as Poribacteria, SAUL and Tethybacterales that are found in a broad range of invertebrate hosts. Here, we added eleven new genomes to the Tethybacterales order, identified a novel family, and show that functional potential differs between the three Tethybacterales families. We compare the Tethybacterales with the well-characterized Entoporibacteria and show that these broad-host range, sponge-associated bacteria likely perform distinct functions within their hosts and that their respective phylogenies are incongruent with their host phylogenies. These results suggests that ancestors of these bacteria may have undergone multiple association events, rather than a single association event followed by co-evolution.\n\nIMPORTANCEMarine sponges often form symbiotic relationships with bacteria that fulfil a specific need within the sponge holobiont, and these symbionts are often conserved within a narrow range of related taxa. To date, there exist only three know bacterial taxa (Entoporibacteria, SAUL and Tethybacterales) that are globally distributed and found in a broad range of sponge hosts, and little is known about the latter two. Understanding what distinguishes these broad-host range symbionts from specialized symbionts will provide insight into the mechanisms by which sponges form these symbioses. We show that the functional potential of broad-host range symbionts is conserved at a family level and that these symbionts have been acquired several times over evolutionary history. This contrasts with specialized symbionts, where function is often a strain-specific trait and have co-evolved with their host following a single association event.",

    "abstract": "Type III Secretion Systems (T3SS) deliver subunits from the bacterial cytosol to nascent cell surface flagella. Early flagellar subunits that form the rod and hook substructures are unchaperoned and contain their own export signals. A gate recognition motif (GRM) docks them at the FlhBc component of the FlhAB-FliPQR export gate, but the gate must then be opened and subunits must be unfolded to pass through the flagellar channel. This induced us to seek further signals on the subunits. Here, we identify a second signal at the extreme N-terminus of flagellar rod and hook subunits and determine that key to the signal is its hydrophobicity. We show that the two export signal elements are recognised separately and sequentially, as the N-terminal signal is recognised by the flagellar export machinery only after subunits have docked at FlhBC via the GRM. The position of the N-terminal hydrophobic signal in the subunit sequence relative to the GRM appeared to be important, as a FlgD deletion variant (FlgDshort), in which the distance between the N-terminal signal and the GRM was shortened,  stalled at the export machinery and was not exported. The attenuation of motility caused by FlgDshort was suppressed by mutations that destabilised the closed conformation of the FlhAB-FliPQR export gate, suggesting that the hydrophobic N-terminal signal might trigger opening of the flagellar export gate.",

    "abstract": "While aggregation-prone proteins are known to accelerate ageing and cause age-related diseases, the cellular mechanisms that drive their cytotoxicity remain unresolved. The orthologous proteins MOAG-4, SERF1A and SERF2 have recently been identified as cellular modifiers of such cytotoxicity. Using a peptide array screening approach on human amyloidogenic proteins, we found that SERF2 interacted with specific patterns of negatively charged and hydrophobic, aromatic amino acids. The absence of such patterns, or the neutralization of the positive charge in SERF2, prevented these interactions and abolished the amyloid-promoting activity of SERF2. In a protein aggregation model in the nematode C. elegans, protein aggregation was suppressed by mutating the endogenous locus of MOAG-4 to neutralize charge. Our data indicate that charge interactions are required for MOAG-4 and SERF2 to promote aggregation. Such charged interactions might accelerate the primary nucleation of amyloid by initiating structural changes and by decreasing colloidal stability. Our finding that negatively charged segments are overrepresented in amyloid-forming proteins suggests that inhibition of charge interactions deserves exploration as a strategy to target age-related protein toxicity.\n\nSignificance StatementHow aging causes relatively common diseases such as Alzheimers and Parkinsons is still a mystery. Since toxic structural changes in proteins are likely to be responsible, we investigated biological mechanisms that could drive such changes. We made use of a modifying factor called SERF2, which accelerates structural changes and aggregation of several disease-related proteins. Through a peptide-binding screen, we found that SERF2 acts on negatively charged protein regions. The abundance of such regions in the disease-related proteins explains why SERF has its effect. Removing positive charge in SERF was sufficient to suppress protein aggregation in models for disease. We propose that blocking charge-interactions with SERF or other modifiers could serve as a general approach to treat age-related protein toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Tripartite motif protein 28 (TRIM28), a universal mediator of Kruppel-associated box domain zinc fingers (KRAB-ZNFs), is known to regulate DNA methylation of many repetitive elements and several imprinted loci. TRIM28 serves as a scaffold unit that is essential for the formation of stable repressor complexes. In the present study we found that TRIM28 is a binding partner for methyl-DNA binding protein Kaiso. Kaiso is a transcription factor that belongs to the BTB/POZ -zinc finger family. Recent data suggest that deficiency of Kaiso led to reduction of DNA methylation within the imprinting control region of H19/IGF2. Thus, we hypothesized that Kaiso and TRIM28 may cooperate to control methylated genes. We demonstrated that Kaiso interacts with TRIM28 via its two domains: BTB/POZ and three zinc finger domains. When bound to Kaisos zinc finger domains TRIM28 weakens their interactions with methylated DNA in vitro. Specific association of TRIM28 with BTB/POZ domain causes Kaiso hyperSUMOylation. Altogether our data describe a putative role of TRIM28 as a regulator of Kaiso activity.",

    "abstract": "Protein lysine acetylation, regulates a wide range of cellular functions and is controlled by protein deacetylases called sirtuins. In eukaryotes, sirtuins activity is coupled to the spatiotemporally-controlled NAD+ level. However, regulation of the bacterial sirtuin CobB and its coupling to the NAD+ metabolism is not well understood. In this work we show that such coordination in Escherichia coli cells is achieved through a CobB interaction with PRPP synthase Prs, an enzyme necessary for NAD+ synthesis. Probing CobB protein-protein interactions, we demonstrate that it forms a stable complex with Prs. This assembly stimulates CobB deacetylase activity and partially protects it from inhibition by nicotinamide. We provide evidence that Prs acetylation is not necessary for CobB binding but affects the global acetylome and CobB activity in vivo. Consequently, we show that Prs acetylation status affects bacterial growth under different metabolic regimes. Therefore, we propose that CobB-Prs crosstalk orchestrates the NAD+ metabolism and protein acetylation in response to environmental cues.",

    "abstract": "Small RNA pathways defend the germlines of animals against selfish genetic elements and help to maintain genomic integrity. At the same time, their activity needs to be well-controlled to prevent silencing of  self genes. Here, we reveal a proteolytic mechanism that controls endogenous small interfering (22G) RNA activity in the Caenorhabditis elegans germline to protect genome integrity and maintain fertility. We find that WAGO-1 and WAGO-3 Argonaute (Ago) proteins are matured through proteolytic processing of their unusually proline-rich N-termini. In the absence of DPF-3, a P-granule-localized N-terminal dipeptidase orthologous to mammalian DPP8/9, processing fails, causing a change of identity of 22G RNAs bound to these WAGO proteins. Desilencing of repeat- and transposon-derived transcripts, DNA damage and acute sterility ensue. These phenotypes are recapitulated when WAGO-1 and WAGO-3 are rendered resistant to DFP-3-mediated processing, identifying them as critical substrates of DPF-3. We conclude that N-terminal processing of Ago proteins regulates their activity and promotes discrimination of self from non-self by ensuring association with the proper complement of small RNAs.\n\nGraphical Abstract: The role of DPF-3 in the fertility of the animals O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY\n\nIn wild type animals, the WAGO-1 and WAGO-3 Argonaute proteins are produced as immature pro-proteins with N-termini (N) that are unusually rich in prolines (P). N-terminal processing by DPF-3 is required for loading of the proper small RNA cargo and stabilization of WAGO-3. Accordingly, loss of this processing activity causes desilencing of transposable elements (TE), cell death and sterility.",

    "abstract": "Gain and loss of DNA methylation in cells is a dynamic process that tends to achieve an equilibrium. Many factors are involved in maintaining the balance between DNA methylation and demethylation. Previously, it was shown that methyl-DNA protein Kaiso may attract NcoR, SMRT repressive complexes affecting histone modifications. On the other hand, the deficiency of Kaiso resulted in slightly reduced methylation of ICR in H19/Igf2 locus and Oct4 promoter in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. However, nothing is known whether Kaiso may attract DNA methyltransferase to influence DNA methylation level. The main idea of this work is that Kaiso may lead to DNA hypermethylation attracting de novo DNA methyltransferases. We demonstrated that Kaiso regulates TRIM25 promoter methylation. It can form a complex with DNMT3b. BTB/POZ domain of Kaiso and ADD domain of DNA methyltransferase are essential for complex formation. Thus, Kaiso can affect DNA methylation.",

We detected two hemoglobin genes that are significantly upregulated by more than 7-fold in the offspring of hypoxia exposed males. Moreover, the offspring which maintained equilibrium the longest showed greatest upregulation in hemoglobin expression. We did not detect differential methylation at any of the differentially expressed genes, suggesting that another epigenetic mechanism is responsible for alterations in gene expression.

Furthermore, we show that there is a unified underlying theory underlying these convergences: all of them can be interpreted as instantiations of players in a potential game implementing a multiplicative weights updating algorithm to converge to equilibrium, making use of the Baum-Eagon Theorem. To analyse varying environments, we introduce the concept of  virtual convergence, under which, even if fixation is not attained, the population nevertheless achieves the fitness growth rate it would have had under convergence to an optimal genotype. Virtual convergence is attained by asexual, haploid sexual, and multi-locus diploid reproducing populations, even if environments vary arbitrarily.

    "abstract": "Of the 16 non-structural proteins (Nsps) encoded by SARS CoV-2, Nsp3 is the largest and plays important roles in the viral life cycle. Being a large, multidomain, transmembrane protein, Nsp3 has been the most challenging Nsp to characterize. Encoded within Nsp3 is the papain-like protease PLpro domain that cleaves not only the viral protein but also polyubiquitin and the ubiquitin-like modifier ISG15 from host cells. We here compare the interactors of PLpro and Nsp3 and find a largely overlapping interactome. Intriguingly, we find that near full length Nsp3 is a more active protease compared to the minimal catalytic domain of PLpro. Using a MALDI-TOF based assay, we screen 1971 approved clinical compounds and identify five compounds that inhibit PLpro with IC50s in the low micromolar range but showed cross reactivity with other human deubiquitinases and had no significant antiviral activity in cellular SARS-CoV-2 infection assays. We therefore looked for alternative methods to block PLpro activity and engineered competitive nanobodies that bind to PLpro at the substrate binding site with nanomolar affinity thus inhibiting the enzyme. Our work highlights the importance of studying Nsp3 and provides tools and valuable insights to investigate Nsp3 biology during the viral infection cycle.",

On a collection of 168,311 bacterial genomes, totalling 587 GB, we achieve the compression ratio around the factor of 730, and the compression (resp. decompression) speed around 1070 MB/s (resp. 740 MB/s) using 8 hardware threads, on a computer with a 6-core / 12-thread CPU and a fast SSD, being about 4 times more succinct and more than an order of magnitude faster in the compression than our main competitors.\n\nAvailability and implementationMBGC is freely available at github.com/kowallus/mbgc.",

We define a simple distance-based measurement termed a perimeter distance mean (PDmean) which quantifies the relative proximity of objects in one fluorescent channel to objects in a second fluorescent channel in 2D or 3D microscopy datasets. PDmean measurements were able to accurately identify known changes in colocalisation in computer-generated and real-world microscopy datasets. We argue that this approach provides substantial advantages over currently used distance-based colocalisation analysis methods.

    "abstract": "Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (ATRT) are incurable high-grade pediatric brain tumors. Concepts for molecular-driven therapies in ATRTs lag behind, mainly due to the absence of actionable genetic alterations. We performed genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens in six human ATRT cell lines and identified a total of 671 context-specific essential genes. Based on these genetic dependencies, we constructed a library of small-molecule inhibitors that we found to preferentially inhibit growth of ATRT cells. CDK4/6 inhibitors, among the most potent drugs in our library, are capable of inhibiting tumor growth due to mutual exclusive dependency of ATRTs on CDK4 or CDK6. These distinct dependencies drive heterogeneity in response to CDK4/6 inhibitors in ATRTs. Our approach might serve as a blueprint for fostering the identification of functionally-instructed therapeutic strategies in other incurable diseases beyond ATRT, whose genomic profiles also lack actionable alterations so far.",

    "abstract": "The C4 Urochloa spp (syn. Brachiaria) and Megathyrsus maximus (syn. Panicum maximum) are used as pasture for cattle across vast areas in tropical agriculture systems in Africa and South America. A key target for variety improvement is forage quality: enhanced digestibility could decrease amount of land required per unit production and enhanced lipid content could decrease methane emissions from cattle. For these traits, loss-of-function (LOF) alleles in known gene targets are predicted to improve them, making a reverse genetics approach of allele mining feasible. We studied allelic diversity of 20 target genes (11 for digestibility, 9 for lipid content) in 104 accessions selected to represent genetic diversity and ploidy levels of U. brizantha, U. decumbens, U. humidicola, U. ruziziensis and M. maximum. We used RNAseq and then bait-capture DNA-seq to improve gene models in a U. ruziziensis reference genome to assign polymorphisms with high confidence. We found 953 non-synonymous polymorphisms across all genes and accessions; within these, we identified 7 putative LOF alleles with high confidence, including ones in the non-redundant SDP1 and BAHD01 genes present in diploid and tetraploid accessions. These LOF alleles could respectively confer increased lipid content and digestibility if incorporated into a breeding programme.\n\nHighlightWe found gene variants in a collection of tropical grasses that could help reduce environmental impact of cattle production.",

    "abstract": "Background and AimsDomesticated maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) generally forms between two and six seminal roots, while its wild ancestor, Mexican annual teosinte (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis), typically lacks seminal roots. Maize also produces larger seeds than teosinte, and it generally has higher growth rates as a seedling. Maize was originally domesticated in the tropical soils of southern Mexico, but it was later brought to the Mexican highlands before spreading to other parts of the continent, where it experienced different soil resource constraints. The aims of this study were to understand the impact of increased seminal root number on seedling nitrogen acquisition and to model how differences in maize and teosinte phenotypes might have contributed to increased seminal root number in domesticated maize.\n\nMethodsSeedling root architectural models of a teosinte accession and a maize landrace were constructed by parameterizing the functional-structural plant model OpenSimRoot using plants grown in mesocosms. Seedling growth was simulated in a low-phosphorus environment, multiple low-nitrogen environments, and at variable planting densities. Models were also constructed to combine individual components of the maize and teosinte phenotypes.\n\nKey ResultsSeminal roots contributed about 35% of the nitrogen and phosphorus acquired by maize landrace seedlings in the first 25 days after planting. Increased seminal root number improved plant N acquisition under low-N environments with varying precipitation patterns, fertilization rates, soil textures, and planting densities. Models suggested that the optimal number of seminal roots for nutrient acquisition in teosinte is constrained by its limited seed carbohydrate reserves.\n\nConclusionsSeminal roots can improve the acquisition of both nitrogen and phosphorus in maize seedlings, and the increase in seed size associated with maize domestication may have facilitated increased seminal root number.",

    "abstract": "Acidification of the ocean due to high atmospheric CO2 levels may increase the resilience of diatoms causing dramatic shifts in abiotic and biotic cycles with lasting implications on marine ecosystems. Here, we report a potential bioindicator of a shift in the resilience of a coastal and centric model diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana under elevated CO2. Specifically, we have discovered, through EGFP-tagging, a plastid membrane localized putative Na+(K+)/H+ antiporter that is significantly upregulated at > 800 ppm CO2, with a potentially important role in maintaining pH homeostasis. Notably, transcript abundance of this antiporter gene was relatively low and constant over the diel cycle under contemporary CO2 conditions. In future acidified oceanic conditions, dramatic oscillations of >10-fold change between nighttime (high) and daytime (low) in transcript abundances of the antiporter gene were associated with increased resilience of T. pseudonana. By analyzing metatranscriptomic data from the Tara Oceans project, we demonstrate that phylogenetically diverse diatoms express homologs of this antiporter across the globe. We propose that the differential between night- and daytime transcript levels of the antiporter could serve as a bioindicator of a shift in the resilience of diatoms in response to high CO2 conditions in marine environments.",

To date, the spatial proteotype of LBs remains unknown. Using the prototypic poxvirus, vaccinia virus (VACV), we employed a quantitative comparative mass spectrometry strategy to determine the poxvirus LB proteome. We identified a large population of cellular proteins, the majority being mitochondrial, and 15 viral LB proteins. Strikingly, one-third of these comprise the full set of VACV redox proteins whose LB residency could be confirmed using super-resolution microscopy. We further show that VACV infection exerts an anti-oxidative effect on host cells and that artificial induction of oxidative stress impacts early gene expression and virion production. In addition to defining the spatial proteotype of these enigmatic viral structures, these findings implicate poxvirus redox proteins as modulators of host oxidative anti-viral responses and provide a solid starting point for future investigations into the role of LB resident proteins in host immunomodulation.",

We report here that spike is trafficked to lysosomes and that the D614G mutation enhances the lysosomal sorting of spike and the lysosomal accumulation of spike-positive punctae in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Spike trafficking to lysosomes is an endocytosis-independent, V-ATPase-dependent process, and spike-containing lysosomes drive lysosome clustering but display poor lysotracker labeling and reduced uptake of endocytosed materials. These results are consistent with a lysosomal pathway of coronavirus biogenesis and raise the possibility that a common mechanism may underly the D614G mutations effects on spike protein trafficking in infected cells and the accelerated entry of SARS-CoV-2 into uninfected cells.",

    "abstract": "Coenzyme Q (CoQ, ubiquinone) is a redox-active lipid essential for many core metabolic processes in mitochondria, including oxidative phosphorylation1-3. While lesser appreciated, CoQ also serves as a key membrane-embedded antioxidant throughout the cell4. However, how CoQ is mobilized from its site of synthesis on the inner mitochondrial membrane to other sites of action remains a longstanding mystery. Here, using a combination of yeast genetics, biochemical fractionation, and lipid profiling, we identify two highly conserved but poorly characterized mitochondrial proteins, Ypl109c (Cqd1) and Ylr253w (Cqd2), that reciprocally regulate this process. Loss of Cqd1 skews cellular CoQ distribution away from mitochondria, resulting in markedly enhanced resistance to oxidative stress caused by exogenous polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), whereas loss of Cqd2 promotes the opposite effects. The activities of both proteins rely on their atypical kinase/ATPase domains, which they share with Coq8--an essential auxiliary protein for CoQ biosynthesis. Overall, our results reveal new protein machinery central to CoQ trafficking in yeast and lend new insights into the broader interplay between mitochondrial and cellular processes.",

Here, we show that capsules constrain phage-mediated gene flow between closely related serotypes in Klebsiella pneumoniae, a high-priority nosocomial enterobacteria. Serotype-specific phage pressure may also explain the inactivation of capsule genes, which occur frequently and recapitulate the capsule biosynthetic pathway. We show that plasmid conjugation is increased upon capsule inactivation and that capsule re-acquisition leaves long recombination tracts around the capsular locus. This suggests that capsule inactivation by phage pressure facilitates its subsequent re-acquisition by conjugation, a process re-wiring gene flow towards novel lineages whenever it leads to serotype swaps. These results reveal the basis of trade-offs between the evolution of virulence and multidrug resistance. They also caution that some alternatives to antibiotic therapy may select for capsule inactivation, thus decreasing virulence but facilitating antibiotic resistance genes acquisition.",

    "abstract": "Seahorses and pipefishes are heavily exploited for use in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and less frequently for curio markets or as aquarium fish. A number of recent studies have used DNA barcoding to identify species sold at TCM markets in East Asia, but the usefulness of this approach in determining the region of origin remains poorly explored. Here, we generated DNA barcodes of dried seahorses and pipefishes destined for TCM that were confiscated at South Africas largest airport because they lacked the export permits required for the CITES-listed seahorses. These were compared with published sequences and new sequences generated for Mozambican seahorses, with the aim of determining whether it is possible to identify their country of origin. All pipefishes were identified as Syngnathoides biaculeatus, a widespread Indo-Pacific species, but the published sequence data did not provide sufficient resolution to identify the region of origin. The same was true of the majority of seahorses, which could not even be identified to species level because they clustered among an unresolved species complex whose sequences were published under the names Hippocampus kuda, H. fuscus and H. capensis. The presence of a few specimens of a second seahorse, H. camelopardalis, suggests that the shipment originated from East Africa because the range of this seahorse is centred around this region, but again, it was not possible to determine their country of origin. Even though seahorses and pipefishes have high levels of genetic population structure because of their low dispersal potential, DNA barcoding was only suitable to tentatively identify species, but not their region of origin. DNA barcoding is increasingly used to identify illegally traded wildlife, but our results show that more sophisticated methods are needed to monitor and police the trade in seahorses and pipefishes.",

The fluorescence of Si-QDs was investigated when combined with TheraTears(R) (a balanced electrolyte formula for dry eye therapy). An optical imaging system composed of a modified slit lamp biomicroscope combined with a high-resolution Zyla sCMOS camera, SOLIS software, custom-made optical mounts and emission filters (460 nm, 510 nm and 530 nm) were used for in vitro imaging of Si-QDs with TheraTears(R). The average size of Si-QDs was 2.65 nm. In vitro imaging of Sc-Si-QDs and Cu-Si-QDs indicated their stable and bright fluorescence with TheraTears(R). Sc-Si-QDs were significantly brighter compared to Cu-Si-QDs and Zn-Si-QDs, and the Zn-Si-QDs showed a tendency to clump in TheraTears(R). The fluorescence of the Si-QDs was detected down to a concentration of 0.01 {micro}g/mL within a total volume of 5 {micro}L. Cu-Si-QDs and Sc-Si-QDs showed brighter fluorescence than Zn-Si-QDs. However, Zn-Si-QDs and to a lesser extent, Cu-Si-QDs showed some aggregation at specific concentrations.

    "abstract": "Single cell measurements are uniquely capable of characterizing cell-to-cell heterogeneity, and have been used to explore the large diversity of cell types and physiological functions present in tissues and other complex cell assemblies. An intriguing application of single cell proteomics is the characterization of proteome dynamics during biological transitions, like cellular differentiation or disease progression. Time course experiments, which regularly take measurements during state transitions, rely on the ability to detect dynamic trajectories in a data series. However, in a single cell proteomics experiment, cell-to-cell heterogeneity complicates the confident identification of proteome dynamics as measurement variability may be higher than expected. Therefore, a critical question for these experiments is how many data points need to be acquired during the time course to enable robust statistical analysis. We present here an analysis of the most important variables that affect statistical confidence in the detection of proteome dynamics: fold-change, measurement variability, and the number of cells measured during the time course. Importantly, we show that datasets with less than 16 measurements across the time domain suffer from low accuracy and also have a high false-positive rate. We also demonstrate how to balance competing demands in experimental design to achieve a desired result.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant problem that affects [~]500,000 children each year. As cell proliferation is disturbed by injury and is required for normal brain development, we investigated how a pediatric closed head injury (CHI) would affect the progenitors of the subventricular zone (SVZ). Additionally, we evaluated the contribution of Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) using LIF-heterozygous mice (LIF Het), as LIF is an injury-induced cytokine, known to influence neurogenesis and gliogenesis. CHIs were performed on P20 LIF Het and WT mice. Ki-67 staining and stereology revealed that cell proliferation increased [~]250% in injured LIF Het mice compared to the 30% increase observed in injured WT mice at 48 h post CHI. Furthermore, Olig2+ cell proliferation increased in the SVZ and white matter of LIF Het injured mice at 48 h recovery. Using an 8-color flow cytometry panel, the proliferation of three distinct multipotential progenitors were greater in LIF Het injured mice compared to WT injured mice. Early oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) proliferation was 6-fold higher in LIF Het injured mice compared to WT injured mice. In vitro, addition of LIF decreased overall cell proliferation and OPC proliferation compared to controls. Addition of LIF to OPC cultures induced an increase of phospho-Akt after 20 minutes and an increase of phospho-S6RP at 20 and 40 minutes of exposure, suggesting that LIF stimulates the mammalian target of Rapamycin pathway. Altogether, our data provide new insights into the regulatory role of LIF in suppressing neural progenitor cell proliferation after a mild TBI.\n\nMain PointsO_LIOPC proliferation is dis-inhibited in LIF haplodeficient mice.\nC_LIO_LILIF directly inhibits glial progenitor cell proliferation.\nC_LIO_LILIF stimulates the mTOR pathway.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The growing problem of antibiotic resistance has led to the exploration of uncultured bacteria as potential sources of new antimicrobials. PCR amplicon analyses and short-read sequencing studies of samples from different environments have reported evidence of high biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) diversity in metagenomes. However, few complete BGCs from uncultivated bacteria have been recovered, making assessment of BGC diversity difficult. Here, long-read sequencing and genome mining were used to recover >1400 mostly complete BGCs that demonstrate the rich diversity of BGCs from uncultivated lineages present in soil from Mars Oasis, Antarctica. The phyla Acidobacteriota, Verrucomicrobiota and Gemmatimonadota, but also the actinobacterial classes Acidimicrobiia, Thermoleophilia, and the gammaproteobacterial order UBA7966, were found to encode a large number of highly divergent BGCs. Our findings underline the biosynthetic potential of underexplored phyla as well as unexplored lineages within seemingly well-studied producer phyla. They also showcase long-read metagenomic sequencing as a promising way to access the untapped reservoir of specialised metabolites of the uncultured majority of microbes.",

    "abstract": "Sulfur cycling is primarily driven by sulfate reduction mediated by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in marine sediments. The dissimilatory sulfate reduction drives the production of enormous quantities of reduced sulfide and thereby the formation of highly insoluble metal sulfides in marine sediments. Here, a novel sulfate-reducing bacterium designated Pseudodesulfovibrio cashew SRB007 was isolated and purified from the deep-sea cold seep and proposed to represent a novel species in the genus of Pseudodesulfovibrio. A detailed description of the phenotypic traits, phylogenetic status and central metabolisms of strain SRB007, allowing the reconstruction of the metabolic potential and lifestyle of a novel member of deep-sea SRB. Notably, P. cashew SRB007 showed a strong ability to resist and remove different heavy metal ions including Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Cd2+ and Hg2+. And the dissimilatory sulfite reduction was demonstrated to contribute to the prominent removal capability of P. cashew SRB007 against different heavy metals via forming insoluble metal sulfides.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe dissimilatory sulfate reduction driven by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) was ubiquitous in marine sediments, and was proposed to couple with heavy metal ions removal through forming insoluble metal sulfides. The deep-sea cold seep is a very special environment where is rich in sulfate and novel species of SRB that possessing many unknown mechanisms toward sulfur cycle. Here, a novel sulfate-reduction bacterium Pseudodesulfovibrio cashew SRB007 was isolated from the deep-sea cold seep and proposed as the type strain for a novel species. The taxonomy and typical physiological properties closely related to sulfur cycle, heavy metal resistance and their co-relationship were disclosed through a combination of genomic and biochemical methods. Given the absence of pure cultures of typical SRB isolated from the deep-sea cold seep, our work provides a good model to study the sulfur cycle which coupling with other elements and a potential candidate to develop bioremediation product in the future.",

    "abstract": "Aquatic ecosystems are often stratified, with cyanobacteria in oxic layers and phototrophic sulfur bacteria in anoxic ones. Changes in stratification caused by global environmental change are an ongoing concern. Increasing understanding how such aerobic and anaerobic microbial communities, and associated abiotic conditions, respond to multifarious environmental changes is an important endeavor in microbial ecology. Insights can come from observational and experimental studies of naturally occurring stratified aquatic ecosystems, from theoretical models of ecological processes, and from experimental studies of replicated microbial communities in the laboratory. Here we demonstrate a laboratory-based approach with small, replicated, and liquid dominated Winogradsky columns, with distinct oxic/anoxic strata in a highly replicable manner. Our objective is to apply simultaneous global change scenarios (temperature, nutrient addition) on this micro-ecosystem to report how the microbial communities (full-length 16SrRNA-seq.) and the abiotic conditions (O2, H2S, TOC) of the oxic/anoxic layer responded to these environmental changes. Composition of the strongly stratified microbial communities was greatly affected by temperature and by the interaction of temperature and nutrient addition, demonstrating the need of investigating global change treatments simultaneously. Especially phototrophic sulfur bacteria dominated the water column at higher temperatures, and may indicate the presence of alternative stable states. We show that the establishment of such a micro-ecosystem has potential to test global change scenarios in stratified eutrophic limnic systems.",

    "abstract": "Streptomyces are among the most prolific bacterial producers of specialized metabolites, including antibiotics. The linear chromosome is partitioned into a central region harboring core genes and two extremities enriched in specialized metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (SMBGCs). The molecular mechanisms governing structure and function of these compartmentalized genomes remain mostly unknown. Here we show that in exponential phase, chromosome structure correlates with genetic compartmentalization: conserved, large and highly transcribed genes form boundaries that segment the central part of the chromosome into domains, whereas the terminal ends are transcriptionally, largely quiescent compartments with different structural features. Onset of metabolic differentiation is accompanied by remodeling of chromosome architecture from an  open to a rather  closed conformation, in which the SMBGCs are expressed forming new boundaries. Altogether, our results reveal that S. ambofaciens linear chromosome is partitioned into structurally distinct entities, indicating a link between chromosome folding, gene expression and genome evolution.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the link between seamounts and large pelagic species (LPS) is critical for guiding management and conservation efforts in open water ecosystems. The seamounts along the Cocos Ridge in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) are thought to play a critical role for LPS moving between Cocos Island (Costa Rica) and Galapagos Islands (Ecuador). However, to date, research efforts to understand pelagic community structure beyond the borders of these oceanic Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been limited. This study used drifting-pelagic baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS) to characterize the distribution and relative abundance of LPS at Cocos Ridge seamounts. Our drifting-pelagic BRUVS detected a total of 21 species including sharks, large teleosts, small teleosts, dolphins and one sea turtle, of which 4 are threatened species. Relative abundance and richness of LPS was significantly higher at shallow seamounts (<400m) compared to deeper ones (>400m) suggesting that seamount depth could be an important driver structuring LPS assemblages along the Cocos Ridge. Our cameras provided the first visual evidence of the schooling behaviour of S. lewini at two shallow seamounts outside the protection limits of Cocos and Galapagos Islands. However, further research is still needed to demonstrate a positive association between LPS and Cocos Ridge seamounts. Our findings showed that drifting pelagic BRUVS are an effective tool to survey LPS in fully pelagic ecosystems of the ETP. This study represents the first step towards the standardization of this technique throughout the region.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundExposure to particulate matter has been shown to increase the adhesion of bacteria to human airway epithelial cells. However, the impact of traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) on the respiratory microbiome is unknown.\n\nMethodsForty children were recruited through the Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study, a longitudinal cohort followed from birth through early adolescence. Saliva and induced sputum were collected at age 14 years. Exposure to TRAP was characterized from birth through the time of sample collection using a previously validated land-use regression model. Sequencing of the bacterial 16S and ITS fungal rRNA genes was performed on sputum and saliva samples. The relative abundance of bacterial taxa and diversity indices were compared in children with exposure to high and low TRAP. We also used multiple linear regression to assess the effect of TRAP exposure, gender, asthma status, and socioeconomic status on the alpha diversity of bacteria in sputum.\n\nResultsWe observed higher bacterial alpha diversity indices in sputum than in saliva. The diversity indices for bacteria were greater in the high TRAP exposure group than the low exposure group. These differences remained after adjusting for asthma status, gender, and mothers education. No differences were observed in the fungal microbiome between TRAP exposure groups.\n\nConclusionOur findings indicate that exposure to TRAP in early childhood and adolescence may be associated with greater bacterial diversity in the lower respiratory tract. Asthma status does not appear to confound the observed differences in diversity. It is still unknown whether the development of asthma changes the lower respiratory tract microbiome or if an altered microbiome mediates a change in disease status. However, these results demonstrate that there may be a TRAP-exposure related change in the lower respiratory microbiota that is independent of asthma status.",

Independently of the reason concerning the enzyme occurrence in animal mitochondria, expression of AOX in human mitochondria is regarded as a potential therapeutic strategy. Till now, relevant data were obtained due to heterologous AOX expression in cells and animals without natively expressed AOX. Application of animals natively expressing AOX importantly contribute the research. Thus, we investigated Hypsibius exemplaris as a model for AOX activity analysis. We observed that H. exemplaris tolerance to the blockage of the MRC complexes was diminished in the presence of AOX inhibitor and the inhibitor-sensitive respiration enabled the tardigrade respiration under condition of the blockage. Furthermore, although detection of AOX at protein level and pronounced oxygraphic registration of its activity required the MRC complex blockage, the obtained data indicated that AOX clearly contributed animal functioning. We demonstrated that AOX activity in tardigrades, can be monitored by measurement of intact specimen whole-body respiration. Furthermore, it was also possible to monitor the impact of the MRC complex IV blockage on AOX expression and AOX inhibition in the absence of the blockage on animal functioning. Thus, H. exemplaris is applied as a whole-animal model suitable to study AOX.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionarily young genes are usually preferentially expressed in the testis across species. While it is known that older genes are generally more broadly expressed than younger genes, the properties that shaped this pattern are unknown. Older genes may gain expression across other tissues uniformly, or faster in certain tissues than others. Using Drosophila gene expression data, we confirmed previous findings that younger genes are disproportionately testis-biased and older genes are disproportionately ovary-biased. We found that the relationship between gene age and expression is stronger in the ovary than any other tissue, and weakest in testis. We performed ATAC-seq on Drosophila testis and found that while genes of all ages are more likely to have open promoter chromatin in testis than in ovary, promoter chromatin alone does not explain the ovary-bias of older genes. Instead, we found that upstream transcription factor (TF) expression is highly predictive of gene expression in ovary, but not in testis. In ovary, TF expression is more predictive of gene expression than open promoter chromatin, whereas testis gene expression is similarly influenced by both TF expression and open promoter chromatin. We propose that the testis is uniquely able to expresses younger genes controlled by relatively few TFs, while older genes with more TF partners are broadly expressed with peak expression most likely in ovary. The testis allows widespread baseline expression that is relatively unresponsive to regulatory changes, whereas the ovary transcriptome is more responsive to trans-regulation and has a higher ceiling for gene expression.",

    "abstract": "The larvae of Odonata are limnic predators capable of catching their prey using a highly modified mouthpart - the labium. Driven by a unique dual catapult mechanism, the apparatus can reach peak accelerations of up to 114.5m/s2. Yet little is known about the kinematics of the predatory strike in an ecological context. Here we show how different ambient temperatures affect the predatory strike and the avoidance reaction of prey items of Odonata larvae. We found that the extension velocity of the labial mask decreases significantly with the ambient temperature both in dragonflies and damselflies. However, temperature has lesser impact on the predatory strike itself than on directly muscle driven movements in both the predator and prey items. This contradicts the previous assumption that catapult mechanisms in insects are unaffected by temperature. Our results indicate that the prehensile labial mask is driven by a series-elastic catapult; a mechanism similar to the temperature dependent jump of frogs, where muscle and spring action are tightly linked. Our study provides novel insights into the predatory strike of Odonata larvae and offers a new ecological perspective on catapult mechanisms in arthropods in general.",

    "abstract": "In many eukaryotes, multiple protein kinases are situated in the plasma membrane where they respond to extracellular ligands. Ligand binding elicits a signal that is transmitted across the membrane, leading to activation of the cytosolic kinase domain. Humans have over 100 receptor protein kinases. In contrast, our search of the Trypanosoma brucei kinome showed that there were only ten protein kinases with predicted transmembrane domains, and unlike other eukaryotic transmembrane kinases, seven are predicted to bear multiple transmembrane domains. Most of the ten kinases, including their transmembrane domains, are conserved in both Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania species. Several possess accessory domains, such as Kelch, nucleotide cyclase, and forkhead-associated domains. Surprisingly, two contain multiple regions with predicted structural similarity to domains in bacterial signaling proteins. A few of the protein kinases have previously been localized to subcellular structures such as endosomes or lipid bodies. We examine here the localization of epitope-tagged versions of seven of the predicted transmembrane kinases in T. brucei bloodstream forms and show that five localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. The last two kinases are integral membrane proteins associated with the flagellum, flagellar pocket, or adjacent structures, as shown by both fluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. Thus, these kinases are positioned in structures suggesting participation in signal transduction from the external environment.",

    "abstract": "During the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, large-scale genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 has been useful in tracking its spread and in identifying Variants Of Concern (VOC). Besides, viral and host factors could contribute to variability within a host that can be captured in next-generation sequencing reads as intra-host Single Nucleotide Variations (iSNVs). Analysing 1, 347 samples collected till June 2020, we recorded 18, 146 iSNV sites throughout the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Both, mutations in RdRp as well as APOBEC and ADAR mediated RNA editing seem to contribute to the differential prevalence of iSNVs in hosts. Noteworthy, 41% of all unique iSNVs were reported as SNVs by 30th September 2020 in samples submitted to GISAID, which increased to [~]80% by 30th June 2021. Following this, analysis of another set of 1, 798 samples sequenced in India between November 2020 and May 2021 revealed that majority of the Delta (B.1.617.2) and Kappa (B.1.617.1) variations appeared as iSNVs before getting fixed in the population. We also observe hyper-editing events at functionally critical residues in Spike protein that could alter the antigenicity and may contribute to immune escape. Thus, tracking and functional annotation of iSNVs in ongoing genome surveillance programs could be important for early identification of potential variants of concern and actionable interventions.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=177 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/417519v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (41K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12b6ac2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16df897org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dbbec2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c8de14_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Ras-specific proteases to degrade RAS within cancer cells are under active development as an innovative strategy to treat tumorigenesis. The naturally occurring biological toxin effector called RAS/RAP1-specific endopeptidase (RRSP) is known to cleave all RAS within a cell, including HRAS, KRAS, NRAS and mutant KRAS G13D. In the course of studies developing RRSP as an anti-cancer therapeutic, it was shown that cleavage of total RAS by RRSP results in a range of cell fates from cytotoxicity to moderate growth inhibition. Despite the considerable amount of evidence demonstrating RRSP anti-tumor effects in vivo, our understanding of the mechanisms involved are unknown. Here, we first demonstrate, using isogenic mouse fibroblasts expressing a single isoform of RAS or mutant KRAS, that RRSP equally inactivates all isoforms of RAS as well as the major oncogenic KRAS mutants. The cleavage of RAS inhibited phosphorylation of ERK and cell proliferation regardless of the RAS isoform. To investigate further how RAS processing might lead to varying outcomes in cell fate within cancer cells, we tested RRSP against four colorectal cancer cell lines with a range of cell fates. While cell lines highly susceptible to RRSP (HCT116 and SW1463) undergo cytotoxic death, RRSP treatment of GP5d cells induces G1 cell cycle arrest, and SW620 cells instead induces growth inhibition through cell senescence. In three of four cell lines tested, growth effects were dictated by rescued expression of the tumor suppressor protein p27 (Kip1). The ability of RRSP to inactivate all RAS and inhibit cancer cell growth through a variety of mechanisms highlights the antitumor potential of RRSP, and further warrants investigation as a potential anti-tumor therapeutic.",

    "abstract": "Depending on the species, bacteria organize their chromosomes with either spatially separated or closely juxtaposed replichores. However, in contrast to eukaryotes, significant changes in bacterial chromosome conformation during the cell cycle have not been demonstrated to date. Streptomyces are unique among bacteria due to their linear chromosomes and complex life cycle. These bacteria develop multigenomic hyphae that differentiate into chains of unigenomic exospores. Only during sporulation-associated cell division, chromosomes are segregated and compacted. In this study, we show that at entry to sporulation, arms of S. venezuelae chromosomes are spatially separated, but they are closely aligned within the core region during sporogenic cell division. Arm juxtaposition is imposed by the segregation protein ParB and condensin SMC. Moreover, we disclose that the chromosomal terminal regions are organized into domains by the Streptomyces-specific protein - HupS. Thus, we demonstrate chromosomal rearrangement from open to close conformation during Streptomyces life cycle.",

    "abstract": "A vast diversity of parasites associate with ants. Living in and around ant nests these organisms must overcome ant colony defenses. As ant defensive behavior is mainly mediated by species-specific cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) or alarm pheromones, ant-associated parasites can either crack their hosts chemical communication code by modifying their own CHC-profiles or use pro-active strategies like chemical weaponry for distraction and repellency. While the chemical nature of ant-parasite interactions has been intensively studied for highly host specific parasites, the chemical-deceptive strategies of the rather rare ant-resembling Heteropterans are unknown. To gain insight into this system, I studied the bug Scolopostethus pacificus (Barber 1918) which can be found near the nests of the ecologically dominant and aggressive velvety tree ant (Liometopum occidentale, Emery 1895). Using behavioral, chemical and molecular approaches I disentangled the relationship of S. pasificus and its host ant. Chemical profiling of the bug and the ant revealed that the bug does not make use of CHC insignificance or mimicry, but instead uses a cocktail of volatile compounds released from its metathoracic glands that likely moderates encounters with its aggressive host. Feeding trials with armed and artificially disarmed bugs revealed a defensive function of the gland exudates. Targeted molecular gut barcoding showed that S. pasificus does not feed on L. occidentale. These results suggest that chemical weaponry, rather than a chemical code-cracking CHC matching or chemical insignificance, enables S. pasificus to get along with and live in close proximity to its host ant.",

    "abstract": "Carpobrotus species are harmful invaders to coastal areas throughout the world, particularly in Mediterranean habitats. Demographic models are ideally suited to identify and understand population processes and stages in the life cycle of the species that could be most effectively targeted with management. However, parameterizing these models has been limited by the difficulty in accessing the cliff-side locations where its populations are typically found, as well as accurately measuring the growth and spread individuals, which form large, dense mats. This study uses small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, drones) to collect demographic data and parameterize an Integral Projection Model of an Israeli Carpobrotus population. We validated our data set with ground targets of known size. Through the analysis of asymptotic growth rates and population sensitivities and elasticities, we demonstrate that the population at the study site is demographically stable, and that reducing the survival and growth of the largest individuals would have the greatest effect on reducing overall population growth rate. Our results provide a first evaluation of the demography of Carpobrotus, a species of conservation and economic concern, and provide the first stage-based population model of a representative of the Aizoaceae family, thus contributing to our global knowledge on plant population dynamics. In addition, we demonstrate the advantages of using drones for collecting demographic data in understudied habitats such as coastal ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have reported the presence of pre-existing humoral or cell-mediated cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 peptides in healthy individuals unexposed to SARS-CoV-2. In particular, the current literature suggests that this pre-existing cross-reactivity could, in part, derive from prior exposure to  common cold endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs). In this study, we characterised the sequence homology of SARS-CoV-2-derived T-cell epitopes reported in the literature across the entire diversity of the Coronaviridae family. Slightly over half (54.8%) of the tested epitopes did not have noticeable homology to any of the human endemic coronaviruses (HKU1, OC43, NL63 and 229E), suggesting prior exposure to these viruses cannot explain the full cross-reactive profiles observed in healthy unexposed individuals. Further, we find that the proportion of cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 epitopes with noticeable sequence homology is extremely well predicted by the phylogenetic distance to SARS-CoV-2 (R2 = 96.6%). None of the coronaviruses sequenced to date showed a statistically significant excess of T-cell epitope homology relative to the proportion of expected random matches given the sequence similarity of their core genome to SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, our results suggest that the repertoire of cross-reactive epitopes reported in healthy adults cannot be primarily explained by prior exposure to any coronavirus known to date, or any related yet-uncharacterised coronavirus.",

    "abstract": "Embryonic specification of the first body axis requires the formation of an Organizer, a group of cells with the ability to instruct fates in the surrounding tissue. The existence of organizing regions in adults, i.e. during regeneration, which also requires patterning of new tissues, remains unstudied. To that aim, we study regeneration in planarians, flatworms that can regenerate any missing structure, even the head, in a few days. In planarians, as described in embryonic models, the cWNT pathway specifies the anterior-posterior axis. During the first 12-24h after amputation both wnt1 and notum (a Wnt inhibitor) are expressed in any wound, but 48 hours later they become restricted to posterior or anterior facing wounds, forming the anterior and the posterior organizers, respectively. In this study we undertook a genomic approach to further understand the mechanism that triggers the early expression of wnt1 and the specification of the posterior identity. Through ATAC-sequencing and CHIPmentation techniques we uncovered Cis-Regulatory Elements of Schmidtea mediterranea genome and analyzed them in notum and wnt1 (RNAi) animals. The result shows that already at 12 hours after amputation the chromatin structure of the wounds has changed its conformation according to the polarity of the pre-existing tissue. Analysing the DNA binding motives present in the proximal regulatory regions of genes down-regulated after wnt1 (RNAi) we found a few genes containing a TCF binding site, which include posterior Homeobox genes and chromatin remodelling proteins, suggesting that those are direct targets of the cWNT pathway and the responsible to trigger the expression of the posterior effectors. Furthermore, we have identified FoxG as an up-stream regulator of wnt1 transcription, probably though binding to an enhancer found in its first intron. Silencing of foxG inhibits the early phase of wnt1 expression and phenocopies the wnt1 (RNAi) phenotype, indicating its early role in specifying posterior versus anterior identity. Moreover, we have created a new open platform to interpret all transcriptomic and genomic results obtained (https://compgen.bio.ub.edu/PlanNET/planexp).",

The effect of somatic mutations accumulated during affinity maturation process on flexibility, stability and affinity of the germline and affinity matured nanobody was studied. Affinity maturation results in loss of local flexibility in CDR of H3 and this resulted in a gain of affinity towards the antigen. Further affinity maturation was found to destabilize the nanobody. Mechanistically the loss of flexibility of the CDR H3 is due to the redistribution of hydrogen bond network due to somatic mutation A50T, also this contributes significantly to the destability of the nanobody. Unlike antibody, in nanobody the framework region is highly conserved and structural diversity in CDR is the determining factor in diverse antigen binding and also a factor contributing to the stability. This study provide insights into the interrelationship between flexibility, stability and affinity during affinity maturation in a nanobody.",

Mice, a prominent visual system model, are dichromatic with enhanced sensitivity to green and UV. Their visual environment, however, is rarely considered. Here, we built a UV-green camera to record footage from mouse habitats. We found chromatic contrast to greatly diverge in the upper but not the lower visual field, an environmental difference that may underlie the species superior colour discrimination in the upper visual field. Moreover, training an autoencoder on upper but not lower visual field scenes was sufficient for the emergence of colour-opponent filters. Furthermore, the upper visual field was biased towards dark UV contrasts, paralleled by more light-offset-sensitive cells in the ventral retina. Finally, footage recorded at twilight suggests that UV promotes aerial predator detection. Our findings support that natural scene statistics shaped early visual processing in evolution.\n\nLead contactFurther information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Thomas Euler (thomas.euler@cin.uni-tuebingen.de)",

    "abstract": "Nanozyme is a collection of nanomaterials with enzyme-like activity but exhibits higher environmental tolerance and long-term stability than their natural counterparts. Improving the catalytic activity and expanding the category of nanozymes are prerequisites to complement or even supersede natural enzymes. Specifically, a powerful hydrolytic nanozyme is demanded to degrade the unsustainable substance which natural enzymes hardly achieve. However, the development of hydrolytic nanozymes is still hindered by diverse hydrolytic substrates and following complicated mechanisms. Here, we apply two strategies which are informed by data to screen and predict catalytic active sites of MOF (metal-organic framework) based hydrolytic nanozymes. One is to increase the intrinsic activity by finely tuned Lewis acidity of the metal clusters. The other is to adjust the volume density of the active sites by shortening the length of ligands. Finally, we construct a Ce-FMA-MOF-based hydrolytic nanozyme with robust cleavage ability towards phosphate bonds, amide bonds, glycosidic bonds whose energy ascend in order; and even their mixture, biofilms. This work provides a rational methodology to design hydrolytic nanozyme, enriches the diversity of nanozymes, and potentially sheds a light on the evolution of enzyme engineering in the future.",

    "abstract": "Determining gene function is an essential goal for the key bioenergy crop, Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench - particularly for genes associated with its notable abiotic stress tolerances. However, detailed molecular understanding of the genes associated with those traits is limited. This was made clear in our in-depth transcriptome studies in sorghum, which indicated nearly 50% of its transcriptome is not annotated. In this report, we describe a full spectrum of tools needed to transform sorghum in order to validate and annotate genes. Efforts began with modifying a transformation method that uses the morphogenic genes Baby Boom and Wuschel2 (Ovule Development Protein2) to accelerate transformation speed and expand amenable genotypes. In our experience, transforming RTx430 without morphogenic genes requires ~18 to 21 weeks, compared with ~10 to 12 weeks to generate T0 plants using methods with morphogenic genes. Utilizing morphogenic genes also allowed for the transformation of several sorghum genotypes not previously transformed or historically recalcitrant to transformation, i.e., rapid cycling SC187, stay-green BTx642, BTx623 and sweet sorghum Ramada. In order to validate candidate genes via engineering, while simultaneously introducing the morphogenic genes, a co-transformation strategy, termed altruistic transformation, was developed. To accomplish editing of the target gene, phytoene desaturase, novel constructs were created that also included morphogenic genes. To enable full characterization of transformed plants, we adapted techniques to determine copy number and independence of events at high-throughput levels. Through these efforts, we created a complete pathway from Agrobacterium infection to high-throughput molecular genotyping that can be used to ascertain gene function and expedite basic genetic research in this widely-grown bioenergy crop plant.",

    "abstract": "Branched-chain amino acid metabolism has emerged as a crucial regulator of tumor proliferation. In particular, the branched-chain amino acid transaminase 1 (BCAT1), which catalyzes the conversion of branched-chain amino acids to -keto acids in the cytoplasm, has been identified as a promising therapeutic target for several different cancer types, including gliomas and leukemias. BCAT1 expression has also been associated with resistance to anti-estrogen therapy in breast cancer, suggesting a role in therapeutic resistance and tumor progression. Yet a functional role for BCAT1 in promoting breast cancer recurrence has not been described. Further, BCAT1 expression is restricted to just a few specialized tissues, such as the testes and central nervous system, and the mechanism by which it becomes transcriptionally activated in tumors that arise from tissues that do not typically express BCAT1 is unclear. Here, we report that Bcat1 is upregulated in recurrent breast tumors to promote recurrent tumor growth. We find that Bcat1 is upregulated by the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in mammary epithelial cells and breast cancer cells. Finally, we analyze human tumor datasets to show that BCAT1 expression is strongly correlated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal gene signatures, suggesting that EMT is the predominant regulator of BCAT1 expression in cancer. Because EMT is associated with therapy resistance, metastasis, and tumor recurrence, these findings suggest a broad clinical potential for BCAT1 inhibition.",

We have applied a Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) strategy to investigate structural changes in the lever arm domain of human {beta}-cardiac myosin subfragment 1 (M2{beta}-S1). We exchanged the human ventricular regulatory light chain labeled at a single cysteine (V105C) with Alexa 488 onto M2{beta}-S1, which served as a donor for Cy3ATP bound to the active site. We monitored the FRET signal during the actin-activated product release steps using transient kinetic stopped-flow measurements. We proposed that the fast phase measured with our FRET probes represents the structural change associated with rotation of the lever arm during the power stroke in M2{beta}-S1. Our results demonstrated human cardiac muscle myosin has a slower power stroke compared with fast skeletal muscle myosin and myosin V. Measurements at different temperatures comparing the rate constants of the power stroke and phosphate release revealed that the power stroke occurs before phosphate release, and the two steps are tightly coupled. We speculate that the slower power stroke rate constant in cardiac myosin may correlate with the slower force development and/or unique thin filament activation properties in cardiac muscle. Additionally, we demonstrated that HCM (R723G) and DCM (F764L) associated mutations both reduced actin-activation of the power stroke in M2{beta}-S1. We also demonstrate that both mutations decrease ensemble force development in the loaded in vitro motility assay. Thus, examining the structural kinetics of the power stroke in M2{beta}-S1 has revealed critical mutation-associated defects in the myosin ATPase pathway, suggesting these measurements will be extremely important for establishing structure-based mechanisms of contractile dysfunction.\n\nSignificanceMutations in human beta-cardiac myosin are known to cause various forms of heart disease, while it is unclear how the mutations lead to contractile dysfunction and pathogenic remodeling of the heart. In this study, we investigated two mutations with opposing phenotypes and examined their impact on ATPase cycle kinetics, structural changes associated with the myosin power stroke, and ability to slide actin filaments in the presence of load. We found that both mutations impair the myosin power stroke and other key kinetic steps as well as the ability to produce ensemble force. Thus, our results provide a structural basis for how mutations disrupt molecular level contractile dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Endosymbioses have shaped the evolutionary trajectory of life and remain widespread and ecologically important. Investigating modern oceanic photosymbioses can illuminate how algal endosymbionts are energetically exploited by their heterotrophic hosts, and inform on putative initial steps of plastid acquisition in eukaryotes. By combining 3D subcellular imaging with photophysiology, carbon flux imaging and transcriptomics, we show that cell division of algal endosymbionts (Phaeocystis) is blocked within hosts (Acantharia), and that their cellular architecture and bioenergetic machinery are radically altered. Transcriptional evidence indicates that a nutrient-independent mechanism prevents symbiont cell division and decouples nuclear and plastid division. As endosymbiont plastids proliferate, the volume of the photosynthetic machinery volume increases 100-fold in correlation with expansion of a reticular mitochondrial network in close proximity to plastids. Photosynthetic efficiency tends to increase with cell size and photon propagation modeling indicates that the networked mitochondrial architecture enhances light capture. This is accompanied by 150-fold higher carbon uptake and upregulation of genes involved in photosynthesis and carbon fixation, which, in conjunction with a ca.15-fold size increase of pyrenoids demonstrates enhanced primary production in symbiosis. NanoSIMS analysis revealed major carbon allocation to plastids and transfer to the host cell. Invagination of the symbiosome into endosymbionts to optimize metabolic exchanges is strong evidence that the algal metamorphosis is irreversible. Hosts therefore trigger and unambiguously benefit from major bioenergetic remodeling of symbiotic microalgae with important consequences for the oceanic carbon cycle. Unlike other photosymbioses, this interaction represents a so-called cytoklepty, which is a putative initial step towards plastid acquisition.",

    "abstract": "The pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus in 2020 has led to a global public health emergency, and non-pharmaceutical interventions required to limit the viral spread are severely affecting health and economies across the world. A vaccine providing rapid and persistent protection across populations is urgently needed to prevent disease and transmission. We here describe the development of novel COVID-19 DNA plasmid vaccines encoding homodimers consisting of a targeting unit that binds chemokine receptors on antigen-presenting cells (human MIP-1 /LD78{beta}), a dimerization unit (derived from the hinge and CH3 exons of human IgG3), and an antigenic unit (Spike or the receptor-binding domain (RBD) from SARS-CoV-2). The candidate encoding the longest RBD variant (VB2060) demonstrated high secretion of a functional protein and induced rapid and dose-dependent RBD IgG antibody responses that persisted up to at least 3 months after a single dose of the vaccine in mice. Neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers against the live virus were detected from day 7 after one dose. All tested dose regimens reached titers that were higher or comparable to those seen in sera from human convalescent COVID-19 patients from day 28. T cell responses were detected already at day 7, and were subsequently characterized to be multifunctional CD8+ and Th1 dominated CD4+ T cells. Responses remained at sustained high levels until at least 3 months after a single vaccination, being further strongly boosted by a second vaccination at day 89. These findings, together with the simplicity and scalability of plasmid DNA manufacturing, safety data on the vaccine platform in clinical trials, low cost of goods, data indicating potential long term storage at +2{degrees} to 8{degrees}C and simple administration, suggests the VB2060 candidate is a promising second generation candidate to prevent COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Integrated valve microfluidics has an unparalleled capability to automate the rapid delivery of fluids at the nanoliter scale for high-throughput biological experimentation. However, multilayer soft lithography, which is used to fabricate valve-microfluidics, produces devices with a minimum thickness of around five millimeters. This form-factor limitation prevents the use of such devices in experiments with limited sample thickness tolerance such as 4-pi microscopy, stimulated Raman scattering microscopy, and many forms of optical or magnetic tweezer applications. We present a new generation of integrated valve microfluidic devices that are less than 300 m thick, including the cover-glass substrate, that resolves the thickness limitation. This \"thin-chip\" was fabricated through a novel soft-lithography technique that produces on-chip micro-valves with the same functionality and reliability of traditional thick valve-microfluidic devices despite the orders of magnitude reduction in thickness. We demonstrated the advantage of using our thin-chip over traditional thick devices to automate fluid control while imaging on a high-resolution inverted microscope. First, we demonstrate that the thin-chip provides improved signal to noise when imaging single cells with two-color stimulated Raman scattering (SRS). We then demonstrated how the thin-chip can be used to simultaneously perform on-chip magnetic manipulation of beads and fluorescent imaging. This study reveals the potential of our thin-chip in high-resolution imaging, sorting, and bead capture-based single-cell multi-omics applications.",

    "abstract": "Shigella species causes shigellosis that requires antibiotic treatment in severe cases. Sub-lethal antibiotic concentrations can promote resistance, but their effect on antibiotic-sensitive bacteria prior to resistance development is unknown. This study investigated the effects of sublethal norfloxacin challenges on a norfloxacin-sensitive strain Shigella sonnei UKMCC1015. We show that low levels of norfloxacin do not change the antimicrobial resistance genes and norfloxacin targets expression. Instead, multiple ribosomal protein genes were downregulated.which could beattributed to a decrease in the ribosomal protein promoter activity, modulated by ppGpp. Under sublethal norfloxacin stress and high ppGpp levels, the cells underwent filamentation suggesting that ppGpp regulates the response of S. sonnei to norfloxacinWe speculate that high ppGpp levels play roles in modulating the developmentof antibiotic resistance in the sensitive strain. Indeed, the adaptive evolution of UKMCC1015 in the presence of norfloxacin revealed that the evolved strain 5c developed a mutation in gyrA (Asp87Tyr) gene conferring reduced norfloxacin susceptibility and reduced filamentation. These results collectively suggest that ppGpp may not be involved in regulating the mutants response to norfloxacin exposure.\n\nData SummaryThe complete genome of Shigella sonnei UKMCC1015 and its plasmids have been deposited at GenBank under accession numbers CP060117, CP060118 and CP060119.

    "abstract": "Vascularization is critical for skull development, maintenance, and healing. Yet, there remains a significant knowledge gap in the relationship of blood vessels to cranial skeletal progenitors during these processes. Here, we introduce a quantitative 3D imaging platform to enable visualization and analysis of high-resolution datasets (>100 GB) throughout the entire murine calvarium. Using this technique, we provide single-cell resolution 3D maps of vessel phenotypes and skeletal progenitors in the frontoparietal cranial bones. Through these high-resolution datasets, we demonstrate that CD31hiEmcnhi vessels are spatially correlated with both Osterix+ and Gli1+ skeletal progenitors during postnatal growth, healing, and stimulated remodeling, and are concentrated at transcortical canals and osteogenic fronts. Interestingly, this relationship was weakened in mice with a conditional knockout of PDGF-BB in TRAP+ osteoclasts, suggesting a potential role for osteoclasts in maintaining the native cranial microvascular environment. Our findings provide a foundational framework for understanding how blood vessels and skeletal progenitors spatially interact in cranial bone, and will enable more targeted studies into the mechanisms of skull disease pathologies and treatments. Additionally, our technique can be readily adapted to study numerous cell types and investigate other elusive phenomena in cranial bone biology.",

The formation and topology of filamentous mHTT inclusions in the brain (hallmarks of HD implicated in neurotoxicity) remain elusive. Using cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging, here we show that mHTT exon 1 and polyQ-only aggregates in vitro are structurally heterogenous and filamentous, similar to prior observations with other methods. Yet, we observed some filaments in both types of aggregates under [~]2 nm in width, thinner than previously reported, while other regions form large sheets. In addition, our data show a prevalent subpopulation of filaments exhibiting a lumpy, slab-shaped morphology in both aggregates, supportive of the \"polyQ core\" model. This provides a basis for future cryoET studies of various aggregated mHTT and polyQ constructs to improve their structure-based modeling and their identification in cells without fusion tags.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus agalactiae evasion from the human defense mechanisms has been linked to the production of DNases. These were proposed to contribute to the hypervirulence of S. agalactiae ST17/capsular-type III strains, mostly associated with neonatal meningitis. We performed a comparative genomic analysis between ST17 and ST19 human strains with different cell tropism and distinct DNase production phenotypes. All S. agalactiae ST17 strains, with the exception of 2211-04, were found to display DNase activity, while the opposite scenario was observed for ST19, where 1203-05 was the only DNase(+) strain. The analysis of the genetic variability of the seven genes putatively encoding secreted DNases in S. agalactiae revealed an exclusive amino acid change in the predicted signal peptide of GBS0661 (NucA) of the ST17 DNase(-), and an exclusive amino acid change alteration in GBS0609 of the ST19 DNase(+) strain. Further core-genome analysis identified some specificities (SNVs or indels) differentiating the DNase(-) ST17 2211-04 and the DNase(+) ST19 1203-05 from the remaining strains of each ST. The pan-genomic analysis evidenced an intact phage without homology in S. agalactiae and a transposon homologous to TnGBS2.3 in ST17 DNase(-) 2211-04; the transposon was also found in one ST17 DNase(+) strain, yet with a different site of insertion. A group of nine accessory genes were identified among all ST17 DNase(+) strains, including the Eco47II family restriction endonuclease and the C-5 cytosine-specific DNA methylase. None of these loci was found in any DNase(-) strain, which may suggest that these proteins might contribute to the lack of DNase activity. In summary, we provide novel insights on the genetic diversity between DNase(+) and DNase(-) strains, and identified genetic traits, namely specific mutations affecting predicted DNases (NucA and GBS0609) and differences in the accessory genome, that need further investigation as they may justify distinct DNase-related virulence phenotypes in S. agalactiae.",
