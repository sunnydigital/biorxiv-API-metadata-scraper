    "abstract": "Genome remethylation is essential for mammalian development but specific reasons are unclear. Here we examined embryonic stem (ES) cell fate in the absence of de novo DNA methyltransferases. We observed that ES cells deficient for both Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are rapidly eliminated from chimaeras. On further investigation we found that in vivo and in vitro the formative pluripotency transition is derailed towards production of trophoblast. This aberrant trajectory is associated with failure to suppress activation of Ascl2. Ascl2 encodes a bHLH transcription factor expressed in placenta. Misexpression of Ascl2 in ES cells provokes transdifferentiation to trophoblast-like cells. Conversely, Ascl2 deletion rescues formative transition of Dnmt3a/b mutants and improves contribution to chimaeric epiblast. Thus, de novo DNA methylation safeguards against ectopic activation of Ascl2. However, Dnmt3a/b-deficient cells remain defective in ongoing embryogenesis. We surmise that multiple developmental transitions may be secured by DNA methylation silencing potentially disruptive genes.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTMammalian DNA is widely modified by methylation of cytosine residues. This modification is added to DNA during early development. If methylation is prevented, the embryo dies by mid-gestation with multiple abnormalities. In this study we found that stem cells lacking the DNA methylation enzymes do not differentiate efficiently into cell types of the embryo and are diverted into producing placental cells. This switch in cell fate is driven by a transcription factor, Ascl2, which should only be produced in placenta. In the absence of DNA methylation, the Ascl2 gene is mis-expressed. Removing Ascl2 redirects embryonic fate but not full differentiation potential, suggesting that methylation acts at multiple developmental transitions to restrict activation of disruptive genes.",

    "abstract": "We showed recently that the germinal centre kinase III (GCKIII) SmKIN3 from the fungus Sordaria macrospora is involved in sexual development and hyphal septation. Our recent extensive global proteome and phosphoproteome analysis revealed that SmKIN3 is a target of the striatin interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) multi-subunit complex. Here, using protein samples from wild type and three STRIPAK mutants, we applied absolute quantification by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) to analyze phosphorylation site occupancy in SmKIN3 and other septation initiation network (SIN) components, such as CDC7 and DBF2, as well as BUD4, acting downstream of SIN. For SmKIN3, we show that phosphorylation of S668 and S686 is decreased in mutants lacking distinct subunits of STRIPAK, while a third phosphorylation site, S589, was not affected. We constructed SmKIN3 mutants carrying phospho-mimetic and phospho-deficient codons for phosphorylation sites S589, S668 and S686. Investigation of hyphae in a {Delta}SmKin3 strain complemented by the S668 and S686 mutants showed a hyper-septation phenotype, which was absent in the wild type, the {Delta}SmKin3 strain complemented with wild type gene, or the mutant S589. Furthermore, localization studies with SmKIN3 phosphorylation variants and STRIPAK mutants showed that SmKIN3 preferentially localizes at the terminal septa, which is distinctly different from the wild type strains. We conclude that STRIPAK-dependent phosphorylation of SmKIN3 has an impact on controlled septum formation and on the time-dependent localization of SmKIN3 on septa at the hyphal tip. Thus, STRIPAK seems to regulate SmKIN3, as well as DBF2 and BUD4 phosphorylation, affecting septum formation.",

    "abstract": "Invasive species are globally on the rise due to human-induced environmental change and are often a source of harm to their new ecosystems. Tracking the spread of invaders is crucial to better management of invasive species, and citizen science is often used to collect sighting data. However, this can be unreliable due to the general publics limited expertise for accurate identification and a lack of clear absence data. Here, we introduce a refined method of citizen science by tracking the spread of the invasive lionfish (Pterois miles) in the Mediterranean Sea using dive centers expertise on local marine wildlife. We contacted 1131 dive centers on the Mediterranean coast via email and received 216 responses reporting whether or not lionfish were present in their area and, if present, the year they were first sighted. Currently, lionfish sightings are observed in the eastern half of the Mediterranean, though the front is continuing to move west with the furthest sighting as far as Corfu, Greece (19.939423{degrees}E, 39.428017{degrees}N). In 2020, lionfish also expanded their invasive range north on the Turkish Aegean coast to Karaburun (26.520657{degrees}E, 38.637033{degrees}N), showing that the invasion is ongoing. We found that the invasive range is now exceeding previous invasion models, highlighting the need for additional research on lionfish biology to inform management efforts. Continuous monitoring of invasive fronts based on dive center reports and a better understanding of what makes lionfish so invasive is crucial to mitigating their negative impact on native ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMost insects are relatively short-lived, with a maximum lifespan of a few weeks, like the aging model organism, the fruit-fly Drosophila melanogaster. By contrast, the queens of social insects (termites, ants, some bees and wasps) can live for more than a decade. This makes social insects promising new models in aging research providing insights into how a long reproductive life can be achieved. Yet, aging studies on social insect reproductives are hampered by a lack of quantitative data on age-dependent survival and time series analyses that cover the whole lifespan of such long-lived individuals. We studied aging in queens of the drywood termite Cryptotermes secundus by determining survival probabilities over more than 15 years and performed transcriptome analyses for queens of known age that covered their whole lifespan.\n\nResultsThe maximum lifespan of C. secundus queens was 13 years with a median maximum longevity of 11.0 years. Time course and co-expression network analyses of gene expression patterns over time indicated a non-gradual aging pattern. It was characterized by networks of genes that became differentially expressed only late in life, namely after an age of 10 years, which associates well with the median maximum lifespan for queens. These old-age gene networks reflect processes of physiological upheaval. We detected strong signs of stress, decline, defence and repair at the transcriptional level of epigenetic control as well as at the post-transcriptional level with changes in transposable element activity and the proteostasis network. The latter depicts an upregulation of protein degradation, together with protein synthesis and protein folding, processes which are often down-regulated in old animals. The simultaneous upregulation of protein synthesis and autophagy is indicative for a stress-response mediated by the transcription factor cnc, a homolog of human nrf genes.\n\nConclusionOur results show non-linear senescence with a rather sudden physiological upheaval at old-age. Most importantly, they point to a re-wiring in the proteostatis network as central for explaining the long life of social insect queens.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCodon usage bias (CUB), the non-uniform usage of synonymous codons, occurs across all domains of life. Adaptive CUB is hypothesized to result from selection for efficient ribosome elongation, accurate translation, mRNA secondary structure, and/or protein folding. Given the critical link between protein folding and protein function, numerous studies have analyzed the relationship between codon usage and protein structure. The results from these studies have often been contradictory, likely reflecting the differing methods used for measuring codon usage and the failure to appropriately control for confounding factors, such as differences in amino acid usage between protein structures and changes in the frequency of different structures with gene expression.\n\nResultsHere we take an explicit population genetics approach to quantify codon-specific shifts in natural selection related to protein structure. As a result, our approach avoids the problem of needing to choose a specific metric of codon usage, naturally takes amino acid usage of a region into account, and explicitly takes variation in gene expression into account. Our results reveal a weak relationship between codon usage and protein structure, indicating that differences in selection between structures are subtle and/or intermittent. While the magnitude of differences in selection are slight, our results indicate the relationship between codon usage and protein structure is more complex than previously believed.\n\nConclusionsWhile our results clearly indicate that selection on codon usage shifts between secondary structure, the overall impact of these shifts on codon usage are small. Nevertheless, our work demonstrates the statistical power and benefits of studying selective shifts on codon usage or other genomic features from an explicitly evolutionary approach. Limitations of this approach are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies proposed that enzyme active sites induce evolutionary constraints at long distances. The physical origin of such long-range evolutionary coupling is unknown. Here, I use a recent biophysical model of evolution to study the relationship between physical and evolutionary couplings on a diverse data set of monomeric enzymes. I show that evolutionary coupling is not universally long-range. Rather, range varies widely among enzymes, from 2[A] to 20[A]. Furthermore, the evolutionary coupling range of an enzyme does not inform on the underlying physical coupling, which is short-range for all enzymes. Rather, evolutionary coupling range is determined by functional selection pressure.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEUntil recently, only residues near enzyme active sites were thought to be evolutionarily constrained. However, recent studies proposed that active sites induce long-range evolutionary constraints. This seems to conflict with the common finding that physical couplings in proteins are short-range. This raises the question of how short-range physical couplings may cause long-range evolutionary couplings. Here, I show that the function that maps physical coupling into evolutionary coupling depends on functional selection pressure. Under weak selection, both couplings are similarly short-range; under strong selection, short-range physical coupling is non-linearly turned into long-range evolutionary coupling. Thus, due to a huge variation of selection pressure, evolutionary coupling range varies widely among enzymes, from very short (2 [A]) to very long (20 [A]).",

    "abstract": "The study of the reproductive biology of lichen fungal symbionts has been traditionally challenging due to their complex and symbiotic lifestyles. Against the common belief of haploidy, a recent genomic study found a triploid-like signal in Letharia. Here, we used genomic data from a pure culture and from thalli, together with a PCR survey of the MAT locus, to infer the genome organization and reproduction in Letharia. We found that the read count variation in the four Letharia specimens, including the pure culture derived from a single sexual spore of L. lupina, is consistent with haploidy. By contrast, the L. lupina read counts from a thallus metagenome are triploid-like. Characterization of the mating-type locus revealed a conserved heterothallic configuration across the genus, along with auxiliary genes that we identified. We found that the mating-type distributions are balanced in North America for L. vulpina and L. lupina, suggesting widespread sexual reproduction, but highly skewed in Europe for L. vulpina, consistent with predominant asexuality. Taken together, we propose that Letharia fungi are heterothallic and typically haploid, and provide evidence that triploid-like individuals are rare hybrids between L. lupina and an unknown Letharia lineage, reconciling classic systematic and genetic studies with recent genomic observations.",

    "abstract": "A common model to describe natural selection at the molecular level is the nearly neutral theory, which emphasizes the importance of mutations with slightly deleterious fitness effects as they have a chance to get fixed due to genetic drift. Since genetic drift is stronger in smaller than in larger populations, a negative relationship between molecular measures of selection and population size is expected within the nearly neutral theory. Originally, this hypothesis was formulated under equilibrium conditions. A change in population size, however, pushes the selection-drift balance off equilibrium leading to alterations in the efficacy of selection. To investigate the nonequilibrium behavior, we relate measures of natural selection and genetic drift to each other, considering both, measures of micro- and macroevolution. Specifically, we use a Poisson random field framework to model{pi} N/{pi}S and{omega} as time-dependent measures of selection and assess genetic drift by an effective population size. This analysis reveals a clear deviation from the expected equilibrium selection-drift balance during nonequilibrium periods. Moreover, we find that microevolutionary measures quickly react to a change in population size and reflect a recent change well, at the same time as they quickly lose the knowledge about it. Macroevolutionary measures, on the other hand, react more slowly to a change in population size but instead capture the influence of ancient changes longer. We therefore conclude that it is important to be aware of the different behaviors of micro- and macroevo- lutionary measures when making inference in empirical studies, in particular when comparing results between studies.",

    "abstract": "What the molecular mechanisms underlying the evolutionary origin of novel cell types are is a major unresolved question in biology. The uterine decidual cell is a novel cell type of placental mammals which serves as the interface between maternal and fetal tissues during pregnancy. In this paper, we investigate two models for the nature of the differentiation of decidual cells: first, that it represents a mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET), and second, that it evolved from wound-induced fibroblast activation (WIFA). Immunocytochemistry and RNA-seq analysis of decidualizing human endometrial fibroblasts cast doubt on the MET hypothesis and instead demonstrate a similarity between decidualization and fibroblast activation, including a central role for TGFB1. Through single-cell RNA-seq, we found a transient myofibroblast-like cell population in the in vitro differentiation trajectory of human decidual cells and found that these cells represent a pre-decidual state approaching the inferred transcriptomic transition to decidual cells. We propose an evolutionary developmental model wherein the decidual cell is a novel cell type not equivalent to the myofibroblast, but the process of decidual differentiation itself evolved as an endometrial-specific modification to fibroblast activation in response to the wound caused by embryo implantation.",

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, multiparental populations have become a mainstay of genetics research in diploid species. Our goal was to extend this paradigm to autotetraploids by developing software for quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in connected F1 populations derived from a set of shared parents. For QTL discovery, phenotypes are regressed on the dosage of parental haplotypes to estimate additive effects. Statistical properties of the model were explored by simulating half-diallel diploid and tetraploid populations with different population sizes and numbers of parents. Across scenarios, the number of progeny per parental haplotype (pph) largely determined the statistical power for QTL detection and accuracy of the estimated haplotype effects. Multi-allelic QTL with heritability 0.2 were detected with 90% probability at 25 pph and genome-wide significance level 0.05, and the additive haplotype effects were estimated with over 90% accuracy. Following QTL discovery, the software enables a comparison of models with multiple QTL and non-additive effects. To illustrate, we analyzed potato tuber shape in a half-diallel population with 3 tetraploid parents. A well-known QTL on chromosome 10 was detected, for which the inclusion of digenic dominance lowered the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) by 17 points compared to the additive model. The final model also contained a minor QTL on chromosome 1, but higher order dominance and epistatic effects were excluded based on the DIC. In terms of practical impacts, the software is already being used to select offspring based on the effect and dosage of particular haplotypes in breeding programs.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionClimate change has devastating effects on livestock production and productivity, which could threaten livestock-based food security in pastoral and agro-pastoral production systems of the tropics and sub-tropics. Hence, to sustain livestock production in an environment challenged by climate change, the animals must have the ability to survive and produce under extreme conditions. Boran cattle breed is one of the hardiest Zebu cattle reared by Borana Oromo pastoralists for milk and meat production. This paper aims to compile the main production, reproduction and adaptation traits of Boran cattle based on systematic review amd meta-analysis of peer reviewed and published articles on the subject.\n\nMethodologyCombination of systematic review and meta-analysis based on PRISMA guideline was employed. Accordingly, out of 646 recorded articles identified through database searching, 64 were found to be eligible for production, reproduction and adaptation characteristics of the Boran cattle, twenty-eight articles were included in qualitative systematic review while 36 articles were used for quantitative meta-analysis.\n\nResultBoran cattle have diversity of adaptation (morphological, physiological, biochemical, metabolic, cellular and molecular) responses to the effects of climate change induced challenges - notably high temperature and solar radiation, rangeland degradation, seasonal feed and water shortages and high incidences of tropical diseases. Meta-analysis using a random-effects model showed estimates of heritability and genetic correlations for reproduction and production traits. In addition, heritability and genetic-correlation estimates found in the present study suggest that there is high genetic variability for most traits in Boran cattle, and that genetic improvement is possible for all studied traits in this breed.\n\nConclusionThe review revealed that Boran cattle exhibit better reproduction, production and adaption potentials as compared to other indigenous zebu cattle breeds in Ethiopia under low-land, poor pasture and water conditions. On other hand, the breed is currently challenged by adverse effects of climate change and other management factors such as high rate of genetic dilution, reduced rangeland productivity, lack of organized breed improvement programs and discriminate selection of gene pool. Thus, we recommend strategic breed improvement and genetic conservation program of Boran cattle breed in collaboration with Borana pastoralists through proper quantification of important traits and estimation of the pure Boran cattle population while controlled cross breeding strategy could be used in urban and peri-urban areas for maximum utilization of adapataion and production pottential of this breed.",

    "abstract": "Low levels of sample contamination with other human DNAs can have disastrous effects on the accurate identification of somatic variation in tumor samples. Detection of sample contamination in DNA is often based on low frequency variants that indicate if more than a single source of DNA is present. This strategy works with standard DNA samples but can be problematic in solid tumor FFPE samples because there are often huge variations in allele frequency (AF) due to copy number changes arising from gains and losses across the genome. The variable AFs make detection of contamination challenging. To avoid this, we counted microhaplotypes to assess sample contamination. Microhaplotypes are sets of variants on the same sequencing read that can be unambiguously phased. Instead of measuring AF, the number of microhaplotypes is determined. Contamination detection becomes based on fundamental genomic properties, linkage disequilibrium (LD) and the diploid nature of human DNA, rather than variant frequencies. We optimized microhaplotype panel content and selected 164 SNV sets located in regions already being sequenced within a cancer panel. Thus, contamination detection uses existing sequence data. LD data from the 1000 Genomes Project is used to make the panel ancestry agnostic, providing the same sensitivity for contamination detection with samples from individuals of African, East Asian, and European ancestry. Detection of 1% contamination with no matching normal sample is possible. The methods described here can also be extended to other DNA mixtures such as forensic and non-invasive prenatal testing samples where DNA mixes can be similarly detected. The microhaplotype method allows sensitive detection of DNA contamination in FFPE tumor and other samples when deep coverage with Illumina or other high accuracy NGS is used.",

    "abstract": "During the last decade, large volumes of ancient DNA (aDNA) data have been generated as part of whole-genome shotgun and target capture sequencing studies. This includes sequences from non-recombining loci such as the mitochondrial or Y chromosomes. However, given the highly degraded nature of aDNA data, post-mortem deamination and often low genomic coverage, combining ancient and modern samples for phylogenetic analyses remains difficult. Without care, these factors can lead to incorrect placement.\n\nFor the Y chromosomes, current standard methods focus on curated markers, but these contain only a subset of the total variation. Examining all polymorphic markers is particularly important for low coverage aDNA data because it substantially increases the number of overlapping sites between present-day and ancient individuals which may lead to higher resolution phylogenetic placement. We provide an automated workflow for jointly analysing ancient and present-day sequence data in a phylogenetic context. For each ancient sample, we effectively evaluate the number of ancestral and derived alleles present on each branch and use this information to place ancient lineages to their most likely position in the phylogeny. We provide both a parsimony approach and a highly optimised likelihood-based approach that assigns a posterior probability to each branch.\n\nTo illustrate the application of this method, we have compiled and make available the largest public Y-chromosomal dataset to date (2,014 samples) which we used as a reference for phylogenetic placement. We process publicly available African ancient DNA Y-chromosome sequences and examine how patterns of Y-chromosomal diversity change across time and the relationship between ancient and present-day lineages. The same software can be used to place samples with large amounts of missing data into other large non-recombining phylogenies such as the mitochondrial tree.",

    "abstract": "Retracing microbial emergence and spread is essential to understanding the evolution and dynamics of pathogens. The bacterial foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes clonal complex 1 (Lm-CC1) is the most prevalent clonal group associated with listeriosis, and is strongly associated with cattle and dairy products. Here we analysed 2,021 Lm-CC1 isolates collected from 40 countries, since the first Lm isolation to the present day, to define its evolutionary history and population dynamics. Our results suggest that Lm-CC1 spread worldwide from North America following the Industrial Revolution through two waves of expansion, coinciding with the transatlantic livestock trade in the second half of the 19th century and the rapid growth of cattle farming in the 20th century. Lm-CC1 then firmly established at a local level, with limited inter-country spread. This study provides an unprecedented insight into Lm-CC1 phylogeography and dynamics and can contribute to effective disease surveillance to reduce the burden of listeriosis.",

In the present work we show that the crab Neohelice granulata can be trained to associate a specific environment with an appetitive reward in a conditioned place preference task. After a single training trial, when the crabs were presented with a food pellet in the target quadrant of the training arena, they were able to form a long-term memory related to the event. This memory was evident at least 24 h after training and was protein-synthesis dependent. Importantly, the target area of the arena proved to be a non-neutral environment, given that animals initially avoided the target quadrant. In the present work we introduce for the first time an associative one-trial memory paradigm including a conditioned stimulus with a clear valence performed in a crustacean.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of the proximate and ultimate mechanisms shaping competitive phenotypes primarily stems from research on male-male competition for mates, even though female-female competition is also widespread. Obligate secondary cavity-nesting has evolved repeatedly across avian lineages, providing a useful comparative context to explore how competition over limited nest cavities shapes aggression and its underlying mechanisms across species. Although evidence from one or another cavity-nesting species suggests that territorial aggression is adaptive in both females and males, this has not yet been tested in a comparative framework. We tested the hypothesis that cavity-nesting generates more robust territorial aggression, in comparison to close relatives with less restrictive nesting strategies. Our focal species were two obligate secondary cavity-nesting species and two related species with more flexible nesting strategies in the same avian family: tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) vs. barn swallow (Hirundo rustica); Eastern bluebird (Sialia sialis) vs. American robin (Turdus migratorius). We assayed conspecific territorial aggression, and found that cavity-nesting species physically attacked a simulated intruder more often than their close relatives. This pattern held for both females and males. Because territorial aggression is often associated with elevated testosterone, we also hypothesized that cavity-nesting species would exhibit higher testosterone levels in circulation. However, cavity-nesting species did not have higher testosterone in circulation for either sex, despite some correlative evidence that testosterone is associated with higher rates of physical attack in female tree swallows. Our focus on a competitive context that is relevant to both sexes - competition over essential breeding resources - provides a useful comparative framework for co-consideration of proximate and ultimate drivers of reproductive competition in females and males.",

    "abstract": "Glycoside hydrolases (GH) are attractive tools for multiple biotechnological applications. In conjunction with their hydrolytic function, GH can perform transglycosylation reaction under specific conditions. In nature, oligosaccharides synthesis is performed by glycosyltransferase (GT). However, the industrial utilization of GT is limited by their instability in solution. A key difference between GT and GH is the flexibility of their binding sites architecture. In this report, we used the xylanase from Bacillus circulans (BCX) to study the interplay between active site flexibility and the transglycosylation reaction. Residues of the BCX thumb were substituted to increase the flexibility of the enzyme binding site. Replacement of the highly conserved residue P116 with glycine shifted the balance of the BCX enzymatic reaction toward transglycosylation. The effects of this point mutation on the structure and dynamics of BCX were investigated by NMR spectroscopy. The P116G mutation induces subtle changes in the configuration of the thumb and enhances the millisecond dynamics of the active site. Based on our findings, we propose the remodeling of the GH enzymes glycon site flexibility as a strategy to improve the transglycosylation efficiency of these biotechnologically important catalysts.",

    "abstract": "ABC-transporters transport a wealth of molecules across membranes and consist of transmembrane and cytosolic domains. Their activity cycle involves a tightly regulated and concerted domain choreography. Regulation is driven by the cytosolic domains and function by the transmembrane domains. Folding of these polytopic multidomain proteins to their functional state is a challenge for cells, which is mitigated by co-translational and sequential events. We here reveal the first stages of co-translational domain folding and assembly of CFTR, the ABC-transporter defective in the most abundant rare inherited disease cystic fibrosis. We have combined biosynthetic radiolabeling with protease-susceptibility assays and domain-specific antibodies. The most N-terminal domain, TMD1 (transmembrane domain 1), folds both its hydrophobic and soluble helices during translation: the transmembrane helices pack tightly and the cytosolic N- and C-termini assemble with the first cytosolic helical loop ICL1, leaving only ICL2 exposed. This N-C-ICL1 assembly is strengthened by two independent events: i) assembly of ICL1 with the N-terminal subdomain of the next domain, cytosolic NBD1 (nucleotide-binding domain 1); and ii) in the presence of corrector drug VX-809, which rescues cell-surface expression of a range of disease-causing CFTR mutants. Both lead to increased shielding of the CFTR N-terminus, and their additivity implies different modes of action. Early assembly of NBD1 and TMD1 is essential for CFTR folding and positions both domains for the required assembly with TMD2. Altogether, we have gained insights into this first, nucleating, VX-809-enhanced domain-assembly event during and immediately after CFTR translation, involving structures conserved in type-I ABC exporters.",

    "abstract": "Cuprizone is a copper chelator that induces mitochondrial dysfunction in myelin-producing oligodendrocytes and hepatic cells. Inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation has been proposed as a potential mechanism, but the exact relationship between shape changes and metabolic alterations is not well-understood. Here we explore how mitochondrial shape influences oxidative phosphorylation rates by performing simultaneous imaging and respiration measurements within intact cells. We observed that MO3.13 cells exposed to cuprizone undergo an initial increase in respiration followed by mitochondrial dysfunction and genetic dysregulation within 8 hours. Oxygen consumption was measured within 30 minutes of treatment and found to be elevated. This increase was followed by swelling of mitochondria over the first 8 hours, but preceded cell death by 24 hours. A transcriptomic analysis of early changes in cellular gene expression identified alterations within the electron transport chain, stress response pathways, and mitochondrial dynamics compared to control cells. These results suggest that pathological mitochondrial swelling is associated with increased oxygen consumption rates leading to transcriptional changes in respiratory complexes and ultimately mitochondrial failure.",

    "abstract": "Trichoderma genus fungi present great potential for the production of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZYmes), including glycoside hydrolase (GH) family members. From a renewability perspective, CAZYmes can be biotechnologically exploited to convert plant biomass into free sugars for the production of advanced biofuels and other high-value chemicals. GH54 is an attractive enzyme family for biotechnological applications because many GH54 enzymes are bifunctional. Thus, GH54 enzymes are interesting targets in the search for new enzymes for use in industrial processes such as plant biomass conversion. Herein, a novel metal-dependent GH54 arabinofuranosidase (ThABF) from the cellulolytic fungus Trichoderma harzianum was identified and biochemically characterized. Initial in silico searches were performed to identify the GH54 sequence. Next, the gene was cloned and heterologously overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein was purified, and the enzymes biochemical and biophysical properties were assessed. The GH54 members show wide functional diversity and specifically remove plant cell decorations including arabinose and galactose, in the presence of a metallic cofactor. Plant cell wall decoration have a major impact on lignocellulosic substrate conversion into high-value chemicals. These results expand the known functional diversity within the GH54 family, showing the potential of a novel arabinofuranosidase for plant biomass degradation.",

    "abstract": "In addition to a conventional relaxed state, a fraction of myosins in the cardiac muscle exists in a newly-discovered low-energy consuming super-relaxed (SRX) state, which is kept as a reserve pool that may be engaged under sustained increased cardiac demand. The conventional and the super-relaxed states are widely assumed to correspond respectively to a structure where myosin heads are in an open configuration, free to interact with actin, and a closed configuration, inhibiting binding to actin. Disruption of the SRX population in different heart diseases, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, results in unwarranted muscle contraction, and stabilizing them using myosin inhibitors is budding as an attractive therapeutic strategy. Here we examine the structure-function relationships of two myosin ATPase inhibitors, mavacamten, and blebbistatin, and found that binding of mavacamten to myosin at a site different than blebbistatin populates myosin into the SRX state. Blebbistatin, and para-nitroblebbistatin, binding to a distal pocket to the myosin lever arm near the nucleotide-binding site, does not affect the usual myosin SRX state but instead appears to render myosin into a new, perhaps non-functional,  ultra-relaxed state. X-ray scattering-based rigid body modeling shows that both mavacamten and para-nitroblebbistatin induce novel conformations that diverge significantly from the hypothetical open and closed states and furthermore, mavacamten treatment causes a greater compaction than para-nitroblebbistatin. Taken together, we conclude that mavacamten and blebbistatin stabilize myosin in different structural states, and such states may give rise to different functional energy-sparing SRX states.",

    "abstract": "The spike (S)-protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE2 and requires proteolytic \"priming\" at PRRAR685{downarrow} into S1 and S2 (cleavage at S1/S2), and \"fusion-activation\" at a S2 site for viral entry. In vitro, Furin cleaved peptides mimicking the S1/S2 cleavage site more efficiently than at the putative S2, whereas TMPRSS2 inefficiently cleaved both sites. In HeLa cells Furin-like enzymes mainly cleaved at S1/S2 during intracellular protein trafficking, and S2 processing by Furin at KPSKR815{downarrow} was strongly enhanced by ACE2, but not for the optimized S2 KRRKR815{downarrow} mutant (S2), whereas individual/double KR815AA mutants were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. Pharmacological Furin-inhibitors (Boston Pharmaceuticals, BOS-inhibitors) effectively blocked endogenous S-protein processing in HeLa cells. Furthermore, we show using pseudotyped viruses that while entry by a \"pH-dependent\" endocytosis pathway in HEK293 cells did not require Furin processing at S1/S2, a \"pH-independent\" viral entry in lung-derived Calu-3 cells was sensitive to inhibitors of Furin (BOS) and TMPRSS2 (Camostat). Consistently, these inhibitors potently reduce infectious viral titer and cytopathic effects, an outcome enhanced when both compounds were combined. Quantitative analyses of cell-to-cell fusion and spike processing revealed the key importance of the Furin sites for syncytia formation. Our assays showed that TMPRSS2 enhances fusion and proteolysis at S2 in the absence of cleavage at S1/S2, an effect that is linked to ACE2 shedding by TMPRSS2. Overall, our results indicate that Furin and TMPRSS2 play synergistic roles in generating fusion-competent S-protein, and in promoting viral entry, supporting the combination of Furin and TMPRSS2 inhibitors as potent antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.\n\nIMPORTANCESARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent of COVID-19 that resulted in >5 million deaths. The spike protein (S) of the virus directs infection of the lungs and other tissues by binding the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. For effective infection, the S-protein is cleaved at two sites: S1/S2 and S2. Cleavage at S1/S2, induces a conformational change favoring the recognition of ACE2. The S2 cleavage is critical for cell-to-cell fusion and virus entry into host cells. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the dynamics of interaction between Furin and TMPRSS2 during SARS-CoV-2 entry and suggests that the combination of a non-toxic Furin inhibitor with a TMPRSS2 inhibitor could significantly reduce viral entry in lung cells, as evidenced by an average synergistic [~]95% reduction of viral infection. This represents a powerful novel antiviral approach to reduce viral spread in individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 or future related coronaviruses.",

    "abstract": "The arms race between bacteria and phages has led to the development of exquisite bacterial defense systems including a number of uncharacterized systems distinct from the well-known Restriction-Modification and CRISPR/Cas systems. Here, we report functional analyses of the GajA protein from the newly predicted Gabija system. The GajA protein is revealed as an endonuclease unique in that: 1. It may function as a restriction enzyme or a site-specific nicking enzyme, depending on the arrangement of the recognition sequences; 2. Its activity is strictly regulated by nucleotides concentration. NTP and dNTP at physiological concentrations can fully inhibited the robust DNA cleavage activity of GajA. Interestingly, the nucleotide inhibition is mediated by an ATPase-like domain, which usually hydrolyzes ATP to stimulate the DNA cleavage when associated with other nucleases. These features suggested the mechanism of the Gabija defense in which an endonuclease activity was suppressed at normal condition, while activated by the depletion of NTP and dNTP upon the replication and transcription by invaded phages. This work highlights a concise strategy to utilize a single protein for phage resistance via nucleotide regulatory.",

    "abstract": "Super-resolution ultrasound (SRUS) imaging technique has overcome the diffraction limit of conventional ultrasound imaging, resulting in an improved spatial resolution while preserving imaging depth. Typical SRUS images are reconstructed by localizing ultrasound microbubbles (MBs) injected in a vessel using normalized 2-dimensional cross-correlation (2DCC) between MBs signals and the point spread function of the system. However, current techniques require isolated MBs in a confined area due to inaccurate localization of densely populated MBs. To overcome this limitation, we developed the {ell}1-homotopy based compressed sensing (L1H-CS) based SRUS imaging technique which localizes densely populated MBs to visualize microvasculature in vivo. To evaluate the performance of L1H-CS, we compared the performance of 2DCC, interior-point method based compressed sensing (CVX-CS), and L1H-CS algorithms. Localization efficiency was compared using axially and laterally aligned point targets (PTs) with known distances and randomly distributed PTs generated by simulation. We developed post-processing techniques including clutter reduction, noise equalization, motion compensation, and spatiotemporal noise filtering for in vivo imaging. We then validated the capabilities of L1H-CS based SRUS imaging technique with high-density MBs in a mouse tumor model, kidney, and zebrafish dorsal trunk, and brain. Compared to 2DCC, and CVX-CS algorithm, L1H-CS algorithm, considerable improvement in SRUS image quality and data acquisition time was achieved. These results demonstrate that the L1H-CS based SRUS imaging technique has the potential to examine the microvasculature with reduced acquisition and reconstruction time of SRUS image with enhanced image quality, which may be necessary to translate it into the clinics.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EV) are a promising therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine. These particles were shown to accelerate wound healing, through delivery of regenerative mediators, such as microRNAs. Herein we describe an optimized and up-scalable process for the isolation of EV smaller than 200 nm (sEV), secreted by umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells (UCB-MNC) under ischemic conditions and propose quality control thresholds for the isolated vesicles, based on the thorough characterization of their protein, lipid and RNA content.\n\nUltrafiltration and size exclusion chromatography (UF/SEC) optimized methodology proved superior to traditional ultracentrifugation (UC), regarding production time, standardization, scalability, and vesicle yield. Using UF/SEC, we were able to recover approximately 400 times more sEV per mL of media than with UC, and up-scaling this process further increases EV yield by about 3-fold. UF/SEC-isolated sEV display many of the sEV/exosomes classical markers and are enriched in molecules with anti-inflammatory and regenerative capacity, such as hemopexin and miR-150. Accordingly, treatment with sEV promotes angiogenesis and extracellular matrix remodeling, in vitro. In vivo, UCB-MNC-sEV significantly accelerate skin regeneration in a mouse model of delayed wound healing.\n\nThe proposed isolation protocol constitutes a significant improvement compared to UC, the gold-standard in the field. Isolated sEV maintain their regenerative properties, whereas downstream contaminants are minimized. The use of UF/SEC allows for the standardization and up-scalability required for mass production of sEV to be used in a clinical setting.",

    "abstract": "Delivery of exogenous mRNA using lipid nanoparticles (LNP) is a promising strategy for therapeutics. However, a bottleneck remains the poor understanding of the parameters that correlate with endosomal escape vs. cytotoxicity. To address this problem, we compared the endosomal distribution of six LNP-mRNA formulations of diverse chemical composition and efficacy, similar to those employed in mRNA-based vaccines, in primary human adipocytes, fibroblasts and HeLa cells. Surprisingly, we found that total uptake is not a sufficient predictor of delivery and different LNP vary considerably in endosomal distributions. Prolonged uptake impaired endosomal acidification, a sign of cytotoxicity, and caused mRNA to accumulate in compartments defective in cargo transport and unproductive for delivery. In contrast, early endocytic/recycling compartments have the highest probability for mRNA escape. By super-resolution microscopy we could resolve single LNP-mRNA within sub-endosomal compartments and capture events of mRNA escape from endosomal recycling tubules. Our results change the view of the mechanisms of endosomal escape and define quantitative parameters to guide the development of mRNA formulations towards higher efficacy and lower cytotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "MotivationBladder cancer cells acquire persistent infection associated with oncolytic Newcastle disease virus (NDV) in which its molecular events are still unclear. This poses a potential problem for oncolytic virus application for cancer therapy. To unravel the molecular mechanism underlying the development of NDV persistent infection in bladder cancer, we used mRNA expression profile of the persistently infected bladder cancer cells to construct PPI network.\n\nResultsBased on path and module exploring in the PPI network, the bridges were found mainly from pathways of p53 signalling, ECM-receptor interaction, and TGF-beta signalling by the upregulated mRNAs, to the antigen processing and presentation, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, completement and coagulation cascades by the downregulated mRNAs in NDV persistent TCCSUPPi cells. In persistent EJ28Pi cells comparatively, connections were identified mainly from pathways of renal carcinoma, viral carcinogenesis, Ras signalling and cell cycle by the upregulated mRNAs, to the Wnt signalling, HTLV-I infection and pathways in cancer by the downregulated mRNAs. This connection was mainly dependent on of RPL8- HSPA1A/HSPA4 in TCCSUPPi cells and EP300, PTPN11, RAC1 - TP53, SP1, CCND1 and XPO1 in EJ28Pi cells. Oncomine validation showed that the top hub genes identified in the network that includes RPL8, THBS1, F2 from TCCSUPPi and TP53 and RAC1 from EJ28Pi are involved in the development and progression of bladder cancer. Protein-drug interaction network, have identified several drugs targets that could be used to disconnect the linkages between modules and prevent bladder cancer cells from acquiring NDV persistent infection. This is the first time reporting the PPI network analysis of differentially expressed mRNAs of the NDV persistently infected bladder cancer cell lines which provide an insight into screening drugs that could be used together with NDV to manage bladder cancer resistance to therapy and progression.",

    "abstract": "The circadian clock modulates key physiological processes in many organisms. This widespread role of circadian rhythms is typically characterized at the molecular level by profiling the transcriptome at multiple time points. Subsequent analysis identifies transcripts with altered rhythms between control and perturbed conditions, i.e., are differentially rhythmic (DiffR). Commonly, Venn Diagram analysis (VDA) compares lists of rhythmic transcripts to catalog transcripts with rhythms in both conditions or have gained or lost rhythms. However, unavoidable errors in the rhythmicity detection propagate to the final DiffR classification resulting in overestimated DiffR. We show using artificial experiments constructed from biological data that VDA indeed produces excessive false DiffR hits both in the presence and absence of true DiffR transcripts. We present a hypothesis testing and a model selection approaches in an R-package compareRhythms that instead compare circadian amplitude and phase of transcripts between the two conditions. These methods identify transcripts with  gain,  loss,  change or have the  same rhythms; the third category is missed by VDA. We reanalyzed three studies on the interplay between metabolism and the clock in the mouse liver that used VDA. We found not only fewer DiffR transcripts than originally reported, but VDA overlooked many relevant DiffR transcripts. Our analyses confirmed some and contradicted other conclusions in the original studies and also generated novel hypotheses. Our insights also generalize easily to studies using other -omics technologies. We trust that avoiding Venn Diagrams and using our R-package will contribute to improved reproducibility in chronobiology.",

    "abstract": "In diploid species, many multi-parental populations have been developed to increase genetic diversity and quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping resolution. In these populations, haplotype reconstruction has been used as a standard practice to increase QTL detection power in comparison with the marker-based association analysis. To realize similar benefits in tetraploid species (and eventually higher ploidy levels), a statistical framework for haplotype reconstruction has been developed and implemented in the software PolyOrigin for connected tetraploid F1 populations with shared parents. Haplotype reconstruction proceeds in two steps: first, parental genotypes are phased based on multi-locus linkage analysis; second, genotype probabilities for the parental alleles are inferred in the progeny. PolyOrigin can utilize genetic marker data from single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays or from sequence-based genotyping; in the latter case, bi-allelic read counts can be used (and are preferred) as input data to minimize the influence of genotype call errors at low depth. To account for errors in the input map, PolyOrigin includes functionality for filtering markers, inferring inter-marker distances, and refining local marker ordering. Simulation studies were used to investigate the effect of several variables on the accuracy of haplotype reconstruction, including the mating design, the number of parents, population size, and sequencing depth. PolyOrigin was further evaluated using an autotetraploid potato dataset with a 3x3 half-diallel mating design. In conclusion, PolyOrigin opens up exciting new possibilities for haplotype analysis in tetraploid breeding populations.",

    "abstract": "Desensitization is a common feature of ligand-gated ion channels although the molecular cause varies widely between channel types. Mutations that substantially reduce or abolish desensitization have been described for many ligand-gated ion channels including glutamate, GABA, glycine and nicotinic receptors but not for acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) until recently. Mutating Gln276 to a glycine in human ASIC1a was reported to mostly abolish desensitization at both the macroscopic and single channel levels, potentially providing a valuable tool for subsequent studies. However, we find that in both human and chicken ASIC1 the effect of Q276G is modest. In chicken ASIC1, the equivalent Q277G slightly reduces desensitization when using pH 6.5 as a stimulus but desensitizes essentially like wild type when using more acidic pH values. In addition, steady-state desensitization is intact, albeit right-shifted, and recovery from desensitization is accelerated. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the Gln277 side chain participates in a hydrogen bond network that might stabilize the desensitized conformation. Consistent with this, destabilizing this network with the Q277N or Q277L mutations largely mimics the Q277G phenotype. In human ASIC1a, Q276G does not substantially reduce desensitization but surprisingly slows entry to and exit from the desensitized state, thus requiring longer agonist applications to reach equilibrium. Our data reveal that while the Q/G mutation does not substantially impair desensitization as previously reported, it does point to unexpected differences between chicken and human ASICs and the need for careful scrutiny before using this mutation in future studies.",

    "abstract": "The ATP-binding cassette transporter GlnPQ is an essential uptake system that transports glutamine, glutamic acid, and asparagine in Gram-positive bacteria. It features two extracytoplasmic substrate-binding domains (SBDs) that are linked in tandem to the transmembrane domain of the transporter. The two SBDs differ in their ligand specificities, binding affinities and their distance to the transmembrane domain. Here, we elucidate the effects of the tandem arrangement of the domains on the biochemical, biophysical and structural properties of the protein. For this, we determined the crystal structure of the ligand-free tandem SBD1-2 protein from L. lactis in the absence of the transporter and compared the tandem to the isolated SBDs. We also used isothermal titration calorimetry to determine the ligand-binding affinity of the SBDs and single-molecule Forster-resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to relate ligand binding to conformational changes in each of the domains of the tandem. We show that substrate binding and conformational changes are not notably affected by the presence of the adjoining domain in the wild-type protein, and changes only occur when the linker between the domains is shortened. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we combine smFRET with protein-induced fluorescence enhancement and show that a decrease in SBD linker length is observed as a linear increase in donor-brightness for SBD2 while we can still monitor the conformational states (open/closed) of SBD1. These results demonstrate the feasibility of PIFE-FRET to monitor protein-protein interactions and conformational states simultaneously.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIResolved crystal structure of tandem SBD1-2 of GlnPQ from Lactococcus lactis\nC_LIO_LIConformational states and ligand binding affinities of individual domains SBD1 and SBD2 are similar to tandem SBD1-2\nC_LIO_LINo cooperative effects are seen for different ligands for SBDs in the tandem\nC_LIO_LIProof of concept experiments show that PIFE-FRET can monitor SBD conformations and protein-protein interaction simultaneously\nC_LI\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=142 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/423572v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (87K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fa36f7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2e973forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cbae51org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2185cc_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Spectroscopy experiments are crucial to study membrane proteins for which traditional structure determination methods still prove challenging. Double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy experiments provide protein residue-pair distance distributions that are indicative of their conformational heterogeneity. Atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are another tool that have proved vital to study the structural dynamics of membrane proteins such as to identify inward-open, occluded, and outward-open conformations of transporter membrane proteins, among other partially open or closed states of the protein. Yet, studies have reported that there is no direct consensus between distributional data from DEER experiments and MD simulations, which has challenged validation of structures obtained from long-timescale simulations and using simulations to design experiments. Current coping strategies for comparisons rely on heuristics, such as mapping nearest matching peaks between two ensembles or biased simulations. Here we examine the differences in residue-pair distance distributions arising due to choice of membrane around the protein and covalent modification of a pair of residues to nitroxide spin labels in DEER experiments. Through comparing MD simulations of two proteins, PepTSo and LeuT - both of which have been characterized using DEER experiments previously - we show that the proteins dynamics are similar despite the choice of the detergent micelle as a membrane mimetic in DEER experiments. On the other hand, covalently modified residues show slight local differences in their dynamics and a huge divergence when the spin labels anointed oxygen atom pair distances are measured rather than protein backbone distances. Given the computational expense associated with pairwise MTSSL labeled MD simulations, we examine the use of biased simulations to explore the conformational dynamics of the spin labels only to reveal that such simulations alter the underlying protein dynamics. Our study identifies the main cause for the mismatch between DEER experiments and MD simulations and will accelerate developing potential mitigation strategies to improve simulation observables match with DEER spectroscopy experiments.",

In particular, upward curvature in log ku(f) as a function of f implies that the underlying energy landscape must be multidimensional with the possibility that unfolding ensues by parallel pathways. Here, simulations using the SOP-SC model of a wild type {beta}-sandwich protein and several mutants, with immunoglobulin folds, show upward curvature in the unfolding kinetics. There are substantial changes in the structures of the transition state ensembles as force is increased, signaling a switch in the unfolding pathways.

Using NMR, we determine a high-resolution structure of the Bax core region that forms a dimer with the nonpolar surface covering the lipid bilayer edge and the polar surface exposed to water. The dimer tilts from the bilayer normal, not only maximizing nonpolar interactions with lipid tails but creating polar interactions between charged residues and lipid heads.

    "abstract": "Na+/Ca2+ exchangers (NCX) are secondary active transporters that couple the translocation of Na+ with the transport of Ca2+ in the opposite direction. The exchanger is an essential Ca2+ extrusion mechanism in excitable cells. It consists of a transmembrane domain and a large intracellular loop that contains two Ca2+-binding domains, CBD1 and CBD2. The two CBDs are adjacent to each other and form a two-domain Ca2+-sensor called CBD12. Binding of intracellular Ca2+ to CBD12 activates the NCX but inhibits the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger of Drosophila, CALX. NMR spectroscopy and SAXS studies showed that CALX and NCX CBD12 constructs display significant inter-domain flexibility in the Apo state, but assume rigid inter-domain arrangements in the Ca2+-bound state. However, detailed structure information on CBD12 in the Apo state is missing. Structural characterization of proteins formed by two or more domains connected by flexible linkers is notoriously challenging and requires the combination of orthogonal information from multiple sources. As an attempt to characterize the conformational ensemble of CALX-CBD12 in the Apo state, we applied molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, NMR (1H-15N RDCs) and Small-Angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS) data in a combined modelling strategy that generated atomistic information on the most representative conformations. This joint approach demonstrated that CALX-CBD12 preferentially samples closed conformations, while the wide-open inter-domain arrangement characteristic of the Ca2+-bound state is less frequently sampled. These results are consistent with the view that Ca2+ binding shifts the CBD12 conformational ensemble towards extended conformers, which could be a key step in the Na+/Ca2+ exchangers allosteric regulation mechanism. The present strategy, combining MD with NMR and SAXS, provides a powerful approach to select representative structures from ensembles of conformations, which could be applied to other flexible multi-domain systems.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEThe conformational ensemble of CALX-CBD12, the main Ca2+-sensor of Drosophilas Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, was characterized by a combination of MD simulations with SAXS and NMR data using the EOM approach. This analysis showed that this two-domain construct experiences opening-closing motions, providing molecular information about CALX-CBD12 in the Apo state. Ca2+-binding shifts the conformational ensemble towards extended conformers. These findings are consistent with a model according to which Ca2+ modulation of CBD12 plasticity is a key step in the Ca2+-regulation mechanism of the full-length exchanger.",

    "abstract": "RNA viruses induce formation of subcellular organelles that provide microenvironments conducive to their replication. Here we show that replication factories of rotaviruses represent protein-RNA condensates that are formed via liquid-liquid phase separation. We demonstrate that rotavirus proteins NSP5 and NSP2 undergo phase separation in vitro and form RNA-rich condensates in vivo that can be reversibly dissolved by aliphatic diols. During infection, these RNA-protein condensates became less dynamic and impervious to aliphatic diols, indicating a transition from a liquid to solid state. Some aspects of assembly of rotavirus replication factories mirror the formation of cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein granules, while the selective enrichment of viral transcripts appears to be a unique feature of these condensates. Such complex RNA-protein condensates that underlie replication of RNA viruses represent an attractive target for developing novel therapeutic approaches.",

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy success in colorectal cancer (CRC) is mainly limited to patients whose tumours exhibit high microsatellite instability (MSI). However, there is variability in treatment outcomes within this group, which is in part driven by the frequency and characteristics of tumour infiltrating immune cells. Indeed, the presence of specific infiltrating immune cell subsets has been shown to correlate with immunotherapy responses and is in many cases prognostic of treatment outcome. Tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) can undergo distinct differentiation programs, acquiring features of tissue-residency or exhaustion, a process during which T cells upregulate inhibitory receptors such as PD-1 and loose functionality. While residency and exhaustion programs of CD8 T cells are relatively well-studied, these programs have only recently been appreciated in CD4 T cells and remain largely unknown in tumour-infiltrating natural killer (NK) cells. In this study, we use single cell RNA-seq data to identify signatures of residency and exhaustion in CRC infiltrating lymphocytes, including CD8, CD4 and NK cells. We then test these signatures in independent single cell data from tumour and normal tissue infiltrating immune cells. Further, we use versions of these signatures designed for bulk RNA-seq data to explore tumour intrinsic mutations associated with residency and exhaustion from TCGA data. Finally, using two independent transcriptomic data sets from patients with colon adenocarcinoma, we show that combinations of these signatures, in particular combinations of NK activity signatures, together with tumour-associated signatures, such as TGF-{beta} signalling, are associated with distinct survival outcomes in colorectal cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "Plant innate immunity is activated upon perception of invasion pattern molecules by plant cell-surface immune receptors. Several bacteria of the genera Pseudomonas and Burkholderia produce rhamnolipids (RLs) from L- rhamnose and (R)-3-hydroxyalkanoate precursors (HAAs). RL and HAA secretion is required to modulate bacterial surface motility, biofilm development, and thus successful colonization of hosts. Here, we show that the lipidic secretome from the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa mostly comprising RLs and HAAs stimulates Arabidopsis immunity. We demonstrate that HAAs are sensed by the bulb-type lectin receptor kinase LIPOOLIGOSACCHARIDE-SPECIFIC REDUCED ELICITATION/S-DOMAIN-1-29 (LORE/SD1-29) that also mediates medium-chain 3-hydroxy fatty acid (mc-3-OH-FA) perception in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. HAA sensing induces canonical immune signaling and local resistance to plant pathogenic Pseudomonas infection. By contrast, RLs trigger an atypical immune response and resistance to Pseudomonas infection independent of LORE. Thus, the glycosyl moieties of RLs, albeit abolishing sensing by LORE, do not impair their ability to trigger plant defense. In addition, our results show that RL-triggered immune response is affected by the sphingolipid composition of the plasma membrane. In conclusion, RLs and their precursors released by bacteria can both be perceived by plants but through distinct mechanisms.\n\nSignificanceActivation of plant innate immunity relies on the perception of microorganisms through self and nonself elicitors. Rhamnolipids and their precursor HAAs are exoproducts produced by beneficial and pathogenic bacteria. They are involved in bacterial surface dissemination and biofilm development. As these compounds are released in the extracellular milieu, they have the potential to be perceived by the plant immune system. Our work shows that both compounds independently activate plant immunity. We demonstrate that HAAs are perceived by the receptor protein kinase LORE. By contrast, rhamnolipids are not senses by LORE but activate a non-canonical immune response affected by the sphingolipid composition of the plant plasma membrane. Thus, plants are able to sense bacterial molecules as well as their direct precursors to trigger a distinct immune response.",

    "abstract": "Soil salinity is an increasing worldwide problem for agriculture, affecting plant growth and yield. To understand the molecular mechanisms activated in response to salt in plants, we investigated the Catharanthus roseus Receptor like Kinase 1 Like (CrRLK1L) family, which contains well described sensors previously shown to be involved in maintaining and sensing the structural integrity of the cell walls. We found that herk1the1-4 double mutants, lacking the function of the Arabidopsis thaliana Receptor like Kinase HERKULES1 combined with a gain-of-function allele of THESEUS1, phenocopied the phenotypes previously reported in plants lacking FERONIA (FER) function. We report that both fer-4 and herk1the1-4 mutants respond strongly to salt application, resulting in a more intense activation of early and late stress responses. We also show that salt triggers de-methyl esterification of loosely bound pectins, responsible for the activation of several salt response signaling pathways. Addition of calcium chloride or chemically inhibiting pectin methyl esterase (PME) activity reduced activation of the early signaling protein Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase 6 (MPK6) as well as amplitude of salt-induced marker gene induction. MPK6 is required for the full induction of the salt-induced gene expression markers we tested. The sodium specific root halotropism response on the other hand, appears independent of MPK6 or calcium application, and is only mildly influenced by the cell wall sensors FER/HERK1/THE1-4 or alteration of PME activity. We hypothesize a model where salt-triggered modification of pectin requires the functionality of FER alone or the HERK1/THE1 combination to attenuate salt responses. Collectively, our results show the complexity of salt stress responses and salt sensing mechanisms and their connection to cell wall modifications, responsible for several salt response pathways and ultimately plant resilience to salinity.",

Here we analyze circuits which implement dosage control by controlling levels of a global signal in a microbial population in face of varying cell density, growth rate, and environmental dilution. We utilize the Lux quorum sensing system to implement dosage control circuits, and we analyze the dynamics of circuits using both simplified analytical analysis and in silico simulations. We demonstrate that strong negative feedback through inhibiting LuxI synthase expression along with AiiA degradase activity results in circuits with fast response times and robustness to cell density and dilution rate. We find that degradase activity yields robustness to variations in population density for large population sizes, while negative feedback to synthase production decreases sensitivity to dilution rates.",

    "abstract": "Globally increasing levels of artificial light at night (ALAN) are associated with shifts in circadian rhythms of behaviour in many wild species. However, it is still unclear whether changes in behavioural timing are underlined by parallel shifts in the molecular clock, and whether such internal shifts may differ between different tissues and physiological pathways, which could highlight circadian disruption. We tackled these questions in a comprehensive study that integrated behavioural, gene expression and metabolomic analyses. We exposed captive male great tits (Parus major) to three ALAN intensities or to dark nights, recorded their activity rhythms and obtained mid-day and midnight samples of brain, liver, spleen and blood. ALAN advanced wake-up time, and this shift was paralleled by an advance in the expression of the clock gene BMAL1 in all tissues, suggesting close links of brain and peripheral clock gene expression with activity rhythms. However, several metabolic and immune genes were desynchronised the shifted BMAL1 expression, suggesting circadian disruption of behaviour and physiology. This result was reinforced by untargeted metabolomic profiling, which showed that only 9.7% of the 755 analysed metabolites followed the behavioural shift. We suggest circadian as a key mediator of the health impacts of ALAN on wild animals.",
