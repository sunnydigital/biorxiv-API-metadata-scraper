    "abstract": "To efficiently process information, the brain shifts between encoding and retrieval states, prioritising bottom-up or top-down processing accordingly. Expectation violation before or during learning has been shown to trigger an adaptive encoding mechanism, resulting in better memory for unexpected events. Using fMRI we explored (1) whether this encoding mechanism is also triggered during retrieval, and if so, (2) what the temporal dynamics of its mnemonic consequences are. Male and female participants studied object images, then, with new objects, they learned a contingency between a cue and a semantic category. Rule-abiding (expected) and violating (unexpected) targets and similar foils were used at test. We found interactions between previous and current similar events expectation, such that when an expected event followed a similar but unexpected event, its performance was boosted, underpinned by activation in the hippocampus, midbrain, and occipital cortex. In contrast, a sequence of two unexpected similar events also triggered occipital engagement, however, this did not enhance memory performance. Taken together, our findings suggest that when the goal is to retrieve, encountering surprising events engages an encoding mechanism, supported by bottom-up processing, that may enhance memory for future related events.\n\nSignificance statementOptimising the balance between new learning and the retrieval of existing knowledge is an ongoing process, at the core of human cognition. Previous research into memory encoding suggests experiencing surprise leads to the prioritisation of the leaning of new memories, forming an adaptive encoding mechanism. We examined whether this mechanism is also engaged when the current goal is to retrieve information. Our results demonstrate that an expectation-driven shift towards an encoding state, supported by enhanced perceptual processing, is beneficial for the correct identification of subsequent expected similar events. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the temporal dynamics of the adaptive encoding of information into memory.",

    "abstract": "Trypanosomatids have a cytoskeleton arrangement that is simpler than what is found in most eukaryotic cells. However, it is precisely organized and constituted by stable microtubules. Such microtubules compose the mitotic spindle during mitosis, the basal body, the flagellar axoneme and the subpellicular microtubules, which are connected to each other and also to the plasma membrane forming a helical arrangement along the central axis of the parasite cell body. Subpellicular, mitotic and axonemal microtubules are extensively acetylated in Trypanosoma cruzi. Acetylation on lysine (K) 40 of -tubulin is conserved from lower eukaryotes to mammals and is associated with microtubule stability. It is also known that K40 acetylation occurs significantly on flagella, centrioles, cilia, basal body and the mitotic spindle in eukaryotes. Several tubulin posttranslational modifications, including acetylation of K40, have been catalogued in trypanosomatids, but the functional importance of these modifications for microtubule dynamics and parasite biology remains largely undefined. The primary tubulin acetyltransferase that delivers this modification was recently identified in several eukaryotes as Mec-17/ATAT, a Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase. Here, we report that T. cruzi ATAT acetylates -tubulin in vivo and is capable of auto-acetylation. TcATAT is located in the cytoskeleton and flagella of epimastigotes and colocalizes with acetylated -tubulin in these structures. We have expressed TcATAT with an HA tag using the inducible vector pTcINDEX-GW in T. cruzi. Over-expression of TcATAT causes increased levels of the acetylated isoform, induces morphological and ultrastructural defects, especially in the mitochondrion, and causes a halt in the cell cycle progression of epimastigotes, which is related to an impairment of the kinetoplast division. Finally, as a result of TcATAT over-expression we observed that parasites became more resistant to microtubule depolymerizing drugs. These results support the idea that -tubulin acetylation levels are finely regulated for the normal progression of T. cruzi cell cycle.",

    "abstract": "The differentiation of ICM cells into epiblast (EPI) and primitive endoderm (PE) is central in embryonic development. It is known that FGF4 signaling is important in this process, but it remains unclear how cells can be correctly partitioned. Here we model the NANOG-GATA6-FGF4 network, and test all 64 logical regulatory combinations for their ability to partition a group of cells. We found that nearly all the logic combinations allowed for correct partitioning, including a minimal network where self-activation of NANOG and GATA6 was inactivated. However such self-activation increased the robustness of the system. Furthermore, the model also captured the reported changes in cell proportions in response to FGF perturbations. This constrains the possible regulatory logic and predicts the presence of an \"OR\" gate in cell-cell communication. We repeatedly found that FGF4 coordinated the decision in two phases: A convergence and a bifurcation phase. First FGF4 negative feedback drives the cells to a balanced \"battle\" state where most cells have intermediate levels of both regulators, thus being double positive. Subsequent bifurcation happens at constant FGF4 level. Together our results suggest that the frequently observed state of multipotency during differentiation may be an emergent phenomenon resulting from inter-cellular negative feedbacks.",

    "abstract": "Telomeres are repetitive sequences located at the end of chromosomes in eukaryotes that protect against loss of important sequences during the cell replication process. Telomere length (TL) shortens with every round of cell division. When a telomere becomes too short, cells can no longer proliferate and this triggers the cell apoptosis process. Apart from cell replication, the length of telomeres can be affected by factors such as sex, genetics, and stress levels. Oxidative stress in particular can cause damage to telomeres and telomere maintenance processes, resulting in TL shortening. This phenomenon occurs in humans and many vertebrates, especially endothermic species. However, the ways in which various stress types affect the TL of invertebrate species remains ambiguous.\n\nHere, we examined the effects of development and oxidative stress on TL in the invertebrate pest moth, Helicoverpa armigera. In the former case, we extracted genomic DNA from three developmental stages (1-day old egg, 4th instar, and first-day emerged moths) and measured TL by qPCR. In the latter, we chronically exposed individuals to paraquat - an organic herbicide that induces oxidative stress - and then measured TL as per our development methodology. In addition, we examined TL in a subset of published whole genome short-read sequencing data of caterpillars and moths using the software, Computel.\n\nIn our experimental work, we found that TL in H. armigera was significantly longer at the early stages of development and shortens in later stages. However, oxidative stress does not appear to shorten TL in H. armigera following chronic exposure to paraquat. In our Computel analysis, we found that caterpillars had longer mean TL than moths but this difference was not significant due to the high variation among samples.\n\nCollectively, our research provides new data on TL in an underrepresented group, adding new insights into the progression of TL shortening with development and the effects of oxidative stress on TL, while also more generally highlighting the value of applying complementary approaches to TL measurement.",

    "abstract": "Although drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum typically evolves in regions of low transmission, resistance spreads readily following introduction to regions with a heavier disease burden. This suggests that the origin and the spread of resistance are governed by different processes, and that high transmission intensity specifically impedes the origin. Factors associated with high transmission, such as highly immune hosts and competition within genetically diverse infections, are associated with suppression of resistant lineages within hosts. However, interactions between these factors have rarely been investigated and the specific relationship between adaptive immunity and selection for resistance has not been explored. Here, we developed a multiscale, agent-based model of Plasmodium parasites, hosts, and vectors to examine how host and parasite dynamics shape the evolution of resistance in populations with different transmission intensities. We found that selection for antigenic novelty (\"immune selection\") and within-host competition both suppressed the evolution of resistance in high transmission settings. We show that high levels of population immunity increased the strength of immune selection relative to selection for resistance. As a result, immune selection delayed the evolution of resistance in high transmission populations by allowing novel, sensitive lineages to remain in circulation at the expense of common, resistant lineages. In contrast, in low transmission populations, we observed that common, resistant strains were able to sweep to high population prevalence without interference. Additionally, we found that the relationship between immune selection and resistance changed when resistance was widespread in the population. Once resistance was common enough to be found on many antigenic backgrounds, immune selection stably maintained resistance in the population because resistance was able to proliferate, even in untreated hosts, when it was linked to a novel epitope. The results of our simulations demonstrate that immune selection plays a major role in observed dynamics of resistance evolution.\n\nAuthor summaryDrug resistance in the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, presents an ongoing public health challenge, but aspects of its evolution are poorly understood. Although antimalarial resistance is common worldwide, it can typically be traced to just a handful of origins. Counterintuitively, although Sub Saharan Africa bears 90% of the global malaria burden, resistance typically originates in regions where transmission intensity is low. In high transmission regions, infections are genetically diverse, and hosts have significant standing adaptive immunity, both of which are known to suppress frequency of resistance within infections. However, interactions between immune-driven selection, transmission intensity, and resistance have not been investigated. Using a multiscale, agent-based model, we found that high transmission intensity slowed the evolution of resistance in two ways. First, it intensified competition, allowing sensitive lineages to suppress resistant lineages. Second, high population immunity selected for antigenic novelty, which interfered with selection for resistance. However, once resistance was at a high frequency, immune selection maintained it in the population at a high prevalence. Our findings provide a novel explanation for observations about the origin of resistance and demonstrate that adaptive immunity is a critical component of selection.",

    "abstract": "Cell sorting, whereby a heterogeneous cell mixture segregates and forms distinct homogeneous tissues, is one of the main collective cell behaviors at work during development. Although differences in interfacial energies are recognized to be a possible driving source for cell sorting, no clear consensus has emerged on the kinetic law of cell sorting driven by differential adhesion. Using a modified Cellular Potts Model algorithm that allows for efficient simulations while preserving the connectivity of cells, we numerically explore cell-sorting dynamics over unprecedentedly large scales in space and time. For a binary mixture of cells surrounded by a medium, increase of domain size follows a power-law with exponent n = 1/4 independently of the mixture ratio, revealing that the kinetics is dominated by the diffusion and coalescence of rounded domains. We compare these results with recent numerical and experimental studies on cell sorting, and discuss the importance of boundary conditions, space dimension, initial cluster geometry, and finite size effects on the observed scaling.\n\nAuthor summaryCell sorting describes the spontaneous segregation of identical cells in biological tissues. This phenomenon is observed during development or organ regeneration in a variety of biological systems. Minimization of the total surface energy of a tissue, in which adhesion strengh between homotypic and heterotypic cells are different, is one of the mechanisms that explain cell sorting. This mechanism is then similar to the one that drives demixing of two immiscible fluids. Because of the high sensibility of this process to finite-size and finite-time effects, no clear consensus has emerged on the scaling law of cell sorting driven by differential adhesion. Using an efficient numerical code, we were able to investigate this scaling law on very large binary mixtures of cells. We show that on long times, cell sorting obeys a universal power law, which is independent of the mixture ratio.",

    "abstract": "The plastochron, the time interval between the formation of two successive leaves, is an important determinant of plant architecture. We genetically and phenotypically investigated many-noded dwarf (mnd) mutants in barley. The mnd mutants exhibited a shortened plastochron and a decreased leaf blade length, and resembled previously reported plastochron1 (pla1), pla2, and pla3 mutants in rice. In addition, the maturation of mnd leaves was accelerated, similar to pla mutants in rice. Several barley mnd alleles were derived from three loci--MND1, MND4, and MND8. Although MND4 coincided with a cytochrome P450 family gene that is a homolog of rice PLA1, we clarified that MND1 and MND8 encode an N-acetyltransferase-like protein and a MATE transporter-family protein, which are respectively orthologs of rice GW6a and maize BIGE1 and unrelated to PLA2 or PLA3. Expression analyses of the three MND genes revealed that MND1 and MND4 were expressed in limited regions of the shoot apical meristem and leaf primordia, but MND8 did not exhibit a specific expression pattern around the shoot apex. In addition, the expression levels of the three genes were interdependent among the various mutant backgrounds. Genetic analyses using the double mutants mnd4mnd8 and mnd1mnd8 indicated that MND1 and MND4 regulate the plastochron independently of MND8, suggesting that the plastochron in barley is controlled by multiple genetic pathways involving MND1, MND4, and MND8. Correlation analysis between leaf number and leaf blade length indicated that both traits exhibited a strong negative association among different genetic backgrounds but not in the same genetic background. We propose that MNDs function in the regulation of the plastochron and leaf growth and revealed conserved and diverse aspects of plastochron regulation via comparative analysis of barley and rice.\n\nAuthor summaryThe number of leaves produced during a plants lifetime is major determinant of plant architecture and affects the efficiency of photosynthesis and crop productivity. The leaf number is dependent on the temporal pattern of leaf initiation at the shoot apical meristem, which is termed the plastochron. The genetic factors involved in plastochron regulation have been identified in several plant species. However, whether the functions of plastochron-related genes and their genetic pathways are universal or diversified among different plant species is unclear. In this study, we investigated many-noded dwarf (mnd) mutants in barley, which exhibited a shortened plastochron and a decreased leaf blade length. The mutant alleles used in this study were derived from three loci, MND4, MND1, and MND8, which encode a cytochrome P450 family protein, an N-acetyltransferase-like protein, and a MATE transporter-family protein, respectively. Phenotypic and expression analyses revealed that these three MND genes affect the leaf production rate and leaf maturation program, but their expression levels were interdependent. In addition, the plastochron and leaf growth are closely related but independently regulated. We also analyzed the expression patterns and knockout mutants of rice MND orthologs to clarify whether their biological functions are conserved in rice and barley. This study provides insight into the genetic mechanisms of plastochron control in grass species.",

Objectives of this study was to find the prevalence of corporal punishment in schools and the knowledge, perceptions and actions in the children.\n\nMethodsA community based cross sectional descriptive study done among school students from Jaffna district using a pretested questionnaire containing 40 questions. Multistage stratified proportionate cluster sampling was used to recruit the students. Scoring systems were used to determine the knowledge and perception of Corporal-punishment. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 20.\n\nResultsA total of 1130 students were recruited with mean age of 17.58{+/-}0.5y. A total of 687(60.7%) said they received some form of corporal punishment at least once during the school term. Physical punishment (64.5%) was common followed by psychological (27.1%). Teachers (54.8%) were the main group involved in corporal-punishment. Mean score for the knowledge was 11.11 and a good knowledge score was seen in 37.3% of the students. Participants with good knowledge favored law against it (p value<0.05), take legal action (P value<0.05) and supported complete prohibition of it (P value<0.05). Nearly 2% (n=22) had good perception and 40.8% (n=461) had a more positive perception. Majority (86.3%) preferred an alternative way of discipline and felt it was detrimental to the future (89.5%).\n\nConclusionCorporal-punishment was experienced by majority of the students in school and the students were aware that it was illegal and those with good knowledge were willing to take legal action.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is one of the most frequent cancers affecting women. Non-coding micro RNAs (miRNAs) seem to play an important role in the regulation of pathways involved in tumor occurrence and progression. Extending on the research in Haakensen et al., where significant miRNAs were selected as being associated with the progression from normal breast tissue to breast cancer, in this work we put forward 112 sets of miRNA combinations, each including at most 5 expressions with high accuracy in discriminating healthy breast tissue from breast carcinoma. Our results are based on a recently developed machine learning technique which, instead of selecting a single model (or combination of features), delivers a set of models with equivalent predictive capabilities that allow to interpret and visualize the interaction of these features. These results shed new light on the biological action of the selected miRNAs which can behave in different ways according to the miRNA network with which they interact.\n\nIndeed, these revealed connections may contribute to explain why, in some cases, different studies attribute opposite functions to the same miRNA. It is therefore possible to understand how the role of a genomic variable may change when considered in interaction with other sets of variables, as opposed to only considering its effect when it is evaluated within a unique combination of features. The approach proposed in this work provides a statistical basis for the notion of chameleon miRNAs and is inspired by the emerging field of systems biology.\n\nAuthor SummaryO_LIThe notion of a single predictive genomic (statistical) model is replaced by that of a set of models that can be considered as exchangeable due to their indistinguishable (optimal) predictive abilities;\nC_LIO_LIOur results indicate that the role of miRNAs cannot be interpreted independently from the combination of features with which they interact and can therefore vary considerably when considered in a network of different combinations.

    "abstract": "With high drug attrition, interaction network methods are increasingly attractive as quick and inexpensive methods for prediction of drug safety and efficacy effects when a drug pathway is unknown. However, these methods suffer from high false positive rates for selecting drug phenotypic effects, their performance is often no better than random (AUROC ~0.5), and this limits the use of network methods in regulatory and industrial decision making. In contrast to many network engineering approaches that apply mathematical thresholds to discover phenotype associations, we hypothesized that interaction networks associated with true positive drug phenotypes are context specific. We tested this hypothesis on 16 designated medical event (DMEs) phenotypes which are a subset of adverse events that are of upmost concern to FDA review using a novel data set extracted from drug labels. We demonstrated that context-specific interactions (CSIs) distinguished true from false positive DMEs with an 50% improvement over non-context-specific approaches (AUROC 0.77 compared to 0.51). By reducing false positives, CSI analysis has the potential to advance network techniques to influence decision making in regulatory and industry settings.\n\nAuthor summaryDrugs bind proteins that interact with multiple downstream proteins and these protein networks are responsible for drug efficacy and safety. Protein interaction network methods predict drug effects aggregating information about proteins around drug-binding protein targets. However, many frameworks exist for identifying proteins relevant to a drugs effect. We consider three frameworks for selecting these proteins and show increased performance from a context-specific approach on selecting proteins relevant to severe drug side effects. The context-specific approach leverages the idea that the proteins responsible for a drug side effect are specific to each side-effect. By discovering the relevant proteins, we can better understand downstream effects of drugs and better anticipate drug side effects for new drugs in development. Further, we focus on designated medical events, a subset of the most severe drug side-effects that are high priority for regulatory review.",

    "abstract": "The synchronization of different{gamma} -rhythms arising in different brain areas has been impli-cated in various cognitive functions. Here, we focus on the effect of the ubiquitous neuronal heterogeneity on the synchronization of PING (pyramidal-interneuronal network gamma) and ING (interneuronal network gamma) rhythms. The synchronization properties of rhythms depends on the response of their collective phase to external input. We therefore determined the macroscopic phase-response curve for finite-amplitude perturbations (fmPRC), using numerical simulation of all-to-all coupled networks of integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons exhibiting either PING or ING rhythms. We show that the intrinsic neuronal heterogeneity can qualitatively modify the fmPRC. While the phase-response curve for the individual IF-neurons is strictly positive (type I), the fmPRC can be biphasic and exhibit both signs (type II). Thus, for PING rhythms, an external excitation to the excitatory cells can, in fact, delay the collective oscillation of the network, even though the same excitation would lead to an advance when applied to uncoupled neurons. This paradoxical delay arises when the external excitation modifies the internal dynamics of the network by causing additional spikes of inhibitory neurons, whose delaying within-network inhibition outweighs the immediate advance caused by the external excitation. These results explain how intrinsic heterogeneity allows the PING rhythm to become synchronized with a periodic forcing or another PING rhythm for a wider range in the mismatch of their frequencies. We demonstrate a similar mechanism for the synchronization of ING rhythms. Our results identify a potential function of neuronal heterogeneity in the synchronization of coupled{gamma} -rhythms, which may play a role in neural information transfer via communication through coherence.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe interaction of a large number of oscillating units can lead to the emergence of a collective, macroscopic oscillation in which many units oscillate in near-unison or near-synchrony. This has been exploited technologically, e.g., to combine many coherently interacting, individual lasers to form a single powerful laser. Collective oscillations are also important in biology. For instance, the circadian rhythm of animals is controlled by the near-synchronous dynamics of a large number of individually oscillating cells. In animals and humans brain rhythms reflect the coherent dynamics of a large number of neurons and are surmised to play an important role in the communication between different brain areas. To be functionally relevant, these rhythms have to respond to external inputs and have to be able to synchronize with each other. We show that the ubiquitous heterogeneity in the properties of the individual neurons in a network can contribute to that ability. It can allow the external inputs to modify the internal network dynamics such that the network can follow these inputs over a wider range of frequencies. Paradoxically, while an external perturbation may delay individual neurons, their ensuing within-network interaction can overcompensate this delay, leading to an overall advance of the rhythm.",

    "abstract": "An important question in neuroscience is whether or not we can interpret spontaneous variations in the pattern of correlation between brain areas, which we refer to as functional connectivity or FC, as an index of dynamic neuronal communication in fMRI. That is, can we measure time-varying FC reliably? And, if so, can FC reflect information transfer between brain regions at relatively fast-time scales? Answering these questions in practice requires dealing with the statistical challenge of having high-dimensional data and a comparatively lower number of time points or volumes. A common strategy is to use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data, and then apply some model, such as the hidden Markov model (HMM) or a Bayesian mixture of distributions, to find a set of distinct FC patterns or states. The distinct spatial properties of these FC states together with the time-resolved switching between them offer a flexible description of time-varying FC. In this work, we show that in this context PCA can suffer from systematic biases and loss of sensitivity for the purposes of finding time-varying FC. To get around these issues, we propose a novel variety of the HMM, the HMM-PCA, where the states are themselves PCA decompositions. Since PCA is based on the data covariance, the state-specific PCA decompositions reflect distinct patterns of FC. We show, theoretically and empirically, that fusing dimensionality reduction and time-varying FC estimation in one single step can avoid these problems and outperform alternative approaches, eventually facilitating the quantification of transient communication in the brain.\n\nAuthor summaryWe show that PCA, although widely used in practice, can introduce important biases and loss of sensitivity in the estimation of time-varying functional connectivity on high-dimensional fMRI data. We discuss these limitations and propose a new method that, by performing dimensionality reduction and time-varying functional connectivity estimation in one single step, can effectively overcome these limitations.",

    "abstract": "What is the relationship between anatomical connection strength and rhythmic synchronization? Simultaneous recordings of 15 cortical areas in two macaque monkeys show that interareal networks are functionally organized in spatially distinct modules with specific synchronization frequencies, i.e. frequency-specific functional connectomes. We relate the functional interactions between 91 area pairs to their anatomical connection strength defined in a separate cohort of twenty six subjects. This reveals that anatomical connection strength predicts rhythmic synchronization and vice-versa, in a manner that is specific for frequency bands and for the feedforward versus feedback direction, even if interareal distances are taken into account. These results further our understanding of structure-function relationships in large-scale networks covering different modality-specific brain regions and provide strong constraints on mechanistic models of brain function. Because this approach can be adapted to non-invasive techniques, it promises to open new perspectives on the functional organization of the human brain.",

    "abstract": "Ca2+ imaging is a widely used microscopy technique to simultaneously study cellular activity in multiple cells. The desired information consists of cell-specific time series of pixel intensity values, in which the fluorescence intensity represents cellular activity. For static scenes, cellular signal extraction is straightforward, however multiple analysis challenges are present in recordings of contractile tissues, like those of the enteric nervous system (ENS). This layer of critical neurons, embedded within the muscle layers of the gut wall, shows optical overlap between neighboring neurons, intensity changes due to cell activity, and constant movement. These challenges reduce the applicability of classical segmentation techniques and traditional stack alignment and regions-of-interest (ROIs) selection workflows. Therefore, a signal extraction method capable of dealing with moving cells and is insensitive to large intensity changes in consecutive frames is needed.\n\nHere we propose a b-spline active contour method to delineate and track neuronal cell bodies based on local and global energy terms. We develop both a single as well as a double-contour approach. The latter takes advantage of the appearance of GCaMP expressing cells, and tracks the nucleus boundaries together with the cytoplasmic contour, providing a stable delineation of neighboring, overlapping cells despite movement and intensity changes. The tracked contours can also serve as landmarks to relocate additional and manually-selected ROIs. This improves the total yield of efficacious cell tracking and allows signal extraction from other cell compartments like neuronal processes. Compared to manual delineation and other segmentation methods, the proposed method can track cells during large tissue deformations and high-intensity changes such as during neuronal firing events, while preserving the shape of the extracted Ca2+ signal. The analysis package represents a significant improvement to available Ca2+ imaging analysis workflows for ENS recordings and other systems where movement challenges traditional Ca2+ signal extraction workflows.",

    "abstract": "In everyday conversation, we usually process the talkers face as well as the sound of their voice. Access to visual speech information is particularly useful when the auditory signal is degraded. Here we used fMRI to monitor brain activity while adult humans (n = 60) were presented with visual-only, auditory-only, and audiovisual words. The audiovisual words were presented in quiet and several signal-to-noise ratios. As expected, audiovisual speech perception recruited both auditory and visual cortex, with some evidence for increased recruitment of premotor cortex in some conditions (including in substantial background noise). We then investigated neural connectivity using psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis with seed regions in both primary auditory cortex and primary visual cortex. Connectivity between auditory and visual cortices was stronger in audiovisual conditions than in unimodal conditions, including a wide network of regions in posterior temporal cortex and prefrontal cortex. In addition to whole-brain analyses, we also conducted a region-of-interest analysis on the left posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), implicated in many previous studies of audiovisual speech perception. We found evidence for both activity and effective connectivity in pSTS for visual-only and audiovisual speech, although these were not significant in whole-brain analyses. Taken together, our results suggest a prominent role for cross-region synchronization in understanding both visual-only and audiovisual speech that complements activity in \"integrative\" brain regions like pSTS.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe hormone gibberellin (GA) promotes arabidopsis growth by enhancing binding between GA Insensitive DELLA transcriptional repressors and GA Insensitive Dwarf 1 (GID1) receptors to regulate DELLA degradation. The binding mechanism for GA was elucidated by employing a computational study of dissociations of the N-terminus of the DELLA family member GAI (GA Insensitive transcriptional repressor) from the GID1A receptor in the presence and absence of bound GA, and of GA from GID1A in the presence and absence of GAI. The tRAMD method was employed to deduce egression pathways for a diverse set of GA molecules (GA(x)). Two pathways in the form of a newly identified cleft and a previously identified channel are prevalent. The cleft pathway is open in the absence of GAI. Upon GAI binding, the cleft route is blocked, resulting in a slower process for GA(x) to exit and enter the binding pocket through the channel. Several binding pocket residues are identified as gate-keepers to the channel. Molecular recognition features (MoRFs) found in the disordered signaling protein GAI affect GA(x) binding and GID1A dynamics. A three-step synergistic binding cycle is proposed where GAI MoRFs regulate the process. Rapid binding takes place through the cleft where little to no distinctions are made between major and less active forms of GA(x). After GAI is bound to the GA(x) {middle dot} GID1A complex, the channel supports a rectification process that increases the retention of major active forms of GA within the binding pocket. Both the cleft and channel contact residues to GA(x) are markedly conserved in a GID1 phylogeny, suggesting this binding process in the GID1 {middle dot} DELLA GA-receptor complex represents a general paradigm for GA binding. Non-specific GA binding assists binding of GAI, which then helps to select the major active forms of the hormone and induce a downstream signalling cascade in response to bioactive GA.\n\nNon-expert Summary StatementGibberellins are plant hormones essential for growth and development. The DELLA proteins are a disordered family of repressors that transcriptionally repress GA responsive genes. Degradation of DELLA proteins in response to GA results in GA-responsive genes being upregulated. Binding of GA to the GA-Insensitive Dwarf 1 receptor (GID1) facilitates binding of DELLA to the GA {middle dot} GID1 complex. Through computational modelling and phylogenetic analyses, we identified a new GA binding cleft that is blocked by DELLA binding and a three-step mechanism for the GA {middle dot} DELLA {middle dot} GID1 complex that also involves the known GA binding channel. We propose a dual (cleft/channel) pathway that allows access to the binding pocket as a paradigm for selection of specific GA forms among a mixture of major active and inactive forms. The cleft is less selective, but preference for active GA in the binding pocket of GID1A is amplified by expunging inactive GA forms, followed by recruiting active forms through the more selective channel. This mechanism allows plants to sense concentration changes of GA with high specificity to enable certain GA variants to trigger specific signalling events. These novel insights into the receptor mechanism in part may explain the large number of different GA forms that exist in nature.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=113 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/422840v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (38K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a7b6e5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d89799org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c8ee74org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9f31c6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "We propose a new problem whose input data are two linear genomes together with two indexed gene subsequences of them, which asks to find a longest common exemplar subsequence of the two given genomes with a subsequence identical to the given indexed gene subsequences. We present an algorithm for this problem such that the algorithm is allowed to take diminishing time and space to solve the problem by setting the indexed genes with an incremental number. Although an incremental number of indexed genes were selected, the algorithm was verified definite to reach a solution whose length insistently comes very close to a real longest common exemplar subsequence of the two given genomes.\n\nAiming at 23 human/gorilla chromosome pairs, the algorithm was examined for use in questing for longest common exemplar subsequences whose basic units are annotated genes as well as pseudo genes, namely consecutive DNA subsequences. By contrasting the pseudo gene common exemplar subsequences the algorithm had reached for the human chromosomes 7 and 16 and their gorilla homologues with those annotated genes in the human and gorilla chromosomes, we found more than 1 000 and 500 pseudo genes in the human chromosomes 7 and 16 that occur in the same order as they are in the gorilla chromosomes 7 and 16 and, do not overlap with any annotated gene.\n\nAuthor summaryThere is a benefit of the algorithm: It can reach a long enough common exemplar subsequence of two linear genomes in as fast a speed as one requires even if the given genomes would be equipped with too many duplicated genes, which can be done by setting incremental number of indexed genes. We developed a Java software based on the algorithm, that has been available for download on https://github.com/ShuZhang-sdu/LCES.\n\nOnly in need to set the indexed gene sequences as null, was it verified successful for our algorithm to obtain the longest common exemplar subsequences of the annotated gene summary pairs extracted from 23 human/gorilla chromosome pairs.\n\nIn convenience for researchers to find new motifs or conserved genes, we devoted for the algorithm to quest pseudo gene (i.e. consecutive DNA subsequences) summary pairs of the 23 human/gorilla chromosome pairs for solutions. There are 20 pseudo gene summary pairs whose longest common exemplar subsequences have been found by the algorithm with null indexed gene sequences. The other 3 pseudo gene summary pairs were verified solvable for the algorithm to reach their longest common exemplar subsequences that have to admit subsequences identical to given indexed gene subsequences. There were informed to exist 2 353 and 1 148 pseudo genes in the gorilla chromosome 7 and 16 that occur in the same order as they are in the human chromosome 7 and 16 and, do not overlap with any annotated gene. These pseudo genes should be significant for annotating the human or gorilla genome.",
