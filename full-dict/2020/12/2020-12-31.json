    "abstract": "The N501Y and K417N mutations in spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and their combination arise questions but the data about their mechanism of action at molecular level is limited. Here, we present Free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations for the interactions of the spike S1 receptor binding domain (RBD) with both the ACE2 receptor and an antibody derived from COVID-19 patients. Our results shown that the S1 RBD-ACE2 interactions were significantly increased whereas those with the STE90-C11 antibody dramatically decreased; about over 100 times. The K417N mutation had much more pronounced effect and in a combination with N501Y fully abolished the antibody effect. This may explain the observed in UK and South Africa more spread of the virus but also raise an important question about the possible human immune response and the success of already available vaccines.",

    "abstract": "In honey bees search behavior occurs as social and solitary behavior. In the context of foraging, searching for food sources is performed by behavioral specialized foragers, the scouts. When the scouts have found a new food source, they recruit other foragers (recruits). These recruits never search for a new food source on their own. However, when the food source is experimentally removed, they start searching for that food source. Our study provides a detailed description of this solitary search behavior and the variation of this behavior among individual foragers. Furthermore, mass spectrometric measurement showed that the initiation and performance of this solitary search behavior is associated with changes in glutamate, GABA, histamine, aspartate and the catecholaminergic system in the optic lobes and central brain area. These findings strikingly correspond with the results of an earlier study that showed that scouts and recruits differ in the expression of glutamate and GABA receptors. Together, the results of both studies provide first clear support for the hypothesis that behavioral specialization in honey bees is based on adjusting modulatory systems involved in solitary behavior to increase the probability or frequency of that behavior.",

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic environmental change poses a special threat to species in which genetic sex determination can be overwritten by the thermal and chemical environment. Endocrine disrupting chemicals as well as extreme temperatures can induce sex reversal in such species, with wide-ranging consequences for fitness, demography, population viability and evolution. Despite accumulating evidence suggesting that chemical and thermal effects may interact in ecological contexts, little is known about their combined effects on sex reversal. Here we assessed the simultaneous effects of high temperature (masculinizing agent) and 17-ethinylestradiol (EE2), a widespread xenoestrogen (feminizing agent), on sexual development and fitness-related traits in agile frogs (Rana dalmatina). We exposed tadpoles to a six-days heat wave (30 {degrees}C) and/or an ecologically relevant concentration of EE2 (30 ng/L) in one of three consecutive larval periods, and diagnosed sex reversals two months after metamorphosis using species-specific markers for genetic sexing. We found that high temperature induced female-to-male sex reversal, decreased survival, delayed metamorphosis, decreased body mass at metamorphosis, and increased the proportion of animals that had no fat bodies, while EE2 had no effect on these traits. Simultaneous exposure to heat and EE2 had non-additive effects on juvenile body mass, which were dependent on treatment timing and further complicated by a negative effect of sex reversal on body mass. These results show that environmentally relevant exposure to EE2 does not diminish the masculinizing effects of high temperature. Instead, our findings on growth suggest that climate change and chemical pollution may have complex consequences for individual fitness and population persistence in species with environment-sensitive sex determination.",

    "abstract": "Within the field of bioproduction, non-model organisms offer promise as bio-platform candidates. Non-model organisms can possess natural abilities to consume complex feedstocks, produce industrially useful chemicals, and withstand extreme environments that can be ideal for product extraction. However, non-model organisms also come with unique challenges due to lack of characterization. As a consequence, developing synthetic biology tools, predicting growth behavior, and building computational models can be difficult. There have been many advancements that have improved work with non-model organisms to address broad limitations, however each organism can come with unique surprises. Here we share our work in the non-model bacterium Actinobacillus succinognes 130Z, which includes both advancements in synthetic biology toolkit development and pitfalls in unpredictable fermentation behaviors. To develop a synthetic biology \"tool kit\" for A. succinogenes, information gleaned from a growth study and antibiotic screening was used to characterize 22 promoters which demonstrated a 260-fold range of fluorescence protein expression. The strongest of the promoters was incorporated into an inducible system for tunable gene control in A. succinogenes using the promoter for the lac operon as a template. This system flaunted a 481-fold range of expression and no significant basal expression. These findings were accompanied by unexpected changes in fermentation products characterized by a loss of succinic acid and increase in lactic acid after approximately 10 months in the lab. Contamination and mutation were ruled out as causes and further testing is needed to elucidate the driving factors. The significance of this work is to share tools developed in A. succinogenes while simultaneously serving as a cautionary tale. In sharing our findings, we seek to provide necessary information for further development of A. succinogenes as a platform for bioproduction of succinic acid. Additionally, we hope to illustrate the importance of diligent and long-term observation when working with non-model bacteria.",

    "abstract": "The present study presents a non-surgical approach to assess colonic mechanical sensitivity in mice using colonometry, a technique in which colonic stretch-reflex contractions are measured by recording intracolonic pressures during saline infusion into the distal colon in a constant rate. Colonometrical recording has been used to assess colonic function in healthy individuals and patients with neurological disorders. Here we found that colonometry can also be implemented in mice, with an optimal saline infusion rate of 1.2 mL/h. Colonometrograms showed intermittent pressure rises that was caused by periodical colonic contractions. In the sceneries of colonic hypersensitivity that was generated post 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colonic inflammation, following chemogenetic activation of primary afferent neurons, or immediately after noxious stimulation of the colon by colorectal distension (CRD), the amplitude of intracolonic pressure (AICP) was markedly elevated which was accompanied by a faster pressure rising ({Delta}P/{Delta}t). Colonic hypersensitivity-associated AICP elevation was a result of the enhanced strength of colonic stretch-reflex contraction which reflected the heightened activity of the colonic sensory reflex pathways. The increased value of {Delta}P/{Delta}t in colonic hypersensitivity indicated a lower threshold of colonic mechanical sensation by which colonic stretch-reflex contraction was elicited by a smaller saline infusion volume during a shorter period of infusion time. Chemogenetic inhibition of primary afferent pathway that was governed by Nav1.8-expressing cells attenuated TNBS-induced up-regulations of AICP, {Delta}P/{Delta}t, and colonic pain behavior in response to CRD. These findings support that colonometrograms can be used for analysis of colonic pain in mice.",

    "abstract": "Animal culture and social bonds are relevant to wildlife conservation because they influence patterns of geography, behavior, and strategies of survival. Numerous examples of socially-driven habitat partitioning and ecological-niche specialization can be found among vertebrates, including toothed whales. But such social-ecological dynamics, described here as  social niche partitioning, are not known among baleen whales, whose societies -- particularly on foraging grounds -- are largely perceived as unstructured and incidental to matters of habitat use and conservation. However, through 16 years of behavioral and photo-identification observations of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) feeding within a fjord system in British Columbia, Canada, we have documented long-term pair bonds (lasting up to 12 years) as well as a complex societal structure, which corresponds closely to persistent patterns in feeding strategy, long-term site fidelity (extended seasonal occupancy and annual rate of return up to 75%), specific geographic preferences within the fjord system, and other forms of habitat use. Randomization tests of network congruency and clustering algorithms were used to test for overlap in patterns of social structure and habitat use, which confirmed the occurrence of social niche partitioning on the feeding grounds of this baleen whale. In addition, we document the extensive practice of group bubble net feeding in Pacific Canada. This coordinated feeding behavior was found to strongly mediate the social structure and habitat use within this humpback whale society. Additionally, during our 2004 - 2019 study, we observed a shift in social network structure in 2010 - 2012, which corresponded with environmental and demographic shifts including a sudden decline in the populations calving rate. Our findings indicate that the social lives of humpback whales, and perhaps baleen whales generally, are more complex than previously supposed and should be a primary consideration in the assessment of potential impacts to important habitat.",

    "abstract": "The study of low abundance proteins is a challenge to discovery-based proteomics. Mass-spectrometry (MS) applications, such as thermal proteome profiling (TPP) face specific challenges in detection of the whole proteome as a consequence of the use of nondenaturing extraction buffers. TPP is a powerful method for the study of protein thermal stability, but quantitative accuracy is highly dependent on consistent detection. Therefore, TPP can be limited in its amenability to study low abundance proteins that tend to have stochastic or poor detection by MS. To address this challenge, we incorporated an affinity purified protein complex sample at submolar concentrations as an isobaric trigger channel into a mutant TPP (mTPP) workflow to provide reproducible detection and quantitation of the low abundance subunits of the Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factor (CPF) complex. The inclusion of an isobaric protein complex trigger channel increased detection an average of 40x for previously detected subunits and facilitated detection of CPF subunits that were previously below the limit of detection. Importantly, these gains in CPF detection did not cause large changes in melt temperature (Tm) calculations for other unrelated proteins in the samples, with a high positive correlation between Tm estimates in samples with and without isobaric trigger channel addition. Overall, the incorporation of affinity purified protein complex as an isobaric trigger channel within a TMT multiplex for mTPP experiments is an effective and reproducible way to gather thermal profiling data on proteins that are not readily detected using the original TPP or mTPP protocols.",

    "abstract": "The synaptonemal complex (SC) is a supramolecular protein assembly that mediates synapsis between homologous chromosomes during meiosis. SC elongation along the chromosome length (up to 24 m) depends on its midline -fibrous component SYCE2-TEX12. Here, we report X-ray crystal structures of SYCE2-TEX12 as an individual building-block and upon assembly within a fibrous lattice. We combine these structures with mutagenesis, biophysics and electron microscopy to reveal the hierarchical mechanism of SYCE2-TEX12 fibre assembly. SYCE2-TEX12s building-blocks are 2:2 coiled-coils which dimerise into 4:4 hetero-oligomers and interact end-to-end and laterally to form 10-nm fibres, which intertwine within 40-nm bundled micrometre-long fibres that define the SCs midline structure. This assembly mechanism bears striking resemblance with intermediate filament proteins vimentin, lamin and keratin. Thus, SYCE2-TEX12 exhibits behaviour typical of cytoskeletal proteins to provide an -fibrous SC backbone that structurally underpins synaptic elongation along meiotic chromosomes.",

It is produced by the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, which has a small, stream-lined genome, assumed to be free from gene clusters for secondary metabolite synthesis. In this study, we identified the pathway for the synthesis of 7-deoxysedoheptulose. It originates from 5-deoxyadenosine, a toxic byproduct of radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzymes, present in all domains of life. Thereby we identified a novel 5-deoxyadenosine salvage pathway, which first leads to the synthesis and excretion of 5-deoxyribose and subsequently of 7-deoxysedoheptulose. Remarkably, all reaction steps are conducted by promiscuous enzymes. This is a unique example for the synthesis of a bioactive compound without involving a specific gene cluster. This challenges the view on bioactive molecule synthesis by extending the range of possible compounds beyond the options predicted from secondary metabolite gene clusters.",

    "abstract": "The high affinity of biotin to streptavidin has made it one of the most widely used affinity tags in proteomics. Early methods used biotin for enrichment alone and mostly ignored the biotin labeled peptide. Recent advances in labeling led to an increase in biotinylation efficiency and shifted the interest to detection of the site of biotinylation. This increased confidence in identification and provides additional structural information yet it requires efficient release of the biotinylated protein/peptide and sensitive separation and detection of biotinylated peptides by LC-MS/MS. Despite its long use in affinity proteomics the effect of biotinylation on the chromatographic, ionization, and fragmentation behaviour and ultimate detection of peptides is not well understood. To address this we compare two commercially-available biotin labels EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin and Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin, the latter one containing a labile linker to efficiently release biotin to determine the effects of peptide modification on peptide detection. We describe an increase of hydrophobicity and charge reduction with increasing number of biotin labels attached. Based on our data we recommend gradient optimization to account for more hydrophobic biotinylated peptides and include singly charged precursors to account for charge reduction by biotin.",

Degree of NAFLD was based on liver ultrasound and of OSA on overnight polysomnography.\n\nResultIn IRS1 gene, the genotype frequency (%) of Arg/Arg was significantly higher in NAFLD and OSA subjects. In addition, Gly/Arg genotype of IRS1 gene was associated with significantly higher body mass index, fat mass, %body fat, triglycerides, cholesterol, alkaline phosphate, aspartate transaminase, fasting insulin and HOMA-IR levels in OSA and NAFLD subjects. No significant difference in genotype frequencies of IRS2 was observed between four groups. Further we found that subjects carrying IRS1 Gly/Arg (OR 4.49, 95% C.I. 1.06-12.52, p=0.002) genotype possess a much higher risk of OSA and NAFLD compared to IRS2 Gly/Asp (OR 1.01, 95% C.I. 0.8-2.56, p=0.05).\n\nConclusionWe concluded that Asian Indian subject carrying the allele Gly972Arg polymorphism of IRS1 is predisposed to develop OSA and NAFLD.",

    "abstract": "Decellularized porcine corneal scaffolds are a potential alternative to human cornea for keratoplasty. Although clinical trials have reported promising results, there can be corneal haze or scar tissue. Here, we examined if recellularizing the scaffolds with human keratocytes would result in a better outcome. Scaffolds were prepared that retained little DNA (14.89 {+/-} 5.56 ng/mg) and demonstrated a lack of cytotoxicity by in vitro. The scaffolds were recellularized using human corneal stromal cells and cultured for between 14 in serum-supplemented media followed by a further 14 days in either serum free or serum-supplemented media. All groups showed full-depth cell penetration after 14 days. When serum was present, staining for ALDH3A1 remained weak but after serum-free culture, staining was brighter and the keratocytes adopted a native dendritic morphology with an increase (p < 0.05) of keratocan, decorin, lumican and CD34 gene expression. A rabbit anterior lamellar keratoplasty model was used to compare implanting a 250 {micro}m thick decellularized lenticule against one that had been recellularized with human stromal cells. In both groups, host rabbit epithelium covered the implants, but transparency was not restored after 3 months. Post-mortem histology showed under the epithelium, a less-compact collagen layer, which appeared to be a regenerating zone with some -SMA staining, indicating fibrotic cells. In the posterior scaffold, ALDH1A1 staining was present in all the acellular scaffold, but in only one of the recellularized lenticules. We conclude that recellularization with keratocytes alone may not be sufficiently beneficial to justify introducing allogeneic cells without concurrent treatment to further manage keratocyte phenotype.",

Despite the miniscule structural changes due to point mutants, the observed significant binding affinity differences have previously been assessed with a focus on two -helices located at the binding groove (2) and the C-terminus (3). Here, we employ a new computational approach to develop a generalized view on the molecular basis of PDZ3 binding selectivity and interaction communication for a set of point mutants of the protein (G330T, H372A, G330T-H372A) and its ligand (CRIPT named L1 and its T-2F variant L2) along with the wild type (WT). To analyze the dynamical aspects hidden in the conformations that are produced by molecular dynamics simulations, we utilize variations in community composition calculated based on the betweenness centrality measure from graph theory. We find that the highly charged N-terminus which is located far from the ligand has the propensity to share the same community with the ligand in the biologically functional complexes, indicating a distal segment might mediate the binding dynamics. N- and C-termini of PDZ3 share communities, and 3 acts as a hub for the whole protein by sustaining the communication with all structural segments, albeit being a trait not unique to the functional complexes. Moreover, 2 which lines the binding cavity frequently parts communities with the ligand and is not a controller of the binding but is rather a slave to the overall dynamics coordinated by the N-terminus. Thus, ligand binding fate in PDZ3 is traced to the population of community compositions extracted from dynamics despite the lack of significant conformational changes.",

    "abstract": "Multivalent polymers are a key structural component of many biocondensates. When interacting with their cognate binding proteins, multivalent polymers such as RNA and modular proteins have been shown to influence the liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) boundary to control condensate formation and to influence condensate dynamics after phase separation. Much is still unknown about the function and formation of these condensed droplets, but changes in their dynamics or phase separation are associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimers Disease. Therefore, investigation into how the structure of multivalent polymers relates to changes in biocondensate formation and maturation is essential to understanding and treating these diseases. Here, we use a coarse-grain, Brownian Dynamics simulation with reactive binding that mimics specific interactions in order to investigate the difference between non-specific and specific multivalent binding polymers. We show that non-specific binding interactions can lead to much larger changes in droplet formation at lower energies than their specific, valence-limited counterparts. We also demonstrate the effects of solvent conditions and polymer length on phase separation, and we present how modulating binding energy to the polymer can change the organization of a droplet in a three component system of polymer, binding protein, and solvent. Finally, we compare the effects of surface tension and polymer binding on the condensed phase dynamics, where we show that both lower protein solubilities and higher attraction/affinity of the protein to the polymer result in slower droplet dynamics. We hope this research helps to better understand experimental systems and provides additional insight into how multivalent polymers can control LLPS.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin interactions play important roles in regulating gene expression. However, the availability of genome-wide chromatin interaction data is limited. Various computational methods have been developed to predict chromatin interactions. Most of these methods rely on large collections of ChIP-Seq/RNA-Seq/DNase-Seq datasets and predict only enhancer-promoter interactions. Some of the  state-of-the-art methods have poor experimental designs, leading to over-exaggerated performances and misleading conclusions. Here we developed a computational method, Chromatin Interaction Neural Network (ChINN), to predict chromatin interactions between open chromatin regions by using only DNA sequences of the interacting open chromatin regions. ChINN is able to predict CTCF-, RNA polymerase II- and HiC-associated chromatin interactions between open chromatin regions. ChINN also shows good across-sample performances and captures various sequence features that are predictive of chromatin interactions. To apply our results to clinical patient data, we applied CHINN to predict chromatin interactions in 6 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patient samples and a cohort of open chromatin data from 84 CLL samples that was previously published. Our results demonstrated extensive heterogeneity in chromatin interactions in patient samples, and one of the sources of this heterogeneity were the different subtypes of CLL.",

Such mice are viable, with relatively mild pathologies, but show delay in onset of certain cancers. However, many phenotypes arising from germline gene perturbation are indirect consequences of adaptive developmental compensation and so do not translate to equivalent phenotypes when applied to adults. To ascertain whether systemic Myc hypomorphism also conferred cancer protection when acutely imposed in adults, and what the side-effects of this might be, we constructed a genetically engineered mouse model in which Myc expression may be systemically and reversibly hypomorphed at will. Acute imposition of Myc hypomorphism in adult mice conferred potent protection against both KRasG12D-driven lung and pancreatic cancers yet elicited only mild haematopoietic side effects. These side effects were completely suppressed by imposing Myc hypomorphism metronomically - a regimen that nonetheless retained potent cancer prophylaxis. Our data identify a key bottleneck at the transition from pre-malignant hyperplasia to overt tumour that is peculiarly reliant on levels of Myc that are higher than those required for most adult physiology, offering a possible window of opportunity for Myc inhibition in cancer prophylaxis.",

Nucleoside-modified mRNAs formulated in lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNP) have proved to be a potent mode of immunization against infectious diseases in preclinical studies, and are being tested for SARS-CoV-2 in humans. A critical question is how mRNA-LNP vaccine immunogenicity compares to that of traditional adjuvanted protein vaccines in primates. Here, we found that mRNA-LNP immunization compared to protein immunization elicited either the same or superior magnitude and breadth of HIV-1 Env-specific polyfunctional antibodies. Immunization with mRNA-LNP encoding Zika premembrane and envelope (prM-E) or HIV-1 Env gp160 induced durable neutralizing antibodies for at least 41 weeks. Doses of mRNA-LNP as low as 5 g were immunogenic in macaques. Thus, mRNA-LNP can be used to rapidly generate single or multi-component vaccines, such as sequential vaccines needed to protect against HIV-1 infection. Such vaccines would be as or more immunogenic than adjuvanted recombinant protein vaccines in primates.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1 infects lymphoid and myeloid cells, which can harbor a latent proviral reservoir responsible for maintaining lifelong infection. Glycolytic metabolism has been identified as a determinant of susceptibility to HIV-1 infection, but its role in the development and maintenance of HIV-1 latency has not been elucidated. By combining transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic analysis, we here show that transition to latent HIV-1 infection downregulates glycolysis, while viral reactivation by conventional stimuli reverts this effect. Decreased glycolytic output in latently infected cells is associated with downregulation of NAD+/NADH. Consequently, infected cells rely on the parallel pentose phosphate pathway and its main product, the antioxidant NADPH, fueling antioxidant pathways maintaining HIV-1 latency. Of note, blocking NADPH downstream effectors, thioredoxin and glutathione, favors HIV-1 reactivation from latency in lymphoid and myeloid cellular models. This provides a \"shock and kill effect\" decreasing proviral DNA in cells from people-living-with-HIV/AIDS. Overall, our data show that downmodulation of glycolysis is a metabolic signature of HIV-1 latency that can be exploited to target latently infected cells with eradication strategies.",

Our data examining lbx expression in Scyliorhinus canicula and Xenopus tropicalis suggest that the spinal interneuron expression of zebrafish lbx1a is ancestral, whereas lbx1b has acquired a new expression pattern in spinal cord progenitor cells. lbx2 spinal expression was probably acquired in the ray-finned lineage, as this gene is not expressed in the spinal cords of either amniotes or S. canicula. We also show that the spinal function of zebrafish lbx1a is conserved with mouse Lbx1. In zebrafish lbx1a mutants, there is a reduction in the number of inhibitory spinal interneurons and an increase in the number of excitatory spinal interneurons, similar to mouse Lbx1 mutants. Interestingly, the number of inhibitory spinal interneurons is also reduced in lbx1b mutants, although in this case the number of excitatory interneurons is not increased. lbx1a;lbx1b double mutants have a similar spinal interneuron phenotype to lbx1a single mutants. Taken together these data suggest that lbx1b and lbx1a may be required in succession for correct specification of dI4 and dI6 spinal interneurons, although only lbx1a is required for suppression of excitatory fates in these cells.\n\nResearch Highlightslbx1 spinal expression and function is conserved in vertebrates.

We selected mosquitoes as modal organisms, because selection of an oviposition site by adult female mosquitoes in response to its perceived attractiveness is of paramount importance for the development and survival of their larval offspring. In laboratory and/or field experiments, we show that (i) each of five cheese varieties tested (Raclette, Pecorino, Brie, Gruyere, Limburger) strongly attracts females of both the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, and the common house mosquito, Cx. pipiens; (ii) cheese infusions, or headspace odorant extracts (HOEs) of cheese infusions, significantly affect oviposition choices by Cx. pipiens and Ae. aegypti, (iii) HOEs contain at least 13 odorants; (iv) in field settings, cheese infusions more effectively stimulate oviposition by Cx. pipiens and Culiseta incidens than bluegrass (Poa sp.) infusions, and also capture (by drowning) the spotted wing Drosophila (SWD); (v) the microbe composition of home-made cheese infusions modulates oviposition choices by mosquitoes; and (vi) the type of cheese infusion coupled with its nutritional content strongly affects the survivorship of mosquito larvae. In combination, our data show that microbial metabolites associated with cheese and cheese infusions are both attractive to adult mosquitoes seeking hosts and oviposition sites, respectively, and are toxic to mosquito larvae. These microbes and their metabolites could thus be coopted for both the attract and the kill function of \"attract & kill\" mosquito control tactics. Implementation of customizable and non-conventional nutritional media, such as home-made cheese infusions, as microbe-based ecological traps presents a promising concept which exploits insect ecology for insect control.",

To complement experimental approaches, which usually take a considerable amount of time and resources, various computational methods have been developed to predict the structures of protein complexes. In computational modeling, one of the challenges is to identify near-native structures from a large pool of generated models.

To evaluate a protein docking model, GNN-DOVE extracts the interface area and represents it as a graph. The chemical properties of atoms and the inter-atom distances are used as features of nodes and edges in the graph. GNN-DOVE was trained and validated on docking models in the Dockground database.
