    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 amino acid replacements in the receptor binding domain (RBD) occur relatively frequently and some have a consequence for immune recognition. Here we report recurrent emergence and significant onward transmission of a six-nucleotide out of frame deletion in the S gene, which results in loss of two amino acids: H69 and V70. We report that in human infections {Delta}H69/V70 often co-occurs with the receptor binding motif amino acid replacements N501Y, N439K and Y453F, and in the latter two cases has followed the RBD mutation. One of the {Delta}H69/V70+ N501Y lineages, now known as B.1.1.7, has undergone rapid expansion and includes eight S gene mutations: RBD (N501Y and A570D), S1 ({Delta}H69/V70 and {Delta}144) and S2 (P681H, T716I, S982A and D1118H). In vitro, we show that {Delta}H69/V70 does not reduce serum neutralisation across multiple convalescent sera. However, {Delta}H69/V70 increases infectivity and is associated with increased incorporation of cleaved spike into virions. {Delta}H69/V70 is able to compensate for small infectivity defects induced by RBD mutations N501Y, N439K and Y453F. In addition, replacement of H69 and V70 residues in the B.1.1.7 spike reduces its infectivity and spike mediated cell-cell fusion. Based on our data {Delta}H69/V70 likely acts as a permissive mutation that allows acquisition of otherwise deleterious immune escape mutations. Enhanced surveillance for the {Delta}H69/V70 deletion with and without RBD mutations should be considered as a global priority not only as a marker for the B.1.1.7 variant, but potentially also for other emerging variants of concern. Vaccines designed to target the deleted spike protein could mitigate against its emergence as increased selective forces from immunity and vaccines increase globally.\n\nHighlightsO_LI{Delta}H69/V70 is present in at least 28 SARS-CoV-2 lineages\nC_LIO_LI{Delta}H69/V70 does not confer escape from convalescent sera\nC_LIO_LI{Delta}H69/V70 increases spike infectivity and compensates for RBD mutations\nC_LIO_LI{Delta}H69/V70 is associated with greater spike cleavage\nC_LIO_LIB.1.1.7 requires {Delta}H69/V70 for optimal spike cleavage and infectivity\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Biofilms complete a life cycle where cells aggregate, grow and produce a structured community before dispersing to seed biofilms in new environments. Progression through this life cycle requires temporally controlled gene expression to maximise fitness at each stage. Previous studies have largely focused on the essential genome for the formation of a mature biofilm, but here we present an insight into the genes involved at different stages of biofilm formation. We used TraDIS-Xpress; a massively parallel transposon mutagenesis approach using transposon-located promoters to assay the impact of disruption or altered expression of all genes in the genome on biofilm formation. We determined temporal differences in the importance of genes in E. coli growing as a biofilm on glass beads after 12, 24 and 48 hours. A selection of genes identified as important were then validated independently by assaying biofilm biomass, aggregation, curli production and adhesion ability of defined mutants. We identified 48 genes that affected biofilm fitness including genes with known roles and those not previously implicated in biofilm formation. Regulation of type 1 fimbriae and motility were important at all time points. Adhesion and motility were important for the early biofilm, whereas matrix production and purine biosynthesis were only important as the biofilm matured. We found strong temporal contributions to biofilm fitness for some genes including some where expression changed between being beneficial or detrimental depending on the stage at which they are expressed, including dksA and dsbA. Novel genes implicated in biofilm formation included zapE and truA involved in cell division, maoP in DNA housekeeping and yigZ and ykgJ of unknown function. This work provides new insights into the requirements for successful biofilm formation through the biofilm life cycle and demonstrates the importance of understanding expression and fitness through time.",

    "abstract": "One often observes small but measurable differences in diffraction data measured from different crystals of a single protein. These differences might reflect structural differences in the protein and potentially reflect the natural dynamism of the molecule in solution. Partitioning these mixed-state data into single-state clusters is a critical step to extract information about the dynamic behavior of proteins from hundreds or thousands of single-crystal data sets. Mixed-state data can be obtained deliberately (through intentional perturbation) or inadvertently (while attempting to measure highly redundant single-crystal data). State changes may be expressed as changes in morphology, so that a subset of the polystates may be observed as polymorphs. After mixed-state data are deliberately or inadvertently measured, the challenge is to sort the data into clusters that may represent relevant biological polystates. Here we address this problem using a simple multi-factor clustering approach that classifies each data set using independent observables in order to assign each data set to the correct location in conformation space. We illustrate this method using two independent observables (unit cell constants and intensities) to cluster mixed-state data from chymotrypsinogen (ChTg) crystals. We observe that the data populate an arc of the reaction trajectory as ChTg is converted into chymotrypsin.",

    "abstract": "The fitness of a pathogen is a composite phenotype determined by many different factors influencing growth rates both within and between hosts. Determining what factors shape fitness at the host population-level is especially challenging because both intrinsic factors like pathogen genetics and extrinsic factors such as host behaviour influence between-host transmission potential. These challenges have been highlighted by controversy surrounding the population-level fitness effects of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and their relative importance when compared against non-genetic factors shaping transmission dynamics. Building upon phylodynamic birth-death models, we develop a new framework to learn how hundreds of genetic and non-genetic factors have shaped the fitness of SARS-CoV-2. We estimate the fitness effects of all amino acid variants and several structural variants that have circulated in the United States between February 2020 and March 2021 from viral phylogenies. We also estimate how much fitness variation among pathogen lineages is attributable to genetic versus non-genetic factors such as spatial heterogeneity in transmission rates. Before September 2020, most fitness variation between lineages can be explained by background spatial heterogeneity in transmission rates across geographic regions. Starting in late 2020, genetic variation in fitness increased dramatically with the emergence of several new lineages including B.1.1.7, B.1.427, B.1.429 and B.1.526. Our analysis also indicates that genetic variants in less well-explored genomic regions outside of Spike may be contributing significantly to overall fitness variation in the viral population.",

    "abstract": "Malate is a major contributor to the sourness of grape berries (Vitis spp.) and their products, such as wine. Excessive malate at maturity, commonly observed in wild Vitis grapes, is detrimental to grape and wine quality and complicates the introgression of valuable disease resistance and cold hardy genes through breeding. This study investigated an interspecific Vitis family that exhibited strong and stable variation in malate at ripeness for five years and tested the separate contribution of accumulation, degradation, and dilution to malate concentration in ripe fruit in the last year of study. Genotyping was performed using transferable rhAmpSeq haplotype markers, based on the Vitis collinear core genome. Three significant QTL for ripe fruit malate on chromosomes 1, 7, and 17, accounted for over two-fold and 6.9 g/L differences in ripe fruit malate, and explained 40.6% of the phenotypic variation. QTL on chromosomes 7 and 17 were stable in all and in three out of five years, respectively. Variation in pre-veraison malate was the major contributor to variation in ripe fruit malate (39%) and their associated QTL overlapped on chromosome 7, indicating a common genetic basis. However, use of transferable markers on a closely related Vitis family did not yield a common QTL across families. This suggests that diverse physiological mechanisms regulate the levels of this key metabolite in the Vitis genus, a conclusion supported by a review of over a dozen publications from the past decade, showing malate-associated genetic loci on all 19 chromosomes.",

Kleborate provides a framework to support genomic surveillance and epidemiology in research, clinical and public health settings. To demonstrate its utility we apply Kleborate to analyse publicly available Klebsiella genomes, including clinical isolates from a pan-European study of carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella, highlighting global trends in AMR and virulence as examples of what could be achieved by applying this genomic framework within more systematic genomic surveillance efforts. We also demonstrate the application of Kleborate to detect and type K. pneumoniae from gut metagenomes.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) constitute 50% of the human genome and many have been co-opted throughout human evolution due to gain of advantageous regulatory functions controlling gene expression networks. Several lines of evidence suggest these networks can be fine-tuned by the largest family of TE controllers, the KRAB-containing zinc finger proteins (KZFPs). One tissue permissive for TE transcriptional activation (termed  transposcription) is the adult human brain, however comprehensive studies on the extent of this process and its potential contribution to human brain development are lacking.\n\nIn order to elucidate the spatiotemporal transposcriptome of the developing human brain, we have analysed two independent RNA-seq datasets encompassing 16 distinct brain regions from eight weeks post-conception into adulthood. We reveal an anti-correlated, KZFP:TE transcriptional profile defining the late prenatal to early postnatal transition, and the spatiotemporal and cell type specific activation of TE-derived alternative promoters driving the expression of neurogenesis-associated genes. We also demonstrate experimentally that a co-opted antisense L2 element drives temporal protein re-localisation away from the endoplasmic reticulum, suggestive of novel TE dependent protein function in primate evolution. This work highlights the widespread dynamic nature of the spatiotemporal KZFP:TE transcriptome and its potential importance throughout neurotypical human brain development.",

    "abstract": "Cytosine modifications in DNA such as 5-methylcytosine (5mC) underlie a broad range of developmental processes, maintain cellular lineage specification, and can define or stratify cancer and other diseases. However, the wide variety of approaches available to interrogate these modifications has created a need for harmonized materials, methods, and rigorous benchmarking to improve genome-wide methylome sequencing applications in clinical and basic research. Here, we present a multi-platform assessment and a global resource for epigenetics research from the FDAs Epigenomics Quality Control (EpiQC) Group. The study design leverages seven human cell lines that are designated as reference materials and publicly available from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) consortium. These samples were subject to a variety of genome-wide methylation interrogation approaches across six independent laboratories, with a primary focus was on 5-methylcytosine modifications. Each sample was processed in two or more technical replicates by three whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) protocols (TruSeq DNA methylation, Accel-NGS MethylSeq, and SPLAT), oxidative bisulfite sequencing (TrueMethyl), one enzymatic deamination method (EMseq), targeted methylation sequencing (Illumina Methyl Capture EPIC), and single-molecule long-read nanopore sequencing from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. After rigorous quality assessment and comparison to Illumina EPIC methylation microarrays and testing on a range of algorithms (Bismark, BitmapperBS, BWAMeth, and GemBS), we found overall high concordance between assays (R=0.87-R0.93), differences in efficency of read mapping and CpG capture and coverage, and platform performance. The data provided herein can guide continued used of these reference materials in epigenomics assays, as well as provide best practices for epigenomics research and experimental design in future studies.",

    "abstract": "Genome editing can introduce designed mutations into a target genomic site. Recent research has revealed that it can also induce various unintended events such as structural variations, small indels, and substitutions at, and in some cases, away from the target site. These rearrangements may result in confounding phenotypes in biomedical research samples and cause a concern in clinical or agricultural applications. However, current genotyping methods do not allow a comprehensive analysis of diverse mutations for phasing and mosaic variant detection. Here, we developed a genotyping method with an on-target site analysis software named Determine Allele mutations and Judge Intended genotype by Nanopore sequencer (DAJIN) that can automatically identify and classify both intended and unintended diverse mutations, including point mutations, deletions, inversions, and cis double knock-in at single-nucleotide resolution. Our approach with DAJIN can handle approximately 100 samples under different editing conditions in a single run. With its high versatility, scalability, and convenience, DAJIN-assisted multiplex genotyping may become a new standard for validating genome editing outcomes.",

Since wood-free whitewater is usually a mixture of additives for paper production and an efficient cost-effective purification technology for their removal is lacking, the aim of our study was to find an effective bio-based strategy for whitewater treatment using a selection of indigenous bacterial isolates. We first obtained a large collection of bacterial isolates and then tested them individually for their ability to degrade the organic additives used in papermaking, i.e. carbohydrates, resin acids, alkyl ketene dimers, polyvinyl alcohol, latex, and azo and fluorescent dyes. Out of the 355 bacterial isolates, we selected a combination of four strains (Xanthomonadales bacterium sp. CST37-CF, Sphingomonas sp. BLA14-CF, Cellulosimicrobium sp. AKD4-BF and Aeromonas sp.

A proof-of-concept study in pilot scale was then performed by immobilizing the cells of our artificial bacterial consortium in a 33-liter tubular flow-through reactor with a retention time of <15 h. The combination of the four native strains enabled an 88% reduction in COD of whitewater even after 21 days.

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis remains a critical infectious disease world-wide. The development of novel therapeutic strategies requires greater understanding of host factors that contribute to disease susceptibility. A major unknown in TB pathogenesis is the mechanism of necrosis in TB granulomas that leads to the massive lung tissue damage and cavity formation necessary for the pathogen transmission. In humans, TB progression has been linked to hyperactivity of type I IFN (IFN-I) pathway, the primary cause of which remains elusive.\n\nWe studied the mechanistic drivers of pulmonary TB progression using a unique model B6J.C3-Sst1C3HeB/Fej Krmn mice that develop human-like necrotic TB granulomas and IFN-I hyperactivity. We established that IFN{beta} super-induction occurred in the susceptible macrophages in response to continuous TNF stimulation in the context of a dysregulated antioxidant defense. We observed that unresolving oxidative stress amplified the induction of IFN{beta} through JNK activation and induced the Integrated Stress Response via PKR activation as a compensatory pathway. Subsequently, PKR amplifies IFN{beta} upregulation, forming a positive feedback loop, maintaining the hyperinflammatory state in susceptible macrophages and leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus, within the inflammatory milieu, a cell-intrinsic mechanism of chronic regulatory dysfunction and unresolved stress gradually weakens the macrophage and ultimately promotes the necrotization of TB granulomas. The aberrant macrophage response to TNF can be prevented by an iron chelator and inhibitor of lipid peroxidation, ferrostatin-1. Moreover, ferrostatin treatment increased macrophage survival and boosted bacterial control in the TNF-stimulated macrophages infected with virulent Mtb. These findings identify targets for host-directed therapeutics to interrupt necrotization in TB granulomas.",

    "abstract": "AROMATASE, encoded by the CYP19A1 gene, is the cytochrome enzyme responsible for the synthesis of estrogens in vertebrates. In most mammals a peak of expression of the CYP19A1 gene occurs in the fetal XX gonad when sexual differentiation starts up. To elucidate the role of this peak, we produced 3 lines of TALEN genetically edited CYP19A1 KO rabbits, that were void of any production of estradiol. All KO XX rabbits developed as females, with aberrantly small sized ovaries at adulthood, an almost empty reserve of primordial follicles and very few large antrum follicles. Ovulation never occurred. Our histological, immunohistological and transcriptomic analyses showed that the surge of estradiol in the XX fetal rabbit gonad is dispensable for its determination as an ovary, or for meiosis. However, it is mandatory for the high proliferation and differentiation of both somatic and germ cells, and consequently for the establishment of the ovarian reserve.",

    "abstract": "Explaining the emergence and maintenance of intratumor heterogeneity is an important question in cancer biology. Tumor cells can generate considerable subclonal diversity, which influences tumor growth rate, treatment resistance, and metastasis, yet we know remarkably little about how cells from different subclones interact. Here, we confronted two murine mammary cancer cell lines to determine both the nature and mechanisms of subclonal cellular interactions in vitro. Surprisingly, we found that, compared to monoculture, growth of the  winner was enhanced by the presence of the  loser cell line, whereas growth of the latter was reduced. Mathematical modeling and laboratory assays indicated that these interactions are mediated by the production of paracrine metabolites resulting in the winner subclone effectively  farming the loser. Our findings add a new level of complexity to the mechanisms underlying subclonal growth dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Beta oscillatory activity (13-30Hz) is pervasive within the cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) network. Studies in Parkinsons disease (PD) patients and animal models suggested that beta-power increases with dopamine depletion. However, the exact relationship between oscillatory power, frequency and dopamine-tone remains unclear. We recorded neural activity in the CBG network of non-human-primates (NHP) while acutely up- and down-modulating dopamine levels. Further, we assessed changes in beta oscillations of PD patients following acute and chronic changes in dopamine-tone. Beta oscillation frequency was strongly coupled with dopamine-tone in both NHPs and human patients. In contrast, power, coherence between single-units and LFP, and spike-LFP phase-locking were not systematically regulated by dopamine levels. These results demonstrate via causal manipulations that frequency, rather than other properties, is the key property of pathological oscillations in the CBG networks. These insights can lead to improvements in understanding of CBG physiology, PD progression tracking and patient care.",

    "abstract": "MotivationPolysome profiling is novel, and yet has proved to be an effective approach to detect mRNAs with differential ribosomal load and explore the regulatory mechanisms driving efficient translation. Genes encoding regulatory proteins, having a great influence of the organism, usually reveal moderate to low transcriptional levels, compared, for example, to genes of house-keeping machinery. This complicates the reliable detection of such genes in the presence of technical and/or biological noise.\n\nResultsIn this work we investigate how cleaning of polysome profiling data on Arabidopsis thaliana influences the ability to detect genes with low level of total mRNA, but with a highly differential ribosomal load, i.e. genes translationally active. Suggested data modelling approach to identify a background level of mRNA counts individually for each dataset, shows higher power in detection of low transcribed genes, compared to the use of thresholds for the minimal required mRNA counts or the use of raw data. The significant increase in detected number of regulation-related genes was demonstrated. The described approach is applicable to a wide variety of RNA-seq data. All identified and classified mRNAs with high and low translation status are made available in supplementary material.",

    "abstract": "Primary motor cortex (M1) undergoes protracted development in mammals, functioning initially as a sensory structure. Throughout the first postnatal week in rats, M1 is strongly activated by self-generated forelimb movements--especially by the twitches that occur during active sleep. Here, we quantify the kinematic features of forelimb movements to reveal receptive-field properties of individual units within the forelimb region of M1. At postnatal day (P) 8, nearly all units were strongly modulated by movement amplitude, especially during active sleep. By P12, only a minority of units continued to exhibit amplitude-tuning, regardless of behavioral state. At both ages, movement direction also modulated M1 activity, though to a lesser extent. Finally, at P12, M1 population-level activity became more sparse and decorrelated, along with a substantial alteration in the statistical distribution of M1 responses to limb movements. These findings reveal a transition toward a more complex and informationally rich representation of movement long before M1 develops its motor functionality.",

    "abstract": "The inability of neurons to regenerate long axons within the CNS is a major impediment to improving outcome after spinal cord injury, stroke, and other CNS insults. Recent advances have uncovered an intrinsic program that involves coordinate regulation by multiple transcription factors that can be manipulated to enhance growth in the peripheral nervous system. Here, we used a system-genomics approach to characterize regulatory relationships of regeneration-associated transcription factors, identifying RE1-Silencing Transcription Factor (REST; Neuron-Restrictive Silencer Factor, NRSF) as a predicted upstream suppressor of a pro-regenerative gene program associated with axon regeneration in the CNS. We validate our predictions using multiple paradigms, showing that mature mice bearing cell type-specific deletions of REST or expressing dominant-negative mutant REST showed improved regeneration of the corticospinal tract and optic nerve, accompanied by upregulation of regeneration-associated genes in cortical motor neurons and retinal ganglion cells, respectively. These analyses identify a novel role for REST as an upstream suppressor of the intrinsic regenerative program in the CNS and demonstrate the power of a systems biology approach involving integrative genomics and bio-informatics to predict key regulators of CNS repair.",

    "abstract": "Speech comprehension relies on the ability to understand the meaning of words within a coherent context. Recent studies have attempted to obtain electrophysiological indices of this process by modelling how brain activity is affected by a words semantic dissimilarity to preceding words. While the resulting indices appear robust and are strongly modulated by attention, it remains possible that, rather than capturing the contextual understanding of words, they may actually reflect word-to-word changes in semantic content without the need for a narrative-level understanding on the part of the listener. To test this possibility, we recorded EEG from subjects who listened to speech presented in either its original, narrative form, or after scrambling the word order by varying amounts. This manipulation affected the ability of subjects to comprehend the narrative content of the speech, but not the ability to recognize the individual words. Neural indices of semantic understanding and low-level acoustic processing were derived for each scrambling condition using the temporal response function (TRF) approach. Signatures of semantic processing were observed for conditions where speech was unscrambled or minimally scrambled and subjects were able to understand the speech. The same markers were absent for higher levels of scrambling when speech comprehension dropped below chance. In contrast, word recognition remained high and neural measures related to envelope tracking did not vary significantly across the different scrambling conditions. This supports the previous claim that electrophysiological indices based on the semantic dissimilarity of words to their context reflect a listeners understanding of those words relative to that context. It also highlights the relative insensitivity of neural measures of low-level speech processing to speech comprehension.",

    "abstract": "Postsynaptic scaffold proteins immobilise neurotransmitter receptors in the synaptic membrane opposite to presynaptic vesicle release sites, thus ensuring efficient synaptic transmission. At inhibitory synapses in the spinal cord, the main scaffold protein gephyrin assembles in dense molecule clusters that provide binding sites for glycine receptors (GlyRs). Gephyrin and GlyRs can also interact outside of synapses where they form receptor-scaffold complexes. While several models for the formation of postsynaptic scaffold domains in the presence of receptor-scaffold interactions have been advanced, a clear picture of the coupled dynamics of receptors and scaffold proteins at synapses is lacking.\n\nTo characterise the GlyR and gephyrin dynamics at inhibitory synapses we performed fluorescence time-lapse imaging after photoconversion in order to directly visualise the exchange kinetics of recombinant Dendra2-gephyrin in cultured spinal cord neurons. Immuno-immobilisation of endogenous GlyRs with specific antibodies abolished their lateral diffusion in the plasma membrane, as judged by the lack of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Moreover, the crosslinking of GlyRs significantly reduced the exchange of Dendra2-gephyrin compared to control conditions, suggesting that the kinetics of the synaptic gephyrin pool is strongly dependent on GlyR-gephyrin interactions. We did not observe any change in the total synaptic gephyrin levels after GlyR crosslinking, however, indicating that the number of gephyrin molecules at synapses is not primarily dependent on the exchange of GlyR-gephyrin complexes.\n\nWe further show that our experimental data can be quantitatively accounted for by a model of receptor-scaffold dynamics that includes a tightly interacting receptor-scaffold domain, as well as more loosely bound receptor and scaffold populations that exchange with extrasynaptic pools. The model can make predictions for single molecule data such as typical dwell times of synaptic proteins. Taken together, our data demonstrate the reciprocal stabilisation of GlyRs and gephyrin at inhibitory synapses and provide a quantitative understanding of their dynamic organisation.\n\nStatement of significanceThe efficiency of signal transmission between neurons depends strongly on the number of available neurotransmitter receptors in the postsynaptic membrane. Postsynaptic scaffold proteins provide binding sites for receptors, thus setting the gain of synaptic transmission. However, the importance of receptor-scaffold interactions for the stability of the postsynaptic scaffold itself has received relatively little attention. Using time-lapse imaging of glycine receptors and gephyrin scaffolds at inhibitory synapses in spinal cord neurons together with biophysical modelling, we show that receptor mobility controls the exchange but not the total number of gephyrin molecules at the synapse, and predict that glycine receptors and gephyrin scaffolds dynamically organise into different subpopulations with varying degrees of reciprocal stabilisation.",

Analytical variables have included the number of items named, and various methods to identify and quantify clusters of semantically related words and cluster switches. Also encoded in the response sequence are temporal patterns as shown by \"bursts\" of responses and pauses between items, that have not been received attention in determining cluster characteristics.\n\nWe studied a group of 51 adult Russian-English bilinguals and compared CFT responses based on two clustering methodologies: the semantic-based method (SEM) and a novel method based on the time interval between words (TEMP) with 8 different intercall time thresholds from 0.25 sec-15 sec. Each participant performed the task in both languages. Total number of words and cluster count was greater in Russian than English for both scoring methods, but cluster size did not differ between languages. We also studied stochastic modeling characteristics based on detrending of the \"exponential exhaustion\" effect seen with CFT, with most notable that total recall capacity (N{infty}) was greater in Russian than English (P<.05). Multiple demographic variables, and recent and lifetime usage of each language, affected both cognitive performance as measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA; given in English only). Differential performance is driven by differences in demographics, more words stored in memory, and semantic and timing recall strategies.",

    "abstract": "Pathogenic mycobacteria actively dysregulate protective host immune signalling pathways during infection to drive the formation of permissive granuloma microenvironments. Dynamic regulation of host microRNA (miRNA) expression is a conserved feature of mycobacterial infections across host-pathogen pairings. Here we examine the role of miR-206 in the zebrafish model of Mycobacterium marinum infection, which allows investigation of the early stages of granuloma formation. We find miR-206 is upregulated following infection by pathogenic M. marinum and that antagomir-mediated knockdown of miR-206 is protective against infection. We observed striking upregulation of cxcl12a and cxcr4b in infected miR-206 knockdown zebrafish embryos and live imaging revealed enhanced recruitment of neutrophils to sites of infection. We used Crispr/Cas9-mediated knockdown of cxcl12a and cxcr4b expression and AMD3100 inhibition of Cxcr4 to show that the enhanced neutrophil response and reduced bacterial burden caused by miR-206 knockdown was dependent on the Cxcl12/Cxcr4 signalling axis. Together, our data illustrate a pathway through which pathogenic mycobacteria induce host miR-206 expression to suppress Cxcl12/Cxcr4 signalling and prevent protective neutrophil recruitment to granulomas.\n\nAuthor summaryMycobacterial infections cause significant disease burden to humans and animals, the most widely known example being tuberculosis which has killed more humans than any other infectious disease throughout history. Infectious mycobacteria are highly evolved to hijack host processes, including the very immune cells tasked with destroying them. microRNAs are host molecules that control wide-ranging programs of host gene expression and are important in the immune response to infections. Here we use the zebrafish model of mycobacterial infection to determine the role of the infection-induced microRNA miR-206 in the host response to infection. We found pathogenic mycobacteria trigger the host to produce more miR-206 in order to suppress the otherwise protective recruitment of neutrophils to sites of infection via the host Cxcl12/Cxcr4 signalling pathway. Our study provides new insight into the role of mycobacterial infection-induced miR-206 function in the context of a whole host.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading infectious cause of death among people living with HIV (PLHIV). PLHIV are more susceptible to contracting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection and often have worsened TB disease. Understanding the immunologic defects caused by HIV and the consequences it has on Mtb co-infection is critical in combating this global health epidemic. We previously established a model of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and Mtb co-infection in Mauritian cynomolgus macaques (MCM), and showed that SIV/Mtb co-infected MCM had rapidly progressive TB. We hypothesized that pre-existing SIV infection impairs early T cell responses to Mtb infection. To test our hypothesis, we infected MCM with SIVmac239 intrarectally followed by co-infection with a low dose of Mtb Erdman 6 months later. SIV-naive MCM were infected with Mtb alone as controls. Six weeks after Mtb infection, animals were necropsied and immune responses were measured by multiparameter flow cytometry. While the two groups exhibited similar TB progression at time of necropsy (Nx), longitudinal sampling of the blood (PBMC) and airways (BAL) revealed a significant reduction in circulating CD4+ T cells and an influx of CD8+ T cells in airways following Mtb co-infection of SIV+ animals. Differences in the activation markers CD69, PD-1, and TIGIT were observed. At sites of Mtb infection (i.e. granulomas), SIV/Mtb co-infected animals had a higher proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing PD-1 and TIGIT. In addition, there were fewer TNF-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in granulomas and airways of SIV/Mtb co-infected animals. Taken together, we show that concurrent SIV infection alters T cell phenotypes in granulomas during the early stages of TB disease. As it is critical to establish control of Mtb replication soon after infection, these phenotypic changes may distinguish the immune dysfunction that arises from pre-existing SIV infection which promotes TB progression.\n\nAuthor SummaryPeople living with HIV are incredibly susceptible to TB and, when co-infected with Mtb, often develop serious TB disease. We do not yet understand precisely how HIV infection impairs the early stages of the adaptive immune response against Mtb bacilli. We employed a non-human primate model of HIV, using SIV as a surrogate for HIV, followed by Mtb co-infection to investigate the immunologic defects associated with pre-existing SIV infection over the first six weeks of Mtb co-infection. Our study focused on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as these cells are known to play an important role in Mtb control. We found more CD8+ T cells in granulomas, the sites of Mtb infection, from SIV/Mtb co-infected animals, with little difference in CD4+ T cells. SIV/Mtb co-infected animals and animals infected with SIV alone had a higher proportion of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing activation markers compared to SIV-naive animals, consistent with SIV-dependent immune activation. Notably, we observed a lower proportion of TNF-producing T cells, a cytokine critical for Mtb control, in granulomas and airways of SIV/Mtb co-infected animals. Taken together, these data show that pre-existing SIV alters T cell phenotypes and reduces TNF responses early in Mtb infection.",

    "abstract": "Helicobacter pylori is an important bacterial pathogen that causes chronic infection of the human stomach, leading to gastritis, peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics can eliminate H. pylori infection and reduce the risk for severe disease outcomes. However, since H. pylori is becoming increasingly resistant to standard antibiotic regimens, novel treatment strategies are needed. Previous studies have demonstrated that black and red berries may have antibacterial properties. Therefore, we analyzed organic extracts and powders from black and red raspberries and blackberries and determined their antibacterial effects on multiple H. pylori strains. We used high-performance liquid chromatography to measure berry anthocyanins, which are considered the major active ingredients. To monitor antibiotic effects of the berry preparations on H. pylori, we developed a high-throughput metabolic growth assay based on the OmniLog system. All berry preparations tested had significant bactericidal effects in vitro, with MIC90 values ranging from 0.49 to 4.17%. We next used human gastric epithelial organoids to evaluate biocompatibility of the berry preparations and showed that black raspberry extract, which had the strongest antimicrobial activity, was non-toxic at the concentration required for complete bacterial growth inhibition. To determine whether dietary black raspberry application could eliminate H. pylori infection in vivo, mice were infected with H. pylori and then were placed on a diet containing 10% black raspberry powder. However, this treatment did not significantly impact bacterial infection rates or gastric pathology. In summary, our data indicate that black and red raspberry and blackberry products have potential applications in the treatment and prevention of H. pylori infection, because of their antibacterial effects and good biocompatibility. However, delivery and formulation of berry compounds needs to be optimized to achieve significant antibacterial effects in vivo.",

We incubated S. trochoidea in modified f/2 media in flasks which were divided into five groups and treated with different Ca2+ concentrations (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 g{middle dot}L-1). We revealed that cell density increased with increasing Ca2+ concentrations; however, cell density was reduced when Ca2+ concentrations exceeded 0.2 g{middle dot}mL-1. Additionally, the number of cysts and the cyst formation rate similarly increased as Ca2+ concentrations increased, but these were reduced when Ca2+ concentrations exceeded 0.4 g{middle dot}mL-1. Lastly, S. trochoidea absorbed Ca2+ from the water when cysts were formed and under high Ca2+ concentrations, more calcareous thorn cysts formed.",

    "abstract": "Two modes of positive selection have been recognized: 1) hard sweeps that result in the rapid fixation of a beneficial allele typically from a de novo mutation and 2) soft sweeps that are characterized by intermediate frequencies of at least two haplotypes that stem from standing genetic variation or recurrent de novo mutations. While many populations exhibit both hard and soft sweeps throughout the genome, there is increasing evidence that soft sweeps, rather than hard sweeps, are the predominant mode of adaptation in many species, including humans. Here, we use a supervised machine learning approach to assess the extent of completed hard and soft sweeps in the closest living relatives of humans: bonobos and chimpanzees (genus Pan). We trained convolutional neural network classifiers using simulated data and applied these classifiers to population genomic data for 71 individuals representing all five extant Pan lineages, of which we successfully analyzed 60 individuals from four lineages. We found that recent adaptation in Pan is largely the result of soft sweeps, ranging from 73.1 to 97.7% of all identified sweeps. While few hard sweeps were shared among lineages, we found that between 19 and 267 soft sweep windows were shared by at least two lineages. We also identify novel candidate genes subject to recent positive selection. This study emphasizes the importance of shifts in the physical and social environment, rather than novel mutation, in shaping recent adaptations in bonobos and chimpanzees.",

With recent advances in machine learning and embedded computing, much more nuanced and accurate behavior classification has become possible, giving these affordable consumer devices the potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of pet healthcare. Here we describe a novel deep learning algorithm that classifies dog behavior at sub-second resolution using commercial pet activity monitors. We built machine learning training databases from over 5,000 videos of over 2,500 dogs and ran the algorithms in production on over 11 million days of device data. We then surveyed project participants representing 10,550 dogs, they provided us 163,110 event responses to validate real-world detection of eating and drinking behavior. The resultant algorithm displayed a sensitivity and specificity for detecting drinking behavior (0.949 and 0.999, respectively) and eating behavior (0.988, 0.983). We also demonstrated detection of licking, petting, rubbing, scratching, and sniffing. We show that the devices position on the collar has no measurable impact on performance. In production, users reported a true positive rate of 95.3% for eating (among 1,514 users), and of 94.9% (among 1,491 users) for drinking. The study demonstrates the accurate detection of important health-related canine behaviors using a collar-mounted accelerometer. We trained and validated our algorithms on a large and realistic training dataset, and we assessed and confirmed accuracy in production via user validation.",

In the present study, we evaluatedthe natural history of L. braziliensis infection from its first stagesup to lesion establishment, with the aim ofidentifyingimmunological parameters associated with the disease outcome and parasitismfate. To this end, hamsters infected with 104, 105,or 106 promastigoteswere monitored duringthe first hours (4h, 24h), early (15, 30 days) and late (50 days) post-infection (pi) phases. Cytokines, iNOS and arginasegene expression were quantified in the established lesions by RT-PCR. Compared to the 105 or 106 groups, 104animals presented lower lesions sizes, less tissue damage,and lower IgG levels. Basal gene expression in normal skin was high for TGF-{beta}, and intermediary for TNF, IL-6, and IL-4.At 4hpi, no cytokine induction was observed in the 104 group, while an upregulation of IL-6, IL-10, and IL-4 was observed in the 106 group. At 15dpi, lesion appearance was accompanied byan increasedexpression of all assessed cytokines, markedly in the 105 and 106 groups. Upregulation of all investigated cytokines was observed in the late phase, although less expressive in the 104 group. IFN-{gamma} was the depending variable influencing tissue damage, while IL-6 was associatedto parasite load. The network correlating gene expression and clinical and laboratorial parameters indicated inoculum-independent associations at 15 and 30dpi.A strong positive network correlation was observed in the 104 group, but not in the105 or 106 groups. In conclusion, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and TGF-{beta} are linkedto L. braziliensisprogression. However, a balanced cytokine network is the key for an immune response able to reduce the ongoing infection and reduce pathological damage.",

    "abstract": "Early embryogenesis requires the coordinated development of cardiovascular and hematopoietic lineages. However, the underlying cellular and genetic mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that Rnf2, the core enzymatic component of Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), plays an important role in the control of cardiovascular and hematopoietic development and differentiation via suppressing the master hematoendothelial progenitor genes in zebrafish. In the absence of Rnf2, a group of transcription factor (TF) genes crucial for hematoendothelial specification such as etv2, gata2, lmo2 and tal1 are significantly up-regulated, which causes an expansion of hematopoietic and endothelial progenitors at the expense of myocardial differentiation, resulting in severe defects in both cardiogenesis and hematopoiesis. Although the number of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is increased, both primitive and definitive waves of hematopoiesis are severely compromised in rnf2 mutant embryos, suggesting that Rnf2 is required for differentiation of blood progenitor cells. Combined ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analysis shows that Rnf2 directly binds to key hematoendothelial progenitor genes and represses its expression. We further show that Rnf2-mediated gene repression depends on its H2Aub1 catalytic activity. We propose that PRC1/Rnf2-mediated epigenetic mechanism plays a key role in coordinated development of cardiovascular and hematopoietic lineages by repressing key hematoendothelial progenitor genes.\n\nHighlightsO_LIRnf2 is required for suppressing the expression of key hematoendothelial TF genes in precursors and its differentiated descendants.\nC_LIO_LIRnf2 mutant zebrafish embryos display defective hematopoiesis and cardiogenesis.\nC_LIO_LILoss of Rnf2 results in increased HSC numbers and arrested differentiation, hallmarks of leukemia.\nC_LIO_LIRnf2 suppresses hematoendothelial progenitor genes via depositing H2Aub1.\nC_LI",

Mononuclear cells were cultured for 6 days in the expansion medium. The cells were divided into four groups; group 1 (P1), which was not exposed to small molecules (control group) and groups 2-4 (P2-P4), the experimental groups, subjected to various dosages of the small molecule compound VC6TFZ (VPA, CHIR, Tranylcypromine, FSK, Dznep, and TTNPB). The induction of pluripotency using small molecule compound VC6TFZ was completed within 14 days, then for 7 days the medium shifted to 2i medium. iPSCs identification in based on colony morphology and pluripotent gene expression, SSEA4 and TRA1-60 marker, using immunocytochemistry.\n\nResultsColonies appeared on reprogramming process in day 7th. These colonies had round, large, and cobble stone morphology like ESC. Gene expression of SSEA4 and TRA 1-60 increased statisticaly significant than control group (SSEA4 were P2 p=0.007; P3 p=0.001; P4 p=0.009 and TRA 1-60 were P2 p=0.002; P3 p=0.001; P4 p=0.001).\n\nConclusionSmall molecule compound VC6TFZ could induced pluripotency of human PBMC to generate iPSCs. Pluripotxency marker gene expression, SSEA 4 and TRA 1-60, in the experimental group was statistically significantly higher than in the control group.",

    "abstract": "Aims/hypothesisInsulin sensitizers and incretin mimetics are antidiabetic agents with vastly different mechanisms of action. Additionally, while thiazolidinedione (TZD) insulin sensitizers are associated with the side-effect of weight gain, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) can induce weight loss. We hypothesized that combination therapy with a novel TZD insulin sensitizer and the GLP-1RA Liraglutide would more significantly improve mouse models of diabetes and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) compared to individual therapy.\n\nMethodsdb/db mice were treated with the novel TZD MSDC-0602K by oral gavage, Liraglutide (Lira) by s.c. injection, combination 0602K+Lira, or both vehicle solutions. Vehicle-treated db/+ mice were included as non-obese controls. To assess treatment effects on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, MS-NASH mice were similarly treated with vehicle, either drug individually, or in combination. Lastly, islets were isolated from C57BL/6J mice to assess glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS).\n\nResults0602K-treated db/db mice displayed slight weight gain but completely corrected glycemia and markedly improved glucose tolerance. Lira slightly reduced body weights and modestly improved glycemia. 0602K+Lira combination still induced slight weight gain but completely corrected glycemia and improved glucose tolerance beyond lean db/+ levels. As expected, 0602K resulted in reduced plasma insulin, whereas Lira further increased the hyperinsulinemia of db/db mice. Surprisingly, 0602K+Lira treatment reduced plasma insulin and C-peptide to the same extent as mice treated with 0602K alone. 0602K did not directly reduce GSIS in isolated islets, thus the reduced insulinemia with 0602K is likely compensatory due to improved insulin action. In the MS-NASH mouse model, both 0602K or Lira alone improved plasma ALT and AST, and liver histology, but more significant improvements were observed with 0602K+Lira combination therapy. 0602K or 0602K+Lira also increased pancreatic insulin content in both db/db and MS-NASH mice.\n\nConclusionsMSDC-0602K corrected glycemia and reduced insulinemia when given alone, or in combination with Lira. However, 0602K+Lira combination more significantly improved glucose tolerance in db/db mice, and more significantly improved liver histology in MS-NASH mice.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria synthesize guanosine tetra- and penta phosphate (commonly referred to as (p)ppGpp) in response to environmental stresses. (p)ppGpp reprograms cell physiology and is essential for stress survival, virulence and antibiotic tolerance. Proteins of the RSH superfamily (RelA/SpoT Homologues) are ubiquitously distributed and hydrolyze or synthesize (p)ppGpp. Structural studies have suggested that the shift between hydrolysis and synthesis is governed by conformational antagonism between the two active sites in RSHs. RelA proteins of {gamma}-proteobacteria exclusively synthesize (p)ppGpp and encode an inactive pseudo-hydrolase domain. Escherichia coli RelA synthesizes (p)ppGpp in response to amino acid starvation with cognate uncharged tRNA at the ribosomal A-site, however, mechanistic details to the regulation of the enzymatic activity remain elusive. Here, we show a role of the enzymatically inactive hydrolase domain in modulating the activity of the synthetase domain of RelA. Using mutagenesis screening and functional studies, we identify a loop region (residues 114-130) in the hydrolase domain, which controls the synthetase activity. We show that a synthetase-inactive loop mutant of RelA is not affected for tRNA binding, but binds the ribosome less efficiently than wildtype RelA. Our data support the model that the hydrolase domain acts as a molecular switch to regulate the synthetase activity.",

    "abstract": "Brain implants are increasingly used to treat neurological disorders and diseases. However, the brain foreign body response (FBR) elicited by implants affects neuro-electrical transduction and long-term reliability limiting their clinical adoption. The mismatch in Youngs modulus between silicon implants ([~]180 GPa) and brain tissue ([~]1-30 kPa) exacerbates the FBR resulting in the development of flexible implants from polymers such as polyimide ([~]1.5-2.5 GPa). However, a stiffness mismatch of at least two orders of magnitude remains. Here, we introduce (i) the first mechanically matched brain implant (MMBI) made from silicone ([~]20 kPa), (ii) new microfabrication methods, and (iii) a novel dissolvable sugar shuttle to reliably implant MMBIs. MMBIs were fabricated via vacuum-assisted molding using sacrificial sugar molds and were then encased in sugar shuttles that dissolved within 2 min after insertion into rat brains. Sections of rat neocortex implanted with MMBIs, PDMS implants, and silicon implants were analyzed by immunohistochemistry 3 and 9-weeks post-implantation. MMBIs resulted in significantly higher neuronal density and lower FBR within 50 {micro}m of the tissue-implant interface compared to PDMS and silicon implants suggesting that materials mechanically matched to brain further minimize the FBR and could contribute to better implant functionality and long-term reliability.",
