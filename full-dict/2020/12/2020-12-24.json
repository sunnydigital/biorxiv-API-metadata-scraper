    "abstract": "The changing forest disturbance regimes emphasize the need for improved damage risk information. Here, our aim was to (1) improve the current understanding of snow damage risks by assessing the importance of abiotic factors, particularly the modelled snow load on trees, versus forest properties in predicting the probability of snow damage, (2) produce a snow damage probability map for Finland. We also compared the results for winters with typical snow load conditions and a winter with exceptionally heavy snow loads. To do this, we used damage observations from the Finnish national forest inventory (NFI) to create a statistical snow damage occurrence model, spatial data layers from different sources to use the model to predict the damage probability for the whole country in 16 x 16 m resolution. Snow damage reports from forest owners were used for testing the final map. Our results showed that best results were obtained when both abiotic and forest variables were included in the model. However, in the case of the high snow load winter, the model with only abiotic predictors performed nearly as well as the full model and the ability of the models to identify the snow damaged stands was higher than in other years. The results showed patterns of forest adaptation to high snow loads, as spruce stands in the north were less susceptible to damage than in southern areas and long-term snow load reduced the damage probability. The model and the derived wall-to-wall map were able to discriminate damage from no-damage cases on a good level. The damage probability mapping approach identifies the drivers of snow disturbances across forest landscapes and can be used to spatially estimate the current and future disturbance risks in forests, informing practical forestry and decision-making and supporting the adaptation to the changing disturbance regimes.",

However, all sequenced genomes to date contain gaps and missing sequences. Here, we report, for the first time, the assembly and analyses of two gap-free reference genome sequences of the elite O. sativa xian/indica rice varieties  Zhenshan 97 (ZS97) and  Minghui 63 (MH63) that are being used as a model system to study heterosis. Gap-free reference genomes also provide global insights into the structure and function of centromeres. All rice centromeric regions share conserved centromere-specific satellite motifs but with different copy numbers and structures. Importantly, we demonstrate that >1,500 genes are located in centromere regions, of which ~15.6% are actively transcribed. The generation and release of both the ZS97 and MH63 gap-free genomes lays a solid foundation for the comprehensive study of genome structure and function in plants and breed climate resilient varieties for the 21st century.",

    "abstract": "Thailand and Laos, located in the center of Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA), harbor diverse ethnolinguistic groups encompassing all five language families of MSEA: Tai-Kadai (TK), Austroasiatic (AA), Sino-Tibetan (ST), Hmong-Mien (HM) and Austronesian (AN). Previous genetic studies of Thai/Lao populations have focused almost exclusively on uniparental markers and there is a paucity of genome-wide studies. We therefore generated genome-wide SNP data for 33 ethnolinguistic groups, belonging to the five MSEA language families from Thailand and Laos, and analysed these together with data from modern Asian populations and SEA ancient samples. Overall, we find genetic structure according to language family, albeit with heterogeneity in the AA-, HM- and ST-speaking groups, and in the hill tribes, that reflects both population interactions and genetic drift. For the TK speaking groups, we find localized genetic structure that is driven by different levels of interaction with other groups in the same geographic region. Several Thai groups exhibit admixture from South Asia, which we date to [~]600-1000 years ago, corresponding to a time of intensive international trade networks that had a major cultural impact on Thailand. An AN group from Southern Thailand shows both South Asian admixture as well as overall affinities with AA-speaking groups in the region, suggesting an impact of cultural diffusion. Overall, we provide the first detailed insights into the genetic profiles of Thai/Lao ethnolinguistic groups, which should be helpful for reconstructing human genetic history in MSEA and selecting populations for participation in ongoing whole genome sequence and biomedical studies.",

However, a majority of genomic variation studies have focused on single-nucleotide variations (SNVs), with limited genome-wide analysis of CNVs in large cohorts, especially in populations that are under-represented in genetic studies including people of African descent.\n\nResultsIn this study, we carried out a genome-wide analysis in > 3400 healthy Bantu Africans from Tanzania using high density (> 2.5 million probes) genotyping arrays. We identified over 400000 CNVs larger than 1 kilobase (kb), for an average of 120 CNVs (SE = 2.57) per individual. We detected 866 large CNVs ([&ge;] 300 kb), some of which overlapped genomic regions previously associated with multiple congenital anomaly syndromes, including Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome (Type1) and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Furthermore, several of the common CNVs seen in our cohort ([&ge;] 5%) overlap genes previously associated with developmental disorders.\n\nConclusionThese findings may help refine the phenotypic outcomes and penetrance of variations affecting genes and genomic regions previously implicated in diseases. Our study provides one of the largest datasets of CNVs from individuals of African ancestry, enabling improved clinical evaluation and disease association of CNVs observed in research and clinical studies in African populations.",

N-terminal acetyltransferase D (NatD) is one of the most specific NAT with only histone H4 and H2A proteins as the known substrates. Dysregulation of NatD has been implicated in colorectal and lung cancer progression, implying its therapeutic potential in cancers. However, there is no reported inhibitor for NatD yet. To facilitate the discovery of small-molecule NatD inhibitors, we report the development of a fluorescence-based acetyltransferase assay in 384-well high-throughput screening (HTS) format through monitoring the formation of coenzyme A. The fluorescent signal is generated from the adduct in the reaction between coenzyme A and fluorescent probe ThioGlo4. The assay exhibited a Z-factor of 0.77 and a coefficient of variation of 6%, indicating it is a robust assay for HTS. A pilot screen of 1280 pharmacologically active compounds and subsequent validation identified two hits, confirming the application of this fluorescence assay in HTS.",

    "abstract": "The majority of microbial genomes have yet to be cultured, and most proteins predicted from microbial genomes or sequenced from the environment cannot be functionally annotated. As a result, current computational approaches to describe microbial systems rely on incomplete reference databases that cannot adequately capture the full functional diversity of the microbial tree of life, limiting our ability to model high-level features of biological sequences. The scientific community needs a means to capture the functionally and evolutionarily relevant features underlying biology, independent of our incomplete reference databases. Such a model can form the basis for transfer learning tasks, enabling downstream applications in environmental microbiology, medicine, and bioengineering. Here we present LookingGlass, a deep learning model capturing a \"universal language of life\". LookingGlass encodes contextually-aware, functionally and evolutionarily relevant representations of short DNA reads, distinguishing reads of disparate function, homology, and environmental origin. We demonstrate the ability of LookingGlass to be fine-tuned to perform a range of diverse tasks: to identify novel oxidoreductases, to predict enzyme optimal temperature, and to recognize the reading frames of DNA sequence fragments. LookingGlass is the first contextually-aware, general purpose pre-trained \"biological language\" representation model for short-read DNA sequences. LookingGlass enables functionally relevant representations of otherwise unknown and unannotated sequences, shedding light on the microbial dark matter that dominates life on Earth.\n\nAvailabilityThe pretrained LookingGlass model and the transfer learning-derived models demonstrated in this paper are available in the LookingGlass release v1.01. The open source fastBio Github repository and python package provides classes and functions for training and fine tuning deep learning models with biological data2.

    "abstract": "Uncovering signaling links or cascades among proteins that potentially regulate tumor development and drug response is one of the most critical and challenging tasks in cancer molecular biology. Inhibition of the targets on the core signaling cascades can be effective as novel cancer treatment regimens. However, signaling cascades inference remains an open problem, and there is a lack of effective computational models. The widely used gene co-expression network (no-direct signaling cascades) and shortest-path based protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis (with too many interactions, and did not consider the sparsity of signaling cascades) were not specifically designed to predict the direct and sparse signaling cascades. To resolve the challenges, we proposed a novel deep learning model, deepSignalingLinkNet, to predict signaling cascades by integrating transcriptomics data and copy number data of a large set of cancer samples with the protein-protein interactions (PPIs) via a novel deep graph neural network model. Different from the existing models, the proposed deep learning model was trained using the curated KEGG signaling pathways to identify the informative omics and PPI topology features in the data-driven manner to predict the potential signaling cascades. The validation results indicated the feasibility of signaling cascade prediction using the proposed deep learning models. Moreover, the trained model can potentially predict the signaling cascades among the new proteins by transferring the learned patterns on the curated signaling pathways.

    "abstract": "A cell uses its cytoskeletal machinery to control its membrane projections to seek and obtain cargo from its microenvironment. Though this process has been studied extensively using spherical cargo, it remains largely unknown how the process operates with vectorial ones, which are non-spheroid rigid objects with an aspect ratio. In this study, a vectorial cargo, silicon nanowire, was observed to have multiple modes of initial contact and to realign along a membrane projection or on a lamella. Using a qualitative theoretical approach, we demonstrate how membrane energy fluctuations potentially drive this realignment of a vectorial cargo. This was understood by calculations which establish how aspect ratio controls the energy landscape in a vectorial object and its influence on relative energy stability of nanowire-membrane contacts. A study of the realignment transport of vectorial cargoes and their comparison with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process simulations revealed how one-dimensional time-correlated noise manifested in the transport process. Furthermore, a comparison between sliding of nanowires on cell membrane contacts versus rotational realignment with the same model revealed identical characteristics behind both. The understanding that one-dimensional time-correlated noise underlies both sliding and rotation of a vectorial cargo establishes how cytoskeletal dynamics effectively couples their realignment with subsequent transport for phagocytosis. This work establishes the significance of vectorial cargoes and the nature of underlying vectorial processes that enable their cellular processing.",

However, this is limited by its dependency on the assay duration and lack of reflections regarding actual cellular response phenotypes. To resolve these limitations, we considered contribution of each response phenotype upon a drug treatment to the overall growth behavior.\n\nExperimental ApproachThe differential equation of phenotype population dynamics was solved analytically without numerical computation. By using the properly figured population dynamics, we explored how the conventional assessment method itself affects the assessment result of drug response, in the context of drug screening. Alternative phenotype metric was compared with the conventional metrics through evaluation of the publicly available drug response data.\n\nKey ResultsThe conventional assessment showed several limitations in the comparative analysis of drug response: a significant time-dependency, and ambiguities in assessment results based on a dose-response curve. Instead, the alternative phenotype metrics provide time-independent phenotype rates of change, that contain all the information of the drug response at a given dose, and better classification including the mechanism underlying growth inhibition.\n\nConclusion and ImplicationsThe conventional dose-response curve is useful for a visual presentation of overall drug responses upon a certain molecular feature qualitatively.

    "abstract": "In photosynthetic organisms, it is recognized that the intracellular NADP+/NADPH ratio is regulated within an appropriate range for the cooperative function of a wide variety of physiological processes. However, despite its importance, there is large variability in the values of the NADP+/NADPH ratio quantitatively estimated to date. In the present study, the light-response of the NADP+/NADPH ratio was investigated by applying a novel NADP(H) extraction method using phenol / chloroform / isoamyl alcohol (PCI) in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The light-response of NADP(H) observed using PCI extraction was qualitatively consistent with the NADPH fluorescence time course measured in vivo. Moreover, the results obtained by PCI extraction and the fluorescence-based methods were also consistent in a mutant lacking the ability to oxidize NAD(P)H in the respiratory chain, and exhibiting a unique NADPH light-response. These observations indicate that the PCI extraction method allowed quantitative determination of NADP(H) redox. Notably, the PCI extraction method showed that not all NADP(H) was oxidized or reduced by light-dark transition, indicating that some NADP(H) is not light-responsive. Specifically, 64% of total NADP(H) was observed as non-light-responsive in the wild-type cells. The variation of the intracellular NADP+/NADPH ratio is limited to a narrow range due to the presence of non-light-responsive NADP(H).",

We used recent advances in using functional connectivity to map the flow of activity between brain regions to construct a task-performing neural network model from fMRI data during a cognitive control task. We verified the importance of conjunction hubs in cognitive computations by simulating neural activity flow over this empirically-estimated functional connectivity model. These empirically-specified simulations produced above-chance task performance (motor responses) by integrating sensory and task rule activations in conjunction hubs.

    "abstract": "The genus Aspergillus encompasses human pathogens such as Aspergillus fumigatus and industrial powerhouses such as Aspergillus niger. In both cases, Aspergillus biofilms have consequences for infection outcomes and yields of economically important products. Yet, the molecular components influencing filamentous fungal biofilm development, structure, and function remain ill-defined. Macroscopic colony morphology is an indicator of underlying biofilm architecture and fungal physiology. A hypoxia-locked colony morphotype of A. fumigatus has abundant colony furrows that coincide with a reduction in vertically-oriented hyphae within biofilms and increased low oxygen growth and virulence. Investigation of this morphotype has led to the identification of the causative gene, biofilm architecture factor A (bafA), a small cryptic open reading frame within a subtelomeric gene cluster. BafA is sufficient to induce the hypoxia-locked colony morphology and biofilm architecture in A. fumigatus. Analysis across a large population of A. fumigatus isolates identified a larger family of baf genes, all of which have the capacity to modulate hyphal architecture, biofilm development, and hypoxic growth. Furthermore, introduction of A. fumigatus bafA into A. niger is sufficient to generate the hypoxia-locked colony morphology, biofilm architecture, and increased hypoxic growth. Together these data indicate the potential broad impacts of this previously uncharacterized family of small genes to modulate biofilm architecture and function in clinical and industrial settings.\n\nImportanceThe manipulation of microbial biofilms in industrial and clinical applications remains a difficult task. The problem is particularly acute with regard to filamentous fungal biofilms for which molecular mechanisms of biofilm formation, maintenance, and function are only just being elucidated. Here we describe a family of small genes heterogeneously expressed across Aspergillus fumigatus strains that are capable of modifying colony biofilm morphology and microscopic hyphal architecture. Specifically, these genes are implicated in the formation of a hypoxia-locked colony morphotype that is associated with increased virulence of A. fumigatus. Synthetic introduction of these gene family members, here referred to as biofilm architecture factors, in both A. fumigatus and A. niger additionally modulates low oxygen growth and surface adherence. Thus, these genes are candidates for genetic manipulation of biofilm development in Aspergilli.",

    "abstract": "Catheter-associated urinary tract infections have serious consequences, both for patients and in impacting on healthcare resources. Much work has been carried out to develop an antimicrobial catheter. Although such developments have shown promise under laboratory conditions, none have demonstrated a clear advantage in clinical trials.\n\nUsing a range of microbiological and advanced microscopy techniques, a detailed laboratory study comparing biofilm development on silicone, hydrogel latex and silver alloy coated hydrogel latex catheters was carried out. Biofilm development by Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis on three commercially available catheters was tracked over time. Samples were examined with episcopic differential interference contrast (EDIC) microscopy, culture analysis and staining techniques to quantify viable but non-culturable (VBNC) bacteria.\n\nBoth qualitative and quantitative assessment found biofilms to develop rapidly on all three materials. EDIC microscopy revealed the rough surface topography of the materials. Differences between culture counts and quantification of total and dead cells demonstrated the presence of VBNC populations, where bacteria retain viability but are not metabolically active.\n\nThe use of non-culture based techniques showed the development of widespread VBNC populations. These VBNC populations were more evident on silver alloy coated hydrogel latex catheters, indicating a bacteriostatic effect at best. The laboratory tests reported here, that detect VBNC bacteria, allow more rigorous assessment of antimicrobial catheters offering an explanation for why there is often minimal benefit to patients.\n\nIMPORTANCESeveral antimicrobial urinary catheter materials have been developed but, although laboratory studies may show a benefit, none have significantly improved clinical outcomes. The use of poorly designed laboratory testing and lack of consideration to the impact of VBNC populations may be responsible. While the presence of VBNC populations is becoming more widely reported, there remains a lack of understanding of the clinical impact or influence of exposure to antimicrobial products. This is the first study to investigate the impact of antimicrobial surface materials and the appearance of VBNC populations. This demonstrates how improved testing is needed prior to clinical trials uptake.",

    "abstract": "CLN5 is a soluble endolysosomal protein whose function is poorly understood. Mutations in this protein cause a rare neurodegenerative disease, Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis. We previously found that depletion of CLN5 leads to dysfunctional retromer, resulting in the degradation of the lysosomal sorting receptor, sortilin. However, how a soluble lysosomal protein can modulate the function of a cytosolic protein, retromer, is not known. In this work, we show that deletion of CLN5 not only results in retromer dysfunction, but also in impaired endolysosome fusion events. This results in delayed degradation of endocytic proteins and in defective autophagy. CLN5 modulates these various pathways by regulating downstream interactions between CLN3, an endolysosomal integral membrane protein whose mutations also result in Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis, Rab7A, and a subset of Rab7A effectors. Our data supports a model where CLN3 and CLN5 function as an endolysosome complex regulating various functions.\n\nSummary StatementWe have previously demonstrated that CLN3 is required for efficient endosome-to-trans Golgi Network (TGN) trafficking of sortilin by regulating retromer function. In this work, we show that CLN5, which interacts with CLN3, regulates retromer function by modulating key interactions between CLN3, Rab7A, retromer, and sortilin. Therefore, CLN3 and CLN5 serve as endosomal switch regulating the itinerary of the lysosomal sorting receptors.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how organisms adapt to aquatic life at high altitude is fundamental in evolutionary biology. This objective has been addressed primarily related to hypoxia adaptation by recent comparative studies, whereas highland fish has also long suffered extreme alkaline environment, insight into the genomic basis of alkaline adaptation has rarely been provided. Here, we compared the genomes or transcriptomes of 15 fish species, including two alkaline tolerant highland fish species and their six alkaline intolerant relatives, three alkaline tolerant lowland fish species and four alkaline intolerant species. We found putatively consistent patterns of molecular evolution in alkaline tolerant species in a large number of shared orthologs within highland and lowland fish taxa. Remarkably, we identified consistent signatures of accelerated evolution and positive selection in a set of shared genes associated with ion transport, apoptosis, immune response and energy metabolisms in alkaline tolerant species within both highland and lowland fish taxa. This is one of the first comparative studies that began to elucidate the consistent genomic signature of alkaline adaptation shared by highland and lowland fish. This finding also highlights the adaptive molecular evolution changes that support fish adapting to extreme environments at high altitude.\n\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how wild fish responds to extreme alkaline stress besides hypoxia at high altitude. Comparative genomics has begun to elucidate the genomic basis of alkaline adaptation in lowland fish, such as killifish, but insight from highland fish has lagged behind. The common role of adaptive molecular evolution during alkaline adaptation in highland and lowland fish has rarely been discussed. We address this question by comparing 15 fish omics data. We find numbers of shared orthologs exhibited consistent patterns of molecular evolution in alkaline tolerant species relative to intolerant species. We further identify remarkably consistent signatures of rapidly evolving and positive selection in a substantial shared core of genes in both highland and lowland alkaline tolerant species.",

    "abstract": "The search for molecular species that are differentially expressed between biological states is an important step towards discovering promising biomarker candidates. In imaging mass spectrometry (IMS), performing this search manually is often impractical due to the large size and high-dimensionality of IMS datasets. Instead, we propose an interpretable machine learning workflow that automatically identifies biomarker candidates by their mass-to-charge ratios, and that quantitatively estimates their relevance to recognizing a given biological class using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP). The task of biomarker candidate discovery is translated into a feature ranking problem: given a classification model that assigns pixels to different biological classes on the basis of their mass spectra, the molecular species that the model uses as features are ranked in descending order of relative predictive importance such that the top-ranking features have a higher likelihood of being useful biomarkers. Besides providing the user with an experiment-wide measure of a molecular species biomarker potential, our workflow delivers spatially localized explanations of the classification models decision-making process in the form of a novel representation called SHAP maps. SHAP maps deliver insight into the spatial specificity of biomarker candidates by highlighting in which regions of the tissue sample each feature provides discriminative information and in which regions it does not. SHAP maps also enable one to determine whether the relationship between a biomarker candidate and a biological state of interest is correlative or anticorrelative. Our automated approach to estimating a molecular species potential for characterizing a user-provided biological class, combined with the untargeted and multiplexed nature of IMS, allows for the rapid screening of thousands of molecular species and the obtention of a broader biomarker candidate shortlist than would be possible through targeted manual assessment. Our biomarker candidate discovery workflow is demonstrated on mouse-pup and rat kidney case studies.\n\nHighlightsO_LIOur workflow automates the discovery of biomarker candidates in imaging mass spectrometry data by using state-of-the-art machine learning methodology to produce a shortlist of molecular species that are differentially expressed with regards to a user-provided biological class.\nC_LIO_LIA model interpretability method called Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), with observational Shapley values, enables us to quantify the local and global predictive importance of molecular species with respect to recognizing a user-provided biological class.\nC_LIO_LIBy providing spatially localized explanations for a classification models decision-making process, SHAP maps deliver insight into the spatial specificity of biomarker candidates and enable one to determine whether (and where) the relationship between a biomarker candidate and the class of interest is correlative or anticorrelative.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "In type 2 diabetes (T2D), both muscle and liver are severely resistant to insulin action. Muscle insulin resistance accounts for more than 80% of the impairment in total body glucose disposal in T2D patients and is often characterized by an impaired insulin signaling. Mitsugumin 53 (MG53), a muscle-specific TRIM family protein initially identified as a key regulator of cell membrane repair machinery has been suggested to be a critical regulator of muscle insulin signaling pathway by acting as ubiquitin E3 ligase targeting both the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1). Here, we show using in vitro and in vivo approaches that MG53 is not a critical regulator of insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis. First, MG53 expression is not consistently regulated in skeletal muscle from various preclinical models of insulin resistance. Second, MG53 gene knock-down in muscle cells does not lead to impaired insulin response as measured by Akt phosphorylation on Serine 473 and glucose uptake. Third, recombinant human MG53 does not alter insulin response in both differentiated C2C12 and human skeletal muscle cells. Fourth, ectopic expression of MG53 in HEK293 cells lacking endogenous MG53 expression fails to alter insulin response as measured by Akt phosphorylation. Finally, both male and female mg53 -/- mice were not resistant to high fat induced obesity and glucose intolerance compared to wild-type mice. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that MG53 is not a critical regulator of insulin signaling pathway in skeletal muscle.",

    "abstract": "Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) are a group of Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) which bind to the exogenous pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) like other PRRs; hence the main function is to sense the harmness and mediate the innate immune response to pathogens. TLRs play an important role in innate immune responses to infection. The host has evolved to use other TLR and PAMP agonists as agents to stimulate a protective inflammatory immune response against infection. Because only a small number of doses are given, TLR agonists appear to have greater potential and fewer safety concerns than other uses as vaccine adjuvants. In the present days, development of peptides targeting immune response can be approved for survival in biological monitoring systems before vaccine exposures. Peptide vaccines are easy to synthesize, more stable and relatively safe. In addition, production of peptides becomes simple, easily reproducible, fast and cost effective. Getting vaccinated against Covid-19, which has become a pandemic in the human population, is the most practical way to control the outbreak. The new coronavirus does not contain a drug or vaccine to prevent it from spreading to humans. To getting a proper vaccine candidate against the novel coronavirus, the present study used the reverse vaccinology approach by using a complete set of SARS-CoV-2 proteins; such as: Spike, Envelope, Nucleocapsid, Membrane, NSPs, and ORFs to extract the antigenic elements that produce B-cell, T-cell and IFN positive epitopes. These epitopes with precise binding to the Toll-Like receptors (1-10) have developed epitope based vaccine candidates. We have prioritized a set of epitopes based on their antigenicity, allergenicity, sequence conservation and projected population coverage world-wide. The selected epitopes were employed for in-silico docking interactions with Toll-Like receptors and molecular dynamic simulation confirmed the stability of the vaccine candidates resulting epitope of spike proteins with both the TLR 7 and 8 shows the best binding affinity. We believe that this ideal epitope vaccine candidate could enhance the immune response of the host and reduce the reinfection risk.",

We aimed to identify whether the patient population presenting with fragility fractures is receiving prophylactic treatment for osteoporosis within a single academic hospital in the southernmost region of the United States. This region is characterized by a high number of patients from Hispanic/Latino heritage (80%) and reduced access to healthcare services. We conducted a three-year, retrospective cohort study of patients presenting with low impact fractures of the humerus or the shoulder griddle, lower end of radius or ulna and forearm, hip fractures (femoral neck, intertrochanteric/subtrochanteric), the lower end of tibia, medial malleolus, lateral malleolus or lower leg. Male and female subjects of 50 years or older were included. Demographic data and information on medications reported at fracture presentation were extracted from electronic medical records. We found that 42% of the patients were taking at least one medication to prevent osteoporosis. The predominant combination was vitamin D plus calcium and bisphosphonates. If patients taking only vitamin D plus calcium are excluded, 16.7% of the sample took osteoporosis medications at the fragility fracture presentation. The likelihood of taking osteoporosis medication was increased by age and type of health insurance (Medicare/private insurance), and concomitant diagnosis of impaired gait and mobility. The percentage of the patients taking prophylactic medications for osteoporosis at the time of a fragility fracture was comparable to reported national standards and associated with increased age and health insurance coverage. In a predominantly Hispanic/Latino patient population living in a medically underserved region, there is substantial recognition and prevention strategies for osteoporosis.",

We use tomato Sw-5b::tospovirus as a model system to study the specific role of the compartmentalized plant NLR in dictating host defense against virus at different infection steps.\nC_LIO_LIWe demonstrated here that tomato NLR Sw-5b translocates to cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively, to play different roles in inducing host resistances against Tomato spotted wilt tospovirus (TSWV) infection. The cytoplasmic Sw-5b functions to induce a strong cell death response to inhibit TSWV replication. This host response is, however, insufficient to block viral intercellular and long-distance movement. The nucleus-localized Sw-5b triggers a host defense that weakly inhibits viral replication but strongly impedes virus intercellular and systemic movement. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic and nuclear Sw-5b act synergistically to dictate full host defense to TSWV infection.\nC_LIO_LIWe further demonstrated that the extended N-terminal Solanaceae domain (SD) of Sw-5b plays critical roles in cytoplasm/nucleus partitioning. Sw-5b nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) controls its cytoplasm localization. Strikingly, the SD but not coil-coil (CC) domain is crucial for Sw-5b receptor to translocate from cytoplasm to nucleus to trigger the immunity. The SD was found to interact with importins. Silencing both importin  and {beta} expression disrupted Sw-5b nucleus translocation and host immunity against TSWV systemic infection.\nC_LIO_LICollectively, our findings suggest that Sw-5b bifurcates disease resistances by cytoplasm/nucleus partitioning to block different infection steps of TSWV.

Here we propose two new models of a reversible covalent-modification cycle with positive autoregulation (PAR) - a motif structure that is thought to be capable of both ultrasensitivity and bistability in different parameter regimes. These new models appeal to a modelling framework that we call complex complete, which accounts fully for the molecular complexities of the underlying signalling mechanisms. Each of the two new models encodes a specific molecular mechanism for PAR. We demonstrate that the modelling simplifications for PAR models that have been used in previous work, which rely on a Michaelian approximation for the enzyme-mediated reactions, are unable to accurately recapitulate the qualitative signalling responses supported by our  full complex-complete models. Strikingly, we show that the parameter regimes in which ultrasensitivity and bistability obtain in the complex-complete framework contradict the predictions made by the Michaelian simplification. Our results highlight the critical importance of accurately representing the molecular details of biochemical signalling mechanisms, and strongly suggest that the Michaelian approximation may be inadequate for predictive models of enzyme-mediated chemical reactions with added regulations.",

We used the distal MCAO stroke model (pdMCAO) to explore the cellular and temporal gliosis response in secondary thalamic injury in mice. At 3 days post-stroke (PSD3), primary infarct was limited to the cortex, with no infarct in the thalamus. However, at 2 weeks after stroke (PSD14), the ipsilateral thalamus demonstrated degenerating and severely damaged neurons. Staining for GFAP (astrogliosis) or IBA-1 (microgliosis) was first apparent in the ipsilateral thalamus by PSD3, and showed a progressive increase through PSD14. The number of activated microglia was increased within the thalamus at PSD14, reflecting proliferation of resident microglia as well as infiltration of peripheral monocytes. Interestingly, astrogliosis within the thalamus was enduring, as it was still evident at two years post-stroke. Furthermore, the astrogliosis at two years (but not at 6 weeks) demonstrated glial scar-like characteristics. Lastly, we demonstrated that post-stroke treatment with an NMDA receptor antagonist (memantine) reduces gliosis in the thalamus at PSD14. These findings highlight the development of lasting secondary injury in the thalamus following cortical stroke and support the value of memantine treatment in the mitigation of this injury.",

    "abstract": "Operant behavior procedures often rely on visual stimuli to cue the initiation or secession of a response, and to provide a means for discriminating between two or more simultaneously available responses. While primate and human studies typically use LCD or OLED monitors and touch screens, rodent studies use a variety of methods to present visual cues ranging from traditional incandescent light bulbs, single LEDs, and, more recently, touch screen monitors. Commercially available systems for visual stimulus presentation are costly, challenging to customize, and are typically closed source. We developed an open-source, highly-modifiable visual stimulus presentation platform that can be combined with a 3D-printed operant response device. The device uses an eight by eight matrix of LEDs, and can be expanded to control much larger LED matrices. Implementing the platform is low-cost (<$70 USD per device in the year 2020). Using the platform, we trained rats to make nosepoke responses and discriminate between two distinct visual cues in a location-independent manner. This visual stimulus presentation platform is a cost-effective way to implement complex visually-guided operant behavior, including the use of moving or dynamically changing visual stimuli.\n\nSignificance StatementThe design of an open source and low cost device for presenting visual stimuli is described. It is capable of presenting complex visual patterns and dynamically changing stimuli. A practical demonstration of the device is also reported, from an experiment in which rats performed a luminance based visual discrimination. The device has utility for studying visual processing, psychophysics, and decision making in a variety of species.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is the aetiological agent of COVID-19 disease and has been spreading worldwide since December 2019. The virus has been shown to infect different animal species under experimental conditions. Also, minks have been found to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection in fur farms in Europe and the USA. Here we investigated 91 individual minks from a farm located in Northern Poland. Using RT-PCR, antigen detection and NGS, we confirmed 15 animals positive for SARS-CoV-2. The result was verified by sequencing of full viral genomes, confirming SARS-CoV-2 infection in Polish mink. Country-scale monitoring conducted by veterinary inspection so far has not detected the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on other mink farms. Taking into consideration that Poland has a high level of positive diagnostic tests among its population, there is a high risk that more Polish mink farms become a source for SARS-CoV-2. Findings reported here and from other fur producing countries urge the assessment of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in animals bred in Polish fur farms.",

To that end, we also developed a machine learning label transfer approach lever-aging cell type, chamber, and laterality annotations available for primary human fetal heart cells.

According to previous studies, the southeast-northwest route would have been the most frequently used. However, few studies have assessed the use of these routes based on multiple species. Here we present a compilation of potential mammal species that could have dispersed between the two forest regions to investigate these connections. We evaluate the geographic distributions of mammals occurring in both Amazonia and the Atlantic Forest and the likely connective routes between these forests. We classified the species per habitat occupancy (strict forest specialists, species that prefer forest, or generalists) and compiled the genetic data available for each species to evaluate their potential for phylogeographic studies focusing on genetic exchange between the two forest regions. We found 127 mammalian species occurring in both Amazonia and the Atlantic Forest for which significant genetic data was available. Hence, highlighting their potential for phylogeographic studies investigating the past connections between the two forests. Differently from what was previously proposed, the northeast route showed evidence of past use by more mammal species than the remaining two routes. The central route would have been the second most important in terms of species. Our results show the potential of using mammal species to investigate and bring new insights about the past connections between Amazonia and the Atlantic Forest.",

Since caring is an important determinant of fitness, understanding the origin and maintenance of various parental care strategies is a key question in evolutionary biology. Here we investigate parental care patterns in birds, which exhibit a remarkable diversity of parental sex roles. By means of phylogenetically informed comparative analyses we investigate whether and how care provisioning is predicted by ecology and social environment. Making use of the most comprehensive dataset including 1101 species that represent 126 avian families, we show that sex differences in parental care are neither related to food type nor to nest type, two key ecological factors. However, we found an effect of the social environment, as males tend to care relatively more in in colonial species than in non-colonial species. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of social effects for evolution of diverse parental sex roles.",

The AutoVEM tool developed in the present study could complete all mutations detections, haplotypes classification, haplotype subgroup epidemic trends and key mutations analysis for 131,576 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences in 18 hours on a 1 core CPU and 2G internal storage computer. Through haplotype subgroup epidemic trends analysis of 131,576 genome sequences, the great significance of the previous 4 specific sites (C241T, C3037T, C14408T and A23403G) was further revealed, and 6 new mutation sites of highly linked (T445C, C6286T, C22227T, G25563T, C26801G and G29645T) were discovered for the first time that might be related to the infectivity, pathogenicity or host adaptability of SARS-CoV-2. In brief, we proposed an integrative method and developed an efficient automated tool to monitor haplotype subgroup epidemic trends and screen out the key mutations in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 over time for the first time, and all data could be updated quickly to track the prevalence of previous key mutations and new key mutations because of high efficiency of the tool. In addition, the idea of combinatorial analysis in the present study can also provide a reference for the mutation monitoring of other viruses.",

    "abstract": "The ultimate goal of genome assembly is a high-accuracy gapless genome. Here we report a new assembly pipeline which we have used to produce a gapless genome for the indica rice cultivar Minghui 63. The 395.82 Mb final assembly is composed of 12 contigs with a contig N50 size of 31.82 Mb. All chromosomes are now gapless, with each chromosome represented by a single contig. This is the first gapless genome assembly achieved for higher plants or animals. BUSCO evaluation showed that gene regions of our assembly have higher completeness than the current rice reference genome (IRGSP-1.0). Compared with japonica rice, indica has more transposable elements (TEs) and segmental duplications (SDs), the latter of which produce many duplicated genes that can affect plant traits through dose effect or sub-/neo-functionalization. The insertion of TEs can also affect the expression of duplicated genes, which may drive evolution of these genes. We also found the expansion of NBS-LRR disease resistance genes and cZOGT growth-related genes in SDs, suggesting that SDs contribute to the adaptative evolution of rice disease resistance and developmental processes. Our findings suggest that active TEs and SDs together provide synergistic effects to promote rice genome evolution.",

In this study, we provide a systematic interpretation of the nature of these mutations using an entropy-based classification model that relies on evolutionary data from extant protein sequences. Using this model in conjunction with experimental analyses, we identify two previously reported mutations that form an epistatic pair in the RNA-editing functional landscape of ABEs. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal the atomistic details of how these two mutations affect substrate-binding and catalytic activity, via both individual and cooperative effects, hence providing insights into the mechanisms through which these two mutations are epistatically coupled.",

Using a stochastic dynamic model, we show that RNA moieties dynamically regulate serine and glycine concentration, shaping the system behaviour. For the first time we observe an active functional role of the RNA in the regulation of the serine-glycine metabolism and availability, which unravels a complex layer of regulation that cancer cells exploit to fine tune amino acids availability according to their metabolic needs. The quantitative model, complemented by an experimental validation in the lung adeno-carcinoma cell line H1299, exploits RNA molecules as metabolic switches of the SHMT1 activity. Our results pave the way for the development of RNA-based molecules able to unbalance serine metabolism in cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Aortic diameter is a standard parameter for defining disease severity of thoracic aortic aneurysms. In mouse studies, aortic diameters can be measured in situ directly, but this approach has a potential confounder of underestimation due to the absence of physiological arterial blood pressure. In the present study, we developed an in situ approach for authentic aortic measurements. Thoracic aortic aneurysms were induced by beta-aminopropionitrile (BAPN, 0.5% wt/vol) administration in 4-week-old male C57BL/6J mice. Ultrasonography was performed to examine aortic dimensions, and mice with thoracic aortic dilatations were terminated subsequently. After saline perfusion through the left ventricle, periaortic tissues were removed to expose thoracic aortas. Optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound was injected via the left ventricle to maintain aortic patency. In situ aortic images were captured pre- and post-OCT injection. In mice with severe thoracic aortic aneurysms, smaller aortic diameters were observed prior to OCT injection compared to ultrasound measurements, while aortic diameters in situ after OCT were comparable to diameters measured using ultrasound. A telemetry system demonstrated that maximal luminal pressures during 150 ul of OCT injection were 90 mmHg. Immunostaining for CD31 revealed that endothelial cells were preserved in the intima after OCT injection. These results indicate that OCT injection does not cause aortic damages due to excess pressures. In conclusion, in situ imaging with OCT injection provides authentic aortic measurements without overt aortic damage in mice with thoracic aortic aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has inspired renewed interest in understanding the fundamental pathology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) following infection because fatal COVID-19 cases are commonly linked to respiratory failure due to ARDS. The pathologic alteration known as diffuse alveolar damage in endothelial and epithelial cells is a critical feature of acute lung injury in ARDS. However, the pathogenesis of ARDS following SRAS-CoV-2 infection remains largely unknown.\n\nIn the present study, we examined apoptosis in post-mortem lung sections from COVID-19 patients and lung tissues from a non-human primate model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in a cell-type manner, including type 1 and 2 alveolar cells and vascular endothelial cells (ECs), macrophages, and T cells. Multiple-target immunofluorescence (IF) assays and western blotting suggest both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways are activated during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 fails to induce apoptosis in human bronchial epithelial cells (i.e., BEAS2B cells) and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), which are refractory to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, infection of co-cultured Vero cells and HUVECs or Vero cells and BEAS2B cells with SARS-CoV-2 induced apoptosis in both Vero cells and HUVECs/BEAS2B cells, but did not alter the permissiveness of HUVECs or BEAS2B cells to the virus. Post-exposure treatment of the co-culture of Vero cells and HUVECs with an EPAC1-specific activator ameliorated apoptosis in HUVECs. These findings may help to delineate a novel insight into the pathogenesis of ARDS following SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "Besides antigen-specific responses to viral antigens, humoral immune response in virus infection can generate polyreactive and autoreactive antibodies. Dengue and Zika virus infections have been linked to antibody-mediated autoimmune disorders including Guillain-Barre syndrome. A unique feature of flaviviruses is the secretion of non-structural protein 1 (NS1) by infected cells. NS1 is highly immunogenic and antibodies targeting NS1 can have both protective and pathogenic roles. In the present study, we investigated the humoral immune response to Zika virus NS1 and found NS1 to be an immunodominant viral antigen associated with the presence of autoreactive antibodies. Through single B cell cultures, we coupled binding assays and BCR sequencing, confirming the immunodominance of NS1. Of note, we demonstrate the presence of self-reactive clones in germinal centers after both infection and immunization, some of which clones presenting cross-reactivity with NS1. Sequence analysis of anti-NS1 B cell clones showed sequence features associated with pathogenic autoreactive antibodies. Our findings demonstrate NS1 immunodominance at the cellular level as well as a potential role for NS1 in ZIKV associated autoimmune manifestations.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged as a new human pathogen in late 2019 and has infected an estimated 10% of the global population in less than a year. There is a clear need for effective antiviral drugs to complement current preventive measures including vaccines. In this study, we demonstrate that berberine and obatoclax, two broad-spectrum antiviral compounds, are effective against multiple isolates of SARS-CoV-2. Berberine, a plant-derived alkaloid, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar concentrations and obatoclax, originally developed as an anti-apoptotic protein antagonist, was effective at sub-micromolar concentrations. Time-of-addition studies indicated that berberine acts on the late stage of the viral life cycle. In agreement, berberine mildly affected viral RNA synthesis, but strongly reduced infectious viral titers, leading to an increase in the particle-to-pfu ratio. In contrast, obatoclax acted at the early stage of the infection, in line with its activity to neutralize the acidic environment in endosomes. We assessed infection of primary human nasal epithelial cells cultured on an air-liquid interface and found that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced and repressed expression of a specific set of cytokines and chemokines. Moreover, both obatoclax and berberine inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in these primary target cells. We propose berberine and obatoclax as potential antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 that could be considered for further efficacy testing.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionIt is possible to induce pluripotent stem cells from somatic cells, offering an infinite cell resource with the potential for disease research and use in regenerative medicine. Due to ease of accessibility, minimum invasive treatment, and can be kept frozen, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were an attractive source cell. VC6TFZ, a small molecule compound, has been successfully reprogrammed from mouse fibroblast induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). However, it has not been confirmed in humans.\n\nObjectiveThe aim of this research is to determine whether the small molecule compound VC6TFZ can induced pluripotency of PBMC to generate iPSCs detected with expression of SSEA4 and TRA1-60.\n\nMethodsUsing the centrifugation gradient density process, mononuclear cells were separated from peripheral venous blood. Mononuclear cells were cultured for 6 days in the expansion medium. The cells were divided into four groups; group 1 (P1), which was not exposed to small molecules (control group) and groups 2-4 (P2-P4), the experimental groups, subjected to various dosages of the small molecule compound VC6TFZ (VPA, CHIR, Tranylcypromine, FSK, Dznep, and TTNPB). The induction of pluripotency using small molecule compound VC6TFZ was completed within 14 days, then for 7 days the medium shifted to 2i medium. iPSCs identification in based on colony morphology and pluripotent gene expression, SSEA4 and TRA1-60 marker, using immunocytochemistry.\n\nResultsColonies appeared on reprogramming process in day 7th. These colonies had round, large, and cobble stone morphology like ESC. Gene expression of SSEA4 and TRA 1-60 increased statisticaly significant than control group (SSEA4 were P2 p=0.007; P3 p=0.001; P4 p=0.009 and TRA 1-60 were P2 p=0.002; P3 p=0.001; P4 p=0.001).\n\nConclusionSmall molecule compound VC6TFZ could induced pluripotency of human PBMC to generate iPSCs. Pluripotxency marker gene expression, SSEA 4 and TRA 1-60, in the experimental group was statistically significantly higher than in the control group.",

    "abstract": "The poles of the heart and branchiomeric muscles of the face and neck are formed from the cardiopharyngeal mesoderm (CPM) within the pharyngeal apparatus. The formation of the cardiac outflow tract and branchiomeric muscles are disrupted in patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS), due to haploinsufficiency of TBX1, encoding a T-box transcription factor. Here, using single cell RNA-sequencing, we identified a multilineage primed population (MLP) within the CPM, marked by the Tbx1 lineage, which has bipotent properties to form cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. The MLPs are localized within the nascent mesoderm of the caudal lateral pharyngeal apparatus and provide a continuous source of progenitors that undergo TBX1-dependent progression towards maturation. Tbx1 also regulates the balance between MLP maintenance and maturation while restricting ectopic non-mesodermal gene expression. We further show that TBX1 confers this balance by direct regulation of MLP enriched genes and downstream pathways, partly through altering chromatin accessibility. Our study thus uncovers a new cell population and reveals novel mechanisms by which Tbx1 directs the development of the pharyngeal apparatus, which is profoundly altered in 22q11.2DS.",

    "abstract": "ContextSpatial capture-recapture (SCR) models are increasingly popular for analyzing wildlife monitoring data. SCR can account for spatial heterogeneity in detection that arises from individual space use (detection kernel), variation in the sampling process, and the distribution of individuals (density). However, unexplained and unmodeled spatial heterogeneity in detectability may remain due to cryptic factors, intrinsic and extrinsic to the study system.\n\nObjectivesWe identify how the magnitude and configuration of unmodeled, spatially variable detection probability influence SCR parameter estimates.\n\nMethodsWe simulated realistic SCR data with spatially variable and autocorrelated detection probability. We then fitted a single-session SCR model ignoring this variation to the simulated data and assessed the impact of model misspecification on inferences.\n\nResultsHighly autocorrelated spatial heterogeneity in detection probability (Morans I = 0.85 - 0.96), modulated by the magnitude of that variation, can lead to pronounced negative bias (up to 75%), reduction in precision (249%), and decreasing coverage probability of the 95% credible intervals associated with abundance estimates to 0. Conversely, at low levels of spatial autocorrelation (median Morans I = 0), even severe unmodeled heterogeneity in detection probability did not lead to pronounced bias and only caused slight reductions in precision and coverage of abundance estimates.\n\nConclusionsUnknown and unmodeled variation in detection probability is liable to be the norm, rather than the exception, in SCR studies. We encourage practitioners to consider the impact that spatial autocorrelation in detectability has on their inferences and urge the development of SCR methods that can take structured unknown or partially unknown spatial variability in detection probability into account.",

    "abstract": "Since the beginning of the COVID19 pandemics, an unprecedented research effort has been conducted to analyze the antibody responses in patients, and many trials based on passive immunotherapy -- notably monoclonal antibodies -- are ongoing. Twenty-one antibodies have entered clinical trials, 6 having reached phase 2/3, phase 3 or having received emergency authorization. These represent only the tip of the iceberg, since many more antibodies have been discovered and represent opportunities either for diagnosis purposes or as drug candidates. The main problem facing laboratories willing to develop such antibodies is the huge task of analyzing them and choosing the best candidate for exhaustive experimental validation. In this work we show how artificial intelligence-based methods can help in analyzing large sets of antibodies in order to determine in a few hours the best candidates in few hours. The MAbCluster method, which only requires knowledge of the amino acid sequences of the antibodies, allows to group the antibodies having the same epitope, considering only their amino acid sequences and their 3D structures (actual or predicted), and to infer some of their functional properties. We then use MAbTope to predict the epitopes for all antibodies for which they are not already known. This allows an exhaustive comparison of the available epitopes, but also gives a synthetic view of the possible combinations. Finally, we show how these results can be used to predict which antibodies might be affected by the different mutations arising in the circulating strains of the virus, such as the N501Y mutation that has started to spread in Great-Britain.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic analysis is a widely used approach for analyzing and illustrating gene/protein/species evolution and is being benefited by the increasing number of species with their DNA/genome sequenced. Generating a phylogenetic tree with sequences from hundreds of species can be considered a routine task. However, tree visualization has been challenged to organize and bring by accessible means relevant information, e.g. taxonomy, about the sampled genes/proteins. Here we present TaxOnTree, a computational tool that incorporates and allows a quick accession of the taxonomic information of samples in a phylogenetic tree. TaxOnTree takes as input a single phylogenetic tree in Newick format containing gene/protein identifiers from NCBI or Uniprot databases in their leaves but TaxOnTree also allows users to have as input a protein identifier, a single protein in FASTA, a list of protein accessions, or a(n) (un)aligned multi-FASTA file. Non-tree inputs are submitted to a phylogenetic reconstruction pipeline implemented into TaxOnTree. The tree provided by the user or generated by the pipeline is converted to Nexus format and then automatically annotated with the taxonomic information of each sample comprising the tree. The taxonomic information is retrieved by web requests from NCBI or Uniprot servers or from a local MySQL database and annotated as tags in the tree nodes. The final tree archive is in Nexus format and should be opened with FigTree software which allows visual inspection, by branch coloring or tip/node labeling, of the taxonomic information incorporated in the tree. TaxOnTree provides prompt inspection of the taxonomic distribution of orthologs and paralogs. It can be used for manual curation of taxonomic/phylogenetic scenarios and coupled to any tool that links homologous sequences to a seed sequence. TaxOnTree provides computational support to help users to inspect phylogenetic trees with a taxonomic view, even without being taxonomy experts. TaxOnTree is available at http://bioinfo.icb.ufmg.br/taxontree.",
