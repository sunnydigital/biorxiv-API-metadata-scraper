    "abstract": "Immune responses rely on a complex adaptive system in which the body and infections interact at multiple scales and in different compartments. We developed a modular model of CD4+ T cells which uses four modeling approaches to integrate processes taking place at three spatial scales in different tissues. In each cell, signal transduction and gene regulation are described by a logical model, metabolism by constraint-based models. Cell population dynamics are described by an agent-based model and systemic cytokine concentrations by ordinary differential equations. A Monte Carlo simulation algorithm allows information to flow efficiently between the four modules by separating the time scales. Such modularity improves computational performance and versatility, and facilitates data integration. Our technology helps capture emergent behaviors that arise from nonlinear dynamics interwoven across three scales. Multi-scale insights added to single-scale studies allowed us to identify switch-like and oscillatory behaviors of CD4+ T cells at the population level, which are both novel and immunologically important. We envision our model and the generic framework encompassing it to become the foundation of a more comprehensive model of the human immune system.",

    "abstract": "Brachial plexus birth injury (BPBI) causes functional arm impairment in 30-40% of those affected due to altered loading on the glenohumeral joint. While gross morphological osseous deformities have been seen in the humerus and scapula, alterations in the underlying trabecular bone microstructure and mineralization are not clear. Using a murine model of BPBI, trabecular bone alterations were explored in the proximal humerus and distal scapula, which surround the articulating surface of the joint. Samples were scanned using micro-CT, reoriented, and analyzed for standard trabecular metrics. The regions of interest closest to the articulating surface showed the greatest detriments. In the scapula, the scapular neck region showed less robust trabecular bone in the neurectomy group with decreased BV/TV (p=0.001), BMD (p=0.001), Conn.D (p=0.006), Tb.N (p<0.0001), and DA (p=0.033), and increased Tb.Sp (p<0.0001) compared to sham. In the humerus, the epiphysis showed less robust trabecular bone in neurectomy group, but to a much lesser extent than the scapular neck. The neurectomy group showed reduced BMD (p=0.007) and Tb.N (p=0.029) compared to sham. Data suggest deformities are worse near the articulating surface, likely due to the greater amount of mechanical loading. The reduction in trabecular microstructure and mineralization may compromise bone strength of the affected limb following BPBI. Further investigation of the underlying trabecular bone deformities following injury are necessary to eventually inform better treatments to limit the development of deformities.",

    "abstract": "The scaffold protein Tks5 is required for invadopodia-mediated cancer invasion both in vitro and in vivo. We have previously also revealed a role for Tks5 in tumor cell growth using three-dimensional (3D) culture model systems and mouse transplantation experiments. Here we use both 3D and high-density fibrillar collagen (HDFC) culture to demonstrate that native type I collagen, but not a form lacking the telopeptides, stimulated Tks5-dependent growth, which was dependent on the DDR collagen receptors. We used microenvironmental microarray (MEMA) technology to determine that laminin, collagen I, fibronectin and tropoelastin also stimulated invadopodia formation. A Tks5-specific monoclonal antibody revealed its expression both on microtubules and at invadopodia. High- and super-resolution microscopy of cells in and on collagen was then used to place Tks5 at the base of invadopodia, separated from much of the actin and cortactin, but coincident with both matrix metalloprotease and cathepsin proteolytic activity. Inhibition of the Src family kinases, cathepsins or metalloproteases all reduced invadopodia length but each had distinct effects on Tks5 localization. These studies highlight the crosstalk between invadopodia and extracellular matrix components, and reveal the invadopodium to be a spatially complex structure.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of cruciviruses revealed the most explicit example of a common protein homologue between DNA and RNA viruses to date. Cruciviruses are a novel group of circular Rep-encoding ssDNA (CRESS-DNA) viruses that encode capsid proteins (CPs) that are most closely related to those encoded by RNA viruses in the family Tombusviridae. The apparent chimeric nature of the two core proteins encoded by crucivirus genomes suggests horizontal gene transfer of CP genes between DNA and RNA viruses. Here, we identified and characterized 451 new crucivirus genomes and ten CP-encoding circular genetic elements through de novo assembly and mining of metagenomic data. These genomes are highly diverse, as demonstrated by sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analysis of subsets of the protein sequences they encode. Most of the variation is reflected in the replication associated protein (Rep) sequences, and much of the sequence diversity appears to be due to recombination. Our results suggest that recombination tends to occur more frequently among groups of cruciviruses with relatively similar capsid proteins, and that the exchange of Rep protein domains between cruciviruses is rarer than gene exchange. Altogether, we provide a comprehensive and descriptive characterization of cruciviruses.\n\nIMPORTANCEViruses are the most abundant biological entities on Earth. In addition to their impact on animal and plant health, viruses have important roles in ecosystem dynamics as well as in the evolution of the biosphere. Circular Rep-encoding single-stranded (CRESS) DNA viruses are ubiquitous in nature, many are agriculturally important, and are viruses that appear to have multiple origins from prokaryotic plasmids. CRESS-DNA viruses such as the cruciviruses, have homologues of capsid proteins (CPs) encoded by RNA viruses. The genetic structure of cruciviruses attests to the transfer of capsid genes between disparate groups of viruses. However, the evolutionary history of cruciviruses is still unclear. By collecting and analyzing cruciviral sequence data, we provide a deeper insight into the evolutionary intricacies of cruciviruses. Our results reveal an unexpected diversity of this virus group, with frequent recombination as an important determinant of variability.",

    "abstract": "Microfluidic vortex shedding (VS) can rapidly deliver mRNA to T cells with high yield. The mechanistic underpinning of VS intracellular delivery remains undefined and VS-Cas9 genome editing requires further studies. Herein, we evaluated a series of VS devices containing splitter plates to attenuate vortex shedding and understand the contribution of computed force and frequency on efficiency and viability. We then selected a VS design to knockout the expression of the endogenous T cell receptor in primary human T cells via delivery of CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) with and without brief exposure to an electric field (eVS). VS alone resulted in an equivalent yield of genome-edited T cells relative to electroporation with improved cell quality. A 1.8-fold increase in editing efficiency was demonstrated with eVS with negligible impact on cell viability. Cumulatively, these results demonstrate the utility of VS and eVS for genome editing human primary T cells with Cas9 RNPs.",
