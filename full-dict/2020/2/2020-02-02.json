    "abstract": "Small-molecule drugs are utilized in a wide variety of clinical applications, however, many of these drugs suffer from one or more suboptimal property that can hinder its delivery or cellular action in vivo, or even shelf an otherwise biologically tolerable drug. While high-throughput screening provides a method to discover drugs with altered chemical properties, directly engineering small-molecule bioconjugates provides an opportunity to specifically modulate drug properties rather than sifting through large drug libraries with seemingly  random drug properties. Herein, we propose that selectively \"tethering\" a drug molecule to an additional group with favorable properties will improve the drug conjugates overall properties, such as solubility. Specifically, we outlined the site-specific chemical conjugation of rapamycin (RAP) to an additional \"high-affinity\" group to increase the overall affinity the drug has for cyclodextrin-based polymers (pCD). By doing so, we found that RAPs affinity for pCD and RAPs window of delivery from pCD microparticles was tripled without sacrificing RAPs cellular action. This synthesis method was applied to the concept of \"affinity\" for pCD, but other prosthetic groups can be used in a similar manner to modify other drug properties. This study displays potential for increasing drug delivery windows of small-molecule drugs in pCD systems for chronic drug therapies and introduces the idea of altering drug properties to tune polymer-drug interactions.",

    "abstract": "Cell-cell interactions influence all aspects of development, homeostasis, and disease. In cancer, interactions between cancer cells and stromal cells play a major role in nearly every step of carcinogenesis. Thus, the ability to record cell-cell interactions would facilitate mechanistic delineation of the role of cancer microenvironment. Here, we describe GFP-based Touching Nexus (G-baToN) which relies upon nanobody-directed fluorescent protein transfer to enable sensitive and specific labeling of cells after cell-cell interactions. G-baToN is a generalizable system that enables physical contact-based labeling between various cell types, including diverse cancer-stromal cell pairs. A suite of orthogonal baToN tools enables reciprocal cell-cell labeling, interaction-dependent cargo transfer, and the identification of higher-order cell-cell interactions across a wide range of cell types. The ability to track physically interacting cells with these simple and sensitive systems will greatly accelerate our understanding of the outputs of cell-cell interactions in cancer as well as across many biological processes.",

    "abstract": "Optoacoustic (photoacoustic) imaging has seen marked technological advances in detection and data analysis, but there is less progress in understanding the photophysics of optoacoustic signal generation of commonly used contrast agents, such as dyes and chromoproteins. This gap blocks the precise development of novel agents and the accurate analysis and interpretation of Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT) images. To close it, we developed a multimodal laser spectrometer (MLS) to enable the simultaneous measurement of optoacoustic, absorbance, and fluorescence spectra. MLS provides reproducible, high-quality optoacoustic (non-radiative) spectra by using correction and referencing workflow. Herein, we employ MLS to analyze several common dyes (Methylene Blue, Rhodamine 800, Alexa Fluor 750, IRDye 800CW and Indocyanine green) and proteins (sfGFP, mCherry, mKate, HcRed, iRFP720 and smURFP) and shed light on their internal conversion properties. Our data shows that the optical absorption spectra do not correlate with the optoacoustic spectra for the majority of the analytes. We determine that for dyes, the transition underlying the high energy shoulder, which mostly correlates with an aggregation state of the dyes, has significantly more optoacoustic signal generation efficiency than the monomer transition. Our analyses for proteins point to a favored vibrational relaxation and optoacoustic signal generation that stems from the neutral or zwitterionic chromophores. We were able to crystalize HcRed in its optoacoustic state, confirming the change isomerization respect to its fluorescence state. Such data is highly relevant for the engineering of tailored contrast agents for optoacoustic imaging. Furthermore, discrepancies between absorption and optoacoustic spectra underline the importance of correct spectral information as a prerequisite for the spectral-unmixing schemes that are often required for in vivo imaging. Finally, optoacoustic spectra of some of the most commonly used proteins and dyes in optical imaging, recorded on our MLS, reveal previously unknown photophysical characteristics, such as unobserved photo-switching behavior.",

    "abstract": "Primary cilia are important organizing centers that control diverse cellular processes. Apicomplexan parasites like Toxoplasma gondii have a specialized cilium-like structure called the conoid that organizes the secretory and invasion machinery critical for the parasites lifestyle. The proteins that initiate the biogenesis of this structure are largely unknown. We identified the Toxoplasma ortholog of the conserved kinase ERK7 as essential to conoid assembly. Parasites in which ERK7 has been depleted lose their conoids late during maturation and are immotile and thus unable to invade new host cells. This is the most severe phenotype to conoid biogenesis yet reported, and is made more striking by the fact that ERK7 is not a conoid protein, as it localizes just basal to the structure. ERK7 has been recently implicated in ciliogenesis in metazoan cells, and our data suggest that this kinase has an ancient and central role in regulating ciliogenesis throughout Eukaryota.",

    "abstract": "The regulation of integrin expression and function controls interactions of immune cells and targets their trafficking locally and systemically. We show here that the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 is required for lymphocyte surface expression of the intestinal immune response-associated integrin {beta}7, but not for {beta}1 or {beta}2 integrins. Viable motheaten mice deficient for SHP-1 have less {beta}7 on T cells and lack {beta}7 on B cells. SHP-1 function is targeted in B cells by the B cell specific lectin CD22 (Siglec-2), suggesting a potential role for CD22 in {beta}7 expression. CD22-deficiency on B cells phenocopies the effects of SHP-1 haplodeficiency. Mechanistically, we show that SHP-1 suppresses {beta}7 endocytosis: internalization of {beta}7 but not {beta}1 integrin is accelerated in SHP-1+/- and CD22-/- B cells. Moreover, mutations in CD22 cytoplasmic SHP1-binding ITIM sequences reduce 4{beta}7 comparably, and loss of CD22 lectin activity has an intermediate effect suggesting a model in which the CD22 ITIM sequences recruit SHP-1 to control {beta}7 expression. Integrin 4{beta}7 selectively contributes to cell interactions in intestinal immunity. Consistent with this, CD22 deficient and SHP-1+/- B cells display reduced {beta}7-dependent homing to gut associated Peyers patches (PP); and CD22-deficiency impairs intestinal but not systemic antibody responses and delays clearance of the gut pathogen rotavirus. The results define a novel role for SHP-1 in the differential control of leukocyte integrins and an unexpected integrin {beta}7-specific role for CD22-SHP-1 interplay in mucosal immunity.",

    "abstract": "In Ralstonia solanacearum, a devastating phytopathogen whose metabolism is poorly understood, we observed that Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway and NonOxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OxPPP) bypasses glycolysis and OxPPP under glucose oxidation. Evidences derived from 13C stable isotopes feeding and genome annotation based comparative metabolic network analysis supported the observations. Comparative metabolic network analysis derived from the currently available 53 annotated R. solanacearum strains also including the recently reported strain (F1C1), representing the four phylotypes confirmed the lack of key genes coding for phosphofructokinase (pfk-1) and phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (gnd) enzymes that are relevant for glycolysis and OxPPP respectively. R. solanacearum F1C1 cells fed with 13C Glucose (99%[1-13C]- or 99%[1,2-13C]- or 40%[13C6]-glucose) followed by GC-MS based labelling analysis of fragments from amino acids, glycerol and ribose provided clear evidence that rather than Glycolysis and OxPPP, ED pathway and NonOxPPP are the main routes sustaining metabolism in R. solanacearum. The 13C incorporation in the mass ions of alanine (m/z 260, m/z 232); valine (m/z 288, m/z 260), glycine (m/z 218), serine (m/z 390, m/z 362), histidine (m/z 440, m/z 412), tyrosine (m/z 466, m/z 438), phenylalanine (m/z 336, m/z 308), glycerol (m/z 377) and ribose (m/z 160) mapped the pathways supporting the observations. The outcomes help better defining the central carbon metabolic network of R. solanacearum that can be integrated with 13C metabolic flux analysis as well as flux balance analysis studies for defining the metabolic phenotypes.\n\nImportanceUnderstanding the metabolic versatility of Ralstonia solanacearum is important as it regulates the tradeoff between virulence and metabolism (1, 2) in a wide range of plant hosts. Due to a lack of clear evidence until this work, several published research papers reported on potential roles of Glycolysis and Oxidative pentose phosphate pathways (OxPPP) in R. solanacearum (3, 4). This work provided evidence from 13C stable isotopes feeding and genome annotation based comparative metabolic network analysis that Entner-Doudoroff pathway and Non-OxPPP bypasses glycolysis and OxPPP during the oxidation of Glucose, one of the host xylem pool that serves as a potential carbon source (5). The outcomes help better defining the central carbon metabolic network of R. solanacearum that can be integrated with 13C metabolic flux analysis as well as flux balance analysis studies for defining the metabolic phenotypes. The study highlights the need to critically examine phytopathogens whose metabolism is poorly understood.",

    "abstract": "Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) of the n-6 and n-3 series cannot be synthesized in mammals and therefore are called essential fatty acids (EFAs). Mead acid (20:3n-9) is an unusual n-9 PUFA, endogenously synthesized from oleic acid (18:1n-9) in an EFA-deficient state. Although Elovl5, a fatty acid elongase, has long been known to selectively elongate C18 and C20 PUFAs, it can use 18:1n-9 as a substrate for the synthesis of Mead acid under C20 PUFA-deficient, but not-sufficient, conditions. We found, by an in vitro enzyme assay, that the microsomal fraction obtained from PUFA-deficient, but not -sufficient, cells showed significant Elovl5 activity toward 18:1n-9, with no effect on its constitutive activity toward 18:3n-6, implying that Elovl5 acquires the activity toward 18:1n-9 under the PUFA-deficient conditions at the enzyme level. Further biochemical analysis revealed that Elovl5 was phosphorylated in the C20 PUFA-supplemented cells, and that treatment with an inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) completely abolished the phosphorylation of Elovl5 and retained the Elovl5 activity toward 18:1n-9, even in the presence of C20 PUFA. Finally, mutation of putative phosphorylation sites (T281A/S283A/S285A) on Elovl5 did not decrease the activity of Elovl5 toward 18:1n-9 by supplementation with C20 PUFA, suggesting that the phosphorylation of Elovl5 contributed to a change in substrate preference. Thus, by changing its substrate specificity in an EFA-deficient state, Elovl5 is able to regulate the synthesis of Mead acid to maintain levels of long-chain PUFAs.",

Metastatic disease is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths and involves critical interactions between tumor cells and the microenvironment. Here we focused on elucidating the molecular hallmarks of tumor hypoxia that remains poorly defined. To fill this gap, we analyzed the genomic alterations and hypoxia score of 233 hypoxia-related genes of 6,343 individuals across 17 TCGA Pan-Cancer types. In addition, we analyzed a protein-protein interactome (PPi) network and the shortest paths from hypoxic proteins to metastasis. As results, mRNA high alteration was prevalent in all cancer types. Genomic alterations and hypoxia score presented a highest frequency in tumor stage 4 and positive metastasis status in all cancer types. The most significant signaling pathways were HIF-1, ErbB, PI3K-Akt, FoxO, mTOR, Ras and VEGF. The PPi network revealed a strong association among hypoxic proteins, cancer driver proteins and metastasis driver proteins. The analysis of shortest paths revealed 99 ways to spread metastasis signaling from hypoxic proteins. Additionally, we proposed 62 hypoxic genes strongly associated with metastasis and 27 of them with high amount of genomic alterations. Overall, tumor hypoxia may drive aggressive molecular features across cancer types. Hence, we identified potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets regulated by hypoxia that could be incorporated into strategies aimed at improving novel drug development and treating metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is a chronic liver disease which is observed in people who do not abuse alcohol. Main cause of NAFLD is Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) where there is accumulation of fats such as triglyceride in liver and the disease progression ranges from simple steatosis to fibrosis and cirrhosis. MicroRNAs are critical players in post-transcriptional gene regulation of diseases with complex etiology. In this study, we have elucidated the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathophysiology of NAFLD/NASH and unravelled molecular markers for diagnosis of NAFLD. A subset of genes (n=10) responsible for NAFLD/NASH were selected and detailed in silico analysis carried out using multiple tools. miRDB and DIANA-microT were used to find putative miRNA binding sites followed by analysis using miRTarBase which is an experimentally validated database of miRNA-target interactions. The study elucidated a number of statistically significant predictions for both miRDB (scores >80) and DIANA-microT (values >0.90) and also strong experimental validation in miRTarBase. The analysis revealed that certain miRNAs like miR-7 & miR-548 family members are found in both the programmes, miRDB and DIANA-microT, targeting genes involved in liver function. They were also identified in the experimental validation database miRTarBase. These miRNAs probably play an important role in the pathophysiology of this disease.

An influential framework holds that sensory cortical areas encode the instantaneous sensory evidence and downstream, action-related regions accumulate this evidence. The large-scale distribution of this computation across the cerebral cortex has remained largely elusive. We developed a regionally-specific magnetoencephalography decoding approach to exhaustively map the dynamics of stimulus- and choice-specific signals across the human cortical surface during a visual decision. Comparison with the evidence accumulation dynamics inferred from behavior enabled us to disentangle stimulus-dependent and endogenous components of choice-predictive activity across the visual cortical hierarchy. The endogenous component was present in primary visual cortex, expressed in a low (< 20 Hz) frequency-band, and its time course tracked, with delay, the build-up of choice-predictive activity in (pre-)motor regions. Our results are consistent with choice-specific cortical feedback signaling in a specific frequency channel during decision formation.",

    "abstract": "The phytohormones cytokinin (CK) and auxin are key regulators of plant growth and development. During the last decade specialised transport mechanisms turned out to be the key for the control of local and long distance hormone distributions. In contrast to auxin, CK transport is poorly understood. Here we show that Arabidopsis thaliana AZG2, a member of the AZG purine transporter family, acts as CK transporter involved in the determination of the root system architecture. The expression of AtAZG2 is primarily auxin dependent and restricted to a small group of cells surrounding the lateral root primordia. Compared to wild type, mutants carrying loss-of-function alleles of Atazg2 have higher density of lateral roots, suggesting AZG2 as being part of a regulatory pathway in lateral root emergence. Moreover, azg2 mutants are partially insensitive to exogenously applied CK, which is consistent with the observation that the CK reporter gene TCSnpro:GFP showed lower fluorescence signal in the roots of azg2 mutants compared to those of wild type. These results indicate a defective CK signalling pathway in the region of lateral root primordia. By the integration of AtAZG2 subcellular localization and CK transport capacity data, our results allowed us to propose a local Auxin/CK signalling model for the regulation of lateral root emergence.",

Here we present a new approach to incorporate single or multiple post-translational modifications or non-canonical amino acids into soluble and membrane proteins expressed in eukaryotic cells. We insert synthetic peptides into proteins of interest via tandem protein trans-splicing using two orthogonal split intein pairs and validate our approach by investigating different aspects of GFP, NaV1.5 and P2X2 receptor function.

While the role and regulation of tmACs is well documented, much less is known of sAC in cellular metabolism. We demonstrate here that sAC is an acute regulator of glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation and glycogen metabolism, tuning their relative bioenergetic contributions. Suppression of sAC activity leads to aerobic glycolysis, enhanced glycogenolysis, decreased oxidative phosphorylation, and an elevated cytosolic NADH/NAD+ ratio, resembling the Warburg phenotype. Importantly, we found that glycogen metabolism is regulated in opposite directions by cAMP depending on its location of synthesis and downstream effectors. While the canonical tmAC-cAMP-PKA axis promotes glycogenolysis, we identify a novel sAC-cAMP-Epac1 axis that suppresses glycogenolysis. These data suggest that sAC is an autonomous bioenergetic sensor that suppresses aerobic glycolysis and glycogenolysis when ATP levels suffice. When the ATP level falls, diminished sAC activity induces glycogenolysis and aerobic glycolysis to maintain energy homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Climate change significantly impacts natural populations, particularly phenology traits, like the seasonal onset of reproduction in birds. This impact is mainly via plastic responses in phenology traits to changes in the environment, but the molecular mechanism mediating this plasticity remains elusive. Epigenetic modifications can mediate plasticity and consequently constitute promising candidates for mediating phenology traits. Here, we used genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of individual great tit (Parus major) females that we blood sampled repeatedly throughout the breeding season. We demonstrate rapid and directional variation in DNA methylation within the regulatory region of genes known to play key roles in avian reproduction that are in line with observed changes in gene expression in chickens. Our findings provide an important step towards unraveling the molecular mechanism mediating a key life history trait, an essential knowledge-gap for understanding how natural populations may cope with future climate change.\n\nIMPACT SUMMARYNatural populations are increasingly challenged by changing environmental conditions like global increases in temperature. A key way for species to adapt to global warming is via phenotypic plasticity, i.e. the ability to adjust the expression of traits to the environment. We, however, know little about how the environment can interact with an organisms genetic make-up to shape its trait value. Epigenetic marks are known to vary with the environment and can modulate the expression of traits without any change in the genetic make-up and therefore have the potential to mediate phenotypic plasticity.\n\nTo study the role of epigenetics for phenotypic plasticity, we here focus on the great tit (Parus major), a species that is strongly affected by global warming and plastic for temperature in an essential phenology trait, the seasonal onset of egg laying. As a first step, we investigated whether great tit females show within-individual and short-term variation in DNA methylation that corresponds to changes in the reproductive state of females. We therefore housed breeding pairs in climate-controlled aviaries to blood sample each female repeatedly throughout the breeding season and used these repeated samples for methylation profiling.\n\nWe found rapid and directional variation in DNA methylation at the time females prepared to initiate egg laying that is located within the regulatory region of genes that have previously described functions for avian reproduction. Although future work is needed to establish a causal link between the observed temporal variation in DNA methylation and the onset of reproduction in female great tits, our work highlights the potential role for epigenetic modifications in mediating an essential phenology trait that is sensitive to temperatures.",

The controversial live attenuated virus vaccine Dengvaxia has boosted the pursuit of sub-unit vaccine approaches, and the non-structural protein 1 (NS1) has recently emerged as a promising candidate. However, we found that NS1 immunization or passive transfer of NS1 antibodies failed to confer protection in symptomatic dengue mouse models using two non mouse-adapted DENV2 strains from the Cosmopolitan genotype that currently circulates in South-East Asia. Furthermore, exogenous administration of purified NS1 did not worsen in vivo vascular leakage in sub-lethally infected mice, thereby supporting that NS1 does not play a critical role in the pathogenesis of these DENV2 strains. Virus chimerization approaches indicated that the prME structural region, but not NS1, plays a critical role in driving in vivo fitness and virulence of the virus, through induction of key pro-inflammatory cytokines. This work highlights that the pathogenic role of NS1 is DENV strain-dependent, which warrants re-evaluation of NS1 as a universal dengue vaccine candidate.",

    "abstract": "The infection of a novel coronavirus found in Wuhan of China (2019-nCoV) is rapidly spreading, and the incidence rate is increasing worldwide. Due to the lack of effective treatment options for 2019-nCoV, various strategies are being tested in China, including drug repurposing. In this study, we used our pretrained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of 2019-nCoV. The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing a inhibitory potency with Kd of 94.94 nM against the 2019-nCoV 3C-like proteinase, followed by efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM). Interestingly, lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases. However, in our prediction, they may also bind to the replication complex components of 2019-nCoV with an inhibitory potency with Kd < 1000 nM. In addition, we also found that several antiviral agents, such as Kaletra, could be used for the treatment of 2019-nCoV, although there is no real-world evidence supporting the prediction. Overall, we suggest that the list of antiviral drugs identified by the MT-DTI model should be considered, when establishing effective treatment strategies for 2019-nCoV.",

First, SIRT1 deacetylates SIRT6 at residue K33, which is important for SIRT6 polymerization and mobilization toward DSBs. Then, K33-deacetylated SIRT6 anchors to {gamma}H2AX, allowing its retention on and subsequent remodeling of local chromatin. We show that a K33R mutation that mimics hypoacetylated SIRT6 can rescue defective DNA repair as a result of SIRT1 deficiency in cultured cells. These data highlight the synergistic action between SIRTs in the spatiotemporal regulation of the DDR and DNA repair.",

Moreover, current studies often focused on isolated steps of the process and do not address the impact of a tool on both the intermediate and the final steps of the analysis. Here, we present a flexible R framework for pipeline comparison with multi-level evaluation metrics. We apply it to the benchmark of scRNAseq analysis pipelines using simulated and real datasets with known cell identities, covering common methods of filtering, doublet detection, normalization, feature selection, denoising, dimensionality reduction and clustering. We evaluate the choice of these tools with multi-purpose metrics to assess their ability to reveal cell population structure and lead to efficient clustering. On the basis of our systematic evaluations of analysis pipelines, we make a number of practical recommendations about current analysis choices and for a comprehensive pipeline. The evaluation framework that we developed, pipeComp (https://github.com/plger/pipeComp), has been implemented so as to easily integrate any other step, tool, or evaluation metric allowing extensible benchmarks and easy applications to other fields of research in Bioinformatics, as we demonstrate through a study of the impact of removal of unwanted variation on differential expression analysis.",

However, significant gaps exist in our understanding of the spatiotemporal organization of NOM composition. We suggest that the underlying mechanisms governing NOM can be revealed by applying tools and concepts from metacommunity ecology to environmental metabolomics. After illustrating the similarities between metabolomes and ecological communities, we call this conceptual synthesis  meta-metabolome ecology and demonstrate its potential utility using a freshwater mass spectrometry dataset. Specifically, we developed three relational metabolite dendrograms using combinations of molecular properties (i.e., aromaticity index, double-bond equivalents, etc.) and putative biochemical transformations. Using these dendrograms, which are similar to phylogenetic or functional trait trees in ecological communities, we illustrate potential analytical techniques by investigating relationally-informed -diversity and {beta}-diversity metrics (e.g., MPD, MNTD, UniFrac), and null model analyses (e.g., NRI, NTI, and {beta}NTI). Furthermore, we demonstrate that this synthesis allows ecological communities (e.g., microbes) and the metabolites they produce and consume using the same framework. We propose that applying this framework to a broad range of ecosystems will reveal generalizable principles that can advance our predictive capabilities regarding NOM dynamics.",

However, the effects of population size on trade-offs and ecological specialization remain largely unknown. To complicate matters, trade-offs themselves have been visualized in multiple ways in the literature. Thus, it is not clear how population size can affect the various aspects of trade-offs. To address these issues, we conducted experimental evolution with Escherichia coli populations of two different sizes in two nutritionally limited environments and studied fitness trade-offs from three different perspectives. We found that larger populations evolved greater fitness trade-offs, regardless of how trade-offs are conceptualized. Moreover, although larger populations adapted more to their selection conditions, they also became more maladapted to other environments, ultimately paying heavier costs of adaptation. To enhance the generalizability of our results, we further investigated the evolution of ecological specialization across six different environmental pairs and found that larger populations specialized more frequently and evolved consistently steeper reaction norms of fitness. This is the first study to demonstrate a relationship between population size and fitness trade-offs and the results are important in understanding the population genetics of ecological specialization and vulnerability to environmental changes.",

    "abstract": "After the sudden death of eleven captives marmosets in a rehabilitation center of wildlife in Sao Paulo, Brazil, histological and microbiological study was conducted. Liver, spleen, intestine, central nervous system, lung, thymus, stomach, testicle tissues were analyzed by light microscopy and microbial cultures were conducted. Environmental cultures were also performed. Prophylactic antimicrobial therapy, restricted access to marmosets cages with dedicated staff, and additional sanitization of animals fruits were implemented. Histological findings were compatible with hyperacute septicemia, and microbiological cultures and molecular tests identified the etiologic agent as hypermucoviscous sequence type 86 capsular type K2 K. pneumoniae for the first time in South America. Implementation of prompt containment measures led to successful control of this outbreak. Detection of a hypervirulent and zoonotic pathogen, such as hypermucoviscous K. pneumoniae ST86 K2, in an unexpected and human interface reservoir underscores its potential threat in public health settings.",

    "abstract": "The structural connection between the dorsal premotor (PMd) and the lateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC) has been revealed, in a few studies, as the frontal longitudinal system (FLS). This study conducted a tractography analysis and a limited, postmortem, white-fiber dissection to investigate the superior FLS tract (SFLT) and analyze both its symmetry and termination point patterns. An analysis of spatial location, termination points, laterality, and correlation with the subjects gender or handedness was performed. SFLT was constructed in 100% of right and 88% of left hemispheres. The tracts exhibited variable patterns in different subjects in their posterior terminations. Additionally, the SFLT was found to possess a complex spatial relationship with the adjacent bundles. The SFLT was revealed successfully in two right hemispheres, where the posterior terminations were found to originate in the PMd, and its posterior terminations being totally separate from the superior longitudinal fasciculus.",

However, how mRNA binds to its dedicated channel, and tRNA moves as the mitoribosomal subunit rotate with respect to each other is not understood. We report models of the translating fungal mitoribosome with mRNA, tRNA and nascent polypeptide, as well as an assembly intermediate. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is found in the central protuberance of the large subunit, and the ATPase inhibitory factor 1 (IF1) in the small subunit. The models of the active mitoribosome explain how mRNA binds through a dedicated protein platform on the small subunit, tRNA is translocated with the help of the protein mL108, bridging it with L1 stalk on the large subunit, and nascent polypeptide paths through a newly shaped exit tunnel involving a series of structural rearrangements. An assembly intermediate is modeled with the maturation factor Atp25, providing insight in to the biogenesis of the mitoribosomal large subunit and translation regulation.",

Here, we present Covalent Protein Painting (CPP), a mass spectrometry-based structural proteomics approach to quantify the accessibility of lysine {varepsilon}-amines for chemical modification at the surface of natively folded proteins. We used CPP to survey 2,645 lysine residues in the proteome of HEK293T cells in vivo and found that mild heat shock increased rather than decreased lysine accessibility for chemical modification. CPP was able to differentiate patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) or Lewy body disease (LBD) or both from controls based on relative accessibility of lysine residues K147, K137, and K28 in Tubulin-{beta}, Succinate dehydrogenase, and amyloid-{beta} peptide, respectively. The alterations of Tubulin-{beta} and Succinate dehydrogenase hint to broader perturbations of the proteome in AD beyond amyloid-{beta} and hyper-phosphorylated tau.",

    "abstract": "Physical and chemical technologies have been continuously progressing advances of neuroscience research. The development of research tools for closed-loop control and monitoring neural activities in behaving animals is highly desirable. In this paper, we introduce a wirelessly operated, miniaturized microprobe system for optical interrogation and neurochemical sensing in the deep brain. Via epitaxial liftoff and transfer printing, microscale light emitting diodes (micro-LEDs) as light sources, and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) coated diamond films as electrochemical sensors are vertically assembled to form implantable optoelectrochemical probes, for real-time optogenetic stimulation and dopamine detection capabilities. A customized, lightweight circuit module is employed for untethered, remote signal control and data acquisition. Injected into the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of freely behaving mice, in vivo experiments clearly demonstrate the utilities of the multifunctional optoelectrochemical microprobe system for optogenetic interference of place preferences and detection of dopamine release. The presented options for material and device integrations provide a practical route to simultaneous optical control and electrochemical sensing of complex nervous systems.",

    "abstract": "The cytosolic iron sulfur (Fe-S) assembly (CIA) pathway is required for the insertion of Fe-S clusters into cytosolic and nuclear client proteins, including many DNA metabolism proteins. The molecular mechanisms of client protein recognition and Fe-S cluster transfer remain unknown. Here we report crystal structures of the CIA targeting complex and cryo-EM reconstructions of the complex bound either to the DNA replication factor primase or the DNA helicase DNA2. The structures, combined with biochemical, biophysical and yeast complementation assays, reveal an evolutionarily conserved, bipartite client binding mode facilitated by the structural flexibility of the MMS19 subunit. The primase Fe-S cluster is located [~]70 [A] away from the catalytic cysteine in the CIA targeting complex, pointing to a conformationally dynamic mechanism of Fe-S cluster transfer. Altogether, our studies suggest a model for Fe-S cluster insertion and thus provide a mechanistic framework to understand the biogenesis of critical DNA replication and repair factors.",

However, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine currently. Very recently report had suggested that novel CoV would use the same cell entry receptor, ACE2, as the SARS-CoV. In this report, we generated a novel recombinant protein by connecting the extracellular domain of human ACE2 to the Fc region of the human immunoglobulin IgG1. An ACE2 mutant with low catalytic activity was also used in the study. The fusion proteins were then characterized. Both fusion proteins has high affinity binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV and exerted desired pharmacological properties. Moreover, fusion proteins potently neutralized SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV in vitro. As these fusion proteins exhibit cross-reactivity against coronaviruses, they could have potential applications for diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of 2019-nCoV.",

    "abstract": "Apicomplexan parasites use a specialized cilium structure called the apical complex to organize their secretory organelles and invasion machinery. The apical complex is integrally associated with both the parasite plasma membrane and an intermediate filament cytoskeleton called the inner membrane complex (IMC). While the apical complex is essential to the parasitic lifestyle, little is known about the regulation of apical complex biogenesis. Here, we identify AC9 (apical cap protein 9), a largely intrinsically disordered component of the Toxoplasma gondii IMC, as essential for apical complex development, and therefore for host cell invasion and egress. Parasites lacking AC9 fail to successfully assemble the tubulin-rich core of their apical complex, called the conoid. We use proximity biotinylation to identify the AC9 interaction network, which includes the kinase ERK7. Like AC9, ERK7 is required for apical complex biogenesis. We demonstrate that AC9 directly binds ERK7 through a conserved C-terminal motif and that this interaction is essential for ERK7 localization and function at the apical cap. The crystal structure of the ERK7:AC9 complex reveals that AC9 is not only a scaffold, but also inhibits ERK7 through an unusual set of contacts that displaces nucleotide from the kinase active site. ERK7 is an ancient and auto-activating member of the mitogen-activated kinase family and we have identified its first regulator in any organism. We propose that AC9 dually regulates ERK7 by scaffolding and concentrating it at its site of action while maintaining it in an \"off\" state until the specific binding of a true substrate.\n\nSignificance StatementApicomplexan parasites include the organisms that cause widespread and devastating human diseases such as malaria, cryptosporidiosis, and toxoplasmosis. These parasites are named for a structure, called the \"apical complex,\" that organizes their invasion and secretory machinery. We found that two proteins, apical cap protein 9 (AC9) and an enzyme called ERK7 work together to facilitate apical complex assembly. Intriguingly, ERK7 is an ancient molecule that is found throughout Eukaryota, though its regulation and function are poorly understood. AC9 is a scaffold that concentrates ERK7 at the base of the developing apical complex. In addition, AC9 binding likely confers substrate selectivity upon ERK7. This simple competitive regulatory model may be a powerful but largely overlooked mechanism throughout biology.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe ascending aorta is a common location for aneurysm and dissection. This aortic region is populated by a mosaic of medial and adventitial cells that are embryonically derived from either the second heart field (SHF) or the cardiac neural crest. SHF-derived cells populate areas that coincide with the spatial specificity of thoracic aortopathies. The purpose of this study was to determine whether and how SHF-derived cells contribute to ascending aortopathies.\n\nMethodsAscending aortic pathologies were examined in patients with sporadic thoracic aortopathies and angiotensin II (AngII)-infused mice. Ascending aortas without overt pathology from AngII-infused mice were subjected to mass spectrometry assisted proteomics, and molecular features of SHF-derived cells were determined by single cell transcriptomic analyses. Genetic deletion of either low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (Lrp1) or transforming growth factor-{beta} receptor 2 (Tgfbr2) in SHF- derived cells was conducted to examine the impact of SHF-derived cells on vascular integrity.\n\nResultsPathologies in human ascending aortic aneurysmal tissues were predominant in outer medial layers and adventitia. This gradient was mimicked in mouse aortas following AngII infusion that was coincident with the distribution of SHF-derived cells. Proteomics indicated that brief AngII infusion, prior to overt pathology, evoked downregulation of SMC proteins and differential expression of extracellular matrix proteins, including several LRP1 ligands. LRP1 deletion in SHF-derived cells augmented AngII-induced ascending aortic aneurysm and rupture. Single cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that brief AngII infusion decreased Lrp1 and Tgfbr2 mRNA abundance in SHF-derived cells and induced a unique fibroblast population with low abundance of Tgfbr2 mRNA. SHF-specific Tgfbr2 deletion led to embryonic lethality at E12.5 with dilatation of the outflow tract and retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Integration of proteomic and single cell transcriptomics results identified plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI1) as the most increased protein in SHF-derived SMCs and fibroblasts during AngII infusion. Immunostaining revealed a transmural gradient of PAI1 in both ascending aortas of AngII-infused mice and human ascending aneurysmal aortas that mimicked the gradient of medial and adventitial pathologies.\n\nConclusionSHF-derived cells exert a critical role in maintaining vascular integrity through LRP1 and TGF-{beta} signaling associated with increases of aortic PAI1.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=89 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/930917v6_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (34K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@185e3d9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@131d702org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11afa42org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@242786_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Clinical PerspectiveO_ST_ABSWhat is new?C_ST_ABS- SHF-derived SMCs and fibroblasts associate with AngII-induced aortic pathologies.\n- AngII induces a distinct fibroblast sub-cluster that is less abundant for mRNAs related to major extracellular components and TGF{beta} ligands and receptors, but more abundant for proliferative genes.\n- TGFBR2 deletion in SHF-derived cells are embryonic lethal with significant dilatation of the outflow tract in mice.\n- SHF-specific deletion of LRP1 leads to aortic pathologies in mice, supporting the importance of SHF-derived cells in maintaining ascending aortic wall integrity.\n\n\nWhat are the clinical implications?- Heterogeneity of the embryonic origins of SMCs and fibroblasts contributes to complex mechanisms of vasculopathy formation, which should be considered when investigating the pathogenesis of thoracic aortopathies.",
