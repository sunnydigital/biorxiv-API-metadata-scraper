    "abstract": "BackgroundPrimate-specific Alus contribute to transcriptional novelties in conserved gene regulatory networks. Alu RNAs are present at elevated levels in stress conditions and consequently leads to transcript isoform specific functional role modulating the physiological outcome. One of the possible mechanisms could be Alu nucleated mRNA-miRNA interplay.\n\nResultUsing combination of bioinformatics and experiments, we report a transcript isoform of an orphan gene, CYP20A1 (CYP20A1_Alu-LT) through exaptation of 23 Alus in its 9kb 3UTR. CYP20A1_Alu-LT, confirmed by 3RACE, is an outlier in length and expressed in multiple cell lines. We demonstrate its presence in single nucleus RNA-seq of [~]16000 human cortical neurons (including rosehip neurons). Its expression is restricted to the higher primates. Most strikingly, miRanda predicts [~]4700 miRNA recognition elements (MREs; with threshold< -25kcal/mol) for [~]1000 miRNAs, which have majorly originated within the 3UTR-Alus post exaptation. We hypothesized that differential expression of this transcript could modulate mRNA-miRNA networks and tested it in primary human neurons where CYP20A1_Alu-LT is downregulated during heat shock response and upregulated upon HIV1-Tat treatment. CYP20A1_Alu-LT could possibly function as a miRNA sponge as it exhibits features of a sponge RNA such as cytosolic localization and [&ge;]10 MREs for 140 miRNAs. Small RNA-seq revealed expression of nine miRNAs that can potentially be sponged by CYP20A1_Alu-LT in neurons. Additionally, CYP20A1_Alu-LT expression was positively correlated (low in heat shock and high in Tat) with 380 differentially expressed genes that contain cognate MREs for these nine miRNAs. This set is enriched in genes involved in neuronal development and hemostasis pathways.\n\nConclusionWe demonstrate a potential role for CYP20A1_Alu-LT as miRNA sponge through preferential presence of MREs within Alus in a transcript isoform specific manner. This highlights a novel component of Alu-miRNA mediated transcriptional modulation leading to physiological homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMuscle wasting is a debilitating co-morbidity affecting most advanced cancer patients. Alongside enhanced muscle catabolism, defects in muscle repair/regeneration contribute to cancer-associated wasting. Among the factors implicated in suppression of muscle regeneration are cytokines that interfere with myogenic signal transduction pathways. Less understood is how other cancer/wasting-associated cues, such as metabolites, contribute to muscle dysfunction. This study investigates how the metabolite succinate affects myogenesis and muscle regeneration.\n\nMethodsWe leveraged an established ectopic metabolite treatment (cell permeable dimethyl-succinate) strategy to evaluate the ability of intracellular succinate elevation to 1) affect myoblast homeostasis (proliferation, apoptosis), 2) disrupt protein dynamics and induce wasting-associated atrophy, and 3) modulate in vitro myogenesis. In vivo succinate supplementation experiments (2% succinate, 1% sucrose vehicle) were used to corroborate and extend in vitro observations. Metabolic profiling and functional metabolic studies were then performed to investigate the impact of succinate elevation on mitochondria function.\n\nResultsWe found that in vitro succinate supplementation elevated intracellular succinate about 2-fold, and did not have an impact on proliferation or apoptosis of C2C12 myoblasts. Elevated succinate had minor effects on protein homeostasis ([~]25% decrease in protein synthesis assessed by OPP staining), and no significant effect on myotube atrophy. Succinate elevation interfered with in vitro myoblast differentiation, characterized by significant decreases in late markers of myogenesis and fewer nuclei per myosin heavy chain positive structure (assessed by immunofluorescence staining). While mice orally administered succinate did not exhibit changes in overall body composition or whole muscle weights, these mice displayed smaller muscle myofiber diameters ([~]6% decrease in the mean of non-linear regression curves fit to the histograms of minimum feret diameter distribution), which was exacerbated when muscle regeneration was induced with barium chloride injury. Significant decreases in the mean of non-linear regression curves fit to the histograms of minimum feret diameter distributions were observed 7 days and 28 days post injury. Elevated numbers of myogenin positive cells (3-fold increase) supportive of the differentiation defects observed in vitro were observed 28 days post injury. Metabolic profiling and functional metabolic assessment of myoblasts revealed that succinate elevation caused both widespread metabolic changes and significantly lowered maximal cellular respiration ([~]35% decrease).\n\nConclusionsThis study broadens the repertoire of wasting-associated factors that can directly modulate muscle progenitor cell function and strengthens the hypothesis that metabolic derangements are significant contributors to impaired muscle regeneration, an important aspect of cancer-associated muscle wasting.",

    "abstract": "Spatial attention can be oriented endogenously, based on current task goals, or exogenously, triggered by salient events in the environment. Based upon literature demonstrating differences in the time course and neural substrates of each type of orienting, these two attention systems are often treated as fundamentally distinct. However, recent studies suggest that rhythmic neural activity in the alpha band (8-13Hz) and slow waves in the event-related potential (ERP) may emerge over parietal-occipital cortex following both endogenous and exogenous attention cues. To assess whether these neural changes index common processes of spatial attention, we conducted two within-subject experiments varying the two main dimensions over which endogenous and exogenous attention tasks typically differ: cue informativity (spatially predictive vs. non-predictive) and cue format (centrally vs. peripherally presented). This task design allowed us to tease apart neural changes related to top-down goals and those driven by the reflexive orienting of spatial attention, as well as examine their interactions in a novel hybrid cross-modal attention task. Our data demonstrate that both central and peripheral cues elicit lateralized ERPs over parietal-occipital cortex, though at different points in time, consistent with these ERPs reflecting the orienting of spatial attention. Lateralized alpha activity was also present across all tasks, emerging rapidly for peripheral cues and sustaining only for spatially informative cues. Overall, these data indicate that distinct slow-wave ERPs index the spatial orienting of endogenous and exogenous attention, while lateralized alpha activity represents a common signature of visual enhancement in anticipation of potential targets across both types of attention.",

Images are then computationally processed to obtain three-dimensional structures at atomic resolution. There is increasing interest in extending structural studies by cryo-EM into the cell, where biological structures and processes may be imaged in context. The limited penetrating power of electrons prevents imaging of thick specimens (>500 nm) however. Cryo-sectioning methods employed to overcome this are technically challenging, subject to artefacts or involve specialised equipment of limited availability. Here we describe the first structure of herpesvirus capsids determined by sub-tomogram averaging from nuclei of eukaryotic cells, achieved by cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) of re-vitrified cell sections prepared using the Tokuyasu method. Our reconstructions reveal that the capsid associated tegument complex is present on capsids prior to nuclear egress. We show that this approach to cryogenic imaging of cells is suited to both correlative light/electron microscopy and 3D structure determination.",

    "abstract": "Disorders of bile acids (BAs) are closely related to the development of liver and intestinal diseases, including acute pancreatitis (AP). However, the mechanism underlying the involvement of BAs in AP development remains unclear. We used intraperitoneal injection of cerulein to construct AP mouse models. These mice had significantly reduced tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) and an imbalance of intestinal microbiota, based on 16S rDNA gene sequencing. To explore the role of AP-induced intestinal microbiota changes in the development of AP, we transplanted stool obtained from AP mice to antibiotic-treated, microbiota-depleted healthy mice. Microbiota-depleted mice presented injury to the intestinal barrier function and pancreas. Additionally, microbiota depletion reduced AP-associated pancreatic injury. This indicated that the gut microbiota may worsen AP. As TUDCA was deficient in AP mice, we gavaged AP mice with it, and evaluated subsequent expression changes in the bile acid signaling receptors farnesoid-x-receptor (FXR) and its target gene fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 15. These were downregulated, and pancreatic and intestinal barrier function injury were mitigated. Similar results were found in microbiota-depleted AP without BA treatment. However, we did not observe further downregulation of the FXR signaling pathway in microbiota-depleted AP mice given TUDCA, indicating that improvement of pancreatitis by TUDCA may be associated with gut microbiota. Our analysis of changes to the gut microbiota in AP indicated that Lactobacilli may be the key contributors. Taken together, our study shows that supplementation with BAs could improve bile acid-FXR-FGF15 signaling, and reduce pancreatic and intestinal injury, and that this effect may be associated with the gut microbiota.",

    "abstract": "Background & AimsWNT activation is a hallmark of colorectal cancer. BRAF mutation is present in 15% of colorectal cancers, and the role of mutations in WNT signaling regulators in this context is unclear. Here we evaluate the mutational landscape of WNT signaling regulators in BRAF mutant cancers.\n\nMethodsWe performed exome-sequencing on 24 BRAF mutant colorectal cancers and analysed these data in combination with 175 publicly available BRAF mutant colorectal cancer exomes. We assessed the somatic mutational landscape of WNT signaling regulators, and performed hotspot and driver mutation analyses to identify potential drivers of WNT signaling. The effects of Apc and Braf mutation were modelled, in vivo, using the Apcmin/+ and BrafV637/Villin-CreERT2/+ mouse, respectively.\n\nResultsRNF43 was the most frequently mutated WNT signaling regulator (41%). Mutations in the beta-catenin destruction complex occurred in 48% of cancers. Hotspot analyses identified potential cancer driver genes in the WNT signaling cascade, including MEN1, GNG12 and WNT16. Truncating APC mutation was identified in 20.8% of cancers. Truncating APC mutation was associated with early age at diagnosis (P< 2x10-5), advanced stage (P<0.01), and poor survival (P=0.026). Apcmin/+/BrafV637 animals had more numerous and larger SI and colonic lesions (P<0.0001 and P<0.05, respectively), and a markedly reduced survival (Median survival: 3.2 months, P=8.8x10-21) compared to animals with Apc or Braf mutation alone.\n\nConclusionsThe WNT signaling axis is frequently mutated in BRAF mutant colorectal cancers. WNT16 and MEN1 may be novel drivers of aberrant WNT signaling in colorectal cancer. Co-mutation of BRAF and APC generates an extremely aggressive neoplastic phenotype that is associated with poor patient outcome.\n\nSynopsisWe have comprehensively evaluated the somatic mutation landscape of WNT signaling regulators in serrated colorectal cancers. We identified a mosaic of mutations that may be responsible for elevating WNT signaling in this context. Approximately 20% of serrated colorectal cancers harbor truncating APC mutation, and these cancers confer extremely poor prognoses.",

    "abstract": "The cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR), also known as the IGF2 receptor or CD222, is a multifunctional type I transmembrane glycoprotein ubiquitously expressed in most eukaryotic cell types. Through the receptors ability to bind a variety of unrelated extracellular and intracellular ligands, it is involved in a wide array of functions including protein trafficking, lysosomal biogenesis, internalization, regulation of cell growth, cell migration and apoptosis. CI-MPR has a large extracellular region comprised of 15 contiguous domains, four of which interact with phosphorylated glycans on lysosomal enzymes. Here we present a series of biophysical studies, along with crystal structures, providing information on how the N-terminal 5 domains of this receptor work in concert to bind and release carbohydrates. High-resolution electron microscopy as well as hydroxyl radical protein footprinting (HRPF) of this multifunctional multidomain construct demonstrates dynamic conformational changes occur as a consequence of ligand binding and different pH conditions, These data, coupled with surface plasmon resonance studies and molecular modeling, allow us to propose a bi-dentate oligosaccharide binding model, which could explain how high affinity carbohydrate binding is achieved through allosteric domain cooperativity.",

    "abstract": "Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are central to development as they are the precursors of all cell types in the embryo. Therefore, maintaining a stable karyotype is essential, both for their physiological role as well as for use in regenerative medicine. In culture, an estimated 10-30% of PSC lines present karyotypic abnormalities, but the underlying causes remain unknown. To gain insight into the mitotic capacity of human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, we explore the structure of the centromere and kinetochore. Centromere function depends on CENP-A nucleosome-defined chromatin. We show that while PSCs maintain abundant pools of CENP-A, CENP-C and CENP-T, these essential centromere components are strongly reduced at stem cell centromeres. Outer kinetochore recruitment is also impaired to a lesser extent, indicating an overall weaker kinetochore. This impairment is specific for the kinetochore forming centromere complex while the inner centromere protein Aurora B remains unaffected. We further show that, similar to differentiated human cells, CENP-A chromatin assembly in PSCs requires transition into G1 phase. Finally, reprogramming experiments indicate that reduction of centromeric CENP-A levels is an early event during dedifferentiation, coinciding with global chromatin remodelling. Our characterisation of centromeres in human stem cells drives new hypotheses including a possible link between impaired centromere function and stem cell aneuploidies.",

    "abstract": "Holometabolous insects undergo a complete transformation of the body plan from the larval to the adult stage. In Drosophila, this transformation includes replacement of larval epidermal cells (LECs) by adult epidermal cells (AECs). AECs in Drosophila undergo a rapid and stereotyped aging program where they lose both cell membranes and nuclei. Whether LECs are capable of undergoing aging in a manner similar to AECs remains unknown. Here, we address this question in two ways. First, we looked for hallmarks of epidermal aging in larvae that have a greatly extended third instar and/or carry mutations that would cause premature epidermal aging at the adult stage. Such larvae, irrespective of genotype, did not show any of the signs of epidermal aging observed in the adult. Second, we developed a procedure to effect a heterochronic persistence of LECs into the adult epidermal sheet. LECs embedded within the adult epidermal sheet undergo clear signs of epidermal aging; they form multinucleate cells with each other and with the surrounding AECs on the same schedule as the AECs themselves. Our data reveals that epidermal aging in holometabolous Drosophila is a stage-specific phenomenon and that the capacity of LECs to respond to aging signals does exist.\n\nSummary StatementWe show that Drosophila larval epidermal cells do not age at the larval stage. They do, however, exhibit signs of aging if they persist into the adult.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction is a facet of many age-related neurodegenerative diseases, yet its role in disease etiology remains poorly understood1. We recently discovered a potential causal link between the branched-chain amino acid transferase, BCAT-1, and the neurodegenerative movement disorder, Parkinsons disease (PD)2. Knockdown of C. elegans bcat-1 recapitulates PD-like features, including progressive motor deficits and neurodegeneration with age2. Using transcriptomic, metabolomic, and imaging approaches, we show that bcat-1 knockdown increases mitochondrial activity and induces oxidative damage in neurons through mTOR-independent mechanisms. We recently developed a high-throughput screening platform to identify drugs that may be repurposed for PD, and found that metformin, the leading type 2 diabetes medication, significantly improves motor function in bcat-1(RNAi) worms3. Late-in-life metformin treatment restores normal mitochondrial activity levels and protects against bcat-1-associated neurodegeneration. Our results suggest that PD may originate as a metabolic disorder, and highlight metformin as a promising new drug candidate for PD treatment.",

Yet, the molecular mechanisms whereby large, light scattering aggregates form is poorly understood, because of the complexity of the aggregates isolated from human lenses. The predominant proteins in the lens are structural proteins called crystallins. The {gamma}S-crystallin is heavily modified in cataractous lenses by deamidation, which introduces a negative charge at labile asparagine residues. The effects of deamidation at asparagines, N14, N76, and N143, were mimicked by replacing the asparagine with aspartate using site-directed mutagenesis. The effects of these surface deamidations on the stability, unfolding, and aggregation properties of {gamma}S were determined using dynamic light scattering, chemical and thermal-denaturation, and hydrogen-deuterium exchange with mass spectrometry. We found that a small population of all the deamidation mimics aggregated directly into large light scattering bodies with a radius greater than 10 nm that contributed 14-60% of the total scattering intensity compared to 7% for WT under the same conditions. A possible mechanism was identified under partially denaturing conditions, where deamidation led to significantly more rapid unfolding and aggregation particularly for N76D compared to WT. The triple mutant was further destabilized, reflecting the enhanced aggregation properties of N14D and N143D. Thus, the effects of deamidation were both site-specific and cumulative. A-crystallin was ineffective at acting as a chaperone to prevent the aggregation of destabilized, deamidated {gamma}S. It is concluded that surface deamidations, while causing minimal structural disruption individually, progressively destabilize crystallin proteins, leading to their unfolding and precipitation in aged and cataractous lenses.",

    "abstract": "Cell proliferation and survival require continuous ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis. Genes encoding ribosomal RNA (rRNA) are physically located in a specialized substructure within the nucleus known as the nucleolus, which has a central role in the biogenesis of ribosomes. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) was previously detected in the nucleus. However, its role there is elusive. Herein we report that MMP-2 resides within the nucleolus to regulate rRNA transcription. MMP-2 is enriched at the promoter region of rRNA gene repeats and its inhibition downregulates pre-rRNA transcription. The N-terminal tail of histone H3 is clipped by MMP-2 in the nucleolus and is associated with increased rRNA transcription. Knocking down/out MMP-2 or inhibiting its activity prevents histone H3 cleavage and reduces both rRNA transcription and cell proliferation. In addition to the known extracellular roles of MMP-2 in tumor growth, our data reveal an epigenetic mechanism whereby intranucleolar MMP-2 regulates cell proliferation through histone proteolysis and facilitation of rRNA transcription.",

We recently reported increased microRNA-31-5p (miR-31-5p) expression in colonic IECs of CD patients, but downstream targets are unknown.\n\nDesignMiR-31-5p target genes were identified by integrative analysis of RNA- and small RNA-sequencing data from colonic mucosa and confirmed by qPCR in colonic IECs. Functional characterization of Activin Receptor-Like Kinase 1 (ACVRL1 or ALK1) in IECs was performed ex vivo using 2 dimensional-cultured human primary colonic IECs. The impact of altered colonic ALK1 signaling in CD for the risk of surgery and endoscopic relapse was evaluated by a multivariate regression analysis and a Kaplan-Meier estimator.\n\nResultsALK1 was identified as a target of miR-31-5p in colonic IECs of CD patients and confirmed using a 3-UTR reporter assay. Activation of ALK1 restricted the proliferation of colonic IECs in an EdU proliferation assay and down-regulated the expression of stemness-related genes. Activated ALK1 signaling directed the fate of colonic IEC differentiation toward colonocytes. Down-regulated ALK1 signaling was associated with increased stemness and decreased colonocyte-specific marker expression in colonic IECs of CD patients compared to healthy controls. Activation of ALK1 enhanced epithelial barrier integrity in a trans-epithelial electrical resistance permeability assay. Lower colonic ALK1 expression was identified as an independent risk factor for surgery and associated with a higher risk of endoscopic relapse in CD patients.\n\nConclusionDecreased colonic ALK1 disrupted colonic IEC barrier integrity and associated with deteriorated clinical outcomes in CD patients.",

    "abstract": "Meiosis in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is used to create haploid yeast spores from a diploid mother cell. During meiosis II, cytokinesis occurs by closure of the prospore membrane, a membrane that initiates at the spindle pole body and grows to surround each of the haploid meiotic products. Timely prospore membrane closure requires SPS1, which encodes a STE20-family GCKIII kinase. To identify genes that may activate SPS1, we utilized a histone phosphorylation defect of sps1 mutants to screen for genes with a similar phenotype and found that cdc15 shared this phenotype. CDC15 encodes a Hippo-like kinase that is part of the mitotic exit network. We find that Sps1 complexes with Cdc15, that Sps1 phosphorylation requires Cdc15, and that CDC15 is also required for timely prospore membrane closure. We also find that SPS1, like CDC15, is required for meiosis II spindle disassembly and sustained anaphase II release of Cdc14 in meiosis. However, the NDR-kinase complex encoded by DBF2/DBF20 MOB1 which functions downstream of CDC15 in mitotic cells, does not appear to play a role in spindle disassembly, timely prospore membrane closure, or sustained anaphase II Cdc14 release. Taken together, our results suggest that the mitotic exit network is rewired for exit from meiosis II, such that SPS1 replaces the NDR-kinase complex downstream of CDC15.",

    "abstract": "The linkage, length, and architecture of ubiquitin (Ub) chains are all important variables in providing tight control over many biological paradigms. There are clear roles for branched architectures in regulating proteasome-mediated degradation, however the proteins that selectively recognize and process these atypical chains are unknown. Here, using synthetic and enzyme-derived ubiquitin chains along with intact mass spectrometry, we report that UCH37/UCHL5, a proteasome-associated deubiquitinase, exclusively cleaves K48 branched chains. The activity and selectivity toward branched chains is markedly enhanced by the proteasomal Ub receptor RPN13/ADRM1. Using proteasome complexes reconstituted with either active or inactive UCH37 together with protein substrates modified with branched chains, we find that chain debranching promotes degradation under multi-turnover conditions. These results are further supported by proteome-wide pulse-chase experiments, which show that the loss of UCH37 activity impairs global protein turnover. Our work therefore defines UCH37 as a debranching deubiquitinase important for promoting proteasomal degradation.",

    "abstract": "Branched-chain -keto acids (BCKAs) are downstream catabolites of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). Mitochondrial oxidation of BCKAs is catalyzed by branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH), an enzyme sensitive to inhibitory phosphorylation by BCKD kinase (BCKDK). Emerging studies show that defective BCAA catabolism and elevated BCKAs levels correlate with glucose intolerance and cardiac dysfunction. However, if/how BCKDH and BCKDK exert control on the availability and flux of intramyocellular BCKAs and if BCKA reprograms nutrient metabolism by influencing insulin action remains unexplored. We observed altered BCAA catabolizing enzyme expression in the murine heart and skeletal muscle during physiological fasting and diet-induced obesity and after ex vivo exposure of C2C12 cells to increasing concentration of saturated fatty acid, palmitate. BCKAs per se impaired insulin-induced AKT phosphorylation and AKT activity in skeletal myotubes and cardiomyocytes. In skeletal muscle cells, mTORC1 and protein translation signaling was enhanced by BCKA with concomitant suppression of mitochondrial respiration. Lowering intracellular BCKA levels by genetic and pharmacological activation of BCKDHA enhanced insulin signaling and activated pyruvate dehydrogenase, an effector of glucose oxidation and substrate metabolism. Our findings suggest that BCKAs profoundly influence muscle insulin function, providing new insight into the molecular nexus of BCAA metabolism and signaling with cellular insulin action and respiration.",

    "abstract": "The derivation of self-renewing tissue-specific stem cells from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) would shorten the time needed to engineer mature cell types in vitro and would have broad reaching implications for the field of regenerative medicine. Here we report the directed differentiation of human iPSCs into putative airway basal cells (\"iBCs\"), a population resembling the epithelial stem cell of lung airways. Using a dual fluorescent reporter system (NKX2-1GFP;TP63tdTomato) we track and purify these cells over time, as they first emerge from iPSC-derived foregut endoderm as developmentally immature NKX2-1GFP+ lung progenitors which then augment a TP63 program during subsequent proximal airway epithelial patterning. These cells clonally proliferate, initially as NKX2-1GFP+/TP63tdTomato+ immature airway progenitors that lack expression of the adult basal cell surface marker NGFR. However, in response to primary basal cell medium, NKX2-1GFP+/ TP63tdTomato+ cells upregulate NGFR and display the molecular and functional phenotype of airway basal stem cells, including the capacity to clonally self-renew or undergo multilineage ciliated and secretory epithelial differentiation in air-liquid interface cultures. iBCs and their differentiated progeny recapitulate several fundamental physiologic features of normal primary airway epithelial cells and model perturbations that characterize acquired and genetic airway diseases. In an asthma model of mucus metaplasia, the inflammatory cytokine IL-13 induced an increase in MUC5AC+ cells similar to primary cells. CFTR-dependent chloride flux in airway epithelium generated from cystic fibrosis iBCs or their syngeneic CFTR-corrected controls exhibited a pattern consistent with the flux measured in primary diseased and normal human airway epithelium, respectively. Finally, multiciliated cells generated from an individual with primary ciliary dyskinesia recapitulated the ciliary beat and ultrastructural defects observed in the donor. Thus, we demonstrate the successful de novo generation of a tissue-resident stem cell-like population in vitro from iPSCs, an approach which should facilitate disease modeling and future regenerative therapies for a variety of diseases affecting the lung airways.",

    "abstract": "MotivationQuality control (QC) is a critical step in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis. Low-quality cells are removed from the analysis during the QC process to avoid misinterpretation of the data. One of the important QC metrics is the mitochondrial proportion (mtDNA%), which is used as a threshold to filter out low-quality cells. Early publications in the field established a threshold of 5% and since then, it has been used as a default in several software packages for scRNA-seq data analysis and adopted as a standard in many scRNA-seq studies. However, the validity of using a uniform threshold across different species, single-cell technologies, tissues, and cell types has not been adequately assessed.\n\nResultsWe systematically analyzed 5,530,106 cells reported in 1,349 annotated datasets available in the PanglaoDB database and found that the average mtDNA% in scRNA-seq data across human tissues is significantly higher than in mouse tissues. This difference is not confounded by the platform used to generate the data. Based on this finding, we propose new reference values of the mtDNA% for 121 tissues of mice and 44 tissues of humans. In general, for mouse tissues, the 5% threshold performs well to distinguish between healthy and low-quality cells. However, for human tissues, the 5% threshold should be reconsidered as it fails to accurately discriminate between healthy and low-quality cells in 29.5% (13 of 44) tissues analyzed. We conclude that omitting the mtDNA% QC filter or adopting a suboptimal mtDNA% threshold may lead to erroneous biological interpretations of scRNA-seq data.\n\nAvailabilityThe code used to download datasets, perform the analyzes, and produce the figures is available at https://github.com/dosorio/mtProportion\n\nContactdcosorioh@tamu.edu\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

However, the positive rate is only 30-50%. Currently, fluorescent quantitative RT-PCR technology is mainly used to detect 2019-nCoV. According to \"The Laboratory Technical Guidelines for Detection 2019-nCoV (Fourth Edition)\" issued by National Health and Commission of China and \"The Experts Consensus on Nucleic Acid Detection of 2019-nCoV\" released by Chinese Society of Laboratory Medicine, the human samples must be placed under 56{degrees}C or higher to inactivate the viruses in order to keep the inspectors from virus infection before the nucleic acids were isolated as the template of qRT-PCR. In this study, we demonstrated that the virus inactivation treatment disrupts its genome integrity seriously when using porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (vaccine), a kind of coronavirus, as a model. Our results showed that only 50.11% of the detectable viral templates left after the inactivation of 56 {degrees}C for 30 minutes and only 3.36% left after the inactivation of 92 {degrees}C for 5 minutes when the samples were preserved by Hanks solution, one of an isotonic salt solutions currently suggested. However, the detectable templates of viral nucleic acids can be unchanged after the samples were incubated at 56 {degrees}C or higher if the samples were preserved with an optimized solution to protect the RNA from being disrupted. We therefore highly recommend to carry out systematic investigation on the impact of high temperature inactivation on the integrity of 2019-nCoV genome and develop a sample preservation solution to protect the detectable templates of 2019-nCoV nucleic acids from high temperature inactivation damage.",

    "abstract": "Nanoscale membrane curvature is now understood to play an active role in essential cellular processes such as endocytosis, exocytosis and actin dynamics. Previous studies have shown that membrane curvatures directly affect protein functions and intracellular signaling. However, few methods are able to precisely manipulate membrane curvature in live cells. Here, we report the development of a new method of generating nanoscale membrane curvature in live cells that is controllable, reversible, and capable of precise spatial and temporal manipulation. For this purpose, we make use of BAR domain proteins, a family of well-studied membrane-remodeling and membrane-sculpting proteins. Specifically, we engineered two optogenetic systems, opto-FBAR and opto-IBAR, that allow light-inducible formation of positive and negative membrane curvature respectively. Using opto-FBAR, blue light activation results in the formation of tubular membrane invaginations (positive curvature), controllable down to the subcellular level. Using opto-IBAR, blue light illumination results in the formation of membrane protrusions or filopodia (negative curvature). These systems present a novel approach for light-inducible manipulation of nanoscale membrane curvature in live cells.\n\nHighlightsO_LIOpto-FBAR enables light-inducible positive membrane curvature formation.\nC_LIO_LIOpto-IBAR enables light-inducible negative membrane curvature formation.\nC_LIO_LILight-inducible activation enables precise spatial and temporal control.\nC_LIO_LIOpto-BAR systems present a new approach for studying membranes in live cells.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Multiple nuclei sharing a common cytoplasm are found in diverse tissues, organisms, and diseases. Yet, multinucleation remains a poorly understood biological property. Cytoplasm sharing invariably involves plasma membrane breaches. In contrast, we discovered cytoplasm sharing without membrane breaching in highly resorptive Drosophila rectal papillae. During a six-hour developmental window, 100 individual papillar cells assemble a multinucleate cytoplasm, allowing passage of proteins of at least 27kDa throughout papillar tissue. Papillar cytoplasm sharing does not employ canonical mechanisms such as failed cytokinesis or muscle fusion pore regulators. Instead, sharing requires gap junction proteins (normally associated with transport of molecules <1kDa), which are positioned by membrane remodeling GTPases. Our work reveals a new role for apical membrane remodeling in converting a multicellular epithelium into a giant multinucleate cytoplasm.\n\nONE SENTENCE SUMMARYApical membrane remodeling in a resorptive Drosophila epithelium generates a shared multinuclear cytoplasm.",

    "abstract": "Familial forms of neurodegenerative diseases commonly involve mutation of aggregation-prone proteins or components of the protein degradation machinery that act on aberrant proteins. Ubqln2 encodes a member of the UBL/UBA family of proteasome shuttle factors that is thought to facilitate proteasomal degradation of substrates, and mutation of this gene results in a familial form of ALS/FTD in humans. How Ubqln2 dysfunction leads to neurodegeneration, however, remains uncertain. We undertook a comprehensive study to identify proteomic changes upon Ubqln2 perturbation in multiple murine models of Ubqln2-mediated neurodegenerative disease. By performing quantitative multiplexed proteomics on neural tissues of affected animals, we identified a small group of proteins whose abundance is tightly linked to UBQLN2 function: the ubiquitin ligase TRIM32 and two retroelement-derived proteins, PEG10 and CXX1B. Further studies using cultured cells of human origin, including induced neurons, found similar changes in protein abundance upon Ubqln2 loss, and pulse-chase studies suggested that PEG10 and TRIM32 are direct clients of UBQLN2. In conclusion, our study provides a deep understanding of the proteomic landscape of ALS-related Ubqln2 mutants and identifies candidate client proteins that are altered in vivo in disease models and whose degradation is promoted by UBQLN2.",

    "abstract": "Vertebrate skeletal muscles are composed of both slow-twitch and fast-twitch fiber types. How the differentiation of distinct fiber types is activated during embryogenesis is not well characterized. Skeletal muscle differentiation is initiated by the activity of the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors Myf5, Myod1, Myf6, and Myog. Myod1 functions as a muscle master regulatory factor and directly activates muscle differentiation genes, including those specific to both slow and fast muscle fibers. Our previous studies showed that Pbx TALE-class homeodomain proteins bind with Myod1 on the promoter of the zebrafish fast muscle gene mylpfa and are required for proper activation of mylpfa expression and the fast-twitch muscle-specific differentiation program in zebrafish embryos. Pbx proteins have also been shown to bind regulatory regions of muscle differentiation genes in mammalian muscle cells in culture. Here, we use new zebrafish mutant strains to confirm the essential roles of zebrafish Pbx factors in embryonic fast muscle differentiation. Furthermore, we examine the requirements for Pbx genes in mouse embryonic skeletal muscle differentiation, an area that has not been investigated in the mammalian embryo. Removing Pbx1 function from skeletal muscle in Myf5Cre/+;Pbx1fl/fl mouse embryos has minor effects on embryonic muscle development. However, concomitantly deleting Pbx2 function in Myf5Cre/+;Pbx1fl/fl;Pbx2-/- mouse embryos causes delayed activation and reduced expression of fast muscle differentiation genes. In the mouse, Pbx1/Pbx2-dependent fast muscle genes closely match those that have been previously shown to be dependent on murine Six1 and Six4. This work establishes evolutionarily conserved requirements for Pbx factors in embryonic fast muscle differentiation. Our studies are revealing how Pbx homeodomain proteins help direct specific cellular differentiation pathways.",

    "abstract": "ER-to-Golgi transport is the first step in the constitutive secretory pathway which, unlike regulated secretion, is believed to proceed non-stop regardless of Ca2+ flux. Rowever, here we demonstrate that penta-EF hand (PEF) proteins ALG-2 and peflin constitute a hetero-bifunctional COPII regulator that responds to Ca2+ signaling by adjusting the ER export rate of COPII-sorted cargos up or down by ~50%. At steady-state Ca2+, ALG-2/peflin hetero-complexes bind to ER exit sites (ERES) through the ALG-2 subunit to confer a low, buffered secretion rate, while peflin-lacking ALG-2 complexes markedly stimulate secretion. During Ca2+ signaling, ALG-2 complexes lacking peflin can either increase or decrease the secretion rate depending on signaling intensity and duration-phenomena that could contribute to cellular growth and intercellular communication, following secretory increases, or protection from excitotoxicity and infection following decreases. In epithelial normal rat kidney (NRK) cells, the Ca2+-mobilizing agonist ATP causes ALG-2 to depress ER export, while in neuroendocrine PC12 cells, Ca2+ mobilization by ATP results in ALG-2-dependent enhancement of secretion. Within the NRK cell model, distinct Ca2+ signaling patterns can produce opposing ALG-2-dependent effects on secretion. Mechanistically, ALG-2-dependent depression of secretion involves decreased COPTT outer shell and increased peflin targeting to ERES, while ALG-2-dependent enhancement of secretion involves increased COPTT outer shell and decreased peflin at ERES. PEF protein complexes represent a true regulator of transport as they are dispensable for secretion yet adjust the secretion rate to physiological conditions. Their dynamics affects secretion of important physiological cargoes such as collagen T and significantly impacts ER stress.",

    "abstract": "The shape of many eukaryotic cells depends on the actin cytoskeleton; and localized changes in actin assembly dynamics underlie many changes in cell shape. Polymerases of the Ena/VASP family modulate cell shape by locally accelerating actin filament assembly and slowing filament capping. When concentrated into discrete foci at the leading edge, VASP promotes formation of filopodia, but the mechanisms that drive VASP clustering are poorly understood. Here we show that, in migrating B16F1 cells, VASP molecules assemble on pre-existing foci of the adaptor protein, lamellipodin, and that dimerization of lamellipodin is essential for cluster formation. VASP/lamellipodin clusters grow by accumulating monomers and by fusing, but their growth is limited by a previously undescribed, size-dependent instability. Our results demonstrate that assembly and disassembly dynamics of filopodia tip complexes are determined, in part, by a network of multivalent interactions between VASP, lamellipodin, and actin.",

    "abstract": "Rab GTPases are molecular switches that regulate membrane trafficking in all cells. Neurons have particular demands on membrane trafficking and express numerous Rab GTPases of unknown function. Here we report the generation and characterization of molecularly defined null mutants for all 26 rab genes in Drosophila. In addition, we created a transgenic fly collection for the acute, synchronous release system RUSH for all 26 Rabs. In flies, all rab genes are expressed in the nervous system where at least half exhibit particularly high levels compared to other tissues. Surprisingly, loss of any of these 13 nervous-system enriched Rabs yields viable and fertile flies without obvious morphological defects. However, 9 of these 13 affect either developmental timing when challenged with different temperatures, or neuronal function when challenged with continuous stimulation. These defects are non-lethal under laboratory conditions, but represent sensitized genetic backgrounds that reveal limits of developmental and functional robustness to environmental challenges. Interestingly, the neuronal rab26 was previously proposed to function in synaptic maintenance by linking autophagy and synaptic vesicle recycling and we identified rab26 as one of six rab mutants with reduced synaptic function under continuous stimulation conditions. However, we found no changes to autophagy or synaptic vesicle markers in the rab26 mutant, but instead a cell-specific role in membrane receptor turnover associated with cholinergic synapses in the fly visual system. Our systematic functional analyses suggest that several Rabs ensure robust development and function under varying environmental conditions. The mutant and transgenic fly collections generated in this study provide a basis for further studies of Rabs during development and homeostasis in vivo.",
