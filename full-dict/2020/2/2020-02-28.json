    "abstract": "The roles of CD4+ T helper cells (TH) in shaping localized memory B and CD8+ T cell immunity in the mucosal tissues are largely unexplored. Here, we report that lung TH cells provide local assistance for the optimal development of tissue-resident memory B (BRM) and CD8+ T (TRM) cells following the resolution of primary influenza virus infection. We identify a population of tissue-resident CD4+ TH (aka TRH) cells that co-exhibit follicular T helper (TFH) and TRM cell features and mediate local help of CD4+ T cells to B and CD8+ T cells. Optimal TRH cell formation requires lung B cells and transcription factors involved in TFH or TRM development. Further, we show that TRH cells deliver local help to B and CD8 T cells through CD40L and IL-21-dependent mechanisms. Our data have uncovered a new tissue-resident TH cell population that is specialized in assisting the development of mucosal protective B and CD8+ T cell responses in situ.",

    "abstract": "Anopheles gambiae and Aedes aegypti are perhaps the best studied mosquito species and important carriers of human malaria and arbovirus, respectively. Mosquitoes have daily rhythms in behaviors and show a wide range of activity patterns. Although Anopheles is known to be principally nocturnal and Aedes principally diurnal, details of mosquito activity are not easily assayed in the laboratory. We recently described FlyBox, a simple tracking system for assaying Drosophila locomotor activity rhythms and thought that it might also be applicable to monitoring mosquito activity. Indeed, we show here that FlyBox can easily, conveniently, affordably and accurately measure the activity of Anopheles as well as Aedes over several days. The resulting profiles under light-dark as well as constant darkness conditions are compatible with results in the literature, indicating that this or similar systems will be useful in the future for more detailed studies on a range of insect species and under more diverse laboratory conditions.",

CLR-RAMP complexes are drug targets, but short AM and CGRP plasma half-lives limit their therapeutic utility. We used combinatorial peptide library and rational design approaches to probe selectivity determinants and develop short AM and CGRP variants with [~]1000-fold increased receptor extracellular domain affinities. Binding and structural studies explained the increased affinities and defined roles for AM Lys46 and RAMP modulation of CLR conformation in selectivity. In longer scaffolds that also bind the CLR transmembrane domain the variants generated picomolar affinity antagonists, one with an estimated 12.5 hr CGRP receptor residence time, and sustained signaling agonists ss-AM and ss-CGRP. This work clarifies the RAMP-modulated ligand selectivity mechanism and provides AM and CGRP variants with promise as long-acting therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "T cell receptor repertoire inference from DNA and RNA sequencing experiments is frequently performed to characterize host immune responses to disease states. Existing tools for repertoire inference have been compared across publicly available biological datasets or unpublished simulated sequencing data. Evaluation and comparison of these tools is challenging without common data sets created from a known repertoire with well-defined biological and sequencing characteristics. Here we introduce STIG, a tool to create simulated T cell receptor sequencing data from a customizable virtual T cell repertoire, with clear attribution of individual reads back to locations within their respective T-cell receptor clonotypes. STIG allows for robust performance evaluation of T cell repertoire inference and downstream analysis methods. STIG is implemented in Python 3 and is freely available for download at https://github.com/Benjamin-Vincent-Lab/stig\n\nAuthor summaryAs part of the acquired immune system, T cells are integral in the host response to microbes, tumors and autoimmune disease. These cells each have a semi-unique T cell receptor that serves to bind a set of antigens that will in turn stimulate that cell to perform its particular pro- (or anti) inflammatory role. This receptor is the product of DNA rearrangement of germline gene segments, similar to B cell receptor loci rearrangement, which provides a wide variety of potential T cell receptors to respond to antigens. At the site of an immune reaction, T cells can increase their number through clonal expansion and methods have been developed to analyze bulk genetic sequencing data to infer the individual receptors and the relative size of their clonal subpopulations present within a sample. To date, these methods and tools have been tested and compared using either biological samples (where the true quantitiy and types of T cells is unknown) or unshared synthetic datasets. In this paper I describe a new tool to generate biologically-inspired T-cell repertoires in-silico and generate simulated sequencing data from them.",

    "abstract": "Bone marrow stroma influences metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) progression, latency, and recurrence. At sites of PCa bone metastasis, cancer-associated fibroblasts and tumor-associated macrophages interact to establish a perlecan-rich desmoplastic stroma. As a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, perlecan (HSPG2) stores and stabilizes growth factors, including heparin-binding Wnt3A, a positive regulator of PCa cell growth. Because PCa cells alone do not induce CAF production of perlecan in the desmoplastic stroma, we sought to discover the sources of perlecan and its growth factor-releasing modifiers SULF1, SULF2, and heparanase in PCa cells and xenografts, bone marrow fibroblasts, and macrophages. SULF1, produced primarily by bone marrow fibroblasts, was the main glycosaminoglycanase present, a finding validated with primary tissue specimens of PCa metastases with desmoplastic bone stroma. Expression of both HSPG2 and SULF1 was concentrated in SMA-rich stroma near PCa tumor nests, where infiltrating pro-tumor TAMs also were present. To decipher SULF1s role in the reactive bone stroma, we created a bone marrow biomimetic hydrogel incorporating perlecan, PCa cells, macrophages, and fibroblastic bone marrow stromal cells. Finding that M2-like macrophages increased levels of SULF1 and HSPG2 produced by fibroblasts, we examined SULF1 function in Wnt3A-mediated PCa tumoroid growth in tricultures. Comparing control or SULF1 knockout fibroblastic cells, we showed that SULF1 reduces Wnt3A-driven growth, cellularity, and cluster number of PCa cells in our 3D model. We conclude that SULF1 can suppress Wnt3A-driven growth signals in the desmoplastic stroma of PCa bone metastases, and SULF1 loss favors PCa progression, even in the presence of pro-tumorigenic TAMs.",

    "abstract": "Radiology based classification of glioma independent of histological or genetic markers predicting survival of patients is an unmet need. Until now radiology is chasing these markers rather than focussing directly on the clinical outcome. Our study is first of its kind to come up with the independent new radiological classification of gliomas encompassing both low-and high-grade gliomas under single classification system.\n\nTCGA-LGG and REMBRANDT public domain dataset of glioma were analyzed as training and testing dataset respectively. Based on MRI images, gliomas were classified into six types in detailed classification & three types in simplified classification system. Survival analysis using Kaplan Meier and Cox regression was done. Secondary objective was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of novel signs with existing histological and genetic markers.\n\nThe study predicted survival in both training and testing dataset independent of genetic or histological information. Novel signs, \"Ball on Christmas tree\" sign(highly specific), Type-4 lineage sign(highly sensitive) identifies IDH-wild and high-grade gliomas (grade-III and IV) while Type-2 lineage sign showed good specificity in identifying 1p19q non co-deleted IDH-mutated, ATRX del/mutated, Grade-II gliomas. There is a substantial interobserver agreement for the classification and novel signs. New radiological classification of glioma predicts the survival of patients independent of genetic or histological information. This can act as a scaffolding to formulate and streamline the treatment guidelines for glioma patients. This classification has potential of improving the quality of care of glioma patients by predicting the survival without the need of invasive biopsy.",

    "abstract": "The GTPase KRas is a signaling protein in networks for cell differentiation, growth, and division. KRas mutations can prolong activation of these networks, resulting in tumor formation. When active, KRas tightly binds GTP. Several oncogenic mutations affect the conversion between this rigid state and inactive, more flexible states. Detailed understanding of these transitions may provide valuable insights into how mutations affect KRas. Path sampling simulations, which focus on transitions, show KRas visiting several states, which are the same for wild type and the oncogenic mutant Q61L. Large differences occur when converting between these states, indicating the dramatic effect of the Q61L mutation on KRas dynamics. For Q61L a route to the flexible state is inaccessible, thus shifting the equilibrium to more rigid states. Our methodology presents a novel way to predict dynamical effects of KRas mutations, which may aid in identifying potential therapeutic targets.\n\nAuthor summaryCancer cells frequently contain mutations in the protein KRas. However, KRas is a challenging target for anti-cancer drugs, in part because the dynamic behavior of flexible regions in the protein is difficult to characterize experimentally, and occurs on timescales that are too long for straightforward molecular dynamics simulations. We have used path sampling, an advanced simulation technique that overcomes long timescales, to obtain atomistic insight into the dynamics of KRas. Comparing the oncogenic mutant Q61L to the wild type revealed that the mutation closes off one transition channel for deactivating KRas. Our approach opens up the way for predicting the dynamical effects of mutations in KRas, which may aid in identifying potential therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Population stratification is a strong confounding factor in human genetic association studies. In analyses of rare variants, the main correction strategies based on principal components (PC) and linear mixed models (LMM), may yield conflicting conclusions, due to both the specific type of structure induced by rare variants and the particular statistical features of association tests. Studies evaluating these approaches generally focused on specific situations with limited types of simulated structure and large sample sizes. We investigated the properties of several correction methods in the context of a large simulation study using real exome data, and several within- and between- continent stratification scenarios. We also considered different sample sizes, with situations including as few as 50 cases, to account for the analysis of rare disorders. In this context, we focused on a genetic model with a phenotype driven by rare deleterious variants well suited for a burden test. For analyses of large samples, we found that accounting for stratification was more difficult with a continental structure than with a worldwide structure. LMM failed to maintain a correct type I error in many scenarios, whereas PCs based on common variants failed only in the presence of extreme continental stratification. When a sample of 50 cases was considered, an inflation of type I errors was observed with PC for small numbers of controls ([&le;]100), and with LMM for large numbers of controls ([&ge;]1000). We also tested a promising novel adapted local permutation method (LocPerm), which maintained a correct type I error in all situations. All approaches capable of correcting for stratification properly had similar powers for detecting actual associations pointing out that the key issue is to properly control type I errors. Finally, we found that adding a large panel of external controls (e.g. extracted from publicly available databases) was an efficient way to increase the power of analyses including small numbers of cases, provided an appropriate stratification correction was used.\n\nAuthor SummaryGenetic association studies focusing on rare variants using next generation sequencing (NGS) data have become a common strategy to overcome the shortcomings of classical genome-wide association studies for the analysis of rare and common diseases. The issue of population stratification remains however a substantial question that has not been fully resolved when analyzing NGS data. In this work, we propose a comprehensive evaluation of the main strategies to account for stratification, that are principal components and linear mixed model, along with a novel approach based on local permutations (LocPerm). We compared these correction methods in many different settings, considering several types of population structures, sample sizes or types of variants. Our results highlighted important limitations of some classical methods as those using principal components (in particular in small samples) and linear mixed models (in several situations). In contrast, LocPerm maintained a correct type I error in all situations. Also, we showed that adding a large panel of external controls, e.g coming from publicly available databases, is an efficient strategy to increase the power of an analysis including a low number of cases, as long as an appropriate stratification correction is used. Our findings provide helpful guidelines for many researchers working on rare variant association studies.",

Fresh blood samples were collected from both healthy and IgAV patients. Upon the distinct expressions of CD3, CD19, CD20, CD38, CD27 and IgD, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were initially categorized into plasmablasts and memory B cells. Subsequently, using surface markers including CD138 and IgM, and intracellular markers containing IgM and IgG, plasmablasts and memory B cells were further divided into distinct subgroups. A total of eleven populations were detected using multiple flow cytometry.\n\nResultsCD3-CD19+IgD+CD27-, CD3-CD19+CD20-CD38+, CD3-CD19+CD20-CD38+IgM+, and CD3-CD19+CD20-CD38+CD138+ B cells were larger in patients with IgAV than in the HCs. Only CD3-CD19+IgD-CD27+IgM+ B cell counts were reduced in IgAV. The elevated B cell numbers returned to normal after treatment.

On the contrary, CD3-CD19+IgD-CD27+IgM+ B cell numbers were negatively proportional to the plasma IgA levels while naive B cell numbers correlated with plasma and plasmablast B cell counts.\n\nConclusionsWe hypothesized that immunoglobulin production was abnormally elevated in IgAV and could be explained by altered B-cell subset homeostasis.",

E46K mutation in SNCA gene has not been investigated as intensive as other SNCA gene mutations including A30P and A53T. In this study, to induce PD in Drosophila flies, UAS-hSNCAWT and UAS-hSNCAE46K transgenic fly lines were constructed, where SNCA gene was over-expressed in flies brains using GAL4-UAS genetic system. Western blot analysis of head samples of SNCA-expressing flies verified SNCA expression at protein level. Light and electron microscopy analysis of ommatidial structures were performed to verify neurodegeneration as a result of -synuclein gene overexpression in Drosophila transgenic flies. Confocal microscopy analysis of dopaminergic neuron clusters verified cell loss following SNCAE46K expression in the flies brain. E46K -synuclein gene over-expression resulted in an evident decline in longevity as well as climbing ability of the flies. Biochemical studies of transgenic flies showed a remarkable decline in antioxidant enzymes activity and a significant increase in oxidative markers level as well as AchE enzyme activity. Oxidative stress has been known as a causal factor in PD pathogenesis, following expression of E46K mutant version of human SNCA gene.

In addition to its high mortality rate, only one treatment currently exists for ischemic stroke. Nonetheless, traditional Chinese medicine is often used as a reatment for the disease. Bezoar is a multi-functional drug that has been demonstrated to be effective for the treatment of ischemic stroke. However, its mechanism of action is yet to be fully elucidated. Based on network pharmacology, we explored the potential mechanism of action of bezoar. Symmap and literature data mining methods were used to obtain the target of bezoar. The mechanism of bezoar for the treatment of ischemic stroke was identified and ischemic stroke-related targets were retrieved using DrugBank, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, and Therapeutic Target Database. Protein-protein interaction networks were constructed using the Cytoscape plugin, BisoGenet, and analysed by topological methods. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment were carried out via the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery server. We obtained 48 potential targets and 3 signalling pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinase, hypoxia-inducible factor-1, and tumour necrosis factor signalling pathways. The mechanism of action of bezoar on ischemic stroke involves multiple targets and signalling pathways. Our research provides a network pharmacology framework for future Chinese medicinal research.",

    "abstract": "Casein Kinase 1 (CK1) family members are serine/threonine protein kinases ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotic organisms. They are involved in a wide range of important cellular processes, such as membrane trafficking, or vesicular transport in organisms from yeast to humans. Due to its broad spectrum of action, CK1 activity and expression is tightly regulated by a number of mechanisms, including subcellular sequestration. Defects in CK1 regulation, localisation or the introduction of mutations in the CK1 coding sequence are often associated with important diseases such as cancer. Increasing evidence suggest that the manipulation of host cell CK1 signalling pathways by intracellular pathogens, either by exploiting the host CK1 or by exporting the CK1 of the pathogen into the host cell may play an important role in infectious diseases. Leishmania CK1.2 is essential for parasite survival and released into the host cell, playing an important role in host pathogen interactions. Although Leishmania CK1.2 has dual role in the parasite and in the host cell, nothing is known about its parasitic localisation and organelle-specific functions. In this study, we show that CK1.2 is a ubiquitous kinase, which is present in the cytoplasm, associated to the cytoskeleton and localised to various organelles, indicating potential roles in kinetoplast and nuclear segregation, as well as ribosomal processing and motility. Furthermore, using truncated mutants, we show for the first time that the two low complexity regions (LCR) present in the C-terminus of CK1.2 are essential for the subcellular localisation of CK1.2 but not for its kinase activity, whereas the deletion of the N-terminus leads to a dramatic decrease in CK1.2 abundance. In conclusion, our data on the localisation and regulation of Leishmania CK1.2 contribute to increase the knowledge on this essential kinase and get insights into its role in the parasite.",

    "abstract": "The vertebrate branchial arches that give rise to structures of the head, neck, and heart form with very dynamic tissue growth and well-choreographed neural crest, ectoderm, and mesoderm cell dynamics. Although this morphogenesis has been studied by marker expression and fate-mapping, the mechanisms that control the collective migration and diversity of the neural crest and surrounding tissues remain unclear, in part due to the effects of averaging and need for cell isolation in conventional transcriptome analysis experiments of multiple cell populations. We used label free single cell RNA sequencing on 95,000 individual cells at 2 developmental stages encompassing formation of the first four chick branchial arches to measure the transcriptional states that define the cellular hierarchy and invasion signature of the migrating neural crest. The results confirmed basic features of cell type diversity and led to the discovery of many novel markers that discriminate between axial level and distal-to-proximal cell populations within the branchial arches and neural crest streams. We identified the transcriptional signature of the most invasive neural crest that is conserved within each branchial arch stream and elucidated a set of genes common to other cell invasion signatures in types in cancer, wound healing and development. These data robustly delineate molecularly distinct cell types within the branchial arches and identify important molecular transitions within the migrating neural crest during development.",

    "abstract": "Structural biology performed inside cells can capture molecular machines in action within their native context. Here we develop an integrative in-cell structural approach using the genome-reduced human pathogen Mycoplasma pneumoniae. We combine whole-cell crosslinking mass spectrometry, cellular cryo-electron tomography, and integrative modeling to determine an in-cell architecture of a transcribing and translating expressome at sub-nanometer resolution. The expressome comprises RNA polymerase (RNAP), the ribosome, and the transcription elongation factors NusG and NusA. We pinpoint NusA at the interface between a NusG-bound elongating RNAP and the ribosome, and propose it could mediate transcription-translation coupling. Translation inhibition dissociates the expressome, whereas transcription inhibition stalls and rearranges it, demonstrating that the active expressome architecture requires both translation and transcription elongation within the cell.",

    "abstract": "Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) is an allosteric enzyme responsible for maintaining phenylalanine (Phe) below neurotoxic levels; its failure results in phenylketonuria. Wild type (WT) PAH equilibrates among resting-state (RS-PAH) and activated (A-PAH) conformations, whose equilibrium position depends upon allosteric Phe binding to the A-PAH conformation. The RS-PAH conformation of WT rat PAH (rPAH) contains a cation-{pi} sandwich between Phe80, Arg123, and Arg420, which cannot exist in the A-PAH conformation. Phe80 variants F80A, F80D, F80L, and F80R were prepared; their conformational equilibrium was evaluated using native PAGE, size exclusion chromatography, ion exchange behavior, intrinsic protein fluorescence, enzyme kinetics, and limited proteolysis, each as a function of [Phe]. Like WT rPAH, F80A and F80D show allosteric activation by Phe while F80L and F80R are constitutively active. Maximal activity of all variants suggests relief of a rate-determining conformational change involving Phe80. Limited proteolysis of WT rPAH in the absence of Phe reveals facile cleavage within a C-terminal 4-helix bundle that is buried in the RS-PAH tetramer interface, reflecting dynamic dissociation of the RS-PAH conformation. This cleavage is not seen for the Phe80 variants, which all show proteolytic hypersensitivity in a linker that repositions during the RS-PAH to A-PAH conformational interchange. Hypersensitivity is corrected by addition of Phe such that all Phe80 variants become like WT rPAH and achieve the A-PAH conformation. Thus, manipulation of Phe80 perturbs the conformational space sampled by PAH, increasing the propensity to sample intermediates in the RS-PAH and A-PAH interchange, which are presumed on-pathway because they can readily achieve the A-PAH conformation by addition of Phe.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative damage on DNA arising from both endogenous and exogenous sources can result in base modifications that promote errors in replication as well as generate sites of base loss (abasic sites) that present unique challenges to maintaining genomic integrity. These lesions are excised by DNA glycosylases in the first step of the base excision repair pathway. Here we present the first crystal structure of a NEIL2 glycosylase, an enzyme active on cytosine oxidation products and abasic sites. The structure reveals an unusual \"open\" conformation not seen in NEIL1 or NEIL3 orthologs. NEIL2 is predicted to adopt a \"closed\" conformation when bound to its substrate. Combined crystallographic and solution scattering studies show the enzyme to be conformationally dynamic in a manner distinct among the NEIL glycosylases and provide insight into the unique substrate preference of the enzyme. Additionally, we characterized three cancer variants of human NEIL2, namely S140N, G230W, and G303R.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial failure caused by Parkin mutations contributes to Parkinsons disease. Parkin binds, ubiquitinates, and targets impaired mitochondria for autophagic destruction. Robust mitophagy involves peri-nuclear concentration of Parkin-tagged mitochondria, followed by dissemination of juxtanuclear mitochondrial aggregates, and efficient sequestration of individualized mitochondria by autophagosomes. Here, we report that the execution of complex mitophagic events requires active mitochondrial lipid remodeling. Parkin recruits phospholipase D2 to the depolarized mitochondria and generate phosphatidic acid (PA). Mitochondrial PA is subsequently converted to diacylglycerol (DAG) by Lipin-1 phosphatase-a process that further requires mitochondrial ubiquitination and ubiquitin-binding autophagic receptors, NDP52 and Optineurin. We show that Optineurin transports, via Golgi-derived vesicles, a PA-binding factor EndoB1 to ubiquitinated mitochondria, thereby facilitating DAG production. Mitochondrial DAG activates both F-actin assembly to drive mitochondrial individualization, and autophagosome biogenesis to efficiently restrict impaired mitochondria. Thus Parkin, autophagic receptors and the Golgi complex orchestrate mitochondrial lipid remodeling to execute robust mitophagy.",

    "abstract": "All proteins of the intermediate filament (IF) family contain the signature central -helical domain which forms a coiled-coil dimer. Because of its length, past structural studies relied on a  divide-and-conquer strategy whereby fragments of this domain were recombinantly produced, crystallized and analysed using X-rays. Here we describe a further development of this approach towards structural studies of nuclear IF protein lamin. To this end, we have fused lamin A fragments to short N- and C-terminal capping motifs which provide for the correct formation of parallel, in-register coiled-coil dimers. As the result, a chimeric construct containing lamin A residues 17-70 C-terminally capped by the Eb1 domain was solved to 1.83 [A] resolution. Another chimera containing lamin A residues 327-403 N-terminally capped by the Gp7 domain was solved to 2.9 [A]. In the latter case the capping motif was additionally modified to include a disulphide bridge at the dimer interface. We discuss multiple benefits of fusing coiled-coil dimers with such capping motifs, including a convenient crystallographic phasing by either molecular replacement or sulphur single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (S-SAD) measurements.",
