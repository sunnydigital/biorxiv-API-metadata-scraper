    "abstract": "BackgroundManipulative parasites are thought to liberate molecules in their external environment acting as manipulation factors with biological functions implicated in their hosts physiological and behavioural alterations. These manipulation factors are part of a complex mixture called the secretome. While the secretomes of various parasites have been described, there is very little data for a putative manipulative parasite. It is necessary to study the molecular interaction between a manipulative parasite and its host to better understand how such alterations evolve.\n\nMethodsHere, we used proteomics to characterize the secretome of a model cestode with a complex life cycle based on trophic transmission. We studied Schistocephalus solidus during the life stage in which behavioural changes take place in its obligatory intermediate fish host, the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We produced a novel genome sequence and assembly of S. solidus to improve protein coding gene prediction and annotation for this parasite. We then described the whole worms proteome and its secretome during fish host infection using LC-MS/MS.\n\nResultsA total of 2 290 proteins were detected in the proteome of S. solidus, and 30 additional proteins were detected specifically in the secretome. We found that the secretome contains proteases, proteins with neural and immune functions, as well as proteins involved in cell communication. We detected Receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatases, which were reported in other parasitic systems to be manipulation factors. We also detected 12 S. solidus-specific proteins in the secretome that may play important roles in host-parasite interactions.\n\nConclusionsOur results suggest that S. solidus liberates molecules with putative host manipulation functions in the host and that many of them are species specific.",

    "abstract": "The majority of data on human Natural Killer (NK) cell phenotype and function has been generated using cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). However, cryopreservation can have adverse effects on PBMCs. In contrast, investigating immune cells in whole blood can reduce the time, volume of blood required, and potential artifacts associated with manipulation of the cells. Whole blood collected from healthy donors and cancer patients was processed by three separate protocols that can be used independently or in parallel to assess extracellular receptors, intracellular signaling protein phosphorylation, and intracellular and extracellular cytokine production in human NK cells. To assess extracellular receptor expression, 200 L of whole blood was incubated with an extracellular staining (ECS) mix and cells were subsequently fixed and RBCs lysed prior to analysis. The phosphorylation status of signaling proteins was assessed in 500 L of whole blood following co-incubation with interleukin (IL)-2/12 and the ECS mix for 20 minutes prior to cell fixation and RBC lysis and subsequent permeabilization for staining with an intracellular staining (ICS) mix. Cytokine production (IFN{gamma}) was similarly assessed by incubating 1 mL of whole blood with PMA-ionomycin or IL-2/12 prior to incubation with ECS and subsequent ICS antibodies. In addition, plasma was collected from stimulated samples prior to ECS for quantification of secreted IFN{gamma} by ELISA. Results were consistent, despite inherent interpatient variability. Although we did not investigate an exhaustive list of targets, this approach enabled quantification of representative ECS surface markers including activating (NKG2D and DNAM-1) and inhibitory (NKG2D, PD-1, TIGIT, and TIM-3) receptors, cytokine receptors (CD25, CD122, CD132, and CD212) and ICS markers associated with NK cell activation following stimulation, including signaling protein phosphorylation (p-STAT4, p-STAT5, p-p38 MAPK, p-S6K) and IFN{gamma} in both healthy donors and cancer patients. In addition, we compared extracellular receptor expression using whole blood versus cryopreserved PBMCs and observed a significant difference in the expression of almost all receptors. The methods presented permit a relatively rapid parallel assessment of immune cell receptor expression, signaling protein activity, and cytokine production in a minimal volume of whole blood from both healthy donors and cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "How neuronal variability impacts neuronal codes is a central question in systems neuroscience, often with complex and model dependent answers. Most population models are parametric, with a tacitly assumed structure of neuronal tuning and population-wide variability. While these models provide key insights, they purposely divorce any mechanistic relationship between trial average and trial variable neuronal activity. By contrast, circuit based models produce activity with response statistics that are reflection of the underlying circuit structure, and thus any relations between trial averaged and trial variable activity are emergent rather than assumed. In this work, we study information transfer in networks of spatially ordered spiking neuron models with strong excitatory and inhibitory interactions, capable of producing rich population-wide neuronal variability. Motivated by work in the visual system we embed a columnar stimulus orientation map in the network and measure the population estimation of an orientated input. We show that the spatial structure of feedforward and recurrent connectivity are critical determinants for population code performance. In particular, when network wiring supports stable firing rate activity then with a sufficiently large number of decoded neurons all available stimulus information is transmitted. However, if the inhibitory projections place network activity in a pattern forming regime then the population-wide dynamics compromise information flow. In total, network connectivity determines both the stimulus tuning as well as internally generated population-wide fluctuations and thereby dictates population code performance in complicated ways where modeling efforts provide essential understanding.",

    "abstract": "The oncogenic properties of mutant p53 have been ascribed to destabilization of the p53 conformation, followed by aggregation into insoluble fibrils. Here we combine immunofluorescent 3D confocal microscopy of breast cancer cells expressing the p53 mutant Arg248Gln (R248Q) with light scattering from solutions of the purified protein and molecular simulations to probe the mechanisms that govern phase behaviors of the mutant across multiple length scales, from cellular to molecular. We establish that p53 R248Q forms mesoscopic protein-rich clusters, an anomalous liquid phase with several unique properties. We demonstrate that the clusters host and facilitate the nucleation of amyloid fibrils. The distinct characteristics of the clusters of R248Q and wild-type p53 and theoretical models indicate that p53 condensation into clusters is driven by the structural destabilization of the core domain and not by interactions of its extensive disordered region. Two-step nucleation of mutant p53 amyloids suggests means to control fibrillization and the associated pathologies through modifying the cluster behaviors. In a broader context, our findings exemplify interactions between distinct protein phases that activate complex physicochemical mechanisms operating in biological systems.",

    "abstract": "In analogy to the development of fluorescent proteins, innovative tools for screening optoacoustic cell labels could lead to tailored protein labels for OA, imparting novel ways to visualize biological structure and function. Optoacoustic imaging emerges towards a highly promising modality for life sciences and medical practise with advantageous capabilities such as great accessible depth, and 3D studying of living tissue. The development of novel labels with molecular specificity could significantly enhance the optoacoustic contrast, specificity, and sensitivity and allow optoacoustic to interrogate tissues not amenable to the fluorescence method. We report on an optoacoustic flow cytometer (OAFC) prototype, developed for screening optoacoustic reporter genes. The cytometer concurrently records light scattering for referencing purposes. Since recording light scattering is completely independent from OA, we believe it to be a more reliable referencing method than e.g. fluorescence or ultrasound-backscatter. Precise characterization of our OAFC prototype showcases its ability to optoacoustically characterize objects in-flow that are in the size range of single cells. We apply the OAFC to distinguish individual E. coli cells based on optoacoustic properties of their expressed chromoproteins read in-flow using microfluidic arrangements and achieved precisions over 90%. We discuss how the light scattering referenced OAFC method offers a critical step towards routine measurement of optoacoustic properties of single-cells and could pave the way for identifying genetically encoded optoacoustic reporters, by transferring working concepts of the fluorescence field.",

Here we demonstrate, by crystal structures, the self-assembly of the antibacterial human LL-37 active core (residues 17-29) into a stable structure of densely packed helices. The surface of the fibril encompasses alternating hydrophobic and positively charged zigzagged belts, which likely underlie interactions with and subsequent disruption of negatively charged lipid bilayers, such as bacterial membranes. LL-3717-29 correspondingly formed wide, ribbon-like, thermostable fibrils in solution, which co-localized with bacterial cells, and structure-guided mutagenesis analyses supported the role of self-assembly in antibacterial activity. LL-3717-29 resembled, in sequence and in the ability to form amphipathic helical fibrils, the bacterial cytotoxic PSM3 peptide that assembles into cross- amyloid fibrils. This suggests helical, self-assembling, basic building blocks across kingdoms of life and point to potential structural mimicry mechanisms.

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is uniformly fatal with a one year median survival rate, despite the best available treatment, including radiotherapy (RT). Impacts of prior RT on tumor recurrence are poorly understood but may increase tumor aggressiveness. Metabolic changes have been investigated in radiation-induced brain injury; however, the tumor-promoting effect following prior radiation is lacking. Since RT is vital to GBM management, we quantified the tumor-promoting effects of prior radiotherapy (RT) on patient-derived intracranial GBM xenografts and characterized the metabolic alterations associated with the protumorigenic microenvironment. Human xenografts (GBM143) were implanted into nude mice 24h following 20Gy cranial radiation vs. sham animals. Tumors in pre-radiated mice were more proliferative and more infiltrative, yielding faster mortality (p<0.0001). Histologic evaluation of tumor associated macrophage/microglia (TAMs) revealed cells with a more fully activated ameboid morphology in pre-radiated animals. Microdialyzates from the radiated brain at the margin of tumor infiltration contralateral to the site of implantation were analyzed by unsupervised liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). In pre-radiated animals, metabolites known to be associated with tumor progression (like, modified nucleotides and polyols) were identified. Whole-tissue metabolomic analysis of the pre-radiated brain microenvironment for metabolic alterations in a separate cohort of nude mice using 1H-NMR revealed significant decrease in levels of antioxidants (glutathione (GSH) and ascorbate (ASC)), NAD+, TCA intermediates, and increased ATP and GTP. Glutathione and ASC showed highest VIPpred (1.65) in OPLS-DA analysis. Involvement of ASC catabolism was further confirmed by GC-MS. To assess longevity of radiation effects, we compared survival with implantation occuring 2 months vs. 24h following radiation, finding worse survival in animals implanted at 2 months. These radiation-induced alterations are consistent with a chronic disease-like microenvironment characterized by reduced levels of antioxidants and NAD+, as well as elevated extracellular ATP and GTP serving as chemoattractants, promoting cell motility and vesicular secretion with decreased levels of GSH and ASC exacerbating oxidative stress. Taken together, these data suggest that IR induces tumor-permissive changes in the microenvironment with metabolomic alterations that may facilitate tumor aggressiveness with important implications for recurrent glioblastoma. Harnessing these metabolomic insights may provide opportunities to attenuate RT-associated aggressiveness of recurrent GBM.",

In pursuit of potential links of m5C with mRNA translation, we performed polysome profiling of human HeLa cell lysates and subjected RNA from resultant fractions to efficient bisulfite conversion followed by RNA sequencing (bsRNA-seq). Bioinformatic filters for rigorous site calling were devised to reduce technical noise. We obtained [~]1,000 candidate m5C sites in the wider transcriptome, most of which were found in mRNA. Multiple novel sites were validated by amplicon-specific bsRNA-seq in independent samples of either human HeLa, LNCaP and PrEC cells. Furthermore, RNAi-mediated depletion of either the NSUN2 or TRDMT1 m5C:RNA methyltransferases showed a clear dependence on NSUN2 for the majority of tested sites in both mRNAs and noncoding RNAs. Candidate m5C sites in mRNAs are enriched in 5UTRs and near start codons, and are commonly embedded in a local context reminiscent of the NSUN2-dependent m5C sites found in the variable loop of tRNA. Analysing mRNA sites across the polysome profile revealed that modification levels, at bulk and for many individual sites, were inversely correlated with ribosome association. Altogether, these findings emphasise the major role of NSUN2 in making this mark transcriptome-wide and further substantiate a functional interdependence of cytosine methylation level with mRNA translation.",

    "abstract": "Electrophysiology data acquisition of single neurons represents a key factor for the understanding of neuronal dynamics. However, the traditional method to acquire this data is through patch-clamp technology, which presents serious scalability flaws due to its slowness and complexity to record at fine-grained spatial precision (dendrites and axon).\n\nIn silico biophysical models are therefore created for simulating hundreds of experiments that would be impractical to recreate in vitro. The optimal way to create these models is based on the knowledge of the morphological and electrical features for each neuron. Since large-scale data acquisition is often unfeasible for electrical data, previous expert knowledge can be used but it must have an acceptable degree of similarity with the type of neurons that we are trying to model.\n\nHere, we present a data-driven machine learning approach to predict the electrophysiological features of single neurons in case of only having their morphology available. To solve this multi-output regression problem, we use an artificial neural network that has the particularity of providing a probability distribution for every output feature, to incorporate uncertainty. Input data to train the model is obtained from from the Allen Cell Types database. The electrical properties can depend on the morphology, whose acquisition technology is highly automated and scalable so there exist large data sets of them. We also provide integrations with the BluePyOpt library to create a biophysical model using the original morphology and the predicted electrical features. Finally, we connect the resulting biophysical model with the Geppetto UI software to run all the simulations in a sophisticated user interface.",

    "abstract": "The direct reprogramming of adult skin fibroblasts to neurons is thought to be controlled by a small set of interacting gene regulators. Here, we investigate how the interaction dynamics between these regulating factors coordinate cellular decision making in direct neuronal reprogramming. We put forward a quantitative model of the governing gene regulatory system, supported by measurements of mRNA expression level dynamics. We find that reinterpreting the interaction between two genes (PTB and nPTB) is necessary to capture quantitative gene interaction dynamics and correctly predict the outcome of various overexpression and knockdown experiments. This analysis is strengthened by a novel analytical technique to dissect system behaviour and reveal the influence of individual factors on resulting gene expression. Overall, we demonstrate that computational analysis is a powerful tool for understanding the mechanisms of direct (neuronal) reprogramming, paving the way for future models that can help improve cell conversion strategies.",

    "abstract": "A newly identified coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, has been posing significant threats to public health since December 2019. ACE2, the host cell receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS), has recently been demonstrated in mediating 2019-nCoV infection. Interestingly, besides the respiratory system, substantial proportion of SARS and 2019-nCoV patients showed signs of various degrees of liver damage, the mechanism and implication of which have not yet been determined. Here, we performed an unbiased evaluation of cell type specific expression of ACE2 in healthy liver tissues using single cell RNA-seq data of two independent cohorts, and identified specific expression in cholangiocytes. The results indicated that virus might directly bind to ACE2 positive cholangiocytes but not necessarily hepatocytes. This finding suggested the liver abnormalities of SARS and 2019-nCoV patients may not be due to hepatocyte damage, but cholangiocyte dysfunction and other causes such as drug induced and systemic inflammatory response induced liver injury. Our findings indicate that special care of liver dysfunction should be installed in treating 2019-nCoV patients during the hospitalization and shortly after cure.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial cell (EC) responses to fluid shear stress (FSS) are crucial for vascular development, adult physiology and disease. PECAM1 is an important transducer but earlier events remain poorly understood. We therefore investigated heterotrimeric G proteins in FSS sensing. Knockdown (KD) in ECs of single G proteins had little effect but combined depletion of Gi and Gq/11 blocked all known PECAM1-dependent responses. Re-expression of Gi2 and Gq but not Gi1 and Gi3 rescued these effects. Sequence alignment and mutational studies identified that K307 in Gi2 and Gq/11 (Q306 in Gi1/3), determines participation in flow signaling. We developed pull-down assays for measuring G activation and found that this residue, localized to the GPCR interface, determines activation by FSS. We developed a protocol for affinity purification of GPCRs on activated Gs, which identified latrophilins (ADGRLs) as specific upstream interactors for Gi2 and Gq/11. Depletion of latrophilin-2 blocked EC activation of Gi2 and Gq, downstream events in vitro, and flow-dependent vascular morphogenesis in zebrafish embryos. Surprisingly, latrophilin-2 depletion also blocked flow activation of two additional pathways activated at cell-cell junctions, Smad1/5 and Notch1, independently of G proteins. Latrophilins are thus central mediators of junctional shear stress mechanotransduction via G protein-dependent and -independent mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundShort tandem repeats are important source of genetic variation, they are highly mutable and repeat expansions are associated dozens of human disorders, such as Huntingtons disease and spinocerebellar ataxias. Technical advantages in sequencing technology have made it possible to analyse these repeats at large scale, however, accurate genotyping is still a challenging task. We compared four different short tandem repeats genotyping tools on whole exome sequencing data to determine their genotyping performance and limits which will aid other researchers to choose a suitable tool and parameters for analysis.\n\nMethodsThe analysis was performed on the Simons Simplex Collection dataset where we used a novel method of evaluation with accuracy determined by the rate of homozygous calls on the X chromosome of male samples. In total we analysed 433 samples and around a million genotypes for evaluating tools on whole exome sequencing data.\n\nResultsWe determined a relatively good performance of all tools when genotyping repeats of 3-6 bp in length which could be improved with coverage and quality score filtering. However, genotyping homopolymers was challenging for all tools and a high error rate was present across different thresholds of coverage and quality scores. Interestingly, dinucleotide repeats displayed a high error rate as well, which was found to be mainly caused by the AC/TG repeats. Overall, LobSTR was able to make the most calls and was also the fastest tool while RepeatSeq and HipSTR exhibited the lowest heterozygous error rate at low coverage.\n\nConclusionsAll tools have different strengths and weaknesses and the choice may depend on the type of analysis. In this analysis we demonstrated the effect of using different filtering parameters and offered recommendations based on the trade-off between the best accuracy of genotyping and the highest number of calls.",

    "abstract": "Human and animal studies have shown that exposure to the organochlorine pesticide dieldrin is associated with increased risk of Parkinsons disease (PD). Previous work showed that developmental dieldrin exposure increased neuronal susceptibility to MPTP toxicity in male C57BL/6 mice, possibly via changes in dopamine (DA) packaging and turnover. However, the relevance of the MPTP model to PD pathophysiology has been questioned. We therefore studied dieldrin-induced neurotoxicity in the -synuclein (-syn)-preformed fibril (PFF) model, which better reflects the -syn pathology and toxicity observed in PD pathogenesis. Specifically, we used a \"two-hit\" model to determine whether developmental dieldrin exposure increases susceptibility to -syn PFF-induced synucleinopathy. Dams were fed either dieldrin (0.3 mg/kg, every 3-4 days) or vehicle corn oil starting 1 month prior to breeding and continuing through weaning of pups at postnatal day 22. At 12 weeks of age, male and female offspring received intrastriatal PFF or control saline injections. Consistent with the male-specific increased susceptibility to MPTP, our results demonstrate that developmental dieldrin exposure exacerbates PFF-induced toxicity in male mice only. Specifically, in male offspring, dieldrin exacerbated PFF-induced motor deficits on the challenging beam and increased DA turnover in the striatum 6 months after PFF injection. However, male offspring showed neither exacerbation of phosphorylated -syn (pSyn) aggregation in the substantia nigra (SN) at 1 or 2 months post-PFF injection, nor exacerbation of PFF-induced TH and NeuN loss in the SN 6 months post-PFF injection. Collectively, these data indicate that developmental dieldrin exposure produces a male-specific increase in neuronal vulnerability to synucleinopathy. This sex-specific result is consistent with both previous work in the MPTP model, our previously reported sex-specific effects of this exposure paradigm on the male and female epigenome, and the higher prevalence and more severe course of PD in males. The novel two-hit environmental toxicant/PFF exposure paradigm established in this project can be used to explore the mechanisms by which other PD-related exposures alter neuronal vulnerability to synucleinopathy in sporadic PD.\n\nHighlightsO_LIDevelopmental dieldrin exposure increases -syn-PFF-induced motor deficits\nC_LIO_LIDevelopmental dieldrin exposure increases PFF-induced deficits in DA handling\nC_LIO_LIDevelopmental dieldrin exposure does not affect PFF-induced loss of nigral neurons\nC_LIO_LIThis is a novel paradigm modeling how environmental factors increase risk of PD\nC_LIO_LIFemale mice show PFF-induced pathology, but no PFF-induced motor deficits.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Sea turtle populations are directly and indirectly under threat from a range of anthropogenic processes. Perhaps the most visibly apparent of these is the disfiguring tumor disease epizootic (animal epidemic) known as fibropapillomatosis. Fibropapillomatosis continues to spread geographically, with prevalence of the disease also growing at a number of affected sites globally. Environmental exposures seem key to inducing tumor development, possibly through weakening host immune systems to the point of enabling pathogen-induced tumor formation. However, we do not yet understand the precise molecular and mutational events driving fibropapillomatosis tumor formation and progression. Similarly, many open questions remain about the role of the herpesvirus (chelonid herpesvirus 5, ChHV5) associated with the disease as a potential co-trigger, and whether its occurrence within tumors is causative or opportunistic. Without improved understanding of the basic biology of this disease epizootic, treatment, containment and mitigation options are severely hampered.\n\nTo address fundamental questions relating to the oncogenic signaling, mutational spectrum, viral load, viral transcriptional status (lytic or latent) and spread, we employed transcriptomic profiling, whole genome sequencing, immunohistochemistry and environmental (e)DNA-based monitoring of viral shedding. In particular we focused on the mutational landscape of tumors and assessing the transcriptional similarity of external (skin) and internal (visceral organs) tumors, and the oncogenic signaling events driving early stage tumor growth and post-surgical tumor regrowth. These analyses revealed that internal fibropapillomatosis tumors are molecularly distinct from the more common external tumors. However, our molecular analyses also revealed that there are a small number of conserved potentially therapeutically targetable molecular vulnerabilities in common between internal and external tumors, such as the MAPK, Wnt, TGF{beta} and TNF oncogenic signaling pathways. We also determined that the tumor genomes can harbor copy number gains, indicating potentially viral-independent oncogenic processes. Genes within such mutated genomic regions have known roles in human skin cancer, including MAPK-associated genes. Turtles attempt to mount an immune response, but in some animals this appears to be insufficient to prevent tumor development and growth. ChHV5 was transcriptionally latent in all tumor stages sequenced, including early stage and recurrent tumors. We also revealed that the tumors themselves are the primary source of viral shedding into the marine environment and, if they are surgically removed, the level of ChHV5 in the water column drops.\n\nTogether, these results offer an improved understanding of fibropapillomatosis tumorigenesis and provide insights into the origins, therapeutic treatment, and appropriate quarantine responses for this wildlife epizootic. Furthermore, they provide insights into human pathogen-induced cancers, particularly mechanisms which are difficult to study in the human and terrestrial context, such as time-course quantification-based monitoring of viral shedding.",

    "abstract": "Using an information criterion to evaluate models fitted to spike train data from chinchilla semicircular canal afferent neurons, we found that the superficially complex functional organization of the canal nerve branch can be accurately quantified in an elegant mathematical model with only three free parameters. Spontaneous spike trains are samples from stationary renewal processes whose interval distributions are Exwald distributions, convolutions of Inverse Gaussian and Exponential distributions. We show that a neuronal membrane compartment is a natural computer for calculating parameter likelihoods given samples from a point process with such a distribution, which may facilitate fast, accurate, efficient Bayesian neural computation for estimating the kinematic state of the head. The model suggests that Bayesian neural computation is an aspect of a more general principle that has driven the evolution of nervous system design, the energy efficiency of biological information processing.\n\nSignificance StatementNervous systems ought to have evolved to be Bayesian, because Bayesian inference allows statistically optimal evidence-based decisions and actions. A variety of circumstantial evidence suggests that animal nervous systems are indeed capable of Bayesian inference, but it is unclear how they could do this. We have identified a simple, accurate generative model of vestibular semicircular canal afferent neuron spike trains. If the brain is a Bayesian observer and a Bayes-optimal decision maker, then the initial stage of processing vestibular information must be to compute the posterior density of head kinematic state given sense data of this form. The model suggests how neurons could do this. Head kinematic state estimation given point-process inertial data is a well-defined dynamical inference problem whose solution formed a foundation for vertebrate brain evolution. The new model provides a foundation for developing realistic, testable spiking neuron models of dynamical state estimation in the vestibulo-cerebellum, and other parts of the Bayesian brain.",

    "abstract": "The present study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of galantamine administered orally as a pre-treatment to mitigate the acute toxicity of 4.0xLD50 soman in Cynomolgus monkeys post-treated with atropine, 2-PAM, and midazolam. Pharmacokinetic experiments revealed that the oral doses of 1.5 and 3.0 mg/kg galantamine HBr were quickly absorbed and produced plasma concentrations of galantamine that generated approximately 20% to 40% reversible inhibition of blood acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. This degree of reversible AChE inhibition has been shown to be safe and sufficient to protect AChE from the irreversible inhibition by nerve agents, and, thereby, suppress the acute toxicity of these agents. Thus, in subsequent experiments, adult male Cynomolgus monkeys were pretreated orally with 1.5 or 3.0 mg/kg galantamine, challenged intramuscularly with 4.0xLD50, and post-treated with intramuscular injections of 0.4 mg/kg atropine, 30 mg/kg 2-PAM, and 0.32 mg/kg midazolam. All animals subjected to these treatments survived the soman. By contrast, none of the animals that were pretreated with saline and only 40% of the animals that were pretreated with pyridostigmine survived the soman challenge when post-treated with the same conventional antidotal therapy as that delivered to the galantamine-pretreated, soman-challenged monkeys. In addition, large numbers of degenerating neurons were visualized in the hippocampi of soman-challenged monkeys that had been pretreated with pyridostigmine or saline, but not in the hippocampi of animals that had been pretreated with galantamine. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the effectiveness of clinically relevant oral doses of galantamine to prevent the acute toxicity of supra-lethal doses of soman in non-human primates.",

    "abstract": "The adaptive immune system of vertebrates can detect, respond to, and memorize diverse pathogens from past experience. While the selection of T helper (Th) clones is the simple and established mechanism to recognize and memorize new pathogens, the question that still remains unexplored is how the Th cells can acquire better ways to bias the responses of immune cells for eliminating pathogens more efficiently by translating the recognized antigen information into regulatory signals. In this work, we address this problem by associating the adaptive immune network organized by the Th cells with reinforcement learning (RL). By employing recent advancements of network-based RL, we show that the Th immune network can acquire the association between antigen patterns of and the effective responses to pathogens. Moreover, the clonal selection as well as other inter-cellular interactions are derived as a learning rule of this network. We also demonstrate that the stationary clone-size distribution after learning shares characteristic features with those observed experimentally. Our theoretical framework may contribute to revising and renewing our understanding of adaptive immunity as a learning system.",

The N50 contig length for the two assemblies were 17.1 Mb (58 contigs) and 0.29 Mb (963 contigs), respectively, reflecting recent improvements in the technology. Comparison with a de novo short read assembly for Ni100 corroborated genome integrity and quantified sequence related error rates (0.002%). The contiguity and coverage allowed unprecedented access to low complexity regions of the genome. Pericentromeric regions and coincidence of hypo-methylation enabled localization of active centromeres and identified a novel centromere-associated ALE class I element which appears to have proliferated through relatively recent nested transposition events (<1 million years ago). Computational abstraction was used to define a post-triplication Brassica specific ancestral genome and to calculate the extensive rearrangements that define the genomic distance separating B. nigra from its diploid relatives.",

In this study, we carried out an in-depth characterization of HD cells in S1HL. We show fast-spiking (FS), putative inhibitory neurons are over-represented in and sharply tuned to HD compared to regular-spiking (RS), putative excitatory neurons. These FS HD cells are non-conjunctive, rarely theta modulated, not locally connected and are enriched in layer 4/5a. Their co-existence with RS HD cells and angular head velocity (AHV) cells in a layer-specific fashion through the S1HL presents a previously unreported organization of spatial circuits.

    "abstract": "Hypoxia is a component of multiple disorders, including stroke and sleep-disordered breathing, that often precede or are comorbid with neurodegenerative diseases. However, little is known about how hypoxia affects the ability of microglia, resident CNS macrophages, to respond to subsequent inflammatory challenges that are often present during neurodegenerative processes. We therefore tested the hypothesis that hypoxia would enhance or \"prime\" microglial pro-inflammatory gene expression in response to a later inflammatory challenge without programmatically increasing basal levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. To test this, we pre-exposed immortalized N9 and primary microglia to hypoxia (1% O2) for 16 hrs and then challenged them with pro-inflammatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS) either immediately or 3-6 days following hypoxic exposure. We used RNA sequencing coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing to analyze primed microglial inflammatory gene expression and modifications to histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) at the promoters of primed genes. We found that microglia exhibited enhanced responses to LPS 3 days and 6 days post-hypoxia. Surprisingly however, the majority of primed genes were not enriched for H3K4me3 acutely following hypoxia exposure. Using the bioinformatics tool MAGICTRICKS and reversible pharmacological inhibition, we found that primed genes required the transcriptional activities of NF-B. These findings provide evidence that hypoxia pre-exposure could lead to persistent and aberrant inflammatory responses in the context of CNS disorders.",

Using a combined transcriptomics and metabolomics approach, we studied the response of seedlings to N starvation of two different tetraploid wheat genotypes from the two main domesticated subspecies, emmer (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccum) and durum wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum). We found that durum wheat exhibits broader and stronger response in comparison to emmer as evidenced by the analysis of the differential expression pattern of both genes and metabolites and gene enrichment analysis. Emmer and durum wheat showed major differences in the responses to N starvation for transcription factor families. While emmer showed differential reduction in the levels of primary metabolites to N starvation, durum wheat exhibited increased levels of most metabolites, including GABA as an indicator of metabolic imbalance. The correlation-based networks including the differentially expressed genes and metabolites revealed tighter regulation of metabolism in durum wheat in comparison to emmer, as evidenced by the larger number of significant correlations. We also found that glutamate and GABA had highest values of centrality in the metabolic correlation network, suggesting their critical role in the genotype-specific response to N starvation of emmer and durum wheat, respectively. Moreover, this finding indicates that there might be contrasting strategies associated to GABA and Glutamate signaling modulating shoot vs root growth in the two different wheat subspecies.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic engineering in the post-genomic era is characterised by the development of new methods for metabolomics and fluxomics, supported by the integration of genetic engineering tools and mathematical modelling. Particularly, constraint-based stoichiometric models have been widely studied: (i) flux balance analysis (FBA) (in silico), and (ii) metabolic flux analysis (MFA) (in vivo). Recent studies have enabled the incorporation of thermodynamics and metabolomics data to improve the predictive capabilities of these approaches. However, an in-depth comparison and evaluation of these methods is lacking. This study presents a thorough analysis of two different in silico methods tested against experimental data (metabolomics and 13C-MFA) for the mesophile Escherichia coli. In particular, a modified version of the recently published matTFA toolbox was created, providing a broader range of physicochemical parameters. Validating against experimental data allowed the determination of the best physicochemical parameters to perform the TFA (Thermodynamics-based Flux Analysis). An analysis of flux pattern changes in the central carbon metabolism between 13C-MFA and TFA highlighted the limited capabilities of both approaches for elucidating the anaplerotic fluxes. In addition, a method based on centrality measures was suggested to identify important metabolites that (if quantified) would allow to further constrain the TFA. Finally, this study emphasised the need for standardisation in the fluxomics community: novel approaches are frequently released but a thorough comparison with currently accepted methods is not always performed.\n\nAuthor summaryBiotechnology has benefitted from the development of high throughput methods characterising living systems at different levels (e.g. concerning genes or proteins), allowing the industrial production of chemical commodities. Recently, focus has been placed on determining reaction rates (or metabolic fluxes) in the metabolic network of certain microorganisms, in order to identify bottlenecks hindering their exploitation. Two main approaches are commonly used, termed metabolic flux analysis (MFA) and flux balance analysis (FBA), based on measuring and estimating fluxes, respectively. While the influence of thermodynamics in living systems was accepted several decades ago, its application to study biochemical networks has only recently been enabled. In this sense, a multitude of different approaches constraining well-established modelling methods with thermodynamics has been suggested. However, physicochemical parameters are generally not properly adjusted to the experimental conditions, which might affect their predictive capabilities. In this study, we have explored the reliability of currently available tools by investigating the impact of varying said parameters in the simulation of metabolic fluxes and metabolite concentration values. Additionally, our in-depth analysis allowed us to highlight limitations and potential solutions that should be considered in future studies.",

Despite the necessity to development conservation strategies for Pontoporia blainvillei studies aiming to feature the reproductive biology and morphological characteristics of the genital organs are still scarce. In this context, the aim of this study was describe the morphological aspects of the genital organs of Pontoporia blainvillei. For this purpose, six male specimens of P. blainvillei stranded on the southeast region of Brazil, were used. Initially animals were measured, and the genital organs were collected, dissected and photodocumented. Then, fragments of all collected organs were submitted to microscopic analysis. The male genital organs of P. blainvillei showed similar results described for other cetaceans, such as, topography in abdominal cavity, presence of two testicles with epididymis, fibroelastic penis with sigmoid shape and presence of deferent duct. Moreover, a male uterus non-functional, two vestigial bones that support the penis, one retractor penis muscle and presence of associated muscles that support the entire reproductive apparatus were observed. However, some differences were present, such as, a simple cubic epithelium in the light of the epididymis, a small testicle even in sexually mature animals and absence of prostate, not previously observed in other cetaceans. Therefore, the animals analyzed showed similar features to other cetaceans, however some peculiarities were observed.",

    "abstract": "As of February 20, 2020, the 2019 novel coronavirus (renamed to COVID-19) spread to 30 countries with 2130 deaths and more than 75500 confirmed cases. COVID-19 is being compared to the infamous SARS coronavirus, which resulted, between November 2002 and July 2003, in 8098 confirmed cases worldwide with a 9.6% death rate and 774 deaths. Though COVID-19 has a death rate of 2.8% as of 20 February, the 75752 confirmed cases in a few weeks (December 8, 2019 to February 20, 2020) are alarming, with cases likely being under-reported given the comparatively longer incubation period. Such outbreaks demand elucidation of taxonomic classification and origin of the virus genomic sequence, for strategic planning, containment, and treatment. This paper identifies an intrinsic COVID-19 genomic signature and uses it together with a machine learning-based alignment-free approach for an ultra-fast, scalable, and highly accurate classification of whole COVID-19 genomes. The proposed method combines supervised machine learning with digital signal processing for genome analyses, augmented by a decision tree approach to the machine learning component, and a Spearmans rank correlation coefficient analysis for result validation. These tools are used to analyze a large dataset of over 5000 unique viral genomic sequences, totalling 61.8 million bp. Our results support a hypothesis of a bat origin and classify COVID-19 as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus. Our method achieves high levels of classification accuracy and discovers the most relevant relationships among over 5,000 viral genomes within a few minutes, ab initio, using raw DNA sequence data alone, and without any specialized biological knowledge, training, gene or genome annotations. This suggests that, for novel viral and pathogen genome sequences, this alignment-free whole-genome machine-learning approach can provide a reliable real-time option for taxonomic classification.",

    "abstract": "Understanding cellular remodeling in response to mechanical stimuli is a critical step in elucidating mechano-activation of biochemical signaling pathways. Experimental evidence indicates that external stress-induced subcellular adaptation is accomplished through dynamic cytoskeletal reorganization. To study the interactions between subcellular structures involved in transducing mechanical signals, we combined experimental and computational simulations to evaluate real-time mechanical adaptation of the actin cytoskeletal network. Actin cytoskeleton was imaged at the same time as an external tensile force was applied to live vascular smooth muscle cells using a fibronectin-functionalized atomic force microscope probe. In addition, we performed computational simulations of active cytoskeletal networks under a tensile external force. The experimental data and simulation results suggest that mechanical structural adaptation occurs before chemical adaptation during filament bundle formation: actin filaments first align in the direction of the external force, initializing anisotropic filament orientations, then the chemical evolution of the network follows the anisotropic structures to further develop the bundle-like geometry. This finding presents an alternative, novel explanation for the stress fiber formation and provides new insight into the mechanism of mechanotransduction.\n\nAuthor SummaryRemodeling the cytoskeletal network in response to external force is key to mechanosensing and locomotion. Despite much focus on cytoskeletal remodeling in recent years, a comprehensive understanding of actin remodeling in real-time in cells under mechanical stimuli is still lacking. We integrated stress-induced 3D actin imaging and 3D computational simulations of actin cytoskeleton to study how the actin cytoskeleton form bundles and how these bundles evolve over time upon external tensile stress. We found a rapid actin alignment and a slower bundle evolution leading to denser bundles. Based on these results, we propose a \"mechanics before chemistry\" model of actin cytoskeleton remodeling under external force.",

    "abstract": "FRET (fluorescence energy transfer) between far-upstream (-100) and downstream (+14) cyanine dyes showed extensive bending/wrapping of {lambda}PR promoter DNA on E. coli RNA polymerase (RNAP) in closed and open complexes (CC, OC). Here we determine the kinetics and mechanism of DNA bending/wrapping by FRET and of formation of RNAP contacts with -100 and +14 DNA by single-dye fluorescence enhancements (PIFE). FRET/PIFE kinetics exhibit two phases: rapidly-reversible steps forming a CC ensemble ({CC}c of four intermediates (initial (RPC), early (I1E), mid-(I1M), late (I1L)), followed by conversion of {CC} to OC via I1L. FRET and PIFE are first observed for I1E, not RPc. FRET/PIFE together reveal large-scale bending/wrapping of upstream and downstream DNA as RPC advances to I1E, reducing -100/+14 distance to [~]75[A] and making RNAP-DNA contacts at -100 and +14. We propose that far-upstream DNA wraps on the upper {beta}-clamp while downstream DNA contacts the top of the {beta}-pincer in I1E. Converting I1E to I1M (~1s time-scale) reduces FRET efficiency with little change in -100/+14PIFE, interpreted as clamp-opening that moves far-upstream DNA (on {beta}) away from downstream DNA (on {beta}) to increase the -100/+14 distance by ~14[A]. FRET increases greatly in converting I1M to I1L, indicating bending of downstream duplex DNA into the clamp and clamp-closing to reduce the -100/+14 distance by ~21[A]. In the subsequent rate-determining DNA-opening step, in which the clamp may also open, I1L converts to the initial unstable OC (I2). Implications for facilitation of CC-to-OC isomerization by upstream DNA and upstream-binding, DNA-bending transcription activators are discussed.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=109 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/932780v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (23K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1068460org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dcd6d9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9d4727org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1aa8e47_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19 outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in China. Our findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "The popularity of the Common Green Iguana (Iguana iguana) as a pet has contributed to its global occurrence as an invasive alien species. Early detection and control of invasive alien I. iguana populations is necessary to prevent the need for large and financially demanding eradication actions. Here, we collated information from digital footage and interviews regarding sightings of free roaming I. iguana specimens in Singapore and Thailand, and present evidence of early-stage invasions and establishment. Using species distribution modeling, we find that large parts of Thailand and neighboring countries have suitable habitat, which could facilitate the expansion of these alien populations if left uncontrolled. Additionally, we report singular I. iguana sightings in Hong Kong and Peninsular Malaysia. We call for awareness of alien I. iguana in the Philippines due to the high number of pet iguanas and reported CITES importations as well as the availability of suitable habitat throughout the archipelago. Further, we identify I. iguana presence to be facilitated by the release of pet-traded specimens and uncontrolled exhibition practices in recreational parks. We provide recommendations for implementing monitoring and eradication efforts and strategy recommendations to halt future spread and release.",

    "abstract": "In many ways dogs are an ideal model for the study of genetic erosion and population recovery, problems of major concern in the field of conservation genetics. Genetic diversity in many dog breeds has been declining systematically since the beginning of the 1800s, when modern breeding practices came into fashion. As such, inbreeding in domestic dog breeds is substantial and widespread and has led to an increase in recessive deleterious mutations of high effect as well as general inbreeding depression. Pedigrees can in theory be used to guide breeding decisions, though are often incomplete and do not reflect the full history of inbreeding. Small microsatellite panels are also used in some cases to choose mating pairs to produce litters with low levels of inbreeding. However, the long-term impact of such practices have not been thoroughly evaluated. Here, we use forward simulation on a model of the dog genome to examine the impact of using limited markers panels to guide pairwise mating decisions on genome-wide population level genetic diversity. Our results suggest that in unsupervised mating schemes, where breeding decisions are made at the pairwise-rather than population-level, such panels can lead to accelerated loss of genetic diversity compared to random mating at regions of the genome unlinked to panel markers and demonstrate the importance of genome-wide genetic panels for managing and conserving genetic diversity in dogs and other companion animals.",

    "abstract": "The distinguishing practice of mindfulness meditation is the intentional regulation of attention towards the present moment. Mindfulness meditation therefore emphasizes metacognitive functions, in particular the ability to monitor the attentional focus on a moment-by-moment basis. In this study we set out to test whether mindfulness meditation experience is associated with an increased ability to monitor moment-by-moment fluctuation in the attentional state. In response to auditory cues, participants maintained somatosensory attention to either their left or right hand. At random moments, trials were terminated by a probe sound to which participants reported their level of attention at that moment. MEG was recorded during the attention interval preceding probe onset. Using a beamformer approach, alpha activity in contralateral primary somatosensory regions was quantified. Alpha activity for self-reported high versus low attention trials was compared both within and between groups of either highly experienced experienced mindfulness meditators, novice meditators or meditation-naive participants (controls). As predicted, generally contralateral alpha power was associated with self-reported attention. Novice meditators (< 1000 h of meditation) showed temporal profiles similar to controls, displaying a correspondence between self-report and alpha power preceding probe onset. Expert meditators (>> 1000 h) showed a strikingly different pattern, however. Their self-reported attentional state corresponded with alpha power during a more extended time interval preceding those of controls and novice meditators. In addition, self-reported low attention trials showed a distinctive alpha suppression preceding probe onset, suggesting that the ability for moment-by-moment monitoring of the attentional state permitted greater attentional control.",

    "abstract": "In many insects, repeated cold stress, characterized by warm periods that interrupt cold periods, have been found to yield survival benefits over continuous cold stress, but at the cost of reproduction. During cold stress, chill susceptible insects like Drosophila melanogaster suffer from a loss of ion and water balance, and the current model of recovery from chilling posits that re-establishment of ion homeostasis begins upon return to a warm environment, but that it takes minutes to hours for an insect to fully restore homeostasis. Following this ionoregulatory model of chill coma recovery, we predicted that the longer the duration of the warm periods between cold stresses, the better a fly will recover from a subsequent chill coma event and the more likely they will be to survive, but at the cost of fewer offspring. Here, female D. melanogaster were treated to a long continuous cold stress (25 h at 0{degrees}C), or experienced the same total time in the cold with repeated short (15 min), or long (120 min) breaks at 23{degrees}C. We found that warm periods in general improved survival outcomes, and individuals that recovered for more time in between cold periods had significantly lower rates of injury, faster recovery from chill coma, and produced greater, rather than fewer, offspring. These improvements in chill tolerance were associated with mitigation of ionoregulatory collapse, as flies that experienced either short or long warm periods better maintained low hemolymph [K+]. Thus, warm periods that interrupt cold exposures improve cold tolerance and fertility in D. melanogaster females relative to a single sustained cold stress, potentially because this time allows for recovery of ion and water homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Reproductive conflicts are common in insect societies where helping castes retain reproductive potential. One of the mechanisms regulating the conflicts is policing, a coercive behavior that reduces direct reproduction by other individuals. In eusocial Hymenoptera (ants, bees, and wasps), workers or the queen act aggressively toward fertile workers, or destroy their eggs. In many termite species (order Blattodea), upon the death of primary queen and king, workers or nymphs can differentiate into neotenic reproductives and inherit the breeding position. During this process, competition among neotenics is inevitable, but how this conflict is resolved remains unclear. Here, we report a policing behavior that regulates reproductive division of labor in the eastern subterranean termite, Reticulitermes flavipes. Our results demonstrate that the policing behavior is a cooperative effort performed sequentially by successful neotenics and workers. A neotenic reproductive initiates the attack of the fellow neotenic by biting and displays alarm behavior. Workers are then recruited to cannibalize the injured neotenic. Furthermore, the initiation of policing is age-dependent, with older reproductives attacking younger ones, thereby inheriting the reproductive position. This study provides empirical evidence of policing behavior in termites, which represents a convergent trait shared between eusocial Hymenoptera and Blattodea.",

    "abstract": "The CRISPR-Cas9 system is widely used for target-specific genome engineering. Cpf1 is one of the CRISPR effectors that controls target genes by recognizing thymine-rich protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences. Cpf1 has a higher sensitivity to mismatches in the guide RNA than does Cas9; therefore, off-target sequence recognition and cleavage are lower. However, it tolerates mismatches in regions distant from the PAM sequence (TTTN or TTN) in the protospacer, and off-target cleavage issues may become more problematic when Cpf1 activity is improved for therapeutic purposes. In our study, we investigated off-target cleavage by Cpf1 and modified the Cpf1 (cr)RNA to address the off-target cleavage issue. We developed a CRISPR-Cpf1 that can induce mutations in target DNA sequences in a highly specific and effective manner by partially substituting the (cr)RNA with DNA to change the energy potential of base pairing to the target DNA. A model to explain how chimeric (cr)RNA guided CRISPR-Cpf1 and SpCas9 nickase effectively work in the intracellular genome is suggested. In our results, CRISPR-Cpf1 induces less off-target mutations at the cell level, when chimeric DNA-RNA guide was used for genome editing. This study has a potential for therapeutic applications in incurable diseases caused by genetic mutation.",

Intrinsically disordered FG-Nups line the NPC lumen and form a selective barrier, where transport of most proteins is inhibited whereas specific transporter proteins freely pass. The mechanism underlying selective transport through the NPC is still debated. Here, we reconstitute the selective behaviour of the NPC bottom-up by introducing a rationally designed artificial FG-Nup that mimics natural Nups. Using QCM-D, we measure a strong affinity of the artificial FG-Nup brushes to the transport receptor Kap95, whereas no binding occurs to cytosolic proteins such as BSA. Solid-state nanopores with the artificial FG-Nups lining their inner walls support fast translocation of Kap95 while blocking BSA, thus demonstrating selectivity. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations highlight the formation of a selective meshwork with densities comparable to native NPCs. Our findings show that simple design rules can recapitulate the selective behaviour of native FG-Nups and demonstrate that no specific spacer sequence nor a spatial segregation of different FG-motif types are needed to create functional NPCs.",

Thereby, we overcome the loss of protein function observed after direct fusion to a ciliary targeting sequence. We functionally localized modifiers of cAMP signaling, i.e. the photo-activated adenylate cyclase bPAC and the light-activated phosphodiesterase LAPD, as well as the cAMP biosensor mlCNBD-FRET to the cilium.

    "abstract": "The oceans are in a state of rapid change - both negatively, due climate destabilization and misuse, and positively, due to strengthening of policies for sustainable use combined with momentum to grow the blue economy. Globally, more than 121 million people enjoy nature-based marine tourism -- e.g., recreational fishing, diving, whale watching -- making it one of the largest marine sectors. This industry is increasingly threatened by ocean degradation and management has not kept pace to ensure long-term sustainability. In response, individuals within the industry are taking it upon themselves to monitor the oceans and provide the data needed to assist management decisions. Fiji is one such place where the dive tourism industry is motivated to monitor the oceans (e.g., track sharks). In 2012, 39 dive operators in collaboration with eOceans commenced the Great Fiji Shark Count (GFSC) to document sharks (and other species) on 592 dive sites. Here, using 146,304 shark observations from 30,668 dives we document spatial patterns of 11 shark species. High variability demonstrates the value of longitudinal data that include absences for describing mobile megafauna and the capacity of stakeholders to document the oceans. Our results may be used to guide future scientific questions, provide a baseline for future assessments, or to evaluate conservation needs. It also shows the value of scientists collaborating with stakeholders to address questions that are most important to the local community so that they have the information needed to make science-based decisions.",

    "abstract": "The biodiverse Neotropical ecoregion remains insufficiently assessed, poorly managed, and threatened by unregulated human activities. Novel, rapid and cost-effective DNA-based approaches are valuable to improve understanding of the biological communities and for biomonitoring in remote areas. Here, we evaluate the potential of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding for assessing the structure and distribution of fish communities by analysing sediments and water from 11 locations along the Jequitinhonha River catchment (Brazil). Each site was sampled twice, before and after a major rain event in a five-week period and fish diversity was estimated using high-through-put sequencing of 12S rRNA amplicons. In total, 252 Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs) and 34 fish species were recovered, including endemic, introduced, and previously unrecorded species for this basin. Spatio-temporal variation of fish assemblages was detected, richness during the first campaign was nearly twice as high as in the second sampling round; though peaks of diversity were primarily associated with only four locations. No correlation between {beta}-diversity and longitudinal distance or presence of dams was detected, but low species richness observed at sites located near dams indicates that these anthropogenic barriers might have an impact on local fish diversity. Unexpectedly high -diversity levels recorded at the river mouth suggest that these sections should be further evaluated as putative \"eDNA reservoirs\" for rapid monitoring. By uncovering spatio-temporal changes, unrecorded biodiversity components, and putative anthropogenic impacts on fish assemblages, we further strengthen the potential of eDNA metabarcoding as a biomonitoring tool, especially in regions often neglected or difficult to access.",

In all cases, we discovered new gene expression patterns associated with histological structures. In the TME, this demonstrated a trajectory of myeloid and T cell differentiation, from periphery inward. A variation of ZipSeq efficiently scales to the level of single cells, providing a pathway for complete mapping of live tissues, subsequent to real-time imaging or perturbation.",

    "abstract": "Rapid antibacterial susceptibility testing (RAST) methods which measure change of a bacterial phenotype in response to a given treatment are of significant importance in healthcare, as they can assist care-givers in timely administration of the right treatment. Various RAST techniques have been reported for tracking bacterial phenotypes, such as size, shape, motion, and metabolic activity. However, they still require bulky and expensive instruments (which hinders their application in resource-limited environments) and/or utilize labeling reagents (which can interfere with antibiotics and add to cost). Furthermore, the existing ultra-rapid methods do not address possible adaptation of gradual adaptation of bacteria to antibiotics, which can lead to false interpretation of resistance when using ultra-rapid methods. In this work, we present a RAST approach leveraging machine learning analysis of time-resolved dynamic laser speckle imaging (DLSI) results to accurately predict the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of a model strain of Escherichia coli in 60 minutes, compared to 6 hours using the currently FDA-approved phenotype-based RAST technique. To demonstrate the DLSI performance, we studied the effect of a {beta}-lactam ampicillin and an aminoglycoside gentamicin on Escherichia coli strain K-12. DLSI captures change of bacterial motion/division in response to treatment. The machine learning algorithm was trained and validated using the overnight results of gold standard, broth microdilution method. Empowered by machine learning, DyRAST can predict MIC with high accuracy comparable to gold standard methods through a voting strategy.",

    "abstract": "Soil-borne beneficial microbes establish symbioses with plant hosts, and play key roles during growth and development therein. In this study, fungal strains FLP7 and B9 were isolated from the rhizosphere microbiome associated with Choy Sum (Brassica rapa var. parachinen-sis) and barley (Hordeum vulgare), respectively. Sequence analyses of the internal transcribed spacer and 18S ribosomal RNA genes combined with colony and conidial morphology identified FLP7 and B9 to be isolates of Penicillium citrinum. Plant-fungus interaction assays revealed that B9, but not FLP7, showed significant growth promotion effect in Choy Sum cultivated in normal soil, whereas FLP7 enhanced Choy Sum growth under phosphate-limiting condition. In comparison to the mock control, B9-inoculated plants showed a 34% increase in growth in aerial parts, and an 85% upsurge in the fresh weight of roots when cultivated in sterilized soil. The dry biomass of inoculated Choy Sum increased by 39% and 74% for the shoots and roots, respectively. Root colonization assays showed that P. citrinum associates directly with the root surface but does not enter/invade the roots of inoculated Choy Sum plants. Preliminary results also indicated that P. citrinum can promote growth in Choy Sum via volatile metabolites too. Interestingly, we detected relatively higher amounts of indole acetic acid and cytokinins in axenic P. citrinum culture filtrate through liquid-chromatography mass-spectrometry analyses. This could plausibly explain the overall growth promotion in Choy Sum. Furthermore, the phenotypic growth defects associated with the Arabidopsis ga1 mutant could be chemically complemented by the exogenous application of P. citrinum culture filtrate, which also showed accumulation of fungus-derived active gibberellins. Our study underscores the importance of trans-kingdom beneficial effects of such mycobiome-derived phytohormone-like metabolites in host plant growth.",

    "abstract": "Resistance to artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) in the Plasmodium falciparum parasite is threatening to reverse recent gains in reducing global deaths from malaria. Whilst resistance manifests as delayed asexual parasite clearance in patients following ACT treatment, the phenotype can only spread geographically via the sexual cycle and subsequent transmission through the mosquito. Artemisinin and its derivatives (such as dihydroartemisinin, DHA) as well as killing the asexual parasite form are known to sterilize male, sexual-stage gametes from activation. Whether resistant parasites overcome this artemisinin-dependent sterilizing effect has not, however, been fully tested. Here, we analysed five P. falciparum clinical isolates from the Greater Mekong Subregion, each of which demonstrated delayed clinical clearance and carried known resistance-associated polymorphisms in the Kelch13 gene (PfK13var). As well as demonstrating reduced sensitivity to artemisinin-derivates in in vitro asexual growth assays, certain PfK13var isolates also demonstrated a marked reduction in sensitivity to these drugs in an in vitro male gamete activation assay compared to a sensitive control. Importantly, the same reduction in sensitivity to DHA was observed when the most resistant isolate was assayed by standard membrane feeding assays using Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. These results indicate that ACT use can favour resistant over sensitive parasite transmission. A selective advantage for resistant parasite transmission could also favour acquisition of further polymorphisms, such as mosquito host-specificity or antimalarial partner-drug resistance in mixed infections. Favoured transmission of resistance under ACT coverage could have profound implications for the spread of multidrug resistant malaria beyond Southeast Asia.\n\nONE SENTENCE SUMMARYArtemisinin-resistant clinical isolates can also demonstrate resistance to the transmission-blocking effects of artemisinin-based drugs, favouring resistance transmission to the mosquito.",

MiRNAs are a class of endogenously non-coding small RNAs (21-24 nt) that play key roles in the regulation of various growth and developmental processes in plants. The knowledge miRNA-guided CMS regulation is rather limited in pepper. To better understand the miRNAs involvement and regulatory mechanism of CMS, miRNA libraries from anther of CMS-line N816S and its maintainer line Ning5m were generated by miRNAome sequencing in pepper. A total of 76 differentially expressed miRNAs were detected, of which 18 miRNAs were further confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). In addition, miRNA targets were identified by degradome sequencing. The result showed that 1292 targets that were potentially cleaved by 321 miRNAs (250 conserved miRNAs and 71 novel miRNAs). Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analysis indicated that 35 differentially expressed miRNAs might play roles in the regulation of CMS sterility, by cleaving 77 target transcripts, such as MYBs, SPLs, and AFRs, of which targeted by miR156, miR167, miRNA858 family. Nineteen miRNA-cleaved targets were selectively examined by qRT-PCR, and the results showed that there were mostly negative correlations between miRNAs and their targets on the expression level.

    "abstract": "Knowing the structure of conserved structural RNAs is important to elucidate their function and mechanism of action. However, predicting a conserved RNA structure remains unreliable, even when using a combination of thermodynamic stability and evolutionary covariation information. Here we present a method to predict a conserved RNA structure that combines the following three features. First, it uses significant covariation due to RNA structure and removes spurious covariation due to phylogeny. Second, it uses negative evolutionary information: basepairs that have variation but no significant covariation are prevented from occurring. Lastly, it uses a battery of probabilistic folding algorithms that incorporate all positive covariation into one structure. The method, named CaCoFold (Cascade variation/covariation Constrained Folding algorithm), predicts a nested structure guided by a maximal subset of positive basepairs, and recursively incorporates all remaining positive basepairs into alternative helices. The alternative helices can be compatible with the nested structure such as pseudoknots, or overlapping such as competing structures, base triplets, or other 3D non-antiparallel interactions. We present evidence that CaCoFold predictions are consistent with structures modeled from crystallography.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe availability of deeper comparative sequence alignments and recent advances in statistical analysis of RNA sequence covariation have made it possible to identify a reliable set of conserved base pairs, as well as a reliable set of non-basepairs (positions that vary without covarying). Predicting an overall consensus secondary structure consistent with a set of individual inferred pairs and non-pairs remains a problem. Current RNA structure prediction algorithms that predict nested secondary structures cannot use the full set of inferred covarying pairs, because covariation analysis also identifies important non-nested pairing interactions such as pseudoknots, base triples, and alternative structures. Moreover, although algorithms for incorporating negative constraints exist, negative information from covariation analysis (inferred non-pairs) has not been systematically exploited.\n\nHere I introduce an efficient approximate RNA structure prediction algorithm that incorporates all inferred pairs and excludes all non-pairs. Using this, and an improved visualization tool, I show that the method correctly identifies many non-nested structures in agreement with known crystal structures, and improves many curated consensus secondary structure annotations in RNA sequence alignment databases.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we analyze the dynamical behavior of the tumor suppressor protein p53, an essential player in the cellular stress response, which prevents a cell from dividing if severe DNA damage is present. When this response system is malfunctioning, e.g. due to mutations in p53, uncontrolled cell proliferation may lead to the development of cancer. Understanding the behavior of p53 is thus crucial to prevent its failing. It has been shown in various experiments that periodicity of the p53 signal is one of the main descriptors of its dynamics, and that its pulsing behavior (regular vs. spontaneous) indicates the level and type of cellular stress. In the present work, we introduce an algorithm to score the local periodicity of a given time series (such as the p53 signal), which we call Detrended Autocorrelation Periodicity Scoring (DAPS). It applies pitch detection (via autocorrelation) on sliding windows of the entire time series to describe the overall periodicity by a distribution of localized pitch scores. We apply DAPS to the p53 time series obtained from single cell experiments and establish a correlation between the periodicity scoring of a cells p53 signal and the number of cell division events. In particular, we show that high periodicity scoring of p53 is correlated to a low number of cell divisions and vice versa. We show similar results with a more computationally intensive state-of-the-art periodicity scoring algorithm based on topology known as Sw1PerS. This correlation has two major implications: It demonstrates that periodicity scoring of the p53 signal is a good descriptor for cellular stress, and it connects the high variability of p53 periodicity observed in cell populations to the variability in the number of cell division events.\n\nAMS subject classification92C42, 92C37, 62M10",

    "abstract": "Correct regulation of cell contractility is critical for the function of many biological systems. The reproductive system of the hermaphroditic nematode C. elegans contains a contractile tube of myoepithelial cells known as the spermatheca, which stores sperm and is the site of oocyte fertilization. Regulated contraction of the spermatheca pushes the embryo into the uterus. Cell contractility in the spermatheca is dependent on actin and myosin and is regulated, in part, by Ca2+ signaling through the phospholipase PLC-1, which mediates Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum. Here, we describe a novel role for GSA-1/Gs, and protein kinase A, composed of the catalytic subunit KIN-1/PKA-C and the regulatory subunit KIN-2/PKA-R, in the regulation of Ca2+ release and contractility in the C. elegans spermatheca. Without GSA-1/Gs or KIN-1/PKA-C, Ca2+ is not released, and oocytes become trapped in the spermatheca. Conversely, when PKA is activated through either a gain of function allele in GSA-1 (GSA-1(GF)) or by depletion of KIN-2/PKA-R, Ca2+ is increased, and waves of Ca2+ travel across the spermatheca even in the absence of oocyte entry. In the spermathecal-uterine valve, loss of GSA-1/Gs or KIN-1/PKA-C results in sustained, high levels of Ca2+ and a loss of coordination between the spermathecal bag and sp-ut valve. Additionally, we show that depleting phosphodiesterase PDE-6 levels alters contractility and Ca2+ dynamics in the spermatheca, and that the GPB-1 and GPB-2 G{beta} subunits play a central role in regulating spermathecal contractility and Ca2+ signaling. This work identifies a signaling network in which Ca2+ and cAMP pathways work together to coordinate spermathecal contractility.\n\nAuthor SummaryOrganisms are full of biological tubes that transport substances such as food, liquids, and air through the body. Moving these substances in a coordinated manner, with the correct directionality, timing, and rate is critical for organism health. In this study we used Caenorhabditis elegans, a small transparent worm, to study how cells in biological tubes coordinate how and when they squeeze and relax. The C. elegans spermatheca is part of the reproductive system, which uses calcium signaling to drive the coordinated contractions that push fertilized eggs out into the uterus. Using genetic analysis and a calcium-sensitive fluorescent protein, we show that the G-protein GSA-1 functions with protein kinase A to regulate calcium release, and contraction of the spermatheca. These findings establish a link between G-protein and cAMP signaling that may apply to similar signaling pathways in other systems.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSex and social context are two major factors in the development of depression and other stress-related disorders. However, few studies of the effects of stress on rodent behavior and physiology have investigated social context and fewer still have assessed the possibility of sex-specific effects of social context.\n\nMethodsWe assessed social dominance of group-living mice during several days of monitoring using a high-throughput automated behavioral tracking system. We then exposed groups from each sex to a three-week chronic mild stress (CMS) procedure, followed by a behavioral test battery. Finally, we used principle component analysis and post-hoc tests to explore the sources of variance in the behavioral outcome data.\n\nResultsWe found stable hierarchies in both sexes, however social dominance in males exhibited several additional associations with behaviors related to locomotion and exploration that were not seen in females. Crucially, pre-stress social dominance status was associated with opposing outcomes on multiple behavioral readouts between the two sexes following CMS. In particular, subordinate male mice and dominant female mice appeared more responsive to the environmental challenge, as observed in anxiety-like and locomotor behaviors.\n\nConclusionsThis work demonstrates that sex differences interact with preexisting social dominance status to alter the effects of chronic stress.

    "abstract": "Introduction: Retinal implants have now been approved and commercially available for certain clinical populations for over 5 years, with hundreds of individuals implanted, scores of them closely followed in research trials. Despite these numbers, however, few data are available that would help us answer basic questions regarding the nature and outcomes of artificial vision: what do participants see when the device is turned on for the first time, and how does that change over time?\n\nMethods: Semi-structured interviews and observations were undertaken at two sites in France and the UK with 16 participants who had received either the Argus II or IRIS II devices. Data were collected at various time points in the process that implant recipients went through in receiving and learning to use the device, including initial evaluation, implantation, initial activation and systems fitting, re-education and finally post-education. These data were supplemented with data from interviews conducted with vision rehabilitation specialists at the clinical sites and clinical researchers at the device manufacturers (Second Sight and Pixium Vision). Observational and interview data were transcribed, coded and analyzed using an approach guided by Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA).\n\nResults: Implant recipients described the perceptual experience produced by their epiretinal implants as fundamentally, qualitatively different than natural vision. All used terms that invoked electrical stimuli to describe the appearance of their percepts, yet the characteristics used to describe the percepts varied significantly between participants. Artificial vision for these participants was a highly specific, learned skill-set that combined particular bodily techniques, associative learning and deductive reasoning in order to build a \"lexicon of flashes\" - a distinct perceptual vocabulary that they then used to decompose, recompose and interpret their surroundings. The percept did not transform over time; rather, the participant became better at interpreting the signals they received. The process of using the device never ceased to be cognitively fatiguing, and did not come without risk or cost to the participant. In exchange, participants received hope and purpose through participation, as well as a new kind of sensory signal that may not have afforded practical or functional use in daily life but, for some, provided a kind of \"contemplative perception\" that participants tailored to individualized activities.\n\nConclusion: Attending to the qualitative reports of participants regarding the experience of artificial vision provides valuable information not captured by extant clinical outcome measures. These data can both inform device design and rehabilitative techniques, as well as grant a more holistic understanding of the phenomenon of artificial vision.",

In addition, we found that Raf22, another C-type Raf-like kinase, functions partially redundantly with Raf36 to regulate ABA responses. Comparative phosphoproteomic analysis using Arabidopsis wild-type and raf22raf36-1 plants identified proteins that are phosphorylated downstream of Raf36 and Raf22 in planta.

Scalability is the key factor in learning and processing massive networks within reasonable time; for a maintainable software open to new functionalities, extensibility and interoperability are necessary. Ease of use and interpretability are fundamental aspects of model interpretation, fairly similar to the case of the recent explainable artificial intelligence trend.

They consist of hundreds of proteins called nucleoporins (Nups) that assemble in multiple copies to fuse the inner and outer nuclear membranes. Elucidating the molecular function and architecture of NPCs imposes a formidable challenge and requires the convergence of in vitro and in situ approaches. How exactly NPC architecture accommodates processes such as mRNA export or NPC assembly and turnover inside of cells remains poorly understood. Here we combine integrated in situ structural biology, correlative light and electron microscopy with yeast genetics to structurally analyze NPCs within the native context of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells under conditions of starvation and exponential growth. We find an unanticipated in situ layout of nucleoporins with respect to overall dimensions and conformation of the NPC scaffold that could not have been predicted from previous in vitro analysis. Particularly striking is the configuration of the Nup159 complex, which appears critical to spatially accommodate not only mRNA export but also NPC turnover by selective autophagy. We capture structural snapshots of NPC turnover, revealing that it occurs through nuclear envelope herniae and NPC-containing nuclear vesicles. Our study provides the basis for understanding the various membrane remodeling events that happen at the interface of the nuclear envelope with the autophagy apparatus and emphasizes the need of investigating macromolecular complexes in their cellular context.",

    "abstract": "Ecological community structure, persistence and stability are shaped by multiple forces, acting on multiple scales. These include patterns of resource use and limitation, spatial heterogeneities, drift and migration. Pathogen strains co-circulating in a host population are a special type of an ecological community. They compete for colonization of susceptible hosts, and sometimes interact via altered susceptibilities to co-colonization. Diversity in such pairwise interaction traits enables the multiple strains to create dynamically their niches for growth and persistence, and  engineer their common environment. How such a network of interactions with others mediates collective coexistence remains puzzling analytically and computationally difficult to simulate. Furthermore, the gradients modulating stability-complexity regimes in such multi-player systems remain poorly understood. In a recent study, we presented an analytic framework for N-type coexistence in an SIS epidemiological system with co-colonization interactions. The multi-strain complexity was reduced from O(N2) dimensions of population structure to only N equations for strain frequency evolution on a long timescale. Here, we examine the key drivers of coexistence regimes in such a system. We find the ratio of single to co-colonization  critically determines the type of equilibrium for multi-strain dynamics. This key quantity in the model encodes a trade-off between overall transmission intensity R0 and mean interaction coefficient in strain space k. Preserving a given coexistence regime, under fixed trait variation, can only be achieved from a balance between higher competition in favourable environments, and higher cooperation in harsher environments, consistent with the stress gradient hypothesis in ecology. Multi-strain coexistence regimes are more stable when  is small, whereas as  increases, dynamics tends to increase in complexity. There is an intermediate ratio that maximizes the existence and stability of a unique coexistence equilibrium between strains. This framework provides a foundation for linking invariant principles in collective coexistence across biological systems, and for understanding critical shifts in community dynamics, driven by simple and random pairwise interactions but potentiated by mean-field and environmental gradients.",

    "abstract": "Successful mathematical modeling of biological processes relies on the expertise of the modeler to capture the essential mechanisms in the process at hand and on the ability to extract useful information from empirical data. The very structure of the model limits the ability to infer numerical values for the parameters, a concept referred to as structural identifiability. Most of the available methods to test the structural identifiability of a model are either too complex mathematically for the general practitioner to be applied, or require involved calculations or numerical computation for complex non-linear models. In this work, we present a new analytical method to test structural identifiability of models based on ordinary differential equations, based on the invariance of the equations under the scaling transformation of its parameters. The method is based on rigorous mathematical results but it is easy and quick to apply, even to test the identifiability of sophisticated highly non-linear models. We illustrate our method by example and compare its performance with other existing methods in the literature.\n\nAuthor summaryTheoretical Biology is a useful approach to explain, generate hypotheses, or discriminate among competing theories. A well-formulated model has to be complex enough to capture the relevant mechanisms of the problem, and simple enough to be fitted to data. Structural identifiability tests aim to recognize, in advance, if the structure of the model allows parameter fitting even with unlimited high-quality data. Available methods require advanced mathematical skills, or are too costly for high-dimensional non-linear models. We propose an analytical method based on scale invariance of the equations. It provides definite answers to the structural identifiability problem while being simple enough to be performed in a few lines of calculations without any computational aid. It favorably compares with other existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Taxonomy of living organisms gains major importance in making the study of vastly heterogeneous living things easier. In addition, various fields of applied biology (e.g., agriculture) depend on classification of living creatures. Specific fragments of the DNA sequence of a living organism have been defined as DNA barcodes and can be used as markers to identify species efficiently and effectively. The existing DNA barcode-based classification approaches suffer from three major issues: (i) most of them assume that the classification is done within a given taxonomic class and/or input sequences are prealigned, (ii) highly performing classifiers, such as SVM, cannot scale to large taxonomies due to high memory requirements, (iii) mutations and noise in input DNA sequences greatly reduce the taxonomic classification accuracy. In order to address these issues, we propose a multi-level hierarchical classifier framework to automatically assign taxonomy labels to DNA sequences. We utilize an alignment-free approach called spectrum kernel method for feature extraction. We build a proof-of-concept hierarchical classifier with two levels, and evaluated it on real DNA sequence data from BOLD systems. We demonstrate that the proposed framework provides higher accuracy than regular classifiers. Besides, hierarchical framework scales better to large datasets enabling researchers to employ classifiers with high accuracy and high memory requirement on large datasets. Furthermore, we show that the proposed framework is more robust to mutations and noise in sequence data than the non-hierarchical classifiers.",

    "abstract": "Genetic and genomic architectures of traits under selection are key factors influencing evolutionary responses. Yet, knowledge of their impacts has been limited by a widespread assumption that most traits are controlled by unlinked polygenic architectures. Recent advances in genome sequencing and eco-evolutionary modelling are unlocking the potential for integrating genomic information into predictions of population responses to environmental change. Using eco-evolutionary simulations, we demonstrate that hypothetical single-locus control of a life history trait produces highly variable and unpredictable harvesting-induced evolution relative to the classically applied multi-locus model. Single-locus control of complex traits is thought to be uncommon, yet blocks of linked genes, such as those associated with some types of structural genomic variation, have emerged as taxonomically widespread phenomena. Inheritance of linked architectures resembles that of single loci, thus enabling single-locus-like modeling of polygenic adaptation. Yet, the number of loci, their effect sizes, and the degree of linkage among them all occur along a continuum. We review how linked architectures are often associated, directly or indirectly, with traits expected to be under selection from anthropogenic stressors and are likely to play a large role in adaptation to environmental disturbance. We suggest using single-locus models to explore evolutionary extremes and uncertainties when the trait architecture is unknown, refining parameters as genomic information becomes available, and explicitly incorporating linkage among loci when possible. By overestimating the complexity (e.g., number of independent loci) of the genomic architecture of traits under selection, we risk underestimating the complexity (e.g., nonlinearity) of their evolutionary dynamics.",

    "abstract": "A large number of putative risk genes of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been reported. The functions of most of these susceptibility genes in developing brains remain unknown, and a causal relationship between their variations and autism traits has not been established. The aim of this study is to predict putative risk genes at the whole-genome level based on the analysis of gene co-expression with a group of high confidence ASD risk genes (hcASDs). Results showed that three gene features, including gene size, mRNA abundance, and guanine-cytosine content, affect genome-wide co-expression profiles of hcASDs. To circumvent the interference of these gene features on gene co-expression analysis (GCA), we developed a method to determine whether a gene is significantly co-expressed with hcASDs by statistically comparing the co-expression profile of this gene with hcASDs to that of this gene with permuted gene sets of feature-matched genes. This method is referred to as \"matched-gene co-expression analysis\" (MGCA). With MGCA, we demonstrated the convergence in developmental expression profiles of hcASDs and improved the efficacy of risk gene prediction. Results of analysis of two recently reported ASD candidate genes, CDH11 and CDH9, suggested the involvement of CDH11, but not CDH9, in ASD. Consistent with this prediction, behavioral studies showed that Cdh11-null mice, but not Cdh9-null mice, have multiple autism-like behavioral alterations. This study highlighted the power of MGCA in revealing ASD-associated genes and the potential role of CDH11 in ASD.",

    "abstract": "Environmental changes cause stress, Reactive Oxygen Species and unfolded protein accumulation which hamper synaptic activity and trigger cell death. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) assist protein refolding to maintain proteostasis and cellular integrity. Mechanisms regulating the activity of HSPs include transcription factors and posttranslational modifications that ensure a rapid response. HSPs preserve synaptic function in the nervous system upon environmental insults or pathological factors and contribute to the coupling between environmental cues and neuron control of development. We have performed a biased screening in Drosophilamelanogaster searching for synaptogenic modulators among HSPs during development. We explore the role of two small-HSPs (sHSPs), sHSP23 and sHSP26 in synaptogenesis and neuronal activity. Both sHSPs immunoprecipitate together and the equilibrium between both chaperones is required for neuronal development and activity. The molecular mechanism controlling HSP23 and HSP26 accumulation in neurons relies on a novel gene (CG1561), which we name Pinkman (pkm). We propose that sHSPs and Pkm are targets to modulate the impact of stress in neurons and to prevent synapse loss.",

    "abstract": "Classical mouse embryology has established a paradigm of early development driven by sequential lineage bifurcations. Accordingly, mouse embryonic stem cells derived from early epiblast have lost the potency to produce extraembryonic trophectoderm. We show in contrast that human naive epiblast cells readily make trophectoderm. Inhibition of ERK signalling, instrumental in naive stem cell propagation, unexpectedly potentiates trophectoderm formation, an effect enhanced by Nodal inhibition. Transcriptome analyses authenticate conversion into trophectoderm with subsequent production of syncitiotrophoblast, cytotrophoblast and trophoblast stem cells. Genetic perturbations indicate that NANOG suppresses and TFAP2C enables trophectoderm induction. Consistent with post-implantation progression, trophectoderm potential is extinguished in conventional human pluripotent stem cells, which instead make amnion. Finally, human embryo epiblasts from late blastocysts efficiently generate trophectoderm and differentiated trophoblast. Thus, pluripotent cells in the human embryo retain extraembryonic lineage plasticity and regenerative potential until implantation. Harnessing this unanticipated regulative capacity may be beneficial for assisted reproduction technology.",

    "abstract": "Geothermal systems emit substantial amounts of aqueous, gaseous and methylated mercury, but little is known about microbial influences on mercury speciation. Here we report results from genome-resolved metagenomics and mercury speciation analysis of acid warm springs in the Ngawha Geothermal Field (<55 {degrees}C, pH < 4.5), Northland Region, Aotearoa (New Zealand). Our aim was to identify the microorganisms genetically equipped for mercury methylation, demethylation, or Hg(II) reduction to volatile Hg(0) in these springs. Dissolved total and methylated mercury concentrations in two adjacent springs with different mercury speciation ranked among the highest reported from natural sources (250-16000 ng L-1 and 0.5-13.9 ng L-1, respectively). Total solid mercury concentrations in spring sediments ranged from 1273 to 7000 {micro}g g-1. In the context of such ultra-high mercury levels, the geothermal microbiome was unexpectedly diverse, and dominated by acidophilic and mesophilic sulfur- and iron-cycling bacteria, mercury- and arsenic-resistant bacteria, and thermophilic and acidophilic archaea. Integrating microbiome structure and metagenomic potential with geochemical constraints, we constructed a conceptual model for biogeochemical mercury cycling in geothermal springs. The model includes abiotic and biotic controls on mercury speciation, and illustrates how geothermal mercury cycling may couple to microbial community dynamics and sulfur and iron biogeochemistry.\n\nIMPORTANCELittle is currently known about biogeochemical mercury cycling in geothermal systems. This manuscript presents an important new conceptual model, supported by genome-resolved metagenomic analysis and detailed geochemical measurements. This work provides a framework for studying natural geothermal mercury emissions globally. Specifically, our findings have implications for mercury speciation in wastewaters from geothermal power plants and the potential environmental impacts of microbially and abiotically formed mercury species, particularly where mobilized in spring waters that mix with surface- or ground-waters. Furthermore, in the context of thermophilic origins for microbial mercury volatilisation, this report yields new insights into how such processes may have evolved alongside microbial mercury methylation/demethylation, and the environmental constraints imposed by the geochemistry and mineralogy of geothermal systems.",

Florigen family transcriptional co-regulators TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) antagonistically regulate these vital processes 4-6 yet how TFL1 and FT execute their roles and what the mechanism is for their antagonism remains poorly understood. We show genome-wide, that TFL1 is recruited to the chromatin by the bZIP transcription factor FLOWERING LOCUS D (FD) in Arabidopsis. We find that seasonal cue-mediated upregulation of FT competes TFL1 from chromatin-bound FD at key target loci. We identify the master regulator of floral fate, LEAFY (LFY) as a target under dual opposite regulation by TFL1 and FT. Exonic bZIP motifs in LFY are critical for repression by TFL1, upregulation by FT and adoption of floral fate. Transcriptomic identification of target genes directly repressed by the TFL1-FD complex not only identifies key regulators of onset of reproduction and floral fate, but reveals that TFL1-FD repress sugar and hormone signalling pathways and chromatin regulators.

PD pathogenesis has been largely investigated, but either restricted in bulk level or at certain cell types, which failed to capture cellular heterogeneity and intrinsic interplays among distinct cell types. To overcome this, we applied single-nucleus RNA-seq and single cell ATAC-seq on cerebellum, midbrain and striatum of PD mouse and matched control. With 74,493 cells in total, we comprehensively depicted the dysfunctions under PD pathology covering proteostasis, neuroinflammation, calcium homeostasis and extracellular neurotransmitter homeostasis. Besides, by multi-omics approach, we identified putative biomarkers for early stage of PD, based on the relationships between transcriptomic and epigenetic profiles. We located certain cell types that primarily contribute to PD early pathology, narrowing the gap between genotypes and phenotypes. Taken together, our study provides a valuable resource to dissect the molecular mechanism of PD pathogenesis at single cell level, which could facilitate the development of novel methods regarding diagnosis, monitoring and practical therapies against PD at early stage.",

    "abstract": "Increased intraocular pressure (IOP) represents a major risk factor for glaucoma, a prevalent eye disease characterized by death of retinal ganglion cells that carry information from the eye to the brain; lowering IOP is the only proven treatment strategy to delay disease progression. The main determinant of IOP is the equilibrium between production and drainage of aqueous humor, with compromised drainage generally viewed as the primary contributor to dangerous IOP elevations. Drainage occurs through two pathways in the anterior segment of the eye, called conventional and uveoscleral. To gain insights into the cell types that comprise these pathways, we used high-throughput single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). From [~]24,000 single cell transcriptomes, we identified 19 cell types with molecular markers for each and used histological methods to localize each type. We then performed similar analyses on four organisms used for experimental studies of IOP dynamics and glaucoma: cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis), rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta), pig (Sus scrofa) and mouse (Mus musculus). Many human cell types had counterparts in these models, but differences in cell types and gene expression were evident. Finally, we identified the cell types that express genes implicated in glaucoma in all five species. Together, our results provide foundations for investigating the pathogenesis of glaucoma, and for using model systems to assess mechanisms and potential interventions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn cancer, normal epigenetic patterns are disturbed and contribute to gene expression changes, disease onset and progression. The cancer epigenome is composed of the epigenetic patterns present in the tumor-initiating cell at the time of transformation, and the tumor-specific epigenetic alterations that are acquired during tumor initiation and progression. The precise dissection of these two components of the tumor epigenome will facilitate a better understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying malignant transformation. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) originates from differentiating B cells, which undergo extensive epigenetic programming. This poses the challenge to precisely determine the epigenomic ground-state of the cell-of-origin in order to identify CLL-specific epigenetic aberrations.\n\nMethodsWe developed a linear regression model, methylome-based cell-of-origin modeling (Methyl-COOM), to map the cell-of-origin for individual CLL patients based on the continuum of epigenomic changes during normal B cell differentiation.\n\nResultsMethyl-COOM accurately maps the cell-of-origin of CLL and identifies CLL-specific aberrant DNA methylation events that are not confounded by physiologic epigenetic B cell programming. Furthermore, Methyl-COOM unmasks abnormal action of transcription factors, altered super-enhancer activities, and aberrant transcript expression in CLL. Among the aberrantly regulated transcripts were many genes that have previously been implicated in T cell biology. Flow cytometry analysis of these markers confirmed their aberrant expression on malignant B cells at the protein level.\n\nConclusionsMethyl-COOM analysis of CLL identified disease-specific aberrant gene regulation. The aberrantly expressed genes identified in this study might play a role in immune-evasion in CLL and might serve as novel targets for immunotherapy approaches. In summary, we propose a novel framework for in silico modeling of reference DNA methylomes and for the identification of cancer-specific epigenetic changes, a concept that can be broadly applied to other human malignancies.",

Mechanisms include {beta}-cell KATP channel dysfunction (e.g., KCNJ11 (MODY13) or ABCC8 (MODY12) mutations); however, no other {beta}-cell channelopathies have been identified in MODY.\n\nMethodsA four-generation family with autosomal dominant non-obese, non-ketotic antibody-negative diabetes, without mutations in known MODY genes, underwent exome sequencing. Whole-cell and single-channel K+ currents, Ca2+ handling, and GSIS were determined in cells expressing either mutated or wild-type (WT) protein.\n\nResultsWe identified a novel non-synonymous genetic mutation in KCNK16 (NM_001135105: c.341T>C, p.Leu114Pro) segregating with MODY. KCNK16 is the most abundant and {beta}-cell-restricted K+ channel transcript and encodes the two-pore-domain K+ channel TALK-1. Whole-cell K+ currents in transfected HEK293 cells demonstrated drastic (312-fold increase) gain-of-function with TALK-1 Leu144Pro vs. WT, due to greater single channel activity. Glucose-stimulated cytosolic Ca2+ influx was inhibited in mouse islets expressing TALK-1 Leu114Pro (area under the curve [AUC] at 20mM glucose: Leu114Pro 60.1 vs. WT 89.1; P=0.030) and less endoplasmic reticulum calcium storage (cyclopiazonic acid-induced release AUC: Leu114Pro 17.5 vs. WT 46.8; P=0.008). TALK-1 Leu114Pro significantly blunted GSIS compared to TALK-1 WT in both mouse (52% decrease, P=0.039) and human (38% decrease, P=0.019) islets.\n\nConclusionsOur data identify a novel MODY-associated gene, KCNK16; with a gain-of-function mutation limiting Ca2+ influx and GSIS. A gain-of-function common polymorphism in KCNK16 is associated with type 2 diabetes (T2DM); thus, our findings have therapeutic implications not only for KCNK16-associated MODY but also for T2DM.",

Development of a vector mediated therapy for USH2A-associated disease has been challenging due to its large size of coding sequence (~15.6kb). Therefore, there is an unmet need to develop alternative therapeutic strategies. The USH2A protein (Usherin) contains many repetitive domains, and it has been hypothesized that some domains may be dispensable with regard to protein function. Here, we show that skipping of exon 13 of the human USH2A gene or the equivalent exon 12 of the mouse Ush2a gene results in an in-frame transcript that produces functional Usherin protein. This nearly full length Usherin rescues the ciliogenesis in Ush2a null cells as well as the cochlear and retinal phenotypes in Ush2a null mice. Together, our results support the development of exon-skipping strategies to treat both visual and hearing loss in patients with USH2A-associated disease due to mutations in exon 13.",

The mammalian SC is formed of eight structural components, including SYCE1, the only central element protein with known causative mutations in human infertility. We combine mouse genetics, cellular and biochemical studies to reveal that SYCE1 undergoes multivalent interactions with SC component SIX6OS1. The N-terminus of SIX6OS1 binds and disrupts SYCE1s core dimeric structure to form a 1:1 complex, whilst their downstream sequences provide a distinct second interface. These interfaces are separately disrupted by SYCE1 mutations associated with non-obstructive azoospermia and premature ovarian failure, respectively. Mice harbouring SYCE1s POF mutation and a targeted deletion within SIX6OS1s N-terminus are infertile with failure of chromosome synapsis. We conclude that both SYCE1-SIX6OS1 binding interfaces are essential for SC assembly, thus explaining how SYCE1s reported clinical mutations give rise to human infertility.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput methods, such as ribosome profiling, have revealed the complexity of translation regulation in Bacteria and Eukarya with large-scale effects on cellular functions. In contrast, the translational landscape in Archaea remains mostly unexplored. Here, we developed ribosome profiling in a model archaeon, Haloferax volcanii, elucidating, for the first time, the translational landscape of a representative of the third domain of life. We determined the ribosome footprint of H. volcanii to be comparable in size to that of the Eukarya. We linked footprint lengths to initiating and elongating states of the ribosome on leadered transcripts, operons, and on leaderless transcripts, the latter representing 70% of H. volcanii transcriptome. We manipulated ribosome activity with translation inhibitors to reveal ribosome pausing at specific codons. Lastly, we found that the drug harringtonine arrested ribosomes at initiation sites in this archaeon. This drug treatment allowed us to confirm known translation initiation sites and also reveal putative novel initiation sites in intergenic regions and within genes. Ribosome profiling revealed an uncharacterized complexity of translation in this archaeon with bacteria-like, eukarya-like, and potentially novel translation mechanisms. These mechanisms are likely to be functionally essential and to contribute to an expanded proteome with regulatory roles in gene expression.",

    "abstract": "The capsaicin receptor, TRPV1, is a key ion channel involved in inflammatory pain signaling. Although mainly studied in sensory nerves, there are reports of TRPV1 expression in isolated segments of the vasculature, but whether the channel localizes to vascular endothelium or smooth muscle is controversial and the distribution and functional roles of TRPV1 in arteries remain unknown. We mapped functional TRPV1 expression throughout the mouse arterial circulation. Analysis of reporter mouse lines TRPV1PLAP-nlacZ and TRPV1-Cre:tdTomato combined with Ca2+ imaging revealed specific localization of TRPV1 to smooth muscle of terminal arterioles in the heart, fat and skeletal muscle. Capsaicin evoked inward currents and raised intracellular Ca2+ levels in arterial smooth muscle cells, constricted arterioles ex vivo and in vivo and increased systemic blood pressure in mice and rats. Further, capsaicin markedly and dose-dependently reduced coronary flow. Pharmacologic and/or genetic disruption of TRPV1 abolished all these effects of capsaicin as well as vasoconstriction triggered by lysophosphatidic acid, a bioactive lipid generated by platelets and atherogenic plaques. Notably, ablation of sensory nerves did not affect the responses to capsaicin revealing a vascular smooth muscle-restricted signaling mechanism. Moreover, unlike in sensory nerves, TRPV1 function in arteries was resistant to activity-induced desensitization. Thus, TRPV1 activation in vascular myocytes of resistance arterioles enables a persistent depolarizing current, leading to constriction of coronary, skeletal muscle, and adipose arterioles and a sustained increase in systemic blood pressure.",
