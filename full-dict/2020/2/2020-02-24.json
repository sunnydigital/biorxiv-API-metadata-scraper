    "abstract": "Applying whole exome sequencing (WES) to populations with unique genetic architecture has the potential to reveal novel genes and variants associated with traits and diseases. We sequenced and analyzed the exomes of 6,716 individuals from an American Indian population in Southwest US (Southwestern American Indian, or SWAI) with well-characterized metabolic traits. We found that individuals of SWAI have distinct allelic architecture compared to individuals with European and East Asian ancestry, with many predicted loss-of-function (pLOF) and nonsynonymous variants that were highly enriched or private in SWAI. We evaluated gene-level associations with metabolic traits using pLOF and nonsynonymous variants in SWAI. Many of the candidate genes from previous GWAS studies for body mass index, type 2 diabetes, and plasma lipid levels were associated with respective traits in SWAI. Notably, these associations were mainly driven by pLOF and nonsynonymous variants that are unique or highly enriched in American Indians, many of which have not been observed in other populations or functionally characterized. Our study illustrates the utility and potential of WES in American Indians to prioritize candidate effector genes within GWAS loci and to find novel variants in known diseases genes with potential clinical impact.",

    "abstract": "In the course of experiments aimed at deciphering the inhibition mechanism of mycophenolic acid and ribavirin in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, we observed an inhibitory effect of the nucleoside guanosine (Gua). Here, we report that Gua and not the other standard nucleosides inhibits HCV replication in human hepatoma cells. Gua did not directly inhibit the in vitro polymerase activity of NS5B, but it modified the intracellular levels of nucleoside di- and tri-phosphate (NDPs and NTPs), leading to deficient HCV RNA replication and reduction of infectious progeny virus production. Changes in the concentrations of NTP or NDP modified NS5B RNA polymerase activity in vitro, in particular de novo RNA synthesis and template switching. Furthermore, the Gua-mediated changes were associated with a significant increase in the number of indels in viral RNA, which may account for the reduction of the specific infectivity of the viral progeny, suggesting the presence of defective genomes. Thus, a proper NTP:NDP balance appears to be critical to ensure HCV polymerase fidelity and minimal production of defective genomes.\n\nAuthor summaryRibonucleoside metabolism is essential for replication of RNA viruses. In this article we describe the antiviral activity of the natural ribonucleoside guanosine (Gua). We demonstrate that hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication is inhibited in the presence of increasing concentrations of this ribonucleoside and that this inhibition does not occur as a consequence of a direct inhibition of HCV polymerase. Cells exposed to increasing concentrations of Gua show imbalances in the intracellular concentrations of nucleoside-diphosphates and triphosphates and as the virus is passaged in these cells, it accumulates mutations that reduce its infectivity and decimate its normal spreading capacity.",

    "abstract": "To date, gene therapies for human application rely on engineered promoters that cannot be finely controlled. Here, we report a universal switch element that allows precise control for gene silencing or gene replacement after exposure to a small molecule. Importantly, these small molecule inducers are in human use, are orally bioavailable when given to animals or humans, and can reach both peripheral tissues and the brain. Moreover, the switch system (Xon) does not require the co-expression of any regulatory proteins. Using Xon, translation of desired elements for gene knockdown or gene replacement occurs after a single oral dose, and expression levels can be controlled by drug dose or in waves with repeat drug intake. This universal switch can provide temporal control of gene editing machinery and gene addition cassettes that can be adapted to cell biology applications and animal studies. Additionally, due to the oral bioavailability and safety of the drugs employed, the Xon switch provides an unprecedented opportunity to refine gene therapies for more appropriate human application.",

    "abstract": "Perturbed neuronal migration and abnormal axonogenesis have been shown to be implicated in the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the molecular mechanism remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that dendritic cell factor 1(DCF1) is involved in neuronal migration and axonogenesis. The deletion of dcf1 in mice delays the localization of callosal projection neurons, while dcf1 overexpression restores normal migration. Delayed neurons appear as axon swelling and axonal boutons loss, resulting in a permanent deficit in the callosal projections. Western blot analysis indicates that absence of dcf1 leads to the abnormal activation of ERK signal. Differential protein expression assay shows that PEBP1, a negative regulator of the ERK signal, is significant downregulation in dcf1 KO mice. Direct interaction between DCF1 and PEBP1 is confirmed by Co-immunoprecipitation test, thus indicating that DCF1 regulates the ERK signal in a PEBP1-dependent pattern. As a result of the neurodevelopmental migration disorder, dcf1 deletion results in ASD-like behaviors in mice. This finding identifies a link between abnormal activated ERK signaling, delayed neuronal migration and autistic-like behaviors in humans.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWGenes encoding the mRNA targets of Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) are enriched for genetic association with psychiatric disorders. However, many FMRP targets possess functions that are themselves genetically associated with psychiatric disorders, including synaptic transmission and plasticity, making it unclear whether the genetic risk is truly related to binding by FMRP or is alternatively mediated by the sampling of genes better characterised by another trait or functional annotation. Using published common variant, rare coding variant and copy number variant data, we examined the relationship between FMRP binding and genetic association with schizophrenia, major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. We then explored the partitioning of genetic association between overrepresented functional categories. High-confidence targets of FMRP were enriched for common schizophrenia risk alleles, as well as rare loss-of-function and de novo nonsynonymous variants in cases. Similarly, through common variation, FMRP targets were associated with major depressive disorder, and we present novel evidence of association with bipolar disorder. These relationships could not be explained by membership of other functional annotations known to be associated with psychiatric disorders, including those related to synaptic structure and function. This study reinforces the evidence that targeting by FMRP captures a subpopulation of genes enriched for genetic association with a range of psychiatric disorders, across traditional diagnostic boundaries.",

    "abstract": "Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is a translation-dependent RNA quality control mechanism that occurs in the cytoplasm. However, it is unknown how NMD regulates the stability of RNAs translated at the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). Here, we identify a localized NMD pathway dedicated to ER-translated mRNAs. We previously identified NBAS, a component of the Syntaxin 18 complex involved in Golgi-to-ER trafficking, as a novel NMD factor. Here, we show that NBAS fulfils an independent function in NMD. This ER-NMD pathway requires the interaction of NBAS with the core NMD factor UPF1, which is partially localized at the ER in the proximity of the translocon. NBAS and UPF1 co-regulate the stability of ER-associated transcripts, in particular those associated with the cellular stress response. We propose a model where NBAS recruits UPF1 to the membrane of the ER and activates an ER-dedicated NMD pathway, thus providing an ER protective function by ensuring quality control of ER-translated mRNAs.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=158 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/954453v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (43K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@172e4a3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9769org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d478c1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@143e0f9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HIGHLIGHTSO_LINBAS is an NMD factor that localizes to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)\nC_LIO_LINBAS has dual, independent, roles in Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport and in ER-NMD\nC_LIO_LINBAS recruits the core NMD factor UPF1 to the membrane of the ER\nC_LIO_LIThe ER-NMD pathway targets for degradation mRNAs that are translated at the ER\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Spo11, which makes DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) essential for meiotic recombination, is poorly understood mechanistically because it has been recalcitrant to biochemical study. Here, we provide a molecular analysis of S. cerevisiae Spo11 purified with partners Rec102, Rec104 and Ski8. Rec102 and Rec104 jointly resemble the B subunit of archaeal Topoisomerase VI, with Rec104 similar to a GHKL domain but without conserved ATPase motifs. Unexpectedly, the Spo11 complex is monomeric (1:1:1:1 stoichiometry), indicating that dimerization may control DSB formation. Reconstitution of DNA binding reveals topoisomerase-like preferences for duplex-duplex junctions and bent DNA. Spo11 also binds noncovalently but with high affinity to DNA ends mimicking cleavage products, suggesting a mechanism to cap DSB ends. Mutations that reduce DNA binding in vitro attenuate DSB formation, alter DSB processing, and reshape the DSB landscape in vivo. Our data reveal structural and functional similarities between the Spo11 core complex and Topo VI, but also highlight differences reflecting their distinct biological roles.",

    "abstract": "Background: -Synuclein (-syn) is the predominant protein in Lewy-body inclusions, which are pathological hallmarks of -synucleinopathies, such as Parkinsons disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Other hallmarks include activation of microglia, elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as the activation of T and B cells. These immune changes point towards a dysregulation of both the innate and the adaptive immune system. T cells have been shown to recognize epitopes derived from -syn and altered populations of T cells have been found in PD and MSA patients, providing evidence that these cells can be key to the pathogenesis of the disease. Objective: To study the role of the adaptive immune system with respect to -syn pathology. Methods: We injected human -syn preformed fibrils (PFFs) into the striatum of immunocompromised mice (NSG) and assessed accumulation of phosphorylated -syn pathology, proteinase K-resistant -syn pathology and microgliosis in the striatum, substantia nigra and frontal cortex. We also assessed the impact of adoptive transfer of naive T and B cells into PFF-injected immunocompromised mice. Results: Compared to wildtype mice, NSG mice had an 8-fold increase in phosphorylated -syn pathology in the substantia nigra. Reconstituting the T cell population decreased the accumulation of phosphorylated -syn pathology and resulted in persistent microgliosis in the striatum when compared to non-transplanted mice. Conclusion: Our work provides evidence that T cells play a role in the pathogenesis of experimental -synucleinopathy.",

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) can undergo massive expansion, but the regulatory mechanisms that govern ER membrane biogenesis are largely unclear. Here, we conduct a genetic screen for factors involved in ER membrane expansion in budding yeast and identify the ER transmembrane protein Ice2 as a strong hit. We show that Ice2 promotes ER membrane biogenesis by opposing the phosphatidic acid phosphatase Pah1, which is called lipin in metazoa. Ice2 inhibits the conserved Nem1-Spo7 complex, which dephosphorylates and thus activates Pah1. Furthermore, Ice2 cooperates with the transcriptional regulation of lipid synthesis genes and helps to maintain ER homeostasis during ER stress. These findings establish inhibition of the lipin phosphatase complex as an important mechanism for controlling ER membrane biogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Polar marine ecosystems hold the potential for bioactive compound biodiscovery, based on their untapped macro- and microorganismal diversity. Characterization of polar benthic marine invertebrate-associated microbiomes is limited to few studies. This study was motivated by our interest in better understanding the microbiome structure and composition of the ascidian, Synoicum adareanum, in which the bioactive macrolide that has specific activity to melanoma, palmerolide A (PalA), was found. PalA bears structural resemblance to a combined nonribosomal peptide polyketide, that has similarities to microbially-produced macrolides. We conducted a spatial survey to assess both PalA levels and microbiome composition in S. adareanum in a region of the Antarctic Peninsula near Anvers Island (64{degrees} 46'S, 64{degrees} 03'W). PalA was ubiquitous and abundant across a collection of 21 ascidians (3 subsamples each) sampled from seven sites across the Anvers Island archipelago. The microbiome composition (V3-V4 16S rRNA gene sequence variants) of these 63 samples revealed a core suite of 21 bacteria, 20 of which were distinct from regional bacterioplankton. Co-occurrence analysis yielded several potentially interacting subsystems and, although the levels of PalA detected were not found to correlate with specific sequence variants, the core members appeared to occur in a preferred optimum and tolerance range of PalA levels. Taking these results together with an analysis of biosynthetic potential of related microbiome taxa indicates a core microbiome with substantial promise for natural product biosynthesis that likely interact with the host and with each other.",

HIV-1 evades innate immune sensing through encapsidated DNA synthesis and encodes accessory genes that antagonize specific antiviral effectors. Here we show that both particle associated, and expressed HIV-1 Vpr, antagonize the stimulatory effect of a variety of pathogen associated molecular patterns by inhibiting IRF3 and NF-\u03baB nuclear transport. Phosphorylation of IRF3 at S396, but not S386, was also inhibited. We propose that, rather than promoting HIV-1 nuclear import, Vpr interacts with karyopherins to disturb their import of IRF3 and NF-\u03baB to promote replication in macrophages. Concordantly, we demonstrate Vpr dependent rescue of HIV-1 replication in human macrophages from inhibition by cGAMP, the product of activated cGAS. We propose a model that unifies Vpr manipulation of nuclear import and inhibition of innate immune activation to promote HIV-1 replication and transmission.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The objective of the study was to examine the association between diffusion MRI techniques [diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neurite orientation/dispersion density imaging (NODDI)] and brain-injury blood biomarker levels [Tau, neurofilament-light (NfL), glial-fibrillary-acidic-protein (GFAP)] in high-school football and cross-country runners at their baseline, aiming to detect cumulative neuronal damage from prior seasons. Twenty-five football players and 8 cross-country runners underwent MRI and blood biomarker measures during preseason data collection. The whole-brain, tract-based spatial statistics was conducted for six diffusion metrics: fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial/radial diffusivity (AD, RD), neurite density index (NDI), and orientation dispersion index (ODI). Diffusion metrics and blood biomarker levels were compared between groups and associated within each group. The football group showed lower AD and MD than the cross-country group in various axonal tracts of the right hemisphere. Elevated ODI was observed in the football group in the right hemisphere of the corticospinal tract. Blood biomarker levels were consistent between groups except for elevated Tau levels in the cross-country group. Tau level was positively associated with MD and negatively associated with NDI in the corpus callosum of football players, but not in cross-country runners. Our data suggest that football players may develop axonal microstructural abnormality. Levels of MD and NDI in the corpus callosum were associated with serum Tau levels, highlighting the vulnerability of the corpus callosum against cumulative head impacts. Despite observing multimodal associations in some brain areas, neuroimaging and blood biomarkers may not strongly correlate to reflect the severity of brain damage.",

A fundamental challenge for progress is the range of possible target species and the disparate timescales involved, since the aggregating proteins are simultaneously the reactants, products, intermediates and catalysts of the reaction. It is a complex problem, therefore, to choose the states of the aggregating proteins that should be bound by the compounds to achieve the most potent inhibition. We present here a comprehensive kinetic theory of protein aggregation inhibition which reveals the fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic signatures characterising effective inhibitors by identifying quantitative relationships between the aggregation and binding rate constants. These results provide general physical laws to guide the design and optimisation of protein aggregation inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Alignment and orientation of cells in vivo plays a crucial role in the functionality of tissue. A challenged faced by traditional cell culture approaches is that the majority of two-dimensional substrates fail to induce a controlled alignment of cells in vitro. To address this challenge, approaches utilizing mechanical stresses, exposure to electrical fields, structurally aligned biomaterials and/or textured microfabricated substrates, have been developed to control the organization of cells through microenvironmental stimuli. In the field of muscle tissue engineering it is often desirable to control the alignment and fusion of muscle precursor cells as it more closely resembles in vivo conditions. In this study, we utilize plant-derived cellulose biomaterials to control the in vitro alignment of C2C12 murine myoblasts. We hereby report that cells display a clear sensitivity to the highly aligned vascular bundle architectures found in decellularized celery (Apium graveolens). Conveniently, the xylem and phloem channels lie within the 10-100m diameter, which has been shown to be optimal diameter for myoblast alignment through contact guidance. Following 10 days in proliferation media, F-actin filaments were observed to be aligned parallel to the longitudinal axis of the vascular bundle. Subsequently, following 5 days in differentiation media, myoblast maintained an aligned morphology, which led to the formation of aligned myotubes. We therefore conclude that the microtopography of the vascular bundle guides muscle cell alignment. The results presented here highlight the potential of this plant-derived scaffold for in vitro studies of muscle myogenesis, where structural anisotropy is required to more closely resemble in vivo conditions.",

However, attempts to elicit similar oligomannose-specific bnAbs by immunizing with oligomannosidic glycoconjugates have only been modestly successful so far. A common assumption is that eliciting oligomannose-specific bnAbs is hindered by B cell tolerance, resulting from the presented oligomannosides being sensed as self molecules. Here, we present data, along with existing scientific evidence, supporting an additional, or perhaps alternate, explanation: serum mannosidase trimming of the presented oligomannosides in vivo. Mannosidase trimming lessens the likelihood of eliciting antibodies with capacity to bind full-sized oligomannose, which typifies the binding mode of existing bnAbs to the oligomannose patch. The rapidity of the observed trimming suggests the need for immunization strategies and/or synthetic glycosides that readily avoid or resist mannosidase trimming upon immunization and can overcome possible tolerance restrictions.",

    "abstract": "One of the seminal findings of cognitive neuroscience is that the power of alpha-band ([~]10 Hz) brain waves, in occipital regions, increases when people close their eyes. This has encouraged the view that alpha oscillations are a default dynamic, to which the visual brain returns in the absence of input. Accordingly, we might be unable to increase the power of alpha oscillations when the eyes are closed, above the level that would usually ensue. Here we report counter evidence. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to record brain activity when people had their eyes open and closed, before and after they had adapted to radial motion. The increase in the power of alpha oscillations when people closed their eyes was enhanced by adaptation to a broad range of radial motion speeds. This effect was greatest for 10Hz motion, but robust for other frequencies, and specifically for 7.5Hz. This last observation is important, as it rules against an ongoing entrainment of activity, at the adaptation frequency, as an explanation for our results. Instead, our data show that visual processes remain active when people close their eyes, and these can be modulated by adaptation to increase the power of alpha oscillations in occipital brain regions.",

This spontaneously generated activity drives the refinement of synaptic connections, preparing young networks for patterned sensory input. Synaptic fine-tuning relies not only on the presence of spontaneous activity, but also on the specific characteristics of these activity patterns, such as their frequency, amplitude and synchronicity. Here, we provide evidence that these crucial characteristics are shaped by the relative balance of excitation and inhibition, where patterns with distinct characteristics have different excitatory/inhibitory ratios. Inhibition can control whether cells participate during a spontaneous event, as pharmacogenetic suppression of the somatostatin (SST) expressing subtype of inhibitory interneurons increased cell recruitment and lateral spread of events.",

    "abstract": "Studying the temporal dynamics of perceptual decisions offers key insights into the cognitive processes contributing to it. Conducting such investigation in a genetically tractable animal model can facilitate the subsequent unpacking of the mechanistic basis of different stages in perceptual dynamics. Here, we investigated the time course as well as fundamental psychophysical constants governing visual perceptual decision-making in freely behaving mice. We did so by analyzing response accuracy against reaction time (i.e., conditional accuracy), in a series of 2-AFC orientation discrimination tasks in which we varied target size, luminance, duration, and presence of a foil. Our results quantified two distinct stages in the time course of mouse visual decision-making - a  sensory encoding stage, in which conditional accuracy exhibits a classic tradeoff with response speed, and a subsequent  short term memory-dependent stage in which conditional accuracy exhibits a classic asymptotic decay following stimulus offset. We estimated the duration of visual sensory encoding as 200-320 ms across tasks, the lower bound of the duration of short-term memory as ~1700 ms, and the briefest duration of visual stimulus input that is informative as [&le;]50 ms. Separately, by varying stimulus onset delay, we demonstrated that the conditional accuracy function and RT distribution can be independently modulated, and found that the duration for which mice naturally withhold from responding is a quantitative metric of impulsivity. Taken together, our results establish a quantitative foundation for investigating the neural circuit bases of visual decision dynamics in mice.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThis study presents a quantitative breakdown of the time course of visual decision-making in mice during naturalistic behavior. It demonstrates parallel stages in mouse visual perceptual decision dynamics to those in humans, estimates their durations, and shows that mice are able to discriminate well under challenging visual conditions - with stimuli that are brief, low luminance, and small. These results set the stage for investigating the neural bases of visual perceptual decision dynamics and their dysfunction in mice.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the processes underlying normal, impaired and recovered language performance has been a long-standing goal for cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Many verbally-described hypotheses about language lateralisation and recovery have been generated. However, they have not been considered within a single, unified and implemented computational framework, and the literatures on healthy participants and patients are largely separated. These investigations also span different types of data, including behavioural results and fMRI brain activations, which augment the challenge for any unified theory. Consequently, many key issues, apparent contradictions and puzzles remain to be solved. We developed a neurocomputational, bilateral pathway model of spoken language production, designed to provide a unified framework to simulate different types of data from healthy participants and aphasic patients. The model encapsulates key computational principles (differential computational capacity, emergent division of labour across pathways, experience-dependent plasticity-related recovery) and provides an explanation for the bilateral yet asymmetric lateralisation of language in healthy participants, chronic aphasia after left rather than right hemisphere lesions, and the basis of partial recovery in patients. The model provides a formal basis for understanding the relationship between behavioural performance and brain activation. The unified model is consistent with the degeneracy and variable neuro-displacement theories of language recovery, and adds computational insights to these hypotheses regarding the neural machinery underlying language processing and plasticity-related recovery following damage.\n\nSignificance StatementStudies of healthy and impaired language have generated many verbally-described hypotheses. Whilst these verbal descriptions have advanced our understanding of language processing, some explanations are mutually incompatible and it is unclear how they work mechanistically. We constructed a neurocomputational bilateral model of spoken language production to simulate a range of phenomena in healthy participants and patients with aphasia simultaneously, including language lateralisation, impaired performance after left but not right damage, and hemispheric involvement in plasticity-dependent recovery. The model demonstrates how seemly contradictory findings can be simulated within a single framework. To our knowledge, this provides the first coherent mechanistic account of language lateralisation and recovery from post-stroke aphasia.",

    "abstract": "Six heavy metals (Hg, Cu, Cd, Cr, Pb, Zn) and 1 metalloid (As) in surface soils of Hong Kong were investigated in 10 land use categories (urban park, greening area, country park, rural area, restored landfill, agricultural farmland, orchard farm, crematorium, industrial and near highway area). Edaphic Hg concentration in Hong Kong was firstly reported here. Clustering of land uses was observed based on total pollutants concentrations (sum of 7 metals). The most polluted cluster consisted of industrial and highway areas (median: 617 to 833 mg kg-1) and the runner-up cluster included urban park, greening area and restored landfill (median: 400 to 500 mg kg-1). However, this general finding was not observed for Hg, where higher concentration was found in agricultural farmland (median 109 g kg-1). The use of low quality fertilizers, together with the contribution from exhausts and wearable parts from automobiles were believed to be the major sources of Cr, Cu and Zn in Hong Kong, while the application of Hg-containing agrochemicals maybe the main mechanism of Hg contamination in agricultural soil. Based on the daily intake assumption of 0.2 g d-1 of soil particles by USEPA, direct ingestion of Hg-containing soils is not a major exposure pathway for population in Hong Kong. When comparing the edaphic heavy metal concentrations with Dutch soil quality guidelines demonstrated that Hg, Cd and Pb were not in level of health concerns, while Cu, Cr and Zn in less than 6% of total samples were found to exceed the Dutch intervention values sporadically. In contrast, suburban soils from northern and northeastern Hong Kong were mostly contaminated with As (10% of total samples) at concentration that could be potentially causing adverse health impacts to the nearby population.\n\nPollutant in Hong Kong soils seriesO_LIChung, M.

Premature babies have been reported to possess a lower number of nephrons, but the mechanisms by which blood pressure is elevated in full-term LBW infants remain unclear. We generated a fetal low-carbohydrate and calorie-restricted model rat, and some individuals showed postnatal growth failure caused by increased miR-322 expression in the liver and decreased growth hormone receptor expression. Using this model, we examined how a high-fat diet-induced mismatch between prenatal and postnatal environments could elevate blood pressure after growth. Although LBW rats fed standard chow had slightly higher blood pressure than control rats, their blood pressure was significantly higher than controls when exposed to a high-fat diet. Observation of glomeruli subjected to PAM staining showed no difference in number or size. Aortic and cardiac angiotensin II receptor expression was altered with compensatory responses. Blood aldosterone levels were not different between control and LBW rats, but blood corticosterone levels were significantly higher in the latter with high-fat diet exposure. Administration of metyrapone, a steroid synthesis inhibitor, reduced blood pressure to levels comparable to controls. We showed that high-fat diet exposure causes impairment of the pituitary glucocorticoid feedback via miR-449a. These results clarify that LBW rats have increased blood pressure due to high glucocorticoid levels when they are exposed to a high-fat diet. These findings suggest a new therapeutic target for hypertension of LBW individuals.",

    "abstract": "RationaleThe cardiac sodium channel NaV1.5, encoded by SCN5A, produces the rapidly inactivating depolarizing current INa that is responsible for the initiation and propagation of the cardiac action potential. Acquired and inherited dysfunction of NaV1.5 results in either decreased peak INa or increased residual late INa (INa,L), leading to tachy/bradyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Previous studies have shown that increased cellular NAD+ and NAD+/NADH ratio increase INa through suppression of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and PKC-mediated NaV1.5 phosphorylation. In addition, NAD+-dependent deacetylation of NaV1.5 at K1479 by Sirtuin 1 increases NaV1.5 membrane trafficking and INa. The role of NAD+ precursors in modulating INa remains unknown.\n\nObjectiveTo determine whether and by which mechanisms the NAD+ precursors nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinamide (NAM) affect peak INa and INa,L in vitro and cardiac electrophysiology in vivo.\n\nMethods and ResultsThe effects of NAD+ precursors on the NAD+ metabolome and electrophysiology were studied using HEK293 cells expressing wild-type and mutant NaV1.5, rat neonatal cardiomyocytes (RNCMs), and mice. NR increased INa in HEK293 cells expressing NaV1.5 (500 M: 51 {+/-} 18%, p=0.02, 5 mM: 59 {+/-} 22%, p=0.03) and RNCMs (500 {micro}M: 60 {+/-} 26%, p=0.02, 5 mM: 75 {+/-} 39%, p=0.03) while reducing INa,L at the higher concentration (RNCMs, 5 mM: -45 {+/-} 11%, p=0.04). NR (5 mM) decreased NaV1.5 K1479 acetylation but increased INa in HEK293 cells expressing a mutant form of NaV1.5 with disruption of the acetylation site (NaV1.5-K1479A). Disruption of the PKC phosphorylation site abolished the effect of NR on INa. Furthermore, NAM (5 mM) had no effect on INa in RNCMs or in HEK293 cells expressing wild-type NaV1.5, but increased INa in HEK293 cells expressing NaV1.5-K1479A. Dietary supplementation with NR for 10-12 weeks decreased QTc in C57BL/6J mice (0.35% NR: -4.9 {+/-} 2.0%, p=0.26; 1.0% NR: -9.5 {+/-} 2.8%, p=0.01).\n\nConclusionsNAD+ precursors differentially regulate NaV1.5 via multiple mechanisms. NR increases INa, decreases INa,L, and warrants further investigation as a potential therapy for arrhythmic disorders caused by NaV1.5 deficiency and/or dysfunction.",

Our data show how the DSB machinery self-assembles on chromosome axes to create centers of DSB activity. We propose that multilayered control of Spo11 arises from recruitment of regulatory components and modulation of biophysical properties of the condensates.",

    "abstract": "In human, execution of unimanual movements requires lateralized activation of the primary motor cortex, which then transmits the motor command to the contralateral hand through the crossed corticospinal tract (CST). Mutations in NETRIN-1 alter motor control lateralization, leading to congenital mirror movements. To address the role of midline Netrin-1 on CST development and subsequent motor control, we analyzed the morphological and functional consequences of floor-plate Netrin-1 depletion in conditional knock-out mice (Shh::cre;Ntn1lox/lox mice).\n\nHere, we show that depletion of floor plate Netrin-1 critically disrupts midline crossing of the CST, whereas the other commissural systems are mostly preserved. The CST defect results in abnormal but functional ipsilateral projections, and is associated with abnormal symmetric movements. Therefore, our study reveals a new role for Netrin-1 in CST development. It also describes a unique mouse model recapitulating characteristics of human congenital mirror movements, through abnormal CST decussation.",

    "abstract": "Neural activity is often low dimensional and dominated by only a few prominent neural covariation patterns. It has been hypothesised that these covariation patterns could form the building blocks used for fast and flexible motor control. Supporting this idea, recent experiments have shown that monkeys can learn to adapt their neural activity in motor cortex on a timescale of minutes, given that the change lies within the original low-dimensional subspace, also called neural manifold. However, the neural mechanism underlying this within-manifold adaptation remains unknown. Here, we show in a computational model that modification of recurrent weights, driven by a learned feedback signal, can account for the observed behavioural difference between within- and outside-manifold learning. Our findings give a new perspective, showing that recurrent weight changes do not necessarily lead to change in the neural manifold. On the contrary, successful learning is naturally constrained to a common subspace.",

    "abstract": "Humans use prior knowledge to efficiently solve novel tasks, but how they structure past knowledge to enable such fast generalization is not well understood. We recently proposed that hierarchical state abstraction enabled generalization of simple one-step rules, by inferring context clusters for each rule. However, humans daily tasks are often temporally extended, and necessitate more complex multi-step, hierarchically structured strategies. The options framework in hierarchical reinforcement learning provides a theoretical framework for representing such transferable strategies. Options are abstract multi-step policies, assembled from simpler one-step actions or other options, that can represent meaningful reusable strategies as temporal abstractions. We developed a novel sequential decision making protocol to test if humans learn and transfer multi-step options. In a series of four experiments, we found transfer effects at multiple hierarchical levels of abstraction that could not be explained by flat reinforcement learning models or hierarchical models lacking temporal abstraction. We extended the options framework to develop a quantitative model that blends temporal and state abstractions. Our model captures the transfer effects observed in human participants. Our results provide evidence that humans create and compose hierarchical options, and use them to explore in novel contexts, consequently transferring past knowledge and speeding up learning.",

The intracranial electroencephalogram allows us to measure these changes, thus, it is a critical tool for its study. Recently, we showed that the electrocortical temporal complexity decreased from wakefulness to sleep. Nevertheless, the origin of this complex activity remains a controversial topic due to the existence of possible artifacts contaminating the brain signals. In this work, we showed that complexity decreases during sleep, independently of the electrode configuration employed. This fact strongly suggests that the basis for the behavioral-state differences in complexity does not have an extracranial origin; i.e., generated from the brain.",

    "abstract": "Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were investigated in 138 soil samples collected in Hong Kong. Results showed that within the selected OCPs, only DDT and its metabolites (DDD and DDE) were frequently detected. Of 138 soil samples, 18% were non-detected for any DDT residues, while 25% were contaminated sporadically with DDT only (non-detected to 1090 {micro}g kg-1) and 57% contained various combinations of DDT, DDD and DDE (2.03 to 1118 {micro}g kg-1). In contrast, total PCBs ({sum}66 congeners) contamination was distributed more evenly (0.22 to 154 {micro}g kg-1) than DDTs, but serious contamination was found in industrial areas and soils collected near highways. Concentrations of 7 indicator PCBs ranged between non-detected to 34.5 {micro}g kg-1. The ratios of DDT/metabolites were typically greater than 1, thus suggesting recent application of DDT. Medium-range deposition from industrial areas within as well as away from the city is also suspected to be the origins of DDTs and PCBs found in Hong Kong soils. The concentrations of DDTs and PCBs in all soil samples did not exceed the recommended values in soil quality guidelines except 3 samples for DDT from locations far away from densely populated districts such as Tuen Mun and Tin Shui Wai. Therefore, DDTs and PCBs were not of significant concern in terms of their impacts on public health and environment.",

    "abstract": "Many white-faced capuchin monkey dyads in Lomas Barbudal, Costa Rica, practice idiosyncratic interaction sequences that are not part of the species-typical behavioural repertoire. These interactions often include uncomfortable or risky elements. These interactions exhibit the following characteristics commonly featured in definitions of rituals in humans: (1) they involve an unusual intensity of focus on the partner, (2) the behaviours have no immediate utilitarian purpose, (3) they sometimes involve \"sacred objects\", (4) the distribution of these behaviours suggests that they are invented and spread via social learning, and (5) many behaviours in these rituals are repurposed from other behavioural domains (e.g. extractive foraging). However, in contrast to some definitions of ritual, capuchin rituals are not overly rigid in their form, nor do the sequences have specific opening and closing actions. In our 9,260 hours of observation, ritual performance rate was uncorrelated with amount of time dyads spent in proximity but is (modestly) associated with higher relationship quality and rate of coalition formation across dyads. Our results suggest that capuchin rituals serve a bond-testing rather than a bond-strengthening function. Ritual interactions are exclusively dyadic, and between-dyad consistency in form is low, casting doubt on the alternative hypothesis that they enhance group-wide solidarity.",

A small N-terminal loop is bound at the intracellular vestibule of the transport path, arresting the transporter in an auto-inhibition state. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of KCCs is structure-solved for the first time, revealing two conserved phosphorylation harboring segments (PHSs), which exhibit different conformation between P-mimic and DP-mimic mutants, explaining the inhibitory effect of phosphorylation. DIOA is located in between the two transmembrane domains, tightly bound to the loop between TM10 and TM11, locking the transporter in inward-facing conformation. Together, our study makes important steps in understanding the sophisticated regulation mechanisms of KCCs, with prospect for the specific drug development.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in experimental biology allow creation of datasets where several genome-wide data types (called omics) are measured per sample. Integrative analysis of multi-omic datasets in general, and clustering of samples in such datasets specifically, can improve our understanding of biological processes and discover different disease subtypes. In this work we present Monet (Multi Omic clustering by Non-Exhaustive Types), which presents a unique approach to multi-omic clustering. Monet discovers modules of similar samples, such that each module is allowed to have a clustering structure for only a subset of the omics. This approach differs from most extant multi-omic clustering algorithms, which assume a common structure across all omics, and from several recent algorithms that model distinct cluster structures using Bayesian statistics. We tested Monet extensively on simulated data, on an image dataset, and on ten multi-omic cancer datasets from TCGA. Our analysis shows that Monet compares favorably with other multi-omic clustering methods. We demonstrate Monets biological and clinical relevance by analyzing its results for Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma. We also show that Monet is robust to missing data, can cluster genes in multi-omic dataset, and reveal modules of cell types in single-cell multi-omic data. Our work shows that Monet is a valuable tool that can provide complementary results to those provided by extant algorithms for multi-omic analysis.",

    "abstract": "Saccharomyces yeast can grow through mitotic vegetative cell division while they convert resources in their environment into biomass. When cells encounter specific low nutrient environments, sporulation may be initiated and meiotic division produces 4 haploid cells contained inside a protective ascus. The protected spore state does not acquire new resources but is partially protected from desiccation, heat, and caustic chemicals. Because cells cannot both be protected and acquire resources simultaneously, committing to sporulation represents a trade-off between current and future reproduction. Recent work has suggested that one of the major environmental factors that select for the formation of spores is passaging through insect guts, as this also represents a major way that yeasts are vectored to new food sources. We subjected replicate populations of a panel of 5 yeast strains to repeated, predictable passaging through insects by feeding them to fruit flies (Drosopila melanogaster) and then allowing surviving yeast cell growth in defined media for a fixed period of time. We also evolved control populations using the same predictable growth environments but without being exposed to flies. We assayed populations for their sporulation rate, as measured by the percentage of cells that had sporulated after resource depletion. We found that the strains varied in their ancestral sporulation rate such that domesticated strains had lower sporulation. During evolution, all strains evolved increased sporulation in response to passaging through flies, but domesticated strains evolved to lower final levels of sporulation. We also found that exposure to flies led to an evolved change in the timing of the sporulation response relative to controls, with a more rapid shift to sporulation, and that wild-derived strains showed a more extreme response. We conclude that strains that have lost the ability to access genetic variation for total sporulation rate and the ability to respond to cues in the environment that favor sporulation due to genetic canalization during domestication.",

Breakdown of the balance between Tregs and Tconvs is a hallmark of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Due to the positive dependency of both populations on Interleukin-2 (IL-2), it is subtle leverage to restore the healthy immune balance. By employing a mechanistic mathematical model, we studied the IL-2 therapy in order to increase and stabilize Treg population and restrict inflammatory Tconv response. We introduced an adaptive control strategy to design the minimal IL-2 dosage. This adaptive strategy allows for an individualized therapy based on the feedback of immune kinetics of the patient. Our in silico results suggest that a minimal Treg population is required to restrict the transient side-effect of IL-2 injections on the effector Tconv response. The combination of IL-2 and adoptive Treg transfer therapies is able to limit this side effect in our simulations. Implications of our in silico results are discussed in the context of autoimmunity and transplantation.",

This work, for the first time, shows a well established, yet simple, cost- and time-efficient protocol for the study of GCase enzyme in human leukocytes by the artificial substrate PNPG. Characterization of the enzyme in human leukocytes for activation parameters (optimal pH, Km, and Vmax) and enzyme inhibition, was done. The results indicate that the optimum pH of GCase enzyme with PNPG is 5.1. The Km and Vmax values were 12.6mM and 333 U/mg, respectively. Gluconolactone successfully inhibits GCase in a competitive manner, with a Ki value of 0.023 mM and IC 50 of 0.047 mM. Glucose inhibition was uncompetitive with a Ki of 1.94 mM and IC50 of 55.3 mM.

Understanding sources of variation in this process is central to understanding the biodemography of natural populations.

Consistent with findings in humans, the resulting \"epigenetic clock\" closely tracks chronological age, but individuals are predicted to be somewhat older or younger than their known ages. Surprisingly, these deviations are not explained by the strongest predictors of lifespan in this population, early adversity and social integration. Instead, they are best predicted by male dominance rank: high-ranking males are predicted to be older than their true ages, and epigenetic age tracks changes in rank over time. Our results argue that achieving high rank for male baboons--the best predictor of reproductive success--imposes costs consistent with a \"live fast, die young\" life history strategy.",

    "abstract": "Field-based sampling of terrestrial habitats at continental scales is required to build ecosystem observation networks. However, a key challenge for detecting change in ecosystem composition, structure and function is to obtain a representative sample of habitats. Representative sampling contributes to ecological validity when analysing large spatial surveys, but field resources are limited and representativeness may differ markedly from purely practical sampling strategies to statistically rigorous ones. Here, we report a post hoc assessment of the coverage of environmental gradients as a surrogate for ecological coverage by a continental-scale survey of the Australian Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN). TERNs surveillance program maintains a network of ecosystem observation plots that were init ially established in the rangelands through a stratification method (clustering of bioregions by environment) and Ausplots methodology. Subsequent site selection comprised gap filling combined with opportunistic sampling. Firstly, we confirmed that environmental coverage has been a good surrogate for ecological coverage. The cumulative sampling of environments and plant species composition over time were strongly correlated (based on mean multivariate dispersion; r = 0.93). We then compared the environmental sampling of Ausplots to 100,000 background points and a set of retrospective (virtual) sampling schemes: systematic grid, simple random, stratified random, and generalised random-tessellation stratified (GRTS). Differences were assessed according to sampling densities along environmental gradients, and multivariate dispersion (environmental space represented via multi-dimensional scaling). Ausplots outperformed systematic grid, simple random and GRTS in coverage of environmental space (Tukey HSD of mean dispersion, p < .001). GRTS site selection obtained similar coverage to Ausplots when employing the same bioregional stratification. Stratification by climatic zones generated the highest environmental coverage (p < .001), but the resulting sampling densities over-represented mesic coastal habitats. The Ausplots stratification by bioregions implemented under practical constraints represented complex environments well compared to statistically oriented or spatially even samples. However, potential statistical inference and power also depend on spatial and temporal replication, unbiased site selection, and accurate field measurements relative to the magnitude of change. A key conclusion is that environmental, rather than spatial, stratification is required to maximise ecological coverage across continental ecosystem observation networks.",

    "abstract": "Rearrangements of germline variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) coding gene segments generate a diverse T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. Two different molecular mechanisms govern a stochastic nature of gene choices by the recombination activating gene (RAG) protein complex. One is diffusion access in which a chromatin loop containing a coding gene bounces back and forth until the loop encounters a distant gene. The other is a linear chromatin scan, which extrudes chromatin loops to assemble a gene pair in a distance-dependent manner. However, the extent to which those two mechanisms underlie V(D)J recombination in human TCRs still remains unclear. Applying statistical modelling to TCR sequence data, we infer the stochastic process of gene choices during this recombination. The inferred usage of V and J gene segments vary from gene to gene. This pattern of gene usage is consistent across individuals, suggesting a fundamental bias in the gene choice. Our modelling shows the dependency of VJ pairing on their linear distance in the TCR- locus; proximal-proximal and distal-distal VJ pairs are more preferred than proximal-distal or distal-proximal gene pairs. These results support bi-directional RAG scanning into proximal and distal sides of the TCR- V gene locus.",

    "abstract": "Functional mechanisms remain unknown for most genetic loci associated to complex human traits and diseases. In this study, we first mapped trans-eQTLs in a data set of primary monocytes stimulated with LPS, and discovered that a risk variant for autoimmune disease, rs17622517 in an intron of C5ORF56, affects the expression of the transcription factor IRF1 20 kb away. The cis-regulatory effect on IRF1 is active under early immune stimulus, with a large number of trans-eQTL effects across the genome under late LPS response. Using CRISPRi silencing, we showed that the SNP locus indeed functions as an IRF1 enhancer with widespread transcriptional effects. Genome editing by CRISPR further indicated that rs17622517 is indeed a causal variant in this locus, and recapitulated the LPS-specific trans-eQTL signal. Our results suggest that this common genetic variant affects inter-individual response to immune stimuli via regulation of IRF1. For this autoimmune GWAS locus, our work provides evidence of the causal variant, demonstrates a condition-specific enhancer effect, identifies IRF1 as the likely causal gene in cis, and indicates that overactivation of the downstream immune-related pathway may be the cellular mechanism increasing disease risk. This work not only provides rare experimental validation of a master-regulatory trans-eQTL, but also demonstrates the power of eQTL mapping to build mechanistic hypotheses amenable for experimental follow-up using the CRISPR toolkit.",

    "abstract": "Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) of the peripheral nervous system has been largely used in the field of neurorehabilitation to decrease muscle atrophy and to restore motor function in paralyzed patients. The rehabilitative effects of NMES rely on the direct or indirect efferent effect on muscle tone and afferent volleys that induce cortical excitation. Although different neuroimaging tools suggested the capability of NMES to regulate the excitability of sensorimotor cortex and corticospinal circuits, to date how intensity and dose of NMES can neuromodulate the brain oscillatory activity measured with electroencephalography (EEG) is yet to be clarified. In the present study, we quantify the effect of NMES parameters on brain oscillatory activity of twelve healthy participants who underwent stimulation of wrist extensors during rest while EEG was recorded. Three different NMES intensities were included: (1) low, inducing slight sensory perception, (2) medium, inducing moderate sensory perception, and (3) high, generating a functional movement. Firstly, we efficiently removed stimulation artifacts from the sensorimotor brain oscillatory activity. Secondly, we analyzed the effect of amplitude and dose on the latter. On the one hand, we observed significant NMES amplitude-dependent brain SMR modulation, demonstrating the direct effect of afferent receptors recruitment. On the other hand, our results revealed a significant NMES amplitude-based dose-effect on SMR modulation over time. While at low and medium intensities the NMES produced a significant cortical inhibitory effect in time, at high intensity a significant cortical facilitatory effect was induced. These results highlight the functionally relevant role of muscle contraction and proprioception in sensorimotor processes, which should be carefully considered for the design and development of NMES based neuromodulation.",

    "abstract": "Two important theories in cognitive neuroscience are predictive coding and the global workspace theory. A key research task is to understand how these two theories relate to one another, and particularly, how the brain transitions from a predictive early state to the eventual engagement of a brain-scale state (the global workspace). To address this question, we present a source-localisation of EEG responses evoked by the local-global task - an experimental paradigm that engages a predictive hierarchy, which encompasses the global workspace. The results of our source reconstruction suggest three-phases of processing. The first phase involves the sensory (here auditory) regions of the superior temporal lobe and predicts sensory regularities over a short timeframe (as per the local effect). The third phase is brain-scale, involving inferior frontal, as well as inferior and superior parietal regions; consistent with a global neuronal workspace (as per the global effect). Crucially, our analysis suggests that there is an intermediate (second) phase, involving modulatory interactions between inferior frontal and superior temporal regions. Furthermore, sedation with propofol reduces modulatory interactions in the second phase. This selective effect is consistent with a predictive coding explanation of sedation, with propofol acting on descending predictions of the precision of prediction errors; thereby constraining access to the global neuronal workspace.",

    "abstract": "In the era of structural genomics, with a large number of protein structures becoming available, identification of domains is an important problem in protein function analysis as it forms the first step in protein classification. Domain identification has been an active area of research for over four decades and a wide range of automated methods have been proposed. In the proposed network-based machine learning approach, NML-DIP, a combination of supervised (SVM) and unsupervised (k-means) machine learning techniques are used for domain identification in proteins. The algorithm proceeds by first representing protein structure as a protein contact network and using topological properties, viz., length, density, and interaction strength (that assesses inter- and intra-domain interactions) as feature vectors in the first SVM to distinguish between single and multi-domain proteins. A second SVM is used to identify the number of domains in multi-domain proteins. Thus, it does not require a prior information of the number of domains. The k-means algorithm is then used to identify the domain boundaries that are assessed using CATH annotation. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on four benchmark datasets and compared with four state-of-the-art domain identification methods. The performance of the approach is comparable to other domain identification tools and works well even when the domains are formed with non-contiguous segments. The performance of the program is significantly improved for prior information about the number of domains. The algorithm is available at: https://bit.ly/NML-DIP.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial genes are often organized in functionally related transcriptional units or operons. One such example is the fimAICDFGH operon, which codes for type I fimbriae in Escherichia coli. We tested the hypothesis that markerless polar mutations could be efficiently engineered using CRISPR/Cas12a in the fim operon. Cas12a-mediated engineering of a terminator sequence inside the fimA gene occurred with efficiencies between 10 and 30%, whilst other types of mutations, such as a 97 bp deletion, occurred with 100% efficiency. Our results showed that some of the obtained mutants, including one with a single base substitution at the fim locus, had decreased mRNA levels of fimA, suggesting that the regulation of the fim operon was disrupted. We corroborated the polar effect of these mutants by phenotypic assays and quantitative PCR, showing up to a 43 fold decrease in expression of genes downstream fimA. We believe this strategy could be useful in engineering the transcriptional shut-down of multiple genes in one single step. For bio-production in E. coli, this opens the possibility of inhibiting competing metabolic routes.",

    "abstract": "Achieving high titer rates and yields (TRY) remains a bottleneck in the production of heterologous products through microbial systems, requiring elaborate engineering and many iterations. Reliable scaling of engineered strains is also rarely addressed in the first designs of the engineered strains. Both high TRY and scale are challenging metrics to achieve due to the inherent trade-off between cellular use of carbon towards growth vs. target metabolite production. We hypothesized that being able to strongly couple product formation with growth may lead to improvements across both metrics. In this study, we use elementary mode analysis to predict metabolic reactions that could be targeted to couple the production of indigoidine, a sustainable pigment, with the growth of the chosen host, Pseudomonas putida KT2440. We then filtered the set of 16 predicted reactions using -omics data. We implemented a total of 14 gene knockdowns using a CRISPRi method optimized for P. putida and show that the resulting engineered P. putida strain could achieve high TRY. The engineered pairing of product formation with carbon use also shifted production from stationary to exponential phase and the high TRY phenotype was maintained across scale. In one design cycle, we constructed an engineered P. putida strain that demonstrates close to 50% maximum theoretical yield (0.33 g indigoidine/g glucose consumed), reaching 25.6 g/L indigoidine and a rate of 0.22g/l/h in exponential phase. These desirable phenotypes were maintained from batch to fed-batch cultivation mode, and from 100ml shake flasks to 250 mL ambr(R) and 2 L bioreactors.",

DN adipocytes displayed higher browning features according to ProFAT or BATLAS scores and characteristic DEG patterns revealing associated pathways which were highly expressed (thermogenesis, interferon, cytokine, retinoic acid, with UCP1 and BMP4 as prominent network stabilizers) or downregulated (particularly extracellular matrix remodelling) compared to SC ones. Part of DEGs in either DN or SC browning was PPAR{gamma}-dependent. Presence of the FTO obesity-risk allele suppressed the expression of mitochondrial and thermogenesis genes with a striking resemblance between affected pathways and those appearing in ProFAT and BATLAS, underlining the importance of metabolic and mitochondrial pathways in thermogenesis.

    "abstract": "Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins SOCS1 and SOCS3 are considered tumor suppressors in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC). To gain insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms, the expression of SOCS1/ SOCS3 was evaluated in The Cancer Genome Atlas LIHC dataset along with key oncogenic signaling pathway genes. SOCS1 expression was not significantly reduced in HCC yet higher expression predicted favorable prognosis, whereas SOCS3 lacked predictive potential despite lower expression. Only a small proportion of the cell cycle, receptor tyrosine kinase, growth factor and RAS-RAF-MEK-MAPK signaling genes negatively correlated with SOCS1 or SOCS3, of which even fewer showed elevated expression in HCC and predicted survival. However, many PI3K-AKT-MTOR pathway genes showed mutual exclusivity with SOCS1/SOCS3 and displayed independent predictive ability. Among genes that negatively correlated with SOCS1/SOCS3, CDK2, MLST8, AURKA, MAP3K4 and RPTOR showed corresponding modulations in the livers of mice lacking Socs1 or Socs3 during liver regeneration and in experimental HCC, and in Hepa1-6 murine HCC cells overexpressing SOCS1/SOCS3. However, Cox proportional hazards model identified CXCL8, DAB2 and PIK3R1 as highly predictive in combination with SOCS1 or SOCS3. These data suggest that developing prognostic biomarkers and precision treatment strategies based on SOCS1/SOCS3 expression need careful testing in different patient cohorts.",

    "abstract": "Achieving precision oncology requires accurate identification of targetable cancer vulnerabilities in patients. Generally, genomic features are regarded as the state-of-the-art method for stratifying patients for targeted therapies. In this work, we conduct the first rigorous comparison of DNA- and expression-based predictive models for viability across five datasets encompassing chemical and genetic perturbations. We find that expression consistently outperforms DNA for predicting vulnerabilities, including many currently stratified by canonical DNA markers. Contrary to their perception in the literature, the most accurate expression-based models depend on few features and are amenable to biological interpretation. This work points to the importance of exploring more comprehensive expression profiling in clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Synapses are actively dismantled to mediate circuit refinement, but the developmental pathways that regulate synaptic disassembly are largely unknown. We have previously shown that the epithelial sodium channel UNC-8 triggers an activity-dependent mechanism that drives the removal of presynaptic proteins liprin-/SYD-2, Synaptobrevin/SNB-1, RAB-3 and Endophilin/UNC-57 in remodeling GABAergic neurons in C. elegans (Miller-Fleming et al., 2016). Here, we report that the transcription factor Iroquois/IRX-1 regulates UNC-8 expression as well as an additional pathway, independent of UNC-8, that functions in parallel to dismantle functional presynaptic terminals. We show that the additional IRX-1-regulated pathway is selectively required for the removal of the presynaptic proteins, Munc13/UNC-13 and ELKS, which normally mediate synaptic vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release. Our findings are notable because they highlight the key role of transcriptional regulation in synapse elimination and reveal parallel-acting pathways that orchestrate synaptic disassembly by removing specific active zone proteins.",

To understand striatal dynamics and basal ganglia functions, it is essential to clarify the circuitry that supports this behavioural-based segregation. Here, we show that the mouse DS is made of two non-overlapping functional circuits divided by a sharp boundary. Combining in vivo optopatch-clamp and extracellular recordings of spontaneous activity, we demonstrate different coupling of lateral and medial striatum to the cortex together with an independent integration of the slow and fast oscillations, due to particular cortico-striatal connectivity and local properties of each region. Additionally, distinct properties between striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons were revealed along DS. These results demonstrate that the rodent DS is segregated in two neuronal circuits, in homology with the caudate and putamen nuclei of primates.",

This ability is central to navigating social interactions in which different contexts often require different mappings between private states and public actions in order to minimise conflict and facilitate communication. Here we investigated how the human brain supports private-public mappings, using an interactive task which required subjects to adapt how they communicated their confidence about a perceptual decision to the social context. Univariate and multivariate analysis of fMRI data revealed that a private-public distinction is reflected in a medial-lateral division of prefrontal cortex - with lateral frontal pole (FPl) supporting the context-dependent mapping from a private sense of confidence to a public report. The concept of private-public mappings provides a promising framework for understanding flexible social behaviour.",

Translocation of the growth cone necessitates mechanochemical regulation of cell - extracellular matrix interactions and the generation of propulsive traction forces onto the growth environment. However, the molecular mechanisms subserving force generation by growth cones remain poorly characterized. The formin family member, Fmn2, has been identified earlier as a regulator of growth cone motility. Here, we explore the mechanisms underlying Fmn2 function in the growth cone. Evaluation of multiple components of the adhesion complexes suggests that Fmn2 regulates point contact stability. Analysis of F-actin retrograde flow reveals that Fmn2 functions as a clutch molecule and mediates the coupling of the actin cytoskeleton to the growth substrate, via point contact adhesion complexes. Using traction force microscopy, we show that the Fmn2-mediated clutch function is necessary for the generation of traction stresses by neurons. Our findings suggest that Fmn2, a protein associated with neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, is a key regulator of a molecular clutch activity and consequently motility of neuronal growth cones.",

    "abstract": "Many avian hosts of brood parasitic birds discriminate between different types of threats and may respond with categorically different, specifically anti-predatory or anti-parasitic behaviors. Alternatively, hosts may adjust their responses to threat level in a graded manner, responding more aggressively to brood parasites during the laying and incubation stages of nesting, when nests are most susceptible to parasitism, and more aggressively to nest predators during the nestling and fledgling stages when predation would be more costly than parasitism. In New Zealand, endemic host Whiteheads act inconspicuously around their nests in the presence of sympatric Long-tailed Cuckoos, their obligate brood parasite, perhaps to avoid disclosing nest location. We tested behavioral responses of a Whitehead population on Tiritiri Matangi Island that has been breeding allopatrically from cuckoos for 17 years. We presented models of the allopatric parasite, a sympatric predator (Morepork Owl), and a sympatric non-threatening heterospecific (Song Thrush) during the egg and chick stages, and to groups of cooperatively breeding Whiteheads. We compared responses across nest stage and stimulus type. We found that, unlike sympatric Whiteheads elsewhere in New Zealand, Whiteheads on Tiritiri Matangi produced alarm calls in response to the cuckoo model. Furthermore, the rate of alarm calling was similar towards the cuckoo and the owl and across egg and chick stage and higher than to the control stimulus. These results are consistent with allopatric Whiteheads having lost their specific anti-parasitic defense tactics in response to brood parasitic cuckoos.",

Pentavalent antimonials (e.g. sodium stibogluconate; SSG) are first line drugs for CL, despite protracted and painful treatment regimens. Data from animal models indicate that the effectiveness of SSG requires drug-immune synergy, but mechanistic insight from patients is lacking. We studied whole blood and lesion transcriptomes from CL patients in Sri Lanka at presentation and during SSG treatment. In lesions, we identified differential expression of immune-related genes, including immune checkpoint molecules, after the onset of treatment whereas no differentially expressed genes were identified in whole blood. We confirmed reduced lesional PD-L1 and IDO1 protein expression on treatment in a second validation cohort, using digital spatial profiling and quantitative immunohistochemistry. Dual IHC-FISH revealed significantly higher expression of these immune checkpoint molecules on parasite-infected compared to non-infected lesional CD68+ monocytes / macrophages. Crucially, early reduction in PD-L1 but not IDO1 expression was predictive of rate of clinical cure and occurred in parallel with a reduction in parasite load. A multivariate cox proportional hazard model showed that patients with lower PD-L1 expression on treatment were more likely to cure earlier (HR= 4.88). Our data support a model whereby the initial anti-leishmanial activity of antimonial drugs alleviates checkpoint inhibition of T cell immunity, facilitating immune-drug synergism and clinical cure. Our findings demonstrate that PD-L1 expression can be used as an early predictor of clinical response to SSG treatment and support the use of PD-L1 inhibition as adjunct host directed therapy in Sri Lankan CL.",

    "abstract": "Poor sleep is a hazard of daily life that oftentimes cannot be avoided. Gender differences in daily sleep and wake patterns are widely reported; however, it remains unclear how biological sex, which is comprised of genetic and endocrine components, directly influences sleep regulatory processes. In the majority of model systems studied thus far, sex differences in daily sleep amount are predominant during the active (wake) phase of the sleep-wake cycle. The pervasiveness of sex differences in sleep amount throughout phylogeny suggests a strong underlying genetic component. The goal of the current study is to determine if sex differences in active-phase sleep amount are dependent on sex chromosomes in mice.\n\nSleep was examined in the four-core genotype (FCG) mouse model, whose sex chromosome complement (XY, XX) is independent of sex phenotype (male or female). In this line, sex phenotype is determined by the presence or absence of the Sry gene, which is dissociated from the Y chromosome. Polysomnographic sleep recordings were obtained from gonadectomized (GDX) FCG mice to examine spontaneous sleep states and the ability to recover from sleep loss. We report that during the active-phase, the presence of the Sry gene accounts for most sex differences during spontaneous sleep; however, during recovery from sleep loss, sex differences in sleep amount are partially driven by sex chromosome complement. These results suggest that genetic factors on the sex chromosomes encode the homeostatic response to sleep loss.",

    "abstract": "The myocardium is metabolically flexible and can use fatty acids, glucose, lactate/pyruvate, ketones, or amino acids to fuel mechanical work. However, impaired metabolic flexibility is associated with cardiac dysfunction in conditions including diabetes and heart failure. The mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) is required for pyruvate metabolism and is composed of a hetero-oligomer of two proteins known as MPC1 and MPC2. Interestingly, MPC1 and MPC2 expression is downregulated in failing human hearts and in a mouse model of heart failure. Mice with cardiac-specific deletion of MPC2 (CS-MPC2-/-) exhibited loss of both MPC2 and MPC1 proteins and reduced pyruvate-stimulated mitochondrial respiration. CS-MPC2-/- mice exhibited normal cardiac size and function at 6-weeks old, but progressively developed cardiac dilation and contractile dysfunction thereafter. Feeding CS-MPC2-/- mice a ketogenic diet (KD) completely prevented or reversed the cardiac remodeling and dysfunction. Other diets with higher fat content and enough carbohydrate to limit ketosis also improved heart failure in CS-MPC2-/- mice, but direct ketone body provisioning provided only minor improvements in cardiac remodeling. Finally, KD was also able to prevent further remodeling in an ischemic, pressure-overload mouse model of heart failure. In conclusion, loss of mitochondrial pyruvate utilization leads to dilated cardiomyopathy that can be corrected by a ketogenic diet.",

    "abstract": "Post-transcriptional regulation via small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) has been implicated in diverse regulatory processes in bacteria, including virulence. One class of sRNAs, termed trans-acting sRNAs, can affect the stability and/or the translational efficiency of regulated transcripts. In this study, we utilized a collaborative approach that employed data from infection with the Borrelia burgdorferi Tn library, coupled with Tn-seq, together with borrelial sRNA and total RNA transcriptomes, to identify an intergenic trans-acting sRNA, which we designate here as ittA for infectivity-associated and tissue-tropic sRNA locus A. The genetic inactivation of ittA resulted in a significant attenuation in infectivity, with decreased spirochetal load in ear, heart, skin and joint tissues. In addition, the ittA mutant did not disseminate to peripheral skin sites or heart tissue, suggesting a role for ittA in regulating a tissue-tropic response. RNA-Seq analysis determined that 19 transcripts were differentially expressed in the ittA mutant relative to its genetic parent, including vraA, bba66, ospD and oms28 (bba74). Subsequent proteomic analyses also showed a significant decrease of OspD and Oms28 (BBA74) proteins. To our knowledge this is the first documented intergenic sRNA that alters the infectivity potential of B. burgdorferi.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYLyme disease is a tick-borne infection mediated by the spirochetal bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, that is responsible for greater than 300,000 infections in the United States per year. As such, additional knowledge regarding how this pathogen modulates its regulatory armamentarium is needed to understand how B. burgdorferi establishes and maintains infection. The identification and characterization of small, non-coding RNA molecules in living systems, designated as sRNAs, has recalibrated how we view post-transcriptional regulation. Recently, over 1,000 sRNAs were identified in B. burgdorferi. Despite the identification of these sRNAs, we do not understand how they affect infectivity or B. burgdorferi pathogenesis related outcomes. Here, we characterize the ittA B. burgdorferi sRNA and show that it is essential for optimal infection using murine experimental infection as our readout. We also track the effect of this sRNA on the transcriptional and proteomic profile as the first step in providing mechanistic insight into how this important sRNA mediates its regulatory effect.",

    "abstract": "A new porcine coronavirus SADS-CoV was recently identified from suckling piglets with severe diarrhea in southern China and its genome sequence is most identical (~95% identity) to that of bat -coronavirus HKU2. It again indicates bats are the natural reservoir of many coronaviruses that have great potential for cross-species transmission to animals and humans by recombination and/or mutation. Here we report the cryo-EM structures of HKU2 and SADS-CoV spike glycoprotein trimers at 2.38 [A] and 2.83 [A] resolution, respectively. HKU2 and SADS-CoV spikes exhibit very high structural similarity, with subtle differences mainly distributed in the NTD and CTD of the S1 subunit responsible for cell attachment and receptor binding. We systematically analyzed and compared the NTD, CTD, SD1 and SD2 domains of the S1 subunit and the S2 subunit of HKU2 spike with those of -, {beta}-, {gamma}-, and {delta}-coronavirus spikes. The results show that the NTD and CTD of HKU2/SADS-CoV are probably the most ancestral in the evolution of spike. Although the S2 subunit mediating membrane fusion is highly conserved, the connecting region after fusion peptide in HKU2/SADS-CoV S2 subunit also adopts a conformation distinct from other coronaviruses. These results structurally demonstrate a close evolutionary relationship between HKU2 /SADS-CoV and {beta}-coronavirus spikes and provide new insights into the evolution and cross-species transmission of coronaviruses.",

    "abstract": "Many models of evolution are stochastic processes, where some quantity of interest fluctuates randomly in time. One classic example is the Moran birth-death process, where that quantity is the number of mutants in a population. In such processes we are often interested in their absorption (i.e. fixation) probabilities, and the conditional distributions of absorption time. Those conditional time distributions can be very difficult to calculate, even for relatively simple processes like the Moran birth-death model. Instead of considering the time to absorption, we consider a closely-related quantity: the number of mutant population size changes before absorption. We use Walds martingale to obtain the conditional characteristic functions of that quantity in the Moran process. Our expressions are novel, analytical, and exact. The parameter dependence of the characteristic functions is explicit, so it is easy to explore their properties in parameter space. We also use them to approximate the conditional characteristic functions of absorption time. We state the conditions under which that approximation is particularly accurate. Martingales are an elegant framework to solve principal problems of evolutionary stochastic processes. They do not require us to evaluate recursion relations, so we can quickly and tractably obtain absorption probabilities and times of evolutionary stochastic processes.\n\nAuthor summaryThe Moran process is a probabilistic birth-death model of evolution. A mutant is introduced to an indigenous population, and we randomly choose organisms to live or die on subsequent time steps. Our goals are to calculate the probabilities that the mutant eventually dominates the population or goes extinct, and the distribution of time it requires to do so. The conditional distributions of time are difficult to obtain for the Moran process, so we consider a slightly different but related problem. We instead calculate the conditional distributions of the number of times that the mutant population size changes before it dominates the population or goes extinct. We use a martingale identified by Abraham Wald to obtain elegant and exact expressions for those distributions. We then use them to approximate conditional time distributions, and we show when that approximation is accurate. Our analysis outlines the basic concepts martingales and demonstrates why they are a formidable tool for studying probabilistic evolutionary models such as the Moran process.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveGlut-1 is a key regulator in the process of glucose uptake. Previous studies have shown that Glut-1 affects autophagy. However, it is unclear whether there is a correlation between Glut-1 and autophagy in the progression of laryngeal carcinoma. This study was performed to investigate the role of Glut-1 in the development of laryngeal carcinoma.\n\nMethodsA stable HEp-2 cell model was constructed by Glut-1 and Beclin-1 shRNA lentiviral infection. The autophagosome was measured by transmission electron microscopy. Protein levels of LC3, ATG5, CyclinD1, Bcl-2, Caspase-3, and c-Myc were determined by Western blotting. CCK8 assay and Transwell assays were used to determine cell viability and migration rate of HEp-2 cells, respectively. Flow cytometry was performed to analyze the rate of apoptosis. Immunofluorescence was performed to determine the expression distribution of LC3.\n\nResultsGlut-1 knockdown significantly promoted autophagosome formation by upregulating the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I as well as the role of rapamycin (RAP) and Beclin-1 overexpression on autophagy flux in HEp-2 cells. Glut-1 inhibition also reduced the viability of HEp-2 cells followed by the decreases in expression of cyclinD1 and c-Myc. In addition, Glut-1 depletion increased the number of apoptotic HEp-2 cells accompanied by activation of caspase-3 and downregulation of Bcl-2. Glut-1 knockdown also reduced the migration rate of HEp-2 cells by promoting the expression of N-cadherin and inhibiting the expression of E-cadherin. Beclin-1 consumption significantly reversed Gult-1 knockdown-mediated autophagy activation, resulting in promotion of both proliferation and migration and inhibition of apoptosis.\n\nConclusionsGlut-1 knockdown-induced autophagy inhibits the proliferation and migration of HEp-2 cells, and promotes apoptosis of HEp-2 cells partly by regulating autophagy.",

The present study focused on ecological stoichiometric characteristics of different macrophyte plants soil, leave, stem and root after the removal of seine fishing since 2000 from Shengjin Lake. For C, N and P analysis from leaves, stems, roots and soil to explore their stoichiometric ratio and deriving environmental forces here four dominant plant communities (Zizania caduciflora, Vallisineria natans, Trapa quadrispinosa and Carex schmidtii) were collected. C, N, P and C: N: P ratio in leafs, stems, roots and soil among the plant communities vary and the studied plant communities had significant effect on the measured variables. There was high C: N in C.schmidtii soil (7.08{+/-}1.504) but not vary significantly (P >0.05), and N: P ratio measured high in V. natans (13.7{+/-}4.05) and C: P in T.quadrispinosa soil (81.14{+/-}43.88) and showed significant variation (P<0.05) respectively. High leaf C: N and N: P ratio was measured in C. schmidtii and V. natans respectively. Nevertheless, high leaf C: P ratio was measured in Z.caduciflora. From the three studied organs leafs C: N, N: P ratio showed high values compared to root and stems. The correlation analysis result showed that, at 0-10cm depth ranges SOC correlated negatively with stem total phosphorus (STP), and RTN (P<0.05) but positively strongly with LTP and LTN (P<0.01) respectively. Soil total nitrogen at 0-10cm strongly positively correlated with LTP (P<0.01) and positively with RN: P and LTC (P<0.05). Soil basic properties such as SMC.BD and pH positively correlated with soil ecological stoichiometric characteristics.

This requires species, which show high genetic homology to humans such as non-human primates. Efficacy assessment of novel human-specific biologicals in eosinophilic airway inflammation is currently performed in the cost-intensive macaque asthma model.\n\nObjectiveThe present study investigated whether marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus), a small-bodied non-human primate species from the New World, develop eosinophilic airway inflammation in response to house dust mite allergen exposure (HDM, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus).\n\nMethodsMarmoset monkeys were sensitized against HDM by subcutaneous (s.c.) injection and subsequent intratracheal (i.t.) HDM aerosol challenges. Airway and systemic immunologic reactions were monitored and sensitivity towards glucocorticoid therapy was assessed. The pulmonary immunologic response was analyzed by repetitive bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).\n\nResultsBronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) exhibited increased levels of eosinophils, mast cells, and lymphocytes, as well as interleukin (IL)-13 after HDM challenges, compared to negative controls. The systemic immunologic response was assessed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from sensitized animals, which secreted increased IL-13 and IFN-{gamma} upon allergen stimulation in contrast to non-sensitized negative control animals. Although IgE was not detectable, HDM-specific serum IgG was elevated in sensitized animals. Both airway and systemic responses were reduced by treatment with glucocorticoids. However, lung function and pathological analyses did not reveal significant differences between groups.\n\nConclusionIn conclusion, marmoset monkeys developed a mild HDM-induced eosinophilic airway inflammation useful for efficacy testing of novel human-specific biologicals.",

    "abstract": "Proteus mirabilis is the third most common etiological factor of the urinary tract infection (UTI). It produces urease, which contributes to the formation of crystalline biofilm, considered to be one of the most important virulence factors of P. mirabilis strains, along with their ability to swarm on a solid surface. The aim of this study was to analyze the pathogenic properties of two selected groups of clinical P. mirabilis isolates, antimicrobial-susceptible and multidrug-resistant (MDR), collected from hospitals in different regions in Poland. The strains were examined based on virulence gene profiles, urease and hemolysin production, biofilm formation, and swarming properties. Additionally, the strains were differentiated based on the Dienes test and antibiotic susceptibility patterns. It turned out that the MDR strains exhibited kinship more often than susceptible ones. The strains which were able to form stronger biofilm had broader antimicrobial resistance profiles. It was also found that the strongest swarming motility correlated with susceptibility to most antibiotics. The correlations described in this work encourage further investigation of the mechanisms of pathogenicity of P. mirabilis.\n\nAuthor summaryProteus mirabilis is widely widespread in environment but also it is responsible for most Proteus infections, especially in human urinary tracts. They cause complicated, persistent infections especially due to the ability to form urinary stones. The clinical importance of P. mirabilis have been described in the literature many times. However, the role of pathogenic features with correlation to drug resistance require further investigation. In this research we analyzed thee virulence factors in relation to drug resistance of clinical P. mirabilis strains isolated from urine. The virulence genes, ureolytic and hemolytic activity, biofilm formation, swarming growth and strains kindship were analyzed. The most important observation was that the strains exhibited a stronger territorialism were kindred to a lower number of other strains, formed weaker biofilm and exhibited a lower resistance to antibiotics. Furthermore, we proved that the strains which were more likely to mutual growth, they were also less similar in the drug resistance profile but exhibited a higher resistance to antibiotics, which can be beneficial for different bacteria living together. We believe that P. mirabilis with strong territorialism can represent a wild group of strains with poor experience of antibiotic pressure. The environmental influence (toxins, antibiotics, bacterial neighbors) stimulates the development of a less dispersed community with stronger biofilm, exchange of genes and increase of resistance to antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "The SERINC gene family comprises of five paralogs in humans of which SERINC3 and SERINC5 inhibit HIV-1 infectivity and are counteracted by Nef. The origin of this anti-retroviral activity, its prevalence among the remaining paralogs, and its ability to target retroviruses remain largely unknown. Here we show that despite their early divergence, the anti-retroviral activity is functionally conserved among four human SERINC paralogs with SERINC2 being an exception. The lack of activity in human SERINC2 is associated with its post-whole genome duplication (WGD) divergence, as evidenced by the ability of pre-WGD orthologs from yeast, fly, and a post-WGD-proximate SERINC2 from coelacanth to inhibit nef-defective HIV-1. Intriguingly, potent retroviral factors from HIV-1 and MLV are not able to relieve the SERINC2-mediated particle infectivity inhibition, indicating that such activity was directed towards other retroviruses that are found in coelacanth (like foamy viruses). However, foamy-derived vectors are intrinsically resistant to the action of SERINC2, and we show that a foamy virus envelope confers this resistance. Despite the presence of weak arms-race signatures, the functional reciprocal adaptation among SERINC2 and SERINC5 and, in response, the emergence of antagonizing ability in foamy virus appears to have resulted from a long-term conflict with the host.",

    "abstract": "The circadian clock is a complex system that plays many important roles in most organisms. Previously, many mathematical models have been used to sharpen our understanding of the Arabidopsis clock. However, these models are mostly dependent on transcriptional regulation, and the importance of post-translational regulation is still rarely discussed from theoretical aspects. In this study, we built a series of simplified oscillators with different regulations to study the importance of post-translational regulation (specifically, 26S proteasome degradation) in the clock system. We found that a simple transcriptional-based oscillator can already generate sustained oscillation, but the oscillation can be easily destroyed in the presence of transcriptional leakage. Coupling post-translational control with transcriptional-based oscillator in a feed-forward loop will greatly improve the robustness of the oscillator in the presence of basal leakage. Using these general models, we were able to replicate the increased variability observed in the E3 ligase mutant for both plant and mammalian clocks. With this insight, we also predict a plausible regulator of several E3 ligase genes in the plants clock. Thus, our results provide insights into and the plausible importance in coupling transcription and post-translation controls in the clock system.\n\nAuthor summaryFor circadian clocks, several current models had successfully captured the essential dynamic behavior of the clock system mainly with transcriptional regulation. Previous studies have shown that the 26s (1, 2) proteasome degradation controls are important in maintaining the stability of circadian rhythms. However, how the loss-of-function or over-expression mutant of this targeted degradations lead to unstable oscillation is still unclear. In this work, we investigate the importance of coupled transcriptional and post-translational feedback loop in the circadian oscillator. With general models our study indicate that the unstable behavior of degradation mutants could be caused by the increase in the basal level of the clock genes. We found that coupling a non-linear degradation control into this transcriptional based oscillator using feed-forward loop improves the robustness of the oscillator. Using this finding, we further predict some plausible regulators of Arabidopsiss E3 ligase protein such as COP1 and SINAT5. Hence, our results provide insights on the importance of coupling transcription and post-translation controls in the clock system.",

    "abstract": "BAP1 is a ubiquitin hydrolase whose deubiquitinase activity is mediated by polycomb group-like protein ASXL2. Cancer-related mutations/deletions of BAP1 lead to loss-of-function either by directly targeting the catalytic (UCH) or ULD domains of BAP1, the latter disrupts binding to ASXL2, an obligate partner for BAP1 enzymatic activity. However, the biochemical and biophysical properties of the domains involved in forming the enzymatically active complex are unknown. Here we investigate the molecular dynamics, kinetics and stoichiometry of these interactions. We demonstrate that the BAP1 and ASXL2 domain/proteins or protein complexes produced in either bacteria or baculovirus are structurally and functionally active. The interaction between BAP1 and ASXL2 is direct, specific, and stable to in vitro biochemical and biophysical manipulations as detected by isothermal titration calorimetry, GST association, and optical biosensor assays. Association of the ASXL2-AB box greatly stimulates BAP1 deubiquitinase activity. A stable ternary complex can be formed comprised of the BAP1-UCH, BAP1-ULD, and ASXL2-AB domains. Binding of the BAP1-ULD domain to the ASXL2-AB box is rapid, with fast association and slow dissociation rates. Stoichiometric analysis revealed that one molecule of the ULD domain directly interacts with one molecule of the AB Box. Real-time kinetics analysis of ULD/AB protein complex to the UCH domain of BAP1, based on SPR, indicated that formation of the ULD/AB complex with the UCH domain is a single-step event with fast association and slow dissociation rates. These structural and dynamic parameters implicate the possibility for future small-molecule approaches to reactivate latent wild-type UCH activity in BAP-mutant malignancies.",

    "abstract": "The Rad51/RecA family of recombinases perform a critical function in typical repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs): strand invasion of a resected DSB end into a homologous double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) template sequence to facilitate repair. However, repair of a DSB using single stranded DNA (ssDNA) as a template, a common method of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing, is Rad51-independent. We have analyzed the genetic requirements for these Rad51-independent events in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in two different assays. Gene editing events were carried out either by creating a DSB with the site-specific HO endonuclease and repairing the DSB with 80-nt single-stranded oligonucleotides (ssODNs) or by using a bacterial retron system that produces ssDNA templates in vivo in combination with DSBs created by Cas9. We show that single strand template repair (SSTR), is dependent on Rad52, Rad59, Srs2 and the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex, but not Rad51, Rad54 or Rad55. Srs2 acts to prevent overloading of Rad51 on the ssDNA filament, whereas Rad59 appears to alleviate the inhibition of Rad51 on Rad52s strand annealing activity; thus, deletion of RAD51 suppresses both the srs2{Delta} and rad59{Delta} phenotypes. This same suppression by rad51{Delta} of rad59{Delta} is found in another DSB repair pathway, single strand annealing (SSA). In contrast, gene targeting using an 80-bp dsDNA template of the same sequence is Rad51-dependent. We also examined SSTR events in which the ssODN carried several mismatches. In the absence of the mismatch repair protein, Msh2, we found that the fate of mismatches carried on the ssDNA template are very different at the 3 end, which can anneal directly to the resected DSB end, compared to the 5 end. We also find that DNA polymerase Pol{delta}s 3 to 5 proofreading activity frequently excises a mismatch close to the 3 end of the template, similar to its removal of heterologies close to the 3 invading end of the DSB. We further report that SSTR is accompanied by a 600-fold increase in mutations in a region adjacent to the sequences directly undergoing repair. These DNA polymerase {zeta}-dependent mutations may compromise the accuracy of gene editing.",
