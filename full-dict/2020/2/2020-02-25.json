    "abstract": "Disruptions in reward processing and anhedonia have long being considered as possible contributors to the aetiology and maintenance of Anorexia nervosa (AN). Recently, interoceptive deficits have also been observed in AN, including reduced tactile pleasure. However, the extent to which this tactile anhedonia is specifically liked to an impairment in a specialized, interoceptive C tactile system originating at the periphery, or a more top-down mechanism in the processing of pleasant tactile stimuli remains debated. Here, we investigated two related hypotheses. First, we examined whether the differences, between patients with AN and healthy controls in the perception of pleasantness of touch stimuli delivered in a CT-optimal manner versus a CT non-optimal manner would also be observed in patients recovered from AN. This is important as tactile anhedonia in acute patients may be the secondary result of prolonged malnutrition, rather than a deficit that contributed to the development of the disorder. Second, we examined whether these three groups would also differ in their top-down, anticipatory beliefs about the perceived pleasantness of different materials touching the skin, and to what degree such top-down beliefs and related impairments in alexithymia and interoceptive sensibility would explain any differences in perceived tactile plesantness. To this end, we measured the anticipated pleasantness of various materials touching the skin and the perceived pleasantness of light, dynamic stroking touches applied to the forearm of 27 women with AN, 24 women who have recovered and 30 healthy controls using C Tactile (CT) afferents-optimal (slow) and non-optimal (fast) velocities. Our results showed that both clinical groups anticipated tactile experiences and rated delivered tactile stimuli as less pleasant than healthy controls, but the latter difference was not related to the CT optimality of the stimulation. Instead, differences in how CT optimal touch were perceived were predicted by differences in top-down beliefs, alexithymia and interoceptive sensibility. Thus, this study concludes that tactile anhedonia in AN is not the secondary result of malnutrition but persists as a trait even after otherwise successful recovery of AN and also it not linked to a bottom-up interoceptive deficit in the CT system, but rather to a learned, defective top-down anticipation of pleasant tactile experiences.",

    "abstract": "What is selected when attention is directed to a specific location of the visual field? Theories of object-based attention have suggested that when spatial attention is directed to part of an object, attention does not simply enhance the attended location but automatically spreads to enhance all locations that comprise the object. Here, we tested this hypothesis by reconstructing the distribution of attention from population neuronal activity patterns in V1 using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and population-based receptive field mapping. We find that attention spreads from a spatially cued location to the underlying object - and enhances all spatial locations that comprise the object. Importantly, this spreading was also evident when the object was not task-relevant. These data suggest that attentional selection automatically operates at an object level, facilitating the reconstruction of coherent objects from fragmented representations in early visual cortex.",

    "abstract": "Motion-induced artifacts can significantly corrupt optical neuroimaging, as in most neuroimaging modalities. For high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT) with hundreds to thousands of source-detector pair measurements, motion detection methods are underdeveloped relative to both functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and standard functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). This limitation restricts the application of HD-DOT in many challenging situations and subject populations (e.g., bedside monitoring and children). Here, we evaluate a new motion detection method for multichannel optical imaging systems that leverages spatial patterns across channels. Specifically, we introduce a global variance of temporal derivatives (GVTD) metric as a motion detection index. We show that GVTD strongly correlates with external measures of motion and has high sensitivity and specificity to instructed motion - with area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.88, calculated based on five different types of instructed motion. Additionally, we show that applying GVTD-based motion censoring on both task and resting state HD-DOT data with natural head motion results in an improved spatial similarity to fMRI mapping for the same respective protocols (task or rest). We then compare the GVTD similarity scores with several commonly used motion correction methods described in the fNIRS literature, including correlation-based signal improvement (CBSI), temporal derivative distribution repair (TDDR), wavelet filtering, and targeted principal component analysis (tPCA). We find that GVTD motion censoring outperforms other methods and results in spatial maps more similar to matched fMRI data.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundProtection of organismal integrity involve physiological stress responses and behavioral defenses. Recent studies in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans have shown that pathogen and toxin exposure simultaneously stimulate cellular stress and detoxification responses and aversive behavior. However, whether a coordinate regulation exists between cellular and neurobehavioral defenses remains unclear.\n\nResultsHere we show that exposure of C. elegans to high concentrations of naturally attractive food-derived odors, benzaldehyde and diacetyl, induces toxicity and aversive behavior. Benzaldehyde preconditioning activates systemic cytoprotective stress responses involving DAF-16/FOXO, SKN-1/Nrf and Hsp90 in somatic cells, which confer behavioral tolerance to benzaldehyde and cross-tolerance to the structurally similar methyl-salicylate, but not to the structurally unrelated diacetyl. In contrast, diacetyl preconditioning augments diacetyl avoidance and does not induce apparent molecular defenses. Reinforcement of the experiences using massed training forms relevant associative memories. Memory retrieval by the odor olfactory cues leads to avoidance of food contaminated by diacetyl and context-dependent behavioral decision to avoid benzaldehyde only if there is an alternative, food-indicative odor.\n\nConclusionsOur findings reveal a regulatory link between physiological stress responses and learned behavior which facilitates self-protection in real and anticipated stresses. The potential conservation of this somato-neuronal connection might have relevance in maladaptive avoidant human behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Each olfactory cortical hemisphere receives ipsilateral odor information directly from the olfactory bulb and contralateral information indirectly from the other cortical hemisphere. Since neural projections to the olfactory cortex are disordered and non-topographic, spatial information cannot be used to align projections from the two sides like in the visual cortex. Therefore, how bilateral information is integrated in individual cortical neurons is unknown. We have found, in mice, that the odor responses of individual neurons to selective stimulation of each of the two nostrils are highly matched, such that odor identity decoding optimized with information arriving from one nostril transfers very well to the other side. Remarkably, these aligned responses are nevertheless asymmetric enough to allow decoding of stimulus laterality. Computational analysis shows that such matched odor tuning is incompatible with purely random connections but is explained readily by Hebbian plasticity structuring bilateral connectivity. Our data reveal that despite the distributed and fragmented sensory representation in the olfactory cortex, odor information across the two hemispheres is highly coordinated.",

Here, by single cell RNAseq analysis, we identified a population of germinal center (GC) B cells in the process of differentiating into MBCs. Using an inducible Crispr/Cas9 screening approach we identified the hematopoietically-expressed homeobox gene Hhex as a transcription factor regulating MBC differentiation. The co-repressor Tle3 was also identified in the screen and was found to interact with Hhex. Bcl6 directly repressed Hhex in GC B cells. Reciprocally, Hhex-deficient MBCs exhibited derepressed Bcl6 and reduced expression of Bcl6-repressed Bcl2. Overexpression of Bcl2 was able to rescue MBC differentiation in Hhex-deficient cells. We also identified Ski as an Hhex-induced transcription factor involved in MBC differentiation. These findings establish an important role for Hhex-Tle3 in regulating the transcriptional circuitry governing MBC differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are ancient innate immune components. Big defensins is a family of AMPs found in a restricted number of animal phyla, in particular mollusks where they have highly diversified. Big defensins are composed of a highly hydrophobic N-terminal region and a C-terminal {beta}-defensin-like region, stabilized by three disulfide bridges. They have been shown to be active against both Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. Antimicrobial aggregates called nanonets entrapping bacteria have been recently described as the mechanism of action of the Cg-BigDef1 from the oyster Crassostrea gigas. Specifically, the N-terminal domain of Cg-BigDef1 was identified as responsible of nanonet formation. In order to determine whether nanonets are specific to oyster Cg-BigDef1 or common to other big defensins outside this species, we assessed the potential entrapping of bacteria through nanonets of the big defensin from the scallop Argopecten purpuratus, namely ApBD1. Recombinant ApBD1 was produced as a fusion polypeptide which carried a N-terminal His6 tag, with a thrombin cleavage site before the mature peptide sequence and an unfolded C-terminal domain by mutating the last Cys to Arg. Activity of rApBD1 was assessed against the gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus SG511. rApBD1 inhibited bacterial growth. Moreover, strong immune staining of rApBD1 in numerous areas surrounding bacteria was observed. Overall, results suggest that rApBD1 entrap bacteria in peptide aggregates similar to those reported to Cg-BigDef1. This study demonstrates the conservation of nanonet formation across big defensins and supports further a role for the N-terminal domain in this conserved process.",

    "abstract": "Organelle remodeling is critical for cellular homeostasis, but host factors that control organelle function during microbial infection remain largely uncharacterized. Here, a genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 screen in intestinal epithelial cells with the prototypical intracellular bacterial pathogen Salmonella led us to discover that type I interferon (IFN-I) remodels lysosomes. Even in the absence of infection, IFN-I signaling modified the localization, acidification, protease activity and proteomic profile of lysosomes. Proteomic and genetic analyses revealed that multiple IFN-I-stimulated genes including Ifitm3, Slc15a3, and Cnp contribute to lysosome acidification. IFN-I-dependent lysosome acidification stimulated intracellular Salmonella virulence gene expression, leading to rupture of the Salmonella-containing vacuole and host cell death. Moreover, IFN-I signaling promoted in vivo Salmonella pathogenesis in the intestinal epithelium, where Salmonella initiates infection. Our findings explain how an intracellular bacterial pathogen co-opts epithelial IFN-I signaling. We propose that IFN-I control of lysosome function broadly impacts host defense against diverse viral and microbial pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Multiplexed proteomics using isobaric tagging allows for simultaneously comparing the proteomes of multiple samples. In this technique, digested peptides from each sample are labeled with a chemical tag prior to pooling sample for LC-MS/MS with nanoflow chromatography (NanoLC). The isobaric nature of the tag prevents deconvolution of samples until fragmentation liberates the isotopically labeled reporter ions. To ensure efficient peptide labeling, large concentrations of labeling reagents are included in the reagent kits to allow scientists to use high ratios of chemical label per peptide. The increasing speed and sensitivity of mass spectrometers has reduced the peptide concentration required for analysis, leading to most of the label or labeled sample to be discarded. In conjunction, improvements in the speed of sample loading, reliable pump pressure, and stable gradient construction of analytical flow HPLCs has continued to improve the sample delivery process to the mass spectrometer. In this study we describe a method for performing multiplexed proteomics without the use of NanoLC by using offline fractionation of labeled peptides followed by rapid \"standard flow\" HPLC gradient LC-MS/MS. Standard Flow Multiplexed Proteomics (SFloMPro) enables high coverage quantitative proteomics of up to 16 mammalian samples in about 24 hours. In this study, we compare NanoLC and SFloMPro analysis of fractionated samples. Our results demonstrate that comparable data is obtained by injecting 20 g of labeled peptides per fraction with SFloMPro, compared to 1 g per fraction with NanoLC. We conclude that, for experiments where protein concentration is not strictly limited, SFloMPro is a competitive approach to traditional NanoLC workflows with improved up-time, reliability and at a lower relative cost per sample.\n\nData are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD016704.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=170 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/964379v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c9f848org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cb4711org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a6b7c1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@69f751_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Abstract Graphic\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Venous and arterial thromboses in patients suffering from the autoimmune disorder Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS) are caused by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). Emerging evidence indicates that autoantibodies targeting the epitope R39-R43 in the N-terminal domain, Domain I (DI), of {beta}2-glycoprotein I ({beta}2GPI) are among the most pathogenic aPL in patients with APS. How such autoantibodies engage {beta}2GPI at the molecular level remains incompletely understood. Here, we have used X-ray crystallography, single-molecule FRET, and small-angle X-ray scattering to demonstrate that, in the free form, under physiological pH and salt concentrations, human recombinant {beta}2GPI adopts an elongated, flexible conformation in which DI is exposed to the solvent, thus available for autoantibody recognition. Consistent with this structural model, binding and mutagenesis studies revealed that the elongated form interacts with a pathogenic anti-DI antibody in solution, without the need of phospholipids. Furthermore, complex formation was affected neither by the neighboring domains, nor by the presence of the linkers, nor by the glycosylations. Since the pathogenic autoantibody requires residues R39 and R43 for optimal binding, these findings challenge longstanding postulates in the field envisioning {beta}2GPI adopting immunologic inert conformations featuring inaccessibility of the epitope R39-R43 in DI and support an alternative model whereby the preferential binding of anti-DI antibodies towards phospholipid-bound {beta}2GPI arises from the ability of the pre-existing elongated form to bind to the membranes and then oligomerize, processes that are likely to be supported by protein conformational changes. Interfering with these steps may limit the pathogenic effects of anti-DI antibodies in APS patients.\n\nSignificanceIn the autoimmune disorder called Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS), the presence of autoantibodies targeting the plasma glycoprotein beta-2 glycoprotein I ({beta}2GPI) is associated with arterial and venous thrombosis as well as pregnancy complications. Understanding how {beta}2GPI becomes immunogenic and how autoantibodies in complex with {beta}2GPI cause the blood to clot remains a top priority in the field. By elucidating the structural architecture of {beta}2GPI free in solution, our studies challenge longstanding postulates in the field and shed new light on the pathogenic mechanisms of APS that may help the development of new diagnostics and therapeutic approaches.",

    "abstract": "Behaviours that reliably cause the death of an actor are typically strongly disfavoured by natural selection, and yet many bacteria undergo cell lysis to release anti-competitor toxins [1-4]. This behaviour is most easily explained if only a few cells die to release toxins and help their clonemates, but the number of cells that actually lyse during bacterial warfare is unknown. The challenge is that one cannot distinguish cells that have undergone programmed suicide from those that were simply killed by a competitors toxin. We developed a two-colour fluorescence reporter assay in Escherichia coli to overcome this problem. Surprisingly, this revealed conditions where nearly all cells undergo programmed lysis. Adding a DNA-damaging toxin (DNase colicin) to a focal strain causes it to engage in mass cell suicide where around 85% of cells lyse to release their own toxin. Time-lapse 3D confocal microscopy revealed that self-lysis occurs at even higher frequencies (~94%) at the interface between competing colonies. We sought to understand how such high levels of cell suicide could be favoured by natural selection. Exposing E. coli that do not perform lysis to the DNase colicin revealed that mass lysis only occurs when cells are going to die anyway from toxin exposure. From an evolutionary perspective, this renders the behaviour cost-free as these cells have zero reproductive potential. This explains how mass cell suicide can evolve, as any small benefit to surviving clonemates can lead to the strategy being favoured by natural selection. Our findings have strong parallels to the suicidal attacks of social insects [5-8], which are also performed by individuals with low reproductive potential, suggesting convergent evolution in these very different organisms.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIA novel assay can detect Escherichia coli undergoing cell suicide to release toxins\nC_LIO_LIWe quantified the frequency of suicidal self-lysis during competitions\nC_LIO_LIUnder some conditions, nearly all cells will self-lyse to release toxins\nC_LIO_LISelf-lysis makes evolutionary sense as cells will die anyway from competitors toxins\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSusceptibility to Vibrio cholerae infection is impacted by blood group, age, and pre-existing immunity, but these factors only partially explain who becomes infected. A recent study used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to quantify the composition of the gut microbiome and identify predictive biomarkers of infection with limited taxonomic resolution.\n\nMethodsTo achieve increased resolution of gut microbial factors associated with V. cholerae susceptibility and identify predictors of symptomatic disease, we applied deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing to a cohort of household contacts of patients with cholera.\n\nResultsUsing machine learning, we resolved species, strains, gene families, and cellular pathways in the microbiome at the time of exposure to V. cholerae to identify markers that predict infection and symptoms. Use of metagenomic features improved the precision and accuracy of prediction relative to 16S sequencing. We also predicted disease severity, although with greater uncertainty than our infection prediction. Species within the genera Prevotella and Bifidobacterium predicted protection from infection, and genes involved in iron metabolism also correlated with protection.\n\nConclusionOur results highlight the power of metagenomics to predict disease outcomes and suggest specific species and genes for experimental testing to investigate mechanisms of microbiome-related protection from cholera.\n\nSUMMARYCholera infection and disease severity can be predicted using metagenomic sequencing of the gut microbiome pre-infection in a prospective cohort, and suggests potentially protective bacterial species and genes.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogen peroxide is the preeminent chemical weapon that organisms use for combat. Individual cells rely on conserved defenses to prevent and repair peroxide-induced damage, but whether similar defenses might be coordinated across cells in animals remains poorly understood. Here, we identify a neuronal circuit in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that processes information perceived by two sensory neurons to control the induction of hydrogen-peroxide defenses in the organism. We found that catalases produced by Escherichia coli, the nematodes food source, can deplete hydrogen peroxide from the local environment and thereby protect the nematodes. In the presence of E. coli, the nematodes neurons signal via TGF{beta}-insulin/IGF1 relay to target tissues to repress expression of catalases and other hydrogen-peroxide defenses. This adaptive strategy is the first example of a multicellular organism modulating its defenses when it expects to freeload from the protection provided by molecularly orthologous defenses from another species.",

    "abstract": "Paranoia is the belief that harm is intended by others. It may arise from selective pressures to infer and avoid social threats, particularly in ambiguous or changing circumstances. We propose that uncertainty may be sufficient to elicit learning differences in paranoid individuals, without social threat. We used reversal learning behaviour and computational modelling to estimate belief updating across individuals with and without mental illness, online participants, and rats exposed to chronic methamphetamine, an elicitor of paranoia in humans. Paranoia is associated with a strong but immutable prior on volatility, accompanied by elevated sensitivity to perceived changes in the task environment. Methamphetamine exposure in rats recapitulates this impaired uncertainty-driven belief updating and rigid anticipation of a volatile environment. Our work provides evidence of fundamental, domain-general learning differences in paranoid individuals. This paradigm enables further assessment of the interplay between uncertainty and belief-updating across individuals and species.",

    "abstract": "This work explored hybrid films of silver nanowires (AgNWs) with indium-zinc oxide (IZO) for developing high-performance and low-cost electrocorticography (ECoG) electrodes. The transparent hybrid films achieved a sheet resistance of 6 {Omega}/sq enabling electrodes with 500 m diameter to reach an impedance of 20 k{Omega} at 1 kHz and a charge storage capacity of 3.2 mC/cm2, an improvement in properties over IZO electrodes, whose performance is on par with the classical tin doped indium oxide (ITO). Characterization of light-induced artifacts was performed showing that light intensities <14 mW/mm2 elicit minimal electrical potential variation, which falls within the magnitude of baseline noise. The validation of electrodes in vivo was achieved by recording electrical neural activity from the surface of rat cortex under anaesthesia. Moreover, the presence of the hybrid films did not cause distortion of light during fluorescence microscopy. This study highlighted the capabilities of the hybrid structure of AgNWs with IZO, that can be fabricated with industrially-established processes at low cost, to be used for transparent ECoG electrodes, offering a new way to record neural electrical activity on a large and fast scale with direct visualization of neurons.",

We show for the first time the optoacoustic properties of oxazine-derivative AOI987 probe, which binds to A{beta}, and the application of vMSOT for the quantification of brain-wide A{beta} deposition. Administration of AOI987 to two common transgenic mouse strains of AD amyloidosis led to a retention of the probe in A{beta}-laden brain regions. Co-registered of vMSOT data to a brain atlas revealed strain-specific pattern of AOI987 uptake. A comparison with ex vivo light-sheet microscopy in cleared mouse brains showed a good correspondence in A{beta} distribution. Lastly, we demonstrate the specificity of the AOI987 probe by immunohistochemistry. vMSOT with AOI987 facilitates preclinical brain region-specific studies of A{beta} spread and accumulation, and the monitoring of putative treatments targeting A{beta}.",

    "abstract": "Serotonergic neurons modulate diverse physiological and behavioral processes in a context-dependent manner, based on their complex connectivity. However, their connectivity has not been comprehensively explored at a single-cell resolution. Using a whole-brain EM dataset we determined the wiring logic of a broadly projecting serotonergic neuron (the \"CSDn\") in Drosophila. Within the antennal lobe (AL; first-order olfactory region), the CSDn receives glomerulus-specific input and preferentially targets distinct local interneuron subtypes. Furthermore, the wiring logic of the CSDn differs between olfactory regions. The CSDn innervates the AL and lateral horn (LH), yet does not maintain the same synaptic relationship with individual projection neurons that also span both regions. Consistent with this, the CSDn has more distributed connectivity in the LH relative to the AL, preferentially synapsing with principal neuron types based on presumptive transmitter content. Lastly, we identify protocerebral neurons that provide abundant synaptic input to the CSDn. Our study demonstrates how an individual modulatory neuron can interact with local networks and integrate input from non-olfactory sources.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian rod bipolar (RB) cell pathway is perhaps the best-studied circuit in the vertebrate retina. Its synaptic interactions with other retinal circuits, however, remain unresolved. Here, we combined anatomical and physiological analyses of the mouse retina to discover that the majority of synaptic inhibition to the AII amacrine cell (AC), the central neuron in the RB pathway, is provided by a single interneuron type: a multistratified, axon-bearing GABAergic AC, with dendrites in both ON and OFF synaptic layers, but with a pure ON (depolarizing) response to light. We used the nNOS-CreER mouse retina to confirm the identity of this interneuron as the wide-field NOS-1 AC. Our study demonstrates generally that novel neural circuits can be identified from targeted connectomic analyses and specifically that the NOS-1 AC mediates long-range inhibition during night vision and is a major element of the RB pathway.",

Further analyses consistently identified shared neural representations in the bilateral mid-insula. Mid-insula vicarious pain patterns were not sensitive to capture non-painful arousing negative stimuli but predicted self-experienced pain during thermal stimulation, suggesting process-specific representation of emotional contagion for pain. Finally, a domain-general vicarious pain pattern which predicted vicarious as well as self-experienced pain was developed.

However, functional mapping of the TP with functional magnetic resonance imaging is technically challenging and thus understanding of its interaction with other key emotional circuitry, such as the amygdala, remain elusive. We exploited the unique advantages of stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) to assess the responses of the TP and the amygdala during the perception of emotionally salient stimuli of pictures, music and movies. These stimuli consistently elicited high gamma responses (70-140 Hz) in both the TP and the amygdala, accompanied by functional connectivity in the low frequency range (2-12 Hz). Computational analyses suggested the TP driving this effect in the theta-alpha frequency range and which was modulated by the emotional salience of the stimuli. Of note, cross-frequency analysis indicated the phase of theta-alpha oscillations in the TP modulated the amplitude of high gamma activity in the amygdala. These results were reproducible with three types of stimuli including naturalistic stimuli suggesting a hierarchical influence of the TP over the amygdala in non-threatening stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Replication-coupled (RC) nucleosome assembly is an essential process in eukaryotic cells in order to maintain chromatin structure during DNA replication. The deposition of newly synthesized H3/H4 histones during DNA replication is facilitated by specialized histone chaperones. Although the contribution of these histone chaperones to genomic stability has been thoroughly investigated, their effect on replisome progression is much less understood. By exploiting a time-lapse microscopy system for monitoring DNA replication in individual live cells, we examined how mutations in key histone chaperones including CAC1, RTT106, RTT109 and ASF1, affect replication fork progression. Our experiments revealed that mutations in CAC1 or RTT106 that directly deposit histones on the DNA, slowdown replication fork progression. In contrast, analysis of cells mutated in the intermediary ASF1 or RTT109 histone chaperones revealed that replisome progression is not affected. We found that mutations in histone chaperones including ASF1 and RTT109 lead to extended G2/M duration, elevated number of RPA foci and in some cases, increased spontaneous mutation rate. Our research suggests that histone chaperones have distinct roles in enabling high replisome progression and maintaining genome stability during cell cycle progression.\n\nAuthor SummaryHistone chaperones (HC) play key roles in maintaining the chromatin structure during DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. Despite extensive studies on HCs, little is known regarding their importance for replication fork progression during S-phase. Here, we utilized a live-cell imaging approach to measure the progression rates of single replication forks in individual yeast cells mutated in key histone chaperones. Using this approach, we show that mutations in CAC1 or RTT106 HCs that directly deposit histones on the DNA lead to slowdown of replication fork progression. In contrast, mutations in ASF1 or RTT109 HCs that transfers H3/H4 to CAC1 or RTT106, do not affect replisome progression but lead to post replication defects. Our results reveal distinct functions of HCs in replication fork progression and maintaining genome stability.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of high-throughput technologies, life sciences are generating a huge amount of biomolecular data. Global gene expression profiles provide a snapshot of all the genes that are transcribed or not in a cell or in a tissue at a particular moment under a particular condition. The high-dimensionality of such gene expression data (i.e., very large number of features/genes analyzed in relatively much less number of samples) makes it difficult to identify the key genes (biomarkers) that are truly and more significantly attributing to a particular phenotype or condition, such as cancer or disease, de novo. With the increase in the number of genes, simple feature selection methods show poor performance for both selecting the effective and informative features and capturing biological information. Addressing these issues, here we propose Mutual information based Gene Selection method (MGS) for selecting informative genes and two ranking methods based on frequency (MGSf) and Random Forest (MGSrf) for ranking the selected genes. We tested our methods on four real gene expression datasets derived from different studies on cancerous and normal samples. Our methods obtained better classification rate with the datasets compared to recently reported methods. Our methods could also detect the key relevant pathways with a causal relationship to the phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Neuroblast migration is a critical aspect of nervous system development (e.g., neural crest migration). In an unbiased forward genetic screen, we identified a novel player in neuroblast migration, the ETR-1/CELF1 RNA binding protein. CELF1 RNA binding proteins are involved in multiple aspects of RNA processing including alternative splicing, stability, and translation. We find that a specific mutation in alternatively-spliced exon 8 results in migration defects of the AQR and PQR neurons, and not the embryonic lethality and body wall muscle defects of complete knockdown of the locus. Surprisingly, ETR-1 was required in body wall muscle cells for AQR/PQR migration (i.e. it acts cell non-autonomously). Genetic interactions indicate that ETR-1 acts with Wnt signaling, either in the Wnt pathway or in a parallel pathway. Possibly, ETR-1 is involved in the production of a Wnt signal or a parallel signal by the body wall muscles that controls AQR and PQR neuronal migration. In humans, CELF1 is involved in a number of neuromuscular disorders. If the role of ETR-1/CELF1 is conserved, these disorders might also involve cell or neuronal migration. Finally, we describe a technique of amplicon sequencing to detect rare, cell-specific genome edits by CRISPR/Cas9 in vivo (CRISPR-seq) as an alternative to the T7E1 assay.",

    "abstract": "Pluripotent state can be established via reprogramming of somatic nuclei by factors within an oocyte or by ectopic expression of a few transgenes. Considered as being extensive and intensive, the full complement of genes to be reprogrammed, however, has never been defined, nor has the degree of reprogramming been determined quantitatively. Here, we propose a new concept of reprogramome, which is defined as the full complement of genes that need to be reprogrammed to the expression levels found in pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). This concept in combination with RNA-seq enables us to precisely profile reprogramome and sub-reprogramomes, and study the reprogramming process with the help of other available tools such as GO analyses. With reprogramming of human fibroblasts into PSCs as an example, we have defined the full complement of the human fibroblast-to-PSC reprogramome. Furthermore, our analyses of the reprogramome revealed that WNT pathways and genes with roles in cellular morphogenesis have to be extensively and intensely reprogrammed for the establishment of pluripotency. We further developed the first mathematical model to quantitate the overall reprogramming, as well as reprogramming in a specific cellular feature such as WNT signaling pathways and genes regulating cellular morphogenesis. We anticipate that our concept and mathematical model may be applied to study and quantitate other reprogramming (pluripotency reprogramming from other somatic cells, and lineage reprogramming), as well as transcriptional and epigenetic differences between any two types of cells including cancer cells and their normal counterparts.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Zika AIRS Project, a USAID-funded initiative worked across the Latin America and Caribbean regions from 2016 to 2019, as an emergency to contain the spread of the Zika virus. All entomological records in the target countries showed wide distribution and high abundance of Aedes aegypti populations, however the susceptibility profiles of these insects to insecticides commonly employed by vector control campaigns were in most cases incomplete or inexistent. In close collaboration with the Ministries of Health of individual countries, Zika-AIRS teams conducted insecticide susceptibility testing of an array of insecticides in A. aegypti populations of each country. Procedures applied met the standard international protocols instructed by the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMethodology and main findingsThe insecticides tested were selected under categories such as pyrethroids, organophosphates and carbamate. Results showed A. aegypti populations displaying high and widely distributed resistance to all pyrethroids across countries, tolerance to organophosphates and full susceptibility to a carbamate. Key inconsistencies between testing methods are presented and discussed. Additionally, four kdr mutations were analyzed to detect molecular mechanisms of insecticide resistance. The screening for kdr mutations suggested the widespread nature of V1016I mutation, linked to pyrethroid resistance in A. aegypti populations distributed and sampled in the above mentioned regions.\n\nConclusions and perspectivesThis multi-country study contributes with updated information to the public health decision-makers across Central America and the Caribbean. This study provided training and established technical networks for more effective and sustainable insecticide surveillance programs. Most but not all records of insecticide resistance in A. aegypti were consistent between methodologies, thus inconsistent issues are discussed here to call for further improvement in procedures and convey more practical guidelines for surveillance teams in countries where Aedes-borne diseases are endemic.\n\nAuthor summaryAt the forefront of the fight against arboviruses transmission is the insecticide-based vector control. All countries in the Latin American and Caribbean region invest valuable resources from their limited budget to acquire and implement insecticide-based tools, with non-existent or weak insecticide resistance monitoring programs. Hence, the USAID-funded Zika AIRS Project (ZAP) collaborated with the Ministries of Health of multiple countries to update the profile of susceptibility to insecticides in Aedes aegypti populations. We found widespread resistance to pyrethroid and organophosphate insecticides, which account to almost 100% of the products available to control adult mosquitoes. As we used both of World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention standard methods, we found many similarities and some inconsistencies in the susceptibility profiles obtained for the very same vector populations. Additionally, we obtained insight on potential molecular mechanisms of resistance across the countries, finding the kdr mutation V1016I possibly involved in loss of susceptibility.\n\nThis study is the biggest cross-country update of insecticide resistance for Aedes aegypti in years, and it should be used as evidence for improving the selection of insecticides in these countries and a call for further support to maintain insecticide resistance monitoring programs.",

    "abstract": "Chromosome abnormalities are well documented in human spontaneous abortion studies, yet rarely reported in domesticated animals. Rodent models have previously been used to study the effects of maternal ageing on oocyte quality and ultimately aneuploidy, however the differing endocrine profiles, oocyte characteristics and the polytocous nature of rodents are limitations for translation into human medicine. Early Pregnancy Loss (EPL) occurs in 5-10% of confirmed equine pregnancies and has no diagnosis in over 80% of cases. Aneuploidy has never been described in equine pregnancy loss, thus the objectives of this study were to quantify the frequency and characteristics of aneuploidy associated with equine EPL. EPL conceptuses were submitted from clinical cases of spontaneous pregnancy loss (14-65 days of gestation) between 2013 and 2018. Age matched control conceptuses were obtained from terminated clinically normal pregnancies (CNP). Aneuploidy was detected in 12/55 EPLs (21.8%), 0/10 CNP, 0/5 healthy term chorioallantois, and 0/5 healthy adult mares via genotyping. Whole genome sequencing (30X) and ddPCR validated results. Aneuploidies involved 10/32 equine chromosomes, consisting of nine trisomies and three monosomies. Autosomal aneuploidies were detected in both placental and fetal compartments in all samples tested. Aneuploid types (7/9) were mostly unique to EPL, supporting their embryonic/fetal lethality. Presenting the first evidence of aneuploidies in failed equine pregnancies not only provides the initial step in identifying genetic causes for these early losses, but also offers the horse as a new model for studying naturally occurring aneuploidy. We also demonstrate that SNP arrays provide a simple, cost effective way to screen aneuploidies across a large population.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe first 8 weeks of pregnancy is a critical time in both humans and horses, as the majority of pregnancy losses occur during this period. Despite such high prevalence, many cases do not have a known cause. Abnormal chromosome number (aneuploidy) is the most common finding in human pregnancy loss studies, but to date no equivalent study has been performed in domesticated animals, including the horse. We studied the genetics of naturally occurring pregnancy losses from Thoroughbred horses and found a similar level of aneuploidy to that observed in women. As humans and horses share similarities in their reproductive biology (ageing eggs, increased pregnancy loss in older mothers, similar key hormones), we suggest that by comparing the genetics of these two species, greater advances in identifying causes of aneuploidy pregnancy can be reached. Thoroughbred horses also tend to be more inbred than humans, facilitating the identification of mutations that increase the chance of aneuploidy, and this knowledge could potentially be applied in human medicine, as well as in species conservation.",

    "abstract": "The development of effective vaccines against bacterial lung infections requires the induction of protective, pathogen-specific immune responses without deleterious inflammation within the pulmonary environment. Here, we made use of a polysaccharide-adjuvanted vaccine approach to elicit resident pulmonary T cells to protect against aerosol Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Intratracheal administration of the multistage fusion protein CysVac2 and the delta-inulin adjuvant Advax (formulated with a TLR9 agonist) provided superior protection against aerosol M. tuberculosis infection in mice, compared to parenteral delivery. Surprisingly, removal of the TLR9 agonist did not impact vaccine protection despite a reduction in cytokine-secreting T cell subsets, particularly CD4+ IFN-{gamma}+IL-2+TNF+ multifunctional T cells. CysVac2/Advax-mediated protection was associated with the induction of lung-resident, antigen-specific memory CD4+ T cells that expressed IL-17 and ROR{gamma}t, the master transcriptional regulator of Th17 differentiation. IL-17 was identified as a key mediator of vaccine efficacy, with blocking of IL-17 during M. tuberculosis challenge reducing phagocyte influx, suppressing priming of pathogen-specific CD4+ T cells in local lymph nodes and ablating vaccine-induced protection. These findings suggest that tuberculosis vaccines such as CysVac2/Advax that are capable of eliciting Th17 lung-resident memory T cells are promising candidates for progression to human trials.\n\nImportanceMycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), kills more individuals each year than any other single pathogen. The only approved vaccine, BCG, administered intradermally, is unreliable in protecting against pulmonary TB, therefore a more effective vaccine is critical for global control of the disease. Vaccination in the lung would be a rational way of inducing a local memory immune response to TB, however vaccine platforms would need to deliver antigens to delicate mucosal surfaces without inducing deleterious inflammatory responses. We developed a safe mucosal vaccine which induced protection against TB lung infection in mice by inducing high levels of lung-resident T cells expressing the cytokine IL-17. Removal of IL-17 limited the influx of phagocytic cells to the lung and completely ablated protection afforded by the vaccine. This study provides new insights into mechanisms of protection against M. tuberculosis and provides a promising candidate to protect against TB in humans.",

P1, a key protein for RYMV, was reported as a potent RNAi suppressor counteracting RNA silencing in plant reporter systems. Here we describe the complete 3D structure and dynamics of P1. Its N-terminal region contains ZnF1, a structural CCCC-type zinc finger strongly affine to zinc and a prominent short helix, rendering this region poorly amenable to structural changes. P1 C-terminal region contains ZnF2, an atypical HCHC-type ZnF that does not belong to any existing class of Zn finger proteins. ZnF2 appeared much less affine to zinc and more sensitive to oxidizing environments than ZnF1, and may serve as a sensor of plant redox status. The structure helped us to identify key residues essential for RYMV infectivity and spread in rice tissues through their participation in P1 oligomerization and folding. Altogether, our results provide the first complete structure of an antiviral silencing suppressor encoded by a virus infecting rice and highlight P1 structural and dynamical properties that may serve RYMV functions to infect and invade its host plant.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The epidemiology of Congenital Heart Diseases (CHDs) has changed over the past twenty years.\n\nWe evaluated the prevalence of CHDs in the population of dogs recruited in a single referral center (RC); compared the epidemiological features of CHDs in screened breeds (Boxers) versus nonscreened (French and English Bulldogs and German Shepherds), investigated the association of breeds with the prevalence of CHDs, determined the popularity and volatility of breeds over a 20-year period; and analysed the trends of the most popular breeds in the overall population of new-born dogs registered in the Italian Kennel Club from 1st January 1997 to 31st December 2017.\n\nThis was a retrospective observational study, the cardiological database of the RC was analysed, and 1,779 clinical records fulfilled the inclusion criteria.\n\nDescriptive statistics and frequencies regarding the most representative breeds and CHDs were generated. A logistic regression model was used to analyse the trends of the most common CHDs found in single breeds (French Bulldog, English Bulldog, Boxer, and German Shepherd), and in groups of breeds (brachycephalic breeds and the most represented large breeds). The relationships between the breed popularity and the presence of CHDs was studied.\n\nThe most common CHDs were Pulmonic Stenosis (34,1%), Patent Ductus Arteriosus (26,4%), Subaortic Stenosis (14,6%), Ventricular Septal Defect (4,8%), Aortic Stenosis (4,7%), Tricuspid Dysplasia (3,4%), Atrial Septal Defect (1,9%), Double Chamber Right ventricle (1,8%), Mitral Dysplasia (1,6%), and reverse Patent Ductus Arteriosus (0,7%). The most represented pure breeds were Boxer (19,4%), German Shepherd (9,4%), French Bulldog (6,2%), English Bulldog (4,9%), Maltese (3,7%), Newfoundland (3,1%), Rottweiler (3,1%), Golden Retriever (3,0%), Chihuahua (2,8%), Poodle (2,5%), Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (2,2%), American Staffordshire Terrier (2,1%), Labrador Retriever (2,3%), Dobermann (2,1%), Miniature Pinscher (2,0%), Cocker Spaniel (2,0%), Yorkshire Terrier (1,7%), Dogue de Bordeaux (1,6%), Dachshund (1,6%), and Bull Terrier (1,5%). Chihuahuas, American Staffordshire Terriers, Border Collies, French Bulldogs, and Cavalier King Charles Spaniel were the most appreciated small and medium breeds, all of which showed a high value of volatility.\n\nIn conclusion, this study found evidence for the value of the screening program implemented in Boxers, which decreased the prevalence of Subaortic Stenosis and Pulmonic Stenosis. However, fashions and trends influence dog owners choices more than the worries of health problems frequently found in a breed. Effective breeding programs are needed in order to control the diffusion of CHDs without impoverishing the genetic pool; in addition, dog owners should be educated, and the breeders supported by a network of veterinary cardiology centers.",

Through the use of molecular dynamics simulations and enhanced sampling techniques, we provide a systematic and detailed characterisation of the human CE-CTD interface, describing the effect of the CTD phosphorylation state, length and orientation on this interaction. Our computational analyses identify novel CTD interaction sites on the human CE surface and quantify their relative contributions to CTD binding. We also identify differences in the CTD binding conformation when phosphorylated at either the Serine-2 or Serine-5 positions, thus providing insights into how the CE reads the CTD code. The computational findings are then validated by binding and activity assays. These novel CTD interaction sites are compared with cocrystal structures of the CE-CTD complex in different eukaryotic taxa, leading to the conclusion that this interface is considerably more conserved than previous structures have indicated.",

    "abstract": "The opportunistic pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is ubiquitous in the environment, and in humans is capable of causing acute and chronic infections. P. aeruginosa, when co-incubated with the bacterivorous amoeba, Acanthamoeba castellanii, for extended periods, produced genetic and phenotypic variants. Sequencing of late-stage amoeba-adapted P. aeruginosa isolates demonstrated single nucleotide polymorphisms within genes that encode known virulence factors, and this correlated with a reduction in expression of virulence traits. Virulence towards the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, was attenuated in late-stage amoeba-adapted P. aeruginosa compared to early stage amoeba-adapted and non-adapted counterparts. Late-stage amoeba-adapted P. aeruginosa lost competitive fitness compared to non-adapted counterparts when grown in nutrient rich media. However, non-adapted P. aeruginosa were rapidly cleared by amoeba predation, whereas late-stage amoeba-adapted isolates remained in higher numbers 24 h after ingestion by amoeba. In addition, there was reduced uptake by macrophage of amoeba-adapted isolates and reduced uptake by human neutrophils as well as increased survival in the presence of neutrophils. Our findings indicate that the selection imposed by amoeba on P. aeruginosa resulted in reduced virulence over time. Importantly, the genetic and phenotypic traits possessed by late-stage amoeba-adapted P. aeruginosa are similar to what is observed for isolates obtained from chronic cystic fibrosis infections. This notable overlap in adaptation to different host types suggests similar selection pressures among host cell types.\n\nAuthor SummaryPseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that causes both acute infections in plants and animals, including humans and also causes chronic infections in immune compromised and cystic fibrosis patients. This bacterium is commonly found in soils and water where bacteria are constantly under threat of being consumed by the bacterial predators, protozoa. To escape being killed, bacteria have evolved a suite of mechanisms that protect them from being consumed or digested. Here we examined the effect of long-term predation on the genotype and phenotypes expressed by P. aeruginosa. We show that long-term co-incubation with protozoa resulted in mutations in the bacteria that made them less pathogenic. This is particularly interesting as we see similar mutations arise in bacteria associated with chronic infections. Thus, predation by protozoa and long term colonization of the human host may represent similar environments that select for similar losses in gene functions.",

    "abstract": "Capsule-forming extracellular polysaccharides are crucial to bacterial host colonization, invasion, immune evasion and ultimately pathogenicity. Due to warming ocean waters and human encroachment of coastal ecosystems, Vibrio parahaemolyticus has emerged as a globally important food-borne enteropathogen implicated in acute gastroenteritis, wound infections, and septic shock. Conventionally, the antigenic properties of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, O antigen) and capsular polysaccharide (CPS, K antigen) have provided a basis for serotyping V. parahaemolyticus, while disclosure of genetic elements encoding 13 O-serogroups have allowed molecular serotyping methods to be developed. However, the genetic structure of CPS loci for 71 K-serogroups has remained unidentified, limiting progress in understanding its roles in V. parahaemolyticus pathophysiology. In this study, we identified and characterized the genetic structure and their evolutionary relationship of CPS loci of 40 K-serogroups through whole genome sequencing of 443 V. parahaemolyticus strains. We found a distinct pattern of CPS gene cluster across different K-serogroups, and expanded its new right-border by identifying glpX as a key gene conserved across all serotypes. A total of 217 genes involved in CPS biosynthesis were annotated. Functional contents and genetic structure of the 40 K-serogroups were analyzed. Based on inferences from species trees and gene trees, we proposed an evolution model of the CPS gene clusters of 40 K-serogroups. Horizontal gene transfer by recombination from other Vibrio species, gene duplication and nonsense mutations are likely to play instrumental roles in the evolution of CPS in V. parahaemolyticus. It is the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that a large-scale of CPS gene clusters of different K-serogroups in V. parahaemolyticus have been identified and characterized in evolutionary contexts. This work should help advance understanding on the variation of CPS in V. parahaemolyticus, and provide a framework for developing diagnostically relevant serotyping methods.\n\nAuthor summaryDue to warming ocean waters and human encroachment of coastal ecosystems, Vibrio parahaemolyticus has emerged as a globally important food-borne enteropathogen.
