    "abstract": "Adoption of microorganisms as platforms for sustainable biobased production requires host cells to be able to withstand harsh industrial conditions, which are usually far from the ones where these organisms are naturally adapted to thrive. However, novel survival mechanisms unearthed by the study of microbiomes from extreme habitats may be exploited to enhance microbial robustness under the strict conditions needed for different applications. In this work, synthetic biology approaches were used to engineer enhanced acidic tolerance in Escherichia coli under extreme conditions through the characterization of a library of twenty-seven unique operons composed of combinatorial assemblies of three novel genes from an extreme environment and three synthetic ribosome binding sites. The results here presented illustrate the efficacy of combining different metagenomic genes for tolerance in truly synthetic genetic operons, as expression of these gene clusters increased hundred-fold the survival percentage of cells exposed to an acidic shock in minimal media at pH 1.9 under aerobic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Animals living in social groups navigate challenges when competing and cooperating with other group members. Changes in demographics, dominance hierarchies or ecological factors, such as food availability or disease prevalence, are expected to influence decision-making processes regarding social interactions. Therefore, it could be expected individuals show flexibility in social behaviour over time to maximise the fitness benefits of social living. To date, research across species has shown that stable inter-individual differences in social behaviour exist, but mostly over relatively short data collection time periods. Using data spanning over 20 years, we demonstrate that multiple social behaviours are repeatable over the long-term in wild chimpanzees, a long-lived species occupying a complex fission-fusion society. We controlled for temporal, ecological and demographic changes, limiting pseudo-repeatability. We conclude that chimpanzees living in natural ecological settings have relatively stable long-term social phenotypes over years that may be independent of life history stage or strategies. Our results add to the growing body of literature suggesting consistent individual differences in social tendencies are more likely the rule rather than the exception in group-living animals.",

We developed a stochastic mathematical model of tumor evolution and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) shedding to determine the potential and the limitations of cancer early detection tests. We inferred normalized ctDNA shedding rates from 176 early stage lung cancer subjects and calculated that a 15 mL blood sample contains on average 1.7 genome equivalents of ctDNA for lung tumors with a volume of 1 cm3. For annual screening, the model predicts median detection sizes between 3.8 and 6.6 cm3 corresponding to lead times between 310 and 450 days compared to current lung tumor sizes at diagnosis. For monthly cancer relapse testing based on 20 a priori known mutations, the model predicts a median detection size of 0.26 cm3 corresponding to a lead time of 150 days. This mechanistic framework can help to optimize early cancer detection approaches.",

However, the underlying mechanisms affecting the spatiotemporal organization of DOM composition are under-investigated. To understand the principles governing DOM composition, we leverage the recently proposed synthesis of metacommunity ecology and metabolomics, termed  meta-metabolome ecology. Applying this novel approach to a freshwater ecosystem, we demonstrated that despite similar molecular properties across metabolomes, metabolite identity significantly diverged due to environmental filtering. We refer to this phenomenon as  thermodynamic redundancy, which is analogous to the ecological concept of functional redundancy. We suggest that under thermodynamic redundancy, divergent metabolomes can support equivalent biogeochemical function just as divergent ecological communities can support equivalent ecosystem function. As these analyses are performed in additional ecosystems, potentially generalizable principles, like thermodynamic redundancy, can be revealed and provide insight into DOM dynamics.",

Many rare genetic variants have been associated with DCM, but common variant studies of the disease have yielded few associated loci. As structural changes in the heart are a defining feature of DCM, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived left ventricular measurements in 29,041 UK Biobank participants. 26 novel loci were associated with cardiac structure and function. These loci were found near 17 genes previously shown to cause Mendelian cardiomyopathies. A polygenic score of left ventricular end systolic volume was associated with incident DCM in previously disease-free individuals (hazard ratio = 1.54 per one standard deviation increase in the polygenic score, P = 2.1x10-16). Even among carriers of truncating mutations in TTN, the polygenic score influenced the size and function of the heart. These results further implicate common genetic polymorphisms in DCM pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides high-dimensional measurement of transcript counts in individual cells. However, high assay costs limit the study of large numbers of samples. Sample multiplexing technologies such as antibody hashing and MULTI-seq use sample-specific sequence tags to enable individual samples (e.g., different patients) to be sequenced in a pooled format before downstream computational demultiplexing. Critically, no study to date has evaluated whether the mixing of samples from different donors in this manner results in significant changes in gene expression resulting from alloreactivity (i.e., response to non-self immune antigens). The ability to demonstrate minimal to no alloreactivity is crucial to avoid confounded data analyses, particularly for cross-sectional studies evaluating changes in immunologic gene signatures. Here, we compared the expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a single donor with and without pooling with PBMCs isolated from other donors with different blood types. We find that there was no evidence of alloreactivity in the multiplexed samples following three distinct multiplexing workflows (antibody hashing, MULTI-seq, and in silico genotyping using souporcell). Moreover, we identified biases amongst antibody hashing sample classification results in this particular experimental system, as well as gene expression signatures linked to PBMC preparation method (e.g., Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation with or without apheresis using Trima filtration).",

    "abstract": "Meis1, which belongs to TALE-type class of homeobox gene family, appeared as one of the key regulators of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal and a potential therapeutical target. However, small molecule inhibitors of MEIS1 remained unknown. This led us to develop inhibitors of MEIS1 that could modulate HSC activity. To this end, we have established a library of relevant homeobox family inhibitors and developed a high-throughput in silico screening strategy against homeodomain of MEIS proteins using the AutoDock Vina and PaDEL-ADV platform. We have screened over a million druggable small molecules in silico and selected putative MEIS inhibitors (MEISi) with no predicted cytotoxicity or cardiotoxicity. This was followed by in vitro validation of putative MEIS inhibitors using MEIS dependent luciferase reporter assays and analysis in the ex vivo HSC assays. We have shown that small molecules named MEISi-1 and MEISi-2 significantly inhibit MEIS-luciferase reporters in vitro and induce murine (LSKCD34low cells) and human (CD34+, CD133+, and ALDHhi cells) HSC self-renewal ex vivo. In addition, inhibition of MEIS proteins results in downregulation of Meis1 and MEIS1 target gene expression including Hif-1, Hif-2 and HSC quiescence modulators. MEIS inhibitors are effective in vivo as evident by induced HSC content in the murine bone marrow and downregulation of expression of MEIS target genes. These studies warrant identification of first-in-class MEIS inhibitors as potential pharmaceuticals to be utilized in modulation of HSC activity and bone marrow transplantation studies.",

    "abstract": "The manner in which humans exploit multisensory information for subsequent decisions changes with age. Multiple causes for such age-effects are being discussed, including a reduced precision in peripheral sensory representations, changes in cognitive inference about causal relations between sensory cues, and a decline in memory contributing to altered sequential patterns of multisensory behaviour. To dissociate these putative contributions, we investigated how healthy young and older adults integrate audio-visual spatial information within trials (the ventriloquism effect) and between trials (the ventriloquism aftereffect). With both a model-free and (Bayesian) model-based analyses we found that both biases differed between groups. Our results attribute the age-change in the ventriloquism bias to a decline in spatial hearing rather than a change in cognitive processes. This decline in peripheral function, combined with a more prominent influence from preceding responses rather than preceding stimuli in the elderly, can also explain the observed age-effect in the ventriloquism aftereffect. Our results suggest a transition from a sensory- to a behavior-driven influence of past multisensory experience on perceptual decisions with age, due to reduced sensory precision and change in memory capacity.",

    "abstract": "The BOLD signal, as the basis of functional MRI, arises from both neuronal and vascular factors, with their respective contributions to resting state-fMRI still unknown. Among the factors contributing to \"physiological noise\", dynamic arterial CO2 fluctuations constitutes the strongest and the most widespread modulator of the grey-matter rs-fMRI signal. Some important questions are: (1) if we were able to clamp arterial CO2 such that fluctuations are removed, what would happen to rs-fMRI measures? (2) falling short of that, is it possible to retroactively correct for CO2 effects with equivalent outcome? In this study 13 healthy subjects underwent two rs-fMRI acquisition: During the \"clamped\" run, end-tidal CO2 (PETCO2) is clamped to the average PETCO2 level of each participant, while during the \"free-breathing\" run, the PETCO2 level is passively monitored but not controlled. PETCO2 correction was applied to the free-breathing data by convolving PETCO2 with its BOLD response function, and then regressing out the result. We computed the BOLD resting-state fluctuation amplitude (RSFA), as well as seed-independent mean functional connectivity (FC) as the weighted global brain connectivity (wGBC). Furthermore, connectivity between conditions were compared using coupled intrinsic-connectivity distribution (ICD) method. We ensured that PETCO2 clamping did not significantly alter heart-beat and respiratory variation. We found that neither PETCO2 clamping nor correction produced significant change in RSFA and wGBC. In terms of the ICD, PETCO2 clamping and correction both reduced FC strength in the majority of grey matter regions, although the effect of PETCO2 correction is considerably smaller than the effect of PETCO2 clamping. Furthermore, while PETCO2 clamping reduced inter-subject variability in FC, PETCO2 correction increased the variability. Overall PETCO2 correction is not the equivalent of PETCO2 clamping, although it shifts FC values towards the same direction as clamping does.",

    "abstract": "Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) are prominent for their annual long-distance migration from North America to its overwintering area in Central Mexico. To find their way on this long journey, they use a sun compass as their main orientation reference but will also adjust their migratory direction with respect to mountain ranges. This indicates that the migratory butterflies also attend to the panorama to guide their travels. Here we studied if non-migrating butterflies - that stay in a more restricted area to feed and breed - also use a similar compass system to guide their flights. Performing behavioral experiments on tethered flying butterflies in an indoor LED flight simulator, we found that the monarchs fly along straight tracks with respect to a simulated sun. When a panoramic skyline was presented as the only orientation cue, the butterflies maintained their flight direction only during short sequences suggesting that they potentially use it for flight stabilization. We further found that when we presented the two cues together, the butterflies register both cues in their compass. Taken together, we here show that non-migrating monarch butterflies can combine multiple visual cues for robust orientation, an ability that may also aid them during their migration.\n\nSummaryNon-migrating butterflies keep directed courses when viewing a simulated sun or panoramic scene. This suggest that they orient based on multiple visual cues independent of their migratory context.",

    "abstract": "Spider silk spidroins consist of long repetitive protein strands, flanked by globular terminal domains. The globular domains are often omitted in recombinant spidroins, but are thought to be essential for the spiders natural spinning process. Mimicking this spinning process could be an essential step towards producing strong synthetic spider silk. Here we describe the production of a range of mini-spidroins with both terminal domains, and characterize their response to a number of biomimetic spinning triggers. Our results suggest that the inclusion of the terminal domains is needed to match the response to shear that native spidroins exhibit. Our results also suggest that a pH drop alone is insufficient to trigger assembly in a wet-spinning process, and must be combined with salting-out for effective fiber formation. With these insights, we applied these assembly triggers for relatively biomimetic wet spinning. This work adds to the foundation of literature for developing improved biomimetic spinning techniques, which ought to result in synthetic silk that more closely approximates the unique properties of native spider silk.",

    "abstract": "Cover cropping is considered a cornerstone practice in sustainable agriculture; however, little attention has been paid to the cover crop production supply chain. In this Perspective, we estimate land use requirements to supply the United States maize production area with cover crop seed, finding that across 18 cover crops, on average 3.8% (median 2.0%) of current production area would be required, with the popular cover crops rye and hairy vetch requiring as much as 4.5% and 11.9%, respectively. The latter land requirement is comparable to the annual amount of maize grain lost to disease in the U.S. We highlight avenues for reducing these high land use costs.",

    "abstract": "Infectious diseases are one of the most important constraints to livestock agriculture, and hence food, nutritional and economic security in developing countries. In any livestock system, the movement of animals is key to production and sustainability. This is especially true in pastoralist systems where animal movement occurs for a myriad of social, ecological, economic and management reasons. Understanding the dynamics of livestock movement within an ecosystem is important for disease surveillance and control, yet there is limited data available on the dynamics of animal movement in such populations. The aim of this study was to investigate animal transfer networks in a pastoralist community in Kenya, and assess network-based strategies for disease control. We used network analysis to characterize five types of animal transfer networks and evaluated implications of these networks for disease control through quantifying topological changes in the network because of targeted or random removal of nodes. To construct these networks, data were collected using a standardized questionnaire (N=164 households) from communities living within the Maasai Mara Ecosystem in southwestern Kenya. The median livestock movement distance for agistment (dry season grazing) was 39.49 kilometers (22.03-63.49 km), while that for gift, bride price, buying and selling were 13.97 km (0-40.30 km), 30.75 km (10.02-66.03 km), 31.14 km (17.56-59.08 km), and 33.21 km (17.78-58.49 km), respectively. Our analyses show that the Maasai Mara National Reserve, a protected area, was critical for maintaining connectivity in the agistment network. In addition, villages closer to the Maasai Mara National Reserve were regularly used for dry season grazing. In terms of disease control, targeted removal of highly connected village nodes was more effective at fragmenting each network than random removal of nodes, indicating that network-based targeting of interventions such as vaccination could potentially disrupt transmission pathways and reduce pathogen circulation in the ecosystem. In conclusion, this work shows that animal movements have the potential to shape patterns of disease transmission and control in this ecosystem. Further, we show that targeted control is a more practical and efficient measure for disease control.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), is a globally invasive pest and plant virus vector on a wide array of food, fiber and ornamental crops. While there are numerous studies centered on thrips pest and vector biology, feeding behaviors, ecology, and insecticide resistance, the underlying genetic mechanisms of the processes governing these areas of research are largely unknown. To address this gap, we present the F. occidentalis draft genome assembly and official gene set.\n\nResultsWe report on the first genome sequence for any member of the insect order Thysanoptera. Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Ortholog (BUSCO) assessments of the genome assembly (size = 415.8 Mb, scaffold N50 = 948.9 Kb) revealed a relatively complete and well-annotated assembly in comparison to other insect genomes. The genome is unusually GC-rich (50%) compared to other insect genomes to date. The official gene set (OGS v1.0) contains 16,859 genes, of which [~]10% were manually verified and corrected by our consortium. We focused on manual annotation, phylogenetic and expression evidence analyses for gene sets centered on primary themes in the life histories and activities of plant-colonizing insects. Highlights include: 1) divergent clades and large expansions in genes associated with environmental sensing (chemosensory receptors) and detoxification (CYP4, CYP6 and CCE enzymes) of substances encountered in agricultural environments; 2) a comprehensive set of salivary gland-associated genes supported by enriched expression; 3) apparent absence of members of the IMD innate immune defense pathway; and 4) developmental- and sex-specific expression analyses of genes associated with progression from larvae to adulthood through neometaboly, a distinct form of maturation compared to complete metamorphosis in the Holometabola.\n\nConclusionsAnalysis of the F. occidentalis genome offers insights into the polyphagous behavior of this insect pest to find, colonize and survive on a widely diverse array of plants. The genomic resources presented here enable a more complete analysis of insect evolution and biology, providing a missing taxon for contemporary insect genomics-based analyses. Our study also offers a genomic benchmark for molecular and evolutionary investigations of other thysanopteran species.",

    "abstract": "Genomic prediction of complex human traits (e.g., height, cognitive ability, bone density) and disease risks (e.g., breast cancer, diabetes, heart disease, atrial fibrillation) has advanced considerably in recent years. Predictors have been constructed using penalized algorithms that favor sparsity: i.e., which use as few genetic variants as possible. We analyze the specific genetic variants (SNPs) utilized in these predictors, which can vary from dozens to as many as thirty thousand. We find that the fraction of SNPs in or near genic regions varies widely by phenotype. For the majority of disease conditions studied, a large amount of the variance is accounted for by SNPs outside of coding regions. The state of these SNPs cannot be determined from exome-sequencing data. This suggests that exome data alone will miss much of the heritability for these traits - i.e., existing PRS cannot be computed from exome data alone. We also study the fraction of SNPs and of variance that is in common between pairs of predictors. The DNA regions used in disease risk predictors so far constructed seem to be largely disjoint (with a few interesting exceptions), suggesting that individual genetic disease risks are largely uncorrelated. It seems possible in theory for an individual to be a low-risk outlier in all conditions simultaneously.",

    "abstract": "Although many bacterial cell division factors have been uncovered over the years, evidence from recent studies points to the existence of yet to be discovered factors involved in cell division regulation. Thus, it is important to identify factors and conditions that regulate cell division to obtain a better understanding of this fundamental biological process. We recently reported that in the Gram-positive organisms Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, increased production of YpsA resulted in cell division inhibition. In this study, we isolated spontaneous suppressor mutations to uncover critical residues of YpsA and the pathways through which YpsA may exert its function. Using this technique, we were able to isolate four unique intragenic suppressor mutations in ypsA (E55D, P79L, R111P, G132E) that rendered the mutated YpsA non-toxic upon overproduction. We also isolated an extragenic suppressor mutation in yfhS, a gene that encodes a protein of unknown function. Subsequent analysis confirmed that cells lacking yfhS were unable to undergo filamentation in response to YpsA overproduction. We also serendipitously discovered that YfhS may play a role in cell size regulation.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=193 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/946632v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1098d63org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@216f86org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@121050eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d2ef3a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG ABBREVIATED SUMMARYIn Bacillus subtilis, we discovered that increased expression of ypsA results in cell division inhibition and impairment of colony formation on solid medium.

    "abstract": "Lipid droplets (LDs) are increasingly recognized as critical organelles in signalling events, transient protein sequestration and inter-organelle interactions. However, the role LDs play in antiviral innate immune pathways remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that induction of LDs occurs as early as 2 hours post viral infection, is transient, and returns to basal levels by 72 hours. This phenomenon occurred following viral infections, both in vitro and in vivo. Virally driven LD induction was type-I interferon (IFN) independent, however, was dependent on EGFR engagement, offering an alternate mechanism of LD induction in comparison to our traditional understanding of their biogenesis. Additionally, LD induction corresponded with enhanced cellular type-I and -III IFN production in infected cells, with enhanced LD accumulation decreasing viral replication of both HSV-1 and Zika virus (ZIKV). Here, we demonstrate for the first time, that LDs play vital roles in facilitating the magnitude of the early antiviral immune response specifically through the enhanced modulation of IFN following viral infection, and control of viral replication. By identifying LDs as a critical signalling organelle, this data represents a paradigm shift in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms which coordinate an effective antiviral response.",

    "abstract": "Escherichia coli is a commensal of birds and mammals, including humans. It can act as an opportunistic pathogen and is also found in water and sediments. Since most population studies have focused on clinical isolates, we studied the phylogeny, genetic diversification, and habitat-association of 1,294 isolates representative of the phylogenetic diversity of more than 5,000, mostly non-clinical, isolates originating from humans, poultry, wild animals and water sampled from the Australian continent. These strains represent the species diversity and show large variations in gene repertoires within sequence types. Recent gene transfer is driven by mobile elements and determined by habitat sharing and by phylogroup membership, suggesting that gene flow reinforces the association of certain genetic backgrounds with specific habitats. The phylogroups with smallest genomes had the highest rates of gene repertoire diversification and fewer but more diverse mobile genetic elements, suggesting that smaller genomes are associated with higher, not lower, turnover of genetic information. Many of these small genomes were in freshwater isolates suggesting that some lineages are specifically adapted to this environment. Altogether, these data contribute to explain why epidemiological clones tend to emerge from specific phylogenetic groups in the presence of pervasive horizontal gene transfer across the species.",

    "abstract": "Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a common chronic inflammatory disease affecting the oral mucosa. The pathogenesis of OLP is incompletely understood but is thought to be related to the immune system. As the oral cavity is a major reservoir and transmission gateway for bacteria, viruses, and fungi, the microbial composition of the oral cavity could play a role in the pathogenesis of OLP. However, due to limitations of analytic technology and incomplete knowledge of the microbial community in the oral cavity, it is not yet clear which pathogens are associated with OLP. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful tool that can help to identify pathogens for many infectious diseases. In this study, we compared host cell gene expression profiles and microbial profiles from OLP patients and matched healthy individuals. We identified activation of the hepatocyte nuclear factor alpha (HNF4A) network in OLP patients and potential pathogens, including Corynebacterium matruchotii, Fusobacterium periodonticum, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus oralis, and Prevotella denticola. P. denticola is capable of activating the HNF4A gene network. Our findings shed light on the previously elusive association of OLP with various diseases like hepatitis, and indicate that OLP is a T-helper type 17 (Th17)-mediated mucosal inflammatory process. The molecular pathways and microbes identified here can inform future investigations into OLP pathogenesis and development of novel therapeutics for OLP treatment.",

While previous methods often treat the detection of each putative connection as a separate hypothesis test, here we develop a modeling approach that infers synaptic connections while incorporating circuit properties learned from the whole network. We use an extension of the Generalized Linear Model framework to describe the cross-correlograms between pairs of neurons and separate correlograms into two parts: a slowly varying effect due to background fluctuations and a fast, transient effect due to the synapse. We then use the observations from all putative connections in the recording to estimate two network properties: the presynaptic neuron type (excitatory or inhibitory) and the relationship between synaptic latency and distance between neurons. Constraining the presynaptic neurons type, synaptic latencies, and time constants improves synapse detection. In data from simulated networks, this model outperforms two previously developed synapse detection methods, especially on the weak connections. We also apply our model to in vitro multielectrode array recordings from mouse somatosensory cortex. Here our model automatically recovers plausible connections from hundreds of neurons, and the properties of the putative connections are largely consistent with previous research.\n\nNew & NoteworthyDetecting synaptic connections using large-scale extracellular spike recordings is a difficult statistical problem.

    "abstract": "Nonlinear dynamical analysis has been used to quantify the complexity of brain signal at temporal scales. Power law scaling is a well-validated method in physics that has been used to describe the complex nature of a system across different time scales. In this research, we investigated the change of power-law characteristics in a large-scale resting-state fMRI data of schizophrenia (N = 200) and healthy participants (N = 200) derived from Taiwan Aging and Mental Illness cohort. Fourier transform was used to determine the power spectral density (PSD) of resting-state fMRI signal. We estimated the power law scaling of PSD of resting-state fMRI signal by determining the slope of the regression line fitting to the log-log plot of PSD. The power law scaling represents the dynamical properties of resting-state fMRI signal ranging from noisy oscillation (e.g., white noise) to complex fluctuations (e.g., slope approaches -1). Linear regression model was used to assess the statistical difference in power law scaling between schizophrenia and healthy participants. The significant differences in power law scaling were found in six brain regions. Schizophrenia patients has significantly more positive power law scaling (i.e., frequency components become more homogenous) at four brain regions: left precuneus, left medial dorsal nucleus, right inferior frontal gyrus, and right middle temporal gyrus, compared with healthy participants. Additionally, schizophrenia exhibited less positive power law scaling (i.e., frequency components are more dominant at lower frequency range) in bilateral putamen. Significant correlations of power law scaling with the severity of psychosis were found in these identified brain areas in schizophrenia. These findings suggest that schizophrenia has abnormal brain signal complexity toward random patterns, which is linked to psychotic symptoms. The power law scaling analysis may serve as a novel functional brain imaging marker for evaluating patients with mental illness.",

We compared brain activation and connectivity in relevant networks when viewing images of others bodies and tested their relationships with clinical symptoms and subjective appearance evaluations. We acquired fMRI data from 64 unmedicated females (20 weight-restored AN, 23 BDD, 21 controls) during a matching task using photos of others bodies that were unaltered or spatial-frequency filtered. With general linear model and independent components analyses we compared brain activation and connectivity in visual, striatal, and parietal networks and performed univariate and partial least squares multivariate analyses to investigate relationships with clinical symptoms and appearance evaluations. BDD but not AN demonstrated hypoactivity in dorsal visual and parietal networks compared to controls. Yet, AN and BDD showed partially overlapping patterns of hyperconnectivity in the dorsal visual network and hypoconnectivity in parietal network compared with controls. Further, there were significant activity and connectivity differences between AN and BDD in both networks. In both groups, activity and/or connectivity were associated with symptom severity and appearance ratings of others bodies. AN and BDD demonstrate both distinct and partially overlapping aberrant neural phenotypes involved in body processing and visually encoding global features. Nevertheless, in each disorder, aberrant activity and connectivity show relationships to clinically relevant symptoms and subjective perception.

    "abstract": "The current paradigm is that inflammatory pain passively resolves following the cessation of inflammation. Yet, in a substantial proportion of patients with inflammatory diseases, resolution of inflammation is not sufficient to resolve pain, resulting in chronic pain. Mechanistic insight how inflammatory pain is resolved is lacking. Here we show that macrophages actively control resolution of inflammatory pain remotely from the site of inflammation by transferring mitochondria to sensory neurons. During resolution of inflammatory pain in mice, M2-like macrophages infiltrate the dorsal root ganglia that contain the somata of sensory neurons, concurrent with the recovery of oxidative phosphorylation in sensory neurons. The resolution of pain and the transfer of mitochondria requires expression of CD200 Receptor (CD200R) on macrophages and the non-canonical CD200R-ligand iSec1 on sensory neurons. Our data reveal a novel mechanism for active resolution of inflammatory pain.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=172 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/940445v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (36K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1048f6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1262306org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c58261org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f2d4a0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The impact of development and healthy aging on spatial cognition has been traditionally attributed to a difficulty in using allocentric strategies and a preference for egocentric ones. An alternative possibility, suggested by our previous works, is that this preference is actually conditioned by the spatial cues (e.g. geometric of landmark cues) present in the environment rather than a strategic choice per se. We tested this prediction by having 79 subjects (children, young and older adults) navigating a Y-maze composed either of landmarks or geometric cues, with an immersive head-mounted display that allows us to record both head and eye movements. Our results show that when the performance is based on landmarks solely, children and older adults exhibit a deficit in using allocentric strategies when compared to young adults. Hence, an inverted U-profile of allocentric strategies was observed across the lifespan. This was not due to a default of attention to the landmarks, as evidenced by analysis of gaze dynamics. When geometric were provided, however, older adults and children used allocentric strategies in the same proportion as young adults. They were, in addition, as efficient and quick to implement the strategy. We thus propose a reinterpretation of the previous data in the literature, whereby reference to geometric cues is the default mode for spatial representations, which is immune to age, whereas spatial representations fail to be anchored on landmarks early in development and later in aging. This new interpretation has the potential to reunify several data from the literature, ranging from spatial cues processing to strategy preference, and including other spatial skills like path integration and route learning.",

Well-documented examples from plants are, however, still rare, as are inquiries of mechanisms driving convergence in some traits while divergence in others. Arabidopsis arenosa, a predominantly foothill species with scattered morphologically distinct alpine occurrences is a promising candidate. Yet, the hypothesis of parallelism remained untested. We sampled foothill and alpine populations in all regions known to harbour the alpine ecotype and used SNP genotyping to test for repeated alpine colonisation. Then, we combined field surveys and a common garden experiment to quantify phenotypic parallelism. Genetic clustering by region but not elevation and coalescent simulations demonstrated parallel origin of alpine ecotype in four mountain regions. Alpine populations exhibited parallelism in height and floral traits which persisted after two generations in cultivation. In contrast, leaf traits were distinctive only in certain region(s), reflecting a mixture of plasticity and genetically determined non-parallelism. We demonstrate varying degrees and causes of parallelism and non-parallelism across populations and traits within a plant species. Parallel divergence along a sharp elevation gradient makes A. arenosa a promising candidate for studying genomic basis of adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Bromodomain-containing proteins are often part of chromatin-modifying complexes, and their activity can lead to altered expression of genes that drive cancer, inflammation and neurological disorders in humans. Bromodomain-PHD finger protein 1 (BRPF1) is part of the MOZ (monocytic leukemic zinc-finger protein) HAT (histone acetyltransferase) complex, which is associated with chromosomal translocations known to contribute to the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). BRPF1 contains a unique combination of chromatin reader domains including two plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers separated by a zinc knuckle (PZP domain), a bromodomain, and a proline-tryptophan-tryptophan-proline (PWWP) domain. BRPF1 is known to recruit the MOZ HAT complex to chromatin by recognizing acetylated lysine residues on the N-terminal histone tail region through its bromodomain. However, histone proteins can contain several acetylation modifications on their N-terminus, and it is unknown how additional marks influence bromodomain recruitment to chromatin. Here, we identify the BRPF1 bromodomain as a selective reader of di-acetyllysine modifications on histone H4. We used ITC assays to characterize the binding of di-acetylated histone ligands to the BRPF1 bromodomain and found that the domain binds preferentially to histone peptides H4K5acK8ac and H4K5acK12ac. Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) experiments revealed that the monomeric state of the BRPF1 bromodomain coordinates di-acetylated histone ligands. NMR chemical shift perturbation studies, along with binding and mutational analyses, revealed non-canonical regions of the bromodomain-binding pocket that are important for histone tail recognition. Together, our findings provide critical information on how the combinatorial action of post-translational modifications can modulate BRPF1 bromodomain binding and specificity.",

    "abstract": "MotivationAccurately determining the atomic structure of proteins represents a fundamental problem in the field of structural bioinformatics. A solution would be significant as protein structure information could be utilized in the medical field, e.g. in the development of vaccines for new viruses. This paper focuses on predicting the protein structure based on 3D images of the proteins captured through cryogenic electron microscopes (cryo-EM). A fully automated computationally efficient protein structure prediction method would be particularly beneficial in the field of cryo-EM as the technology allows researchers to photograph multiple large protein complexes in a single study, which means that a fast prediction method could allow for a high throughput of derived protein structures. We present a deep learning approach, DeepTracer, for predicting locations of the backbone atoms, secondary structure elements, and the amino acid types. In order to connect the predicted amino acids into chains, we applied a modified traveling salesman algorithm.\n\nResultsWe trained our deep learning model on experimental cryo-EM density maps and tested it on a set of 50 density maps. We found that our new approach predicted protein structures with an average RMSD value of 1.18 and a coverage of 87.5%. Furthermore, we detected secondary structure information for 87.2% of amino acids correctly. We also showed preliminarily that 25.2% of amino acid types could be predicted directly from the 3D cryo-EM density map, considering 20 different types in total. Finally, we noted that the prediction runtime of DeepTracer is significantly improved compared to other methods. It predicts a large protein complex structure of more than 30,000 amino acids in only 2 hours.\n\nAvailabilityThe repository of this project will be published.\n\nContactdongsi@uw.edu\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data will be available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "Recent recurrent outbreaks of Gram-negative bacteria show the critical need to target essential bacterial mechanisms to fight the increase of antibiotic resistance. Pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria have developed several strategies to protect themselves against the host immune response and antibiotics. One strategy is to remodel the outer membrane where several genes are involved. yejM was discovered as an essential gene in E. coli and S. typhimurium that plays a critical role in their virulence by changing the outer membrane permeability by translocating and increasing the cardiolipin lipid concentration. How the inner membrane protein YejM with its periplasmic domain acts as a cardiolipin translocator remains unknown. Despite overwhelming structural similarity of the periplasmic domains of two YejM homologues with hydrolases like arylsulfatases, no enzymatic activity has been reported for YejM. Our studies reveal an intact active site with bound metal ions in the structure of YejM periplasmic domain. Furthermore, we show that YejM has a phosphatase activity that is dependent on the presence of magnesium ions and is linked to its cardiolipin translocation properties. Understanding the molecular mechanism by which YejM is involved in OM remodeling will help to identify a new drug target in the fight against the increased antibiotic resistance.",

    "abstract": "Genotype-based diagnostics for antibiotic resistance represent a promising alternative to empiric therapy, reducing inappropriate and ineffective antibiotic use. However, because such assays infer resistance phenotypes based on the presence or absence of known genetic markers, their utility will wane in response to the emergence of novel resistance. Maintenance of these diagnostics will therefore require surveillance designed to ensure early detection of novel resistance variants, but efficient strategies to do so remain to be defined. Here, we evaluate the efficiency of targeted sampling approaches informed by patient and pathogen characteristics in detecting genetic variants associated with antibiotic resistance or diagnostic escape in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, focusing on this pathogen because of its high burden of disease, the imminent threat of treatment resistance, and the use and ongoing development of genotype-based diagnostics. We show that incorporating patient characteristics, such as demographics, geographic regions, or anatomical sites of isolate collection, into sampling approaches is not a reliable strategy for increasing variant detection efficiency. In contrast, sampling approaches informed by pathogen characteristics, such as genomic diversity and genomic background, are significantly more efficient than random sampling in identifying genetic variants associated with antibiotic resistance and diagnostic escape.",

    "abstract": "Manuka honey has broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and unlike traditional antibiotics, resistance to its killing effects has not been reported. However, its mechanism of action remains unclear. Here we investigated the mechanism of action of manuka honey and its key antibacterial components using a transcriptomic approach in a model organism, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We show that no single component of honey can account for its total antimicrobial action, and that honey affects the expression of genes in the SOS response, oxidative damage and quorum sensing. Manuka honey uniquely affects genes involved in the explosive cell lysis process and in maintaining the electron transport chain, causing protons to leak across membranes and collapsing the proton motive force; and induces membrane depolarisation and permeabilisation in P. aeruginosa. These data indicate that the activity of manuka honey comes from multiple mechanisms of action that do not engender bacterial resistance.\n\nImportanceThe threat of antimicrobial resistance to human health has prompted interest in complex, natural products with antimicrobial activity. Honey has been an effective topical wound treatment throughout history, predominantly due to its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. Unlike traditional antibiotics, honey-resistant bacteria have not been reported, however, honey remains underutilised in the clinic in part due to a lack of understanding of its mechanism of action. Here we demonstrate that honey affects multiple processes in bacteria, and this is not explained by its major antibacterial components. Honey also uniquely affects bacterial membranes and this can be exploited for combination therapy with antibiotics that are otherwise ineffective on their own. We argue that honey should be included as part of the current array of wound treatments due to its effective antibacterial activity that does not promote resistance in bacteria.",

Here, we focus on changes in the behavioral state of Drosophila females that persist for minutes following optogenetic activation of a single class of central brain neurons termed pC1. We find that female pC1 neurons drive a variety of persistent behaviors in the presence of males, including increased receptivity, shoving, and chasing. By reconstructing cells in a volume electron microscopic image of the female brain, we classify 7 different pC1 cell types and, using cell type specific driver lines, determine that one of these, pC1-Alpha, is responsible for driving persistent female shoving and chasing. Using calcium imaging, we locate sites of minutes-long persistent neural activity in the brain, which include pC1 neurons themselves. Finally, we exhaustively reconstruct all synaptic partners of a single pC1-Alpha neuron, and find recurrent connectivity that could support the persistent neural activity. Our work thus links minutes-long persistent changes in behavior with persistent neural activity and recurrent circuit architecture in the female brain.",

    "abstract": "Evidence-based conservation relies on robust and relevant evidence. Practitioners often prefer locally relevant studies whose results are more likely to be transferable to the context of planned conservation interventions. To quantify the availability of relevant evidence for amphibian and bird conservation we reviewed Conservation Evidence, a database of quantitative tests of conservation interventions. Studies were geographically clustered and found at extremely low densities - fewer than one study was present within a 2,000 km radius of a given location. The availability of relevant evidence was extremely low when we restricted studies to those studying biomes or taxonomic orders containing high percentages of threatened species, compared to the most frequently studied biomes and taxonomic orders. Further constraining the evidence by study design showed that only 17-20% of amphibian and bird studies used robust designs. Our results highlight the paucity of evidence on the effectiveness of conservation interventions, and the disparity in evidence for local contexts that are frequently studied and those where conservation needs are greatest. Addressing the serious global shortfall in context-specific evidence requires a step change in the frequency of testing conservation interventions, greater use of robust study designs and standardized metrics, and methodological advances to analyze patchy evidence bases.",

    "abstract": "Functional characterisation of cell-type specific regulatory networks is key to establish a causal link between genetic variation and phenotype. The osteoclast offers a unique model for interrogating the contribution of co-regulated genes to in vivo phenotype as its multinucleation and resorption activities determine quantifiable skeletal traits. Here we took advantage of a trans-regulated gene network (MMnet, macrophage multinucleation network) which we found to be significantly enriched for GWAS variants associated with bone-related phenotypes. We found that the network hub gene Bcat1 and seven other co-regulated MMnet genes out of 13, regulate bone function. Specifically, global (Pik3cb-/-, Atp8b2+/-, Igsf8-/-, Eml1-/-, Appl2-/-, Deptor-/-) and myeloid-specific Slc40a1{Delta}LysMCre knockout mice displayed abnormal bone phenotypes. We report antagonizing effects of MMnet genes on bone mass in mice and osteoclast multinucleation/resorption in humans with strong correlation between the two. These results identify MMnet as a functionally conserved network that regulates osteoclast fusion and bone mass.\n\nImpact statementWe took advantage of the osteoclast whose multinucleation properties correlate with bone mass. We show that a trans-regulated gene network (MMnet) controls skeletal homeostasis through osteoclast multinucleation and function.",

    "abstract": "Several unique properties of echinoids (sea urchins) make them useful for exploring macroevolutionary dynamics, including their remarkable fossil record that can be incorporated into explicit phylogenetic hypotheses. However, this potential cannot be exploited without a robust resolution of the echinoid tree of life. We revisit the phylogeny of crown group Echinoidea using both the largest phylogenomic dataset compiled for the clade, as well as a large-scale morphological matrix with a dense fossil sampling. We also gather a new compendium of both tip and node age constraints, allowing us to combine phylogenomic, morphological and stratigraphic data using a total-evidence dating approach. For this, we develop a novel method for subsampling phylogenomic datasets that selects loci with high phylogenetic signal, low systematic biases and enhanced clock-like behavior. Our approach restructure much of the higher-level phylogeny of echinoids, and demonstrates that combining different data sources increases topological accuracy. We are able to resolve multiple alleged conflicts between molecular and morphological datasets, such as the position of Echinothurioida and Echinoneoida, as well as unravelling the relationships between sand dollars and their closest relatives. We then use this topology to trace the evolutionary history of echinoid body size through more than 270 million years, revealing a complex pattern of convergent evolution to stable peaks in macroevolutionary adaptive landscape. Our efforts show how combining phylogenomic and paleontological evidence offers new ways of exploring evolutionary forces operating across deep timescales.",

    "abstract": "We have developed a computational approach to simultaneous genome-wide inference of key population genetics parameters: selection strengths, mutation rates rescaled by the effective population size and the fraction of viable genotypes, solely from an alignment of genomic sequences sampled from the same population. Our approach is based on a generalization of the Ewens sampling formula, used to compute steady-state probabilities of allelic counts in a neutrally evolving population, to populations subjected to selective constraints. Patterns of polymorphisms observed in alignments of genomic sequences are used as input to Approximate Bayesian Computation, which employs the generalized Ewens sampling formula to infer the distributions of population genetics parameters. After carrying out extensive validation of our approach on synthetic data, we have applied it to the evolution of the Drosophila melanogaster genome, where an alignment of 197 genomic sequences is available for a single ancestral-range population from Zambia, Africa. We have divided the Drosophila genome into 100-bp windows and assumed that sequences in each window can exist in either low- or high-fitness state. Thus, the steady-state population in our model is subject to a constant influx of deleterious mutations, which shape the observed frequencies of allelic counts in each window. Our approach, which focuses on deleterious mutations and accounts for intra-window linkage and epistasis, provides an alternative description of background selection. We find that most of the Drosophila genome evolves under selective constraints imposed by deleterious mutations. These constraints are not confined to known functional regions of the genome such as coding sequences and may reflect global biological processes such as the necessity to maintain chromatin structure. Furthermore, we find that inference of mutation rates in the presence of selection leads to mutation rate estimates that are several-fold higher than neutral estimates widely used in the literature. Our computational pipeline can be used in any organism for which a sample of genomic sequences from the same population is available.",

    "abstract": "Aedes albopictus, along with Ae. aegypti, are key arbovirus vectors that have been expanding their geographic range over the last decades. In 2017, Ae. albopictus was detected for the first time at two distinct locations in Portugal. In order to understand how the Ae. albopictus populations recently introduced in Portugal are genetically related and which is their likely route of invasion, we performed an integrative cytochrome C oxidase I gene (COI)- and mitogenome-based phylogeographic analysis of mosquitoes samples collected in Portugal in 2017 and 2018 in the context of the global Ae. albopictus diversity. COI-based analysis (31 partial sequences obtained from 83 mosquitoes) revealed five haplotypes (1 to 5), with haplotype 1 (which is widely distributed in temperate areas worldwide) being detected in both locations. Haplotypes 2 and 3 were exclusively found in Southern region (Algarve), while haplotype 4 and 5 were only detected in the North of Portugal (Penafiel, Oporto region). Subsequent high discriminatory analyses based on Ae. albopictus mitogenome (17 novel sequences) not only confirmed a high degree of genetic variability within and between populations at both geographic locations (compatible with the Ae. albopictus mosquito populations circulating in Europe), but also revealed two mitogenome mutational signatures not previously reported at worldwide level. While our results generally sustain the occurrence of multiple introduction events, fine mitogenome sequence inspection further indicates a possible Ae. albopictus migration within the country, from the Northern introduction locality to the Southern region. In summary, the observed scenario of high Ae. albopictus genetic diversity in Portugal, together with the detection of mosquitoes in successive years since 2017 in Algarve and Penafiel, points that both Ae. albopictus populations seem to be already locally establish, as its presence has been reported for three consecutive years, raising the public health awareness for future mosquito-borne diseases outbreaks.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn 2017, Aedes albopictus was reported for the first time in Portugal at two distinct locations, in the premises of a tyre company in Penafiel, in the North, and nearby a golf course in Algarve, a tourism destination in the southernmost country region. The geographical spread of this species is boosted by larvae and desiccation-resistant eggs transport in aquatic trade goods, as tires and aquatic plants, and adult anthropophilic behavior that favors passive land transportation. In Portugal, especially in the Southern region, temperate climate conditions are adequate for adult mosquitoes survival most of the year. In a way to understand the genetic variability of Ae. albopictus populations introduced in Portugal, we analyzed 31 cytochrome C oxidase I gene (COI) partial sequences and 17 mitogenome sequences, integrating them in the context of the global Ae. albopictus phylogeographic diversity (i.e., 183 COI and 26 mitogenome sequences previously reported at worldwide level). Although COI haplotype 1 predominated, four additional haplotypes (2 to 5) were detected in Portugal. Subsequent in-depth mitogenome analysis revealed considerable genetic diversity, including not only sequences relating to mitogenomes reported mainly from Italy, Japan and China, but also two novel mitogenome mutational signatures.\n\nOur study indicate that Ae. albopictus is locally established in Portugal and intra-country dispersal may have already happened, highlighting the challenges for vector surveillance and control programs aiming at restraining arbovirus disease burden in the future.",

    "abstract": "Host-virus arms races are inherently asymmetric; viruses evolve much more rapidly than host genomes. Thus, there is high interest in discovering mechanisms by which host genomes keep pace with rapidly evolving viruses. One family of restriction factors, the APOBEC3 (A3) cytidine deaminases, has undergone positive selection and expansion via segmental gene duplication and recombination. Here, we show that new copies of A3 genes have also been created in primates by reverse transcriptase-encoding elements like LINE-1 or endogenous retroviruses via a process termed retrocopying. First, we discovered that all simian primate genomes retain the remnants of an ancient A3 retrocopy: A3I. Furthermore, we found that some New World monkeys encode up to ten additional APOBEC3G (A3G) retrocopies. Some of these A3G retrocopies are transcribed in a variety of tissues and able to restrict retroviruses. Our findings suggest that host genomes co-opt retroelement activity in the germline to create new host restriction factors as another means to keep pace with the rapid evolution of viruses. (163)",

Unfortunately, these intrinsically non-numerical datasets are often highly contaminated, and the possible sources of contamination are usually poorly characterized. This contrasts with numerical datasets where Gaussian-type noise is often well-justified. To overcome this hurdle, we introduce the notion of latent weight, which measures the largest expected fraction of samples from a contaminated probabilistic source that conform to a model in a well-structured class of desired models. We examine various properties of latent weights, which we specialize to the class of exchangeable probability distributions. As proof of concept, we analyze DNA methylation data from the 22 human autosome pairs. Contrary to what it is usually assumed, we provide strong evidence that highly specific methylation patterns are overrepresented at some genomic locations when contamination is taken into account.",

Included, the DPANN superphylum archaea, which are massive radiation of organisms, distribute widely in hydrothermal environment, but their metabolism and ecology remain largely unknown. In this study, we assembled 20 DPANN genomes comprised in 43 reconstructed genomes from deep-sea hydrothermal sediments, presenting high abundance in the archaea kingdom. Phylogenetic analysis shows 6 phyla comprising Aenigmarchaeota, Diapherotrites, Nanoarchaeota, Pacearchaeota, Woesearchaeota and a new candidate phylum designated DPANN-HV-2 are included in the 20 DPANN archaeal members, indicating their wide diversity in this extreme environment. Metabolic analysis presents their metabolic deficiencies because of their reduced genome size, such as gluconeogenesis, de novo nucleotide and amino acid synthesis. However, they possess alternative and economical strategies to fill this gap. Furthermore, they were detected to have multiple capacities of assimilating carbon dioxide, nitrogen and sulfur compounds, suggesting their potentially important ecologic roles in the hydrothermal system.\n\nIMPORTANCEDPANN archaea show high distribution in the hydrothermal system. However, they possess small genome size and some incomplete biological process. Exploring their metabolism is helpful to know how such small lives adapt to this special environment and what ecological roles they play. It was ever rarely noticed and reported. Therefore, in this study, we provide some genomic information about that and find their various abilities and potential ecological roles. Understanding their lifestyles is helpful for further cultivating, exploring deep-sea dark matters and revealing microbial biogeochemical cycles in this extreme environment.",

The coordination of these cycles remains mysterious due to poor quantification of TFP dynamics. Here we fluorescently label the TFP in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and track the full extension and retraction cycles of individual TFP to quantify their dynamics. We test several models for the switch between extension and retraction using quantitative experiments, biophysical modeling and genetics. We invalidate the prominent hypothesis that this switch is triggered by surface contact. Instead, we show that the entire repetitive cycle of extension and retraction of individual TFP is governed by the stochastic binding of antagonistic extension and retraction motors and explain how this mechanism quantitatively defines physiologically-important features like TFP length and their production rate. Interestingly, our results suggest that the major throttle of TFP production is the unbinding of the retraction motor.",

In the soil bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens, RimK modifies the C-terminus of ribosomal protein RpsF to influence important aspects of rhizosphere colonisation through proteome remodelling. In this study, we show that RimK activity is itself under complex, multifactorial control by the co-transcribed phosphodiesterase trigger enzyme (RimA) and a polyglutamate-specific protease (RimB). Furthermore, biochemical experimentation and mathematical modelling reveal a role for the nucleotide second messenger cyclic-di-GMP in coordinating these activities. Active ribosome regulation by RimK occurs by two main routes: indirectly, through changes in the abundance of the global translational regulator Hfq and directly, with translation of surface attachment factors, amino acid transporters and key secreted molecules linked specifically to RpsF modification. Our findings show that post-translational ribosomal modification functions as a rapid-response mechanism that tunes global gene translation in response to environmental signals.",

    "abstract": "Dopaminergic modulation is essential for the control of voluntary movement, however the role of dopamine in regulating the neural excitability of the primary motor cortex (M1) is not well understood. Here, we investigated two modes by which dopamine influences the input/output function of M1 neurons. To test the direct regulation of M1 neurons by dopamine, we performed whole-cell recordings of excitatory neurons and measured excitability before and after local, acute dopamine receptor blockade. We then determined if chronic depletion of dopaminergic input to the entire motor circuit, through a mouse model of Parkinsons Disease, was sufficient to shift M1 neuron excitability. We show that D1 and D2 receptor (D1R, D2R) antagonism altered subthreshold and suprathreshold properties of M1 pyramidal neurons in a layer-specific fashion. The effects of D1R antagonism were primarily driven by changes to intrinsic properties, while the excitability shifts following D2R antagonism relied on synaptic transmission.\n\nIn contrast, chronic depletion of dopamine to the motor circuit with 6-hydroxydopamine (6OHDA) induced layer-specific synaptic transmission-dependent shifts in M1 neuron excitability that only partially overlapped with the effects of acute D1R antagonism. These results suggest that while acute and chronic changes in dopamine modulate the input/output function of M1 neurons, the mechanisms engaged are distinct depending on the duration and location of the manipulation. Our study highlights dopamines broad influence on M1 excitability by demonstrating the consequences of local and global dopamine depletion on neuronal input/output function.\n\nSignificance statementDopaminergic signaling is crucial for the control of voluntary movement, and loss of dopaminergic transmission in the motor circuit is thought to underlie motor symptoms in those with Parkinsons Disease (PD). Studies in animal models of PD highlight changes in M1 activity following dopamine depletion, however the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain poorly understood. Here we show that diminished dopamine signaling significantly alters the excitability and input/output function of M1 pyramidal neurons. The effects differed depending on the mode and location - local versus across the motor pathway - of the dopamine manipulation. Our results demonstrate how loss of dopamine can engage complex mechanisms to alter M1 neurons activity.",

    "abstract": "A growing body of evidence demonstrates visual, perceptual, and oculomotor abilities contribute to batting performance in baseball and there is interest in whether training such abilities can transfer positively to batting performance. The current study tested this question through a pre-registered randomized, and placebo-controlled intervention, conducted with 24 collegiate baseball players at two Division 1 universities. Athletes were randomized to receive either dynamic vision training consisting of stroboscopic, anticipatory timing, and eye quickness drills, or placebo drills stylized after control procedures in previous vision therapy studies. Generalized near-transfer was tested via a digital visual-motor task battery (n = 20), while sports-specific intermediate and far transfer of training were evaluated through instrumented batting practice metrics (n = 14) and box score performance in NCAA-sanctioned games (n = 12). The effects of training group were tested on these outcome measures while controlling for covariates such as pre-training expectations and site. Participants averaged 8.50 hours of training with no significant training group differences in adherence, expectations, or baseline assessments. ANCOVA revealed no group differences in measures of visual-motor skills or NCAA game statistics. However, batting practice demonstrated significant improvements in launch angle (p = 0.002, Cohens d = 0.74) and hit distance (p < 0.001, Cohens d = 0.70) for the active cohort relative to the placebo control. This controlled and pre-registered pilot study therefore provides preliminary evidence that vision training may improve batting practice performance, creating new opportunities for the transfer of skill training and warranting further study.\n\nPre-RegistrationAt Open Science Framework on August 9, 2018.

    "abstract": "One important neural hallmark of working memory is persistent elevated delay-period activity in frontal and parietal cortex. In human fMRI, delay-period BOLD activity in frontal and parietal cortex increases monotonically with memory load and asymptotes at an individuals capacity. Previous work has demonstrated that frontal and parietal delay-period activity correlates with the decline in behavioral memory precision observed with increasing memory load. However, because memory precision can be influenced by a variety of factors, it remains unclear what cognitive processes underlie persistent activity in frontal and parietal cortex. Recent psychophysical work has shown that attractor dynamics bias memory representations toward a few stable representations and reduce the effects of internal noise. From this perspective, imprecision in memory results from both drift towards stable attractor states and random diffusion. Here we asked whether delay-period BOLD activity in frontal and parietal cortex might be explained, in part, by these attractor dynamics. We analyzed data from an existing experiment in which subjects performed delayed recall for line orientation, at different loads, during fMRI scanning. We modeled subjects behavior using a discrete attractor model, and calculated within-subject correlation between frontal and parietal delay-period activity and estimated sources of memory error (drift and diffusion). We found that although increases in frontal and parietal activity were associated with increases in both diffusion and drift, diffusion explained the most variance in frontal and parietal delay-period activity. In comparison, a subsequent whole-brain regression analysis showed that drift rather than diffusion explained the most variance in delay-period activity in lateral occipital cortex. These results provide a new interpretation for the function of frontal, parietal, and occipital delay-period activity in working memory.",

Yet no studies have included samples from throughout the pan-tropical range of Ceratopteris or utilized genomic sequencing, making it difficult to assess the full extent of cryptic variation within this genus. Here, we present the first multilocus phylogeny of the genus using reduced representation genomic sequencing (RADseq) and examine population structure, phylogenetic relationships, and ploidy level variation. We recover similar species relationships found in previous studies, find support for a named cryptic species as genetically distinct, and identify a novel putative species from within C. thalictroides sensu latu in Central and South America.",

    "abstract": "Onion (Allium. cepa L), garlic (A. sativum L.), and other members of the Allium genus produce volatile antimicrobial thiosulfinates upon cellular damage. Allicin has been known since the 1950s as the primary antimicrobial thiosulfinate compound and odorant produced by garlic. However, the roles of endogenous thiosulfinate production in host-bacterial pathogen interactions have not been described. The bacterial onion pathogen Pantoea ananatis, which lacks both the virulence Type III and Type II Secretion Systems, induces necrotic symptoms and extensive cell death in onion tissues dependent on a proposed secondary metabolite synthesis chromosomal gene cluster. We found strong correlation between the genetic requirements for P. ananatis to colonize necrotized onion tissue and its capacity for tolerance to the thiosulfinate allicin based on the presence of an eleven gene, plasmid-borne, virulence cluster of sulfur/redox genes. We have designated them  alt genes for allicin tolerance. We show that allicin and onion thiosulfinates restrict bacterial growth with similar kinetics. The alt gene cluster is sufficient to confer allicin tolerance and protects the glutathione pool during allicin treatment. Independent alt genes make partial phenotypic contributions indicating that they function as a collective cohort to manage thiol stress. Our work implicates endogenous onion thiosulfinates produced during cellular damage as mediators of interactions with bacteria. The P. ananatis-onion pathosystem can be modeled as a chemical arms race of pathogen attack, host chemical counter-attack, and pathogen resistance.\n\nSignificance StatementAlliums (e.g. onion and garlic), after sustaining cellular damage, produce potent antimicrobial thiosulfinates that react with cellular thiols. The bacterial onion pathogen Pantoea ananatis, which lacks the virulence Type III and Type II Secretion Systems, induces cell death and necrotic symptoms on onions. We have identified a plasmid-borne cluster of sulfur/redox virulence genes that 1) are required for P. ananatis to colonize necrotized onion tissue, 2) are sufficient for tolerance to the thiosulfinates, and, 3) protect the glutathione pool during thiosulfinate treatment. We propose that the thiosulfinate production potential of Allium spp. governs Allium-bacterial interaction outcomes and that the P. ananatis-onion pathosystem can be modeled as a chemical arms race of attack and counterattack between the pathogen and host.",

    "abstract": "Plants need to attune stress responses to the ongoing developmental programs to maximize their efficacy. For instance, successful submergence adaptation is often associated to a delicate poise between saving resources and their expenditure to activate measures that allow stress avoidance or attenuation. We observed a significant decrease in submergence tolerance associated with aging in Arabidopsis thaliana, with a critical step between two and three weeks of post-germination development. This sensitization to flooding was concomitant with the transition from juvenility to adulthood. Transcriptomic analyses indicated that a group of genes related to ABA and oxidative stress response was more expressed in juvenile plants than in adult ones. These genes are induced by endomembrane tethered ANAC factors that were in turn activated by submergence-associated oxidative stress. A combination of molecular, biochemical and genetic analyses showed that these genes are located in genomic regions that move towards a heterochromatic state with adulthood, as marked by lysine 4 dimethylation of histone H3. We concluded that, while the mechanism of flooding stress perception and signal transduction were unaltered between juvenile and adult phases, the sensitivity that these mechanisms set into action is integrated, via epigenetic regulation, into the developmental programme of the plant.",

    "abstract": "In Elkhorn Slough, a tidal estuary draining into Monterey Bay, California, the intertidal is occupied by a conspicuous orange sponge known by the name Hymeniacidon sinapium. This same species is found in the rocky intertidal zone of the outer coast of California, and is described herein from subtidal kelp forests of Southern California. Farther afield, morphologically and ecologically indistinguishable sponges are common in estuaries and intertidal areas in Asia, Europe, South America, and Africa. Here I use morphological, ecological, and genetic data to show that these sponges are all members of the same globally-distributed species, which should be known by the senior synonym H. perlevis. Though previous authors have remarked upon the morphological, ecological, and/or genetic similarity of various distant populations, the true scope of this sponge\u2019s distribution appears to be unrecognized or unacknowledged in the literature. Limited larval dispersal, historically documented range expansion, and low genetic variation all support a hypothesis that this sponge has achieved its extraordinary range via human-mediated dispersal, making it the most widely-distributed invasive sponge known to date.Declarations Conflicts of interest/Competing interests: none to declareAvailability of data and material: All raw data is included as supplementary files; georeferenced collection data is available as a supplementary .xls file; genetic data are archived at Genbank; specimen vouchers are archived at the California Academy of Sciences and at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles; specimen photos will be made available as supplementary files, are also archived by the associated museums in GBIF, and are posted as georeferenced data on iNaturalist.org.Code availability: n/aCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The loss of tropical forest cover caused by land-use change is causing a reduction in functional groups, such as trophic guilds. Phyllostomid bats (family Phyllostomidae) are essential in the Neotropics since they occupy up to six trophic guilds, and are pollinators, seed dispersers, and regulators of vertebrate and invertebrate populations. In this study, a series of meta-analyses were performed in order to analyse their response to habitat disturbance. Data were obtained through a comprehensive literature review whereby we measured the abundance of phyllostomid bats in disturbed habitats and conserved forests. We found that the abundance of phytophagous bats depends on the type of habitat disturbance and the type of forest where it occurs. On the other hand, animal-feeding bats reduce their abundance in any disturbed habitat regardless of disturbance type and forest type. No phylogenetic signal was found in the response of bats to habitat disturbance, nor was the response found to be dependent on the type of crop, the age of the secondary forest, or the distance to a conserved forest. These results demonstrate that feeding and the type of forest where the disturbance occurs are important aspects to understand the reduction of animal populations in the face of habitat destruction processes. This has implications on the conservation of species and their function in ecosystems.\n\nHighlightsO_LINo phylogenetic signal was found in the abundance of bats in disturbed habitats.\nC_LIO_LIThe abundance of bats in disturbed habitats depends on the trophic guild.\nC_LIO_LIForest altitude influences the abundance of bats in disturbed habitats.\nC_LIO_LIAnimal-feeding bats reduced their abundance in disturbed habitats regardless of disturbance type and forest type.\nC_LI",

To determine the epidemiology of the newly discovered or emerging viruses we conducted high-throughput RT-PCR to reveal their prevalence in British Columbia (BC), and detected some of the viruses we first discovered in farmed Atlantic salmon in Chinook and sockeye salmon, suggesting a broad host range.

Clarifying the molecular nature of and the factors that regulate extracellular matrix stiffening in tumors should identify biomarkers to stratify patients for therapy and therapeutic interventions to improve outcome. We profiled lysyl hydroxylase- and lysyl oxidase-mediated collagen crosslinks and quantified the greatest abundance of total and complex collagen crosslinks in more aggressive human breast cancer subtypes with the stiffest stroma. These tissues also harbored the highest number of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), whose therapeutic ablation not only reduced metastasis, but also concomitantly decreased accumulation of collagen crosslinks and stromal stiffening. Epithelial-targeted expression of the crosslinking enzyme lysyl oxidase had no impact on collagen crosslinking in PyMT mammary tumors, whereas stromal cell targeting did. Consistently, stromal cells in microdissected human tumors expressed the highest level of collagen crosslinking enzymes. Immunohistochemical analysis of a cohort of breast cancer patient biopsies revealed that stromal expression of lysyl hydroxylase two, an enzyme that induces hydroxylysine aldehyde-derived collagen crosslinks and stromal stiffening correlated significantly disease specific mortality. The findings link tissue inflammation, stromal cell-mediated collagen crosslinking and stiffening to tumor aggression and identify lysyl hydroxylase two as a novel stromal biomarker.\n\nSignificanceWe show infiltrating macrophages induce stromal fibroblast, and not epithelial, expression of collagen crosslinking enzymes that drive tumor stiffening.

    "abstract": "The majority of mosquito-borne illness is spread by a few mosquito species that have evolved to specialize in biting humans, yet the precise causes of this behavioral shift are poorly understood. We address this gap in the arboviral vector Aedes aegypti. We first characterize the behaviour of mosquitoes from 27 sites scattered across the species ancestral range in sub-Saharan Africa, revealing previously unrecognized diversity in female preference for human versus animal odor. We then use modelling to show that this diversity can be almost fully predicted by two ecological factors - dry season intensity and human population density. Finally we integrate this information with whole genome sequence data from 345 individual mosquitoes to identify a single underlying ancestry component linked to human preference, with genetic changes concentrated in a few key chromosomal regions. Our findings strongly suggest that human-biting in this important disease vector originally evolved as a by-product of breeding in human-stored water in areas where doing so provided the only means to survive the long, hot dry season. Our model also predicts that changes in human population density are likely to drive future mosquito evolution. Rapid urbanization may drive a shift to human-biting in many cities across Africa by 2050.",

    "abstract": "RNA splicing, and variations in this process referred to as alternative splicing, are critical aspects of gene regulation in eukaryotes. From environmental responses in plants to being a primary link between genetic variation and disease in humans, splicing differences confer extensive phenotypic changes across diverse organisms1-3. Current approaches for analysing splicing rely on quantifying variant transcripts (i.e., isoforms) or splicing events (i.e., intron retention, exon skipping etc)4, 5. However, regulation of splicing occurs at the level of selection of individual splice sites, which results in variation in the abundance of isoforms and/or splicing events. Here, we present a simple approach to quantify the strength of individual splice sites, which determines their selection in a splicing reaction. Splice-site strength, as a quantitative phenotype, allows us to analyse splicing precisely in unprecedented ways. We demonstrate the power of this approach in defining the genomic determinants of the strength of individual splice-sites through GWAS. Our pilot-GWAS with more than thousand splice sites hints that cis-sequence divergence and competition between splice-sites and are among the primary determinants of variation in splicing among natural accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana. This approach allows deciphering the principles of splicing, which in turn has implications that range from agriculture to medicine.",

Whole brain tissue expression profiles have proved surprisingly uninformative. We applied single cell RNA sequencing to profile a FXS mouse model. We found that FXS results in a highly cell type specific effect and it is strongest among different neuronal types. We detected a downregulation of mRNAs bound by FMRP and this effect is prominent in neurons. Metabolic pathways including translation are significantly upregulated across all cell types with the notable exception of excitatory neurons. These effects point to a potential difference in the activity of mTOR pathways, and together with other dysregulated pathways suggest an excitatory-inhibitory imbalance in the FXS cortex which is exacerbated by astrocytes. Our data demonstrate the cell-type specific complexity of FXS and provide a resource for interrogating the biological basis of this disorder.",

    "abstract": "The natural bioactive glycerophospholipid lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) binds to its cognate G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) on the cell surface to promote the activation of several transcription factors, including NF-{kappa}B. LPA-mediated activation of NF-{kappa}B relies on the formation of a signalosome that contains the scaffold CARMA3, the adaptor BCL10 and the paracaspase MALT1 (CBM complex). The CBM has been extensively studied in lymphocytes, where it links antigen receptors to NF-{kappa}B activation via the recruitment of the linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LUBAC), a tripartite complex of HOIP, HOIL1 and SHARPIN. Moreover, MALT1 cleaves the LUBAC subunit HOIL1 to further enhance NF-{kappa}B activation. However, the contribution of the LUBAC downstream of GPCRs has not been investigated. By using murine embryonic fibroblasts from mice deficient for HOIP, HOIL1 and SHARPIN, we report that the LUBAC is crucial for the activation of NF-{kappa}B in response to LPA. Further echoing the situation in lymphocytes, LPA unbridles the protease activity of MALT1, which cleaves HOIL1 at the Arginine 165. The expression of a MALT1-insensitive version of HOIL1 reveals that this processing is required for the optimal production of the NF-{kappa}B target cytokine interleukin-6. Lastly, we provide evidence that the guanine exchange factor GEF-H1 activated by LPA favors MALT1-mediated cleavage of HOIL1 and NF-{kappa}B signaling. Together, our results unveil a critical role for the LUBAC as a positive regulator of NF-{kappa}B signaling downstream of GPCRs.",

    "abstract": "The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is a well-established target for development of broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics. Incorporation of ribonucleotide analogues by the RdRp will either cause termination of RNA synthesis or mutagenesis of the RNA product. We demonstrated recently that incorporation of a pyrazine-carboxamide ribonucleotide into nascent RNA leads to pausing and backtracking of the elongating RdRp. Here, we provide evidence for the single-stranded RNA product of backtracking serving as an intermediate in RdRp-catalyzed, template-switching reactions. This intermediate is used for both intramolecular template-switching (copy-back RNA synthesis) and intermolecular template-switching (homologous RNA recombination). The use of a magnetic-tweezers platform to monitor RdRp elongation dynamics permitted direct observation of copy-back synthesis and illuminated properties of the RdRp that promote copy-back synthesis, including stability of the RdRp-nascent-RNA complex and the dimensions of the RdRp nucleic-acid-binding channel. In cells, recombination was stimulated by the presence of a pyrazine-carboxamide ribonucleotide. The effect of the drug on recombination was diminished for a recombination-defective virus, but this virus was not resistant to the drug.

    "abstract": "Suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis is a readout for stress-induced alterations in neuroplasticity. In this study, we hypothesized that a single episode of severe social or non-social stress would differentially suppress neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) 10 days later in two rat strains. We anticipated that the suppression following social stress would be less severe in wildtype Groningen (WTG) rats, a rat strain considered relatively resilient to social stressors. Male Wistar and WTG were subjected to either social defeat or to immobilization stress. Behavioral response to social defeat and acute corticosterone response to both stressors was measured as well as anxiety behavior 10 days later on the elevated plus maze. Subsequently, brains were collected following cardiac aldehyde perfusion. The behavioral freezing response to defeat was much stronger in Wistar rats as compared to WTG rats. Acute corticosteroid response was similar in both strains although Wistar rats more rapidly resumed baseline values. There was no significant effect of both stressors on hippocampal DG cell proliferation and differentiation as well as on anxiety behavior. However, a striking strain difference appeared in anxiety behavior and both markers of neurogenesis. The WTG strain exhibiting much lower anxiety as well as reduced rate of hippocampal neurogenesis under all treatments. The results in this study suggest that both short-lasting acute stressors failed to induce lasting anxiety or decreased neurogenesis in the DG. Future studies could explore if and how rate of hippocampal neurogenesis is related with behavioral coping with stress.",

    "abstract": "During exploration, animals form an internal map of an environment by combining information about specific sensory cues or landmarks with the animals motion through space, a process which critically depends on the mammalian hippocampus. The dentate gyrus (DG) is the first stage of the hippocampal trisynaptic circuit where self-motion and sensory cue information are integrated, yet it remains unknown how neurons within the DG encode both cue related (\"what\") and spatial (\"where\") information during cognitive map formation. Using two photon calcium imaging in head fixed mice running on a treadmill, along with on-line sensory cue manipulation at specific track locations, we have identified robust sensory cue responses in DG granule cells largely independent of spatial location. Granule cell cue responses are stable for long periods of time, selective for the modality of the stimulus and accompanied by strong inhibition of the firing of other active neurons. At the same time, there is a smaller fraction of neurons whose firing is spatially tuned but insensitive to the presentation of nearby cues, similar to traditional place cells. These results demonstrate the existence of \"cue cells\" in addition to the better characterized \"place cells\" in the DG, an important heterogeneity that has been previously overlooked. We hypothesize that the granule cell population may support multiple channels of spatial and non-spatial information that contribute distinctly to local and down-stream computations and impact the role of the dentate gyrus in spatial navigation and episodic memory.",

Our objective was to identify the characteristics of lipid droplets (LDs) in ovarian steroidogenic cells. We hypothesized that LDs are a major feature of steroidogenic luteal cells and store cholesteryl esters. Bovine luteal tissue was used for whole tissue analysis. Further analyses were performed on isolated ovarian steroidogenic cells: granulosa and theca cells of the follicle, and small/large luteal cells. Isolated luteal LDs were collected for lipid/protein analyses. Luteal tissue contained perilipins 2/3/5, hormone-sensitive lipase and abhydrolase domain containing 5. Luteal tissue was enriched in TGs compared to other tissues, except of adipose tissue. Large and small luteal cells were distinguished from follicular cells by the presence of LDs and LD-associated proteins. Furthermore, LDs from large luteal cells were numerous and small; whereas, LDs from small luteal cells were large and less numerous. Isolated LDs contained nearly all of the TGs and cholesteryl esters present in luteal tissue. Isolated luteal LDs were composed primarily of TG, with lesser amounts of cholesteryl esters, diglyceride and other phospholipids. Bovine luteal tissue LDs are distinct from LDs in other bovine tissues, including follicular steroidogenic cells.",

    "abstract": "Antibody variable domains contain \"complementarity determining regions\" (CDRs), the loops that form the antigen binding site. CDRs1-3 are recognized as the canonical CDRs. However, a fourth loop sits adjacent to CDR1 and CDR2 and joins the D and E strands on the antibody v-type fold. This \"DE loop\" is usually treated as a framework region, even though mutations in the loop affect the conformation of the CDRs and residues in the DE loop occasionally contact antigen. We analyzed the length, structure, and sequence features of all DE loops in the Protein Data Bank, as well as millions of sequences from HIV-1 infected and naive patients. We refer to the DE loop as H4 and L4 in the heavy and light chain respectively. Clustering the backbone conformations of the most common length of L4 (6 residues) reveals four conformations: two {kappa}-only clusters, one {lambda}-only cluster, and one mixed {kappa}/{lambda} cluster. The vast majority of H4 loops are length-8 and exist primarily in one conformation; a secondary conformation represents a small fraction of H4-8 structures. H4 sequence variability exceeds that of the antibody framework in naive human high-throughput sequences, and both L4 and H4 sequence variability from {lambda} and heavy germline sequences exceed that of germline framework regions. Finally, we identified dozens of structures in the PDB with insertions in the DE loop, all related to broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibodies, as well as antibody sequences from high-throughput sequencing studies of HIV-infected individuals, illuminating a possible role in humoral immunity to HIV-1.",

H2A.Z is deposited by the SWR1 chromatin remodeler and evicted by unclear mechanisms. We tracked H2A.Z in living yeast at single-molecule resolution, and found that H2A.Z eviction is dependent on RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) and the Kin28/Cdk7 kinase, which phosphorylates Serine 5 of heptapeptide repeats on the carboxy-terminal domain of the largest Pol II subunit Rpb1. These findings link H2A.Z eviction to transcription initiation, promoter escape and early elongation activities of Pol II. Because passage of Pol II through +1 nucleosomes genome-wide would obligate H2A.Z turnover, we propose that global transcription of noncoding RNAs prior to premature termination, in addition to transcription of mRNAs, are responsible for eviction of H2A.Z. Such usage of yeast Pol II suggests a general mechanism coupling eukaryotic transcription to erasure of the H2A.Z epigenetic signal.",

    "abstract": "Reconstruction of abdominal wall defects is still a big challenge in surgery, especially where there is insufficient fascia muscular or excessive tension of the defects in emergency and life-threatening scenarios. Indeed, the concept of damage control surgery has been advanced in the management of both traumatic and nontraumatic surgical settings. The strategy requires abridged surgery and quick back to intensive care units (ICU) for aggressive resuscitation. In the damage control laparotomy, patients are left with open abdomen or provisional closure of the abdomen with a planned return to the operating room for definitive surgery. So far, various techniques have been utilized to achieve early temporary abdominal closure, but there is no clear consensus on the ideal method or material for abdominal wall reconstruction. We recently successfully created the selective germline genome-edited pig (SGGEP) and here we aimed to explore the feasibility of in vivo reconstruction of the abdominal wall in a rabbit model with SGGEP meninges grafts (SGGEP-MGs). Our result showed that the SGGEP-MGs could restore the integrity of the defect very well. After 7 weeks of engraftment, there was no sign of herniation observed, the grafts were re-vascularized, and the defects were well repaired. Histologically, the boundary between the graft and the host was very well integrated and there was no strong inflammatory response. Therefore, this kind of closure could help restore the fluid and electrolyte balance and to dampen systemic inflammatory response in damge control surgery while ADM graft failed to establish re-vascularization as the same as the SGGEP-MG. It is concluded that the meninges of SGGEP could serve as a high-quality alternative for restoring the integrity of the abdominal wall, especially for damage control surgery.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial and plastid genomes in land plants exhibit some of the slowest rates of sequence evolution observed in any eukaryotic genome, suggesting an exceptional ability to prevent or correct mutations. However, the mechanisms responsible for this extreme fidelity remain unclear. We tested seven candidate genes involved in cytoplasmic DNA replication, recombination, and repair (POLIA, POLIB, MSH1, RECA3, UNG, FPG, and OGG1) for effects on mutation rates in the model angiosperm Arabidopsis thaliana by applying a highly accurate DNA sequencing technique (duplex sequencing) that can detect newly arisen mitochondrial and plastid mutations still at low heteroplasmic frequencies. We find that disrupting MSH1 (but not the other candidate genes) leads to massive increases in the frequency of point mutations and small indels and changes to the mutation spectrum in mitochondrial and plastid DNA. We also used droplet digital PCR to show transmission of de novo heteroplasmies across generations in msh1 mutants, confirming a contribution to heritable mutation rates. This dual-targeted gene is part of an enigmatic lineage within the mutS mismatch repair family that we find is also present outside of green plants in multiple eukaryotic groups (stramenopiles, alveolates, haptophytes, and cryptomonads), as well as certain bacteria and viruses. MSH1 has previously been shown to limit ectopic recombination in plant cytoplasmic genomes. Our results point to a broader role in recognition and correction of errors in plant mitochondrial and plastid DNA sequence, leading to greatly suppressed mutation rates perhaps via initiation of double-stranded breaks and repair pathways based on faithful homologous recombination.",

Here, we show that the distribution of such correlations depend on the expression level of the involved genes, which we refer to this as a mean-correlation relationship in RNA-seq data, both bulk and single-cell. This dependence introduces a bias in co-expression analysis whereby highly expressed genes are more likely to be highly correlated. Such a relationship is not observed in protein-protein interaction data, suggesting that it is not reflecting biology. Ignoring this bias can lead to missing potentially biologically relevant pairs of genes that are lowly expressed, such as transcription factors. To address this problem, we introduce spatial quantile normalization (SpQN), a method for normalizing local distributions in a correlation matrix. We show that spatial quantile normalization removes the mean-correlation relationship and corrects the expression bias in network reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Artemin is an abundant thermostable protein in Artemia embryos and considered as a highly efficient molecular chaperone against extreme environmental stress conditions. The dynamic conformational properties of artemin appear to play a critical role in its biological activities. In this study, we have investigated the conformational transitions and functional changes of artemin under heat and oxidative stress to find some evidence of the relationship between the structure and function of artemin. The tertiary and quaternary structures of artemin have been evaluated by fluorescence measurements, protein cross-linking analysis, and dynamic light scattering. Based on the structural analysis, artemin showed irreversible substantial conformational lability in response to heat and oxidant which mainly mediated through the hydrophobic interactions and dimerization of the chaperone. In addition, the chaperone-like activity of the heated and oxidized artemin was examined using lysozyme refolding assay and the experiments showed that although both factors, i.e. heat and oxidant, at specific levels improved artemin potency, simultaneous incubation with both stressors significantly triggered the activation of artemin. Moreover, the heat-induced dimerization of artemin was found to be the most critical factor for its activation. It was suggested that oxidation presumably acts through stabilizing the dimer structures of artemin through formation of disulfide bridges between the subunits and strengthens its chaperoning efficacy. Accordingly, it was proposed that artemin probably exists in a monomer-oligomer equilibrium in Artemia cysts and environmental stresses and intracellular portion of protein substrates may shift the equilibrium towards the active dimer forms of the chaperone.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEThere are a number of reports in which the chaperone-like activity of artemin, as a stress protein, has been confirmed in vivo and in vitro. Nonetheless, the details of structural changes of the protein have not been fully discovered yet. In the present work, we focused on conformational properties of artemin from A. urmiana upon exposing to heat and oxidation, by using various structural and functional analysis in order to predict the mechanisms of artemins activation. Notably, this is the first document on reporting the structural transitions of the chaperone in stress conditions.",

TPC contains six evolutionary conserved subunits and two plant specific subunits, AtEH1/Pan1 and AtEH2/Pan1, which are not associated with the hexameric subcomplex in the cytoplasm. To investigate the dynamic assembly of the octameric TPC at the plasma membrane (PM), we performed state-of-the-art dual-color live cell imaging at physiological and a lowered temperature. Our data show that lowering the temperature slows down endocytosis and thereby enhances the temporal resolution of the differential recruitment of endocytic components. Under both normal and lowered temperature conditions, the core TPC subunit TPLATE, and the AtEH/Pan1 proteins, exhibited simultaneous recruitment at the PM. These results, together with our co-localization analysis of different TPC subunits, allow us to conclude that in plant cells, TPC is not recruited to the PM sequentially but as an octameric complex.\n\nOne sentence summaryLowering the temperature increases spatiotemporal resolution of protein recruitment at the plasma membrane.",

Functionally important AGP glycans are synthesized in the Golgi apparatus, but the relationships between their glycosylation, processing, and functionality are poorly understood. Here we report the identification and functional characterization of two Golgi-localized exo-{beta}-1,3-galactosidases from the glycosyl hydrolase 43 (GH43) family in Arabidopsis thaliana. GH43 loss of function mutants exhibit root cell expansion defects in sugar-containing growth media. This root phenotype is associated with an increase in the extent of AGP cell wall association, as demonstrated by Yariv phenylglycoside dye quantification and comprehensive microarray polymer profiling of sequentially extracted cell walls. Recombinant GH43 characterization showed that the exo-{beta}-1,3-galactosidase activity of GH43s is hindered by {beta}-1,6 branches on {beta}-1,3-galactans. In line with this steric hindrance, the recombinant GH43s did not release galactose from cell wall extracted glycoproteins or AGP rich gum arabic. These results show that Arabidopsis GH43s are involved in AGP glycan biosynthesis in the Golgi, and suggest their exo-{beta}-1,3-galactosidase activity influences AGP and cell wall matrix interactions, thereby adjusting cell wall extensibility.",

We show that SSHELs bound to target cells are taken up and trafficked to acidic compartments, whereupon the cargo is released in a pH-dependent manner. Finally, we demonstrate that SHELLs can clear small tumor lesions in a complex tumor microenvironment in a zebrafish model of brain metastasis. We propose that SSHELs represent a versatile strategy for targeted drug delivery.",

    "abstract": "Neurons in various regions of the brain generate spike bursts. While the number of spikes within a burst has been shown to carry information, information coding by interspike intervals (ISIs) is less well understood. In particular, a burst with k spikes has k-1 intraburst ISIs, and these k-1 ISIs could theoretically encode k-1 independent values. In this study, we demonstrate that such combinatorial coding occurs for retinal bursts. By recording ganglion cell spikes from isolated salamander retinae, we found that intraburst ISIs encode oscillatory light sequences that are much faster than the light intensity modulation encoded by the number of spikes. When a burst has three spikes, the two intraburst ISIs combinatorially encode the amplitude and phase of the oscillatory sequence. Analysis of trial-to-trial variability suggested that intraburst ISIs are regulated by two independent mechanisms responding to orthogonal oscillatory components, one of which is common to bursts with different number of spikes. Therefore, the retina encodes multiple stimulus features by exploiting all degrees of freedom of burst spike patterns, i.e., the spike number and multiple intraburst ISIs.\n\nAuthor SummaryNeurons in various regions of the brain generate spike bursts. Bursts are typically composed of a few spikes generated within dozens of milliseconds, and individual bursts are separated by much longer periods of silence ([~]hundreds of milliseconds). Recent evidence indicates that the number of spikes in a burst, the interspike intervals (ISIs), and the overall duration of a burst, as well as the timing of burst onset, encode information. However, it remains unknown whether multiple ISIs within a single burst encode multiple independent information contents. Here we demonstrate that such combinatorial ISI coding occurs for spike bursts in the retina. We recorded ganglion cell spikes from isolated salamander retinae stimulated with computer-generated movies. Visual response analyses indicated that multiple ISIs within a single burst combinatorially encode the phase and amplitude of oscillatory light sequences, which are different from the stimulus feature encoded by the spike number. The result demonstrates that the retina encodes multiple stimulus features by exploiting all degrees of freedom of burst spike patterns, i.e., the spike number and multiple intraburst ISIs. Because synaptic transmission in the visual system is highly sensitive to ISIs, the combinatorial ISI coding must have a major impact on visual information processing.",

This study developed methodologies for performing qPCR  in the field, then engaged with water management and monitoring groups, and tested the method in a real-world implementation study to evaluate the accuracy of CBM using qPCR both quantitatively and qualitatively. This study found high reproducibility between qPCR results performed by non-expert field users and expert laboratory results, suggesting that qPCR as a methodology could be amenable to a CBM program.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the historical extent of biogenic habitats can provide insight into the nature of human impacts and inform restoration and conservation actions. Kelp forests form an important biogenic habitat that responds to natural and human drivers. Global concerns exist about threats to kelp forests, yet long term information is limited and research suggests that trends are geographically distinct. We examined distribution of the bull kelp Nereocystis luetkeana over 145 years in South Puget Sound (SPS), a semi-protected inner basin in a fjord estuary complex in the northeast Pacific Ocean. We synthesized 48 historical and modern Nereocystis surveys and examined presence/absence within 1-km shoreline segments along 452 km of shoreline. Over the last 145 years, Nereocystis has been documented in 26% of the shoreline segments. Its extent decreased 62% basin-wide between the 1870s and 2017, with extreme losses in the two out of three sub-basins (96% in Central and 83% in West). In recent years, almost all Nereocystis occurred in the East sub-basin. In the majority of segments where Nereocystis disappeared, the most recent observation was 4 decades ago, or earlier. Multiple natural and human factors that are known to impact kelp could have contributed to observed patterns, but limited data exist at the spatial and temporal scale of this study. In some areas, recent environmental conditions approached thresholds associated with decreased kelp performance. Longstanding Nereocystis losses occurred exclusively in areas with relatively low current velocities. Remaining Nereocystis predominantly occurred in areas where circulation is stronger. Exceptions to this pattern demonstrate that additional factors outside the scope of this study contributed to trajectories of Nereocystis persistence or loss.",

    "abstract": "Xishuangbanna in the southwestern border of China is located in the upper reaches of the Mekong River between the Indo-China Peninsula and the East Asian continent. It is the largest tropical rain forest and monsoon forest in China. They have an irreplaceable ecological service function and are an important barrier to maintaining the ecological security of the Mekong River transboundary basin of the Lancang River. Based on three sets of remote sensing data (1996, 2003, 2010 and 2016), this study has made an exploration on spatio-temporal changes of Xishuangbanna, and also made an assessment on different ecosystem values of six types of ecosystem in Xishuangbanna based on related theories of ecological economics. Results showed that the values of Xishuangbanna ecosystem services in 1996, 2003, 2010, and 2016 were 70.4014billion yuan, 70.2115 billion yuan, 68.5129 billion yuan and 63.6098 billion yuan, respectively. The total value shows a continuous decreasing trend, reflecting the continuous decline in the ability of the Xishuangbanna ecosystem to provide services to humans. If divided by ecosystem types, forest and rubber were two types that have the greatest proportion of service values. In the perspective of service types, soil formation and protection account for the largest proportion, followed by gas regulation and biodiversity protection. Studying Xishuangbannas ecosystem service values is helpful to explore the sustainable development of resources and economy.\n\nHighlightThis paper used coefficient of sensitivity to determine the dependence of ESV on the change of ecosystem value coefficient over time.\n\nThe total amount of ESV shows a continuous downward trend, indicating that the ecological environment of Xishuangbanna is still severe.\n\nThe temporal-spatial change of ESV was analyzed for two decades.",

    "abstract": "Nongenetic phenotypic variation can either speed up or slow down adaptive evolution. We show that it can speed up evolution in environments in which available carbon and energy sources change over time. To this end, we use an experimentally validated model of Escherichia coli growth on two alternative carbon sources, glucose and acetate. On the superior carbon source (glucose), all cells achieve high growth rates, while on the inferior carbon source (acetate) only a small fraction of the population manages to initiate growth. Consequently, populations experience a bottleneck when the environment changes from the superior to the inferior carbon source. Growth on the inferior carbon source depends on a circuit under the control of a transcription factor that is repressed in the presence of the superior carbon source. We show that noise in the expression of this transcription factor can increase the probability that cells start growing on the inferior carbon source. In doing so, it can decrease the severity of the bottleneck and increase mean population fitness whenever this fitness is low. A modest amount of noise can also enhance the fitness effects of a beneficial allele. It can accelerate the spreading of such an allele, increase its likelihood of going to fixation, and reduce its fixation time. Central to the adaptation-enhancing principle we identify is the ability of noise to mitigate population bottlenecks. Because such bottlenecks are frequent in fluctuating environments, and because fluctuating environments themselves are ubiquitous, this principle may apply to a broad range of environments and organisms.\n\nAuthor summaryIndividuals that grow in the same environment and share the same genes may still differ in their behaviour and their traits. These differences between individuals arise from uncertainty inherent in all biological processes, and they are found in all domains of life. Although this random individual variability is itself short-lived, it still has the potential to shape evolution in the long term. For example, if a population encounters a harsh environment, random (nongenetic) differences between individuals can cause some individuals to cope better with the new environment than others. These rare individuals may give a population an advantage compared to populations with fewer such differences between individuals. Furthermore, if some of these rare individuals carry a beneficial gene variant, the beneficial effect of this gene variant may become amplified, and consequently spread faster in a population with more random variation. Using a realistic model of cell growth, we show that this mechanism not only works in unfavourable environments that are stable, but also in environments that switch back and forth between a favourable and an unfavourable state. Because many natural environments undergo such periodic changes, and because random differences between individuals are ubiquitous, the mechanism we have identified may be widespread in nature.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAntibiotic use as growth promoters for livestock is presumed to be a major contributor to the acquisition of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes in humans, yet data evaluating AMR patterns in the setting of animal exposure are limited to observational studies that do not capture data from prior to livestock introduction.\n\nMethodsWe performed a feasibility study by recruiting a subset of women in a delayed-start randomized controlled trial of small-scale chicken farming in order to examine the prevalence of clinically-relevant AMR genes. Stool samples were obtained at baseline and one year from five intervention women who received chickens at the start of the study, six control women who did not receive chickens until the end of the study, and from chickens provided to the control group at the end of the study. Stool was screened for 87 clinically significant AMR genes using a commercially available qPCR array (Qiagen).\n\nResultsChickens harbored 23 AMR genes from classes also found in humans as well as vancomycin and additional {beta}-lactamase resistance genes. After one year of exposure to chickens, six new AMR genes were detected in controls and seven new AMR genes were detected in the intervention group. Women who had direct contact with the chickens sampled in the study had greater similarities in AMR resistance gene patterns to chickens than those who did not have direct contact with chickens sampled (p = 0.006). There was a trend towards increased similarity in AMR gene patterns with chickens at one year (p = 0.12).\n\nConclusionsChickens and humans in this study harbored AMR genes from many antimicrobial classes at both baseline and follow up timepoints. Studies designed to evaluate human AMR genes in the setting of animal exposure should account for high baseline AMR rates, and consider collecting concomitant animal samples, human samples, and environmental samples over time to determine the directionality and source of AMR genes.\n\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02619227",

Its dysfunction might lead to several brain pathologies, including the Alzheimers disease. A key component of the GS and brain tissue water circulation is the astrocyte which is regulated by acquaporin4 (AQP4), a membrane-bound water channel on the astrocytic end-feet. Here we investigated the potential of diffusion MRI to monitor astrocyte activity in a mouse brain model through the inhibition of AQP4 channels with TGN-020. Upon TGN-020 injection, we observed a significant decrease in the Sindex, a diffusion marker of tissue microstructure, and a significant increase of the water diffusion coefficient (sADC) in cerebral cortex and hippocampus compared to saline injection. These results indicate the suitability of diffusion MRI to monitor astrocytic activity in vivo and non-invasively.",
