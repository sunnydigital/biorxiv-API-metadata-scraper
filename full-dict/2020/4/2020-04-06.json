    "abstract": "Colour vision is largely mediated by changes in number, expression, and spectral properties of rhodopsins, but the genetic mechanisms underlying adaptive shifts in spectral sensitivity remain largely unexplored. Using in vivo photochemistry, optophysiology, and in vitro functional assays, we link variation in eye spectral sensitivity at long wavelengths to species-specific absorbance spectra for LW opsins in lycaenid butterflies. In addition to loci specifying an ancestral green-absorbing rhodopsin with maximum spectral sensitivity ({lambda}max) at 520-530 nm in Callophrys sheridanii and Celastrina ladon, we find a novel form of red-shifted LW rhodopsin at {lambda}max = 565-570 nm in Arhopala japonica and Eumaeus atala. Furthermore, we show that Ca. sheridanii and Ce. ladon exhibit a smaller bathochromic shift at BRh2 (480-489 nm), and with the ancestral LW rhodopsin, cannot perceive visible red light beyond 600 nm. In contrast, molecular variation at the LW opsin in A. japonica and E. atala is coordinated with tuning of the blue opsin that also shifts sensitivity to longer wavelengths enabling colour discrimination up to 617 nm. We then use E. atala as a model to examine the interplay between red and blue spectral sensitivity. Owing to blue duplicate expression, the spatial distribution of opsin mRNAs within an ommatidium defines an expanded retinal stochastic mosaic of at least six opsin-based photoreceptor classes. Our mutagenesis in vitro assays with BRh1 ({lambda}max = 435 nm) chimeric blue rhodopsins reveal four main residues contributing to the 65 nm bathochromic shift towards BRh2 ({lambda}max = 500 nm). Adaptations in this four-opsin visual system are relevant for discrimination of conspecific reflectance spectra in E. atala. Together, these findings illustrate how functional changes at multiple rhodopsins contribute to the evolution of a broader spectral sensitivity and adaptation in visual performance.\n\nSignificance StatementRhodopsins are photosensitive protein molecules that absorb specific wavelengths of incoming light and convey colour information in the visual system. We show that molecular evolution in a green insect opsin gene resulted in a shift in its maximal absorbance peak, enabling some lycaenid butterflies to use spectral energy of longer wavelengths (LW) to discriminate colours in the red spectrum better than relatives bearing ancestral green LW rhodopsins. Lycaenids also evolved a duplicate blue opsin gene, and we illustrate an example where species equipped with red LW rhodopsins shifted their blue sensitivity peak to longer wavelengths due to changes in several blue-tuning residues that have evolved repeatedly in different insect lineages. We demonstrate how changes at multiple vision genes in the insect eye effectively create a coordinated mechanism expanding spectral sensitivity for visually guided behaviours such as selecting host plants and mates.",

    "abstract": "Nucleotide excision repair is the primary DNA repair mechanism that removes bulky DNA adducts such as UV-induced pyrimidine dimers. Correspondingly, genome-wide mapping of nucleotide excision repair with eXcision Repair sequencing (XR-seq), provides comprehensive profiling of DNA damage repair. A number of XR-seq experiments at a variety of conditions for different damage types revealed heterogenous repair in the human genome. Although human repair profiles were extensively studied, how repair maps vary between primates is yet to be investigated. Here, we characterized the genome-wide UV-induced damage repair in gray mouse lemur, Microcebus murinus, in comparison to human. Mouse lemurs are strictly nocturnal, are the worlds smallest living primates, and last shared a common ancestor with humans at least 60 million years ago. We derived fibroblast cell lines from mouse lemur, exposed them to UV irradiation. The following repair events were captured genome-wide through the XR-seq protocol. Mouse lemur repair profiles were analyzed in comparison to the equivalent human fibroblast datasets. We found that overall UV sensitivity, repair efficiency, and transcription-coupled repair levels differ between the two primates. Despite this, comparative analysis of human and mouse lemur fibroblasts revealed that genome-wide repair profiles of the homologous regions are highly correlated. This correlation is stronger for the highly expressed genes. With the inclusion of an additional XR-seq sample derived from another human cell line in the analysis, we found that fibroblasts of the two primates repair UV-induced DNA lesions in a more similar pattern than two distinct human cell lines do. Our results suggest that mouse lemurs and humans, and possibly primates in general, share a homologous repair mechanism as well as genomic variance distribution, albeit with their variable repair efficiency. This result also emphasizes the deep homologies of individual tissue types across the eukaryotic phylogeny.",

    "abstract": "When different senses are in conflict, one sense may dominate the perception of other sense, but it is not known whether the sensory cortex associated with the dominant modality exerts directional influence, at the functional brain level, over the sensory cortex associated with the dominated modality; in short, the link between sensory dominance and neuronal dominance is not established. In a task involving audio-visual conflict, using magnetoencephalography recordings in humans, we first demonstrated that the neuronal dominance - visual cortex being functionally influenced by the auditory cortex - was associated with the sensory dominance - participants visual perception being qualitatively altered by sound. Further, we found that prestimulus auditory-to-visual connectivity could predict the perceptual outcome on a trial-by-trial basis. Subsequently, we performed an effective connectivity-guided neurofeedback electroencephalography experiment and showed that participants who were briefly trained to increase the neuronal dominance from auditory to visual cortex also showed higher sensory, i.e. auditory, dominance during the conflict task immediately after the training. The results shed new light into the interactive neuronal nature of multisensory integration and open up exciting opportunities by enhancing or suppressing targeted mental functions subserved by effective connectivity.",

However, little is known about how visual inputs change neural dynamics as a function of running speed and time. By manipulating visual inputs in mice, we demonstrate that changes in spatial stability of grid cell firing as a function of time correlate with changes in a proposed speed signal by local field potential theta frequency. In contrast, visual inputs do not affect the speed modulation of firing rates. Moreover, we provide evidence that sensory inputs other than visual inputs can support grid cell firing, though less accurately, in complete darkness. Finally, changes in spatial accuracy of grid cell firing on a 10-s time scale suggest that grid cell firing is a function of velocity signals integrated over past time.",

Associative learning has long been considered a behavior performed only by animals, making this claim particularly newsworthy and interesting. In the experiment, plants were trained in Y-shaped mazes for three days with fans and lights attached at the top of the maze. Training consisted of wind consistently preceding light from either the same or the opposite arm of the maze. When plant growth forced a decision between the two arms of the maze, fans alone were able to influence growth direction, whereas the growth direction of untrained plants was not affected by fans. Importantly, some plants were trained to grow towards the fan and others to grow away, demonstrating the flexibility of associative learning. However, a replication of their protocol failed to demonstrate the same result, calling for further verification and study before mainstream acceptance of this paradigm-shifting phenomenon. This replication attempt used a larger sample size and fully blinded analysis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPoor sleep quality and insomnia have been associated with the use of tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis, but it is unclear if there is a causal link. In this Mendelian Randomization (MR) study we examine if insomnia causes substance use and/or if substance use causes insomnia.\n\nMethodsMR uses summary effect estimates from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to create a genetic instrumental variable for a proposed  exposure variable and then identifies that same genetic instrument in an  outcome GWAS. With data of GWAS of insomnia, smoking (initiation, heaviness, cessation), alcohol use (drinks per week, dependence), and cannabis initiation, bi-directional causal effects were tested. Multiple sensitivity analyses were applied to assess the robustness of the findings.\n\nResultsThere was strong evidence for positive causal effects of insomnia on all substance use phenotypes (smoking traits, alcohol dependence, cannabis initiation), except alcohol per week. The effects on alcohol dependence and cannabis initiation were attenuated after filtering out pleiotropic SNPs. In the other direction, there was strong evidence that smoking initiation increased chances of insomnia (smoking heaviness and cessation could not be tested as exposures). We found no evidence that alcohol use per week, alcohol dependence, or cannabis initiation causally affect insomnia.\n\nConclusionsThere were unidirectional effects of insomnia on alcohol dependence and cannabis initiation, and bidirectional effects between insomnia and smoking measures. Bidirectional effects between smoking and insomnia might give rise to a vicious circle. Future research should investigate if interventions aimed at insomnia are beneficial for substance use treatment.",

    "abstract": "Cortical and limbic brain areas are regarded as centres for learning. However, how thalamic sensory relays participate in plasticity upon associative learning, yet support stable long-term sensory coding remains unknown. Using a miniature microscope imaging approach, we monitor the activity of populations of auditory thalamus (MGB) neurons in freely moving mice upon fear conditioning. We find that single cells exhibit mixed selectivity and heterogeneous plasticity patterns to auditory and aversive stimuli upon learning, which is conserved in amygdala-projecting MGB neurons. In contrast to individual cells, population level encoding of auditory stimuli remained stable across days. Our data identifies MGB as a site for complex neuronal plasticity in fear learning upstream of the amygdala that is in an ideal position to drive plasticity in cortical and limbic brain areas. These findings suggest that MGBs role goes beyond a sole relay function by balancing experience-dependent, diverse single cell plasticity with consistent ensemble level representations of the sensory environment to support stable auditory perception with minimal affective bias.",

However, whether more actin assembles at endocytic sites in response to increased load, as has been observed in lamellipodia, has not previously been investigated. Here actin network ultrastructure at CME sites was examined under low and high membrane tension. Actin and N-WASP spatial organization indicate that actin polymerization initiates at the base of clathrin-coated pits and that the network then grows away from the plasma membrane. Actin network height at individual CME sites was not coupled to coat shape, raising the possibility that local differences in mechanical load feedback on assembly. By manipulating membrane tension and Arp2/3 complex activity we tested the hypothesis that actin assembly at CME sites increases in response to elevated load. Indeed, in response to elevated membrane tension, actin grew higher, resulting in greater coverage of the clathrin coat, and CME slowed. When membrane tension was elevated and the Arp2/3 complex was inhibited, shallow clathrin-coated pits accumulated, indicating that this adaptive mechanism is especially crucial for coat curvature generation. We propose that actin assembly increases in response to increased load to ensure CME robustness over a range of plasma membrane tensions.",

Here, an oral SARS-COV-2 RBD live vaccine containing LTB26 adjuvant has been developed. BALB/c mice are oral vaccinated with attenuated Salmonella typhimurium SL7207 containing pcDNA3.1-LTB26RBD or pcDNA3.1-RBD plasmids. The result shows that the high level of RBD specific antibody is produced in pcDNA3.1- LTB26RBD treatment. The mechanism indicates that LTB26 enhances RBD antibody production by significantly upregulating the activity of MHC II+ DCs and CD19+CD45+ B cells. LTB26 mutant is derived from heat-labile enterotoxin B subunit (LTB) wild type of Escherichia coli with enhanced immune adjuvanticity. Based on the pre-experiment result that SL7207 interferes the function of LTB26, the purified LTB26 was mixed with purified human rotavirus VP8 antigen to explore the mechanism of adjuvant. The results suggests that LTB26 enhances mucosal immune responses via increased of BCR and MHC II+ expression. Furthermore, LTB26 promotes both Th1 and Th2 cell mediated immunity. Therefore, LTB26 maybe a potent adjuvant for mucosal vaccine development in view of the safety of LTB26 than LT toxin.",

    "abstract": "Viruses require host factors to support their replication, and genetic variation in such factors can affect susceptibility to infectious disease. Influenza virus replication in human cells relies on ANP32 proteins, which are involved in assembly of replication-competent dimeric influenza virus polymerase (FluPol) complexes. Here, we investigate naturally occurring single nucleotide variants (SNV) in the human Anp32A and Anp32B genes. We note that variant rs182096718 in Anp32B is found at a higher frequency than other variants in either gene. This SNV results in a D130A substitution in ANP32B, which is less able to support FluPol activity than wildtype ANP32B and binds FluPol with lower affinity. Interestingly, ANP32B-D130A exerts a dominant negative effect over wildtype ANP32B and interferes with the functionally redundant paralogue ANP32A. FluPol activity and virus replication are attenuated in CRISPR-edited cells expressing wildtype ANP32A and mutant ANP32B-D130A. We propose a model in which the D130A mutation impairs FluPol dimer formation, thus resulting in compromised replication. We suggest that both homozygous and heterozygous carriers of rs182096718 may have some genetic protection against influenza viruses.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic transmission leading to release of neurotransmitters in the nervous system is a fast and highly dynamic process. Previously, protein interaction and phosphorylation have been thought to be the main regulators of synaptic transmission. Here we show a novel potential modulator of synaptic transmission, sialylation of N-linked glycosylation. The negatively charged sialic acids can be modulated, similarly to phosphorylation, by the action of sialyltransferases and sialidases thereby changing local structure and function of membrane glycoproteins. We characterized site-specific alteration in sialylation on N-linked glycoproteins in isolated rat nerve terminals after brief depolarization using quantitative sialiomics. We identified 1965 formerly sialylated N-linked glycosites in synaptic proteins and found that the abundances of 430 glycosites changed after five seconds depolarization. We observed changes on essential synaptic proteins such as synaptic vesicle proteins, ion channels and transporters, neurotransmitter receptors and cell adhesion molecules. This study is to our knowledge the first to describe ultra-fast site-specific modulation of the sialiome after brief stimulation of a biological system.",

    "abstract": "Most of our current knowledge on plant molecular biology is based on experiments in controlled lab environments. Over the years, lab experiments have generated substantial insights in the molecular wiring of plant developmental processes, stress responses and phenotypes. However, translating these insights from the lab to the field is often not straightforward, in part because field growth conditions are very different from lab conditions. Here, we test a new experimental design to unravel the molecular wiring of plants and study gene-phenotype relationships directly in the field. We molecularly profiled a set of individual maize plants of the same inbred background grown in the same field, and used the resulting data to predict the phenotypes of individual plants and the function of maize genes. We show that the field transcriptomes of individual plants contain as much information on maize gene function as traditional lab-generated transcriptomes of pooled plant samples subject to controlled perturbations. Moreover, we show that field-generated transcriptome and metabolome data can be used to quantitatively predict at least some individual plant phenotypes. Our results show that profiling individual plants in the field is a promising experimental design that could help narrow the lab-field gap.",

We show that, in contrast to the canonical L-alanine or benzylamine moieties which have previously been reported as efficacious pro-drug moieties, small aliphatic amines demonstrate greater drug release efficacy for our phosphonate inhibitor.

    "abstract": "In modern microscopy imaging systems, optical components are carefully designed to obtain diffraction-limited resolution. However, live imaging of large biological samples rarely attains this limit because of sample induced refractive index inhomogeneities that create unknown temporally variant optical aberrations. Importantly, these aberrations are also spatially variant, thus making it challenging to correct over wide fields of view. Here, we present a framework for deep-learning based wide-field optical aberration sensing and correction. Our model consists of two modules which take in a set of three phase-diverse images and (i) estimate the wavefront phase in terms of its constituent Zernike polynomial coefficients and (ii) perform blind-deconvolution to yield an aberration-free image. First, we demonstrate our framework on simulations that incorporate optical aberrations, spatial variance, and realistic modelling of sensor noise. We find that our blind deconvolution achieves a 2-fold improvement in frequency support compared to input images, and our phase-estimation achieves a coefficient of determination (r2) of at least 80% when estimating astigmatism, spherical aberration and coma. Second, we show that our results mostly hold for strongly varying spatially-variant aberrations with a 30% resolution improvement. Third, we demonstrate practical usability for light-sheet microscopy: we show a 46% increase in frequency support even in imaging regions affected by detection and illumination scattering.",

A second concept is neutral theory, and the idea of neutral dynamics underpinning metacommunity structure, cannot be overlooked. The third mechanism is the Mass Effect concept, that focuses on the interaction between environmental condition and neutral effects. In the present study, we partitioned fish communities in streams between niche and neutral theory concepts, identifying the best representation of metacommunity structure, and assessed if linear and hydrographic distance were equivalent in the representation of neutral processes. The result points to the importance of species sorting mechanisms in structuring fish communities with neutral processes best represented by the linear distances. On the other hand, the best representation of species niches was achieved with average values and variance of the local conditions.",

    "abstract": "Due to its importance for successful human behavior, research into cognitive control functioning has gained increasing interest. The paced auditory serial addition task (PASAT) has been used to test and train this fundamental function. It is a challenging task, requiring a high cognitive load in a stressful and frustrating environment. Its underlying neural mechanisms, however, are still unclear. To explore the neural signatures of the PASAT and their link to ongoing cognitive processing, feedback locked event-related potentials were derived from healthy participants during an adaptive 2-back version of the PASAT. Larger neural activation after negative feedback was found for feedback related negativity (FRN), P300 and late positive potential (LPP). In early stages of feedback processing (FRN), a larger difference between positive and negative feedback responses was associated with poorer overall performance, whereas this association was inverted for the later stages (P300 and LPP). This indicates stage-dependent associations of neural activation after negative information and cognitive functioning. Conceivably, increased early responses to negative feedback signify distraction whereas higher activity at later stages reflect cognitive control processes to preserve ongoing performance.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAberrant fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) expression is a major cause of poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer. MiR-203 is a newly discovered microRNA (miRNA) that can affect the biological behavior of tumors. This study investigated whether miR-203 can regulate FGF2 expression and its role in pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and migration.\n\nMethodsMiR-203 expression in different cell lines was examined by qRT-PCR, followed by the establishment of knockdown and overexpression cell models. We used the CCK-8 assay to examine cell proliferation and the annexin V-APC/7-AAD double-staining method to detect apoptosis. In addition, we used wound healing and transwell assays to investigate the effects of miR-203 on the migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells. The effects of miR-203 knockdown and overexpression on FGF2 mRNA expression were detected by qRT-PCR. We also overexpressed FGF2 and examined the effects of FGF2 overexpression on the proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and migration of pancreatic cancer cells. The binding of miR-203 to FGF2 was assessed by a luciferase reporter assay.\n\nResultsWe found that the miR-203 expression level was significantly down-regulated in pancreatic cancer cells compared to normal pancreatic cells. Functionally, the knockdown of miR-203 inhibited cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. Equally important, miR-203 reduced the migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells. In addition, we found that miR-203 overexpression inhibited FGF2 expression in pancreatic cancer cells by qRT-PCR. FGF2 overexpression significantly affected the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of pancreatic cancer cells. Mechanistically, miR-203 base-paired with the FGF2 mRNA, resulting in the knockdown of the FGF2 mRNA and the down-regulation of the FGF2 protein.\n\nConclusionsMiR-203 inhibits FGF2 expression, regulates the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells, and inhibits the invasion and metastasis of pancreatic cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Snakebite envenoming is an important public health problem in Iran, despite its risk not being quantified. This study aims to use venomous snakes habitat suitability as an indicator of snakebite risk, to identify high-priority areas for snakebite management across the country. Thus, an ensemble approach using five distribution modeling methods: Generalized Boosted Models, Generalized Additive Models, Maximum Entropy Modeling Generalized Linear Models, and Random Forest was applied to produce a spatial snakebite risk model for Iran. To achieve this, four venomous snakes habitat suitability (Macrovipera lebetina, Echis carinatus, Pseudocerastes persicus and Naja oxiana) were modeled and then multiplied. These medically important snakes are responsible for the most snakebite incidents in Iran. Multiplying habitat suitability models of the four snakes showed that the northeast of Iran (west of Khorasan-e-Razavi province) has the highest snakebite risk in the country. In addition, villages that were at risk of envenoming from the four snakes were identified. Results revealed that 51,112 villages are at risk of envenoming from M. lebetina, 30,339 from E. carinatus, 51,657 from P. persicus and 12,124 from N. oxiana. This paper demonstrates application of species distribution modeling in public health research and identified potential snakebite risk areas in Iran by using venomous snakes habitat suitability models as an indicating factor. Results of this study can be used in snakebite and human-snake conflict management in Iran. We recommend increasing public awareness of snakebite envenoming and education of local people in areas which identified with the highest snakebite risk.",

    "abstract": "The literature reports several symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 in humans such as fever, cough, fatigue, pneumonia, and headache. Furthermore, patients infected with similar strains (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) suffered testis, liver, or thyroid damage. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) serves as an entry point into cells for some strains of coronavirus (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2). Our hypothesis was that as ACE2 is essential to the SARS-CoV-2 virus invasion, then brain regions where ACE2 is the most expressed are more likely to be disturbed by the infection. Thus, the expression of other genes which are also over-expressed in those damaged areas could be affected. We used mRNA expression levels data of genes provided by the Allen Human Brain Atlas (ABA), and computed spatial correlations with the LinkRbrain platform. Genes whose co-expression is spatially correlated to that of ACE2 were then clustered into 16 groups, depending on the organ in which they are the most expressed (as described by the NCBI genes database). The list of organs where genes sharing local over-expression with the ACE2 gene are the most expressed is astonishingly similar to the organs affected by Covid-19.",

Fruits and berries from horticultural plants are known to be good sources of agents beneficial for human well-being and could serve as natural preservatives in the food industry. However, more recent research indicates that other plant organs can also be rich in nutrients. Our study focused on characterizing an unexplored source: leaf and twig extracts from Rosa canina. The chemical composition of these extracts was analyzed and their in vitro activity measured. HPLC analysis of the content of phenolics, vitamins and amino acids revealed that the leaf and twig extracts are rich in bioactive compounds with potent antioxidant properties. The greatest differences between bioactive phenolic compounds in leaf and twig extracts related mainly to p-coumaric acid, myricetin, ellagic acid, cyanidin, procyanidin and quercetin, whereas salicylic acid levels were similar in both types of extract.\n\nInteractions with human serum albumin were investigated and some conformational changes in protein structure were observed. Further analysis (lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, thiol group oxidation, DPPH inhibition and ROS inhibition) confirmed that both leaf and twig extracts exhibited antioxidant and antiradical scavenging activities. Cytotoxicity and hemotoxicity assays confirmed very low toxicity in the extracts over the range of concentrations tested. Our results indicate that both extracts could serve as non-toxic sources of bioactive compounds with antiradical properties.",

This specification also enforces the annotation of knowledge concepts and statements to the NCATS endorsed the Biolink Model data model and semantic encoding standards (https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/). Implementation of this API on top of diverse knowledge sources potentially enables their uniform integration behind client software which will facilitate research access and integration of biomedical knowledge.\n\nAvailabilityThe API and associated software is open source and currently available for access at https://github.com/NCATS-Tangerine/translator-knowledge-beacon.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAfrican trypanosomiasis (AT) is a neglected disease of both humans and animals caused by Trypanosoma parasites, which are transmitted by obligate hematophagous tsetse flies (Glossina spp.). Understanding of AT transmission is hampered by limited knowledge on interactions of tsetse flies with their vertebrate hosts and the influence of endosymbionts on vector competence, especially in wildlife-human-livestock interfaces. We identified the tsetse species, their blood-meal sources, and the correlation between endosymbiont and trypanosome infection status in the trypanosome-endemic Maasai Mara National Reserve (MMNR) of Kenya.\n\nMethodology/Principal FindingsAmong 1167 tsetse flies (1136 Glossina pallidipes, 31 Glossina swynnertoni) collected from 10 sampling sites, 28 (2.4%) were positive by PCR for trypanosomes, majority (17/28) being Trypanosoma vivax. Blood-meal analyses based on high-resolution melting analysis of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 and cytochrome b gene PCR products (n = 345) identified humans as the most common vertebrate host (37%), followed by hippopotamus (29.1%), African buffalo (26.3%), elephant (3.39%), and giraffe (0.84%). Trypanosome-infected flies had fed on hippopotamus and buffalo. Additionally, PCR analysis revealed that tsetse flies were more likely to be infected with trypanosomes if they were infected with the Sodalis glossinidius endosymbiont (P = 0.0022 Fishers exact test).\n\nConclusions/SignificanceDiverse species of wildlife hosts may contribute to the maintenance of tsetse populations and/or persistent circulation of African trypanosomes in the MMNR. Although the African buffalo is known to be a key reservoir of AT, the higher proportion of hippopotamus blood-meals in trypanosomes-infected flies identified here indicates that other wildlife species may also be important to transmission cycles. No trypanosomes associated with human disease were identified, but the high proportion of human blood-meals identified are indicative of human African trypanosomiasis transmission risk. Furthermore, this work provides data showing that Sodalis endosymbionts can is associated with increased trypanosome infection rates in endemic ecologies.\n\nAuthor summaryHuman and animal African trypanosomiasis are neglected tropical diseases with potential to spread to new areas. Wild animals are important reservoirs for African trypanosomes and crucial in the emergence and re-emergence of AT. Vertebrate host-vector-parasite interactions are integral to trypanosome transmission. We investigated the vertebrate blood-meals and trypanosomes-endosymbionts co-infections in tsetse flies, which have been associated with reservoirs and vector competence, respectively, on AT transmission in Kenyas Maasai Mara National Reserve. We identified tsetse fly diversity, trypanosome and endosymbiont infection status, and vertebrate blood-meal hosts to infer potential transmission dynamics. We found that Glossina pallidipes was the major tsetse fly vector and that Trypanosoma vivax was the main trypanosome species circulating in the region. Humans, hippopotamus, and buffalo were the most frequented for blood-meals. Buffalo and hippopotamus blood-meals were identified in trypanosome infected flies. Feeding of the flies on both humans and wildlife may potentiate the risk of the human trypanosomiasis in this ecology. Additionally, we found that the endosymbiont Sodalis glossinidius is associated with higher trypanosome infection rates in wild tsetse flies. These findings emphasize the importance of understanding the interaction of tsetse flies with vertebrate blood-meal sources and their endosymbionts in the transmission and control of AT.",

    "abstract": "To understand the nature of the complex behavior of the brain, one important step is to identify \"cores\" in the brain network, where neurons or brain areas strongly interact with each other. Cores can be considered as essential sub-networks for brain functions. In the last few decades, an information-theoretic approach to identifying cores has been developed. In this approach, many-to-many nonlinear interactions between parts are measured by an information loss function, which quantifies how much information would be lost if interactions between parts were removed. Then, a core called a \"complex\" is defined as a subsystem wherein the amount of information loss is locally maximal. Although identifying complexes can be a novel and useful approach to revealing essential properties of the brain network, its practical application is hindered by the fact that computation time grows exponentially with system size. Here we propose a fast and exact algorithm for finding complexes, called Hierarchical Partitioning for Complex search (HPC). HPC finds complexes by hierarchically partitioning systems to narrow down candidates for complexes. The computation time of HPC is polynomial, which is dramatically smaller than exponential. We prove that HPC is exact when an information loss function satisfies a mathematical property, monotonicity. We show that mutual information is one such information loss function. We also show that a broad class of submodular functions can be considered as such information loss functions, indicating the expandability of our framework to the class. In simulations, we show that HPC can find complexes in large systems (up to several hundred) in a practical amount of time when mutual information is used as an information loss function. Finally, we demonstrate the use of HPC in electrocorticogram recordings from monkeys. HPC revealed temporally stable and characteristic complexes, indicating that it can be reliably utilized to characterize brain networks.\n\nAuthor summaryAn important step in understanding the nature of the brain is to identify \"cores\" in the brain network, which can be considered as essential areas for brain functions and cognition. In the last few decades, a novel definition of cores has been developed, which takes account of many-to-many interactions among elements of the network. Although considering many-to-many interactions can be important in understanding the complex brain network, identifying cores in large systems has been impossible because of the extremely large computational costs required. Here, we propose a fast and exact algorithm for finding cores. We show that the proposed algorithm enables us to find cores in large systems consisting of several hundred elements in a practical amount of time. We applied our algorithm to electrocorticogram recordings from a monkey that monitored electrical activity of the brain with electrodes placed directly on the brain surface, and demonstrated that there are stable and characteristic core structures in the brain network. This result indicates that our algorithm can be reliably applied to uncovering the essential network structures of the brain.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to identify the biological features, influence factor and Genome-wide properties of pathogenic donkey Escherichia coli (DEC) isolates associated with severe diarrhea in Northern China.\n\nMethodsThe isolation and identification of DEC isolates were carried out by the conventional isolationautomatic biochemical analysis systemserotype identification16S rRNA testanimal challenge and antibiotics sensitivity examination. The main virulence factors were identified by PCR. The complete genomic re-sequence and frame-sequence were analyzed.\n\nResults216 strains of DEC were isolated from diarrhea samples, conforming to the bacterial morphology and biochemical characteristics of E.coli. The average size of the pure culture was 329.4 nmx223.5 nm. Agglutination test showed that O78 (117/179, 65.4%) was the dominant serotype and ETEC(130/216, 60.1%) was the dominant pathogenic type. Noticeable pathogenic were observed in 9 of 10 (90%) randomly selected DEC isolates caused the death of test mice (100%, 5/5) within 6h[~]48h, 1 of 10 (10%) isolates caused the death of test mice (40%, 2/5) within 72h. Our data confirmed that DEC plays an etiology role in dirarrea/death case of donkey foal. Antibiotics sensitivity test showed significant susceptibility to DEC isolates were concentrated in NorEFTENRCIP and AMK,while the isolates with severe antibiotic resistance was AMTEAPRFFCRL and CN. Multi-drug resistance was also observed. A total of 15 virulence gene fragments were determined from DEC(n=30) including OMPA (73%), safD (77%), traTa (73%), STa(67%), EAST1 (67%), astA (63%), kspII (60%), irp2 (73%), iucD (57%), eaeA (57%), VAT (47%), iss (33%), cva (27%), ETT2 (73%) and K88 (60%) respectively. More than 10 virulence genes from 9 of 30(30%) DEC strains were detected, while 6 of 30(20%) DEC strains detected 6 virulence factors. phylogenetic evolutionary tree of 16S rRNA gene from different isolates shows some variability. The original data volume obtained from the genome re-sequencing of DEC La18 was 2.55G and Genome framework sequencing was carried out to demonstrate the predicted functions and evolutionary direction and genetic relationships with other animal E.coli.\n\nConclusionsThese findings provide firstly fundamental data that might be useful in further study of the role of DEC and provide a new understanding of the hazards of traditional colibacillosis due to the appear of new production models.",

    "abstract": "Precise and reliable determination of the nucleic acid concentration in biological samples still remains a challenge. This is particularly since the established fluorescene-based methods provide insufficient results, when only minute sample quantitites are available for analysis. Among other effects, photobleaching is the main reason for this. Since large molecules diffuse more slowly than small molecules, they are exposed to more excitation cycles and therefore have a higher probability of permanently losing their fluorescence. Solutions with large molecules hence show a reduced fluorescence. In this paper we present a method to correct this effect and thus allow high-precision sample concentration determination in minute sample quantities (< 2 {micro}l drops with concentrations < 20 pg/{micro}l). For this purpose, we used confocal microscopy with single molecule sensitivity. In the first step, we derived calibration curves from DNA solutions with defined fragment length. We analyzed dilution series over a wide concentration range (1 pg/{micro}l - 1000 pg/{micro}l) and measured their specific diffusion coefficients by employing fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Using this information, we correct the measured fluorescence intensity of the calibration solutions for photobleaching effects. Subsequently, we evaluated our method by analyzing a series of DNA mixtures of varying composition.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionary origins of human-associated bacteriophage communities are poorly understood. To address this question, we examined fecal phageomes of 23 wild non-human primate taxa, including multiple representatives of all the major primate radiations, and find relatives of the majority of human-associated phages. Primate taxa have distinct phageome compositions that exhibit a clear phylosymbiotic signal, and phage-superhost co-divergence is detected for 44 individual phages. Within species, neighboring social groups harbor evolutionarily and compositionally distinct phageomes, structured by superhost social behavior. However, captive non-human primate phageomes are more similar to humans than their wild counterparts, revealing replacement of wild-associated phages with human-associated ones. Together, our results suggest that potentially labile primate-phage associations persisted across millions of years of evolution, potentially facilitated by transmission between groupmates.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryRelatives of human-associated phages in wild primates reveal ancient but dynamic superhost-phage associations shaped by social transmission.",

    "abstract": "Boolean logic and arithmetic through DNA excision (BLADE) is a recently developed platform for implementing inducible and logical control over gene expression in mammalian cells, which has the potential to revolutionise cell engineering for therapeutic applications. This 2-input 2-output platform can implement 256 different logical circuits that exploit the specificity and stability of DNA recombination. Here, we develop the first mechanistic mathematical model of the 2-input BLADE platform based on Cre- and Flp-mediated DNA excision. After calibrating the model on experimental data from two circuits, we demonstrate close agreement between model outputs and data on the other 111 circuits that have so far been experimentally constructed using the 2-input BLADE platform. Model simulations of the remaining 143 circuits that have yet to be tested experimentally predict excellent performance of the 2-input BLADE platform across the range of possible circuits. Circuits from both the tested and untested subsets that perform less well consist of a disproportionally high number of STOP sequences. Model predictions suggested that circuit performance declines with a decrease in recombinase expression and new experimental data was generated that confirms this relationship.",
