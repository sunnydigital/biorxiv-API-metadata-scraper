    "abstract": "Evaluating progress throughout a patients rehabilitation episode is critical for determining effectiveness of the selected treatments and contributing to the evidence-based practice. The evaluation process is complex due to the inherent large human variations in motor recovery and the limitations of commonly used clinical measurement tools. Information recorded during a robot-assisted rehabilitation process can provide an effective means to continuously quantitatively assess movement performance and rehabilitation progress. However, selecting appropriate motion features for rehabilitation evaluation has always been challenging. This paper exploits unsupervised feature learning techniques to reduce the complexity of building the evaluation model of patients progress. A new feature learning technique is developed to select the most significant features from a large amount of kinematic features measured from robotics, providing clinically useful information to health practitioners with reduction of modeling complexity. A novel indicator that can reflect monotonicity and trendability is proposed to evaluate the suitability of kinematic features, which are derived from the collected data of a population of stroke patients participating in robot-aided rehabilitation. The selected kinematic features allow for human variations across a population of patients as well as over the sequence of rehabilitation sessions. The study is based on data records pertaining to 41 stroke patients using three different robot assisted exercises for upper limb rehabilitation. Consistent with the literature, the results indicate that features based on movement smoothness are the best measures among 17 kinematic features used to evaluate rehabilitation progress.",

    "abstract": "Protein structural families are groups of homologous proteins defined by the organization of secondary structure elements (SSEs). Nowadays, many families contain vast numbers of structures, and the SSEs can help to orient within them. Communities around specific protein families have even developed specialized SSE annotations, always assigning the same name to the equivalent SSEs in homologous proteins. A detailed analysis of the groups of equivalent SSEs provides an overview of the studied family and enriches the analysis of any particular protein at hand.\n\nWe developed a workflow for the analysis of the secondary structure anatomy of a protein family. We applied this analysis to the model family of cytochromes P450 (CYPs) - a family of important biotransformation enzymes with a community-wide used SSE annotation. We report the occurrence, typical length and amino acid sequence for the equivalent SSE groups, the conservation/variability of these properties and relationship to the substrate recognition sites. We also suggest a generic residue numbering scheme for the CYP family. Comparing the bacterial and eukaryotic part of the family highlights the significant differences and reveals an anomalous group of bacterial CYPs with some typically eukaryotic features. Application of our workflow to other families could produce equally surprising findings.",

    "abstract": "Ca2+/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a dodecameric or tetradecameric enzyme with crucial roles in neuronal signaling and cardiac function. Activation of CaMKII is reported to trigger the exchange of subunits between holoenzymes, which can increase spread of the active state. Using mass spectrometry, we now show that peptides derived from the sequence of the CaMKII- regulatory segment can bind to the CaMKII- hub assembly and break it into smaller oligomers. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the regulatory segments can dock spontaneously at the interface between hub subunits, trapping large fluctuations in hub structure. Single-molecule fluorescence intensity analysis of human CaMKII- isolated from mammalian cells shows that activation of CaMKII- results in the destabilization of the holoenzyme. Our results show how the release of the regulatory segment by activation and phosphorylation could allow it to destabilize the hub, producing smaller CaMKII assemblies that can reassemble to form new holoenzymes.",

    "abstract": "The circadian rhythm drives the oscillatory expression of thousands of genes across all tissues, coordinating physiological processes. The effect of this rhythm on health has generated increasing interest in discovering genes under circadian control by searching for periodic patterns in transcriptomic time-series experiments. While algorithms for detecting cycling transcripts have advanced, there remains little guidance quantifying the effect of experimental design and analysis choices on cycling detection accuracy. We present TimeTrial, a user-friendly benchmarking framework using both real and synthetic data to investigate cycle detection algorithms performance and improve circadian experimental design. Results show that the optimal choice of analysis method depends on the sampling scheme, noise level, and shape of the waveform of interest; and provides guidance on the impact of sampling frequency and duration on cycling detection accuracy. The TimeTrial software is freely available for download and may also be accessed through a web interface. By supplying a tool to vary and optimize experimental design considerations, TimeTrial will enhance circadian transcriptomics studies.",

Using transgenic mouse models, we show that taste signal transduction cascades (mTas1r3-Gnat3-Trmp5) are observed in testis form GFP transgenic mice. It is mTas1rs and mTas2rs, not Gnat3, that was expressed in leydig and sertoli cells. The pattern of mTas1r3 expression was different from that of mTas2r105 expression in seminiferous epithelium. Analysis of the seminiferous epithelium cycle show that both mTas1r3 and mTas2r105 is expressed in the spermatid stage, but mTas2r5 expression is found in spermatocyte stage. Conditional deletion of mTas1r3+ cells leads to male infertility, but do not affect the expression of taste signal transduction cascade during the spermatogenesis.

    "abstract": "Mobile pelagic species habitat is structured around dynamic oceanographic and ecological processes which operate and interact horizontally and vertically throughout the water column and change over time. However, pelagic species movements and distributions are often poorly understood. We use the Maxent species distribution model to assess how changes in the relative importance of modelled oceanographic (e.g., temperature) and climatic variables (e.g., the North Atlantic Oscillation) over 17-years affect the monthly average horizontal and vertical distribution of a keystone pelagic forage species, Atlantic Canadian capelin (Mallotus villosus). We show the range and distribution of capelin occurrence probabilities vary across horizontal and vertical axes over time, with binary presence/absence predictions indicating capelin occupy between 0.72% (April) and 3.45% (November) of the total modelled space. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the importance of modelled oceanographic variables, such as temperature, vary between months (44% permutation importance in August to 2% in May). By capturing the spatial dynamics of capelin over horizontal, vertical, and temporal axes, our analysis builds on work that improves our understanding and predictive modelling ability of pelagic species distributions under current and future conditions for pro-active ecosystem-based management.",

    "abstract": "The benefits of dominance are well known and numerous, including first access to resources such as food, mates and nesting sites. Less well studied are the potential costs associated with being dominant. Here, the movement of two flocks of domestic homing pigeons (Columba livia) - measured via accelerometry loggers - was recorded over a period of two weeks. Movement was then used to calculate each individuals daily overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA, G), which can be used as a proxy for energy expenditure. The dominance hierarchy of the two flocks was determined via group-level antagonistic interactions, and demonstrated a significantly linear structure. The most dominant bird within each flock was found to move significantly more than conspecifics - on average, c.39% greater than the individual with the next highest degree of movement - indicating a possible cost to possessing the top rank within a hierarchy. Despite the dominance hierarchy being linear, mean daily total ODBA did not reflect a linear nature, with no pattern observed between rank and ODBA, once the top ranked individuals had been accounted for. This suggest that energy expenditure may be more reflective of a despotic hierarchy. These results show the potential for the future use of accelerometery as a tool to study the fusion of energetics and behaviour.\n\nSubject Categorybehaviour\n\nSubject Areasbehaviour, physiology",

While this label-free cryogenic imaging technology produces data containing rich structural information, automated identification of macromolecules inside cellular tomograms is challenged by noise and reconstruction artifacts, as well as the presence of many molecular species in the crowded volumes. Here, we present a computational procedure that uses artificial neural networks to simultaneously localize with a multi-class strategy several macromolecular species in cellular cryo-electron tomograms. Once trained, the inference stage of DeepFinder is significantly faster than template matching, and performs better than other competitive deep learning methods at identifying macromolecules of various sizes in both synthetic and experimental datasets. On cellular cryo-ET data, DeepFinder localized membrane-bound and cytosolic ribosomes (~3.2 MDa), Rubisco (~540 kDa soluble complex), and photosystem II (~550 kDa membrane complex) with comparable accuracy to expert-supervised ground truth annotations. Furthermore, we show that DeepFinder is flexible and can be combined with template matching to localize the missing macromolecules not found by one or the other method. The DeepFinder algorithm is therefore very promising for the semi-automated analysis of a wide range of molecular targets in cellular tomograms, including macromolecules with weights of 500-600 kDa and membrane proteins.",

The inaccessibility of the gut and inter-connections between gut bacteria and the host make it difficult to precisely target bacterial functions without disrupting the microbiota and/or host physiology. Herein we describe a multidisciplinary approach to modulate the expression of a specific bacterial gene within the gut by oral administration. We first demonstrate that an engineered temperate phage {lambda} expressing a programmable dCas9 represses a targeted E. coli gene in the mammalian gut. To facilitate phage administration while minimizing disruption to host processes, we develop an aqueous-based encapsulation formulation with a microbiota-based release mechanism and show that it facilitates the oral delivery of phage in vivo. Finally we combine these technologies and show that bacterial gene expression in the mammalian gut can be precisely modified in situ with a single oral dose.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) are grouped into several classes with diverse sequences. Owing to their diversity, studies involving the detection, classification, and annotation of TEs are difficult tasks. Moreover, simple comparisons of TEs among different species with different methods can lead to misinterpretations. The genome data of several honey bee (Apis) species are available in public databases. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of TEs, using 11 sets of genome data for Apis species, in order to establish the basal TE data (termed here as the  landscape of TEs). Consensus TE sequences were constructed and their distributions in the Apis genomes were determined. Our results showed that TEs from several limited families mainly consisted of Apis TEs and that more DNA/TcMar-Mariner consensus sequences and copies were present in all Apis genomes tested. In addition, more consensus sequences and copy numbers of DNA/TcMar-Mariner were detected in Apis mellifera than in other Apis species. These results suggest that TcMar-Mariner might exert A. mellifera-specific effects on the host A. mellifera species. In conclusion, our unified approach enabled comparison of Apis genome sequences to determine the TE landscape, which provide novel evolutionary insights into Apis species.\n\nSimple SummaryStudies on the detection of transposable elements and their annotations have posed several challenges. For example, simple comparisons of transposable elements in different species using different methods can lead to misinterpretations. Thus, assembling data for transposable elements analyzed by unified methods is important for comparison purposes. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of transposable elements identified using genome datasets from 5 Apis species (11 sets of genome data) and specific software to detect the transposable elements, which revealed the landscapes of transposable elements. We examined the types and locations of transposable elements in the Apis genomes. The landscapes of transposable elements showed that several limited transposable element families consisted mainly of Apis-associated transposable elements. These limited families include DNA/TcMar-Mariner and DNA/CMC-EnSpm. In addition, more DNA/TcMar-Mariner consensus sequences and copies were detected in Apis mellifera than in other Apis species. These data suggest that TcMar-Mariner might exert A. mellifera-specific effects in the host A. mellifera species. Our landscape data provide new insights into Apis transposable elements; furthermore, detailed analyses of our data could pave the way for new biological insights in this field.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSarcopenia is a serious public health problem. The ceRNA network has been demonstrated vital in the development of skeletal muscle, but there is currently no effective method to assess the risk of sarcopenia. The purpose of this research is to create and authenticate a ceRNA pathway based on a predictive model of sarcopenia.\n\nMethodsA clinical prediction model for sarcopenia was established using the RNAs (validated by clinical data) that are co-differentially expressed in the database, and a ceRNA network was constructed. The correlation analysis of each element in the ceRNA network was performed according to the clinical samples and the GTEX database, and the possible key ceRNA pathways were screened. C2C12 mouse myoblast Cells experiments were used to verify these ceRNA pathways.\n\nFindingsBased on four molecular markers of SEPP1, SV2A, GOT1 and GFOD1, we developed a new model for predicting sarcopenia with well accuracy, and constructed a ceRNA network accordingly. Clinical sample showed that the expression levels of lncDLEU2, SEPP1, and miR-181a were closely related to the risk of sarcopenia. The C2C12 mouse myoblast cells were cultivated to verify that lncDLEU2 inhibits muscle proliferation and differentiation by acting as a miR-181a sponge regulated SEPP1.\n\nInterpretationOur research developed a highly accurate prediction tool for the risk of sarcopenia. These findings suggest that lncDLEU2-miR-181a-SEPP1 pathway inhibits muscle differentiation and regeneration. This pathway may uncover some new therapeutic targets for the treatment of sarcopenia caused by aging.",

It has quickly spawned a multitude of methods such as Prime Editing, Crispr/Cas9 assisted APEX proximity labeling of proteins, or homology directed repair (HDR), for which supporting bioinformatic tools are, however, lagging behind. New applications often require specific guide-RNA (gRNA) design functionality, and a generic gRNA design tool is critically missing. Here we review gRNA designer software and introduce multicrispr, an R based tool intended to design individual gRNAs as well as gRNA libraries targeting many genomic loci in parallel. The package is easy to use, detects, scores and filters gRNAs on both efficiency and specificity, visualizes and aggregates results per target or Crispr/Cas9 sequence, and finally returns both genomic ranges as well as sequences of preferred, off target-free gRNAs. In order to be generic, multicrispr defines and implements a genomic arithmetics framework as a basis for facile adaptation to techniques yet to arise. Its performance and new gRNA design concepts such as target set specific filtering for gRNA libraries render multicrispr the tool of choice when dealing with screening-like approaches.",

    "abstract": "Self-activation coupled to a transport mechanism results in traveling waves that describe polymerization reactions, forest fires, tumor growth, and even the spread of epidemics. Diffusion is a simple and commonly used model of particle transport. Many physical and biological systems are, however, better described by persistent random walks that switch between multiple states of ballistic motion. So far, traveling fronts in persistent random walk models have only been analyzed in special, simplified cases. Here, we formulate the general model of reaction-transport processes in such systems and show how to compute the expansion velocity for arbitrary number of states. For the two-state model, we obtain a closed-form expression for the velocity and report how it is affected by different transport and replication parameters. We also show that nonzero death rates result in a discontinuous transition from quiescence to propagation. We compare our results to a recent observation of a discontinuous onset of propagation in microtubule asters and comment on the universal nature of the underlying mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Electrically excitable cells often spontaneously and synchronously depolarize in vitro and in vivo. It remains unknown how cells synchronize and autorhythmically activate above the intrinsic mean activation frequency of isolated cells without pacemaking mechanisms. Recent insights into ephaptic coupling (non-gap junction or synaptic coupling) suggest that cyclic ion accumulation and depletion in diffusion limited extracellular volumes densely expressing ion channels modifies action potentials. This report explores how potassium accumulation and depletion in a restricted extracellular domain promotes spontaneous oscillations in the Hodgkin Huxley action potential model, which does not spontaneously activate on its own without external stimulus. Simulations demonstrate cells sharing a diffusion limited extracellular compartment can become autorhythmic and synchronous despite intercellular electrical heterogeneity. Autorhythmic frequency can be determined by net potassium flux into the cleft and the cleft volume. Additionally, inexcitable cells can induce autorhythmic activity in an excitable cell via a shared cleft and sufficient potassium fluxes contributed by each cell. Importantly, the synchronization and autorhythmic activity conferred by shared cleft with reduced potassium efflux can occur in the absence of gap junctions. Lastly, not only can potassium oscillations in shared restricted clefts initiate, support, and suppress autorhythmic depolarizations, the same mechanism can homogenize repolarization. The work has implications for understanding how automaticity is coordinated among excitable cells and suggests a new role for non-excitable cells such as fibroblasts, macrophages, or astrocytes with sarcolemmal potassium handling proteins facing shared and restricted intercellular clefts.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEA mechanism of cyclic ion accumulation and depletion in diffusion limited extracellular compartments can suppress, initiate, and support autorhythmic activity. Additionally, autorhythmicity can emerge from electrophysiologically heterogeneous cell pairs sharing a diffusion limited extracellular compartment, even if the individual cells will not spontaneously depolarize on their own. Sustained and synchronous autorhythmic activity can occur in the absence of gap junction coupling. Lastly, the shared diffusion limited extracellular compartment can also reduce action potential duration gradients by synchronizing repolarization.",

    "abstract": "Early-onset sporadic rectal cancer (EOSRC) is a unique and predominant colorectal cancer (CRC) subtype in India. In order to understand the tumorigenic process in EOSRC, we performed whole exome sequencing of 47 microsatellite stable EOSRC samples. Signature 1 was the predominant mutational signature in EOSRC, as previously shown in other CRC exome studies. More importantly, we identified TP53, KRAS, APC, PIK3R1 and SMAD4 as significantly mutated (q<0.1) and ARID1A and ARID2 as near-significantly mutated (restricted hypothesis testing; q<0.1) candidate drivers. Unlike the other candidates, the tumorigenic potential of ARID2, encoding a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, is largely unexplored in CRC. shRNA mediated ARID2 knockdown performed in two different CRC cell lines resulted in significant alterations in transcript levels of cancer-related target genes. More importantly, ARID2 knockdown promoted several tumorigenic features including cell viability, proliferation, ability to override contact inhibition of growth, and migration besides significantly increasing tumor formation ability in nude mice. The observed gain in tumorigenic features were rescued upon ectopic expression of ARID2. Analyses of the TCGA CRC dataset revealed poorer survival in patients with ARID2 alterations. We therefore propose ARID2 as a novel tumor suppressor in CRC.",

    "abstract": "Priority effect theory, a foundational concept from community ecology, states that the order and timing of species arrival during species assembly can affect species composition. Although this theory has been applied to co-infecting parasite species, it has almost always been with a single time lag between co-infecting parasites. Thus, how the timing of parasite species arrival affects co-infections and disease remains poorly understood. To address this gap in the literature, we exposed post-metamorphic Cuban tree frogs (Osteopilus septentrionalis) to Ranavirus, the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a nematode Aplectana hamatospicula, or pairs of these parasites either simultaneously or sequentially at a range of time lags and quantified load of the secondary parasite and host growth, survival and parasite tolerance. Prior exposure to Bd or A. hamatospicula significantly increased viral loads relative to hosts singly infected with Ranavirus, whereas A. hamatospicula loads in hosts were higher when co-exposed to Bd than when co-exposed to Ranavirus. There was a significant positive relationship between time since Ranavirus infection and Bd load, and prior exposure to A. hamatospicula decreased Bd loads compared to simultaneous co-infection with these parasites. Infections with Bd and Ranavirus either singly or in co-infections decreased host growth and survival. This research reveals that time lags between co-infections can affect parasite loads, in line with priority effects theory. As co-infections in the field are unlikely to be simultaneous, an understanding of when co-infections are impacted by time lags between parasite exposures may play a major role in controlling problematic co-infections.",

    "abstract": "Aside from the greenhouse gas reduction ability of palm oil-based biofuel as alternative to fossil fuels, another essential greenhouse gas mitigation ability of oil palm plantation is in terms of offsetting anthropogenic carbon emissions through carbon sequestration. In this context, this study was done to determine the carbon sequestration potential of oil palm plantations specifically in two areas in Mindanao, Philippines. Allometric equation was used in calculating the biomass of oil palm trunk. Furthermore, destructive methods were used to determine the biomass in other oil palm parts (fronds, leaves, and fruits). Carbon stocks from the other carbon pools in the oil palm plantations were measured which includes understory, litterfall, and soil. Results revealed that the average carbon stock in the oil palm plantations is 40.33 tC/ha. Majority of the carbon stock is found in the oil palm plant (53%), followed by soil (38%), litterfall (6%), and understory, (4%). The average carbon sequestration rate of oil palm plants is estimated to be 4.55 tC/ha/year. It is advised that oil palm expansions should be done on grasslands and barren lands instead of forest lands to avoid incurring \"carbon debts\". It is also recommended that oil palms should be mixed with shrub crops species to enhance soil organic carbon as well as increase the aboveground biomass in oil palm plantations.",

    "abstract": "Complement receptor 3 (CR3, also known as Mac-1, integrin M{beta}2, or CD11b/CD18) is expressed on a subset of myeloid and certain activated lymphoid cells. CR3 is essential for the phagocytosis of complement-opsonized particles such as pathogens and apoptotic or necrotic cells opsonized with the complement fragment iC3b and to a lesser extent C3dg. While the interaction between the iC3b thioester domain and the ligand binding CR3 M I-domain is structurally and functionally well characterized, the nature of additional CR3-iC3b interactions required for phagocytosis of complement opsonized objects remain obscure. Here we analyzed the interaction between iC3b and the 150 kDa headpiece fragment of the CR3 ectodomain. Surface plasmon resonance experiments demonstrated a 30 nM affinity of CR3 for iC3b compared to 515 nM for the iC3b thioester domain. Small angle x-ray scattering analysis revealed that iC3b adopts an extended but preferred conformation in solution. Upon interaction with CR3, iC3b rearranges to form a compact receptor-ligand complex. Overall, the data suggest that the iC3b-CR3 interaction is of high affinity and relies on minor contacts formed between CR3 and regions outside the iC3b thioester domain. Our results rationalize the more efficient phagocytosis elicited by iC3b than by C3dg and pave the way for development of specific therapeutics for treatment of inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases that do not interfere with recognition of non-complement CR3 ligands.",

    "abstract": "The fold classification of a protein reveals valuable information about its shape and function. It is important to find a mapping between protein structures and their folds. There are numerous machine learning techniques to predict protein folds from 1-dimensional (1D) protein sequences, but there are few machine learning methods to directly class protein 3D (tertiary) structures into predefined folds (e.g. folds defined in the SCOP database). We develop a 2D-convolutional neural network to classify any protein structure into one of 1232 folds. We extract two classes of input features for each protein: residue-residue distance matrix and persistent homology images derived from 3D protein structures. Due to restrictions in computing resources, we sample every other point in the carbon alpha chain to generate a reduced distance map representation. We find that it does not lead to significant loss in accuracy. Using the distance matrix, we achieve an accuracy of 95.2% on the SCOP dataset. With persistence homology images of 100 x 100 resolution, we achieve an accuracy of 56% on SCOPe 2.07 dataset. Combining the two kinds of features further improves classification accuracy.

    "abstract": "The macro-scale intrinsic functional network architecture of the human brain has been well characterized. Early studies revealed robust and enduring patterns of static connectivity, while more recent work has begun to explore the temporal dynamics of these large-scale brain networks. Little work to date has investigated directed connectivity within and between these networks, or the temporal patterns of afferent (input) and efferent (output) connections between network nodes. Leveraging a novel analytic approach, prediction correlation, we investigated the causal interactions within and between large-scale networks of the brain using resting-state fMRI. This technique allows us to characterize information transfer between brain regions in both the spatial (direction) and temporal (duration) scales. Using data from the Human Connectome Project (N=200) we applied prediction correlation techniques to four resting state fMRI runs (total TRs = 4800). Three central observations emerged. First, the strongest and longest duration connections were observed within the somatomotor, visual and dorsal attention networks. Second, the short duration connections were observed for high-degree nodes in the visual and default networks, as well as in hippocampus. Specifically, the connectivity profile of the highest-degree nodes was dominated by efferent connections to multiple cortical areas. Moderate high-degree nodes, particularly in hippocampal regions, showed an afferent connectivity profile. Finally, multimodal association nodes in lateral prefrontal brain regions demonstrated a short duration, bidirectional connectivity profile, consistent with this regions role in integrative and modulatory processing. These results provide novel insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of human brain function.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a linear operator for the purposes of quantifying the spectral properties of transport within resistive trees, such as airflow in lung airway networks. The operator, which we call the Maury matrix, acts only on the terminal nodes of the tree and is equivalent to the adjacency matrix of a complete graph summarising the relationships between all pairs of terminal nodes. We show that the eigenmodes of the Maury operator have a direct physical interpretation as the relaxation, or resistive, modes of the network. We apply these findings to both idealised and image-based models of ventilation in lung airway trees and show that the spectral properties of the Maury matrix characterise the flow asymmetry in these networks more concisely than the Laplacian modes, and that eigenvector centrality in the Maury spectrum is closely related to the phenomenon of ventilation heterogeneity caused by airway narrowing or obstruction. This method has applications in dimensionality reduction in simulations of lung mechanics, as well as for characterisation of models of the airway tree derived from medical images.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

We identified 5 main malignant subpopulations of OS cells, 3 clusters of osteoclast(OC) and 2 types of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Further we found that the progenitor OC and, antigen presenting CAF (apCAF) were lower in lung metastatic and recurrent tumor tissues than in primary tumor tissue. M2-like macrophages were predominant in the TME myeloid cells. Inactivation state of tumor-infiltrating T cells, mainly the CD4-/CD8-T and Treg cells, existed in lung metastatic tissues.

    "abstract": "Determining how pollinators visit plants versus how they carry and transfer pollen is an ongoing project in pollination ecology. The differences between how pollinators visit flowers versus how they carry pollen can be appreciable, but the current tools for identifying the pollens that bees carry have different strengths and weaknesses when used for ecological inference. In this study we use three methods to better understand a system of congeneric, co-flowering plants in the genus Clarkia and their bee pollinators: observations of plant-pollinator contact in the field, and two different molecular methods to estimate the relative abundance of each Clarkia pollen in samples collected from pollinators. We use these methods to investigate if observations of plant-pollinator contact in the field correspond to the pollen bees carry; if individual bees carry Clarkia pollens in predictable ways, based on previous knowledge of their foraging behaviors; and how the three approaches differ for understanding plant-pollinator interactions. We find that observations of plant-pollinator contact are generally predictive of the pollens that bees carry while foraging, and network topologies using the three different methods are statistically indistinguishable from each other. Results from molecular pollen analysis also show that while bees can carry multiple species of Clarkia at the same time, they often carry one species of pollen. Our work contributes to the growing body of literature aimed at resolving how pollinators use floral resources. We suggest our novel relative amplicon quantification method as another tool in the developing molecular ecology and pollination biology toolbox.",

Here, we use morphometric and phylogenetic comparative methods across fossil and extant squamates (\"lizards\" and snakes) to show they also repeatedly evolved increasingly complex teeth, but with more flexibility than mammals. Since the Late Jurassic, six major squamate groups independently evolved multiple-cusped teeth from a single-cusped common ancestor. Unlike mammals10,11, reversals to lower cusp numbers were frequent in squamates, with varied multiple-cusped morphologies in several groups resulting in heterogenous evolutionary rates. Squamate tooth complexity evolved in correlation with dietary change - increased plant consumption typically followed tooth complexity increases, and the major increases in speciation rate in squamate evolutionary history are associated with such changes. The evolution of complex teeth played a critical role in vertebrate evolution outside Mammalia, with squamates exemplifying a more labile system of dental- dietary evolution.",

    "abstract": "Both sex allocation and sexual conflict can be modulated by spatial structure. However, how the interplay between the type of dispersal and the scale of competition simultaneously affects these traits in sub-divided populations is rarely considered.\n\nWe investigated sex allocation and sexual conflict evolution in meta-populations of the spider mite Tetranychus urticae evolving under budding (pairing females from the same patch) or random (pairing females from different patches) dispersal and either local (fixed sampling from each subpopulation) versus global (sampling as a function of subpopulation productivity) competition.\n\nFemales evolving under budding dispersal produced less female-biased offspring sex ratios than those from the random dispersal selection regimes, contradicting theoretical predictions. In turn, the scale of competition did not have a strong effect on sex allocation. Males evolved under budding dispersal induced less female harm than those exposed to random dispersal, but there was no reduction in female fitness following exposure to multiple mates from either selection regime.\n\nThis work highlights that population structure can impact the evolution of sex allocation and sexual conflict. We also discuss how selection on either trait may reciprocally affect the evolution of the other, for example via effects on fecundity.",

    "abstract": "Massive gene flow between crops and their wild relatives may threaten the genetic integrity of wild species. Such threats are now well documented, but little is known about indirect consequences involving the spillover of crop pathogens to wild plants or introgression between crop and wild pathogens. To address these questions, we used population genetics approaches, demographic inference and pathogenicity tests on host-pathogen pairs composed of wild or domesticated apple trees of Central Asia and their fungal pathogen, Venturia inaequalis, itself showing differentiated agricultural-type and wild-type populations. We confirmed the occurrence of gene flow from cultivated to wild apple trees in Asian forests, threatening the Asian wild apple genetic integrity. SNP markers and demographic modeling revealed the occurrence of a secondary contact followed by hybridization between agricultural-type and wild-type fungal pathogen populations, and the dispersal of the agricultural-type pathogen in wild forests. We detected a SNP predicting the ability of the fungus to parasitize the different host populations, which induced an early stop codon in a gene coding for a small secreted protein in the agricultural-type fungal population, thus representing a putative avirulence gene which function loss would enable to parasitize cultivated apples. Pathogenicity tests in fact revealed the pestification of V. inaequalis, with higher virulence of the agricultural-type population on both wild and domesticated trees. Our findings highlight the threat posed by cultivating a crop near its center of origin, with the invasion of a pestified pathogen on wild plants and introgression in the wild-type pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of the evolutionary history of primates is undergoing continual revision due to ongoing genome sequencing efforts. Bolstered by growing fossil evidence, these data have led to increased acceptance of once controversial hypotheses regarding phylogenetic relationships, hybridization and introgression, and the biogeographical history of primate groups. Among these findings is a pattern of recent introgression between species within all major primate groups examined to date, though little is known about introgression deeper in time. To address this and other phylogenetic questions, here we present new reference genome assemblies for three Old World Monkey species: Colobus angolensis ssp. palliatus (the black and white colobus), Macaca nemestrina (southern pig-tailed macaque), and Mandrillus leucophaeus (the drill). We combine these data with 23 additional primate genomes to estimate both the species tree and individual gene trees using thousands of loci. While our species tree is largely consistent with previous phylogenetic hypotheses, the gene trees reveal high levels of genealogical discordance associated with multiple primate radiations. We use strongly asymmetric patterns of gene tree discordance around specific branches to identify multiple instances of introgression between ancestral primate lineages. In addition, we exploit recent fossil evidence to perform fossil-calibrated molecular dating analyses across the tree. Taken together, our genome-wide data help to resolve multiple contentious sets of relationships among primates, while also providing insight into the biological processes and technical artifacts that led to the disagreements in the first place.",

    "abstract": "One striking feature of the large KRAB-containing zinc finger protein (KZFP) family is its rapid expansion and divergence since its formation about 400 million years ago. However, the evolutionary characteristics of KRAB domains, C2H2 zinc fingers and the full protein of KZFPs have not been fully analyzed. As for the drivers of the rapid evolution, its partly due to their coevolution with transposable elements (TEs). But their diverse functions besides inhibiting TEs suggest other reasons exist. Here we address these two issues by the systematic analysis of the divergence time and diversification pattern of KZFPs at three aspects and the functional analysis of the potential target genes besides TEs. We found that old-zinc-finger-containing KZFPs tend to have varied and disordered KRAB domains, indicating there are two ways of the evolution of KZFPs, including the variation of KRAB domains and the diversification of zinc fingers. Among them, the divergence of zinc fingers mainly contributes to the rapid evolution of KZFPs. Thus, we mainly focused on the functional requirements of the evolution of zinc fingers. Different from the classical regulation pattern of this family, we found and experimentally confirmed that KZFPs tend to bind to non-TE regions and can positively regulate target genes. Although most young genes tend to be with a low expression level, young-zinc-finger-containing KZFPs tend to be highly expressed in early embryonic development or early mesoderm differentiation, indicating their particular evolutionarily novel functional roles in these two processes. We further validated a young KZFP, ZNF611, can bind to non-TE region of STK38 gene and positively regulates its expression in ESCs. The emergence of new sequence in STK38 promoter may drive the evolution of zinc fingers in ZNF611. Finally, we proposed a  two-way evolution model of KZFP family.",

    "abstract": "Genetic diversity within pathogen populations is critically important for predicting pathogen evolution, disease outcomes and prevalence. However, we lack a good understanding of the processes maintaining genetic variation and constraints on pathogen life-history evolution. Here, we analyzed interactions between 12 wheat host genotypes and 145 strains of Zymoseptoria tritici from five global populations to investigate the evolution and maintenance of variation in pathogen virulence and reproduction. We found a strong positive correlation between virulence and reproduction, with substantial variation in both traits maintained within each pathogen population. On average, highly virulent isolates exhibited higher fecundity, which might increase transmission potential in agricultural fields planted to homogeneous hosts at a high density. We further showed that pathogen strains with a narrow host range (i.e. specialists) for fecundity were on average less virulent, and those with a broader host range (i.e. generalists) for virulence were on average less fecund on a given specific host. These trade-offs costs associated with host specialization might constrain the directional evolution of virulence and fecundity. We conclude that selection favoring pathogen strains that are virulent across diverse hosts, coupled with selection that maximizes fecundity on specific hosts, may explain the maintenance of these pathogenicity traits within and among pathogen populations.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe incongruence of character states with phylogenetic relationships is often interpreted as evidence of convergent evolution. However, trait evolution along discordant gene trees can also generate these incongruences - a phenomenon known as hemiplasy. Classic phylogenetic comparative methods do not account for discordance, resulting in incorrect inferences about the number of times a trait has evolved, and therefore about convergence. Biological sources of discordance include incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and introgression, but only ILS has received theoretical consideration in the context of hemiplasy. Here, we derive expectations for the probabilities of hemiplasy and homoplasy with ILS and introgression acting simultaneously. We find that introgression makes hemiplasy more likely than ILS alone, suggesting that methods that account for discordance only due to ILS will be conservative. We also present a method for making statistical inferences about the relative probabilities of hemiplasy and homoplasy in empirical datasets. Our method is implemented in the software package HeIST (Hemiplasy Inference Simulation Tool), and estimates the most probable number of transitions among character states given a set of relationships with discordance. HeIST can accommodate ILS and introgression simultaneously, and can be applied to phylogenies where the number of taxa makes finding an analytical solution impractical. We apply this tool to two empirical cases of apparent trait convergence in the presence of high levels of discordance, one of which involves introgression between the convergent lineages. In both cases we find that hemiplasy is likely to contribute to the observed trait incongruences.",

This habit was historically viewed by an incidental outcome of unnaturally crowded laboratory situations with little ecological importance (Fox 1975), but it is increasingly acknowledged that cannibalism represents a potentially advantageous behavior (Richardson et al. 2010). Here we report on multiple cases of egg cannibalism, or conspecific oophagy, by adults of two species of passion vine (Passiflora Linnaeus: Passifloraceae) specialist flea beetles in the genus Disonycha Chevrolat (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Galerucinae: Alticini). This is the first report of egg cannibalism from the Galerucinae, and to our knowledge, only the fourth report of egg cannibalism by adults in the Chrysomelidae; the other three reports are of adult Chrysomelinae species eating conspecific eggs (Dickinson 1992; McCauley 1992; Schrod et al. 1996).

AEVs (and, less effectively, NEVs) of AD participants induced Membrane Attack Complex (MAC) expression on recipient neurons, membrane disruption, reduced neurite density, and decreased cell viability in rat cortical neurons and human IPSC-derived neurons. Neurodegenerative effects were not produced by multicellular-origin EVs from AD participants or AEVs/NEVs from FTLD or control participants, and were suppressed by the MAC inhibitor CD59 and other complement inhibitors.

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria form harmful mass blooms in freshwater and marine environments around the world. A range of secondary metabolites has been identified from cultures of cyanobacteria and biomass collected from cyanobacterial bloom events. A comprehensive database is necessary to correctly identify cyanobacterial metabolites and advance research on their abundance, persistence and toxicity in natural environments. We consolidated open access databases and manually curated missing information from the literature published between 1970 and March 2020. The result is the database CyanoMetDB, which includes more than 2000 entries based on more than 750 literature references. This effort has more than doubled the total number of entries with complete literature metadata and structural composition (SMILES codes) compared to publicly available databases to this date. Over the past decade, more than one hundred additional secondary metabolites have been identified yearly. We organized all entries into structural classes and conducted substructure searches of the provided SMILES codes. This approach demonstrated, for example, that 65% of the compounds carry at least one peptide bond, 57% are cyclic compounds, and 30% carry at least one halogen atom. Structural searches by SMILES code can be further specified to identify structural motifs that are relevant for analytical approaches, research on biosynthetic pathways, bioactivity-guided analysis, or to facilitate predictive science and modeling efforts on cyanobacterial metabolites. This database facilitates rapid identification of cyanobacterial metabolites from toxic blooms, research on the biosynthesis of cyanobacterial natural products, and the identification of novel natural products from cyanobacteria.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=125 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/038703v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3504f7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d92680org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6ea103org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10cd983_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "MotivationFacilitated by technological advances and expeditious decrease in the sequencing costs, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is increasingly implemented to uncover variations in cultivars/accessions of many crop plants. In tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), the availability of the genome sequence, followed by the resequencing of tomato cultivars and its wild relatives, has provided a prodigious resource for the improvement of traits. A high-quality genome resequencing of 84 tomato accessions and wild relatives generated a dataset that can be used as a resource to identify agronomically important alleles across the genome. Converting this dataset into a searchable database, including information about the influence of SNPs on protein function, provides valuable information about the genetic variations. The database will assist in searching for functional variants of a gene for introgression into tomato cultivars.\n\nResultsA recent release of better-quality tomato genome reference assembly SL3.0, and new annotation ITAG3.2 of SL3.0, dropped 3,857 genes, added 4,900 novel genes, and updated 20,766 genes. Using the above version, we remapped the data from the tomato lines resequenced under the \"100 Tomato Genome ReSequencing Project\" on new tomato genome assembly SL3.0 and made an online searchable Tomato Genomic Variations (TGV) database. The TGV contains information about SNPs and InDels and expands it by functional annotation of variants with new ITAG3.2 using SIFT4G software. This database with search function assists in inferring the influence of SNPs on the function of a target gene. This database can be used for selecting SNPs, which can be potentially deployed for improving tomato traits.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationTGV is freely available at http://psd.uohyd.ac.in/tgv.\n\nContactrameshwar.sharma@gmail.com",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe applicability and reproducibility of bioinformatics methods and results often depend on the structure and software architecture of their development. Exponentially growing data sets require ever more optimization and performance with conventional computing capacities lacking this process. This creates a large overhead for software development in a research area which is primarily interested in solving complex biological problems rather than developing new, performant software solutions. In pure computer science, new structures in the field of web development have produced more efficient processes for container-based software solutions. The advantages of these structures have rarely been explored in a broader scientific scale. This is also the case with the trend of migrating computations from on premise resources to the cloud.\n\nResultsWe created Bio-Node, a new platform for large scale bio data analysis utilizing cloud compute resources (publicly available at https://bio-node.de). Bio-Node enables building complex workflows using a sophisticated web interface. We applied Bio-Node to implement bioinformatic workflows for rapid metagenome function annotation. We further developed \"Auto-Clustering\", a workflow that automatically extracts the most suited clustering parameters for specific data types and subsequently enables to optimally segregate unknown samples of the same type. Compared to existing methods and approaches Bio-Node improves performance and costs of bioinformatics data analyses while providing an easier and faster development process with focus on reproducibility and reusability.\n\nSupplementary information is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3753146",

    "abstract": "One of the long-standing holy grails of molecular evolution has been the ability to predict an organisms fitness directly from its genotype. With such predictive abilities in hand, researchers would be able to more accurately forecast how organisms will evolve and how proteins with novel functions could be engineered, leading to revolutionary advances in medicine and biotechnology. In this work, we assemble the largest reported set of experimental TEM-1 {beta}-lactamase folding free energies and use this data in conjunction with previously acquired fitness data and computational free energy predictions to determine how much of the fitness of {beta}-lactamase can be directly predicted by thermodynamic folding and binding free energies. We focus upon {beta}-lactamase because of its long history as a model enzyme and its central role in antibiotic resistance. Based upon a set of 21 {beta}-lactamase single and double mutants expressly designed to influence protein folding, we first demonstrate that modeling software such as FoldX and PyRosetta designed to compute folding free energies can meaningfully, although not perfectly, predict the experimental folding free energies of single mutants. Interestingly, while these techniques also yield sensible double mutant free energies, we show that they do so for the wrong physical reasons. We then go on to assess how well both experimental and computational folding free energies explain single mutant fitness. We find that folding free energies account for, at most, 24% of the variance in {beta}-lactamase fitness values according to linear models and, somewhat surprisingly, complementing folding free energies with computationally-predicted binding free energies of residues near the active site only increases the folding-only figure by a few percent. This strongly suggests that the majority of {beta}-lactamases fitness is controlled by factors other than free energies. Overall, our results shed a bright light on to what extent the community is justified in using thermodynamic measures to infer protein fitness as well as how applicable modern computational techniques for predicting free energies will be to the large data sets of multiply-mutated proteins forthcoming.",

    "abstract": "Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) such as HPV16 and HPV18 can cause cancers of the cervix, vagina, vulva, penis, anus and oropharynx. Continuous expression of the HPV viral oncoproteins E6 and E7 are essential for transformation and maintenance of cancer cells. Therefore, therapeutic targeting of E6 and E7 genes can potentially be used to treat HPV-related cancers. Previous CRISPR/Cas9 studies on inactivation of E6 and E7 genes confirmed cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Here we report that CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout of E6 and E7 can also trigger cellular senescence in HPV18 immortalized HeLa cells. Specifically, HeLa cells in which E6 and E7 were inactivated exhibited characteristic senescence markers like enlarged cell and nucleus surface area, increased {beta}-galactosidase expression, and loss of lamin B1 with detection of cytoplasmic chromatin fragments. Furthermore, the knockout of HPV18 E6 and E7 proteins resulted in upregulation of p53/p21 and pRb/p21 levels in senescent cells. These senescent cells were devoid of characteristic apoptotic markers and re-introduction of codon-modified HPV18 E6 decreased p53 levels. Taken together, our study demonstrates that cellular senescence is as an alternative outcome of HPV oncogene inactivation by the CRISPR/Cas9 methodology.",

    "abstract": "Summary paragraphTo meet the ambitious objectives of biodiversity and climate conventions, countries and the international community require clarity on how these objectives can be operationalized spatially, and multiple targets be pursued concurrently1. To support governments and political conventions, spatial guidance is needed to identify which areas should be managed for conservation to generate the greatest synergies between biodiversity and natures contribution to people (NCP). Here we present results from a joint optimization that maximizes improvements in species conservation status, carbon retention and water provisioning and rank terrestrial conservation priorities globally. We found that, selecting the top-ranked 30% (respectively 50%) of areas would conserve 62.4% (86.8%) of the estimated total carbon stock and 67.8% (90.7%) of all clean water provisioning, in addition to improving the conservation status for 69.7% (83.8%) of all species considered. If priority was given to biodiversity only, managing 30% of optimally located land area for conservation may be sufficient to improve the conservation status of 86.3% of plant and vertebrate species on Earth. Our results provide a global baseline on where land could be managed for conservation. We discuss how such a spatial prioritisation framework can support the implementation of the biodiversity and climate conventions.",

    "abstract": "Social groups often consist of diverse phenotypes, including personality types, and this diversity is known to affect the functioning of the group as a whole. Social selection theory proposes that group composition (i.e. social environment) also influences the performance of individual group members. However, the effect of group behavioural composition on group members remains largely unexplored, and it is still contentious whether individuals benefit more in a social environment with homogeneous or diverse behavioural composition. We experimentally formed groups of house sparrows Passer domesticus with high and low diversity of personality (exploratory behaviour), and found that their physiological state (body condition, physiological stress and oxidative damage) improved with increasing group-level diversity of personality. These findings demonstrate that group personality composition affects the condition of group members and individuals benefit from social heterosis (i.e. associating with a diverse set of behavioural types). This aspect of the social life can play a key role in affiliation rules of social animals and might explain the evolutionary coexistence of different personalities in nature.",

    "abstract": "AimPredicting novel reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens would be improved by identifying inter-specific drivers of host competence, the ability to transmit pathogens to new hosts or vectors. Tick-borne pathogens can provide a useful model system, as larvae become infected only when feeding on a competent host during their first bloodmeal. For tick-borne diseases, competence has been best studied for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl), which causes Lyme borreliosis. Major reservoirs include several small mammal species, but birds may play an underrecognized role in human risk given their ability to disperse infected ticks across large spatial scales. Here, we provide a global synthesis of the ecological and evolutionary factors that determine the ability of bird species to infect larval ticks with Bbsl.\n\nLocationGlobal\n\nTime period1983 to 2019\n\nMajor taxa studiedBirds\n\nMethodsWe compiled a dataset of Bbsl competence across 183 bird species and applied meta-analysis, phylogenetic factorization, and boosted regression trees to describe spatial and temporal patterns in competence, characterize its phylogenetic distribution across birds, reconstruct its evolution, and evaluate the trait profiles associated with competent avian species.\n\nResultsHalf of sampled bird species show evidence of competence for Bbsl. Competence displays moderate phylogenetic signal, has evolved multiple times across bird species, and is pronounced in the genus Turdus. Trait-based analyses distinguished competent birds with 80% accuracy and show that such species have low baseline corticosterone, exist on both ends of the pace-of-life continuum, breed and winter at high latitudes, and have broad migratory movements into their breeding range. We use these trait profiles to predict various likely but unsampled competent species, including novel concentrations of avian reservoirs within the Neotropics.\n\nMain conclusionOur results can generate new hypotheses for how birds contribute to the dynamics of tick-borne pathogens and help prioritize surveillance of likely but unsampled competent birds. Our findings further emphasize that birds display underrecognized variation in their contributions to enzootic cycles of Bbsl and the broader need to better consider competence in ecological and predictive studies of multi-host pathogens.",

Capistrano in Managok Village both in Malaybalay City, Bukidnon. Using a nested sampling design, tree diameter at breast height as well as tree height were measured. Allometric equations were then used to calculate for the above and below ground biomass density of trees. Destructive sampling was then employed to determine the biomass density of understory and litterfall, while composite sampling was done for soil analysis. Carbon content was then used to compute for the carbon stock of the different carbon pools in the studied ecosystems. The average biomass density of the two areas was found to be 247.80 Mg ha-1 which are closely similar to other areas of the same forest type in Mindanao. Likewise the average carbon stock of the two areas is 143.14 MgC ha-1 which is similar to tree plantations based on previous studies. Furthermore, the said carbon stock is approximately 40% lower than the country average for natural forests (250 MgC ha-1). The results demonstrate the extent of the diminishing carbon sequestration capability of forest areas due to human disturbance.",

We combined analyses of diversification rates with interaction network descriptors from 468 bird species belonging to 29 seed-dispersal networks to show that bird species that contribute most to the network structure of plant-frugivorous interactions belong to lineages that show higher macroevolutionary stability. This association is stronger in warmer, wetter, less seasonal environments. We infer that the macroevolutionary sorting mechanism acts through the regional pool of species by sorting species based on the available relative differences in diversification rates, rather than absolute rates. Our results illustrate how the interplay between interaction patterns and diversification dynamics may shape the organization and long-term dynamics of ecological networks.",

In the migratory songbird yellow warbler (Setophaga petechia), we find a correlation between individual-level wintering and breeding precipitation but not temperature. Birds wintering in the driest regions of the Neotropics breed in the driest regions of North America. Individuals from drier regions also possess distinct morphologies and population responses to varying rainfall. We find a positive association between bill size and breeding season precipitation which, given documented climate-associated genomic variation, might reflect adaptation to local precipitation regimes. Relative abundance in the breeding range is linked to interannual fluctuations in precipitation, but the directionality of this response varies across geography. Together, our results suggest that variation in climate optima may exist across the breeding range of yellow warblers and provide a mechanism for selection across the annual cycle.",

    "abstract": "Lack of divergence in mitochondrial DNA between species with clear phenotypic differences may be the result of low resolution of markers, incomplete lineage sorting, introgression, or the interplay of various evolutionary mechanisms acting on different traits and genomic regions through time. Previous work revealed that the Andean hummingbirds Coeligena bonapartei and C. helianthea lack genetic divergence in the mitochondrial ND2 gene, which shows variation discordant with coloration phenotype but consistent with geography. We sequenced and analyzed complete mitochondrial genomes for C. b. bonapartei, C. b. consita, C. h. helianthea and C. h. tamai to assess whether patterns revealed by ND2 analyses hold when considering the entire mitogenome, and to shed light into the evolutionary history of these hummingbirds. We found very low genetic differentiation in mitogenomes among the four lineages of Coeligena, confirming patterns based on ND2 data. Estimates of genetic differentiation, phylogenies and haplotype network analyses of complete mitogenomes did not separate phenotypically distinct taxa, but were consistent with a previously described pattern of northern vs. southern divergence along the Cordillera Oriental of Colombia. Mitogenomes of C. b. bonapartei and C. h. helianthea are indistinguishable, suggesting incomplete lineage sorting or strong introgression. Mitogenomes of C. b. consita and C. h. tamai are slightly differentiated, but they are more similar to each other than either is to that of its respective nominate subspecies, a result also suggestive of mtDNA introgression despite distinct phenotypic differences. Our results indicate that various evolutionary mechanisms playing out over a complex biogeographic scenario in the Colombian Andes drove divergence in phenotypes and mitochondrial genomes of Coeligena hummingbirds, and lead to alternative hypotheses to be tested with whole-genome analyses.",

    "abstract": "Despite their ecological and evolutionary importance as key components of tropical ecosystems, the phylogeny of fig trees is still unresolved. We use restriction-site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing (ca 420kb) and 102 morphological characters to elucidate the relationships between 70 species of Ficus representing all known subgenera and sections and five outgroups. We compare morphological and molecular results to highlight discrepancies and reveal possible inference bias. We analyse marker and taxon properties that may bias molecular inferences, with existing softwares and a new approach based on iterative principal component analysis to reduce variance between clusters of samples. For the first time, with both molecular and morphological data, we recover a monophyletic subgenus Urostigma and a clade with all gynodioecious fig trees. However, our analyses show that it is not possible to homogenize evolutionary rates and GC content for all taxa prior to phylogenetic inference and that four competing positions for the root of the molecular tree are possible. The placement of the long-branched section Pharmacosycea as sister to all other fig trees is not supported by morphological data and considered as a result of a long branch attraction artefact to the outgroups. Regarding morphological features and indirect evidence from the pollinator tree of life, the topology that divides the genus Ficus into monoecious versus gynodioecious species appears most likely. Active pollination is inferred as the ancestral state for all topologies, ambiguity remains for ancestral breeding system including for the favored topology, and it appears most likely that the ancestor of fig trees was a freestanding tree. Increasing sampling may improve results and would be at least as relevant as maximizing the number of sequenced regions given the strong heterogeneity in evolutionary rates, and to a lesser extent, base composition among species. Despite morphological plasticity and frequent homoplasy of multiple characters, we advocate giving a central role to morphology in our understanding of the evolution of Ficus, especially as it can help detect insidious systematic errors that tend to become more pronounced with larger molecular data sets.",

    "abstract": "In the Lesser Antilles the Ringed Kingfisher Megaceryle torquata stictipennis is found on Martinique, Dominica and Guadeloupe. On Martinique and Guadeloupe, farmers growing bananas have made massive use of chlordecone from 1973 until 1993. Chlordecone is a remnant organochlorine insecticide which bioaccumulates in organisms easily. We carried out a survey of the Ringed Kingfisher in 2009 on Basse-Terre, Guadeloupe, traveling 270 km on 44 rivers to assess the effects of chlordecone on its habitat selection behaviour. We recorded 47 encounters of Ringed Kingfishers over the survey. A habitat selection analysis revealed that the Ringed Kingfishers were located mainly in sections of rivers flowing through the ombrophilous forest, but absent on the ocean shoreline or in the lower parts of rivers. The Ringed Kingfishers distribution on Guadeloupe could be negatively associated with areas heavily polluted by the chlordecone. We propose that the widespread use of chlordecone in banana plantations on Guadeloupe between 1973 and 1993 has adverse ecological consequences, and may be responsible for the absence of Ringed Kingfishers in lowland habitat on the island.\n\nResumeDans les Petites Antilles, le Martin-pecheur a ventre roux Megaceryle torquata stictipennis ne vit que sur trois iles: Martinique, Dominique et Guadeloupe. En 2009, nous avons effectue un recensement en Guadeloupe, sur 270 km parcourus dans 44 rivieres. Douze territoires de Martin-pecheur a ventre roux ont ete trouves, et la taille totale de la population est estimee a 54-64 individus. Une analyse de la selection de lhabitat montre que le Martin-pecheur a ventre roux se trouvait principalement sur les rivieres dans la foret ombrophile et non pas sur le bord de locean ni dans la partie basse des rivieres. En Guadeloupe, le Martin -pecheur a ventre roux est negativement associe avec les surfaces hautement polluees par un insecticide organochlore, la chlordecone. Nous suggerons que lepandage massif de la chlordecone de 1973 a 1993, dans les bananeraies de Guadeloupe, doit etre grandement responsable de labsence du Martin-pecheur a ventre roux dans les habitats de basses altitudes de lile.\n\nResumenEn las Antillas Menores, el Martin Gijante Neotropical Megaceryle torquata stictipennis solo vive en tres islas: Martinica, Santo Domingo y Guadalupe.

En Guadalupe, el Martin Gijante Neotropical esta negativamente asociado con las superficies muy poluadas por un insecticida organicloro, la chlordecona.

Although RNAs can be either enriched or depleted from SGs, the rules that dictate RNA partitioning into SGs are unknown. We demonstrate that the SG-enriched NORAD RNA is sufficient to enrich a reporter RNA within SGs through the combined effects of multiple elements. Moreover, artificial tethering of G3BP1 or TIA1 can target mRNAs into SGs in a dose-dependent manner that suggests individual protein interactions have small effects on the SG partitioning of mRNPs, which is supported by the observation that the SG transcriptome is largely unchanged in cell lines lacking the abundant SG RNA-binding proteins G3BP1 and G3BP2. We suggest the targeting of RNPs into SGs is due to a summation of potential RNA-protein, protein-protein, and RNA-RNA interactions with no single interaction dominating RNP recruitment into SGs.",

    "abstract": "Hearing and balance deficits have been reported during and following treatment with the antimalarial drug chloroquine. However, experimental work examining the direct actions of chloroquine on mechanoreceptive hair cells in common experimental models is lacking. This study examines the effects of chloroquine on hair cells using two common experimental models: the zebrafish lateral line and neonatal mouse cochlear cultures. Zebrafish larvae were exposed to varying concentrations of chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine for 1 hr or 24 hr, and hair cells assessed by antibody staining. A significant, dose-dependent reduction in the number of surviving hair cells was seen across conditions for both exposure periods. Hydroxycholroquine showed similar toxicity. In mouse cochlear cultures, chloroquine damage was specific to outer hair cells in tissue from the cochlear basal turn, consistent with susceptibility to other ototoxic agents. These findings suggest a need for future studies employing hearing and balance monitoring during exposure to chloroquine and related compounds, particularly with interest in these compounds as therapeutics against viral infections including coronavirus.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the decision process underlying gaze control is an important question in cognitive neuroscience with applications in diverse fields ranging from psychology to computer vision. The decision for choosing an upcoming saccade target can be framed as a dilemma: Should the observer further exploit the information near the current gaze position or continue with exploration of other patches within the given scene? While several models attempt to describe the dynamics of saccade target selection, none of them explicitly addresses the underlying Exploration-Exploitation dilemma. Here we propose and investigate a mathematical model motivated by the Exploration-Exploitation dilemma in scene viewing. The model is derived from a minimal set of assumptions that generates realistic eye movement behavior. We implemented a Bayesian approach for model parameter inference based on the models likelihood function. In order to simplify the inference, we applied data augmentation methods that allowed the use of conjugate priors and the construction of an efficient Gibbs sampler. This approach turned out to be numerically efficient and permitted fitting interindividual differences in saccade statistics. Thus, the main contribution of our modeling approach is two-fold; first, we propose a new model for saccade generation in scene viewing. Second, we demonstrate the use of novel methods from Bayesian inference in the field of scan path modeling.\n\nAuthor summaryThe Exploration-Exploitation dilemma is general concept that has been investigated in human information processing. We investigate whether the Exploration-Exploitation trade-off is a viable approach to model sequences of fixations generated by a human observer in a free viewing task with natural scenes. Variants of the basic model are used to predict to the experimental data based on Bayesian inference. Results indicate a high predictive power for both aggregated data and individual differences across observers. The combination of a novel model with state-of-the-art Bayesian methods lends support to the Exploration-Exploitation framework in the field of eye-movement research.",

    "abstract": "Gymnosporia senegalensis is a shrub belonging to the Celastraceae family, which is native to tropical savannahs. Its only European populations are distributed discontinuously along the south-eastern coast of the Iberian Peninsula, forming plant communities with great ecological value, unique in Europe. As it is an endangered species that makes up plant communities with great palaeoecological significance, the development of species distribution models is of major interest under different climatic scenarios, past, present and future, based on the fact that the climate could play a relevant role in the distribution of this species as well as in the conformation of the communities in which it is integrated. Palaeoecological models were generated for the Maximum Interglacial, Last Maximum Glacial and Middle Holocene periods. The results obtained showed that the widest distribution of this species, and the maximum suitability of its habitat, occurred during the Last Glacial Maximum, when the temperatures of the peninsular southeast were not as contrasting as those of the rest of the European continent and were favored by higher rainfall. Under these conditions, large territories could act as shelters during the glacial period, a hypothesis reflected in the models results for this period, which exhibit a further expansion of G. senegalensis ecological niche. The future projection of models in around 2070, for four Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) according to the fifth report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC, showed that the most favorable areas for this species would be Campo de Dalias (southern portion of Almeria province) as it presents the bioclimatic characteristics of greater adjustment to G. senegalensis ecological niche model. Currently, these areas are almost totally destroyed and heavily altered by intensive agriculture under plastic, also causing a severe fragmentation of the habitat, which implies a prospective extinction scenario in the near future.",

    "abstract": "Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) in large human cohorts have identified thousands of loci associated with complex traits and diseases. For identifying the genes and gene-associated variants that underlie complex traits in livestock, especially where sample sizes are limiting, it may help to integrate the results of GWAS for equivalent traits in humans as prior information. In this study, we sought to investigate the usefulness of results from a GWAS on human height as prior information for identifying the genes and gene-associated variants that affect stature in cattle, using GWAS summary data on samples sizes of 700,000 and 58,265 for humans and cattle, respectively. Using Fishers exact test, we observed a significant proportion of cattle stature-associated genes (30/77) that are also associated with human height (odds ratio = 5.1, p = 3.1e-10). Result of randomized sampling tests showed that cattle orthologs of human height-associated genes, hereafter referred to as candidate genes (C-genes), were more enriched for cattle stature GWAS signals than random samples of genes in the cattle genome (p=0.01). Randomly sampled SNPs within the C-genes also tend to explain more genetic variance for cattle stature (up to 13.2%) than randomly sampled SNPs within random cattle genes (p=0.09). The most significant SNPs from a cattle GWAS for stature within the C-genes did not explain more genetic variance for cattle stature than the most significant SNPs within random cattle genes (p=0.87). Altogether, our findings support previous studies that suggest a similarity in the genetic regulation of height across mammalian species. However, with the availability of a powerful GWAS for stature that combined data from 8 cattle breeds, prior information from human-height GWAS does not seem to provide any additional benefit with respect to the identification of genes and gene-associated variants that affect stature in cattle.\n\nAuthor SummaryProvided that there is a similarity in the biological control of complex traits in different species, the results of genome-wide association study for a given trait in a model species can be utilized as prior information to identify genes and gene-associated variants that affect the same trait in a non-model species. Here we report that the number of genes found to be affecting height in both humans and cattle is more than can be expected by chance, suggesting a similarity in the biology of height in both species. In addition, genes that are associated with height in humans were found to be highly enriched with variants that are strongly associated with height in cattle. Using height as a model trait, we demonstrated that across-species prior information cannot compete with a within-species prior information, with respect to the identification of genes and the gene-associated variants that affect a complex trait. Across-species prior information can be useful, however, when within-species prior information is either unavailable or poor.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the genomic background of the Garfagnina (GRF) goat breed that faces the risk of extinction. In total, 48 goats genotyped with the Illumina CaprineSNP50 BeadChip were analyzed together with 214 goats belonging to 9 Italian breeds (~25 goats/breed) from the AdaptMap project [Argentata (ARG), Bionda dellAdamello (BIO), Ciociara Grigia (CCG), Di Teramo (DIT), Garganica (GAR), Girgentana (GGT), Orobica (ORO), Valdostana (VAL) and Valpassiria (VSS)]. We estimated i) runs of homozygosity (ROH), ii) admixture ancestries and iii) traceability success via discriminant analysis on principal components (DAPC) based on cross-validation. For GRF, an excess of frequent ROH (more than 45% in the GRF samples analyzed) was detected on CHR 12 at, roughly 50.25-50.94Mbp (ARS1 assembly), spanned between the CENPJ (centromere protein) and IL17D (interleukin 17D) genes. The same area was also present in DIT, while the broader region (~49.25-51.94Mbp) was shared among the ARG, CCG, and GGT. Admixture analysis depicted the uniqueness of the GRF breed, with a small part of common ancestry shared with BIO, VSS, ARG and CCG breeds. The DAPC model resulted in a 100% assignment success. We hope this work will contribute to the efforts of preventing the GRF from extinction and to add value to all the socio-agro-economic factors related with the farming of the GRF breed.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAn endometrial sampling procedure is a gold standard for the diagnostic evaluation of women with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) with primary aim to identify the cause, especially to determine whether carcinoma or premalignant lesions are present. The objective of the study is therefore to review endometrial biopsy specimen histopathological findings and associated factors at a tertiary referral hospital in urban Ethiopia.\n\nMethodologyThis is a two years retrospective analysis of cases of patients for whom endometrial biopsy was taken at a territory referral hospital in urban Ethiopia. Odds ratios, 95% confidence interval and p-value set at 0.05 were used to determine the statistical significance of the associations.\n\nResultsA total of 277 patient records were analyzed and mean and the median age of the study patients were 41.89 and 40.00 years respectively. The commonest histopathologic finding was endometrial polyp 66 (23.83%), followed by proliferative endometrium 47 (16.97%) and secretory endometrium 25(9.03%). Endometrial hyperplasia, endometrial malignancy, and pregnancy complications were reported in 9 (3.25%), 13 (4.69%), and 25 (9.03%) of cases respectively. Endometritis was detected in 20(7.22%), while Tuberculous (TB) endometritis was reported in 3(1.08%) of cases only. Inconclusive and inadequate sample was reported in 30 (10.83%) and 34 (12.27%) of cases respectively. Endometrial polyp was associated with 40-49 years of age (OR= 12.56, 95% CI: 2.58-61.23).\n\nConclusionsEndometrial polyp was the commonest histopathologic finding followed by proliferative and secretory endometrium respectively. Rate of sample inadequacy is higher than most of the study reports which mandates to improve sampling technique to increase sample adequacy and routine transvaginal ultrasound for endometrial evaluation especially for those postmenopausal women to decide the necessity of endometrial sampling.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety disorders (AD) are the most common mental illnesses affecting an estimated 40 million adults in the United States. Amiloride, a diuretic agent, has shown efficacy in treating AD in preclinical models by inhibiting the acid-sensing ion channels (ASIC). By delivering amiloride via nasal route, rapid onset of action can be achieved due to direct \"nose-to-brain\" access. Therefore, this study reports the formulation, physical, chemical, and microbiological stability of an extemporaneously prepared amiloride 2 mg/mL nasal spray. The amiloride nasal spray was prepared by adding 100 mg of amiloride hydrochloride to 50 mL of sterile water for injection in a sterile reagent bottle. A stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was developed and validated. Forced-degradation studies were performed to confirm the ability of the HPLC method to identify the degradation products from amiloride distinctively. The physical stability of the amiloride nasal spray was assessed by pH, clarity, and viscosity assessments. For chemical stability studies, samples of nasal sprays stored at room temperature were collected at time-points 0, 3 hr., 24 hr., and 7 days and were assayed in triplicate using the stability-indicating HPLC method. Microbiological stability of the nasal spray solution was evaluated for up to 7 days based on the sterility test outlined in United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) chapter 71. The stability-indicting HPLC method identified the degradation products of amiloride without interference from amiloride. All tested solutions retained over 90% of the initial amiloride concentration for the 7-day study period. There were no changes in color, pH, and viscosity in any sample. The nasal spray solutions were sterile for up to 7 days in all samples tested. An extemporaneously prepared nasal spray solution of amiloride hydrochloride (2 mg/mL) was physically, chemically, and microbiologically stable for 7 days when stored at room temperature.",

    "abstract": "Following the death due to cardiac arrest of a patient taking pimozide, sertraline and aripiprazole antipsychotic/antidepressant combination therapy, a role of drug-drug interaction was suggested. Here, we investigated P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated interaction among the three drugs using in vitro methods. Sertraline or aripiprazole significantly increased the permeability of pimozide in Caco-2 cell monolayers. ATPase assay indicated that pimozide is a P-gp substrate, and might act as a P-gp inhibitor at higher concentrations. The values of the kinetic parameters of carrier-mediated efflux, calculated from the concentration dependence of pimozide efflux from LLC-GA5-COL150 cells expressing human P-gp, were as follows: maximum transport rate (Jmax) = 84.9 {+/-} 8.9 pmol/min/mg protein, half-saturation concentration (Kt) = 10.6 {+/-} 4.7 M, first-order rate constant (kd) = 0.67 {+/-} 0.14 pmol/min/mg protein. Further, the efflux ratio of pimozide in LLC-GA5-COL150 cells was significantly decreased in the presence of sertraline or aripiprazole. These results indicate that pimozide is a substrate of P-gp, and its efflux is inhibited by sertraline and aripiprazole. Thus, P-gp inhibition by sertraline and/or aripiprazole may alter the gastrointestinal permeability of co-administered pimozide, resulting in an increased blood concentration of pimozide, which may increase the likelihood of pimozides known life-threatening side effect of QT prolongation.",

Exosomes have been investigated both for their biological roles and their possible use as disease biomarkers and drug carriers. These potential technological applications require the rigorous characterization of exosomal blood brain barrier permeability and a description of their lipid bilayer composition. To achieve these goals, we have established a 3D static blood brain barrier system based on existing systems for liposomes and a complementary LC-MS/MS and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance methodology for the analysis of purified human plasma-derived exosome-like vesicles. Results show that the isolated vesicles pass the blood brain barrier and are taken up in endothelial cells. The compositional analysis revealed that the isolated vesicles are enriched in lyso phospholipids and do not contain phosphatidylserine. These findings deviate significantly from the composition of exosomes originating from cell culture, and may reflect active removal by macrophages that respond to exposed phosphahtidylserine.",

As transcription is a time-dependent process, it is expected that gene expression will be inversely related to gene length, and this is found to be the case. Here I describe the results of studies performed with the human genome to test whether the gene length/gene expression linkage is affected by two factors, the chromosome where the gene is located and the tissue where it is expressed.\n\nExperimental designStudies were carried out with a database of 2413 human genes that were divided into short, mid-length and long groups. Each of the 24 human chromosomes was then characterized according to the proportion of each gene length group present. A similar analysis was performed with 19 human tissues. The proportion of short, mid-length and long genes was noted for each tissue.\n\nResultsBoth chromosome and tissue studies revealed new information about the role of gene length in control of gene expression. Chromosome studies led to the identification of two chromosome populations that differ in the level of short gene expression. Tissue studies support the conclusion that short, highly expressed genes are enriched in tissues that produce protein products that are exported from the host cell.",

Few studies have explored how changing geochemical conditions influence the composition of groundwater microbial communities over time. We temporally monitored alterations in abiotic forces on microbial community structure using 1L in-field bioreactors receiving background and contaminated groundwater at the Oak Ridge Reservation, TN. Planktonic and biofilm microbial communities were initialized with background water for 4 days to establish communities in triplicate control reactors and triplicate test reactors and then fed filtered water for 14 days. On day 18, three reactors were switched to receive filtered groundwater from a contaminated well, enriched in total dissolved solids relative to the background site, particularly chloride, nitrate, uranium, and sulfate. Biological and geochemical data were collected throughout the experiment, including planktonic and biofilm DNA for 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, cell counts, total protein, anions, cations, trace metals, organic acids, bicarbonate, pH, Eh, DO, and conductivity. We observed significant shifts in both planktonic and biofilm microbial communities receiving contaminated water. This included a loss of rare taxa, especially amongst members of the Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Betaproteobacteria, but enrichment in the Fe- and nitrate-reducing Ferribacterium and parasitic Bdellovibrio. These shifted communities were more similar to the contaminated well community, suggesting that geochemical forces substantially influence microbial community diversity and structure. These influences can only be captured through such comprehensive temporal studies, which also enable more robust and accurate predictive models to be developed.",

Apricots are outstanding summer fruits, with their beautiful attractive colour, delicious sweet taste, aroma and high vitamin and mineral content. In the current study, a total of 259 apricot genotypes from different geographical origins in Turkey were used. Significant variations were detected in fruit firmness (FF), fruit flesh color (FFC), flowering time (FT), and soluble solid content (SSC). A total of 11,532 SNPs based on DArT were developed and used in the analyses of population structure and association mapping (AM). According to the STRUCTURE (v.2.2) analysis, the apricot genotypes were divided into three groups. The mixed linear model with Q and K matrixes were used to detect the associations between the SNPs and four traits. A total of 131 SNPs were associated with FF, FFC, and SSC. The results demonstrated that AM had high potential of revealing the markers associated with economically important traits in apricot.",
