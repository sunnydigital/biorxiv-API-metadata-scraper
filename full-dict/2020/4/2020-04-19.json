    "abstract": "Synaptic vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane to release neurotransmitter following an action potential, after which new vesicles must  dock to refill vacated release sites. To capture synaptic vesicle exocytosis at cultured mouse hippocampal synapses, we induced single action potentials by electrical field stimulation then subjected neurons to high-pressure freezing to examine their morphology by electron microscopy. During synchronous release, multiple vesicles can fuse at a single active zone; this multivesicular release is augmented by increasing extracellular calcium. Fusions during synchronous release are distributed throughout the active zone, whereas fusions during asynchronous release are biased toward the center of the active zone. Immediately after stimulation, the total number of docked vesicles across all synapses decreases by [~]40%. Between 8 and 14 ms, new vesicles are recruited to the plasma membrane and fully replenish the docked pool in a calcium-dependent manner, but docking of these vesicles is transient and they either undock or fuse within 100 ms. These results demonstrate that recruitment of synaptic vesicles to release sites is rapid and reversible.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWI provide a general framework for linking ecology and evolution. I start from the fact that individuals require energy, trace molecules, water, and mates to survive and reproduce, and that phenotypic resource accrual traits determine an individuals ability to detect and acquire these resources. Optimum resource accrual traits, and their values, are determined by the dynamics of resources, aspects of the environment that hinder resource detection and acquisition by imposing risks of mortality and reproductive failure, and the energetic costs of developing and maintaining the traits - part of an individuals energy budget. These budgets also describe how individuals utilize energy by partitioning it into maintenance, development and/or reproduction at each age and size, age and size at sexual maturity, and the size and number of offspring produced at each reproductive event. The optimum energy budget is consequently determined by the optimum life history strategy that describes how resources are utilized to maximize fitness by trading off investments in maintenance, development, and reproductive output at each age and size. The optimum life history in turn determines body size. An eco-evolutionary feedback loop occurs when resource accrual traits evolve to impact the quality and quantity of resources that individuals accrue, resulting in a new optimum life history strategy and energy budget required to deliver it, a change in body size, and altered population dynamics that, in turn, impact the resource base. These feedback loops can be complex, but can be studied by examining the eco-evolutionary journey of communities from one equilibrium state to another following a perturbation to the environment.",

    "abstract": "PurposeWe aimed to develop a non-invasive neural test of language comprehension to use with non-speaking children for whom standard behavioural testing is unreliable (e.g., minimally-verbal autism). Our aims were three-fold. First, we sought to establish the sensitivity of two auditory paradigms to elicit neural responses in individual neurotypical children. Second, we aimed to validate the use of a portable and accessible electroencephalography (EEG) system, by comparing its recordings to those of a research-grade system. Third, in light of substantial inter-individual variability in individuals neural responses, we assessed whether multivariate decoding methods could improve sensitivity.\n\nMethodsWe tested the sensitivity of two child-friendly covert N400 paradigms. Thirty-one typically developing children listened to identical spoken words that were either strongly predicted by the preceding context or violated lexical-semantic expectations. Context was given by a cue word (Experiment 1) or sentence frame (Experiment 2) and participants either made an overall judgement on word relatedness or counted lexical-semantic violations. We measured EEG concurrently from a research-grade system, Neuroscans SynAmps2, and an adapted gaming system, Emotivs EPOC+.\n\nResultsWe found substantial inter-individual variability in the timing and topology of N400-like effects. For both paradigms and EEG systems, traditional N400 effects at the expected sensors and time points were statistically significant in around 50% of individuals. Using multivariate analyses, detection rate increased to 88% of individuals for the research-grade system in the sentences paradigm, illustrating the robustness of this method in the face of inter-individual variations in topography.\n\nConclusionsThere was large inter-individual variability in neural responses, suggesting inter-individual variation in either the cognitive response to lexical-semantic violations, and/or the neural substrate of that response. Around half of our neurotypical participants showed the expected N400 effect at the expected location and time point. A low-cost, accessible EEG system provided comparable data for univariate analysis but was not well suited to multivariate decoding. However, multivariate analyses with a research-grade EEG system increased our detection rate to 88% of individuals. This approach provides a strong foundation to establish a neural index of language comprehension in children with limited communication.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSchizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorders (BD) share substantial neurodevelopmental components affecting brain maturation and architecture. This necessitates a dynamic lifespan perspective in which brain aberrations are inferred from deviations from expected lifespan trajectories. We applied machine learning to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) indices of white matter structure and organization to estimate and compare brain age between patients with SZ, BD, and healthy controls across 10 cohorts.\n\nMethodsWe trained six cross-validated models using different combinations of DTI data from 927 healthy controls (HC, 18-94 years), and applied the models to the test sets including 648 SZ (18-66 years) patients, 185 BD patients (18-64 years), and 990 HC (17-68 years), estimating brain age for each participant. Group differences were assessed using linear models, accounting for age, sex, and scanner. A meta-analytic framework was applied to assess the heterogeneity and generalizability of the results.\n\nResults10-fold cross-validation revealed high accuracy for all models. Compared to controls, the model including all feature sets significantly over-estimated the age of patients with SZ (d=-.29) and BD (d=.18), with similar effects for the other models. The meta-analysis converged on the same findings. Fractional anisotropy (FA) based models showed larger group differences than the models based on other DTI-derived metrics.\n\nConclusionsBrain age prediction based on DTI provides informative and robust proxies for brain white matter integrity. Our results further suggest that white matter aberrations in SZ and BD primarily consist of anatomically distributed deviations from expected lifespan trajectories that generalize across cohorts and scanners.",

To investigate a possible reason for this, we treated cancer cells with KRAS inhibitors deltarasin (targeting phosphodiesterase-{delta}), cysmethynil (targeting isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase), and AA12 (targeting KRASG12C), and silenced/overexpressed mutant KRAS using custom vectors. We show that KRAS-mutant tumor cells exclusively respond to KRAS blockade in vivo, because the oncogene co-opts host myeloid cells via a C-C-motif chemokine ligand 2/interleukin-1{beta} signaling loop for sustained tumorigenicity. Indeed, KRAS-mutant tumors did not respond to deltarasin in Ccr2 and Il1b gene-deficient mice, but were deltarasin-sensitive in wild-type and Ccr2-deficient mice adoptively transplanted with wild-type murine bone marrow. A KRAS-dependent pro-inflammatory transcriptome was prominent in human cancers with high KRAS mutation prevalence and predicted poor survival. Hence the findings support that in vitro systems are suboptimal for anti-KRAS drug screens, and suggest that interleukin-1{beta} blockade might be specific for KRAS-mutant cancers.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTUterine leiomyomas (ULs) constitute a considerable health burden in the general female population. The fumarate hydratase (FH) deficient subtype is found in up to 1.6% and can occur in hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) syndrome.We sequenced 13 FH deficient ULs from a previous immunohistochemical screen using a targeted panel and identified biallelic FH variants in all. In eight, we found a FH point mutation (two truncating, six missense) with evidence for loss of the second allele. Variant allele-frequencies in all cases with a point mutation pointed to somatic variants. Spatial clustering of the identified missense variants in the lyase domain indicated altered fumarase oligomerization with subsequent degradation as explanation for the observed FH deficiency. Biallelic FH deletions in five tumors confirm the importance of copy number loss as mutational mechanism.By curating all pathogenic FH variants and calculating their population frequency, we estimate a carrier frequency of up to 1/2,563. Comparing with the prevalence of FH deficient ULs, we conclude that most are sporadic and estimate 2.7 - 13.9% of females with an FH deficient UL to carry a germline FH variant.Further prospective tumor/normal sequencing studies are needed to develop a reliable screening strategy for HLRCC in women with ULs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile parts of the genome that can jump or self-replicate, posing a threat to the stability and integrity of the host genome. TEs are prevented from causing damage to the host genome by defense mechanisms such as nuclear silencing, where TE transcripts are targeted for degradation in an RNAi-like fashion. These pathways are well characterised in model organisms but very little is known about them in other species. Parasitic flatworms present an opportunity to investigate evolutionary novelties in TE control because they lack canonical pathways identified in model organisms (such as the piRNA pathways) but have conserved central players such as Dicer and Ago (argonaute) enzymes. Notably, parasitic flatworm Ago proteins are phylogenetically distinct from classical Ago, raising the question of whether they play special roles in these organisms. In this report, we investigate the role of Ago proteins in the parasitic flatworm Schistosoma mansoni. We show that transcript abundance of two retrotransposable elements increases upon silencing of S. mansoni Ago genes. We further demonstrate that SmAgo2 protein is primarily localised in the germ line of adult worms and its sub-cellular localisation is both nuclear and cytoplasmic. These findings provide further evidence of active TE control under a yet not fully unveiled pathway.",

In order to better predict and understand the future of these organisms all the tools of modern biology are needed today. However, many NGS based approaches are not feasible in corals because of the lack of reference genomes. Therefore we have sequenced, de novo assembled, and annotated, the draft genome of one of the most studied coral species, Pocillopora acuta (ex damicornis). The sequencing strategy was based on four libraries with complementary insert size and sequencing depth (180pb, 100x; 3Kb, 25x; 8kb, 12x and 20 kb, 12x). The de novo assembly was performed with Platanus (352 Mb; 25,553 scaffolds; N50 171,375 bp). 36,140 genes were annotated by RNA-seq data and 64,558 by AUGUSTUS (Hidden-Markov model). Gene functions were predicted through Blast and orthology based approaches. This new genomic resource will enable the development of a large array of genome wide studies but also shows that the de novo assembly of a coral genome is now technically feasible and economically realistic.",

Based on the data in The Cancer Genome Atlas, we found that most ferroptosis regulator genes (FRGs) were differentially expressed in tumors, copy number alterations (CNA) and DNA methylation contributed to their aberrant expression. We established the ferroptosis potential index (FPI) to reveal the functional roles of ferroptosis and noticed that the FPI was higher in tumors than in normal tissues in most cancers, and was associated with subtypes and clinical features. The FPI was negatively correlated with several metabolism pathways but positively associated with several important metastasis-related pathways and immune-related pathways. Higher FPI predicted worse prognosis in several tumors, while FPI and FRGs impacted drug sensitivity. Our study presents a systematical analysis of ferroptosis and its regulatory genes, and highlights the potential of ferroptosis-based cancer therapy.",

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance (rsfMRI) work has revealed changes in static connectivity related to age, sex, cognitive abilities and psychiatric symptoms, yet little is known how these factors may alter the information flow. The commonly used approach infers functional brain connectivity using stationary coefficients yielding static estimates of the undirected connection strength between brain regions. Dynamic graphical models (DGMs) are a multivariate model with dynamic coefficients reflecting directed temporal associations between nodes, and can yield novel insight into directed functional connectivity. Here, we leveraged this approach to test for associations between edge-wise estimates of direction flow across the brain connectome and age, sex, intellectual abilities and mental health.\n\nMethodsWe applied DGM to investigate patterns of information flow in data from 984 individuals from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and 10,249 individuals from the UK Biobank.\n\nResultsOur analysis yielded patterns of directed connectivity in independent HCP and UK Biobank data similar to those previously reported, including that the cerebellum consistently receives information from other networks. We show robust associations between information flow and age and sex for several connections, with strongest effects of age observed in the sensorimotor network. Visual, auditory and sensorimotor nodes were also linked to mental health.\n\nDiscussionOur findings support the use of DGM as a measure of directed connectivity in rsfMRI data and provide new insight into the shaping of the connectome during aging.",

    "abstract": "Sex is a key modifier of the prevalence and progression of Alzheimers disease (AD). {beta}- Amyloid (A{beta}) deposition is a pathological hallmark of AD and aberrant activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) by A{beta} has been linked to AD progression. We find that mGluR5 exhibits distinct sex-dependent pharmacological profiles. Specifically, endogenous mGluR5 from male mouse cortex and hippocampus binds with high-affinity to A{beta} oligomers whereas, female mGluR5 exhibits no affinity to A{beta} oligomers. The binding affinity of mGluR5 to A{beta} oligomer is dependent on its interaction with cellular prion protein (PrPC) as mGluR5 co-immunoprecipitates with PrPC from male, but not female, mouse brain. A{beta} oligomers also bind with high-affinity to human mGluR5 in male, but not female, cortex. The mGluR5/A{beta} oligomer/PrPC ternary complex is essential to elicit mGluR5-dependent pathological signaling and as a consequence mGluR5-regulated GSK3{beta}/ZBTB16 autophagic signaling is dysregulated in male, but not female, primary neuronal cultures. These sex-specific differences in mGluR5 signaling translate into in vivo differences in mGluR5-dependent pathological signaling between male and female AD mice. We show that the chronic inhibition of mGluR5 using a mGluR5-selective negative allosteric modulator reactivates GSK3{beta}/ZBTB16-regulated autophagy, mitigates A{beta} pathology and reverses cognitive decline in male, but not female, APPswe/PS1{Delta}E9 mice. Thus, it is evident that, unlike male brain, mGluR5 does not contribute to A{beta} pathology in female AD mice. This study highlights the complexity of mGluR5 pharmacology and A{beta} oligomer-activated pathological signaling and emphasizes the need for clinical trials redesign and analysis of sex-tailored treatment for AD.",

This link is given by Fishers theorem under the assumption that fitness can only change through mutations. Here I show that fitness, as formalised by Fisher, changes through time without invoking new mutations--allowing the co-maintenance of fast- and slow-growing genotypes. The theorem does not account for changes in population growth that naturally occur due to resource depletion, but it is key to this unforeseen co-maintenance of growth strategies. To demonstrate that fitness is not constant, as Fishers theorem predicates, I co-maintained a construct of Escherichia coli harbouring pGW155B, a non-transmissible plasmid that protects against tetracycline, in competition assays without using antibiotics. Despite growing 40% slower than its drug-sensitive counterpart, the construct with pGW155B persisted throughout the competition without tetracycline--maintaining the plasmid.

    "abstract": "Natural selection is a significant driver of speciation. Yet it remains largely unknown whether local adaptation can drive speciation through the evolution of hybrid sterility between populations. Here, we show that adaptive divergence in shoot gravitropism, the ability of a plants shoot to bend upwards in response to the downward pull of gravity, contributes to the evolution of hybrid sterility in an Australian wildflower, Senecio lautus. We find that shoot gravitropism has evolved multiple times in association with plant height between adjacent populations inhabiting contrasting environments, suggesting that these traits have evolved by natural selection. We directly tested this prediction using a hybrid population subjected to eight rounds of recombination and three rounds of selection in the field. It revealed that shoot gravitropism responds to natural selection in the expected direction of the locally adapted population. This provided an ideal platform to test whether genetic differences in gravitropism contribute to hybrid sterility in S. lautus. Using this advanced hybrid population, we discovered that crossing individuals with extreme differences in gravitropism reduce their ability to produce seed by 21%, providing strong evidence that this adaptive trait is genetically correlated with hybrid sterility. Our results suggest that natural selection can drive the evolution of locally adaptive traits that also create hybrid sterility, thus indicating an evolutionary connection between local adaptation and the origin of new species.\n\nSignificance statementNew species originate as populations become reproductively isolated from one another. Despite recent progress in uncovering the genetic basis of reproductive isolation, it remains unclear whether intrinsic reproductive barriers, such as hybrid sterility, evolve as a by-product of local adaptation to contrasting environments or evolve through non-ecological processes, such as meiotic drive. Here, we show that differences in a plants response to the pull of gravity have repeatedly evolved amongst coastal populations of an Australian wildflower, thus implicating a role of natural selection in their evolution. We found a strong genetic correlation between variation in this adaptive trait and hybrid sterility, suggesting that intrinsic reproductive barriers contribute to the origin of new species as populations adapt to heterogeneous environments.",

    "abstract": "Multiple distinct types of intracellular bacterial pathogens have been shown to alter the mechanics of their mammalian host cells to promote cell-to-cell spread. Conversely, host cells may respond by altering their own mechanical behavior to limit infection. We monitored epithelial cell monolayers sparsely infected with the intracellular bacterial pathogens Listeria monocytogenes or Rickettsia parkeri over the course of several days. Under conditions where these pathogens were able to trigger innate immune signaling through the NF-{kappa}B pathway and to use actin-based motility to spread non-lytically from cell to cell, domains of infected cells formed enormous three-dimensional mounds, where uninfected cells surrounding the infected cells became stiffer and actively moved toward the site of infection, collectively squeezing the softer and weaker infected cells up and ejecting them from the epithelial monolayer. Bacteria in mounds were less able to spread laterally in the monolayer, limiting the growth of the focus, while mounded cells eventually underwent cell death. Cells in infected monolayers exhibited behavioral and molecular signatures of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), such that coordinated forceful action by uninfected bystander cells actively eliminated large domains of infected cells, consistent with the hypothesis that this collective cell response represents an innate immune response.",

    "abstract": "MotivationsRNA tertiary structure is crucial to its many non-coding molecular functions. RNA architecture is shaped by its secondary structure composed of stems, stacked canonical base pairs, enclosing loops. While stems are captured by free-energy models, loops composed of non-canonical base pairs are not. Nor are distant interactions linking together those secondary structure elements (SSEs). Databases of conserved 3D geometries (a.k.a. modules) not captured by energetic models are lever-aged for structure prediction and design, but the computational complexity has limited their study to local elements, loops, and recently to those covering pairs of SSEs. Systematically capturing recurrent patterns on a large scale is a main challenge in the study of RNA structures.\n\nResultsIn this paper, we present an efficient algorithm to compute maximal isomorphisms in edge colored graphs. This framework is well suited to RNA structures and allows us to generalize previous approaches. In particular, we apply our techniques to find for the first time modules spanning more than 2 SSEs, while improving speed a hundredfold. We extract all recurrent base pair networks among all non-redundant RNA tertiary structures and identify a module connecting 36 different SSEs common to the 23S ribosome of E. Coli and Thermus thermophilus. We organize this information as a hierarchy of modules sharing similarities in their structure, which can serve as a basis for future research on the emergence of structural patterns.\n\nAvailabilityhttp://csb.cs.mcgill.ca/carnaval2",

Herein, we characterized the site-specific N-glycosylation of S protein at the level of intact glycopeptides. All 22 potential N-glycosites were identified in the S-protein protomer and were found to be preserved among the 753 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. The glycosites exhibited glycoform heterogeneity as expected for a human cell-expressed protein subunits. We identified masses that correspond to 157 N-glycans, primarily of the complex type. In contrast, the insect cell-expressed S protein contained 38 N-glycans, primarily of the high-mannose type. Our results revealed that the glycan types were highly determined by the differential processing of N-glycans among human and insect cells. This N-glycosylation landscape and the differential N-glycan patterns among distinct host cells are expected to shed light on the infection mechanism and present a positive view for the development of vaccines and targeted drugs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.AbbreviationsACE2angiotensin-converting enzyme IICryo-EMcryoelectron microscopyEenvelope proteinHCoV-NL63human coronavirus NL63Mmembrane proteinMSmass spectrometryMERS-CoVMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirusNnucleocapsid proteinRBDreceptor-binding domainSspike proteinSARS-CoV-2severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirusSCEstepped collision energyZic-HILICzwitterionic hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatographyView Full Text",

The Na+/K+ ATPase is responsible for a large portion of cellular energy demands but how these demands influence metabolism and create metabolic liabilities are not known. Using metabolomic approaches, we first show that digoxin, a cardiac glycoside widely used in humans, acts through disruption to central carbon metabolism via on target inhibition of the Na+/K+ ATPase that was fully recovered by expression of an allele resistant to digoxin. We further show in vivo that administration of digoxin inhibits glycolysis in both malignant and healthy cells, particularly within clinically relevant cardiac tissue, while exhibiting tumor-specific cytotoxic activity in an allografted soft tissue sarcoma. Single-cell expression analysis of over 31,000 cells within the sarcoma shows that acute Na+/K+ ATPase inhibition shifts the immune composition of the tumor microenvironment, leading to selective alterations to metabolic programs in specific immune cells thus acting both through tumor cell and microenvironmental (e.g. macrophage) cells. These results provide evidence that altering energy demands can be used to regulate glycolysis with cell-type specific consequences in a multicellular environment of biomedical interest.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which in humans is highly infectious and leads to the potentially fatal disease COVID-19, has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths and huge global disruption. The viral infection may also represent an existential threat to our closest living relatives, the nonhuman primates, many of which are endangered and often reduced to small populations. The virus engages the host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), through the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike protein. The contact surface of ACE2 displays amino acid residues that are critical for virus recognition, and variations at these critical residues are likely to modulate infection susceptibility across species. While infection studies are emerging and have shown that some primates, such as rhesus macaques and vervet monkeys, develop COVID-19-like symptoms when exposed to the virus, the susceptibility of many other nonhuman primates is unknown. Here, we show that all apes, including chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans, and all African and Asian monkeys (catarrhines), exhibit the same set of twelve key amino acid residues as human ACE2. Monkeys in the Americas, and some tarsiers, lemurs and lorisoids, differ at significant contact residues, and protein modeling predicts that these differences should greatly reduce the binding affinity of the ACE2 for the virus, hence moderating their susceptibility for infection. Other lemurs are predicted to be closer to catarrhines in their susceptibility. Our study suggests that apes and African and Asian monkeys, as well as some lemurs are all likely to be highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, representing a critical threat to their survival. Urgent actions have been undertaken to limit the exposure of Great Apes to humans, and similar efforts may be necessary for many other primate species.",

    "abstract": "How cell shape and mechanics are organized in three dimensions during tissue morphogenesis is poorly understood. In the Drosophila wing imaginal disc, we examined the mechanical processes that determine the shape of epithelial cells. Since it has been known that basement membrane influences the mechanics intracellularly, we reexamined the material properties of the basement membrane with fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy in its native environment. Further, we investigated the effect on cell shape and tissue mechanics when disruptions were instigated at three different time scales: (1) short (seconds with laser cutting), (2) medium (minutes with drug treatments), and (3) long (days with RNAi interference). We found regions in which the basement membrane is much thicker and heterogeneous than previously reported. Disrupting the actin cytoskeleton through drug treatment affects cell shape only at the apical surface, while the shapes in the medial and basal surfaces were not altered. In contrast, when integrin function was inhibited via RNAi or basement membrane integrity was disrupted by drug treatment, the medial and basal cell shapes were affected. We propose that basement membrane thickness patterns determine the height and basal surface area of cells and the curvature of folds in the wing disc. Based on these findings and previous studies, we propose a model of how cell shapes and tissue properties were determined by highly local, modular apical and basal mechanics.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=187 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/036152v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (38K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@177c8f0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1292624org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@871577org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@925bcd_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

While the well-known poly-ADP-ribosylating (PARylating) PARPs primarily function in the DNA damage response, many non-canonical mono-ADP-ribosylating (MARylating) PARPs are associated with cellular antiviral responses. We recently demonstrated robust upregulation of several PARPs following infection with Murine Hepatitis Virus (MHV), a model coronavirus. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection strikingly upregulates MARylating PARPs and induces the expression of genes encoding enzymes for salvage NAD synthesis from nicotinamide (NAM) and nicotinamide riboside (NR), while downregulating other NAD biosynthetic pathways. We show that overexpression of PARP10 is sufficient to depress cellular NAD and that the activities of the transcriptionally induced enzymes PARP7, PARP10, PARP12 and PARP14 are limited by cellular NAD and can be enhanced by pharmacological activation of NAD synthesis. We further demonstrate that infection with MHV induces a severe attack on host cell NAD+ and NADP+. Finally, we show that NAMPT activation, NAM and NR dramatically decrease the replication of an MHV virus that is sensitive to PARP activity. These data suggest that the antiviral activities of noncanonical PARP isozyme activities are limited by the availability of NAD, and that nutritional and pharmacological interventions to enhance NAD levels may boost innate immunity to coronaviruses.",

    "abstract": "The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp41 mediates the fusion between viral and host cell membranes leading to virus entry and target cell infection. Despite years of research, important aspects of this process such as the number of gp41 trimers involved and how they orchestrate the rearrangement of the lipids in the apposed membranes along the fusion pathway remain obscure. To elucidate these molecular underpinnings, we performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of HIV-1 virions pinned to the CD4 T cell membrane by different numbers of gp41 trimers. We built realistic cell and viral membranes by mimicking their respective lipid compositions. We found that a single gp41 was inadequate for mediating fusion. Lipid mixing between membranes, indicating the onset of fusion, was efficient when 3 or more gp41 trimers pinned the membranes. The gp41 trimers interacted strongly with many different lipids in the host cell membrane, triggering lipid configurational rearrangements, exchange, and mixing. Simpler membranes, comprising fewer lipid types, displayed strong resistance to fusion, revealing the crucial role of the lipidomes in HIV-1 entry. Performing simulations at different temperatures, we estimated the free energy barrier to lipid mixing, and hence membrane stalk formation, with 4 tethering gp41 trimers to be ~6.2 kcal/mol, a >4-fold reduction over estimates without gp41. Together, these findings present molecular-level, quantitative insights into the early stages of gp41-mediated HIV-1 entry. Preventing the requisite gp41 molecules from tethering the membranes or altering membrane lipid compositions may be potential intervention strategies.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEInteractions between viral envelope proteins and host cell surface receptors leading to HIV-1 entry are well studied, however the role of membrane lipids remains obscure, although entry hinges on lipid mixing and the fusion of viral and cell membranes. We performed detailed simulations of HIV-1 and target cell membranes tethered by viral gp41 trimeric proteins to elucidate the proteo-lipidic contributions to viral entry. We found that the cooperative effects of multiple gp41 trimers and natural lipidomes of the membranes facilitate membrane fusion. The functional domains of gp41 altered local lipid concentrations, reduced membrane repulsions, and facilitated inter-membrane lipid mixing. These molecular-level insights offer a glimpse of the cryptic mechanisms underlying HIV-1 entry and suggest new interventions to combat HIV-1 infection.",

    "abstract": "Raman mapping was used to determine the lipid distribution inside human mesenchymal stem cells during induced adipogenesis by monitoring C-H stretching bands of the fats inside the lipid droplets. By incorporating deuterated glucose into the cell culture medium during induction it was possible to distinguish whether or not downstream metabolites, either in lipid droplets or in the cytoplasm, had been formed before or after the adipogenic cascade, because C-D stretching bands are 1/{surd}2 shifted compared to the C-H bands. Thus, metabolites formed after the initiation of the process displayed both C-H and C-D stretching bands and so were forming during induced adipogenesis rather than prior to it. With the ability to distinguish small putative lipid drops formed by the induction of adipogenesis from those pre-formed in the cell, it was possible to analyze spectral changes occurring in the droplets at the earliest stages of adipogenesis. There were two key findings. Firstly, Raman spectra of lipid droplets evolved over time, suggesting that their composition at the early stages was not the same as at the later stages. Secondly, it was apparent that the proportion of unsaturated fats in droplets was higher at early stages than it was at later stages, suggesting that unsaturated fats arrive in the droplets faster than saturated ones.",

    "abstract": "At the basis of cell shape and behavior, actomyosin organization and force-generating property are widely studied, however very little is known about the regulation of the contractile network in space and time. Here we study the role of the epithelial-specific protein EpCAM, a contractility modulator, in cell shape and motility, and we show that it is required for the maturation of stress fibers and frontrear polarity acquisition at the single cell level. There, EpCAM ensures the remodeling of a transient active RhoA zone in the cortex of spreading epithelial cells. GTP-RhoA follows the endosomal pathway mediated by Rab35 and EHD1, where it co-evolves together with EpCAM. In fact, EpCAM balances GTP-RhoA turnover in order to tune actomyosin remodeling for cell shape, polarity and mechanical property acquisition. Impairment of GTP-RhoA endosomal trafficking either by EpCAM silencing or Rab35 / EHD1 mutant expression prevents correct myosin-II activity, stress fiber formation, and ultimately cell polarization. Collectively, this work shows that the coupling of EpCAM/RhoA co-trafficking to actomyosin rearrangement is critical for spreading, and advances our understanding of how biochemical and mechanical properties can be coupled for cell plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most frequent form of inherited intellectual disability and the best-described monogenic cause of autism. FXS is usually caused by a CGG-repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene leading to its silencing and the loss-of-expression of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). Missense mutations were also identified in FXS patients, including the recurrent FMRP-R138Q mutation. To investigate the mechanisms underlying FXS in these patients, we generated a knock-in mouse model (Fmr1R138Q) expressing the FMRP-R138Q protein. We demonstrate that the Fmr1R138Q hippocampus has an increased spine density associated with postsynaptic ultrastructural defects and increased AMPA receptor surface expression. Combining biochemical assays, high-resolution imaging and electrophysiological recordings, we also show that the mutation impairs the hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and leads to socio-cognitive deficits in Fmr1R138Q mice. These findings reveal that the R138Q mutation impacts the synaptic functions of FMRP and highlight potential mechanisms causing FXS in FMRP-R138Q patients.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented global public health and economy crisis. The origin and emergence of its causal agent, SARS-CoV-2, in the human population remains mysterious, although bat and pangolin were proposed to be the natural reservoirs. Strikingly, comparing to the SARS-CoV-2-like CoVs identified in bats and pangolins, SARS-CoV-2 harbors a polybasic furin cleavage site in its spike (S) glycoprotein. SARS-CoV-2 uses human ACE2 as its receptor to infect cells. Receptor recognition by the S protein is the major determinant of host range, tissue tropism, and pathogenesis of coronaviruses. In an effort to search for the potential intermediate or amplifying animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2, we examined receptor activity of ACE2 from 14 mammal species and found that ACE2 from multiple species can support the infectious entry of lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the wild-type or furin cleavage site deficient S protein of SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 of human/rhesus monkey and rat/mouse exhibited the highest and lowest receptor activity, respectively. Among the remaining species, ACE2 from rabbit and pangolin strongly bound to the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and efficiently supported the pseudotyped virus infection. These findings have important implications for understanding potential natural reservoirs, zoonotic transmission, human-to-animal transmission, and use of animal models.\n\nImportanceSARS-CoV-2 uses human ACE2 as primary receptor for host cell entry. Viral entry mediated by the interaction of ACE2 with spike protein largely determines host range and is the major constraint to interspecies transmission. We examined the receptor activity of 14 ACE2 orthologues and found that wild type and mutant SARS-CoV-2 lacking the furin cleavage site in S protein could utilize ACE2 from a broad range of animal species to enter host cells. These results have important implications in the natural hosts, interspecies transmission, animal models and molecular basis of receptor binding for SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing pandemic spread of a novel human coronavirus, SARS-COV-2, associated with severe pneumonia disease (COVID-19), has resulted in the generation of thousands of virus genome sequences. The rate of genome generation is unprecedented, yet there is currently no coherent nor accepted scheme for naming the expanding phylogenetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2. We present a rational and dynamic virus nomenclature that uses a phylogenetic framework to identify those lineages that contribute most to active spread. Our system is made tractable by constraining the number and depth of hierarchical lineage labels and by flagging and declassifying virus lineages that become unobserved and hence are likely inactive. By focusing on active virus lineages and those spreading to new locations this nomenclature will assist in tracking and understanding the patterns and determinants of the global spread of SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Since its first recorded appearance in December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing the disease COVID-19 has resulted in more than 2,000,000 infections and 128,000 deaths. Currently there is no proven treatment for COVID-19 and there is an urgent need for the development of vaccines and therapeutics. Coronavirus spike glycoproteins play a critical role in coronavirus entry into the host cells, as they provide host cell recognition and membrane fusion between virus and host cell. Thus, they emerged as popular and promising drug targets. Crystal structures of spike protein in its closed and open states were resolved very recently in March 2020. These structures comprise 77% of the sequence and provide almost the complete protein structure. Based on down and up positions of receptor binding domain (RBD), spike protein can be in a receptor inaccessible closed or receptor accessible open state, respectively. Starting from closed and open state crystal structures, and also 16 intermediate conformations, an extensive set of all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in the presence of explicit water and ions were performed. Simulations show that in its down position, RBD has significantly lower mobility compared to its up position; probably caused by the 6 interdomain salt bridges of RBD in down position compared to 3 in up position. Free energy landscapes based on MD simulations revealed a semi-open state located between closed and open states. Minimum energy pathway between down and up positions comprised a gradual salt bridge switching mechanism. Furthermore, although significantly lower than open state, ACE2 binding surface of RBD contained a partial solvent accessibility in its closed state.",

There are no SARS-CoV-2-specific treatments or vaccines available due to the novelty of this virus. Hence, rapid development of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed. Here we developed a pilot-scale production of a purified inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine candidate (PiCoVacc), which induced SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice, rats and non-human primates. These antibodies potently neutralized 10 representative SARS-CoV-2 strains, indicative of a possible broader neutralizing ability against SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating worldwide. Immunization with two different doses (3g or 6 g per dose) provided partial or complete protection in macaques against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, respectively, without any antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. Systematic evaluation of PiCoVacc via monitoring clinical signs, hematological and biochemical index, and histophathological analysis in macaques suggests that it is safe. These data support the rapid clinical development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for humans.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA purified inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine candidate (PiCoVacc) confers complete protection in non-human primates against SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating worldwide by eliciting potent humoral responses devoid of immunopathology",

    "abstract": "Cold stress is a critical environmental challenge that affects an organisms fitness-related traits. In Drosophila, increased resistance to specific environmental stress may lead to increased resistance to other kinds of stress. In the present study, we aimed to understand whether increased cold stress resistance in Drosophila melanogaster can facilitate their ability to tolerate other environmental stresses. For the current study, we used successfully selected replicate populations of D. melanogaster against cold shock and their control population. These selected populations have evolved several reproductive traits, including increased egg viability, mating frequency, male mating ability, ability to sire progenies, and faster recovery for mating latency under cold shock conditions. In the present work, we investigated egg viability and mating frequency with and without heat and cold shock conditions in the selected and their control populations. We also examined resistance to cold shock, heat shock, desiccation, starvation, and survival post-challenge with Staphylococcus succinus subsp. succinus PK-1 in the selected and their control populations.\n\nAfter cold-shock treatment, we found a 1.25 times increase in egg viability and a 1.57 times increase in mating frequency in the selected populations compared to control populations. Moreover, more males (0.87 times) and females (1.66 times) of the selected populations survived under cold shock conditions relative to their controls. After being subjected to heat shock, the selected populations egg viability and mating frequency increased by 0.30 times and 0.57 times, respectively, compared to control populations. Additionally, more selected males (0.31 times) and females (0.98 times) survived under heat shock conditions compared to the control populations. Desiccation resistance slightly increased in the females of the selected populations relative to their control, but we observed no change in the case of males. Starvation resistance decreased in males and females of the selected populations compared to their controls.\n\nOur findings suggest that the increased resistance to cold shock correlates with increased tolerance to heat stress, but this evolved resistance comes at a cost, with decreased tolerance to starvation.",

    "abstract": "Pathogenic variants in epilepsy genes result in a spectrum of clinical presentation, ranging from benign phenotypes to intractable epilepsies with significant co-morbidities and increased risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). One source of this phenotypic heterogeneity is modifier genes that affect penetrance, dominance or expressivity of a primary pathogenic variant. Mouse models of epilepsy also display varying degrees of clinical severity on different genetic backgrounds. Mice with heterozygous deletion of Scn1a (Scn1a+/-) model Dravet syndrome, a severe epilepsy most often caused by SCN1A haploinsufficiency. Scn1a+/- heterozygous mice recapitulate key features of Dravet syndrome, including febrile and afebrile spontaneous seizures, SUDEP, and cognitive and behavioral deficits. The Scn1a+/- mouse model also exhibits strain-dependent phenotype severity. Scn1a+/- mice maintained on the 129S6/SvEvTac (129) strain have normal lifespan and no overt seizures. In contrast, admixture with C57BL/6J (B6) results in severe epilepsy and premature lethality in [B6x129]F1.Scn1a+/- mice. In previous work, we identified Dravet Survival Modifier loci (Dsm1-Dsm5) responsible for strain-dependent differences in survival. Gabra2, encoding the GABAA 2 subunit, was nominated as the top candidate modifier at the Dsm1 locus on chromosome 5. Direct measurement of GABAA receptors found lower abundance of 2-containing receptors in hippocampal synapses of B6 mice relative to 129. We also identified a B6-specific single nucleotide intronic deletion within Gabra2 that lowers mRNA and protein by nearly 50%. Repair of this de novo deletion reestablished normal levels of Gabra2 transcript and protein expression. In the current study, we used B6 mice with the repaired Gabra2 allele to validate it as a modifier of phenotype severity in Scn1a+/- mice. Repair of Gabra2 restored transcript and protein expression, increased abundance of 2-containing GABAA receptors in hippocampal synapses, and improved seizure and survival phenotypes of Scn1a+/- mice. These findings validate Gabra2 as a genetic modifier of Dravet syndrome.",

    "abstract": "IL-1{beta} has emerged as a key mediator of the cytokine storm linked to high morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 and blockade of the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) with Anakinra has entered clinical trials in COVID-19 subjects. Yet, knowledge of the specific immune cell subsets targeted by IL-1{beta} and IL-1{beta}-induced signaling pathways in humans is limited. Utilizing mass cytometry (CyTOF) of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we identified effector memory CD4 T cells and CD4-CD8low/-CD161+ T cells as the circulating immune subtypes with the greatest expression of p-NF-{kappa}B in response to IL-1{beta} stimulation. Notably, CCR6 distinctly identified T cells most responsive to IL-1{beta}. Other subsets including CD11c myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs), classical monocytes (CM), two subsets of natural killer cells (CD16-CD56brightCD161- and CD16-CD56dimCD161+) and a population of lineage-(Lin-) cells expressing CD161 and CD25 also showed IL-1{beta}-induced expression of p-NF-kB. The IL-1R antagonist, Anakinra significantly inhibited IL-1{beta}-induced p-NF-kB in the CCR6+ T cells and CD11c mDCs with a trending inhibition in CD14 monocytes and Lin-CD161+CD25+ cells. IL-1{beta} also induced a rapid but much less robust increase in p-p38 expression as compared to p-NF-kB in the majority of these same immune cell subsets. Prolonged IL-1{beta} stimulation greatly increased p-STAT3 and to a much lesser extent p-STAT1 and p-STAT5 in T cell subsets, monocytes, DCs and the Lin-CD161+CD25+ cells suggesting IL-1{beta}-induced production of downstream STAT-activating cytokines, consistent with its role in cytokine storm. Interindividual heterogeneity and inhibition of this activation by Anakinra raises the intriguing possibility that assays to measure IL-1{beta}-induced p-NF-kB in CCR6+ T cell subtypes could identify those at higher risk of cytokine storm and those most likely to benefit from Anakinra therapy.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFungal organisms are frequently observed in surgical pathological diagnosis. In order to more accurately identify fungi in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues, it is necessary to use genomic information. The purpose of our pilot study is to identify the factors to be considered for the identification of pathogenic fungi using mycobiome analysis in FFPE tissues.\n\nMethodsWe selected 49 cases in five hospitals. In each case, FFPE tissue was cut into 50 {micro}m and DNA was extracted. Multiplex PCR with four primers (ITS1, ITS2, ITS3 and ITS4) was performed. Multiplex sequencing was performed using MinION device according to the manufacturers protocol. Sequences of each case were searched using BLASTN with an ITS database from NCBI RefSeq Targeted Loci Project with default parameter.\n\nResultsA total of 2,526 DNA nucleotides were sequenced. We were able to identify 342 fungal nucleotides in 24 (49.0%, 24/49) cases. The median value of the detected fungal DNA per case was 3 (1Q: 1 and 3Q: 14.25). The 215 (62.87%) fungal DNA contained the entire region of ITS1 or ITS2. The remaining 127 fungal DNAs were identified as fungi using partial sequence of ITS1, ITS2, 5.8S, LSU or SSU.\n\nConclusionIn conclusion, we have identified the possibility of finding pathogenic fungi through mycobiome analysis in fungal infected FFPE tissues using nanopore sequencing method. However, we have also found several limitations to be solved for further studies. If we develop a method to characterize pathogenic fungi in FFPE tissues in a follow-up study, we think it will help patients to use appropriate antifungal agents.",

    "abstract": "The pre-mRNA processing factor 4 kinase (PRP4K, also known as PRPF4B) is an essential gene. However, reduced PRP4K expression is associated with aggressive breast and ovarian cancer phenotypes including taxane therapy resistance, increased cell migration and invasion in vitro and cancer metastasis in mice; results consistent with PRP4K being a haploinsufficient tumour suppressor. Increased cell migration and invasion is associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), but how reduced PRP4K levels affect normal epithelial cell migration or EMT has not been studied. Depletion of PRP4K by small hairpin RNA (shRNA) in non-transformed mammary epithelial cell lines (MCF10A, HMLE) reduced or had no effect on 2D migration in the scratch assay but resulted in greater invasive potential in 3D transwell assays. Depletion of PRP4K in mesenchymal triple negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) resulted in both enhanced 2D migration and 3D invasion, with 3D invasion correlated with higher fibronectin levels in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF10A cells and without changes in E-cadherin. Induction of EMT in MCF10A cells, by treatment with WNT-5a and TGF-{beta}1, or depletion of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3e (eIF3e) by shRNA, resulted in significantly reduced PRP4K expression. Mechanistically, induction of EMT by WNT-5a/TGF-{beta}1 reduced PRP4K transcript levels, whereas eIF3e depletion led to reduced PRP4K translation. Finally, reduced PRP4K levels after eIF3e depletion correlated with increased YAP activity and nuclear localization, both of which are reversed by overexpression of exogenous PRP4K. Thus, PRP4K is a haploinsufficient tumour suppressor negatively regulated by EMT, that when depleted in normal mammary cells can increase cell invasion without inducing full EMT.",

    "abstract": "Germline and somatic genomes are typically the same in a multicellular organism. However, in some organisms including the parasitic nematode Ascaris, programmed DNA elimination leads to a reduced somatic genome compared to germline cells. Previous work on the parasitic nematode Ascaris demonstrated that programmed DNA elimination encompasses high fidelity chromosomal breaks at specific genome locations and loss of specific genome sequences including a major tandem repeat of 120 bp and ~1,000 germline-expressed genes. However, the precise chromosomal locations of the 120 bp repeats, the breaks regions, and the eliminated genes remained unknown. Here, we used PacBio long-read sequencing and chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) to obtain fully assembled chromosomes of Ascaris germline and somatic genomes, enabling a complete chromosomal view of DNA elimination. Surprisingly, we found that all 24 germline chromosomes undergo comprehensive chromosome end remodeling with DNA breaks in their subtelomeric regions and loss of distal sequences including the telomeres at both chromosome ends. All new Ascaris somatic chromosome ends are recapped by de novo telomere healing. We provide an ultrastructural analysis of DNA elimination and show that Ascaris eliminated DNA is incorporated into many double membrane-bound structures, similar to micronuclei, during telophase of a DNA elimination mitosis. These micronuclei undergo dynamic changes including loss of active histone marks and localize to the cytoplasm following daughter nuclei formation and cytokinesis where they form autophagosomes. Comparative analysis of nematode chromosomes suggests that germline chromosome fusions occurred forming Ascaris sex chromosomes that become independent chromosomes following DNA elimination breaks in somatic cells. These studies provide the first chromosomal view and define novel features and functions of metazoan programmed DNA elimination.",

    "abstract": "We compared two molecular point-of-care tests, the cobas Influenza A/B & RSV (cobas Liat) and the Simplexa Flu A/B & RSV (Simplexa). A total of 236 respiratory specimens from patients referred for respiratory viruses testing were retrospectively evaluated; 53 specimens tested positive for each of Flu A, Flu B, and RSV, and 77 specimens tested negative based on the results of the reference method, i.e. the Seegene Allplex Respiratory Panel 1/2/3 (Seegene, Seoul, Korea). The turnaround time (TAT) was 20 min per specimen for cobas Liat and 78 min per eight specimens for Simplexa. The numbers of invalid results were one (0.4%) in cobas Liat and 10 (4.2%) in Simplexa (p < 0.05). All results were consistent with those of the reference method in cobas Liat. The sensitivity and specificity for Flu A, Flu B and RSV A were 100% with Simplexa. However, the sensitivity for RSV B was 80.0% with Simplexa, which was significantly lower than that of cobas Liat (p < 0.05). Comparison of the cycle threshold (Ct) values for RSV with Simplexa and the reference method showed the correlation as continuous variables (p < 0.001) with a higher propensity for obtaining Ct values with Simplexa, the exception being the six false negative results; their Ct values were more than 30 in the reference method. Cobas Liat showed high sensitivity for the detection of RSV B with rapid TAT, and a good workflow efficiency.",

    "abstract": "DEAD-box proteins (DBPs) are RNA remodeling factors associated with RNA helicase activity that are found in nearly all organisms. Despite extensive studies on the mechanisms used by DBPs to regulate RNA function, very little is known about how DBPs themselves are regulated. In this work, we have analyzed the expression and regulation of DeaD/CsdA, the largest of the DBPs in Escherichia coli (E. coli). We show that deaD transcription initiates 838 nts upstream of the start of the coding region. We have also found that DeaD is autoregulated through a negative feedback mechanism that operates both at the level of mRNA stability and Rho-dependent transcription termination, and this regulation is dependent upon the 5 untranslated region (5 UTR). These findings suggest that DeaD might be regulating the conformation of its own mRNA through its RNA helicase activity to facilitate ribonuclease and Rho access to its 5UTR.",
