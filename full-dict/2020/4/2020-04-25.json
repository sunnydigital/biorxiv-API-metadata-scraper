    "abstract": "Developmental synaptic remodeling is important for the formation of precise neural circuitry and its disruption has been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. Microglia prune synapses, but integration of this synapse pruning with overlapping and concurrent neurodevelopmental processes remains elusive. Adhesion G protein-coupled receptor ADGRG1/GPR56 controls multiple aspects of brain development in a cell type-specific manner: in neural progenitor cells, GPR56 regulates cortical lamination, whereas in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, GPR56 controls developmental myelination and myelin repair. Here, we show that microglial GPR56 maintains appropriate synaptic numbers in several brain regions in a time- and circuit-dependent fashion. Phosphatidylserine (PS) on pre-synaptic elements binds GPR56 in a domain-specific manner, and microglia-specific deletion of Gpr56 leads to increased synapses as a result of reduced microglial engulfment of PS+ pre-synaptic inputs. Remarkably, a particular alternatively spliced isoform of GPR56 is selectively required for microglia-mediated synaptic pruning. Our present data provide a ligand- and isoform-specific mechanism underlying microglial GPR56-mediated synapse pruning in the context of complex neurodevelopmental processes.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be used to probe for the location of cortical somatomotor representations in humans. These somatomotor representations are dynamic and are perturbed following motor training, systematic intervention, and in disease. Evidence suggests that these representations are maintained by the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA). In the current study, we quantified the location, outline, and variability of the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) hand muscle somatomotor representation using a novel rapid-acquisition TMS method in 14 healthy young volunteers. In addition, resting motor thresholds were measured using established protocols. TMS was also used to examine short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), which is thought to measure transiently activated cortical gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) interneurons. Using stepwise regression, our results showed that the level of intracortical inhibition was a significant predictor of the FDI somatomotor representation suggesting that greater excitability of the hand area representation is possibly governed by greater activation of transient GABA interneurons.",

This study aims to identify a set of prediction algorithms for influenza, based on electronic health record (EHR) structured data and clinical notes derived data using Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) driven natural language processing (NLP).\n\nMaterials and MethodsData were extracted from an enterprise-wide data warehouse for all patients who tested positive for influenza and were seen in ambulatory care between 2009 and 2019 (N = 7,278). A text processing pipeline was used to analyze chart notes for UMLS terms for symptoms of interest to improve data quality completeness. Three models, which step up complexity of the dataset and predictors, were tested with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-selected parameters to identify predictors for influenza. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves compared test accuracy across the three models.\n\nResultsThree models identified 7, 8, and 10 predictors, and the most complex model performed best. The addition of the UMLS-driven NLP symptoms data improved data quality (false negatives) and increased the number of significant predictors. NLP also increased the strength of the models, as did the addition of two-way predictor interactions.\n\nDiscussionThe EHR is a feasible source for offering rapidly accessible datasets for influenza related prediction research that was used to produce a prediction model for influenza. Combining data collected in routine care with data science methods improved a prediction model for influenza, and in the future, could be used to drive diagnostics at the point of care.",

    "abstract": "Immunogenetic variation in humans is important in research, clinical diagnosis and increasingly a target for therapeutic intervention. Two highly polymorphic loci play critical roles, namely the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system, which is the human version of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), and the Killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) that are relevant for responses of Natural Killer (NK) cells and some subsets of T cells. Their accurate classification has typically required the use of dedicated biological specimens and a combination of in vitro and in silico efforts. Increased availability of next generation sequencing data has led to the development of ancillary computational solutions. Here, we report an evaluation of recently published algorithms to computationally infer complex immunogenetic variation in the form of HLA alleles and KIR haplotypes from whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing data. For both HLA allele and KIR gene typing, we identified tools that yielded >97% overall accuracy for 4-digit HLA types, and >99% overall accuracy for KIR gene presence, suggesting the readiness of in silico solutions for use in clinical and high-throughput research settings.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn this paper we present the AlphaPart R package, an open-source software that implements a method for partitioning breeding values and genetic trends to identify sources of genetic gain. Breeding programmes improve populations for a set of traits, which can be measured with a genetic trend calculated from averaged year of birth estimated breeding values of selection candidates. While sources of the overall genetic gain are generally known, their realised contributions are hard to quantify in complex breeding programmes. The aim of this paper is to present the AlphaPart R package and demonstrate it with a simulated pig breeding example.\n\nResultsThe package includes the main partitioning function AlphaPart, that partitions the breeding values and genetic trends by analyst defined paths, and a set of functions for handling data and results. The package is freely available from CRAN repository at http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=AlphaPart. We demonstrate the use of the package by examining the genetic gain in a pig breeding example, in which the multiplier achieved higher breeding values than the nucleus for traits measured and selected in the multiplier. The partitioning analysis revealed that these higher values depended on the accuracy and intensity of selection in the multiplier and the extent of gene flow from the nucleus. For traits measured only in the nucleus, the multiplier achieved comparable or smaller genetic gain than the nucleus depending on the amount of gene flow.\n\nConclusionsAlphaPart implements a method for partitioning breeding values and genetic trends and provides a useful tool for quantifying the sources of genetic gain in breeding programmes. The use of AlphaPart will help breeders to better understand or improve their breeding programmes.",

    "abstract": "Temporal lobe epilepsy is the fourth most common neurological disorder with about 40% of patients not responding to pharmacological treatment. Increased cellular loss in the hippocampus is linked to disease severity and pathological phenotypes such as heightened seizure propensity. While the hippocampus is the target of therapeutic interventions such as temporal lobe resection, the impact of the disease at the cellular level remains unclear in humans. Here we show that properties of hippocampal granule cells change with disease progression as measured in living, resected hippocampal tissue excised from epilepsy patients. We show that granule cells increase excitability and shorten response latency while also enlarging in cellular volume, surface area and spine density. Single-cell RNA sequencing combined with simulations ascribe the observed electrophysiological changes to gradual modification in three key ion channel conductances: BK, Cav2.2 and Kir2.1. In a bio-realistic computational network model, we show that the changes related to disease progression bring the circuit into a more excitable state. In turn, we observe that by reversing these changes in the three key conductances produces a less excitable, \"early disease-like\" state. These results provide mechanistic understanding of epilepsy in humans and will inform future therapies such as viral gene delivery to reverse the course of the disorder.",

    "abstract": "Previous research has demonstrated that negative emotional faces dilate time perception, however, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not fully understood. Previous attempts focus on the pacemaker-accumulator model of time perception, which includes a clock, memory, and decision-making stage, wherein emotion affects one of these stages; possibly by increasing pacemaker rate via arousal, increasing accumulation rate via attention, or by biasing decision-making. To further investigate the stage(s) that emotion is affecting time perception we conducted a visual temporal bisection task with sub-second intervals while recording 64-channel electroencephalogram (EEG). To separate the influence of face and timing responses the temporal stimulus was preceded and followed by a face stimulus displaying a neutral or negative expression creating three trial-types: Neg[-&gt;]Neut, Neut[-&gt;]Neg, or Neut[-&gt;]Neut. The data revealed a leftward shift in bisection point (BP) in Neg[-&gt;]Neut and Neut[-&gt;]Neg suggesting an overestimation of time. Neurally, we found the face-responsive N170 component was larger for negative faces and the N1 and contingent negative variation (CNV) were larger when preceded by a negative face. We also found an interaction effect between condition and response for the late positive component of timing (LPCt) and a significant difference between response (short/long) in the neutral condition. We conclude that a preceding negative face affects the clock stage leading to more pulses being accumulated, either through attention or arousal, as indexed by a larger N1, CNV, and N170; whereas viewing the negative face second biased decision-making leading to \"short\" responses being less likely, as evidenced by the LPCt.",

    "abstract": "Cells sense and respond to scaffold pore geometry and mechanical stimuli. Many fabrication methods used in bone tissue engineering render structures with poorly controlled pore geometries. Given that cell-scaffold interactions are complex, drawing a conclusion on how cells sense and respond to uncontrolled scaffold features under mechanical loading is difficult. Here, monodisperse templated scaffolds (MTSC) were fabricated and used as a well-defined porous scaffolds to study the effect of dynamic culture conditions on bone-like tissue formation. Human bone marrow derived stromal cells were cultured on MTSC or conventional salt-leached scaffolds (SLSC) for up to 7 weeks, either under static or dynamic conditions (wall shear stress (WSS) using spinner flask bioreactors). The influence of controlled spherical pore geometry of MTSC subjected to static or dynamic conditions on osteoblast cells differentiation, bone-like tissue formation, structure and distribution was investigated. WSS generated within the two idealized geometrical scaffold features was assessed. Distinct response to fluid flow in osteoblast cell differentiation were shown to be dependent on scaffold pore geometry. As revealed by collagen staining and micro-computed tomography images, dynamic conditions promoted a more regular extracellular matrix (ECM) formation and mineral distribution in both scaffold types compared to static conditions. The results showed that regulation of bone-related genes and the amount and the structure of mineralized ECM were dependent on scaffold pore geometry and the mechanical cues provided by the two different culture conditions. Under dynamic conditions, SLSC favored osteoblast cell differentiation and ECM formation, while MTSC enhanced ECM mineralization. The spherical pore shape in MTSC supported a more trabecular bone-like structure under dynamic conditions compared to MTSC statically cultured or to SLSC under either static or dynamic conditions. These results suggest that cell activity and bone-like tissue formation is driven not only by the pore geometry but also by the mechanical environment. This should be taken into account in the future design of complex scaffolds, which should favor cell differentiation while guiding the formation, structure and distribution of the engineered bone tissue. This could help to mimic the anatomical complexity of the bone tissue structure and to adapt to each bone defect needs.\n\nImpact statementAging of the human population leads to an increasing need for medical implants with high success rate. We provide evidence that cell activity and the amount and structure of bone-like tissue formation is dependent on the scaffold pore geometry and on the mechanical environment. Fabrication of complex scaffolds comprising concave and planar pore geometries might represent a promising direction towards the tunability and mimicry the structural complexity of the bone tissue. Moreover, the use of fabrication methods that allow a systematic fabrication of reproducible and geometrically controlled structures would simplify scaffold design optimization.",

Paramos have been regularly burned for many years, and it is not clear how paramo vegetation will respond to significant changes in their fire regimes. This study investigates differences in plant growth form composition, light levels and soil temperatures in paramo plots representing a range of recovery times since the last fire.\n\nLocationReserva Ecologica El Angel and La Bretana Nature Reserve, Carchi, Northern Ecuador.\n\nMethodsWe assessed the frequency of ten paramo growth forms, vegetation height, soil temperature, and light intensity in fifteen fire sites with historical records of fire (<1 - 15 years since fire), and one recently unburned site (at least 40 years since fire). A chronosquence of sites was used to assess potential changes in plant community composition in post-fire succession of paramo.\n\nResultsThe recovery of paramo vegetation after fire comprised three phases: initial recruitment with high growth form diversity, followed by reduced diversity, light and soil temperatures in dense tussock vegetation, and ultimately canopy height stratification with a return of diversity. All but one plant growth forms were represented in each of the three phases, and the changes reflected differences in relative abundance.\n\nConclusionsPost-fire paramo succession is characterized by clear shifts in the relative abundance of plant growth forms, ending with (co-)dominance of upright shrubs. The long-term consequences of such shifts for biodiversity and ecosystem function, given the widespread adoption of fire suppression policies in the paramo need careful, evidence-based consideration.",

    "abstract": "Chronological data from hard structures have been instrumental in reconstructing information about the past across numerous disciplines. Isotopic and trace elemental chronologies from the depositional layers of speleothems, corals, bivalve shells, fish otoliths and other structures are routinely used to reconstruct climate, growth, temperature, geological, archeological and migratory histories. Recent in situ analytical advances have revolutionized the use of these structures. This is particularly true of fish, in which detailed origin, life-history, and migration history can be reconstructed from their otoliths. Specifically, improvements in laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) have allowed increases in temporal resolution, precision, and sample throughput. Many studies now combine multiple chemical and isotopic tracers, taking advantage of multivariate statistical methods and multiple trace-elements and isotope systems to glean further information from individual samples. This paper describes a novel laser ablation split-stream (LASS) methodology which allows simultaneous collection of the Sr isotope composition (87Sr/86Sr) and trace-elemental data from chronologically deposited carbonate samples. The study investigates the accuracy and precision of varying laser spot sizes on a marine shell standard and fish otoliths using LASS and presents a comparison to traditional \"single stream methods\" using pre-existing otolith data on the same samples. Our results indicate that LASS techniques can be used to provide accurate and precise data at the same laser spot sizes as previous otolith studies, thereby doubling analytical throughput, while also providing improved spatially and temporally-matched data reduction using newly developed features for the Iolite data reduction platform.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells display massive dysregulation of key regulatory pathways due to now well-catalogued mutations and other DNA-related aberrations. Moreover, enormous heterogeneity has been commonly observed in the identity, frequency and location of these aberrations across individuals with the same cancer type or subtype, and this variation naturally propagates to the transcriptome, resulting in myriad types of dysregulated gene expression programs. Many have argued that a more integrative and quantitative analysis of heterogeneity of DNA and RNA molecular profiles may be necessary for designing more systematic explorations of alternative therapies and improving predictive accuracy.\n\nWe introduce a representation of multi-omics profiles which is sufficiently rich to account for observed heterogeneity and support the construction of quantitative, integrated, metrics of variation. Starting from the network of interactions existing in Reactome, we build a library of \"paired DNA-RNA aberrations\" that represent prototypical and recurrent patterns of dysregulation in cancer; each two-gene \"Source-Target Pair\" (STP) consists of a \"source\" regulatory gene and a \"target\" gene whose expression is plausibly \"controlled\" by the source gene. The STP is then \"aberrant\" in a joint DNA-RNA profile if the source gene is DNA-aberrant (e.g., mutated, deleted, or duplicated), and the downstream target gene is \"RNA-aberrant\", meaning its expression level is outside the normal, baseline range. With M STPs, each sample profile has exactly one of the 2M possible configurations.\n\nWe concentrate on subsets of STPs, and the corresponding reduced configurations, by selecting tissue-dependent minimal coverings, defined as the smallest family of STPs with the property that every sample in the considered population displays at least one aberrant STP within that family. These minimal coverings can be computed with integer programming. Given such a covering, a natural measure of cross-sample diversity is the extent to which the particular aberrant STPs composing a covering vary from sample to sample; this variability is captured by the entropy of the distribution over configurations.\n\nWe apply this program to data from TCGA for six distinct tumor types (breast, prostate, lung, colon, liver, and kidney cancer). This enables an efficient simplification of the complex landscape observed in cancer populations, resulting in the identification of novel signatures of molecular alterations which are not detected with frequency-based criteria. Estimates of cancer heterogeneity across tumor phenotypes reveals a stable pattern: entropy increases with disease severity. This framework is then well-suited to accommodate the expanding complexity of cancer genomes and epigenomes emerging from large consortia projects.\n\nAuthor SummaryA large variety of genomic and transcriptomic aberrations are observed in cancer cells, and their identity, location, and frequency can be highly indicative of the particular subtype or molecular phenotype, and thereby inform treatment options. However, elucidating this association between sets of aberrations and subtypes of cancer is severely impeded by considerable diversity in the set of aberrations across samples from the same population. Most attempts at analyzing tumor heterogeneity have dealt with either the genome or transcriptome in isolation. Here we present a novel, multi-omics approach for quantifying heterogeneity by determining a small set of paired DNA-RNA aberrations that incorporates potential downstream effects on gene expression. We apply integer programming to identify a small set of paired aberrations such that at least one among them is present in every sample of a given cancer population. The resulting \"coverings\" are analyzed for six cancer cohorts from the Cancer Genome Atlas, and facilitate introducing an information-theoretic measure of heterogeneity. Our results identify many known facets of tumorigenesis as well as suggest potential novel genes and interactions of interest.\n\nData Availability StatementRNA-Seq data, somatic mutation data and copy number data for The Cancer Genome Atlas were obtained through the Xena Cancer Genome Browser database (https://xenabrowser.net) from individual cancer type cohorts.

    "abstract": "Time-dependent physiological data, such as electromyogram (EMG) recordings from multiple muscles, is often difficult to interpret objectively. Here, we used EMG data gathered during mouse locomotion to investigate the effects of calculation parameters and data quality on two metrics for fractal analysis: the Higuchis fractal dimension (HFD) and the Hurst exponent (H). A curve is fractal if it repeats itself at every scale or, in other words, if its shape remains unchanged when zooming in the curve at every zoom level. Many linear and nonlinear analysis methods are available, each of them aiming at the explanation of different data features. In recent years, fractal analysis has become a powerful nonlinear tool to extract information from physiological data not visible to the naked eye. It can present, however, some dangerous pitfalls that can lead to misleading interpretations. To calculate the HFD and the H, we have extracted muscle synergies from normal and mechanically perturbed treadmill locomotion from the hindlimb of adult mice. Then, we used one set per condition (normal and perturbed walking) of the obtained time-dependent coefficients to create surrogate data with different fluctuations over the original mean signal. Our analysis shows that HFD and H are exceptionally sensitive to the presence or absence of perturbations to locomotion. However, both metrics suffer from variations in their value depending on the parameters used for calculations and the presence of quasi-periodic elements in the time series. We discuss those issues giving some simple suggestions to reduce the chance of misinterpreting the outcomes.\n\nNew & NoteworthyDespite the lack of consensus on how to perform fractal analysis of physiological time series, many studies rely on this technique. Here, we shed light on the potential pitfalls of using the Higuchis fractal dimension and the Hurst exponent. We expose and suggest how to solve the drawbacks of such methods when applied to data from normal and perturbed locomotion by combining in vivo recordings and computational approaches.",

Lyl1-deficient mice are viable, but they display mild hematopoietic and vascular defects. Here, we report that young Lyl1-/- mice exhibit transient obesity associated with general expansion of adipose tissues and unrelated to food intake. The increased fat tissue development in Lyl1-/- mice resulted from an earlier adipocyte differentiation of adipose stem cells (ASCs) through non-cell autonomous mechanisms. Specifically, we found that in Lyl1-/- mice, the vascular structures of adipose tissues are unstable, more prone to angiogenesis and, consequently, cannot maintain adipose progenitors in the niche vessel wall. Together, our data show that in Lyl1-/- mice, the impaired vascular compartment of the adipose niche promotes uncontrolled ASC activation and differentiation, leading to early adipocyte expansion and premature depletion of ASCs. Our study highlights the major structural role of the adipose tissue vascular niche in coordinating stem cell self-renewal and differentiation into adipocytes.",

The integrative analysis of heterogeneous datasets generally allows us to acquire additional insights and generate novel hypotheses about a given biological system.

    "abstract": "The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a serious public health risk. Analyzing the genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from clinical samples is crucial for the understanding of viral spread and viral evolution, as well as for vaccine development. Existing sample preparation methods for viral genome sequencing are demanding on user technique and time, and thus not ideal for time-sensitive clinical samples; these methods are also not optimized for high performance on viral genomes. We have developed MetagenomIc RNA EnRichment VirAl sequencing (MINERVA), a facile, practical, and robust approach for metagenomic and deep viral sequencing from clinical samples. This approach uses direct tagmentation of RNA/DNA hybrids using Tn5 transposase to greatly simplify the sequencing library construction process, while subsequent targeted enrichment can generate viral genomes with high sensitivity, coverage, and depth. We demonstrate the utility of MINERVA on pharyngeal, sputum and stool samples collected from COVID-19 patients, successfully obtaining both whole metatranscriptomes and complete high-depth high-coverage SARS-CoV-2 genomes from these clinical samples, with high yield and robustness. MINERVA is compatible with clinical nucleic extracts containing carrier RNA. With a shortened hands-on time from sample to virus-enriched sequencing-ready library, this rapid, versatile, and clinic-friendly approach will facilitate monitoring of viral genetic variations during outbreaks, both current and future.",

    "abstract": "Tarantulas paradoxically exhibit a diverse palette of vivid colouration despite their crepuscular to nocturnal habits. The evolutionary origin and maintenance of these colours remains a mystery. In this study, we reconstructed the ancestral states of both blue and green colouration in tarantula setae, and tested how these colours correlate with the presence of stridulation, urtication, and arboreality. Green colouration has likely evolved at least eight times, and blue colouration is likely an ancestral condition that appears to be lost more frequently than gained. While our results indicate that neither colour correlates with the presence of stridulation or urtication, the evolution of green colouration appears to depend upon the presence of arboreality, suggesting that it likely originated for, and functions in, crypsis through substrate matching among leaves. We also constructed a network of opsin homologs across tarantula transcriptomes. Despite their crepuscular tendencies, tarantulas express a full suite of opsin genes - a finding that contradicts current consensus that tarantulas have poor colour vision on the basis of low opsin diversity. Overall, our results support the intriguing hypotheses that blue colouration may have ultimately evolved via sexual selection and perhaps proximately be used in mate choice or predation avoidance due to possible sex differences in mate-searching.",

The copy number of a particular molecule fluctuates in time due to the random occurrence of production and degradation reactions. Here we consider a stochastic model for a self-regulating transcription factor whose lifespan (or time till degradation) follows a general distribution modelled as per a multidimensional phase-type process. We show that at steady state the protein copy-number distribution is the same as in a one-dimensional model with exponentially distributed lifetimes. This invariance result holds only if molecules are produced one at a time: we provide explicit counterexamples in the bursty production regime. Additionally, we consider the case of a bistable genetic switch constituted by a positively autoregulating transcription factor. The switch alternately resides in states of up- and downregulation and generates bimodal protein distributions. In the context of our invariance result, we investigate how the choice of lifetime distribution affects the rates of metastable transitions between the two modes of the distribution. The phase-type model, being non-linear and multi-dimensional whilst possessing an explicit stationary distribution, provides a valuable test example for exploring dynamics in complex biological systems.",

Microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) can generate more predictable outcomes for functional genomic and somatic therapeutic applications. MENTHU is a computational tool that predicts nuclease-targetable sites likely to result in MMEJ-repaired, homogeneous genotypes (PreMAs) in zebrafish. We deployed MENTHU on 5,885 distinct Cas9-mediated DSBs in mouse embryonic stem cells, and compared the predictions to those by inDelphi, another DSB repair predictive algorithm. MENTHU correctly identified 46% of all PreMAs available, doubling the sensitivity of inDelphi. We also introduce MENTHU@4, an MENTHU update trained on this large dataset. We trained two MENTHU-based algorithms on this larger dataset and validated them against each other, MENTHU, and inDelphi. Finally, we estimated the frequency and distribution of SpCas9-targetable PreMAs in vertebrate coding regions to evaluate MMEJ-based targeting for gene discovery. 44 out of 54 genes (81%) contained at least one early out-of-frame PreMA and 48 out of 54 (89%) did so when also considering Cas12a. We suggest that MMEJ can be deployed at scale for reverse genetics screenings and with sufficient intra-gene density rates to be viable for nearly all loss-of-function based gene editing therapeutic applications.",

    "abstract": "Cell membranes laterally segregate into microdomains enriched in certain lipids and scaffold proteins. Membrane microdomains modulate protein-protein interactions and are essential for cell polarity, signaling and membrane trafficking. How cells organize their membrane microdomains, and the physiological importance of these microdomains, is unknown. In eukaryotes, the cortical actin cytoskeleton is proposed to act like a fence, constraining the dynamics of membrane microdomains. Like their eukaryotic counterparts, bacterial cells have functional membrane microdomains (FMMs) that act as platforms for the efficient oligomerization of protein complexes. In this work, we used the model organism Bacillus subtilis to demonstrate that FMM organization and movement depend primarily on the interaction of FMM scaffold proteins with the domains protein cargo, rather than with domain lipids. Additionally, the MreB actin-like cytoskeletal network that underlies the bacterial membrane was found to frame areas of the membrane in which FMM mobility is concentrated. Variations in membrane fluidity did not affect FMM mobility whereas alterations in cell wall organization affected FMM mobility substantially. Interference with MreB organization alleviates FMM spatial confinement whereas, by contrast, inhibition of cell wall synthesis strengthens FMM confinement. The restriction of FMM lateral mobility by the submembranous actin-like cytoskeleton or the extracellular wall cytoskeleton appears to be a conserved mechanism in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells for localizing functional protein complexes in specific membrane regions, thus contributing to the organization of cellular processes.",

However, little is known about which countries are participating or how they collaborate with each other. Here, we present an analysis of all 67,885 preprints posted on bioRxiv (through 2019) using the first comprehensive dataset of country-level preprint author affiliations. We find the plurality of preprints (39%) come from the United States, and that countries such as the U.S. and U.K. are overrepresented on bioRxiv relative to their overall scientific output, while countries including China, Russia, and Turkey show lower bioRxiv adoption. We describe a set of \"contributor countries\" including Uganda, Croatia and Thailand that appear almost exclusively as non-senior authors on international collaborations. Lastly, we find multiple journals that publish a disproportionate number of preprints from some countries, a dynamic that almost always benefits manuscripts from the U.S.",

Here, we demonstrate proof of concept for an adjunctive therapy that allows intravenous antibiotic treatment without driving the evolution and onward transmission of resistance. We repurposed the FDA-approved bile sequestrant cholestyramine, which we show binds the antibiotic daptomycin, as an  anti-antibiotic to disable systemically-administered daptomycin reaching the gut. We hypothesized that adjunctive cholestyramine could enable therapeutic daptomycin treatment in the bloodstream, while preventing transmissible resistance emergence in opportunistic pathogens colonizing the gastrointestinal tract. We tested this idea in a mouse model of Enterococcus faecium gastrointestinal tract colonization. In mice treated with daptomycin, adjunctive cholestyramine therapy reduced the fecal shedding of daptomycin-resistant E. faecium by up to 80-fold. These results provide proof of concept for an approach that could reduce the spread of antibiotic resistance for important hospital pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) catalyze the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to lysine residues of histones and play a central role in transcriptional regulation in diverse biological processes. Dysregulation of HAT activity can lead to human diseases including developmental disorders and cancer. Through genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens, we identified several HATs of the MYST family as fitness genes for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Here we investigate the essentiality of lysine acetyltransferase KAT7 in AMLs driven by the MLL-X gene fusions. We found that KAT7 loss leads to a rapid and complete loss of both H3K14ac and H4K12ac marks, in association with reduced proliferation, increased apoptosis and differentiation of AML cells. Acetyltransferase activity of KAT7 is essential for the proliferation of these cells. Mechanistically, our data propose that acetylated histones provide a platform for the recruitment of MLL-fusion-associated adaptor proteins such as BRD4 and AF4 to gene promoters. Upon KAT7 loss, these factors together with RNA polymerase II rapidly dissociate from several MLL-fusion target genes that are essential for AML cell proliferation, including MEIS1, PBX3 and SENP6. Our findings reveal that KAT7 is a plausible therapeutic target for this poor prognosis AML subtype.",

Together, these neurons form functional networks that direct animal behaviour. Current approaches that allow the interrogation of specific populations of neurons and neural circuits rely heavily on targeting their gene expression profiles or connectivity. However, these approaches are often unable to delineate specific neuronal populations. Here, we developed a novel intersectional split intein-mediated split-Cre recombinase system that can selectively label specific types of neurons based on their gene expression profiles and structural connectivity. We developed this system by splitting Cre recombinase into two fragments with evolved split inteins and subsequently expressed one fragment under the influence of a cell type-specific promoter in a transgenic animal, and delivered the other fragment via retrograde viral gene transfer. This approach results in the reconstitution of Cre recombinase in only specific population of neurons projecting from a specific brain region or in those of a specific neuronal type. Taken together, our split intein-based split-Cre system will be useful for sophisticated characterization of mammalian brain circuits.",

The limit of detection of the platform is under 10 genomic copies in under 30 minutes, and the quantitative dynamic range is at least 4 logs.

    "abstract": "Early detection of infection with SARS-CoV-2 is key to managing the current global pandemic, as evidence shows the virus is most contagious on or before symptom onset. Here, we introduce a low-cost, high-throughput method for diagnosing and studying SARS-CoV-2 infection. Dubbed Pathogen-Oriented Low-Cost Assembly & Re-Sequencing (POLAR), this method amplifies the entirety of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. This contrasts with typical RT-PCR-based diagnostic tests, which amplify only a few loci. To achieve this goal, we combine a SARS-CoV-2 enrichment method developed by the ARTIC Network (https://artic.network/) with short-read DNA sequencing and de novo genome assembly. Using this method, we can reliably (>95% accuracy) detect SARS-CoV-2 at a concentration of 84 genome equivalents per milliliter (GE/mL). Almost all diagnostic methods currently authorized for use by the United States Food and Drug Administration with the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Emergency Use Authorization require larger concentrations of the virus to achieve this degree of accuracy. In addition, we can reliably assemble the SARS-CoV-2 genome in the sample, often with no gaps and perfect accuracy. The genotypic data contained in these genome assemblies enable the more effective analysis of disease spread than is possible with an ordinary binary diagnostic. These data can also help identify vaccine and drug targets. Finally, we show that the diagnoses obtained using POLAR of both positive and negative clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples 100% match the diagnoses obtained in a clinical diagnostic lab using the Center for Disease Controls 2019-Novel Coronavirus test. Using POLAR, a single person can manually process 192 samples over an 8- hour experiment at the cost of [~]$36 per patient (as of December 7th, 2022), enabling a 24-hour turnaround with sequencing and data analysis time. We anticipate that further testing and refinement will allow greater sensitivity in this approach.",

To understand how Shigella rewires macrophages prior to epithelium invasion, we performed genome-wide and focused secondary CRISPR knockout and CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screens in Shigella flexneri-infected human monocytic THP-1 cells. Knockdown of the Toll-like receptor 1/2 signaling pathway significantly reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production, enhanced host cell survival, and controlled intracellular pathogen growth. Knockdown of the enzymatic component of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex enhanced THP-1 cell survival. Small molecule inhibitors blocking key components of these pathways had similar effects; these were validated with human monocyte-derived macrophages, which closely mimic the in vivo physiological state of cells post-infection. High-throughput CRISPR screens can elucidate how S. flexneri triggers inflammation and redirects host pyruvate catabolism for energy acquisition before killing macrophages, pointing to new shigellosis therapies.",

    "abstract": "Many drugs have the potential to induce the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes, particularly cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), in hepatocytes. Hepatocytes can accurately evaluate drug-mediated CYP3A4 induction as the gold standard for in vitro hepatic toxicology test, but their lot variation is an issue to be solved. Only a limited number of immortalized hepatocyte cells have been reported. In this study, we generated an immortalized cell expressing CYP3A4 from a patient with drug-induced liver injury (DILI). To generate DILI-derived cells with a high expression of CYP3A4, we employed a three-step approach: 1. Differentiation of DILI-induced pluripotent stem cells (DILI-iPSCs); 2. Immortalization of the differentiated cells; 3. Selection of the cells with puromycin. We hypothesize that cells with a high expression of cytochrome P450 genes can survive even after exposure to cytotoxic antibiotics because of high drug-metabolism activity. Puromycin, one of the cytotoxic antibiotics, was used in this study because of its rapid cytocidal effect at a low concentration. Phenotypic studies in vitro revealed that the puromycin-selected cells (HepaSM or SI cells) constitutively expressed the CYP3A4 gene at an extremely high level, and continued to proliferate at least up to 34 population doublings for more than 250 days. The expression profiles were independent of population doublings. Drug-mediated induction test revealed that the cells significantly increased CYP3A4 after exposure to rifampicin, suggesting that the immortalized cells would serve as another useful source for in vitro examination of drug metabolism and CYP3A4 induction.",

    "abstract": "In vertebrates, bone formation is dynamically controlled by the activity of two specialized cell types: the bone-generating osteoblasts and bone-degrading osteoclasts. Osteoblasts produce the soluble receptor activator of NF\u03baB ligand (RANKL) that binds to its receptor RANK on the surface of osteoclast precursor cells to promote osteoclastogenesis, a process that involves cell-cell fusion and assembly of molecular machinery to ultimately degrade the bone. CD13 is a transmembrane aminopeptidase that is highly expressed in cells of myeloid lineage has been shown to regulate dynamin-dependent receptor endocytosis and recycling and is a necessary component of actin cytoskeletal organization. In the present study, we show that CD13-deficient mice display a normal distribution of osteoclast progenitor populations in the bone marrow, but present a low bone density phenotype. Further, the endosteal bone formation rate is similar between genotypes, indicating a defect in osteoclast-specific function in vivo. Loss of CD13 led to exaggerated in vitro osteoclastogenesis as indicated by significantly enhanced fusion of bone marrow-derived multinucleated osteoclasts in the presence of M-CSF and RANKL, resulting in abnormally large cells with remarkably high numbers of nuclei with a concomitant increase in bone resorption activity. Similarly, we also observed increased formation of multinucleated giant cells (MGC) in CD13KO bone marrow progenitor cells stimulated with IL-4 and IL-13, suggesting that CD13 may regulate cell-cell fusion events via a common pathway, independent of RANKL signaling. Mechanistically, while expression levels of the fusion-regulatory proteins dynamin and DC-STAMP are normally downregulated as fusion progresses in fusion-competent mononucleated progenitor cells, in the absence of CD13 they are uniformly sustained at high levels, even in mature multi-nucleated osteoclasts. Taken together, we conclude that CD13 may regulate cell-cell fusion by controlling expression and localization of key fusion proteins that are critical for both osteoclast and MGC fusion.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection presents an immense global health problem. Spike (S) protein of coronavirus is the primary determinant of its entry into the host as it consists of both receptor binding and fusion domain. While tissue tropism, host range, and pathogenesis of coronavirus are primarily controlled by the interaction of S protein with the cell receptor, it is possible that proteolytic activation of S protein by host cell proteases also plays a decisive role. The host-cell proteases have shown to be involved in the proteolysis of S protein and cleaving it into two functional subunits, S1 and S2, during the maturation process. In the present study, the interaction of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 with different host proteases like furin, cathepsin B, and plasmin has been analyzed. Incorporation of the furin cleavage site (R-R-A-R) in the S protein in SARS-CoV-2 has been studied by mutating the individual amino acid. Our results suggest the polytropic nature of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. Our analysis indicated that a single amino acid substitution in the polybasic cleavage site of S protein perturb the binding of cellular proteases. This mutation study might help to generate an attenuated SARS-CoV-2. Besides, targeting of host proteases by inhibitors may result in a practical approach to stop the cellular spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to develop its antiviral.",

    "abstract": "Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) is an essential chromatin-based repressor of gene transcription. However, how PRC1 engages with chromatin to identify its target genes and achieve gene repression remains poorly defined, representing a major hurdle to our understanding of Polycomb system function. Here we use genome engineering and single particle tracking to dissect how PRC1 binds to chromatin in live mouse embryonic stem cells. We reveal that PRC1 is highly dynamic, with only a small fraction stably interacting with chromatin. By integrating subunit-specific dynamics, chromatin binding, and abundance measurements, we discover that PRC1 exhibits surprisingly low occupancy at target sites. Furthermore, we employ perturbation approaches to uncover how specific components of PRC1 define its kinetics and chromatin binding. Together, these discoveries provide a quantitative understanding of chromatin binding by PRC1 in live cells, and suggests that chromatin modification, as opposed to PRC1 complex occupancy, is central to gene repression.",

    "abstract": "After spinal cord injury (SCI), the majority of individuals develop spasticity, a debilitating condition involving involuntary movements, co-contraction of antagonistic muscles, and hyperreflexia. By acting on GABAergic and Ca2+-dependent signaling, current anti-spastic medications lead to serious side effects, including a drastic decrease in motoneuronal excitability which impairs motor function and rehabilitation efforts. Exercise, in contrast, decreases spastic symptoms without decreasing motoneuron excitability. These functional improvements coincide with an increase in expression of the chloride co-transporter KCC2 in lumbar motoneurons. Thus, we hypothesized that spastic symptoms can be alleviated directly through restoration of chloride homeostasis and endogenous inhibition by increasing KCC2 activity. Here, we used the recently developed KCC2 enhancer, CLP257, to evaluate the effects of acutely increasing KCC2 extrusion capability on spastic symptoms after chronic SCI. Sprague Dawley rats received a spinal cord transection at T12 and were either bike-trained or remained sedentary for 5 weeks. Increasing KCC2 activity in the lumbar enlargement improved the rate-dependent depression of the H-reflex and reduced both phasic and tonic EMG responses to muscle stretch in sedentary animals after chronic SCI. Furthermore, the improvements due to this pharmacological treatment mirror those of exercise. Together, our results suggest that pharmacologically increasing KCC2 activity is a promising approach to decrease spastic symptoms in individuals with SCI. By acting to directly to restore endogenous inhibition, this strategy has potential to avoid severe side effects and improve the quality of life of affected individuals.\n\nSignificance StatementSpasticity is a condition that develops after spinal cord injury (SCI) and causes major complications for individuals. We have previously reported that exercise attenuates spastic symptoms after SCI through an increase in expression of the chloride co-transporter KCC2, suggesting that restoring chloride homeostasis contributes to alleviating spasticity. However, the early implementation of rehabilitation programs in the clinic is often problematic due to co-morbidities. Here, we demonstrate that pharmacologically enhancing KCC2 activity after chronic SCI reduces multiple signs of spasticity, without the need for rehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveDeletion of Translin (Tsn) from mice induces an unusual metabolic profile characterized by robust adiposity, normal body weight and glucose tolerance. Translin (TN) protein and its partner, trax (TX), form the TN/TX microRNA-degrading enzyme. Since the microRNA system plays a prominent role in regulating metabolism, we reasoned that the metabolic profile displayed by Tsn KO mice might reflect dysregulation of microRNA signaling.\n\nMethodsTo test this hypothesis, we inserted a mutation, E126A, in Tsnax, the gene encoding TX, that abolishes the microRNA-degrading enzymatic activity of the TN/TX complex. In addition, to help define the cell types that drive the adiposity phenotype, we have also generated mice with floxed alleles of Tsn or Tsnax.\n\nResultsIntroduction of the E126A mutation in Tsnax does not impair expression of TN or TX proteins or their co-precipitation. Furthermore, these mice display selective increases in microRNAs that match those induced by Tsn deletion, confirming that this mutation in Tsnax inactivates the microRNA-degrading activity of the TN/TX complex. Mice homozygous for the Tsnax (E126A) mutation display a metabolic profile that closely mimics that of Tsn KO mice.\n\nSelective deletion of Tsn or Tsnax from either adipocytes or hepatocytes, two candidate cell types, does not phenocopy the elevated adiposity displayed by mice with constitutive Tsn deletion or the Tsnax(E126A) mutation. Furthermore, global, conditional deletion of Tsn in adulthood does not elicit increased adiposity.\n\nConclusionTaken together, these findings indicate that inactivation of the TN/TX microRNA-degrading enzyme during development is necessary to drive the robust adiposity displayed by Tsn KO mice.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2, a member of the coronavirus family, is responsible for the current COVID-19 worldwide pandemic. We previously demonstrated that five nucleotide analogues inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), including the active triphosphate forms of Sofosbuvir, Alovudine, Zidovudine, Tenofovir alafenamide and Emtricitabine. We report here the evaluation of a library of additional nucleoside triphosphate analogues with a variety of structural and chemical features as inhibitors of the RdRps of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. These features include modifications on the sugar (2 or 3 modifications, carbocyclic, acyclic, or dideoxynucleotides) or on the base. The goal is to identify nucleotide analogues that not only terminate RNA synthesis catalyzed by these coronavirus RdRps, but also have the potential to resist the viruses exonuclease activity. We examined these nucleotide analogues with regard to their ability to be incorporated by the RdRps in the polymerase reaction and then prevent further incorporation. While all 11 molecules tested displayed incorporation, 6 exhibited immediate termination of the polymerase reaction (Carbovir triphosphate, Ganciclovir triphosphate, Stavudine triphosphate, Entecavir triphosphate, 3-O-methyl UTP and Biotin-16-dUTP), 2 showed delayed termination (Cidofovir diphosphate and 2-O-methyl UTP), and 3 did not terminate the polymerase reaction (2-fluoro-dUTP, 2-amino-dUTP and Desthiobiotin-16-UTP). The coronavirus genomes encode an exonuclease that apparently requires a 2 -OH group to excise mismatched bases at the 3-terminus. In this study, all of the nucleoside triphosphate analogues we evaluated form Watson-Cricklike base pairs. All the nucleotide analogues which demonstrated termination either lack a 2-OH, have a blocked 2-OH, or show delayed termination. These nucleotides may thus have the potential to resist exonuclease activity, a property that we will investigate in the future. Furthermore, prodrugs of five of these nucleotide analogues (Brincidofovir/Cidofovir, Abacavir, Valganciclovir/Ganciclovir, Stavudine and Entecavir) are FDA approved for other viral infections, and their safety profile is well known. Thus, they can be evaluated rapidly as potential therapies for COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "BCG remains first-line therapy for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NIMBC) but its mechanism of action is not fully understood nor is its efficacy complete. We engineered a recombinant BCG (BCG-STING) that releases increased levels the STING agonist, c-di-AMP. Compared with BCG, BCG-STING demonstrated superior antitumor efficacy in models of NMIBC, more potent pro-inflammatory cytokine responses, greater myeloid cell reprogramming (M1 shift) associated with enhanced epigenetic and metabolomic changes and enhanced Teffector infiltration, all favoring antitumor immunity. These findings support the local induction by BCG-STING of enhanced and remodeled innate immune responses, sometimes termed trained immunity, and ultimately enhanced T cell immunity. They reveal that STING pathway activation is a proximal trigger in trained immunity remodeling, which may be a central mechanism for both BCG and BCG-STING antitumor activity in NMIBC.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEThis study demonstrates that the antitumor efficacy of BCG during bladder cancer is mediated via myeloid cell \"training\" in which BCG leads to epigenetic modifications accompanied by metabolic and cellular reprogramming changes which promote antitumor immunity. Using a recombinant BCG strain which delivers high levels of a STING agonist, we further demonstrate that STING pathway stimulation strongly enhances myeloid cell training as well as antitumor potency.",
