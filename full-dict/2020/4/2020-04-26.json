    "abstract": "The forward time simulation tool rSHAPE (R-package for Simulated Haploid Asexual Population Evolution) was designed to complement the theoretical and empirical study of evolution. Included with rSHAPE are functions to programmatically build, run, and initially process results of an evolutionary experiment defined by the range of experimental conditions. As experimental evolution often studies both the emergence and fate of de novo mutants, I validated rSHAPE by confirming its ability to replicate seminal theoretical expectations concerning changes in fitness through time and the fixation probability of mutants. As an example of how rSHAPE can support both theoretical and empirical research, I applied rSHAPE to study how the laboratory protocol of serial passaging, common in microbial experimental evolution, affects the fixation probability of de novo mutants. Unlike related theoretical work which modelled growth as effectively exponential (Wahl et al., 2002), this study considered populations experiencing logistic growth which is common to microbes undergoing serial passaging. In contrast to exponential growth, when a population undergoes logistic growth the probability of a mutant arising and eventually fixing depends upon when a mutant arises during a growth phase.

    "abstract": "Genotype imputation across populations of mixed ancestry is critical for optimal discovery in large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Methods for direct imputation of GWAS summary statistics were previously shown to be practically as accurate as summary statistics produced after raw genotype imputation, while incurring orders of magnitude lower computational burden. Given that direct imputation needs a precise estimation of linkage-disequilibrium (LD) and that most of the methods using a small reference panel e.g., ~2,500 subject coming from the 1000 Genome Project, there is a great need for much larger and more diverse reference panels. To accurately estimate the LD needed for an exhaustive analysis of any cosmopolitan cohort, we developed DISTMIX2. DISTMIX2: i) uses a much larger and more diverse reference panel and ii) estimates weights of ethnic mixture based solely on Z-scores (when AFs are not available). We applied DISTMIX2 to GWAS summary statistics from the Psychiatric Genetic Consortium (PGC). DISTMIX2 uncovered signals in numerous new regions, with most of these findings coming from the rarer variants. Rarer variants provide much sharper location for the signals compared with common variants, as the LD for rare variants extends over a lower distance than for common ones. For example, while the original PGC post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) study found only 3 marginal signals for common variants, we now uncover a very strong signal for a rare variant in PKN2, a gene associated with neuronal and hippocampal development. Thus, DISTMIX2 provides a robust and fast (re)imputation approach for most Psychiatric GWAS studies.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotes, conserved mechanisms ensure that cell growth is coordinated with nutrient availability. Overactive growth during nutrient limitation (\"nutrient-growth dysregulation\") can lead to rapid cell death. Here, we demonstrate that cells can adapt to nutrient-growth dysregulation by evolving major metabolic defects. Specifically, when yeast lysine auxotrophic mutant lys- encountered lysine limitation, an evolutionarily novel stress, cells suffered nutrient-growth dysregulation. A sub-population repeatedly evolved to lose the ability to synthesize organosulfurs (lys-orgS-). Organosulfurs, mainly glutathione and glutathione conjugates, were released by lys- cells during lysine limitation when growth was dysregulated, but not during glucose limitation when growth was regulated. Limiting organosulfurs conferred a frequency-dependent fitness advantage to lys-orgS- by eliciting a proper slow growth program including autophagy. Thus, nutrient-growth dysregulation is associated with rapid organosulfur release, which enables the selection of organosulfur auxotrophy to better tune cell growth to the metabolic environment. We speculate that evolutionarily novel stresses can trigger atypical release of certain metabolites, setting the stage for the evolution of new ecological interactions.",

    "abstract": "The killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) proteins evolve to fight viruses and mediate the bodys reaction to pregnancy. These roles provide selection pressure for variation at both the structural/haplotype and base/allele levels. At the same time, the genes have evolved relatively recently by tandem duplication and therefore exhibit very high sequence similarity over thousands of bases. These variation-homology patterns make it impossible to interpret KIR haplotypes from abundant short-read genome sequencing data at population scale using existing methods. Here, we developed an efficient computational approach for in silico KIR probe interpretation (KPI) to accurately interpret individuals KIR genes and haplotype-pairs from KIR sequencing reads. We designed synthetic 25-base sequence probes by analyzing previously reported haplotype sequences, and we developed a bioinformatics pipeline to interpret the probes in the context of 16 KIR genes and 16 haplotype structures. We demonstrated its accuracy on a synthetic data set as well as a real whole genome sequences from 748 individuals from The Genome of the Netherlands (GoNL). The GoNL predictions were compared with predictions from SNP-based predictions. Our results show 100% accuracy rate for the synthetic tests and a 99.6% family-consistency rate in the GoNL tests. Agreement with the SNP-based calls on KIR genes ranges from 72-100% with a mean of 92%; most differences occur in genes KIR2DS2, KIR2DL2, KIR2DS3, and KIR2DL5 where KPI predicts presence and the SNP-based interpretation predicts absence. Overall, the evidence suggests that KPIs accuracy is 97% or greater for both KIR gene and haplotype-pair predictions, although the presence/absence genotyping leads to ambiguous haplotype-pair predictions with 16 reference KIR haplotype structures. KPI is free, open, and easily executable as a Nextflow workflow supported by a Docker environment at https://github.com/droeatumn/kpi.",

Our ability to understand acoustic speech seems independent from that to understand visual speech, yet neuroimaging studies suggest that the neural representations largely overlap. Addressing this discrepancy, we tested where the brain represents acoustically and visually conveyed word identities in a full-brain MEG study. Our analyses dissociate cerebral representations that merely reflect the physical stimulus from those that also predict comprehension, and suggest that these overlap only in specific temporal and frontal regions. Moreover, representations predictive of auditory and visual comprehension converge only in angular and inferior frontal regions. These results provide a neural explanation for the behavioural dissociation of acoustic and visual speech comprehension and suggest that cerebral representations encoding word identities may be more modality-specific than often upheld.",

    "abstract": "The spatio-temporal program of genome replication across eukaryotes is thought to be driven both by the uneven loading of pre-replication complexes (pre-RCs) across the genome at the onset of S-phase, and by differences in the timing of activation of these complexes during S-phase. To determine the degree to which distribution of pre-RC loading alone could account for chromosomal replication patterns, we mapped the binding sites of the Mcm2-7 helicase complex (MCM) in budding yeast, fission yeast, mouse and humans. We observed identical MCM double-hexamer footprints across the species, but notable differences in their distribution: In budding yeast, complexes were present in sharp peaks comprised largely of single double-hexamers; in fission yeast, corresponding peaks typically contained 4 to 8 double-hexamers, were more disperse, and showed a striking correlation with AT content. In mouse and humans, complexes were even more disperse, with a preference for regions of high GC content. Nonetheless, most fluctuations in replication timing in all four organisms could be accounted for by differences in chromosomal MCM distribution. This analysis also identified genomic regions whose replication timing was clearly not attributable to MCM density. The most notable was the inactive X-chromosome, which replicates late in S phase despite the fact that both MCM abundance and chromosomal distribution were comparable to those on the early replicating active X-chromosome. We conclude that, although certain genomic regions, most notably the inactive X-chromosome, are subject to post-licensing regulation, most differences in replication timing along the chromosome reflect uneven chromosomal distribution of stochastically firing pre-replication complexes.",

However, the results of molecular species delimitation can vary with the data sets and methods that are used. Here we use a two-step approach to delimit species in the genus Heptathela, a group of primitively segmented trapdoor spiders that are endemic to Japanese islands. Morphological evidence suggests the existence of 19 species in the genus. We tested this initial species hypothesis by using six molecular species-delimitation methods to analyse 180 mitochondrial COI sequences of Heptathela sampled from across the known range of the genus. We then conducted a set of more focused analyses by sampling additional genetic markers from the subset of taxa that were inconsistently delimited by the single-locus analyses of mitochondrial DNA. Multilocus species delimitation was performed using two Bayesian approaches based on the multispecies coalescent. Our approach identified 20 putative species among the 180 sampled individuals of Heptathela. We suggest that our two-step approach provides an efficient strategy for delimiting species while minimizing costs and computational time.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is a hallmark of numerous airway diseases, contributing to extensive cell and tissue damage. Cell membranes and the airway mucosal lining are rich in phospholipids that are particularly susceptible to oxidative attack, producing bioactive molecules including oxidized phosphatidylcholines (OxPC). With the recent discovery of elevated OxPC in asthmatic patients after allergen challenge, we hypothesized that OxPC directly contribute to disease by inducing airway epithelial cell dysfunction.\n\nWe found that OxPC induced dose-dependent cell stress and loss of viability in BEAS-2B and Calu-3 cell lines and primary human epithelial cells. These responses corresponded with significant epithelial barrier dysfunction, which was further compounded when combining OxPC with an epithelial wound. OxPC inhibited DNA synthesis and migration required to re-establish barrier function, but cells recovered if OxPC were washed off soon after treatment. OxPC induced generation of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial dysfunction, raising the possibility that OxPC cause pathological lipid metabolism in a self-propagating cycle. The oxidative stress induced by OxPC could not be abrogated by putative OxPC receptor blockers, but partial recovery of barrier function, proliferation and lipid peroxidation could be achieved with the antioxidant n-acetyl cysteine.\n\nIn summary, we have identified OxPC as a group of bioactive molecules that significantly impair multiple facets of epithelial cell function, consistent with pathological features of asthma. Further characterisation of the mechanisms by which OxPC affect epithelial cells could yield new insights into how oxidative stress contributes to the pathogenesis of airway disease.",

The recent growth in the availability of genomes and metagenomes provides an opportunity for in silico prediction of novel AMP molecules.

    "abstract": "MotivationWord embedding approaches have revolutionized Natural Language Processing NLP research. These approaches aim to map words to a low-dimensional vector space in which words with similar linguistic features are close in the vector space. These NLP approaches also preserve local linguistic features, such as analogy. Embedding-based approaches have also been developed for proteins. To date, such approaches treat amino acids as words, and proteins are treated as sentences of amino acids. These approaches have been evaluated either qualitatively, via visual inspection of the embedding space, or extrinsically, via performance on a downstream task. However, it is difficult to directly assess the intrinsic quality of the learned embeddings.\n\nResultsIn this paper, we introduce dom2vec, an approach for learning protein domain embeddings. We also present four intrinsic evaluation strategies which directly assess the quality of protein domain embeddings. We leverage the hierarchy relationship of InterPro domains, known secondary structure classes, Enzyme Commission class information, and Gene Ontology annotations in these assessments. These evaluations allow us to assess the quality of learned embeddings independently of a particular downstream task. Importantly, allow us to draw an analog between the local linguistic features in nature languages and the domain structure and function information in domain architectures, thus providing data-driven insights into the context found in the language of domain architectures. We also show that dom2vec embeddings outperform, or are comparable with, state-of-the-art approaches on downstream tasks.\n\nAvailabilityThe protein domain embeddings vectors and the entire code to reproduce the results are available at https://github.com/damianosmel/dom2vec.\n\nContactmelidis@l3s.uni-hannover.de",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma tumors exhibit extensive inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity, which has contributed to poor outcomes of numerous clinical trials and continues to complicate the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Current in vitro models do not preserve the cellular and mutational diversity of parent tumors and often require a lengthy generation time with variable efficiency. Here, we describe detailed procedures for generating glioblastoma organoids (GBOs) from surgically resected patient tumor tissue using a chemically defined medium without cell dissociation. By preserving cell-cell interactions and minimizing clonal selection, GBOs maintain the cellular heterogeneity of parent tumors. We include methods for passaging and cryopreserving GBOs for continued use, biobanking, and long-term recovery. We further describe procedures for investigating patient-specific responses to immunotherapies by co-culturing GBOs with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. This protocol takes approximately 2-4 weeks to generate GBOs and 5-7 days to perform CAR-T cell co-culture. Competence with human cell culture, tissue processing, immunohistology, and microscopy is required for optimal results.\n\nShort SummaryDetailed procedures for generating and biobanking glioblastoma organoids from resected patient tumor tissue and testing CAR-T cell efficacy by co-culture.

    "abstract": "The factors mediating fatal SARS-CoV-2 infections are poorly understood. Here, we show that cigarette smoke causes a dose-dependent upregulation of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, in rodent and human lungs. Using single-cell sequencing data, we demonstrate that ACE2 is expressed in a subset of secretory cells in the respiratory tract. Chronic smoke exposure triggers the expansion of this cell population and a concomitant increase in ACE2 expression. In contrast, quitting smoking decreases the abundance of these secretory cells and reduces ACE2 levels. Finally, we demonstrate that ACE2 expression is responsive to inflammatory signaling and can be upregulated by viral infections or interferon treatment. Taken together, these results may partially explain why smokers are particularly susceptible to severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. Furthermore, our work identifies ACE2 as an interferon-stimulated gene in lung cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infections could create positive-feedback loops that increase ACE2 levels and facilitate viral dissemination.",

    "abstract": "Time has an integral role in episodic memory and previous work has implicated the medial temporal lobe in both representing time and discriminating between similar memory traces. Here we developed a novel paradigm to test mnemonic discrimination for temporal duration, as previous temporal work has largely focused on order or maintaining information over time. Thirty-five healthy, young adults completed a continuous-recognition temporal discrimination task in which participants were tasked with detecting a change of stimulus duration on the order of 0.5 seconds and whole-brain high-resolution fMRI data were acquired during this process. Analyses of behavioral results indicate that participants were successful at detecting whether the stimulus duration changed. Further, fMRI analyses revealed that successful trial performance was associated with differential processes in the left entorhinal and perirhinal cortices. Specifically, the left entorhinal cortex was differentially engaged during encoding trials that preceded Target detection, and the left perirhinal cortex was differentially engaged during successful test phase Target and Lure detections. These findings suggest that the entorhinal cortex is involved in the encoding of temporal context information and that the perirhinal cortex is representing the conjunction of item and context during retrieval.",

Since no treatments or vaccines are available to treat COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2, respiratory complications derived from the infections have overwhelmed healthcare systems around the world. This virus is related to SARS-CoV-1, the virus that caused the 2002-2004 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. In January 2020, the Center for Structural Genomics of Infectious Diseases implemented a structural genomics pipeline to solve the structures of proteins essential for coronavirus replication-transcription. Here we show the first structure of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp10-nsp16 2-O-methyltransferase complex with S-adenosylmethionine at a resolution of 1.80 [A]. This heterodimer complex is essential for capping viral mRNA transcripts for efficient translation and to evade immune surveillance.",

CREB1 can regulates tumour cell status of proliferation or migration, however, the molecular basis for this switch involvement in cell plasticity has not been fully understood. Here, we show that knocking out CREB1 triggered a remarkable effect of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and led to the occurrence of inhibited proliferation and enhanced motility in cancer cells. Mechanistically, CREB1-knockout cells showed arrest in the G0/G1 phase as a result of impaired CREB1-dependent transcription of CCAT1 and E2F1. Interestingly, the competition between the coactivator CBP/p300 for CREB1 and p65 leads to the activation of the NF-{kappa}B pathway in cells with CREB1 disrupted, which induces an EMT phenotype and enhances motility. These studies identified previously unknown mechanisms of CREB1 in cell plasticity via its lncRNA and protein effector pathways, revealing an important feature that should be considered in CREB1-targeted tumour therapies.",

Why some tumors heavily recruit nerves while others do not, remains unknown as does the functional contribution of tumor-infiltrating nerves to cancer. Moreover, while patients receive chemotherapeutic treatment, whether these drugs affect nerve recruitment has not been tested. Using a murine model of ovarian cancer, we show that tumor-infiltrating sensory nerves potentiate tumor growth, decrease survival, and contribute to treatment resistance. Furthermore, matched patient samples show significantly increased tumor innervation following chemotherapy. In vitro analysis of tumor-released extracellular vesicles (sEVs) shows they harbor neurite outgrowth activity. These data suggest that chemotherapy may alter sEV cargo, endowing it with robust nerve recruiting capacity.",

Albumin is initially the dominant protein to adsorb to nanobiomaterial surfaces, a process that is considered benign or beneficial by minimizing opsonization or inflammation. Here, we demonstrate the surface chemistry of a model self-assembled nanocarrier can be engineered to stabilize or denature the three-dimensional conformation of adsorbed albumin, which respectively promotes evasion or non-specific clearance in vivo. Interestingly, certain common chemistries that have long been considered to convey stealth properties were found to promote albumin recognition by macrophage class A1 scavenger receptors (SR-A1), providing a means for their eventual removal from systemic circulation. We establish that the surface chemistry of nanocarriers can be specified to modulate adsorbed albumin structure and thereby tune clearance by macrophage scavenger receptors.",

Despite rapid progress, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the \"ecology\" of environmental DNA (eDNA), particularly its temporal and spatial distribution and how this is shaped by abiotic and biotic processes. Here, we tested how seasonal variation in thermal stratification and animal habitat preferences influence the distribution of eDNA in lakes. We sampled eDNA depth profiles of five dimictic lakes during both summer stratification and autumn turnover, each containing warm- and cool-water fishes as well as the cold-water stenotherm, lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush). Habitat use by lake trout was validated by acoustic telemetry and was significantly related to eDNA distribution during stratification. Fish eDNA became \"stratified\" into layers during summer months, reflecting lake stratification and the thermal niches of the species. During summer months, lake trout, which rarely ventured into shallow waters, could only be detected at the deepest layers of the lakes, whereas the eDNA of warm-water fishes was much more abundant above the thermocline. By contrast, during autumn lake turnover, the fish species assemblage as detected by eDNA was homogenous throughout the water column. These findings contribute to our overall understanding of the \"ecology\" of eDNA within lake ecosystems, illustrating how the strong interaction between seasonal thermal structure in lakes and thermal niches of species on very localised spatial scales influences our ability to detect species.",

VERSO exploits an efficient algorithmic strategy to return robust phylogenies from clonal variant profiles, also in conditions of sampling limitations. It then leverages variant frequency patterns to characterize the intra-host genomic diversity of samples, revealing undetected infection chains and pinpointing variants likely involved in homoplasies. On simulations, VERSO outperforms state-of-the-art tools for phylogenetic inference. Notably, the application to 6726 Amplicon and RNA-seq samples refines the estimation of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, while co-occurrence patterns of minor variants unveil undetected infection paths, which are validated with contact tracing data. Finally, the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 mutational landscape uncovers a temporal increase of overall genomic diversity, and highlights variants transiting from minor to clonal state and homoplastic variants, some of which falling on the spike gene.

OA publications tend to receive the largest share of social media attention as measured by the Altmetric Attention Score. 37.6% of OA publications are bronze, which means toll journals are providing free access. MedRxiv contributes to 36.3% of documents in repositories but papers in BiorXiv exhibit on average higher AAS. We predict the growth of COVID-19 literature in the following 30 days estimating ARIMA models for the overall publications set, OA vs. non OA and by location of the document (repository vs. journal). We estimate that COVID-19 publications will double in the next 20 days, but non OA publications will grow at a higher rate than OA publications.

In SARS coronaviruses, the non-structural protein 16 (nsp16) methylates the 5-end of virally encoded mRNAs to mimic cellular mRNAs, thus protecting the virus from host innate immune restriction. We report here the high-resolution structure of a ternary complex of full-length nsp16 and nsp10 of SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of cognate RNA substrate and a methyl donor, S-adenosyl methionine. The nsp16/nsp10 heterodimer was captured in the act of 2-O methylation of the ribose sugar of the first nucleotide of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA. We reveal large conformational changes associated with substrate binding as the enzyme transitions from a binary to a ternary state. This structure provides new mechanistic insights into the 2-O methylation of the viral mRNA cap. We also discovered a distantly located ligand-binding site unique to SARS-CoV-2 that may serve as an alternative target site for antiviral development.",

    "abstract": "Bovine Tuberculosis (bTB) caused by Mycobacterium bovis is a livestock disease of global economic and public health importance. There are currently no effective vaccines available for livestock and so control relies on animal level surveillance and pasteurisation of dairy products. A new alternative control approach is to exploit the genetic variability of the host; recent studies have demonstrated that breeding Bos taurus cattle for increased resistance to bTB is feasible. The utility of such an approach is still unknown for the Bos indicus cattle population. This study aims to assess genetic variation in bTB resistance and the underlying genomic architecture in Bos indicus breeds in Cameroon.\n\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study of slaughter cattle in Cameroon and genotyped a sample of 213 cattle. Their genomic diversity was characterised using PCA, hierarchical clustering and admixture analysis. We assessed genetic variation in bTB resistance using heritability analysis and compared quantitative trait loci.\n\nPrevious studies had found that breed was an important factor in explaining the epidemiology of bTB, with Fulani cattle appearing to be more susceptible than mixed breeds. However, we show that the apparent phenotypic differences in visual appearance between the breeds was not reflected by clear genomic differences. At the genetic level, cattle belonging to different hierarchical genomic clusters differed in their susceptibility to bTB. There was evidence of a genomic association between M. bovis infection status with specific SNPs.\n\nWe highlight the need to understand the challenges faced by livestock in specific settings both in terms of pathogens and the environment, in addition to their intended purpose and how they fit into a defined management system. It is only at this point livestock keepers can then make informed breeding choices, not only for resistance to disease but also for increasing production.",

Colistin is also used in selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD), a prophylactic therapy used in patients hospitalised in intensive care units (ICUs) to selectively eradicate opportunistic pathogens in the oropharyngeal and gut microbiota. In this study, we aimed to unravel the mechanisms of acquired colistin resistance in Gram-negative opportunistic pathogens obtained from SDD-treated patients.\n\nRoutine surveillance of 428 SDD-treated patients resulted in thirteen strains with acquired colistin resistance (Escherichia coli n=9; Klebsiella aerogenes, n=3; Enterobacter asburiae, n=1) from five patients. Genome sequence analysis showed that these isolates represented multiple distinct colistin-resistant clones, but that within the same patients, colistin-resistant strains were clonally related. We identified previously described mechanisms that lead to colistin resistance, i.e. a G53 substitution in the response regulator PmrA/BasR, and the acquisition of the mobile colistin resistance gene mcr-1.1, but we also observed novel variants of basR with an 18-bp deletion, and a G19E substitution in the sensor histidine kinase BasS. We experimentally confirmed these variants to contribute to reduced colistin susceptibility. In a single patient, we observed that colistin resistance in a single E. coli clone evolved through two unique variants in basRS.\n\nWe show that prophylactic use of colistin during SDD can select for colistin resistance in species that are not intrinsically colistin-resistant. This highlights the importance of continued surveillance for the emergence of colistin resistance in patients treated with SDD.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium kansasii is an environmental non-tuberculous mycobacterium that causes opportunistic tuberculosis-like disease. It is one of the most closely related species to the M. tuberculosis complex. Using M. kansasii as a proxy for the M. kansasii-M. tuberculosis-common ancestor, we asked whether introducing the M. tuberculosis-specific gene pair Rv3377c-Rv3378c into M. kansasii affects the course of experimental infection. Expression of these genes resulted in the production of an adenosine-linked lipid species, known as 1-tuberculosinyladenosine (1-TbAd), but did not alter growth in vitro under standard conditions. Production of 1-TbAd enhanced growth of M. kansasii under acidic conditions through a bacterial cell-intrinsic mechanism independent of controlling pH in the bulk extracellular and intracellular spaces. Production of 1-TbAd led to greater burden of M. kansasii in the lung of C57Bl/6 mice during the first 24 hours after infection and ex vivo infections of alveolar macrophages recapitulated this phenotype within the same time frame. However, in long-term infections, production of 1-TbAd resulted in impaired bacterial survival in both C57Bl/6 mice and Ccr2-/- mice. We have demonstrated that M. kansasii is a valid surrogate of M. tuberculosis to study virulence factors acquired by the latter organism, yet shown the challenge inherent to studying the complex evolution of mycobacterial pathogenicity with isolated gene complementation.\n\nIMPORTANCEThis work sheds light on the role of the lipid 1-tuberculosinyladenosine in the evolution of an environmental ancestor to M. tuberculosis. On a larger scale, it reinforces the importance of horizontal gene transfer in bacterial evolution and examines novel models and methods to provide a better understanding of the subtle effects of individual M. tuberculosis-specific virulence factors in infection settings that are relevant to the pathogen.",

Psa biovar 6 (Psa6), which was isolated in Japan in 2015, produces two types of phytotoxins: coronatine and phaseolotoxin. To date, no other phytopathogenic bacteria are known to produce two phytotoxins. To elucidate the unique virulence of Psa6, we performed transcriptomic analysis of phytotoxin synthesis genes and type III effector genes in in vitro cultivation using various media. The genes related to phytotoxin synthesis and effectors of Psa6 were strictly regulated in the coronatine-inducing mediums (HS and HSC); 14 of 23 effector genes and a hrpL sigma factor gene were induced at 3 h after transferring to the media (early-inducible genes), and phytotoxin synthesis genes such as argD of phaseolotoxin and cfl of coronatine were induced at 6 and 12 h after transferring to the media (late-inducible genes). In contrast, induction of these genes was not observed in the hrp-inducing medium. Next, to examine whether the changes in gene expression in different media is specific to Psa6, we investigated gene expression in other related bacteria. For Psa biovar 1 (Psa1), biovar 3 (Psa3), and P. s. pv. glycinea (Psg), no clear trends were observed in expression behavior across various culture media and incubation times. Therefore, Psa6 seems to exert its virulence efficiently by using two phytotoxins and effectors according to environmental changes. This is not seen in other biovars and pathovars, so it is thought that Psa6 has acquired its own balance of virulence.",

    "abstract": "The DNA damage response (DDR) is a signaling cascade that is vital to ensuring the fidelity of the host genome in the presence of genotoxic stress. Growing evidence has emphasized the importance of both activation and repression of the host DDR by diverse DNA and RNA viruses. Previous work has shown that HIV-1 is also capable of engaging the host DDR, primarily through the conserved accessory protein Vpr. However, the extent of this engagement has remained unclear. Here we show that HIV-1 and HIV-2 Vpr directly induce DNA damage and stall DNA replication, leading to the activation of several markers of double- and single-strand DNA breaks. Despite causing damage and activating the DDR, we found that Vpr repress the repair of double-strand breaks (DSB) by inhibiting homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Mutational analyses of Vpr revealed that DNA damage and DDR activation are independent from repression of HR and Vpr-mediated cell-cycle arrest. Moreover, we show that repression of HR does not require cell-cycle arrest but instead may precede this long-standing enigmatic Vpr phenotype. Together, our data uncover that Vpr globally modulates the host DDR at at least two independent steps; offering novel insight into the primary functions of lentiviral Vpr and the roles of the DNA damage response in lentiviral replication.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe DNA damage response (DDR) is a signaling cascade that safeguards the genome from genotoxic agents, including human pathogens. However, the DDR has also been utilized by many pathogens, such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), to enhance infection. To properly treat HIV positive individuals, we must understand how the virus usurps our own cellular processes. Here, we have found that an important yet poorly-understood gene in HIV, Vpr, targets the DDR at two unique steps: it causes damage and activates DDR signaling, and it represses the ability of cells to repair this damage, which we hypothesize is central to the primary function of Vpr. In clarifying these important functions of Vpr, our work highlights the multiple ways human pathogens engage the DDR, and further suggests that modulation of the DDR may be a novel way to help in the fight against HIV.",

TCSs are ubiquitous and participate in numerous cellular functions. TCSs across the ESKAPEE pathogens, representing the leading causes of nosocomial infections, were characterized using pangenome analytics, including annotation, mapping, pangenomic status, gene orientation, sequence variation, and structure. Our findings fall into two categories. 1) phylogenetic distribution of TCSs: (i) the number and types of TCSs varies between species of the ESKAPEE pathogens; (ii) TCSs are group-specific, i.e., Gram-positive and Gram-negative, except for KdpDE; (iii) most TCSs are conserved among genomes of an ESKAPEE, except in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 2) sequence variation: (i) at the operon level, the genomic architecture of a TCS operon stratifies into a few discrete classes; and (ii) at the gene sequence level, histidine kinases, responsible for signal sensing, show sequence and structural variability as compared to response regulators that show a high degree of conservation. Taken together, this first comprehensive pangenomic assessment of TCSs reveals a range of strategies deployed by the ESKAPEE pathogens to manifest pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance. It further suggests that the conserved features of TCSs makes them an attractive group of potential targets with which to address antibiotic resistance.",

In contrast with this prediction, the Wolbachia strain wMelPop drastically reduces its Drosophila melanogaster host lifespan at high rearing temperatures. It is generally assumed that this feature is maintained because the D. melanogaster-wMelPop symbiosis is usually not exposed to environmental conditions in which the symbiont is virulent. To test this hypothesis, we submitted wMelPop-infected D. melanogaster lines to 17 generations of experimental evolution at a high temperature, while enforcing late reproduction by artificial selection. The fly survival was measured at different time points, as well as two traits that have been proposed to be causally responsible for wMelPop virulence: its relative density and the mean number of copies of octomom, an 8-genes region of the Wolbachia genome. We hypothesised that these conditions (high temperature and late reproduction) would select for a reduced wMelPop virulence, a reduced wMelPop density, and a reduced octomom copy number. Our results indicate that density, octomom copy number and virulence are correlated to each other. However, contrary to our expectations, we could not detect any reduction in virulence during the course of evolution. We discuss the significance of our results with respect to the evolutionary causes of wMelPop virulence.",

We simulated the transferring of virulence and antibiotic-resistance genes in a community of interacting people where some take antibiotics. The diversities of the two genes types became positively correlated whenever the contagion probability between two people was higher than the probability of losing resistant genes. However, no such positive correlations arise if no one takes antibiotics. This finding holds even under changes of several simulations parameters, such as the relative or total diversity of virulence and resistance genes, the contagion probability between individuals, the loss rate of resistance genes, or the social network type. Because the loss rate of resistance genes may be shallow, we conclude that the contagion between people and antibiotic usage is the leading cause of establishing the positive correlation mentioned above. Therefore, antibiotic use and something as prosaic as the contagion between people may facilitate the emergence of virulent and multi-resistant bacteria in peoples metagenomes with a high diversity of both gene types. These superbugs may then circulate in the community.",

    "abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevanceEmergence of drug-resistant and multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains is a major barrier to tuberculosis (TB) eradication, as it leads to longer treatment regimens and in many cases treatment failure. Thus, there is an urgent need to explore new TB drugs and combinations, in order to shorten TB treatment and improve outcomes. Here, we evaluate the potential of two medicinal plants, Artemisia annua, a natural source of artemisinin (AN), and Artemisia afra, as sources of novel antitubercular agents.\n\nAim of the studyOur goal was to measure the activity of A. annua and A. afra extracts against Mtb as potential natural and inexpensive therapies for TB treatment, or as sources of compounds that could be further developed into effective treatments.\n\nMaterials and MethodsThe minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of A. annua and A. afra dichloromethane extracts were determined, and concentrations above the MICs were used to evaluate their ability to kill Mtb and Mycobacterium abscessus in vitro.\n\nResultsPrevious studies showed that A. annua and A. afra inhibit Mtb growth. Here, we show for the first time that Artemisia extracts have a strong bactericidal activity against Mtb. The killing effect of A. annua was much stronger than equivalent concentrations of pure AN, suggesting that A. annua extracts kill Mtb through a combination of AN and additional compounds. A. afra, which produces very little AN, displayed bactericidal activity against Mtb that was substantial but weaker than that of A. annua. In addition, we measured the activity of Artemisia extracts against Mycobacterium abscessus. Interestingly, we observed that while A. annua is not bactericidal, it inhibits growth of M. abscessus, highlighting the potential of this plant in combinatory therapies to treat M. abscessus infections.\n\nConclusionOur results indicate that Artemisia extracts have an enormous potential for treatment of TB and M. abscessus infections, and that these plants contain bactericidal compounds in addition to AN. Combination of extracts with existing antibiotics may not only improve treatment outcomes but also reduce the emergence of resistance to other drugs.",

Despite the importance in genetic inheritance, the mechanisms of ParABS-mediated genome partition are not well understood. Combining theory and experiment, we provided evidences that the ParABS system - partitioning via the ParA gradient-based Brownian ratcheting - operates near a critical point in vivo. This near-critical-point operation adapts the segregation distance of replicated plasmids to the half-length of the elongating nucleoid, ensuring both cell halves to inherit one copy of the plasmids. Further, we demonstrated that the plasmid localizes the cytoplasmic ParA to buffer the partition fidelity against the large cell-to-cell fluctuations in ParA level. Thus, the spatial control over the near-critical-point operation not only ensures both sensitive adaption and robust execution of partitioning, but sheds light on the fundamental question in cell biology: How do cells faithfully measure cellular-scale distance by only using molecular-scale interactions?",

    "abstract": "Insulin secretory granules (SGs) mediate the regulated secretion of insulin, which is essential for glucose homeostasis. The basic machinery responsible for this regulated exocytosis consists of specific proteins present both at the plasma membrane and on insulin SGs. The protein composition of insulin SGs thus dictates their release properties, yet the mechanisms controlling insulin SG formation, which determines this molecular composition, remain poorly understood. VPS41, a component of the endo-lysosomal tethering HOPS complex, was recently identified as a cytosolic factor involved in the formation of neuroendocrine and neuronal granules. We now find that VPS41 is required for insulin SG biogenesis and regulated insulin secretion. Loss of VPS41 in pancreatic {beta}-cells leads to a reduction in insulin SG number, changes in their transmembrane protein composition, and defects in granule regulated exocytosis. Exploring a human point mutation, identified in patients with neurological but no endocrine defects, we show that the effect on SG formation is independent of HOPS complex formation. Finally, we report that mice with a deletion of VPS41 specifically in {beta}-cells develop diabetes due to severe depletion of insulin SG content and a defect in insulin secretion. In sum, our data demonstrate that VPS41 contributes to glucose homeostasis and metabolism.",
