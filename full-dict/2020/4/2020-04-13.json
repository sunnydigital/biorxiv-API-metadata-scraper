    "abstract": "Theileria parva is an economically important, intracellular, tick-transmitted parasite of cattle. A live vaccine against the parasite is effective against challenge from cattle-transmissible T. parva but not against genotypes originating from the African Cape buffalo, a major wildlife reservoir, prompting the need to characterize genome-wide variation within and between cattle- and buffalo-associated T. parva populations. Here, we describe a capture-based target enrichment approach that enables, for the first time, de novo assembly of nearly complete T. parva genomes derived from infected host cell lines. This approach has exceptionally high specificity and sensitivity and is successful for both cattle- and buffalo-derived T. parva parasites. De novo genome assemblies generated for cattle genotypes differ from the reference by [~]54K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) throughout the 8.31 Mb genome, an average of 6.5 SNPs/kb. We report the first buffalo-derived T. parva genome, which is larger than the genome from the reference, cattle-derived, Muguga strain. The average non-synonymous nucleotide diversity ({pi}N) per gene, between buffalo-derived T. parva and the Muguga strain, was 1.3%. This remarkably high level of genetic divergence is supported by an average FST, genome-wide, of 0.44, reflecting a degree of genetic differentiation between cattle- and buffalo-derived T. parva parasites more commonly seen between, rather than within, species, with clear implications for vaccine development. The DNA capture approach used provides clear advantages over alternative T. parva DNA enrichment methods used previously and enables in-depth comparative genomics in this apicomplexan parasite.",

    "abstract": "Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient for plant growth. In deciduous trees, P is remobilized from senescing leaves and stored in perennial tissues during winter for further growth. Annual internal recycling and accumulation of P is considered an important strategy to support vigorous growth of trees. However, the pathways of seasonal re-translocation of P and the molecular mechanisms of this transport have not been clarified. Here we show the seasonal P re-translocation route visualized using the real-time radioisotope imaging and the macro- and micro-autoradiography. We analyzed the seasonal re-translocation P in poplar (Populus alba. L) cultivated under \"a shortened annual cycle system\", which mimicked seasonal phenology in a laboratory. From growing to senescing season, sink tissues of 32P and/or 33P shifted from young leaves and the apex to the lower stem and roots. The radioisotope P re-translocated from a leaf was stored in phloem and xylem parenchyma cells and redistributed to new shoots after dormancy. Seasonal expression profile of phosphate transporters (PHT1, PHT5 and PHO1 family) was obtained in the same system. Our results reveal the seasonal P re-translocation routes at the organ and tissue levels and provide a foothold for elucidating its molecular mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Trans-sutural distraction osteogenesis (TSDO) is an important approach to improve mid-face hypoplasia. In recent years, many studies have been carried out on physical mechanisms of TSDO; however, its specific cytological and molecular mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, we performed transcriptome sequencing analysis in Sprague Dawley rats at 1 and 2 weeks after suture osteogenesis and compared RNA expression levels between experimental and control groups. At one week, enrichment pathways were mainly up-regulated in muscle- and bone-related pathways. By contrast, pathways of the immune system showed a state of inhibition and down-regulation, especially for B cells; the main immune pathways showed significant down-regulation. However, two weeks later, the experimental group showed positive up-regulation of the pathways related to DNA synthesis and replication, cell cycle, and chromosome replication. At the same time, the immune pathways that were down-regulated in the first week were up-regulated in the second week. In other words, the up-regulated muscle- and bone-related pathways show opposite trends. The expression of bone- and myogenesis-related transcriptome was up-regulated and the immune-related pathways were down-regulated in the experimental group at 1 week. At 2 weeks, the pathways related to bone- and muscle were down-regulated, while those related to cell cycle regulation and DNA replication were up-regulated. These results suggest that musculoskeletal-related molecules may play an important role during suture osteogenesis at 1 week, and immune regulation may be involved in this process; however, at 2 weeks, molecules related to cell proliferation and replication may be a major role.",

    "abstract": "Cytosolic functions of Long non-coding RNAs including mRNA translation masking and sponging are major regulators of biological pathways. Formation of T cell-bounded hypoxic granuloma is a host immune defence for containing infected Mtb-macrophages. Our study exploits the mechanistic pathway of Mtb-induced HIF1A silencing by the antisense lncRNA-HIF1A-AS2 in T cells. Computational analysis of in-vitro T-cell stimulation assays in progressors (n=119) versus non-progressor (n=221) tuberculosis patients revealed the role of lncRNA mediated disruption of hypoxia adaptation pathways in progressors. We found 291 upregulated and 227 downregulated DE lncRNAs that were correlated at mRNA level with HIF1A and HILPDA which are major players in hypoxia response. We also report novel lncRNA-AC010655 (AC010655.4 and AC010655.2) in cis with HILPDA, both of which contain binding sites for the BARX2 transcription factor, thus indicating a mechanistic role. Detailed comparison of infection with antigenic stimulation showed a non-random enrichment of lncRNAs in the cytoplasmic fraction of the cell in TB progressors. The lack of this pattern in non-progressors replicates indicates the hijacking of the lncRNA dynamics by Mtb. The in-vitro manifestation of this response in the absence of granuloma indicates pre-programmed host-pathogen interaction between T-cells and Mtb regulated through lncRNAs, thus tipping this balance towards progression or containment of Mtb. Finally, we trained multiple machine learning classifiers for reliable prediction of latent to the active progression of patients, yielding a model to guide aggressive treatment.",

    "abstract": "YbbN/CnoX are proteins that display a Trx domain linked to a tetratricopeptide (TPR) domain, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and protein folding processes. YbbN from Escherichia coli (EcYbbN) displays a co-chaperone (holdase) activity that is induced by HOCl (bleach). EcYbbN contains a SQHC motif within the Trx domain and displays no thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase activity. EcYbbN also presents a second Cys residue at Trx domain (Cys63) 24 residues away from SQHF motif that can form mixed disulfides with substrates. Here, we compared EcYbbN with two other YbbN proteins: from Xylella fastidiosa (XfYbbN) and from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaYbbN). While EcYbbN displays two Cys residues along a SQHC[N24]C motif; XfYbbN and PaYbbN present two and three Cys residues in the CAPC[N24]V and CAPC[N24]C motifs, respectively. These three proteins are representatives of evolutionary conserved YbbN subfamilies. In contrast to EcYbbN, both XfYbbN and PaYbbN: (1) reduced an artificial disulfide (5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) = DTNB); and (2) supported the peroxidase activity of Peroxiredoxin Q from X. fastidiosa, suggesting that in vivo these proteins might function similarly to the canonical Trx enzymes. Indeed, XfYbbN was reduced by XfTrx reductase with a high catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km=1.27 x 107 M-1.s-1), like the canonical XfTrx (XfTsnC). Furthermore, EcYbbN (as described before) and XfYbbN, but not PaYbbN displayed HOCl-induced holdase activity. Remarkably, EcYbbN gained disulfide reductase activity while lost the HOCl-activated chaperone function when the SQHC was replaced by CQHC. In contrast, the XfYbbN C40A mutant lost the disulfide reductase activity, while kept its HOCl-induced chaperone function. Finally, we generated a P. aeruginosa strain with the ybbN gene deleted, which did not present increased sensitivity to heat shock or to oxidants or to reductants. Altogether, our results suggest that different YbbN/CnoX proteins display distinct properties and activities, depending on the presence of the three conserved Cys residues.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=91 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/034579v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (11K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6970f0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@75da52org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15067c9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cdd97d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Highlights- CXXC motif is required for the thiol-disulfide reductase activity of YbbN proteins.\n- XfYbbN and PaYbbN display thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase activity\n- The affinities of XfTrxR for XfYbbN and XfTsnC (canonical Trx) are comparable\n- XfYbbN and EcYbbN, but not PaYbbN, display holdase activity induced by hypochlorous acid\n- Engineering EcYbbN/CnoX by inserting a Cys residue in the SQHC motif resulted in a gain of function (thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase activity) and abolished the HOCl-induced holdase activity.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of the cow microbiome, as well as host genetic influences on the establishment and colonization of the rumen microbiota, is critical for development of strategies to manipulate ruminal function toward more efficient and environmentally friendly milk production. To this end, the development and validation of noninvasive methods to sample the rumen microbiota at a large-scale is required. Here, we further optimized the analysis of buccal swab samples as a proxy for direct microbial samples of the rumen of dairy cows. To identify an optimal time for sampling, we collected buccal swab and rumen samples at six different time points relative to animal feeding. We then evaluated several biases in these samples using a machine learning classifier (random forest) to select taxa that discriminate between buccal swab and rumen samples. Differences in the Simpsons diversity, Shannons evenness and Bray-Curtis dissimilarities between methods were significantly less apparent when sampling was performed prior to morning feeding (P<0.05), suggesting that this time point was optimal for representative sampling. In addition, the random forest classifier was able to accurately identify non-rumen taxa, including 10 oral and feed-associated taxa. Two highly prevalent (> 60%) taxa in buccal and rumen samples had significant variance in absolute abundance between sampling methods, but could be qualitatively assessed via regular buccal swab sampling. This work not only provides new insights into the oral community of ruminants, but further validates and refines buccal swabbing as a method to assess the rumen microbiota in large herds.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe gastrointestinal tract of ruminants harbors a diverse microbial community that coevolved symbiotically with the host, influencing its nutrition, health and performance. While the influence of environmental factors on rumen microbes is well-documented, the process by which host genetics influences the establishment and colonization of the rumen microbiota still needs to be elucidated. This knowledge gap is due largely to our inability to easily sample the rumen microbiota. There are three common methods for rumen sampling but all of them present at least one disadvantage, including animal welfare, sample quality, labor, and scalability. The development and validation of non-invasive methods, such as buccal swabbing, for large-scale rumen sampling is needed to support studies that require large sample sizes to generate reliable results. The validation of buccal swabbing will also support the development of molecular tools for the early diagnosis of metabolic disorders associated with microbial changes in large herds.",

    "abstract": "Humans have the ability to store and retrieve memories with various degrees of specificity, and recent advances in reinforcement learning have identified benefits to learning when past experience is represented at different levels of temporal abstraction. How this flexibility might be implemented in the brain remains unclear. We analyzed the temporal organization of rat hippocampal population spiking to identify potential substrates for temporally flexible representations. We examined activity both during locomotion and during memory-associated population events known as sharp wave-ripples (SWRs). We found that spiking during SWRs is rhythmically organized with higher event-to-event variability than spiking during locomotion-associated population events. Decoding analyses using clusterless methods further indidate that similar spatial experience can be replayed in multiple SWRs, each time with a different rhythmic structure whose periodicity is sampled from a lognormal distribution. This variability increases with experience despite the decline in SWR rates that occurs as environments become more familiar. We hypothesize that the variability in temporal organization of hippocampal spiking provides a mechanism for storing experiences with various degrees of specificity.",

Our screen discriminated Rab10 from Rab3. The strongest Rab/LRRK2-G2019S interaction is with Rab10; the weakest with Rab3. Rab10 is expressed in a different set of dopaminergic neurons from Rab3. Thus, anatomical and physiological patterns of Rab10 are related. We conclude that Rab10 is a valid substrate of LRRK2 in dopaminergic neurons in vivo.

    "abstract": "In recent years nidoviruses have emerged as an important respiratory pathogen of reptiles, affecting especially captive python populations. In pythons, nidovirus infection induces an inflammation of the upper respiratory and alimentary tract which can develop into a severe and often fatal proliferative pneumonia. We observed pyogranulomatous and fibrinonecrotic lesions in organ systems other than the respiratory tract during full post mortem examinations on 30 nidovirus RT-PCR positive pythons of varying species originating from Switzerland and Spain. The observations prompted us to study whether the atypical tissue tropism associates with previously unknown nidoviruses or changes in the nidovirus genome. RT-PCR and inoculation of Morelia viridis cell cultures served to recruit the cases and to obtain virus isolates. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining against nidovirus nucleoprotein demonstrated that the virus not only infects a broad spectrum of epithelial (respiratory and alimentary epithelium, hepatocytes, renal tubules, pancreatic ducts etc.), but also intravascular monocytes, intralesional macrophages and endothelial cells. By next-generation sequencing we obtained full length genome for a novel nidovirus species circulating in Switzerland. Analysis of viral genomes recovered from pythons showing nidovirus infection-associated respiratory or systemic disease did not explain the observed phenotypes. The results indicate that python nidoviruses have a broad cell and tissue tropism, further suggesting that the course of infection could vary and involve lesions in a broad spectrum of tissues and organ systems as a consequence of monocyte-mediated systemic spread of the virus.\n\nIMPORTANCEDuring the last years, python nidoviruses have become a primary cause of fatal disease in pythons. Nidoviruses represent a threat to captive snake collections, as they spread rapidly and can be associated with high morbidity and mortality. Our study indicates that, different from previously evidence, the viruses do not only affect the respiratory tract, but can spread in the entire body with blood monocytes, have a broad spectrum of target cells, and can induce a variety of lesions. Nidovirales is an order of animal and human viruses that compromise important zoonotic pathogens such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, as well as the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2. Python nidoviruses belong to the same subfamily as the mentioned human viruses and show similar characteristics (rapid spread, respiratory and gastrointestinal tropism, etc.). The present study confirms the relevance of natural animal diseases to better understand the complexity of viruses of the order nidovirales.",

Here we show that recombinant human dynein can crossbridge neighbouring microtubules and can be activated by this crossbridging to slide and polarity-sort microtubule bundles. While single molecules of human dynein are predominantly static or diffusive on single microtubules, they walk processively for 1.5 m on average along the microtubule bundles they form. Speed and force output of dynein are doubled on bundles compared to single microtubules, indicating that the crossbridging dynein steps equivalently on two microtubules. Our data are consistent with a model of autoactivation through the physical separation of dynein motor domains when crossbridging two microtubules. This enables cytoplasmic dynein to function effectively as a microtubule organiser and transporter without needing to first form a complex with dynactin and a cargo adapter.",

    "abstract": "Plasma cells (PC)s are essential for protection from infection, and at the origin of incurable cancers. Current studies do not circumvent limitations of removing PCs from their microenvironment and confound formation and maintenance. This is in part due to the lack of tools to perform specific genetic manipulation in vivo. Also, studies of PC population dynamics have mostly relied on the use of nucleotide analog incorporation that does not label quiescent cells, a property of most PCs. Here we characterize in detail a genetic tool (JchaincreERT2) that permits first-ever specific genetic manipulation in PC in vivo, across immunoglobulin isotypes. Using this tool we found that PC numbers remained constant over-time and that PC decay was compensated by the emergence of new cells, supporting an homeostatic turnover of the population. The JchaincreERT2 genetic tool paves the way for in-depth mechanistic understanding of PC biology and pathology in vivo, in their microenvironment.\n\nHighlightsJchain expression occurs in most plasma cells across immunoglobulin isotypes\n\nJchaincreERT2 mediated genetic manipulation is effective only in plasma cells\n\nGenetic timestamping of plasma cells reveals homeostatic regulation",

    "abstract": "Single nucleus RNA-Seq (snRNA-Seq) methods are used as an alternative to single cell RNA-Seq methods, as they allow transcriptomic profiling of frozen tissue. However, it is unclear whether snRNA-Seq is able to detect cellular state in human tissue. Indeed, snRNA-Seq analyses of human brain samples have failed to detect a consistent microglial activation signature in Alzheimers Disease. A comparison of microglia from single cells and single nuclei of four human subjects reveals that ~1% of genes is depleted in nuclei compared to whole cells. This small population contains 18% of genes previously implicated in microglial activation, including APOE, CST3, FTL, SPP1, and CD74. We confirm our findings across multiple previous single nucleus and single cell studies. Given the low sensitivity of snRNA-Seq to this population of activation genes, we conclude that snRNA-Seq is not suited to detecting cellular activation in microglia in human disease.",

    "abstract": "Pooling of samples can increase lab capacity when using Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect diseases such as COVID-19. However, pool testing is typically performed via an adaptive testing strategy which requires a feedback loop in the lab and at least two PCR runs to confirm positive results. This can cost precious time. We discuss a non-adaptive testing method where each sample is distributed in a prescribed manner over several pools, and which yields reliable results after one round of testing. More precisely, assuming knowledge about the overall incidence rate, we calculate explicit error bounds on the number of false positives which scale favourably with pool size and sample multiplicity. This allows for hugely streamlined PCR testing and cuts in detection times for a large-scale testing scenario. A viable consequence of this method could be real-time screening of entire communities, frontline healthcare workers and international flight passengers, for example, using the PCR machines currently in operation.",

    "abstract": "Naming a color can be understood as an act of categorization, i.e. identifying it as a member of category of colors that are referred to by the same name. But are naming and categorization equivalent cognitive processes, and consequently rely on same neural substrates? Here, we used task and resting-state fMRI, as well as behavioral measures to identify functional brain networks that modulated naming and categorization of colors. Color naming and categorization response times were modulated by different resting state connectivity networks spanning from the color-sensitive regions in the ventro-occipital cortex. Color naming correlated with the connectivity between the left posterior color region, the left medial temporal gyrus, and the left angular gyrus; whereas color categorization involved the connectivity between the bilateral posterior color regions, the left frontal, right temporal and bilateral parietal areas. The networks supporting naming and categorization did not overlap, suggesting that the two processes rely on different neural mechanisms.\n\nSignificanceWhen we name a color, we also identify it as a member of a color category, e.g. blue or yellow. Are neural processes underlying color categorization equivalent to those of color naming? Here, we address this question by measuring how individual differences in color categorization and naming response times relate to the strength of functional connections in the brain. Color naming speed correlated with left-hemispheric connectivity between the color-sensitive visual regions and the anterior temporal lobe. Color categorization speed was modulated by a different brain network, encompassing bilateral color-sensitive visual areas, and high-level executive and semantic regions. Thus, color categorization and naming performance involved distinct, non-overlapping brain networks, suggesting that the two processes depend on different neural mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The rapid adoption of marmosets in neuroscience has created a demand for three dimensional (3D) atlases of the brain of this species to facilitate data integration in a common reference space. We report on a new open access template of the marmoset cortex (the Nencki-Monash, or NM template), representing a morphological average of 20 brains of young adult individuals, obtained by 3D reconstructions generated from Nissl-stained serial sections. The method used to generate the template takes into account morphological features of the individual brains, as well as the borders of clearly defined cytoarchitectural areas. This has resulted in a resource which allows direct estimates of the most likely coordinates of each cortical area, as well as quantification of the margins of error involved in assigning voxels to areas, and preserves quantitative information about the laminar structure of the cortex. We provide spatial transformations between the NM and other available marmoset brain templates, thus enabling integration with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and tracer-based connectivity data. The NM template combines some of the main advantages of histology-based atlases (e.g. information about the cytoarchitectural structure) with features more commonly associated with MRI-based templates (isotropic nature of the dataset, and probabilistic analyses). The underlying workflow may be found useful in the future development of brain atlases that incorporate information about the variability of areas in species for which it may be impractical to ensure homogeneity of the sample in terms of age, sex and genetic background.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=78 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/036632v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11d61f6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a9156org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cbdc84org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fa738c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIA 3D template of the marmoset cortex representing the average of 20 individuals.\nC_LIO_LIThe template is based on Nissl stain and preserves information about cortical layers.\nC_LIO_LIProbabilistic mapping of areas, cortical thickness, and layer intensity profiles.\nC_LIO_LIIncludes spatial transformations to other marmoset brain atlases.\nC_LI\n\nAbbreviationsFor a list of areas and their abbreviations see Table S2.",

    "abstract": "AimGlioblastoma is an extremely aggressive glioma, resistant to radio and chemotherapy usually performed with temozolomide. One of the main reasons for glioblastoma resistance to conventional therapies is due to the presence of cancer stem-like cells. These cells could recapitulate some signaling pathways important for embryonic development, such as Sonic hedgehog. Here, we investigated if the inhibitor of the Sonic hedgehog pathway, cyclopamine, could potentiate the temozolomide effect in cancer stem-like cells and glioblastoma cell lines in vitro.\n\nMain methodsThe viability of glioblastoma cells exposed to cyclopamine and temozolomide treatment was evaluated by using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay while the induction of apoptosis was assessed by western blot. The stemness properties of glioma cells were verified by clonogenic and differentiation assay and the expression of stem cell markers were measured by fluorescence microscopy and western blot.\n\nKey findingsThe glioblastoma viability was reduced by cyclopamine treatment. Cyclopamine potentiated temozolomide treatment in glioblastoma cell lines by inducing apoptosis through activation of caspase-3 cleaved. Conversely, the combined treatment of cyclopamine and temozolomide potentiated the stemness properties of glioblastoma cells by inducing the expression of SOX-2 and OCT-4.\n\nSignificanceCyclopamine plays an effect on glioblastoma cell lines but also sensibilize them to temozolomide treatment. Thus, first-line treatment with Sonic hedgehog inhibitor followed by temozolomide could be used as a new therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma patients.",

Several phosphopeptide affinity enrichment techniques exist, such as Immobilized Metal ion Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) and Metal Oxide Affinity Chromatography (MOAC). We compared Zirconium (IV) IMAC (Zr-IMAC) magnetic microparticles to more commonly used Titanium (IV) IMAC (Ti-IMAC) and TiO2 magnetic microparticles for phosphopeptide enrichment from simple and complex protein samples prior phosphopeptide sequencing and characterization by mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We optimized sample-loading conditions to increase phosphopeptide recovery for Zr-IMAC, Ti-IMAC and TiO2 based workflows. The performance of Zr-IMAC was enhanced by 19-22% to recover up to 5173 phosphopeptides from 200 {micro}g of protein extract from HepG2/C3A cells, making Zr-IMAC the preferred method for phosphopeptide enrichment in this study. Ti-IMAC and TiO2 performance were also optimized to improve phosphopeptide numbers by 28% and 35%, respectively. Furthermore, Zr-IMAC based phosphoproteomics in the magnetic microsphere format identified 23% more phosphopeptides than HPLC-based Fe(III)-IMAC for same sample amount (200 {micro}g), thereby adding 37% more uniquely identified phosphopeptides. We conclude that Zr-IMAC improves phosphoproteome coverage and recommend that this affinity enrichment method should be more widely used in biological and biomedical studies of cell signalling and in the search for disease-biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "In social species where offspring are reared together in communal burrows or similar structures, young animals typically do not engage in between-group contact during their development - a behavioural trait we call  offspring with restricted between-group contact (ORC). The impact of this trait on the persistence of contagious pathogens that generate lifelong immunity in their hosts is currently unclear. We hypothesize that in populations with ORC, the formation, in groups, of a  protective barrier of only recovered adults, prevents the transmission of this type of pathogens to the new susceptible hosts (i.e. young animals), thereby increasing the probability of epidemic fade-out. We implement a spatially implicit individual-based Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model for a large range of host and pathogen traits and show that the epidemic fade-out probability is consistently higher in populations with ORC, especially when disease spread is fast (high basic reproduction number R0). We also show that ORC can counteract the cost of group-living in terms of disease risk to a greater extent than variation in other traits. We discuss our findings in relation to herd immunity and outline how they could be used to implement efficient management measures such as vaccinations.",

    "abstract": "Latent recurrences following curative-intent pancreatic cancer surgery is a major clinical problem thought to be due to the reactivation of dormant tumor cells that disseminate before the primary tumor has been removed. How dormancy is established and ultimately reversed to drive recurrence is poorly understood. Here we introduce a novel model of pancreatic cancer dormancy that mimics early and latent survival outcomes of resected patients. Using single-cell transcriptomics we compared primary, dormant, and reactivated tumor cells and found the primary and reactivated tumor cell transcriptomes clustered together with and away from the dormant tumor cells. Using a chromatin accessibility assay we found dormancy exhibits large scale changes in chromatin remodeling. Dormant tumor cells express cancer stem cell markers that are lost upon reactivation and are chemotherapy resistant. We identified a dormancy gene signature and investigated this in patients undergoing surgery for localized PC by isolating cells from the primary tumor and liver disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) for single-cell transcriptomics. We found the signature correlated with DTCs indicating that these cells are dormant at the time of surgery. The signature also identified CCL5 as a novel dormancy marker in PC. Mechanisms of PC dormancy include upregulation of the transcriptional repressor Dec2 which drives quiescence, monoallelic suppression of the mutant KRAS allele by DNA methylation, and immunoregulation. We conclude that PC dormancy is a highly plastic and heterogeneous cellular state governed by tumor cell autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA novel model of resectable pancreatic cancer reveals pancreatic cancer dormancy is characterized by significant cellular plasticity, heterogeneity and chromatin remodeling",

    "abstract": "An improved understanding of ecosystem functions is increasingly needed as ecosystem management moves towards optimizing their capacity to provide services to society. Such a task requires the characterization of ecosystem functions in strategic systems such as tropical mountain forests, which are also subject to pressure due to both global and local environmental changes. In particular, transformation of native forests into pastures or agriculture, has been regarded as the type of transformation with the largest effects in ecosystem regulating and provision functions. However, the effects of other transformations such as those associated with replacement of native with planted forests, have been less studied. To evaluate the effect of forest type on key-ecosystem functions related to water resources, we studied the dynamics of rainfall partitioning and nutrient circulation on a suite of representative forest types in neotropical mountain systems: two plantations of exotic fast-growing species and two types of native forests. Our results illustrate that, when considered in a per-basal unit area, water transmission to the forest floor is significantly higher in both native forests. Similarly, native forests are more effective on circulating nutrients on the ecosystem as they are better adapted to oligotrophic soils such as those occurring in tropical mountains. These results suggest that the replacement of native forests with exotic tree plantations can potentially impact hydrological regulation and the nutrient cycling in these high Andean lands, affecting both directly and indirectly the capacity of ecosystems to produce services to society.",

    "abstract": "1The murine intestinal nematode Heligmosomoides polygyrus releases the H. polygyrus Alarmin Release Inhibitor (HpARI) - a protein which binds to IL-33 and to DNA, effectively tethering the cytokine in the nucleus of necrotic cells. Previous work showed that a non-natural truncation consisting of the first 2 domains of HpARI (HpARI_CCP1/2) retains binding to both DNA and IL-33, and inhibited IL-33 release in vivo. Here, we show that the affinity of HpARI_CCP1/2 for IL-33 is significantly lower than that of the full-length protein, and that HpARI_CCP1/2 lacks the ability to prevent interaction of IL-33 with its receptor. When HpARI_CCP1/2 was applied in vivo it potently amplified IL-33-dependent immune responses to Alternaria alternata allergen, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis infection and recombinant IL-33 injection. Mechanistically, we found that HpARI_CCP1/2 is able to bind to and stabilise IL-33, preventing its degradation and maintaining the cytokine in its active form. This study highlights the importance of IL-33 inactivation, the potential for IL-33 stabilisation in vivo, and describes a new tool for IL-33 research.",

    "abstract": "Food-borne illness arising from Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) is often linked to consumption of fruit and vegetables as the bacteria have the ability to interact with plants and use them as alternative or secondary hosts. The initial stages of the interaction involve chemotaxis, attachment and potentially, responding to the early stages of microbe perception by the plant host. We used a high-throughput positive-selection approach to identify early interaction factors of E. coli O157:H7 isolate Sakai to spinach. A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone library was quantified by microarray hybridisation, and gene loci enrichment measured using a Bayesian hierarchical model. The screen of four successive rounds of short-term (2 hour) interaction with spinach roots produced in 115 CDS credible candidates, comprising seven contiguous genomic regions. Two candidate regions were selected for functional assessment: a chaperone-usher fimbrial gene cluster (loc6) and the pO157 plasmid-encoded type two secretion system (T2SS). Interaction of bacteria with spinach tissue was reduced in the absence of the pO157 plasmid, which was appeared to involve the T2SS EtpD secretin protein, whereas loss of loc6 did not impact interactions. The T2SS genes, etpD and etpC, were expressed at a plant-relevant temperature of 18 {degrees}C, and etpD expressed in planta by E. coli Sakai on spinach plants. Thus, a whole genome screening approach using a combination of computational modelling and functional assays has identified a novel function for STEC T2SS in interactions with plant tissue.",

Prefrontal cortex (PFC) is believed to exert top-down control over a range of goal-directed behaviors and is hypothesized to bias sensory-guided movements. However, the nature of PFC involvement in controlling sensory-guided orienting behaviors has remained largely unknown. Here, we trained rats on a delayed two-alternative forced-choice task requiring them to hold an orienting decision in working memory before execution is cued. Medial PFC (mPFC) Inactivation using either Muscimol or optogenetics impaired choice behavior. However, optogenetic impairment depended on the specific trial epoch during which inactivation took place. In particular, we found a lateralized role for mPFC during the presentation of instruction cues but this role became bilateral when inactivation occurred later in the delay period. Electrophysiological recording of multiple single-unit activity further provided evidence that this lateralized selectivity is cell-type specific. Our results suggest a previously unknown role of mPFC in mediating sensory-guided representation of orienting behavior and a potentially distinct cell-type specific role in shaping such representation across time.",

    "abstract": "The transition from controlled drug use to drug addiction depends on an interaction between a vulnerable individual, their environment and a drug. Here we tested the hypothesis that conditions under which individuals live influence behavioral vulnerability traits and experiential factors operating in the drug taking environment to determine the vulnerability to addiction. The role of behavioural vulnerability traits in mediating the influence of housing conditions on the tendency to acquire cocaine self-administration was characterised in 48 rats housed in either an enriched (EE) or a standard (SE) environment. Then, the influence of these housing conditions on the individual vulnerability to develop addiction-like behaviour for cocaine or alcohol was measured in 72 EE or SE rats after several months of cocaine self-administration or intermittent alcohol drinking, respectively. The determining role of negative experiential factors in the drug taking context was further investigated in 48 SE rats that acquired alcohol drinking as a self-medication strategy. The environment influenced the acquisition of drug intake through its effect on behavioral markers of resilience to addiction. In contrast, the initiation of drug taking as a coping strategy or in a negative state occasioned by the contrast between enriched housing conditions and a relatively impoverished drug taking setting, facilitated the development of compulsive cocaine and alcohol intake. These data demonstrate that addiction vulnerability depends on environmentally determined experiential factors, suggesting that initiating drug use through negative reinforcement-based self-medication facilitates the development of addiction in vulnerable individuals.\n\nSignificance StatementThe factors that underlie an individuals vulnerability to switch from controlled, recreational drug use to addiction are not well understood. We showed that in individuals housed in enriched conditions, the experience of drugs in the relative social and sensory impoverishment of the drug taking context, and the associated change in behavioural traits of resilience to addiction, exacerbate the vulnerability to develop compulsive drug intake. We further demonstrated that the acquisition of alcohol drinking as a mechanism to cope with distress increases the vulnerability to develop compulsive alcohol intake. Together these results demonstrate that experiential factors in the drug taking context shape the vulnerability to addiction.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveGut microbiota dysbiosis and aberrant gut-brain functional modules including short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production and long-lasting immune activation (IA) are presented in schizophrenia. Given the key roles of gut microbiota and SCFA in shaping immunity, we propose that dysbiosis-induced SCFA upregulation could contribute to IA and behavioral symptoms in schizophrenia.\n\nDesignGut microbiota, SCFA, and IA biomarkers were compared between schizophrenic patients and healthy controls. The roles of SCFA in schizophrenia-related IA were analyzed in cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and a mouse model of schizophrenia. The effects of SCFAs on schizophrenia-related phenotypes were analyzed in both human and mouse.\n\nResultsBoth microbial-derived SCFA and SCFA-producing bacteria were elevated in the guts of schizophrenic patients, and this increased SCFA production in gut was associated with IA in schizophrenia. The microbiome signature underpinning schizophrenia-related IA includes increased diversity and increased SCFA-producing bacteria and inflammation-associated bacteria. The impact of SCFAs on immune responses of cultured PBMC depend on the diagnosis and IA status of donors. Small-molecule serum filtrates from immune-activated schizophrenic patients increased the inflammatory response of PBMCs from healthy volunteers, which can be enhanced and attenuated by SCFAs supplementation and inhibition of SCFA signaling, respectively. Chronically elevated SCFAs in adolescence induced neuroinflammation and schizophrenia-like behaviors in adult mice. Moreover, chronically elevated SCFAs in adult mice prenatally exposed to IA potentiated their expression of schizophrenia-like behaviors.\n\nConclusionmicrobiota-derived SCFAs are important mediators of dysregulated gut-brain axis and participant in pathogenesis via enhance IA in schizophrenia.\n\nSummaryO_ST_ABSSignificance of this studyC_ST_ABSO_LIWhat is already known about this subject?\n[tpltrtarr]Schizophrenia pathogenesis goes beyond the brain since increasing peripheral abnormalities are revealed including gut microbiota dysbiosis, GI dysfunction, and systemic immune activation (IA).\n[tpltrtarr]Systemic IA/inflammation contributes to the neuroinflammation and brain impairment underlying schizophrenia, and adjunctive immunotherapy can improve psychotic symptoms.\n[tpltrtarr]Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) mediate the microbiota-gut-brain communication and modulate several pathways involved in schizophrenia, including pathways of immunity and neurotransmitters.\n\nC_LIO_LIWhat are the new findings?\n[tpltrtarr]Patients with schizophrenia displayed increased rates of IA and increased SCFA production compared with healthy controls, and increased SCFA is associated with IA in patients.\n[tpltrtarr]A unique microbiota signature including enriched SCFA-producing bacterial species can distinguish patients with IA from other patients and controls.\n[tpltrtarr]Small molecules in the serum of immune-activated patients with schizophrenia enhance LPS-induced immune response of cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs), which is partially mediated by SCFA signaling.\n[tpltrtarr]SCFA intake upregulates both peripheral and brain inflammation and potentiates the expression of schizophrenia-like behaviors in mice prenatally exposed to IA.\n\nC_LIO_LIHow might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future?\n[tpltrtarr]Interference of SCFA signaling or targeted destruction of SCFA-producing bacteria may provide a new approach for the prevention and treatment of schizophrenia.\n[tpltrtarr]Immune activation status of patients should be an important condition considered when selecting immunotherapy for future precision psychiatric therapy.\n\nC_LI",

Another is for neurons to separately encode letter distortions and combinations. Here, we provide evidence for the latter using neural recordings in the monkey inferior temporal (IT) cortex. Neurons encoded letter distortions as a product of letter and distortion tuning, and letter combinations as a sum of letters. These rules were sufficient for perfect CAPTCHA decoding and were also present in neural networks trained for word recognition.

    "abstract": "Erastin, which has been initially identified as a synthetic lethal compound against cancer expressing an RAS oncogene, inhibits cystine/glutamate antiporters and causes ferroptic cell death in various cell types, including therapy-resistant mesenchymal cancer cells. However, despite recent emerging evidence for the mechanisms underlying ferroptosis, molecular biomarkers associated with erastin-dependent ferroptosis have not yet been identified. In the present study, we employed isogenic lung cancer cell models with therapy-resistant mesenchymal properties to show that a redox imbalance leads to glutathione depletion and ferroptotic cell death. Subsequent gene expression analysis of pan-cancer cell lines revealed that the activity of transcription factors, including nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), serve as important markers of erastin resistance. Based on the integrated expression of genes in the nuclear receptor meta-pathway (NRM), we constructed an NRM model and validated its robustness using an independent pharmacogenomics dataset. The NRM model was further evaluated by employing it in the sensitivity testing of nine cancer cell lines for which erastin sensitivities had not yet been undetermined. Our pharmacogenomics approach has the potential to pave the way for the efficient classification of patients for therapeutic intervention using erastin or erastin analogs.",

    "abstract": "The systematic variation of diameters in branched networks has tantalized biologists since the discovery of da Vincis rule for trees. Da Vincis rule can be formulated as a power law with exponent two: the square of the mother branchs diameter is equal to the sum of the squares of those of the daughters. Power laws, with different exponents, have been proposed for branching in circulatory systems and in neurons. The laws have been derived theoretically, based on optimality arguments, but, for the most part, have not been tested rigorously. In the case of neuronal dendrites, diameter changes across branch points have functional implications for the spread of electrical signals: for example, Ralls law with an exponent of 3/2 maximizes propagation speeds of action potentials across branch points. Using a super-resolution method to measure the diameters of all dendrites in highly branched Drosophila Class IV sensory neurons, we have tested Ralls law and shown it to be false. In its place, we have discovered a new diameter-scaling law: the cross-sectional area is proportional to the number of dendrite tips supported by the branch plus a constant, corresponding to a minimum dendrite diameter. The law accords with microtubules providing force and transport for dendrite tip growth. That the observed scaling differs from Ralls law suggests that constraints imposed by cell biological mechanisms may impact electrical signaling in neurons. Our new scaling law generalizes to other branched processes such as the vasculature of plants and the circulatory system of animals.\n\nSignificance StatementTo study the systematic variation of dendrite diameters, we have established a super-resolution method that allows us to resolve dendrite diameters in Drosophila Class IV dendritic arborization neurons, a model cell for studying branching morphogenesis. Interestingly, they do not follow any of the known scaling laws. We propose a new scaling law that follows from two concepts: there is an incremental cross-sectional area needed to support each terminal branch, and there is a minimum branch diameter. The law is consistent with dendrite growing by tip extension and being supported by microtubule-based transport. If the law generalizes to other neurons, it may facilitate segmentation in connectomic studies.",

The cellular distribution of ROS1 has long been assumed at the plasma membrane. However, a previous work reported a differential cellular distribution of mutant ROS1 derived from chromosomal translocation, resulting in increased carcinogenesis. We thus hypothesized that cellular distribution of up-regulated ROS1 in OSCC may correlate with invasiveness. We found that ROS1 can localize to mitochondria in the highly invasive OSCC and identified a mitochondria-targeting signal sequence in ROS1. We also demonstrated that ROS1 targeting to mitochondria is required for mitochondrial fission phenotype in the highly invasive OSCC cells. OSCC cells expressing high levels of ROS1 consumed more oxygen and had increased levels of cellular ATP levels. Our results also revealed that ROS1 regulates mitochondrial biogenesis and cellular metabolic plasticity. Together, these findings demonstrate that ROS1 targeting to mitochondria enhances OSCC invasion through regulating mitochondrial morphogenesis and cellular respiratory.\n\nSummary StatementThis study discovers a new role for the ROS1 in mitochondrial fission and metabolic activities.",

In cultured cells ER protein reflux to the cytosol occurs upon proteostasis perturbation. As such we investigated whether refluxed proteins gain new functions in the cytosol thus providing advantage to tumor cells. Using the ER luminal protein AGR2 as a model, we showed that it is refluxed to the cytosol where it binds and inhibits the tumor suppressor p53.

A rich paleo-records in Deccan Intertrappean bed in India strive to reconcile two contending hypothesis of origin and diversification of Myrtaceae in India, namely Gondwana elements floated on peninsular India or lineages invading from south-east Asia. In this study, we have reconstructed the biogeographic history of Myrtaceae of Western Ghats of India combining fossil-calibrated phylogeny, ancestral area reconstruction, and comparing various dispersal models.\n\nPhylogenetic reconstructions divided lineages into multiple clades at the tribal level that mostly is in agreement with previous descriptions. Dated tree indicated a presumable Gondwanan origin of Myrtaceae (95.7 Ma). The Western Ghats taxa are relatively younger and seem to have arrived either through long-distance oceanic dispersal in middle Eocene (Rhodomyrtus tomentosa), and Miocene (Eugenia) or through major overland dispersals throughout Miocene (Syzygium). However, late Cretaceous fossilsin India lends support to the existence of proto-Myrtaceae on floating peninsular India. Taken together, we conclude that Myrtaceae lineages on the biotic ferry were perhaps extirpated by Deccan volcanism leaving a little or no trace of living Gondwanan link, while the Western Ghats was likely enriched by dispersed elements either from south-east Asia or from South America.",

By integrating a novel mouse model of oncogenic EGFR-driven Trp53-deficient lung adenocarcinoma with multiplexed CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing and tumor barcode sequencing, we quantified the effects of inactivation of ten putative tumor suppressor genes. Inactivation of Apc, Rb1, or Rbm10 most strongly promoted tumor growth. Unexpectedly, inactivation of Lkb1 or Setd2 - which are the strongest drivers of tumor growth in an oncogenic Kras-driven model - reduced EGFR-driven tumor growth. These results are consistent with the relative frequency of these tumor suppressor gene alterations in human EGFR- and KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinomas. Furthermore, Keap1 inactivation reduces the sensitivity of EGFR-driven Trp53-deficient tumors to the EGFR inhibitor osimertinib. Importantly, in human EGFR/TP53 mutant lung adenocarcinomas, mutations in the KEAP1 pathway correlated with decreased time on tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. Our study highlights how genetic alterations can have dramatically different biological consequences depending on the oncogenic context and that the fitness landscape can shift upon drug treatment.",

    "abstract": "The most important role of variant pathogenicity predictors is to identify the disease-phenotype causative variant in studying monogenic diseases. In the last decade, machine-learning based predictors exhibited a relatively accurate performance for distinguishing the pathogenic variants and contributed a significant role for all disease-spectrums. Yet, few predictors can investigate the phenotypic significance of variants. Here we presented a phenotype-specific framework aimed to directly point out the phenotypic significance of predicted candidates, and showed its advancing performance in eye abnormalities. By training on eye-abnormalities causative variants, our method presented 96.2% accuracy, 96.1% precision, 93.4% recall for pathogenicity identification. Inconsistent with the modeling performance, identifying the single phenotype-causative variant from various sequencing variants is challenging for all predictors. Underlying the phenotype-oriented, our method significantly promoted the precision and reduced the cost for identifying the single causative variant from thousands of candidates. These advances highlight the significance of the phenotype-specific training method for studying disease.",

    "abstract": "Genomic imprinting causes alleles to influence the phenotype in a parent-of-origin-specific manner. In attempts to determine the effects of imprinted loci, gametic relationship matrices have widely been used in pedigree-based parent-of-origin analyses of population data. One drawback of this is the size of these matrices because they represent each individual by two gametic effects. Significantly fewer equations are needed if a previously published reduced imprinting model is used that relates observations from progeny without its own offspring to the transmitting abilities of their parents. This can be accomplished using a numerator relationship matrix, with only a single row and column per parent and ancestors. However, the reduced model is not applicable when the parents have records. To better handle the curse of dimensionality, we propose a combination of average gametic effects (transmitting abilities) for individuals without their own records and single gametic effects for others. The generalized gametic relationship matrix is the covariance of this mixture of genetic effects that allows for a significant reduction in the number of equations in gametic models depending on the trait, depth of pedigree, and population structure. It can also render the reduced model much more flexible by including observations from parents. Rules for setting-up its inverse from a pedigree are derived and implemented on an open-source program. The application of the same principles to phased marker data leads to a genomic version of the generalized gametic relationships. The implementation of generalized gametic models to the ASReml package is illustrated through worked examples.",

    "abstract": "Proteins, under conditions of cellular stress, typically tend to unfold and form lethal aggregates leading to neurological diseases like Parkinsons and Alzheimers. A clear understanding of the conditions that favor dis-aggregation and restore the cell to its healthy state after they have been stressed is therefore important in dealing with these diseases. The heat shock response (HSR) mechanism is a signaling network that deals with these undue protein aggregates and aids in the maintenance of homeostasis within a cell. This framework, on its own, is a mathematically well studied mechanism. However, not much is known about how the various intermediate mis-folded protein states of the aggregation process interact with some of the key components of the HSR pathway such as the Heat Shock Protein (HSP), the Heat Shock transcription Factor (HSF) and the HSP-HSF complex. In this article, using kinetic parameters from the literature, we propose and analyze two mathematical models for HSR that also include explicit reactions for the formation of protein aggregates. Deterministic analysis and stochastic simulations of these models show that the folded proteins and the misfolded aggregates exhibit bistability in a certain region of the parameter space. Further, the models also highlight the role of HSF and the HSF-HSP complex in reducing the time lag of response to stress and in re-folding all the mis-folded proteins back to their native state. These models therefore call attention to the significance of studying related pathways such as the HSR and the protein aggregation and re-folding process in conjunction with each other.",

    "abstract": "Most phylogenetic analyses assume that a single evolutionary history underlies one gene. However, both biological processes and errors in dataset assembly can violate this assumption causing intragenic conflict. The extent to which this conflict is present in empirical datasets is not well documented. However, if common, it would have far-reaching implications for phylogenetic analyses. Here, we examined several large phylogenomic datasets from diverse taxa using a fast and simple method to identify well supported intragenic conflict. We found conflict to be highly variable between datasets, from 1% to more than 92% of genes investigated. To better characterize patterns of conflict, we analyzed four genes with no obvious data assembly errors in more detail. Analyses on simulated data highlighted that alignment error may be one major source of conflict. Whether as part of data analysis pipelines or in order to explore potential biologically compelling intragenic processes, analyses of within gene signal should become common. The method presented here provides a relatively fast means for identifying conflicts that is agnostic to the generating process. Datasets identified with high intragenic conflict may either have significant errors in dataset assembly or represent conflict generated by biological processes. Conflicts that are the result of error should be identified and discarded or corrected. For those conflicts that are the result of biological processes, these analyses contribute to the growing consensus that, similar to genomes, genes themselves may exhibit multiple conflicting evolutionary histories across the tree of life.",

    "abstract": "Metastasis is widely accepted to be responsible for approximately 90% of all cancer deaths. Current research on metastasis prediction often centers on gene sequencing; however, these analyses must account for the complexity of gene regulation and rely on comprehensive datasets. To investigate the process from a simpler, non-genomic angle, some studies indicate differences in cell adhesion force, an important physical process in metastasizing cells. However, cell adhesion force methods tend to focus on cell population approaches and therefore have their drawbacks in cost or efficiency, rendering them impractical outside a research setting. In this work, we test a novel and inexpensive bead-pipette assay to investigate the adhesion forces of non-metastatic NIH3T3 cells and mutated RasV12 cells, a metastatic model cell line.\n\nControl cells and RasV12 cells were evaluated with wound healing, spreading area, and focal adhesion (FA) analysis assays. Then cells were tested by the novel bead-pipette assay, which uses a fibronectin-coated bead and a glass micropipette to measure cell adhesion force using Hookes law.\n\nThe RasV12 cells had faster migration, polarized cell shape, and smaller FA area than control cells. The RasV12 cells also exerted higher adhesion forces than control cells and a potential force threshold was determined for distinguishing metastatic cells through a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. An ROC curve was computed for all other assays and the bead-pipette assay was shown to perform higher as a classifier than other assays.\n\nThe RasV12 cells had increased metastatic potential compared to control. The novel bead-pipette assay showed potential as a classifier for determining metastasizing cells from non-metastatic cells. With further work, it may serve as a clinical diagnostic tool for cancer patients or as a testbed to be used in the development of anti-metastatic drugs.",

We found that DRP1 is essential for the induction of the early phase of adipogenic transcriptional program. Intriguingly, inhibition of DRP1 is dispensable following the induction of adipogenesis and adipogenesis-associated mitochondrial biogenesis.

In the current study we show that rhesus macaques seroconverted rapidly after a single intramuscular vaccination with ChAdOx1 MERS. Upon MERS-CoV challenge vaccinated animals were protected against respiratory injury and pneumonia and had a reduction in viral load in lung tissue of several logs. Furthermore, we did not detect MERS-CoV replication in type I and II pneumocytes of ChAdOx1 MERS vaccinated animals. A prime-boost regimen of ChAdOx1 MERS boosted antibody titers, and viral replication was completely absent from the respiratory tract tissue of these rhesus macaques. Finally, we investigated the ability of ChAdOx1 MERS to protect against six different MERS-CoV strains, isolated between 2012 to 2018, from dromedary camels and humans in the Middle East and Africa. Antibodies elicited by ChAdOx1 MERS in rhesus macaques were able to neutralize all MERS-CoV strains.

    "abstract": "Severe systemic bacterial infections result in colonization of deep tissues, which can be very difficult to eliminate with antibiotics. It remains unclear if this is because antibiotics are not reaching inhibitory concentrations within tissues, if subsets of bacteria are less susceptible to antibiotics, or if both contribute to limited treatment efficacy. To determine the concentration of doxycycline (Dox) present within deep tissues following treatment, we generated a fluorescent transcriptional reporter derived from the tet operon to specifically detect intracellular tetracycline exposure at the single bacterial cell level. Dox exposure was detected in the spleen 2 hours after intraperitoneal injection, and by 4 hours post-injection, this treatment resulted in a significant decrease in viable Yersinia pseudotuberculosis in the spleen. Nitric oxide-stressed bacteria preferentially survived treatment, suggesting stress was sufficient to alter Dox susceptibility. Many bacteria (~10%) survived a single dose of Dox, and the antibiotic accumulated at the periphery of microcolonies to growth inhibitory concentrations until 48 hours post-treatment. After this timepoint, antibiotic concentrations decreased and bacterial growth resumed. Dox-treated mice eventually succumbed to the infection, albeit with significantly prolonged survival relative to untreated mice. These results indicate that Dox delivery by intraperitoneal injection results in rapid diffusion of inhibitory concentrations of antibiotic into the spleen, but stressed cells preferentially survive drug treatment, and bacterial growth resumes once drug concentrations decrease. This fluorescent reporter strategy for antibiotic detection could easily be modified to detect the concentration of additional antimicrobial compounds within host tissues following drug administration.\n\nImportanceBacterial infections are very difficult to treat when bacteria spread into the bloodstream and begin to replicate within deep tissues, such as the spleen. Subsets of bacteria can survive antibiotic treatment, but it remains unclear if this survival is because of limited drug diffusion into tissues, or if something has changed within the bacteria, promoting survival of some bacterial cells. Here, we have developed a fluorescent reporter to detect doxycycline (Dox) diffusion into host tissues, and show that Dox impacts the bacterial population within hours of administration, and inhibits bacterial growth for 48 hours. However, bacterial growth resumes when antibiotic concentrations decrease. Subsets of bacteria, stressed by the host response to infection, survive Dox treatment at a higher rate. These results provide critical information about the dynamics that occur within deep tissues following antibiotic administration, and suggests subsets of bacteria are predisposed to survive inhibitory concentrations of antibiotic before exposure.",

We trained individuals in mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR; a standardized MBAT intervention) and compared performance and brain activity before and after training between randomly assigned trained and untrained control groups. The MBAT group showed reliably faster learning of BCI than the control group throughout training. Alpha-band activity in EEG signals, recorded in the volitional resting state during task performance, showed a parallel increase over sessions, and predicted final BCI performance. The level of alpha-band activity during the intentional resting state correlated reliably with individuals mindfulness practice as well as performance on a sustained attention task. Collectively, these results show that MBAT modifies a specific neural signal used by BCI. MBAT, by increasing patients control over their brain activity during rest, may increase the effectiveness of BCI in the large population who could benefit from alternatives to direct motor control.",

It is currently unknown whether TMR reinforced by simultaneous tDCS has superior efficacy. In this study, we investigated the complementary effect of TMR and bilateral tDCS on the consolidation of emotionally neutral and negative declarative memories. Participants learned neutral and negative word pairs. Each word pair was presented with an emotionally compatible sound. Following learning, participants spent a 20-minutes retention interval awake under 4 possible conditions: (1) TMR alone (i.e. replay of 50% of the associated sounds), (2) TMR combined with anodal stimulation of the left DLPFC, (3) TMR combined with anodal stimulation of the right DLPFC and (4) TMR with sham tDCS. Results evidenced selective memory enhancement for the replayed stimuli in the TMR-only and TMR-sham conditions, which confirms a specific effect of TMR on memory. However, memory was enhanced at higher levels for all learned items (irrespective of TMR) in the TMR-anodal right and TMR-anodal left tDCS conditions, suggesting that the beneficial effects of tDCS overshadow the specific effects of TMR. Emotionally negative memories were not modulated by tDCS hemispheric polarity. We conclude that electrical stimulation of the DLPFC during post-learning period globally benefits memory consolidation, but does not potentiate the specific benefits of TMR.",

In general, tobamoviruses lack any poly(A) tail at their 3 prime untranslated region (UTR) which forms a tRNA like structure and upstream pseudoknot domain except tow viruses viz., Hibiscus latent Fort Pierce virus (HLFPV) and Hibiscus latent Singapore virus (HLSV) which accommodate internal poly(A) sequences of 46 and 87 nucleotides long, respectively in their 3 prime UTR. However, determination of full nucleotide sequence of Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) using an oligo(dT)18 primed cDNA as template indicated the libertinism of oligo(dT)18 in priming cDNA synthesis of RNA template which are known to lack poly(A) tail. at the end or internally at its 3 prime end. Moreover, coat protein (CP) gene of PMMoV and bean common mosaic virus (BCMV) (Potyvirus with a poly(A) tract at its 3 prime end) was amplified using cDNA primed with random primer as well as oligo(dT)18 was successfully amplified but with significant variation in the intensity of the amplification band in case of PMMoV but not in BCMV. This clearly indicated the presence of PMMoV mRNA with polyadenylated 3 prime tail in total RNA isolated from PMMoV infected capsicum leaves with abundance of non-polyadenylated PMMoV genomic RNA (gRNA). Hence, we hypothesize that the generation of polyadenylated RNA population during the infection cycle of PMMoV in pepper may be possible reason for libertinism of oligo(dT)18 in priming cDNA synthesis of RNA template isolated from PMMoV infected leaves followed by amplification of entire PMMoV genome through RT-PCR. This is first study indicating the presence of polyadenylated or polyadenylated rich regions in PMMoV gRNA acquired during the infection cycle in pepper.",

    "abstract": "Transfer RNAs (tRNA) are crucial adaptor molecules between messenger RNA (mRNA) and amino acids. Recent evidence in plants suggests that dicistronic tRNA-like structures also act as mobile signals for mRNA transcripts to move between distant tissues. Co-transcription is not a common feature in the plant nuclear genome and, in the few cases where polycistronic transcripts have been found, they include non-coding RNA species such as small nucleolar RNAs and microRNAs. It is not known, however, the extent to which dicistronic transcripts of tRNA and mRNAs are expressed in field-grown plants, or the factors contributing to their expression. We analysed tRNA-mRNA dicistronic transcripts in the major horticultural crop grapevine (Vitis vinifera) using a novel pipeline developed to identify dicistronic transcripts from high-throughput RNA sequencing data. We identified dicistronic tRNA-mRNA in leaf and berry samples from 22 commercial vineyards. Of the 124 tRNA genes that were expressed in both tissues, 18 tRNA were expressed forming part of 19 dicistronic tRNA-mRNAs. The presence and abundance of dicistronic molecules was tissue and geographic sub-region specific. In leaves, the expression patterns of dicistronic tRNA-mRNAs significantly correlated with tRNA expression, suggesting that their transcriptional regulation might be linked. We also found evidence of syntenic genomic arrangements of tRNAs and protein coding genes between grapevine and Arabidopsis thaliana, and widespread prevalence of dicistronic tRNA-mRNA transcripts among vascular land plants but no evidence of these transcripts in nonvascular lineages. This suggests that the appearance of plant vasculature and tRNA-mRNA occurred concurrently during the evolution of land plants.",

    "abstract": "The biomanufacturing of D-glucaric acid has been attracted increasing interest and the industrial yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is regarded as an excellent host for D-glucaric acid production. Here we constructed the biosynthetic pathway of D-glucaric acid in S. cerevisiae INVSc1 whose opi1 was knocked out and obtained two engineered strains, LGA-1 and LGA-C, producing record breaking titers of D-glucaric acid, 9.53 {+/-} 0.46 g/L and 11.21 {+/-} 0.63 g/L D-glucaric acid from 30 g/L glucose and 10.8 g/L myo-inositol in the mode of fed-batch fermentation, respectively. Due to the genetic stability and the outperformance in subsequent applications, however, LGA-1 was a preferable strain. As one of the top chemicals from biomass, there have been no reports on D-glucaric acid production from lignocellulose, which is the most abundant renewable on earth. Therefore, the biorefinery processes of lignocellulose for D-glucaric acid production including separated hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF), simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) and consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) were investigated in this work and CBP by an artificial microbial consortium composed of Trichoderma reesei Rut-C30 and S. cerevisiae LGA-1 was found to have relatively high D-glucaric acid titers and yields after 7 d fermentation, 0.54 {+/-} 0.12 g/L D-glucaric acid from 15 g/L Avicel, and 0.45 {+/-} 0.06 g/L D-glucaric acid from 15 g/L steam exploded corn stover (SECS), respectively. In attempts to design the microbial consortium for more efficient CBP the team consisted of the two members, T. reesei Rut-C30 and S. cerevisiae LGA-1, was found to be the best with excellent work distribution and collaboration. This desirable and promising approach for direction production of D-glucaric acid from lignocellulose deserves extensive and in-depth research.",

    "abstract": "Time-lapse microscopy provides an unprecedented opportunity to monitor single-cell dynamics. However, tracking cells for long periods of time remains a technical challenge, especially for multi-day, large-scale movies with rapid cell migration, high cell density, and drug treatments that alter cell morphology/behavior. Here, we present EllipTrack, a global-local cell-tracking pipeline optimized for tracking such movies. EllipTrack first implements a global track-linking algorithm to construct tracks that maximize the probability of cell lineages, and then corrects tracking mistakes with a local track-correction module where tracks generated by the global algorithm are systematically examined and amended if a more probable alternative can be found. Through benchmarking, we show that EllipTrack outperforms state-of-the-art cell trackers and generates nearly error-free cell lineages for multiple large-scale movies. In addition, EllipTrack can adapt to time- and cell density-dependent changes in cell migration speeds, requires minimal training datasets, and provides a user-friendly interface. EllipTrack is available at github.com/tianchengzhe/EllipTrack.",

    "abstract": "The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 epidemic a public health emergency of international concern on March 11th, 2020, and the pandemic is rapidly spreading worldwide. COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which enters human target cells via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We used a number of bioinformatics tools to computationally characterize ACE2 by determining its cell-specific expression in trachea, lung, and small intestine, derive its putative functions, and predict transcriptional regulation. The small intestine expressed higher levels of ACE2 than any other organ. The large intestine, kidney and testis showed moderate signals, whereas the signal was weak in the lung. Single cell RNA-Seq data from trachea indicated positive signals along the respiratory tract in key protective cell types including club, goblet, proliferating, and ciliary epithelial cells; while in lung the ratio of ACE2-expressing cells was low in all cell types (<2.6%), but was highest in vascular endothelial and goblet cells. Gene ontology analysis suggested that, besides its classical role in renin-angiotensin system, ACE2 may be functionally associated with angiogenesis/blood vessel morphogenesis. Using a novel tool for the prediction of transcription factor binding sites we identified several putative binding sites within two tissue-specific promoters of the ACE2 gene. Our results also confirmed that age and gender play no significant role in the regulation of ACE2 mRNA expression in the lung.\n\nIMPORTANCEVaccines and new medicines are urgently needed to prevent spread of COVID-19 pandemic, reduce the symptoms, shorten the duration of disease, prevent virus spread in the body, and most importantly to save lives. One of the key drug targets could be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is a crucial receptor for the corona virus (SARS-CoV-2). It is known that SARS coronavirus infections lead to worse outcome in the elderly and in males. Therefore, one aim of the present study was to investigate whether age or sex could contribute to the regulation of ACE2 expression. We also decided to explore the transcriptional regulation of ACE2 gene expression. Since data on ACE2 distribution is still conflicting, we aimed to get a more comprehensive view of the cell types expressing the receptor of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we studied the coexpression of ACE2 with other genes and explored its putative functions using gene ontology enrichment analysis.",
