    "abstract": "Identifying the genes that contribute to the variability in brain regions involved in language processing may shed light on the evolution of brain structures essential to the emergence of language in Homo sapiens. The superior temporal asymmetrical pit (STAP), which is not observed in chimpanzees, represents an ideal phenotype to investigate the genetic variations that support human communication. The left STAP depth was significantly associated with a predicted enhancer annotation located in the 14q23.1 locus, between DACT1 and KIAA0586, in the UK Biobank British discovery sample (N=16,515). This association was replicated in the IMAGEN cohort (N=1,726) and the UK Biobank non-British validation sample (N=2,161). This genomic region was also associated to a lesser extent with the right STAP depth and the formation of sulcal interruptions, plis de passage, in the bilateral STAP but not with other structural brain MRI phenotypes, highlighting its notable association with the superior temporal regions. Diffusion MRI emphasized an association with the fractional anisotropy of the left auditory fibers of the corpus callosum and with networks involved in linguistic processing in resting-state functional MRI. Overall, this evidence demonstrates a specific relationship between this locus and the establishment of the superior temporal regions that support human communication.",

    "abstract": "Carbapenemases inactivate most {beta}-lactam antibiotics, including carbapenems and have been frequently reported among Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas spp. Traditionally, the horizontal gene transfer of carbapenemase encoding genes (CEGs) has been linked to plasmids. However, given that integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) are possibly the most abundant conjugative elements among prokaryotes, we conducted an in-silico analysis to ascertain the likely role of ICEs in the spread of CEGs among all bacterial genomes (n=182,663). We detected 17,520 CEGs, of which 66 were located within putative ICEs among several bacterial species (including clinically-relevant bacteria as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli). Most CEGs detected within ICEs belong to the IMP, NDM and SPM metallo-beta-lactamase families, and the serine beta-lactamase KPC and GES families. Different mechanisms were likely responsible for acquisition of these genes. The majority of CEG-bearing ICEs belong to the MPFG, MPFT and MPFF classes and often encode resistance to other antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones). This study provides a snapshot of the different CEGs associated with ICEs among available bacterial genomes and sheds light on the underappreciated contribution of ICEs to the spread of carbapenem resistance globally.\n\nAuthor NotesAll supporting data has been provided within the article or through supplementary data files. Supplementary material is available with the online version of this article.\n\nImpact StatementCarbapenems are commonly used to treat severe infections in humans. Resistance is often mediated by carbapenemases. These enzymes degrade carbapenems and are frequently present in plasmids. Here, we demonstrate that common carbapenemase-encoding genes (CEGs) found in clinical isolates (e.g. blaKPC, blaGES, blaIMP, blaNDM, blaVIM) can also be located within integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs). CEG-bearing ICEs belong to three mating-pair formation families. These mobile elements may be particularly important in bacteria where plasmids do not seem to play a significant role in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes, as Pseudomonas spp. This study considerably expands the knowledge of the repertoire of CEGs-bearing ICEs among clinically-relevant bacterial pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli.\n\nData SummaryAll the bacterial genomes scanned in this study have been deposited previously in the National Center for Biotechnology Information genome database and are listed on the supplementary tables.

    "abstract": "Normal brain-aging occurs at all structural levels. Excessive pathophysiological changes in the brain, beyond the normal one, are implicated in the etiology of brain disorders such as severe forms of the schizophrenia spectrum and dementia. To account for brain-aging in health and disease, it is critical to study the age-dependent trajectories of brain biomarkers at various levels and among different age groups.\n\nThe intracranial volume (ICV) is a key biological marker, and changes in the ICV during the lifespan can teach us about the biology of development, aging, and gene X environment interactions. However, whether ICV changes with age in adulthood is not resolved.\n\nApplying a semi-automatic in-house-built algorithm for ICV extraction on T1w MR brain scans in the Dutch longitudinal cohort (GROUP), we measured ICV changes. Individuals between the ages of 16 and 55 years were scanned up to three consecutive times with 3.32{+/-}0.32 years between consecutive scans (N=482, 359, 302). Using the extracted ICVs, we calculated ICV longitudinal aging-trajectories based on three analysis methods; direct calculation of ICV differences between the first and the last scan, fitting all ICV measurements of individuals to a straight line and applying a global linear mixed model fitting. We report statistically significant increases in the ICV in adulthood until the fourth decade of life (average change +0.03%/y, or about 0.5 ml/y, at age 20), and decreases in the ICV afterward (-0.09%/y, or about -1.2 ml/y, at age 55). To account for previous cross-sectional reports of ICV changes, we analyzed the same data using a cross-sectional approach. Our cross-sectional analysis detected ICV changes consistent with the previously reported cross-sectional effect. However, the reported amount of cross-sectional changes within this age range was significantly larger than the longitudinal changes. We attribute the cross-sectional results to a generational effect.\n\nIn conclusion, the human intracranial volume does not stay constant during adulthood but instead shows a small increase during young adulthood and a decrease thereafter from the fourth decade of life. The age-related changes in the longitudinal setup are smaller than those reported using cross-sectional approaches and unlikely to affect structural brain imaging studies correcting for intracranial volume considerably. As to the possible mechanisms involved, this awaits further study, although thickening of the meninges and skull bones have been proposed, as well as a smaller amount of brain fluids addition above the overall loss of brain tissue.",

    "abstract": "For decades, mathematical models of disease transmission have provided researchers and public health officials with critical insights into the progression, control, and prevention of disease spread. Of these models, one of most fundamental is the SIR differential equation model. However, this ubiquitous model has one significant and rarely acknowledged shortcoming: it is unable to account for a diseases true infectious period distribution. As the misspecification of such a biological characteristic is known to significantly affect model behavior, there is a need to develop new modeling approaches that capture such information. Therefore, we illustrate an innovative take on compartmental models, derived from their general formulation as systems of nonlinear Volterra integral equations, to capture a broader range of infectious period distributions, yet maintain the desirable formulation as systems of differential equations. Our work illustrates a compartmental model that captures any Erlang distributed duration of infection with only 3 differential equations, instead of the typical inflated model sizes required by differential equation compartmental models, and a compartmental model that capture any mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis of an infectious period distribution with merely 4 differential equations. The significance of our work is that it opens up a new class of easy-to-use compartmental models to predict disease outbreaks that does not require a complete overhaul of existing theory, and thus provides a starting point for multiple research avenues of investigation under the contexts of mathematics, public health, and evolutionary biology.",

    "abstract": "Increased availability of drug response and genomics data for many tumor cell lines has accelerated the development of pan-cancer prediction models of drug response. However, it is unclear how much between-tissue differences in drug response and molecular characteristics may contribute to pan-cancer predictions. Also unknown is whether the performance of pan-cancer models could vary by cancer type. Here, we built a series of pan-cancer models using two datasets containing 346 and 504 cell lines with MEK inhibitor (MEKi) response and RNA, SNP, and CNV data, and found that, while the tissue-level drug responses are accurately predicted (between-tissue {rho}=0.88-0.98), only 5 of 10 cancer types showed successful within-tissue prediction performance (within-tissue {rho}=0.11-0.64). Between-tissue differences make substantial contributions to the performance of pan-cancer MEKi response predictions, as we estimate that exclusion of between-tissue signals leads to a 22% decrease in performance metrics. In practice, joint analysis of multiple cancer types usually has a larger sample size, hence greater power, than for one cancer type; and we observe that the higher accuracy of pan-cancer prediction of MEKi response is almost entirely due to the sample size advantage. Success of pan-cancer prediction reveals how drug response in different cancers may invoke shared regulatory mechanisms despite tissue-specific routes of oncogenesis, yet predictions in different cancer types require flexible incorporation of between-cancer and within-cancer signals. As most datasets in genome sciences contain multiple levels of heterogeneity, careful parsing of group characteristics and within-group, individual variation is essential when making robust inference.",

Here we study the role of another potentially important factor, synthetic lethality, in cancer risk. Analyzing transcriptomics data in the GTEx compendium we quantify the extent of co-inactivation of cancer synthetic lethal (cSL) gene pairs in normal tissues and find that normal tissues with more down-regulated cSL gene pairs have lower and delayed cancer risk. We also show that the tissue-specificity of numerous tumor suppressor genes is strongly associated with the expression of their cSL partner genes in the corresponding normal tissues. Overall, our findings uncover the role of synthetic lethality as a novel important factor involved in tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "The ribosomes common core, comprised of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and universal ribosomal proteins, connects all life back to a common ancestor and serves as a window to relationships among organisms. The rRNA of the common core is most similar to rRNA of extant bacteria. In eukaryotes, the rRNA of the common core is decorated by expansion segments (ESs) that vastly increase its size. Supersized ESs have not been observed previously in Archaea, and the origin of eukaryotic ESs remains enigmatic. We discovered that the large subunit (LSU) rRNA of two Asgard phyla, Lokiarchaeota and Heimdallarchaeota, considered to be the closest modern archaeal cell lineages to Eukarya, bridge the gap in size between prokaryotic and eukaryotic LSU rRNA. The elongated LSU rRNAs in Lokiarchaeota and Heimdallarchaeota stem from the presence of two supersized ESs, ES9 and ES39. We applied chemical footprinting experiments to study the structure of Lokiarchaeota ES39. Furthermore, we used covariation and sequence analysis to study the evolution of Asgard ES39s and ES9s. By defining the common eukaryotic ES39 signature fold, we found that Asgard ES39s have more and longer helices than eukaryotic ES39s. While Asgard ES39s have sequences and structures distinct from eukaryotic ES39s, we found overall conservation of a three-way junction across the Asgard species that matches eukaryotic ES39 topology, a result consistent with the accretion model of ribosomal evolution.\n\nSignificanceEukaryotes possess longer and more complex ribosomal RNA (rRNA) than Bacteria and Archaea, including eukaryotic-specific rRNA expansion segments (ESs). The origin and evolution of ESs has long remained a mystery. We show that two recently discovered Asgard archaeal phyla, Lokiarchaeota and Heimdallarchaeota, contain large subunit rRNA with ESs are \"supersized\" (>100 nt) compared to all other prokaryotes studied to date. Asgard ESs have distinct structures from eukaryotic ESs, but share a common three-way junction out of which the ES grew. Our findings raise the possibility that supersized ESs existed on the ribosomal surface before the last eukaryotic common ancestor, opening the question of whether ribosomal complexity is more deeply rooted than previously thought.",

This method has revolutionized biology and medicine as it allows controlling cells with high temporal and spatial precision. Optogenetics is typically applied only at short time scales, for instance to study specific behaviors. Optogenetically manipulating behavior also gives insights into physiology, as behavior controls systemic physiological processes. For example, arousal and sleep affect aging and health span. To study how behavior controls key physiological processes, behavioral manipulations need to occur at extended time scales. However, methods for long-term optogenetics are scarce and typically require expensive compound microscope setups. Optogenetic experiments can be conducted in many species. Small model animals such as the nematode C. elegans, have been instrumental in solving the mechanistic basis of medically important biological processes. We developed OptoGenBox, an affordable stand-alone and simple-to-use device for long-term optogenetic manipulation of C. elegans. OptoGenBox provides a controlled environment and is programmable to allow the execution of complex optogenetic manipulations over long experimental times of many days to weeks. To test our device, we investigated how optogenetically increased arousal and optogenetic sleep deprivation affect survival of arrested first larval stage C. elegans. We optogenetically activated the nociceptive ASH sensory neurons using ReaChR, thus triggering an escape response and increase in arousal. In addition, we optogenetically inhibited the sleep neuron RIS using ArchT, a condition known to impair sleep. Both optogenetic manipulations reduced survival. Thus, OptoGenBox presents an affordable system to study the long-term consequences of optogenetic manipulations of key biological processes in C. elegans and perhaps other small animals.",

    "abstract": "Organism abundance is a critical parameter in ecology, but its estimation is often challenging. Approaches utilizing eDNA to indirectly estimate abundance have recently generated substantial interest. However, preliminary correlations observed between eDNA concentration and abundance in nature are typically moderate in strength with significant unexplained variation. Here we apply a novel approach to integrate allometric scaling coefficients into models of eDNA concentration and organism abundance. We hypothesize that eDNA particle production scales non-linearly with mass, with scaling coefficients < 1. Wild populations often exhibit substantial variation in individual body size distributions; we therefore predict that the distribution of mass across individuals within a population will influence population-level eDNA production rates. To test our hypothesis, we collected standardized body size distribution and mark-recapture abundance data using whole-lake experiments involving nine populations of brook trout. We correlated eDNA concentration with three metrics of abundance: density (individuals/ha), biomass (kg/ha), and allometrically scaled mass (ASM) ({sum}(individual mass0.73)/ha). Density and biomass were both significantly positively correlated with eDNA concentration (adj. R2 = 0.59 and 0.63, respectively), but ASM exhibited improved model fit (adj. R2 = 0.78). We also demonstrate how estimates of ASM derived from eDNA samples in  unknown systems can be converted to biomass or density estimates with additional size structure data. Future experiments should empirically validate allometric scaling coefficients for eDNA production, particularly where substantial intraspecific size distribution variation exists. Incorporating allometric scaling may improve predictive models to the extent that eDNA concentration may become a reliable indicator of abundance in nature.",

    "abstract": "During sleep, neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) participate in distinct types of oscillatory activity. While the reciprocal synaptic circuits between TRN and sensory relay nuclei are known to underlie the generation of sleep spindles, the mechanisms regulating slow (<1 Hz) forms of thalamic oscillations are not well understood. Under in vitro conditions, TRN neurons can generate slow oscillations in a cell-intrinsic manner, with postsynaptic Group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) activation leading to the generation of plateau potentials mediated by both T-type Ca2+ currents and Ca2+ -activated nonselective cation currents (ICAN). However, the identity of ICAN and the possible contribution of thalamic circuits to slow rhythmic activity remain unclear. Using thalamic slices derived from adult mice of either sex, we recorded slow forms of rhythmic activity in TRN neurons, which were mediated by fast glutamatergic thalamoreticular inputs but did not require postsynaptic mGluR activation. For a significant fraction of TRN neurons, synaptic inputs or brief depolarizing current steps led to long-lasting plateau potentials and persistent firing (PF), and in turn, resulted in sustained synaptic inhibition in postsynaptic relay neurons of the ventrobasal thalamus (VB). Pharmacological approaches indicated that plateau potentials were triggered by Ca2+ influx through T-type Ca2+ channels and mediated by Ca2+ and voltage-dependent transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4) channels. Taken together, our results suggest that thalamic circuits can generate slow oscillatory activity, mediated by an interplay of TRN-VB synaptic circuits that generate rhythmicity and TRN cell-intrinsic mechanisms that control PF and oscillation frequency.\n\nSignificance StatementSlow forms of thalamocortical rhythmic activity are thought to be essential for memory consolidation during sleep and the efficient removal of potentially toxic metabolites. In vivo, thalamic slow oscillations are regulated by strong bidirectional synaptic pathways linking neocortex and thalamus. Therefore, in vitro studies in the isolated thalamus can offer important insights about the ability of individual neurons and local circuits to generate different forms of rhythmic activity. We found that circuits formed by GABAergic neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) and glutamatergic relay neurons in the ventrobasal thalamus generated slow oscillatory activity, which was accompanied by persistent firing in TRN neurons. Our results identify both cell-intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms that mediate slow forms of rhythmic activity in thalamic circuits.",

    "abstract": "Genetic polymorphisms within the IFNL3/IFNL4 genomic region, which encodes type III interferons, have been strongly associated with impaired clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We hypothesized that type III interferons might be important for the immune response to other pathogens as well. In a cohort of 914 Malian children, we analyzed episodes of malaria, gastrointestinal and respiratory infections using information for 30,626 clinic visits from birth through up to 5 years of follow-up. Genetic polymorphisms IFNL4-rs368234815 and IFNL3-rs4803217 that functionally affect type III interferons were genotyped with TaqMan assays. For both genetic variants and each infection, we evaluated time-to-first episode and calculated odds ratios (ORs) for the risk of an infection episode during follow-up, controlling for relevant covariates. Compared to children with the rs368234815-TT/TT genotype (IFN-{lambda}4-Null), each copy of the rs368234815-dG allele was associated with an earlier first episode of a gastrointestinal infection (p=0.003) and respiratory infection (p=0.045). The risk of experiencing an infection episode during the follow-up was also significantly increased with each copy of the rs368234815-dG allele - for gastrointestinal infections (OR=1.53, 95%CI (1.13-2.07), p=0.005) and malaria (OR=1.30, 95%CI (1.02-1.65), p=0.033). IFNL4-rs368234815 and IFNL3-rs4803217 were in moderate linkage disequilibrium in this population (r2=0.78), and all the associations for rs4803217 were weaker and lost significance after adjusting for rs368234815, implicating IFN-{lambda}4 and not IFN-{lambda}3 as the primary cause of these associations. We conclude that the ability to produce IFN-{lambda}4 may have broad health-related implications by negatively affecting the immune response and clinical outcomes of several common infections.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is a novel highly virulent pathogen which gains entry to human cells by binding with the cell surface receptor - angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2). We computationally contrasted the binding interactions between human ACE2 and coronavirus spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) of the 2002 epidemic-causing SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and bat coronavirus RaTG13 using the Rosetta energy function. We find that the RBD of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is highly optimized to achieve very strong binding with human ACE2 (hACE2) which is consistent with its enhanced infectivity. SARS-CoV-2 forms the most stable complex with hACE2 compared to SARS-CoV-1 (23% less stable) or RaTG13 (11% less stable) while occupying the greatest number of residues in the ATR1 binding site. Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD out-competes the angiotensin 2 receptor type I (ATR1) which is the native binding partner of ACE2 by 35% in terms of the calculated binding affinity. Strong binding is mediated through strong electrostatic attachments with every fourth residue on the N-terminus alpha-helix (starting from Ser19 to Asn53) as the turn of the helix makes these residues solvent accessible. By contrasting the spike protein SARS-CoV-2 Rosetta binding energy with ACE2 of different livestock and pet species we find strongest binding with bat ACE2 followed by human, feline, equine, canine and finally chicken. This is consistent with the hypothesis that bats are the viral origin and reservoir species. These results offer a computational explanation for the increased infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and allude to therapeutic modalities by identifying and rank-ordering the ACE2 residues involved in binding with the virus.",

    "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) are a major type of small RNA that alter gene expression at the post-transcriptional or translational level. They have been shown to play important roles in a wide range of biological processes. Many computational methods have been developed to predict targets of miRNAs in order to understand miRNAs function. However, the majority of the methods depend on a set of pre-defined features that require considerable effort and resources to compute, and these methods often do not effectively on the prediction of miRNA targets. Therefore, we developed a novel hybrid deep learning-based approach that is capable to predict miRNA targets at a higher accuracy. Our approach integrates two deep learning methods: convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that excel in learning spatial features, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that discern sequential features. By combining CNNs and RNNs, our approach has the advantages of learning both the intrinsic spatial and sequential features of miRNA:target. The inputs for the approach are raw sequences of miRNA and gene sequences. Data from two latest miRNA target prediction studies were used in our study: the DeepMirTar dataset and the miRAW dataset. Two models were obtained by training on the two datasets separately. The models achieved a higher accuracy than the methods developed in the previous studies: 0.9787 vs. 0.9348 for the DeepMirTar dataset; 0.9649 vs. 0.935 for the miRAW dataset. We also calculated a series of model evaluation metrics including sensitivity, specificity, F-score and Brier Score. Our approach consistently outperformed the current methods. In addition, we compared our approach with earlier developed deep learning methods, resulting in an overall better performance. Lastly, a unified model for both datasets was developed with an accuracy higher than the current methods (0.9545). We named the unified model miTAR for miRNA target prediction.

    "abstract": "BackgroundAggregative multicellularity has evolved multiple times in diverse groups of eukaryotes. One of the most well-studied examples is the development of dictyostelid social amoebae, e.g. Dictyostelium discoideum. However, it is still poorly understood why multicellularity emerged in these amoebae while the great majority of other members of Amoebozoa are unicellular. Previously a novel type of non-coding RNA, Class I RNAs, was identified in D. discoideum and demonstrated to be important for normal multicellular development. In this study we investigated Class I RNA evolution and its connection to multicellular development.\n\nResultsNew Class I RNA genes were identified by constructing a co-variance model combined with a scoring system based on conserved up-stream sequences. Multiple genes were predicted in representatives of each major group of Dictyostelia and expression analysis validated that our search approach can identify expressed Class I RNA genes with high accuracy and sensitivity. Further studies showed that Class I RNAs are ubiquitous in Dictyostelia and share several highly conserved structure and sequence motifs. Class I RNA genes appear to be unique to dictyostelid social amoebae since they could not be identified in searches in outgroup genomes, including the closest known relatives to Dictyostelia.\n\nConclusionOur results show that Class I RNA is an ancient abundant class of ncRNAs, likely to have been present in the last common ancestor of Dictyostelia dating back at least 600 million years. Taken together, our current knowledge of Class I RNAs suggests that they may have been involved in evolution of multicellularity in Dictyostelia.",

    "abstract": "3D in vitro cancer models are important therapeutic and biological discovery tools, yet formation of multicellular spheroids in a throughput and highly controlled manner to achieve robust and statistically relevant data, remains challenging. Here, we developed an enabling technology consisting of a bespoke drop-on-demand 3D bioprinter capable of high-throughput printing of 96-well plates of spheroids. 3D-multicellular spheroids are embedded inside a tissue-like matrix with precise control over size and cell number. Application of 3D bioprinting for high-throughput drug screening was demonstrated with doxorubicin. Measurements showed that IC50 values were sensitive to spheroid size, embedding and how spheroids conform to the embedding, revealing parameters shaping biological responses in these models. Our study demonstrates the potential of 3D bioprinting as a robust high-throughput platform to screen biological and therapeutic parameters.\n\nSignificance StatementIn vitro 3D cell cultures serve as more realistic models, compared to 2D cell culture, for understanding diverse biology and for drug discovery. Preparing 3D cell cultures with defined parameters is challenging, with significant failure rates when embedding 3D multicellular spheroids into extracellular mimics. Here, we report a new 3D bioprinter we developed in conjunction with bioinks to allow 3D-multicellular spheroids to be produced in a high-throughput manner. High-throughput production of embedded multicellular spheroids allowed entire drug-dose responses to be performed in 96-well plate format with statistically relevant numbers of data points.

    "abstract": "Up to 40% of the world population now live in areas where dengue mosquito vectors coexist with humans. Aedes aegypti are vectors for zoonotic diseases that affect hundreds of millions of individuals per year globally. We recently identified the eggshell organizing factor 1 (EOF1) protein using systematic RNA interference (RNAi) screening of mosquito lineage-specific genes. It was shown that eggs deposited by RNAi-EOF1 A. aegypti and A. albopictus mosquitoes were non-melanized, fragile, and contained nonviable embryos. Motivated by this discovery, we performed RNAi screening of eggshell proteins to determine putative downstream target proteins of intracellular EOF1. We identified several eggshell proteins as essential for eggshell formation in A. aegypti and characterized their phenotypes in detail by molecular and biochemical approaches. We found that Nasrat, Closca, and Polehole structural proteins, together with the Nudel serine protease, are indispensable for eggshell melanization and egg viability. While all four proteins are predominantly expressed in ovaries of adult females, Nudel mRNA expression is highly upregulated in response to blood feeding. Furthermore, we identified four secreted eggshell enzymes as important factors for controlling the processes of mosquito eggshell formation and melanization. These enzymes included three dopachrome converting enzymes and one cysteine protease. All eight characterized eggshell proteins were required for intact eggshell formation. However, their surface topologies in response to RNAi did not phenocopy the effect of RNAi-EOF1. Still, it remains unclear how EOF1 influences eggshell formation and melanization. The use of proteomic analysis of eggshell proteins from RNAi-EOF1 assisted in the identification of additional proteins that could be regulated in EOF1 deficient eggshells.",

Additional host molecules including ADAM17, cathepsin L, CD147, and GRP78 may also function as receptors for SARS-CoV-2.\n\nTo determine the expression and in situ localization of candidate SARS-CoV-2 receptors in the respiratory mucosa, we analyzed gene expression datasets from airway epithelial cells of 515 healthy subjects, gene promoter activity analysis using the FANTOM5 dataset containing 120 distinct sample types, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of 10 healthy subjects, immunoblots on multiple airway epithelial cell types, and immunohistochemistry on 98 human lung samples.\n\nWe demonstrate absent to low ACE2 promoter activity in a variety of lung epithelial cell samples and low ACE2 gene expression in both microarray and scRNAseq datasets of epithelial cell populations. Consistent with gene expression, rare ACE2 protein expression was observed in the airway epithelium and alveoli of human lung. We present confirmatory evidence for the presence of TMPRSS2, CD147, and GRP78 protein in vitro in airway epithelial cells and confirm broad in situ protein expression of CD147 in the respiratory mucosa.\n\nCollectively, our data suggest the presence of a mechanism dynamically regulating ACE2 expression in human lung, perhaps in periods of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and also suggest that alternate receptors for SARS-CoV-2 exist to facilitate initial host cell infection.",

The pathogen also readily acquires resistance to antibiotics, and pan-resistant strains have been reported. A. baumannii is widely regarded as an extracellular bacterial pathogen. However, accumulating evidence demonstrates that the pathogen can invade, survive or persist in infected mammalian cells. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms controlling these processes remain poorly understood. Here, we show that Drosophila S2 cells provide several attractive advantages as a model system for investigating the intracellular lifestyle of the pathogen, including susceptibility to bacterial intracellular replication and limited infection-induced host cell death. We also show that the Drosophila system can be used to rapidly identify host factors, including MAP kinase proteins, which confer susceptibility to intracellular parasitism. Finally, analysis of the Drosophila system suggested that host proteins that regulate organelle biogenesis and membrane trafficking contribute to regulating the intracellular lifestyle of the pathogen. Taken together, these findings establish a novel model system for elucidating interactions between A. baumannii and host cells, define new factors that regulate bacterial invasion or intracellular persistence, and identify subcellular compartments in host cells that interact with the pathogen.",

    "abstract": "There is a pressing clinical need to develop cell-based bone therapies due to a lack of viable, autologous bone grafts and a growing demand for bone grafts in musculoskeletal surgery. Such therapies can be tissue engineered and cellular, such as osteoblasts combined with a material scaffold. Because mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are both available and fast growing compared to mature osteoblasts, therapies that utilise these progenitor cells are particularly promising. We have developed a nanovibrational bioreactor that can convert MSCs into bone-forming osteoblasts in 2D and 3D but the mechanisms involved in this osteoinduction process remain unclear. Here, to elucidate this mechanism, we use increasing vibrational amplitude, from 30 nm (N30) to 90 nm (N90) amplitudes at 1000 Hz, and assess MSC metabolite, gene and protein changes. These approaches reveal that dose-dependent changes occur in MSCs responses to increased vibrational amplitude, particularly in adhesion and mechanosensitive ion channel expression, and that energetic metabolic pathways are activated, leading to low-level reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and to low-level inflammation, as well as to ROS- and inflammation-balancing pathways. These events are analogous to those that occur in the natural bone-healing processes. We have also developed a tissue engineered MSC-laden scaffold designed using cells mechanical memory, driven by the stronger N90 stimulation. These new mechanistic insights and cell-scaffold design are underpinned by a process that is free of inductive chemicals.",

    "abstract": "Human and mouse monocytes are divided into two subpopulations, classical (C-Mo) and non-classical (NC-Mo) monocytes. CC-chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) and CX3C-chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1) are common features of monocyte subsets between humans and mice, i.e., C-Mo and NC-Mo are characterized as CCR2highCX3CR1low and CCR2lowCX3CR1high. Since many studies utilize mouse models to investigate roles of monocytes in human diseases, it is important to understand the similarities and differences between human and mouse monocytic subsets. In this study, we show that the expression of Cx3cr1 mRNA and CX3CR1 cell surface protein are different between circulating monocytic subsets in human but not in mice. We analyzed monocyte subsets in the blood using wild type C57BL/6 and Cx3cr1-GFP knock-in (Cx3cr1GFP/+) reporter mice. We observed higher Cx3cr1 promoter activity indicated by GFP expression in NC-Mo compared to C-Mo. However, there were no differences between the subsets in CX3CR1 mRNA nor surface protein expression determined by anti-CX3CR1 antibody or binding of fluorophore-conjugated ligand. However in the bone marrow of Cx3cr1GFP/+ mice, CX3CR1 expression was higher in NC-Mo compared to C-Mo, suggesting that mouse NC-Mo express higher level of CX3CR1 than C-Mo in the bone but this difference disappears in the blood. In contrast, human NC-Mo differentially expressed CX3CR1 compared to C-Mo in both blood and bone marrow. Given these findings, the discrepancy between promoter activity and protein levels should be considered when the roles of CX3CR1 are investigated in mouse models of human diseases.\n\nSummary sentenceIn this study, we show that the expression of Cx3cr1 mRNA is different between circulating monocytic subsets in human but not in mice.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein mediates entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells expressing the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The S protein engages ACE2 through its receptor-binding domain (RBD), an independently folded 197-amino acid fragment of the 1273-amino acid S-protein protomer. Antibodies to the RBD domain of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1), a closely related coronavirus which emerged in 2002-2003, have been shown to potently neutralize SARS-CoV-1 S-protein-mediated entry, and the presence of anti-RBD antibodies correlates with neutralization in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent sera. Here we show that immunization with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD elicits a robust neutralizing antibody response in rodents, comparable to 100 {micro}g/ml of ACE2-Ig, a potent SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitor. Importantly, anti-sera from immunized animals did not mediate antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of S-protein-mediated entry under conditions in which Zika virus ADE was readily observed. These data suggest that an RBD-based vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 could be safe and effective.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, has recently been announced as a pandemic all over the world. Plenty of diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic knowledges have been enriched from clinical studies since December 2019. However, animal models, particularly non-human primate models, are urgently needed for critical questions that could not be answered in clinical patients, evaluations of anti-viral drugs and vaccines. In this study, two families of non-human primates, Old world monkeys (12 Macaca mulatta, 6 Macaca fascicularis) and New world monkeys (6 Callithrix jacchus), were experimentally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2. Clinical signs were recorded. Samples were collected for analysis of viral shedding, viremia and histopathological examination. Increased body temperature was observed in 100% (12/12) M. mulatta, 33.3% (2/6) M. fascicularis and none (0/6) of C. jacchus post inoculation of SARS-CoV-2. All of M. mulatta and M. fascicularis showed chest radiographic abnormality. Viral genomes were detected in nasal swabs, throat swabs, anal swabs and blood from all 3 species of monkeys. Viral shedding from upper respiratory samples reached the peak between day 6 and day 8 post inoculation. From necropsied M. mulatta and M. fascicularis, the tissues showing virus positive were mainly lung, weasand, bronchus and spleen. No viral genome was seen in any of tissues from 2 necropsied C. jacchus. Severe gross lesions and histopathological changes were observed in lung, heart and stomach of SARS-CoV-2 infected animals. In summary, we have established a NHP model for COVID-19, which could be used to evaluate drugs and vaccines, and investigate viral pathogenesis. M. mulatta is the most susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, followed by M. fascicularis and C. jacchus.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryM. mulatta is the most susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to M. fascicularis and C. jacchus.",

    "abstract": "This is a longitudinal study comprising 649 Escherichia coli (EC) isolates representing all 7165 EC-BSI episodes recorded in a hospital (1996-2016). Strains analysis included clonal identification (phylogenetic groups/subgroups, STc131 subclades, PFGE, and WGS), antibiotic susceptibility (13 antibiotics), and virulence-associated genes (VAGs, 29 genes). The incidence of BSI-EC increased from 1996 to 2016 (5.5 to 10.8 BSI episodes/1000 hospitalizations, average 7-8/1000). B2 isolates predominate (53%), subgroups B2-I (STc131), B2-II, B2-IX, and B2-VI representing 25%, 25%, 14%, and 9%, respectively. Intertwined waves of community-acquired (CA) + healthcare-associated and community-onset healthcare-associated (HCA), and hospital-acquired (HA) episodes of both B2 and non-B2 phylogroups occurred. A remarkable increase was only observed for B2-I-STc131 (C1/C2 subclades), with oscillations for other B2 subgroups and phylogroups throughout the years. Epidemic and persistent clones (comprising isolates with highly similar/identical-PFGE types and genomes differing in 18-97 SNPs) of B2-I (STc131), B2-II (STc73), B2-III (STc127), B2-IX (STc95), and B2-VI (STc12) were recovered from different patients, most at hospital admission, for long periods (2-17 years), ESBL producers or resistance to ciprofloxacin in B2 isolates were almost restricted to B2-I (STc131) subclade C. STc131 contributed to increasing the B2 rates but only transiently altered the EC-population structure.\n\nThe increase of EC-BSI was determined by waves of CA+HCA-BSI episodes that predate the waves of HA-BSI. Besides the risk of hospital transmission that led to temporal increases in BSIs, this study suggests that EC-populations/clones from community-based healthy individuals may occasionally have an epidemic structure and provide a source of transmissible strains influencing the HA-BSIs incidence.\n\nIMPORTANCESepsis is the third cause of mortality in Western countries and one of the Global Health threads recognized by the WHO since 2017. Despite Escherichia coli constitutes the most common cause of bloodstream infections (BSI), its epidemiology is not fully understood, in part due to the scarcity of local and longitudinal studies. Our work analyzes the long-term dynamics of E. coli causing bacteremia in a single institution and reveals waves of different clonal lineages that emerge periodically and successfully spread afterward in both the community and hospitals. Because the origin of BSI-E. coli infections is the gut, the microbiota of healthy individuals might occasionally have an epidemic structure, providing a source of E. coli strains to influence the incidence of hospital BSIs. The study complements previous fractionated observations focusing on specific E. coli lineages or antibiotic-resistant isolates in the last decades and helps to understand the epidemiology of E. coli BSIs and the dynamics of pandemic clones.",

    "abstract": "Endocytosis mediates the cellular uptake of micronutrients and cell surface proteins. Parallel to Clathrin-mediated endocytosis, additional Clathrin-independent endocytic routes exist, including fast Endophilin-mediated endocytosis (FEME). The latter is not constitutively active but requires the activation of selected receptors. In cell culture, however, the high levels of growth factors in the regular culture media induce spontaneous FEME, which can be suppressed upon serum starvation. Thus, we predicted a role for protein kinases in this growth factor receptor-mediated regulation of the pathway. Using chemical and genetic inhibition, we found that Cdk5 and GSK3{beta} are negative regulators of FEME. Their inhibition was sufficient to activate FEME promptly in resting cells and boosted the production of endocytic carriers containing {beta} 1-adrenergic receptor, following dobutamine addition. We established that the kinases suppress FEME at several levels. They control Dynamin-1 and Dynein recruitment and sorting of cargo receptors such as Plexin A1 and ROBO1 into FEME carriers. They do so by antagonizing the binding of Endophilin to Dynamin-1 as well as to Collapsin response mediator protein 4 (CRMP4), a Plexin A1 adaptor. Cdk5 and GSK3{beta} also hamper the binding and recruitment of Dynein onto FEME carriers by Bin1. Interestingly, we found that GSK3{beta} binds to Endophilin, thus imposing a local regulation of FEME. Collectively, these findings place the two kinases as key regulators of FEME, licensing cells for rapid uptake by the pathway only upon when Cdk5 and GSK3{beta} activity is low.",

    "abstract": "Expansion of interstitial cells in the adult kidney is a hallmark of chronic disease, whereas their proliferation during fetal development is necessary for organ formation. An intriguing difference between adult and neonatal kidneys is that the neonatal kidney has the capacity to control interstitial cell proliferation when the target number has been reached. In this study, we define the consequences of inactivating the TGF{beta}/Smad response in the interstitial cell lineage. We find that pathway inactivation through loss of Smad4 leads to over-proliferation of interstitial cells regionally in the kidney medulla. Genetic and molecular interaction studies showed that Smad3/4 participates in the Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling pathway, which is responsible for promoting proliferation of interstitial cells. Specifically, Smad4 is required for the expression of the Wnt feedback inhibitor Apcdd1, and based on these findings we propose a model for interstitial cell proliferation control in which the Wnt/{beta}-catenin proliferative signal is attenuated by TGF{beta}/Smad signaling to ensure that proliferation ceases when the target number of interstitial cells has been reached in the neonatal medulla.\n\nSummary statementThis study describes a novel function for TGF{beta} signaling in the developing renal interstitium. Mice with Foxd1-Cre-mediated deletion of Smad4 have interstitial expansion and activated Wnt signaling.",

    "abstract": "Pediatric obesity remains a public health burden and continues to increase in prevalence. The gut microbiota plays a causal role in obesity and is a promising therapeutic target. Specifically, the microbial production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) from the fermentation of otherwise indigestible dietary carbohydrates may protect against pediatric obesity and metabolic syndrome. Still, it has not been demonstrated that therapies involving microbiota-targeting carbohydrates, known as prebiotics, will enhance gut bacterial SCFA production in children and adolescents with obesity (age 10-18). Here, we used an in vitro system to examine the SCFA production by fecal microbiota from 17 children with obesity when exposed to five different commercially available over-the-counter (OTC) prebiotic supplements. We found microbiota from all 17 patients actively metabolized most prebiotics. Still, supplements varied in their acidogenic potential. Significant inter-donor variation also existed in SCFA production, which 16S rRNA sequencing supported as being associated with differences in the host microbiota composition. Last, we found that neither fecal SCFA concentration, microbiota SCFA production capacity, nor markers of obesity positively correlated with one another. Together, these in vitro findings suggest the hypothesis that OTC prebiotic supplements may be unequal in their ability to stimulate SCFA production in children and adolescents with obesity, and that the most acidogenic prebiotic may differ across individuals.\n\nIMPORTANCEPediatric obesity remains a major public health problem in the US, where 17% of children and adolescents are obese, and rates of pediatric  severe obesity are increasing. Children and adolescents with obesity face higher health risks, and non-invasive therapies for pediatric obesity often have limited success. The human gut microbiome has been implicated in adult obesity, and microbiota-directed therapies can aid weight loss in adults with obesity. However, less is known about the microbiome in pediatric obesity, and microbiota-directed therapies are understudied in children and adolescents. Our research has two important findings: 1) dietary prebiotics (fiber) cause the microbiota from adolescents with obesity to produce more SCFA, and 2) the effectiveness of each prebiotic is donor-dependent. Together, these findings suggest that prebiotic supplements could help children and adolescents with obesity, but that these therapies may not be one-size-fits-all.",

Scutellariae radix (Huangqin in Chinese), the root of Scutellaria baicalensis has been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat viral infection related symptoms. The extracts of S. baicalensis have exhibited broad spectrum antiviral activities. We studied the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of S. baicalensis and its ingredient compounds. We found that the ethanol extract of S. baicalensis inhibits SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro activity in vitro and the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells with an EC50 of 0.74 g/ml.

    "abstract": "In recent years, Setaria viridis has been developed as a model plant to better understand the C4 photosynthetic pathway in major crops. With the increasing availability of genomic resources for S. viridis research, highly efficient genome editing technologies are needed to create genetic variation resources for functional genomics. Here, we developed a protoplast assay to rapidly optimize the multiplexed CRISPR/Cas9 system in S. viridis. Targeted mutagenesis efficiency was further improved by an average of 1.4-fold with the exonuclease, Trex2. Distinctive mutation profiles were found in the Cas9_Trex2 samples with 94% of deletions larger than 10bp, and less than 1% of mutations being insertions. Further analyses indicated that 52.2% of deletions induced by Cas9_Trex2, as opposed to 3.5% by Cas9 alone, were repaired through microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) rather than the canonical NHEJ DNA repair pathway. Combined with the robust agrobacterium-mediated transformation method with more than 90% efficiency, the multiplex CRISPR/Cas9_Trex2 system was demonstrated to induce targeted mutations in two tightly linked genes, svDrm1a and svDrm1b, at the frequency ranging from 73% to 100% in T0 plants. These mutations were transmitted to at least 60% of the transgene-free T1 plants with 33% of them containing bi-allelic or homozygous mutations in both genes. This highly efficient multiplex CRISPR/Cas9_Trex2 system makes it possible to create a large mutant resource for S. viridis in a rapid and high throughput manner, and has the potential to be widely applicable in achieving more predictable MMEJ-mediated mutations in many plant species.",

    "abstract": "Since the beginning of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, a large number of relevant articles has been published or become available in preprint servers. These articles, along with earlier related literature, compose a valuable knowledge base affecting contemporary research studies, or even government actions to limit the spread of the disease and treatment decisions taken by physicians. However, the number of such articles is increasing at an intense rate making the exploration of the relevant literature and the identification of useful knowledge in it challenging. In this work, we describe BIP4COVID19, an open dataset compiled to facilitate the coronavirus-related literature exploration, by providing various indicators of scientific impact for the relevant articles. Additionally, we provide a publicly accessible Web interface on top of our data, allowing the exploration of the publications based on the computed indicators.",

    "abstract": "We have developed a novel detection system which couples CRISPR-Cas recognition of target sequences, Cas mediated nucleic acid probe cleavage, and quantum dots as highly sensitive reporter molecules for instrument-free detection of viral nucleic acid targets. After target recognition and Cas mediated cleavage of biotinylated ssDNA probe molecules, the probe molecules are bound to magnetic particles. A complimentary ssDNA oligonucleotide quantum dot conjugate is then added, which only hybridizes to un-cleaved probes on the magnetic beads. After separation of hybridized from unhybridized quantum dot conjugates by magnetic sequestration, the signal is measured fluorometrically to provide a signal proportional to the cleaved probes and therefore the amount of target nucleic acid. To demonstrate the power of this assay, a 250 bp DNA target sequence matching a portion of the African swine fever virus (ASFV) genome is used and a detection limit of ~0.5 nM is achieved without target amplification using a simple portable ultraviolet flashlight. The positive samples are readily confirmed by visual inspection, completely avoiding the need for complicated devices and instruments. This work establishes the feasibility of a simple, instrument free assay for rapid nucleic acid screening in both hospitals and point-of-care settings.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that can play critical roles in regulating various cellular processes including during many parasitic infections. Here, we report a regulatory role for miR-34c-3p in cAMP-independent regulation of PKA activity in Theileria annulata infection of bovine leukocytes. We identified prkar2b (cAMP-dependent protein kinase A type II-beta regulatory subunit), as a novel miR-34c-3p target gene and demonstrated how infection-induced up-regulation of miR-34c-3p in leukocytes repressed PRKAR2B expression to increase PKA activity and promote the virulent disseminating tumour phenotype of T. annulata-transformed macrophages. Finally, we demonstrate that miR-34c-3p regulation of prkar2b expression is generalizable, by confirming that Plasmodium falciparum infection of red blood cells also raises intracellular levels of miR-34c-3p and show that this negatively regulates host prkar2b expression so increasing PKA activity. Infection-induced increase in miR-34c-3p levels, therefore, represents a novel cAMP-independent way of regulating host cell PKA activity in infections by Theileria and Plasmodium parasites.\n\nAbstract ImportanceTheileria and Plasmodium infections of leukocytes and erythrocytes; respectively, lead to an increase in host cell miR-34c-3p levels and we identified prkar2b (cAMP-dependent protein kinase A type II-beta regulatory subunit), as a specific miR-34c-3p target gene. We demonstrate how infection-induced up-regulation of miR-34c-3p repressed PRKAR2B expression to increase PKA activity independent of fluxes in cAMP. Thus, in two different host-parasite combinations infection-induced increase in miR-34c-3p represents a novel epigenetic way of increasing in host PKA activity that contributes to the pathology of disease.",

    "abstract": "Necroptosis is a regulated and inflammatory form of cell death. We, and others, have previously reported that necroptotic cells release extracellular vesicles (EVs). We have found that necroptotic EVs are loaded with proteins, including the phosphorylated form of the key necroptosis-executing factor, mixed lineage kinase domain-like kinase (MLKL). However, neither the exact protein composition, nor the impact, of necroptotic EVs have been delineated. To characterize their content, EVs from necroptotic and untreated U937 cells were isolated and analyzed by mass spectrometry-based proteomics. A total of 3337 proteins were identified, sharing a high degree of similarity with exosome proteome databases, and clearly distinguishing necroptotic and control EVs. A total of 352 proteins were significantly upregulated in the necroptotic EVs. Among these were MLKL and caspase-8, as validated by immunoblot. Components of the ESCRTIII machinery and inflammatory signaling were also upregulated in the necroptotic EVs, as well as currently unreported components of vesicle formation and transport, and necroptotic signaling pathways. Moreover, we found that necroptotic EVs can be phagocytosed by macrophages to modulate cytokine and chemokine secretion. Finally, we uncovered that necroptotic EVs contain tumor neoantigens, and are enriched with components of antigen processing and presentation. In summary, our study reveals a new layer of regulation during the early stage of necroptosis, mediated by the secretion of specific EVs that influences the microenvironment and may instigate innate and adaptive immune responses. This study sheds light on new potential players in necroptotic signaling and its related EVs, and uncovers the functional tasks accomplished by the cargo of these necroptotic EVs.",

Up until March 27, 2020, we downloaded 53 illumina datasets, mostly from China, USA (Washington DC) and Australia (Victoria). Of 30 high quality datasets, 27 datasets (90%) contain at least a single founder mutation and most of the variants are missense (over 63%). Five-point mutations with clonal (founder) effect were found in USA sequencing samples. Sequencing samples from USA in GenBank present this signature with 50% allele frequencies among samples. Australian mutation signatures were more diverse than USA samples, but still, clonal events were found in those samples. Mutations in the helicase and orf1a coding regions from SARS-CoV-2 were predominant, among others, suggesting that these proteins are prone to evolve by natural selection. Finally, we firmly urge that primer sets for diagnosis be carefully designed, since rapidly occurring variants would affect the performance of the reverse transcribed quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) based viral testing.",

    "abstract": "During DNA replication, replicative DNA polymerases may encounter DNA lesions, which can stall replication forks. One way to prevent replication fork stalling is through the recruitment of specialized translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases that have evolved to incorporate nucleotides opposite DNA lesions. Rev1 is a specialized TLS polymerase that bypasses abasic sites as well as minor-groove and exocyclic guanine adducts. It does this by using a unique protein-template mechanism in which the template base is flipped out of the DNA helix and the incoming dCTP hydrogen bonds with an arginine side chain. To observe Rev1 catalysis at the atomic level, we employed time-lapse X-ray crystallography. We found that Rev1 flips out the template base prior to binding the incoming nucleotide. Binding the incoming nucleotide changes the conformation of the DNA substrate to orient it for nucleotidyl transfer, and this is not coupled to large structural changes in the protein like those observed with other DNA polymerases. Moreover, we found that following nucleotide incorporation, Rev1 converts the pyrophosphate product to two mono-phosphates, which drives the reaction in the forward direction. Following nucleotide incorporation, the hydrogen bonds between the incorporated nucleotide and the arginine side chain are broken, but the templating base remains extrahelical. These post-catalytic changes prevent potentially mutagenic processive synthesis by Rev1 and facilitate dissociation of the DNA product from the enzyme.",

Surface glycoprotein and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein are two important proteins of this virus facilitating its entry into host cell and genome replication. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a prospective tool of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway for the control of human viral infections by suppressing viral gene expression through hybridization and neutralization of target complementary mRNA. So, in this study, the power of RNA interference technology was harnessed to develop siRNA molecules against specific target genes namely, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein gene and surface glycoprotein gene. Conserved sequence from 139 SARS-CoV-2 strains from around the globe was collected to construct 78 siRNA that can inactivate nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and surface glycoprotein genes. Finally, based on GC content, free energy of folding, free energy of binding, melting temperature and efficacy prediction process 8 siRNA molecules were selected which are proposed to exerts the best action. These predicted siRNAs should effectively silence the genes of SARS-CoV-2 during siRNA mediated treatment assisting in the response against SARS-CoV-2",

Consequently, the genetic variations that underly the commonalities, differences and treatment options in SLE among ancestral groups have not been well elucidated. To address this, we undertook a genome-wide association study, increasing the sample size of Chinese populations to the level of existing European studies. Thirty-eight novel SLE-associated loci and incomplete sharing of genetic architecture were identified. Nine disease loci showed clear ancestral group heterogeneity and implicated antibody production as a potential mechanism for differences in disease manifestation. Polygenic risk scores performed significantly better when trained on matched ancestral data sets. These analyses help to reveal the genetic bases for disparities in SLE among ancestral groups.",

However, the causal relationship of these events remains unclear. The established dominance of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) function in the immune response suggests an obligate link between inflammation and the co-morbidities of obesity. To this end, we sought to determine how STAT1 activity in white adipocytes affects insulin sensitivity. STAT1 expression in WAT inversely correlated with fasting plasma glucose in both obese mice and humans. Metabolomic and gene expression profiling established STAT1 deletion in adipocytes (STAT1 fKO) enhanced mitochondrial function and accelerated TCA cycle flux coupled with subcutaneous WAT hyperplasia. STAT1 fKO reduced WAT inflammation, but insulin resistance persisted in obese mice. Rather, elimination of type I cytokine interferon gamma (IFN{gamma}) activity enhanced insulin sensitivity in diet-induced obesity. Our findings reveal a permissive mechanism that bridges WAT inflammation to whole-body insulin sensitivity.",

In a Mali cohort spanning infants to adults we conducted a longitudinal analysis of B cells specific for the Pf blood-stage antigens AMA1 and MSP1, as well as the comparator antigen influenza hemagglutinin (HA). At the uninfected baseline, before the malaria season, Pf-specific memory B cells (MBCs) in children are disproportionally IgM+ and only gradually shift to IgG+ with age, in contrast to HA-specific MBCs that are predominantly IgG+ from infancy to adulthood. In response to acute febrile malaria, Pf-specific IgM B cells increase in frequency and upregulate activation and co-stimulatory markers. B cell receptor (BCR) analysis showed that Pf-specific IgM B cells are somatically hypermutated at levels comparable to HA-specific IgG B cells. Finally, IgM antibodies from the plasma of malaria-exposed individuals were comparable to IgG in inhibiting Pf blood-stage growth in vitro, and significantly better at enhancing phagocytosis of Pf merozoites, suggesting that IgM may protect through both direct neutralization and opsonization. Thus, somatically hypermutated Pf-specific IgM MBCs dominate in early life, are activated and expand during acute malaria and are associated with plasma IgM that inhibits parasite growth in vitro.",

    "abstract": "Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is a histone H3 lysine 27 methyltransferases. Non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) in the ezh2 gene may cause Weaver Syndrome that is a prominent and rare congenital disorder. Several EZH2 genetic variants have been characterized and reported, but there is no information available on their structural dynamics. Our study employs an in silico approach for structural and functional characterization of EZH2 nsSNPs. We identified 19 EZH2 nsSNPs majorly associated with Weaver Syndrome, among which four SET-domain nsSNPs including V621M, A677T, R679C, and H689Y significantly affected EZH2 structure. We conducted the triplicate of 100 ns of molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) to compare the dynamic interaction behaviors between wild-type and mutants of EZH2 with their substrate, H3K27me0 peptide. The simulation results revealed that the mutants had higher levels of structural variations as evidenced by secondary structure, density, distance plots, and principal component analysis. Compared to EZH2-WT, the mutants A677T and H689Y have shown lower binding energy with H3K27me0 peptide due to the denaturing of 310 helixes as exemplified by MM/PBSA calculations and secondary structure analysis. Our analysis shed light on mechanisms of structural variations of EZH2 nsSNPs and lay a stone to develop mutant-based therapeutic strategies for the design of target-specific scaffolds against Weaver Syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Widely available low-cost electronics encourage the development of open-source tools for neuroscientific research. In recent years, many neuroscientists recognized the open science movement for its potential to stimulate and encourage science that is less focused on money, and more on robustness, validity, questioning and understanding. Here, we wanted to contribute to this global community by creating a research platform based on a common digital kitchen scale. This everyday ordinary kitchen tool is sometimes used in neuroscience research in various ways; however, its use is limited by sampling rate and inability to store and analyze data. To tackle this problem we developed a Platform for Auditory STArtle or PASTA. This robust and simple platform enables users to obtain data from kitchen scale load cells at a high sampling rate, store it and analyze it. Here, we used it to analyze acoustic startle and prepulse inhibition sensorimotor gating in rats treated intracerebroventricularly with streptozotocin, but the system can be easily modified and upgraded for other purposes. In accordance with open science principles, we shared complete hardware design with instructions. Furthermore, we also disclose our software codes written for PASTA data acquisition (C++, Arduino) and acoustic startle experimental protocol (Python) and analysis (R-based Awesome Toolbox for PASTA, ratPASTA R package). To further encourage the development of our PASTA platform we demonstrate its sensitivity by using PASTA-gathered data to extract breathing patterns during rat freezing behavior in our experimental protocol.",

    "abstract": "The association between reduced myofilament force-generating capacity (Fmax) and heart failure (HF) is clear, however the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show the Fmax decrease arises from impaired BAG3-mediated sarcomere turnover. Myofilament BAG3 decreased in human HF and predicted the extent of Fmax decrease. This relationship was confirmed using BAG3+/- mice, which had reduced Fmax and increased myofilament ubiquitination, suggesting impaired protein turnover. We show cardiac BAG3 operates via the chaperone-assisted selective autophagy complex (CASA), conserved from skeletal muscle, and confirm sarcomeric CASA localization is BAG3/proteotoxic stress-dependent. To determine if increasing BAG3 expression in HF would restore sarcomere proteostasis/Fmax, HF mice were treated with AAV9/BAG3. Gene therapy fully restored Fmax after four weeks and decreased ubiquitination. Using mass spectrometry, we identified several sarcomere proteins with increased ubiquitination in HF and four that decreased with AAV9/BAG3. Our findings indicate BAG3-mediated sarcomere turnover is required for myofilament functional maintenance.",

    "abstract": "Ion channels in excitable cells function in macromolecular complexes in which auxiliary proteins modulate the biophysical properties of the pore-forming subunits. Hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-sensitive HCN4 channels are critical determinants of membrane excitability in cells throughout the body, including thalamocortical neurons and cardiac pacemaker cells. We previously showed that the properties of HCN4 channels differ dramatically in different cell types, possibly due to the endogenous expression of auxiliary proteins. Here, we report the discovery of a family of endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane proteins that interact with and modulate HCN4. Lymphoid-restricted membrane protein (LRMP, Jaw1) and inositol trisphosphate receptor-associated guanylate kinase substrate (IRAG, Mrvi1, Jaw1L) are homologous proteins with small ER luminal domains and large cytoplasmic domains. Despite their homology, LRMP and IRAG have distinct effects on HCN4. LRMP is a loss-of-function modulator that inhibits the canonical depolarizing shift in the voltage-dependence of HCN4 activation in response to binding of cAMP. In contrast, IRAG causes a gain of HCN4 function by depolarizing the basal voltage-dependence of activation in the absence of cAMP. The mechanisms of action of LRMP and IRAG are novel; they are independent of trafficking and cAMP binding, and they are specific to the HCN4 isoform. We also found that IRAG is highly expressed in the mouse sinoatrial node where computer modeling predicts that its presence increases HCN4 availability. Our results suggest important roles for LRMP and IRAG in regulation of cellular excitability and as tools for advancing mechanistic understanding of HCN4 channel function.\n\nSignificance statementThe pore-forming subunits of ion channels are regulated by auxiliary interacting proteins. Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-sensitive isoform 4 (HCN4) channels are critical determinants of electrical excitability in many types of cells including neurons and cardiac pacemaker cells. Here we report the discovery of two novel HCN4 regulatory proteins. Despite their homology, the two proteins -- lymphoid-restricted membrane protein (LRMP) and inositol trisphosphate receptor-associated guanylate kinase substrate (IRAG) -- have opposing effects on HCN4, causing loss- and gain-of-function, respectively. LRMP and IRAG are expected to play critical roles in regulation of physiological processes ranging from wakefulness to heart rate through their modulation of HCN4 channel function.",

    "abstract": "How cell shape and mechanics are organized in three dimensions during tissue morphogenesis is poorly understood. In the Drosophila wing imaginal disc, we examined the mechanical processes that determine the shape of epithelial cells. Since it has been known that basement membrane influences the mechanics intracellularly, we reexamined the material properties of the basement membrane with fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy in its native environment. Further, we investigated the effect on cell shape and tissue mechanics when disruptions were instigated at three different time scales: (1) short (seconds with laser cutting), (2) medium (minutes with drug treatments), and (3) long (days with RNAi interference). We found regions in which the basement membrane is much thicker and heterogeneous than previously reported. Disrupting the actin cytoskeleton through drug treatment affects cell shape only at the apical surface, while the shapes in the medial and basal surfaces were not altered. In contrast, when integrin function was inhibited via RNAi or basement membrane integrity was disrupted by drug treatment, the medial and basal cell shapes were affected. We propose that basement membrane thickness patterns determine the height and basal surface area of cells and the curvature of folds in the wing disc. Based on these findings and previous studies, we propose a model of how cell shapes and tissue properties were determined by highly local, modular apical and basal mechanics.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=187 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/036152v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (38K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@177c8f0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1292624org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@871577org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@925bcd_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

However, the general mechanisms determining social structure remain unclear. Using data on 73,767 social interactions among wild spotted hyenas over 27 years, we show that a process of social inheritance determines how offspring relationships are formed and maintained. The relationships of offspring with other hyenas are similar to those of their mothers over up to six years, and the degree of similarity increases with maternal social rank. The strength of mother-offspring relationship affects social inheritance and is positively correlated with offspring longevity. These results confirm the hypothesis that social inheritance of relationships can structure animal social networks and be subject to adaptive tradeoffs.",

This new form of ECM can be infused after injury, specifically localize to injured tissues by coating the leaky microvasculature, and promote cell survival and tissue repair. In this study, we show the feasibility and targeting of intravascular ECM infusions using models of acute myocardial infarction (MI), traumatic brain injury, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Furthermore, safety and efficacy were demonstrated in small and large animal models of acute MI following intracoronary infusion, which included using a clinically-relevant catheter in the large animal model. Functional improvements, specifically reduced left ventricular volumes and improved wall motion scores were observed after ECM infusions post-MI. Genes related to tissue repair and inflammation were differential expressed in response to ECM infusions. This study shows proof-of-concept for a new paradigm of delivering pro-healing ECM biomaterials via intravascular infusion to heal tissue from the inside out.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a public-health emergency of international concern and thus calling for the development of safe and effective therapeutics and prophylactics particularly a vaccine to protect against the infection. SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is an attractive candidate for vaccine, antibodies and inhibitor development because of many roles it plays in attachment, fusion and entry into the host cell. In this study, we characterized the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein by immune-informatics techniques to put forward potential B and T cell epitopes, followed by the use of epitopes in construction of a multi-epitope peptide vaccine construct (MEPVC). The MEPVC revealed robust host immune system simulation with high production of immunoglobulins, cytokines and interleukins. Stable conformation of the MEPVC with a representative innate immune TLR3 receptor was observed involving strong hydrophobic and hydrophilic chemical interactions, along with enhanced contribution from salt-bridges towards inter-molecular stability. Molecular dynamics simulation in solution aided further in interpreting strong affinity of the MEPVC for TLR3. This stability is the attribute of several vital residues from both TLR3 and MEPVC as shown by radial distribution function (RDF) and a novel analytical tool axial frequency distribution (AFD). Comprehensive binding free energies estimation was provided at the end that concluded major domination by electrostatic and minor from van der Waals. Summing all, the designed MEPVC has tremendous potential of providing protective immunity against COVID-19 and thus has the potential to be considered in experimental studies.",

We previously reported that inhibition of oncogenic Ras/MEK increases PpIX accumulation in cancer cells by reducing PpIX efflux through ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1 (ABCB1) as well as PpIX conversion to heme by ferrochelatase (FECH). Here, we sought to identify the downstream pathways of Ras/MEK involved in the regulation of PpIX accumulation via ABCB1 and FECH. First, we demonstrated that Ras/MEK activation reduced PpIX accumulation in RasV12-transformed NIH3T3 cells and HRAS transgenic mice. Knockdown of p90 ribosomal S6 kinases (RSK) 2, 3, or 4 increased PpIX accumulation in the RasV12-transformed NIH3T3 cells. Further, treatment with an RSK inhibitor reduced ABCB1 expression and increased PpIX accumulation. Moreover, HIF-1 expression was reduced when the RasV12-transformed NIH3T3 cells were treated with a MEK inhibitor, demonstrating that HIF-1 is a downstream element of MEK. HIF-1 inhibition decreased the activity of FECH and increased PpIX accumulation. Finally, we demonstrated the involvement of RSKs and HIF-1 in the regulation of PpIX accumulation in human cancer cell lines (DLD-1, SNB-75, Hs 578T, and MDA MB 231). These results demonstrate that the RSK-ABCB1 and HIF-1-FECH axes are the downstream pathways of Ras/MEK involved in the regulation of PpIX accumulation.",

    "abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO) is a free radical gaseous messenger with a broad distribution across the animal kingdom. However, the early evolution of nitric oxide-mediated signaling in animals is unclear due to limited information about prebilaterian metazoans such as placozoans. Here, we analyzed NO synthases (NOS) in four different species of placozoans (haplotypes H1, H2, H4, H13). In contrast to all other invertebrates studied, Hoilungia and Trichoplax have three distinct NOS genes, including PDZ domain-containing NOS. To characterize NOS activity in Trichoplax adhaerens, we used capillary electrophoresis for microchemical assays of NO-related metabolites. Specifically, we quantified nitrites (products of NO oxidation) and L-citrulline (co-product of NO synthesis from L-arginine), which were affected by NOS inhibitors confirming the presence of functional NOS. Next, using fluorescent single-molecule in situ hybridization, we showed that distinct NOSs are expressed in different subpopulations of cells, with a noticeable distribution close to the edge regions of Trichoplax. These data suggest the compartmentalized release of this messenger and a greater diversity of cell types in placozoans than anticipated. We also revealed a dramatic diversification of NO receptor machinery, including identification of both canonical and novel NIT-domain containing soluble guanylate cyclases as putative NO/nitrite/nitrate sensors. Thus, although Trichoplax is considered to be one of the morphologically simplest free-living animals, the complexity of NO-cGMP-mediated signaling is greater to those in vertebrates. This situation illuminates multiple lineage-specific diversifications of NOSs and NO/nitrite/nitrate sensors from the common ancestor of Metazoa.\n\nShort AbstractNitric oxide (NO) is a ubiquitous gaseous messenger, but we know little about its early evolution.

    "abstract": "Anti-apoptotic MCL1 is one of the most frequently amplified genes in human cancers and elevated expression confers resistance to many therapeutics including the BH3-mimetic agents ABT-199 and ABT-263. The anti-malarial, dihydroartemisinin (DHA) translationally represses MCL-1 and synergizes with BH3-mimetics. To explore how DHA represses MCL-1, a genome-wide CRISPR screen identified that loss of genes in the heme synthesis pathway renders mouse BCR-ABL+ B-ALL cells resistant to DHA-induced death. Mechanistically, DHA disrupts the interaction between heme and the eIF2 kinase heme regulated inhibitor (HRI) triggering the integrated stress response. Genetic ablation of Eif2ak1, which encodes HRI, blocks MCL-1 repression in response to DHA treatment and represses the synergistic killing of DHA and BH3-mimetics compared to wild-type leukemia. Furthermore, BTdCPU, a small-molecule activator of HRI, similarly triggers MCL-1 repression and synergizes with BH3-mimetics in mouse and human leukemia including both Ph+ and Ph-like B-ALL. Lastly, combinatorial treatment of leukemia bearing mice with both BTdCPU and a BH3-mimetic extended survival and repressed MCL-1 in vivo. These findings reveal for the first time that the HRI-dependent cellular heme-sensing pathway can modulate apoptosis in leukemic cells by repressing MCL-1 and increasing their responsiveness to BH3-mimetics. This signaling pathway could represent a generalizable mechanism for repressing MCL-1 expression in malignant cells and sensitizing them to available therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Nitrogenase is the main source of natural fixed nitrogen for the biosphere. Two forms of this metalloenzyme, the vanadium (V) and iron (Fe)-only nitrogenases, were recently found to reduce small amounts of carbon dioxide into the potent greenhouse gas methane. Here we report carbon and hydrogen stable isotopic compositions and fractionations of methane generated by V- and Fe-only nitrogenases in the metabolically versatile nitrogen fixer Rhodopseudomonas palustris. The stable carbon isotope fractionation imparted by both forms of alternative nitrogenase are within the range observed for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (13CO2/CH4 = 1.051 {+/-} 0.002 for V-nitrogenase and 1.055 {+/-} 0.001 for Fe-only nitrogenase, mean {+/-} SE). In contrast, the hydrogen isotope fractionations (2H2O/CH4 = 2.071 {+/-} 0.014 for V-nitrogenase and 2.078 {+/-} 0.018 for Fe-only nitrogenase) are the largest of any known biogenic or geogenic pathway. The large 2H2O/CH4 shows that the reaction pathway nitrogenases use to form methane strongly discriminates against 2H, and that 2H2O/CH4 distinguishes nitrogenase-derived methane from all other known biotic and abiotic sources. These findings on nitrogenase-derived methane will help constrain carbon and nitrogen flows in microbial communities and the role of the alternative nitrogenases in global biogeochemical cycles.\n\nImportanceAll forms of life require nitrogen for growth. Many different kinds of microbes living in diverse environments make inert nitrogen gas from the atmosphere bioavailable using a special protein, nitrogenase. Nitrogenase has a wide substrate range, and in addition to producing bioavailable nitrogen, some forms of nitrogenase also produce small amounts of the greenhouse gas methane. This is different from other microbes that produce methane to generate energy. Until now, there was no good way to determine when microbes with nitrogenases are making methane in nature. Here, we developed an isotopic fingerprint that allows scientists to distinguish methane from microbes making it for energy versus those making it as a byproduct of nitrogen acquisition. With this new fingerprint, it will be possible to improve our understanding of the relationship between methane production and nitrogen acquisition in nature.",

    "abstract": "Adipose tissue engineering holds promise to address the unmet need in plastic and reconstructive surgery for strategies that promote the stable and predictable regeneration of adipose tissue for volume augmentation applications. Previous studies have demonstrated that decellularized adipose tissue (DAT) scaffolds can provide a pro-adipogenic microenvironment, and that seeding with adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) can enhance in vivo angiogenesis and adipogenesis within DAT implants. Recognizing that bioreactor systems can promote cell expansion and infiltration on tissue-engineered scaffolds, this study evaluated the effects of culturing human ASCs on DAT scaffolds within a perfusion bioreactor. Using this system, the impact of both shear stress stimulation and hypoxic preconditioning were explored in vitro and in vivo. Initial studies compared the effects of 14 days of culture within the perfusion bioreactor under 2% O2 or ~20% O2 on human ASC expansion and hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1) expression in vitro relative to static cultured controls. The findings indicated that culturing within the bioreactor under 2% O2 significantly increased ASC proliferation on the DAT, with a higher cell density observed in the scaffold periphery. HIF-1 expression was significantly higher when the scaffolds were cultured under 2% O2. Subsequent characterization in a subcutaneous implant model in athymic nude mice revealed that in vivo angiogenesis and adipogenesis were markedly enhanced when the ASCs were cultured on the DAT within the perfusion bioreactor under 2% O2 for 14 days prior to implantation relative to the other culture conditions, as well as additional freshly-seeded and unseeded DAT control groups. Overall, dynamic culture within the perfusion bioreactor system under hypoxia represents a promising approach for preconditioning ASCs on DAT scaffolds to enhance their capacity to stimulate blood vessel formation and infiltration, as well as host-derived adipose tissue regeneration.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA diverse and abundant gut microbiome can improve cancer patients treatment response; however, the effect of pelvic chemoradiotherapy (CRT) on gut diversity and composition is unclear. The purpose of this prospective study was to identify changes in the diversity and composition of the gut microbiome during and after pelvic CRT.\n\nMaterials and MethodsRectal swabs from 58 women with cervical, vaginal, or vulvar cancer from two institutions were prospectively analyzed before CRT (baseline), during CRT (weeks 1, 3, and 5), and at first follow-up (week 12) using 16Sv4 rRNA gene sequencing of the V4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S rRNA marker gene. Observed operational taxonomic units (OTUs; representative of richness) and Shannon, Simpson, Inverse Simpson, and Fisher diversity indices were used to characterize alpha (within-sample) diversity. Changes over time were assessed using a paired t-test, repeated measures ANOVA, and linear mixed modeling. Compositional changes in specific bacteria over time were evaluated using linear discriminant analysis effect size.\n\nResultsGut microbiome richness and diversity levels continually decreased throughout CRT (mean Shannon diversity index, 2.52 vs. 2.91; all P <0.01), but were at or near baseline levels in 60% of patients by week 12. Patients with higher gut diversity at baseline had the steepest decline in gut microbiome diversity. Gut microbiome composition was significantly altered during CRT, with increases in Proteobacteria and decreases in Clostridiales, but adapted after CRT, with increases in Bacteroides species.\n\nConclusionAfter CRT, the gut microbiomes diversity tends to return to baseline levels, but its structure and composition remain significantly altered. These changes should be considered when designing studies to analyze the gut microbiome as a predictive or prognostic biomarker in patients who receive pelvic CRT for gynecologic cancers.",

    "abstract": "Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) display remarkable color pattern diversity including sexual dimorphism and intrasexual polymorphism. We previously found that expression of a sex-determining transcription factor, the doublesex (dsx) gene, is associated with female color polymorphism (gynomorph for female-specific color and andromorph for male mimicking color) in the blue-tailed damselfly, Ischnura senegalensis. Here we investigate the function of dsx gene on thoracic coloration by electroporation-mediated RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi of the dsx common region changed color patterns of males and andromorphic females to patterns of gynomorphic females. Further, gynomorphic color pattern was not affected by dsx RNAi. The long isoform of dsx RNAi produced no effects, suggesting that the short isoform of dsx is important for body color masculinization in both males and andromorphic females. Expression pattern changes were also examined in five genes with different expression levels between sexes and female morphs. Among these genes are two melanin suppressing genes, black and ebony, that were upregulated in the dsx-RNAi region compared to a control region. Upregulation coincides with a gynomorphic orange color instead of the black stripe observed in males and andromorphic females. dsx may regulate male color differentiation by suppressing black and ebony in the thoracic region of I. senegalensis. Results add to the understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of female polymorphism in Odonata.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 30% of patients who have a Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) will suffer at least one incident of reinfection. While the underlying causes of CDI recurrence are poorly understood, interactions between C. difficile and other commensal gut bacteria are thought to play an important role. In this study, an in silico metagenomics pipeline was used to process taxa abundance data from 225 CDI patient stool samples into sample-specific models of bacterial community metabolism. The predicted metabolite production capabilities of each community were shown to provide improved recurrence prediction compared to direct use of taxa abundance data. More specifically, clustered metabolite synthesis rates generated from post-diagnosis samples produced a high Enterobacteriaceae cluster with disproportionate numbers of recurrent samples and patients. This cluster was predicted to have significantly reduced capabilities for secondary bile acid synthesis but elevated capabilities for aromatic amino acid catabolism. When applied to 40 samples from fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) patients and their donors, community modeling generated a high Enterobacteriaceae cluster with a disproportionate number of pre-FMT samples. This cluster also was predicted to exhibit reduced secondary bile acid synthesis and elevated aromatic amino acid catabolism. Because clustering of CDI and FMT samples did not identify statistical differences in C. difficile abundances, these model predictions support the hypothesis that Enterobacteriaceae may create a gut environment favorable for C. difficile spore germination and toxin synthesis.\n\nImportanceClostridioides difficile is an opportunistic human pathogen responsible for acute and sometimes chronic infections of the colon. Elderly individuals who are immunocompromised, frequently hospitalized and recipients of antibiotics are particular susceptible to infection. Approximately 30% of treated patients will suffer at least one episode of reinfection, commonly termed recurrence. The objective of the current study was to utilize computational metabolic modeling to investigate the hypothesis that recurrent infections are related to the composition of the gut bacterial community within each patient. Our model predictions suggest that patients who have high compositions of the bacterial family Enterobacteriaceae during antibiotic treatment are more likely to develop recurrent infections due to a metabolically-disrupted gut environment. Successful treatment of recurrent patients with transplanted fecal matter is predicted to correct this metabolic disruption, suggesting that interactions between C. difficile and Enterobacteriaceae are worthy of additional study.",

    "abstract": "The host protein SERINC5 inhibits the infectivity of HIV-1 virions in an Env-dependent manner and is counteracted by Nef. The conformation of the Env trimer reportedly correlates with sensitivity to SERINC5. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the \"open\" conformation of the Env trimer revealed by sensitivity to the V3-loop specific antibody 447-52D directly correlates with sensitivity to SERINC5. Of five Envs tested, SF162 was the most sensitive to neutralization by 447-52D, but it was not the most sensitive to SERINC5; instead the Env of LAI was substantially more sensitive to SERINC5 than all the other Envs. Mutational opening of the trimer by substitution of two tyrosines that mediate interaction between the V2 and V3 loops sensitized the Envs of JRFL and LAI to 447-52D as previously reported, but only BaL was sensitized to SERINC5. These data suggest that trimer \"openness\" is not sufficient for sensitivity to SERINC5.",
