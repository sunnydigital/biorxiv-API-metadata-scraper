    "abstract": "Intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) is a mechanism of therapeutic resistance and therefore an important clinical challenge. However, the extent, origin and drivers of ITH across cancer types are poorly understood. To address this question, we extensively characterize ITH across whole-genome sequences of 2,658 cancer samples, spanning 38 cancer types. Nearly all informative samples (95.1%) contain evidence of distinct subclonal expansions, with frequent branching relationships between subclones. We observe positive selection of subclonal driver mutations across most cancer types, and identify cancer type specific subclonal patterns of driver gene mutations, fusions, structural variants and copy-number alterations, as well as dynamic changes in mutational processes between subclonal expansions. Our results underline the importance of ITH and its drivers in tumor evolution, and provide an unprecedented pan-cancer resource of comprehensively annotated subclonal events from whole-genome sequencing data.",

    "abstract": "AimsVancomycin, an antibiotic, is used to treat infection of multi-drug resistant strains of Clostridium difficile and Staphylococcus. Post-usage effects of vancomycin may lead to many unwanted effects including perturbation of gut microbiota. Perturbation of the gut microbiota, by Vancomycin, was used to understand the altered metabolic and innate immune profile of C57BL/6(Th1-biased) and BALB/c (Th2-biased) mice.\n\nMethods and ResultsFollowing treatment with vancomycin till day 4, we observed reduction in abundance of phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroides and increase in Proteobacteria in the gut for both strains of mice. Results further revealed a significant increase in the phylum Verrucomicrobia, from day 5 onwards following treatment with vancomycin led to decreased inflammation and increased rate of glucose tolerance in the host.\n\nConclusionsContinued dosage of vancomycin was more beneficial in C57BL/6 than BALB/c mice\n\nSignificance and Impact of the studyThe current study established that initial doses of vancomycin increased pathogenic bacteria but the continued doses of vancomycin provided significant health-related benefits to the host by decreasing pathogenic load and by increasing beneficial microbes of Verrucomicrobia phylum (A. muciniphila) more in C57BL/6 (Th-1) than BALB/c (Th-2) mice.",

    "abstract": "Real life choices often require that we draw inferences about the value of options based on structured, schematic knowledge about their utility for our current goals. Other times, value information may be retrieved directly from a specific prior experience with an option. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment, we investigated the neural systems involved in retrieving and assessing information from different memory sources to support value-based choice. Participants completed a task in which items could be conferred positive or negative value based on schematic associations (i.e. schema value), or learned directly from experience via deterministic feedback (i.e. experienced value). We found that ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activity correlated with the influence of both experience- and schema-based values on participants decisions. Connectivity between vmPFC and middle temporal cortex also tracked the inferred value of items based on schematic associations on the first presentation of ingredients, prior to any feedback. In contrast, the striatum responded to participants willingness to bet on ingredients as a function of the unsigned strength of their memory for those options values. These results argue that striatum and vmPFC play distinct roles in memory-based value judgment and decision-making. Specifically, the vmPFC assesses the value of options based on information inferred from schematic knowledge and retrieved from prior direct experience, while the striatum controls a decision to act on options based on memory strength.",

    "abstract": "Habenula neurons are constantly active. The level of activity affects mood and behaviour, with increased activity in the lateral habenula reflecting exposure to punishment and a switch to passive coping and depression. Here, we identify GABAergic neurons that could reduce activity in the lateral habenula of larval zebrafish. GAD65/67 immunohistochemistry and imaging of gad1b:DsRed transgenic fish suggest the presence of GABAergic terminals in the neuropil and between cell bodies in the lateral habenula. Retrograde tracing with the lipophilic dye DiD suggests that the former derives from the thalamus, while the latter originates from a group of cells in the posterior hypothalamus that are located between the posterior tuberal nucleus and hypothalamic lobes. Two-photon calcium imaging indicates that blue light causes excitation of thalamic GABAergic neurons and terminals in the neuropil, while a subpopulation of lateral habenula neurons show reduced intracellular calcium levels. Whole-cell electrophysiological recording indicates that blue-light reduces membrane potential of lateral habenula neurons. These observations suggest that GABAergic input from the thalamus may mediate inhibition in the zebrafish lateral habenula. Mechanisms governing release of GABA from the neurons in the posterior hypothalamus, which are likely to be in the tuberomammillary nucleus, remain to be defined.",

    "abstract": "The transcription regulatory network underlying essential and complex functionalities inside a eukaryotic cell is defined by the combinatorial actions of transcription factors (TFs). However, TF binding studies in plants are too few in number to produce a general picture of this complex regulatory netowrk. Here, we used ChIP-seq to determine the binding profiles of 104 TF expressed in the maize leaf. With this large dataset, we could reconstruct a transcription regulatory network that covers over 77% of the expressed genes, and reveal its scale-free topology and functional modularity like a real-world network. We found that TF binding occurs in clusters covering [~]2% of the genome, and shows enrichment for sequence variations associated with eQTLs and GWAS hits of complex agronomic traits. Machine-learning analyses were used to identify TF sequence preferences, and showed that co-binding is key for TF specificity. The trained models were used to predict and compare the regulatory networks in other species and showed that the core network is evolutionarily conserved. This study provided an extensive description of the architecture, organizing principle and evolution of the transcription regulatory network inside the plant leaf.",

    "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) primarily reside in the bone marrow, where they receive external cues from their local microenvironment. The complex milieu of biophysical cues, cellular components, and cell-secreted factors regulates the process by which HSC produce the blood and immune system. We previously showed direct co-culture of primary murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells with a population of marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal and progenitor cells (MSPCs) in a methacrylamide-functionalized gelatin (GelMA) hydrogel improves hematopoietic progenitor maintenance. However, the mechanism by which MSPCs influenced HSC fate decisions remained unknown. Herein, we report the use of proteomic analysis to correlate HSC phenotype to a broad candidate pool of 200 soluble factors produced by combined mesenchymal and hematopoietic progeny. Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), along with an iterative filter method, identified TGF{beta}-1, MMP-3, c-RP, and TROY as positively correlated with HSC maintenance. Experimentally, we then observe exogenous stimulation of HSC monocultures in GelMA hydrogels with these combined cytokines increases the ratio of hematopoietic progenitors to committed progeny after a 7-day culture 7.52 {+/-} 3.65 fold compared to non-stimulated monocultures. Findings suggest a cocktail of the downselected cytokines amplify hematopoietic maintenance potential of HSCs beyond that of MSPC-secreted factors alone. This work integrates empirical and computation methods to identify cytokine combinations to improve HSC maintenance within an engineered HSC niche, suggesting a route towards identifying feeder-free culture platforms for HSC expansion.\n\nInsightHematopoietic stem cells within an artificial niche receive maintenance cues in the form of soluble factors from hematopoietic and mesenchymal progeny. Applying a proteomic regression analysis, we identify a reduced set of soluble factors correlated to maintenance of a hematopoietic phenotype during culture in a biomaterial model of the bone marrow niche. We identify a minimum factor cocktail that promotes hematopoietic maintenance potential in a gelatin-based culture, regardless of the presence of mesenchymal feeder-cells. By combining empirical and computational methods, we report an experimentally feasible number of factors from a large dataset, enabling exogenous integration of soluble factors into an engineered hematopoietic stem cell for enhance maintenance potential of a quiescent stem cell population.",

    "abstract": "Specific elements of viral genomes regulate interactions within host cells. Here, we calculated the secondary structure content of >2000 coronaviruses and computed >100000 human protein interactions with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The genomic regions display different degrees of conservation. SARS-CoV-2 domain encompassing nucleotides 22500 - 23000 is conserved both at the sequence and structural level. The regions upstream and downstream, however, vary significantly. This part codes for the Spike S protein that interacts with the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Thus, variability of Spike S may be connected to different levels of viral entry in human cells within the population.\n\nOur predictions indicate that the 5 end of SARS-CoV-2 is highly structured and interacts with several human proteins. The binding proteins are involved in viral RNA processing such as double-stranded RNA specific editases and ATP-dependent RNA-helicases and have strong propensity to form stress granules and phase-separated complexes. We propose that these proteins, also implicated in viral infections such as HIV, are selectively recruited by SARS-CoV-2 genome to alter transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of host cells and to promote viral replication.",

    "abstract": "The deubiquitylating enzyme USP18 is a major negative regulator of the interferon (IFN) signalling cascade. IFN pathways contribute to resistance to conventional chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy and are often deregulated in cancer. USP18 is the predominant human protease that cleaves interferon-stimulated gene ISG15, a ubiquitin-like protein tightly regulated in the context of innate immunity, from its modified substrate proteins in vivo. In this study, using advanced proteomic techniques, we have expanded the USP18-dependent ISGylome and proteome in a chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML)-derived cell line (HAP1) treated with type I IFN. Novel ISGylation targets were characterised that modulate the sensing of innate ligands, antigen presentation and secretion of cytokines. Consequently, CML USP18-deficient cells are more antigenic, driving increased activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and are more susceptible to irradiation. Our results suggest USP18 as a pharmacological target in cancer immunotherapy and radiotherapy.",

    "abstract": "The plant immune system is fundamental to plant survival in natural ecosystems and productivity in crop fields. Substantial evidence supports the prevailing notion that plants possess a two-tiered innate immune system, called pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI). PTI is triggered by microbial patterns via cell surface-localized pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), whereas ETI is activated by pathogen effector proteins via mostly intracellularly-localized receptors called nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat proteins (NLRs)1-4. PTI and ETI are initiated by dist 30 inct activation mechanisms and are considered to act independently and have evolved sequentially5,6. Here we show that, contrary to the perception of PTI and ETI being separate immune signaling pathways, Arabidopsis PRR/co-receptor mutants, fls2/efr/cerk1 and bak1/bkk1/cerk1 triple mutants, are greatly impaired in ETI responses when challenged with incompatible Pseudomonas syrinage bacteria. We further show that the NADPH oxidase (RBOHD)-mediated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a critical early signaling event connecting PRR and NLR cascades and that PRR-mediated phosphorylation of RBOHD is necessary for full activation of RBOHD during ETI. Furthermore, NLR signaling rapidly augments the transcript and protein levels of key PTI components at an early stage and in a salicylic acid-independent manner. Our study supports an alternative model in which PTI is in fact an indispensable component of ETI during bacterial infection, implying that ETI halts pathogen infection, in part, by directly co-opting the anti-pathogen mechanisms proposed for PTI. This alternative model conceptually unites two major immune signaling pathways in the plant kingdom and mechanistically explains the long-observed similarities in downstream defense outputs between PTI and ETI.",

Here, we tested the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in a rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nMethodsTo evaluate the effect of remdesivir treatment on SARS-CoV-2 disease outcome, we used the recently established rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection that results in transient lower respiratory tract disease. Two groups of six rhesus macaques were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and treated with intravenous remdesivir or an equal volume of vehicle solution once daily. Clinical, virological and histological parameters were assessed regularly during the study and at necropsy to determine treatment efficacy.\n\nResultsIn contrast to vehicle-treated animals, animals treated with remdesivir did not show signs of respiratory disease and had reduced pulmonary infiltrates on radiographs. Virus titers in bronchoalveolar lavages were significantly reduced as early as 12hrs after the first treatment was administered. At necropsy on day 7 after inoculation, lung viral loads of remdesivir-treated animals were significantly lower and there was a clear reduction in damage to the lung tissue.\n\nConclusionsTherapeutic remdesivir treatment initiated early during infection has a clear clinical benefit in SARS-CoV-2-infected rhesus macaques.

    "abstract": "G3BP1 (Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1) is widely recognized as a core component of stress granules (SG), non-membranous RNA-protein-assemblies required for cellular survival under stress. We report that in the absence of SG, G3BP1 acts as lysosomal anchor of the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) protein complex. By tethering the TSC complex to lysosomes, G3BP1 suppresses signaling through the metabolic master regulator mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1). Like the known TSC complex subunits, G3BP1 suppresses phenotypes related to mTORC1 hyperactivity in the context of tumors and neuronal dysfunction. Thus, G3BP1 is not only a core component of SG but also a key element of lysosomal TSC-mTORC1 signaling.\n\nHighlightsThe bona fide stress granule component G3BP1 O_LIis a key element of the TSC-mTORC1 signaling axis.\nC_LIO_LItethers the TSC complex to lysosomes.\nC_LIO_LIprevents mTORC1 hyperactivation by metabolic stimuli.\nC_LIO_LIsuppresses mTORC1-driven cancer cell motility and epileptiform activity.\nC_LI\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/044081v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@77cb4forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c4d1a0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19e83acorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d6a378_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Background Leading to a sustained epidemic spread with &gt;40,000 confirmed human infections, including &gt;10,000 deaths, COVID-19 was caused by 2019-nCov and resulted in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis, which brought more challenges to the patient\u2019s treatment. The S-glycoprotein, which recognized as the key factor for the entry of 2019-nCov into the cell, contains two functional domains: an ACE2 receptor binding domain and a second domain necessary for fusion of the coronavirus and cell membranes. FURIN activity, exposes the binding and fusion domains, is essential for the zoonotic transmission of 2019-nCov. Moreover, it has been reported that ACE2 is likely to be the receptor for 2019-nCoV. In addition, FURIN enzyme and ACE2 receptor were expressed in airway epithelia, cardiac tissue, and enteric canals, which considered as the potential target organ of the virus. However, report about the expression of FURIN and ACE2 in oral tissues was limited.Methods In order to investigate the potential infective channel of new coronavirus in oral cavity, we analyze the expression of ACE2 and FURIN that mediate the new coronavirus entry into host cells in oral mucosa using the public single-cell sequence datasets. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining experiment was performed to confirm the expression of ACE2 and FURIN in the protein level.Results The bioinformatics results indicated the differential expression of ACE2 and FURIN on epithelial cells of different oral mucosal tissues and the proportion of FURIN-positive cells was obviously higher than that of ACE2-positive cells. IHC experiments revealed that both the ACE2-positive and FURIN-positive cells in the target tissues were mainly positioned in the epithelial layers, partly expressed in fibroblasts, which further confirm the bioinformatics results.Conclusions Based on these findings, we speculated that 2019-nCov could effectively invade oral mucosal cells though two possible routes: binding to the ACE2 receptor and fusion with cell membrane activated by FURIN protease. Our results indicated that oral mucosa tissues are susceptible to 2019-nCov, which provides valuable information for virus-prevention strategy in clinical care as well as daily life.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Although medicinal plants have played an important role in the development of therapeutics as natural compound sources, the synergistic effects of the multiple chemicals in the plants on multiple targets have not been studied widely. Recently, network-based methods for the analysis of drug-target interactions have gained attention and relies on the paradigm that a single drug can act on multiple targets rather than a single target. In this study, we have presented a novel approach to analyze the interactions between the chemicals in the medicinal plants and multiple targets based on the complex multipartite network of the medicinal plants, multi-chemicals, and multiple targets. The multipartite network was constructed via the conjunction of two relationships: chemicals in plants and the biological actions of those chemicals on the targets. By analyzing the structural characteristics of the network using the network analysis techniques, we investigated the similarities among the plants via their chemical profiles obtained from the hierarchical clustering analysis. In doing so, we introduced an index of the efficacy of chemicals in a plant on a protein target of interest, called target potency score (TPS). We showed that the analysis can identify specific chemical profiles from each group of plants, which can then be employed for discovering new alternative therapeutic agents. Furthermore, specific clusters of plants and chemicals acting on specific targets were retrieved using TPS that suggested potential drug candidates with high probability of clinical success. We expect that this approach may open a way to predict the biological functions of multi-chemicals and multi-plants on the targets of interest and enable repositioning of the plants and chemicals.",

    "abstract": "The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused thousands of deaths worldwide, including >18,000 in New York City (NYC) alone. The sudden emergence of this pandemic has highlighted a pressing clinical need for rapid, scalable diagnostics that can detect infection, interrogate strain evolution, and identify novel patient biomarkers. To address these challenges, we designed a fast (30-minute) colorimetric test (LAMP) for SARS-CoV-2 infection from naso/oropharyngeal swabs, plus a large-scale shotgun metatranscriptomics platform (total-RNA-seq) for host, bacterial, and viral profiling. We applied both technologies across 857 SARS-CoV-2 clinical specimens and 86 NYC subway samples, providing a broad molecular portrait of the COVID-19 NYC outbreak. Our results define new features of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, nominate a novel, NYC-enriched viral subclade, reveal specific host responses in interferon, ACE, hematological, and olfaction pathways, and examine risks associated with use of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. Together, these findings have immediate applications to SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, public health, and new therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Multidrug-resistant Vibrio parahaemolyticus has become a significant threat to human health as well as aquaculture, prioritizing the development of effective drug and vaccine candidates. Hence, the study was designed to identify novel therapeutics using a comprehensive genome-based analysis of V. parahaemolyticus. From V. parahaemolyticus proteome, a total of 4822 proteins were investigated in order to find out effective drug and vaccine targets. A range of diverse subtractive proteomics approaches - namely, identification of human non-homologous and pathogen-specific essential proteins, druggability and  anti-target analysis, prediction of subcellular localization, human microbiome non-homology screening, analysis of virulence factors, protein-protein interactions studies. Among 16 novel cytoplasmic proteins,  VIBPA Type II secretion system protein L and  VIBPA Putative fimbrial protein Z were allowed to molecular docking with 350 human metabolites, which revealed that Eliglustat, Simvastatin and Hydroxocobalamin were the top drug molecules considering free binding energy. On the contrary,  Sensor histidine protein kinase UhpB and  Flagellar hook-associated protein of 25 novel membrane proteins were subjected to T and B cell epitope prediction, antigenicity testing, transmembrane topology screening, allergenicity and toxicity assessment, population coverage analysis and molecular docking were adopted to generate the most immunogenic epitopes. Three subunit vaccines were constructed by the combination of highly antigenic epitopes along with suitable adjuvant, PADRE sequence and linkers. The designed vaccine constructs (V1, V2, V3) were analyzed by their physiochemical properties and molecular docking with MHC molecules that suggested the superiority of construct V1. Besides, the binding affinity of human TLR1/2 heterodimer and construct V1 was also biologically significant. The vaccine-receptor complex exhibited deformability at a minimum level that also strengthened our prediction. The optimized codons of the designed construct was cloned into pET28a(+) vector of E. coli strain K12. However, the predicted drug molecules and vaccine constructs could be further studied to combat V. parahaemolyticus associated infections.",

    "abstract": "Evolution couples differences in ambient pH to biological function through protonatable groups, in particular those that switch from buried to exposed and alter protonation state in doing so. We present a tool focusing on structure-based discovery and display of these groups. Since prediction of buried group pKas is computationally intensive, solvent accessibility of ionisable groups is displayed, from which the user can iteratively select pKa calculation centers. Results are color-coded, with emphasis on buried groups. Utility is demonstrated with coronaviruses, which exhibit variable dependence on the acidic pH of the endocytotic pathway. After benchmarking with variants of murine hepatitis virus, a pair of conserved histidine residues are identified that are predicted to be electrostatically frustrated at acidic pH in a common structural core of pre- and post-fusion coronavirus spike proteins. We suggest that an intermediate expanded conformation at endosomal pH could relax the frustration, allowing histidine protonation, and facilitating conformational conversion.

    "abstract": "Gut microbiota and the immune system are in constant exchange, which shapes both, host immunity and microbial communities. Here, improper immune regulation can cause inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colitis. Antibody therapies blocking signaling through the CD40 - CD40L axis showed promising results as these molecules have been described to be deregulated in certain IBD patients. To better understand the mechanism, we used transgenic DC-LMP1/CD40 animals, which lack intestinal CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs) and therefore cannot induce regulatory T (iTreg) cells due to a constitutive CD40-signal in CD11c+ cells. These mice rapidly develop spontaneous fatal colitis with an increase of inflammatory IL-17+IFN-{gamma}+ Th17/Th1 and IFN-{gamma}+ Th1 cells. In the present study we analyzed the impact of the microbiota on disease development and detected elevated IgA- and IgG-levels in sera from DC-LMP1/CD40 animals. Their serum antibodies specifically bound intestinal bacteria and we identified a 60 kDa chaperonin GroEL (Hsp60) from Helicobacter hepaticus (Hh) as the main specific antigen targeted in absence of iTregs. When rederived to a different Hh-free SPF-microbiota, mice showed few signs of disease without fatalities, but upon recolonization of mice with Hh we found rapid disease onset and the generation of inflammatory Th17/Th1 and Th1 cells in the colon. Thus, the present work identifies a major bacterial antigen and highlights the impact of specific microorganisms on modulating the host immune response and its role on disease onset, progression and outcome in this colitis model.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial viruses are widespread and abundant across natural and engineered habitats. They influence ecosystem functioning through interactions with their hosts. Laboratory studies of phage-host pairs have advanced our understanding of phenotypic and genetic diversification in bacteria and phages. However, the dynamics of phage-host interactions has been seldom recorded in complex natural environments. We conducted an observational metagenomic study of the dynamics of interaction between Gordonia and their phages using a three-year data series of samples collected from a full-scale wastewater treatment plant. The aim was to obtain a comprehensive picture of the coevolution dynamics in naturally evolving populations at relatively high time resolution. Co-evolution was followed by monitoring changes over time in the CRISPR loci of Gordonia metagenome-assembled genome, and reciprocal changes in the viral genome. Genome-wide analysis indicated low strain variability of Gordonia, and almost clonal conservation of the trailer-end of the CRISPR loci. Incorporation of newer spacers gave rise to multiple coexisting bacterial populations. A host population containing a CRISPR array variant, which did not contain spacers against the coexisting phages, accounted for more than half of the total host abundance in the majority of samples. Phages genome co-evolved by introducing directional changes, with no preference for mutations within the protospacer and PAM regions. Metagenomic reconstruction of time-resolved variants of host and virus genomes revealed how selection operates at the population level. In activated sludge, it differed from the arms-race observed in nutrient rich media and resembled the fluctuating selection dynamics observed in natural environments.",

    "abstract": "Introductory paragraphInfections caused by carbapenemase-producing enterobacteria (CPE) are a major concern in clinical settings worldwide. Two fundamentally different processes shape the epidemiology of CPE in hospitals: the dissemination of CPE clones from patient to patient (between-patient transfer), and the transfer of carbapenemase-encoding plasmids between enterobacteria in the gut microbiota of individual patients (within-patient transfer). The relative contribution of each process to the overall dissemination of carbapenem resistance in hospitals remains poorly understood. Here, we used mechanistic models combining epidemiological data from more than 9,000 patients with whole genome sequence information from 250 enterobacteria clones to characterise the dissemination routes of the carbapenemase-encoding plasmid pOXA-48 in a hospital setting over a two-year period. Our results revealed frequent between-patient transmission of high-risk pOXA-48-carrying clones, mostly of Klebsiella pneumoniae and sporadically Escherichia coli. The results also identified pOXA-48 dissemination hotspots within the hospital, such as specific wards and individual rooms within wards. Using high-resolution plasmid sequence analysis, we uncovered the pervasive within-patient transfer of pOXA-48, suggesting that horizontal plasmid transfer occurs in the gut of virtually every colonised patient. The complex and multifaceted epidemiological scenario exposed by this study provides new insights for the development of intervention strategies to control the in-hospital spread of CPE.",

Here, we describe the identification and evaluation of commercially available reagents and assays for the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 in infected formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) cell pellets. We identified a suitable rabbit polyclonal anti-SARS-CoV spike protein antibody and a mouse monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (NP) antibody for cross detection of the respective SARS-CoV-2 proteins by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Next, we established RNAscope in situ hybridization (ISH) to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Furthermore, we established a multiplex fluorescence ISH (mFISH) to detect positive-sense SARS-CoV-2 RNA and negative-sense SARS-CoV-2 RNA (a replicative intermediate indicating viral replication). Finally, we developed a dual staining assay using IHC and ISH to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigen and RNA in the same FFPE section. These reagents and assays will accelerate COVID-19 pathogenesis studies in humans and in COVID-19 animal models.",

    "abstract": "Starting in the early 2000s, a sophisticated technology has been developed for the rational construction of synthetic genetic networks that implement specified logical functionalities. Despite impressive progress, however, the scaling necessary in order to achieve greater computational power has been hampered by many constraints, including repressor toxicity and the lack of large sets of mutually-orthogonal repressors. As a consequence, a typical circuit contains no more than roughly seven repressor-based gates per cell. A possible way around this scalability problem is to distribute the computation among multiple cell types, which communicate among themselves using diffusible small molecules (DSMs) and each of which implements a small sub-circuit. Examples of DSMs are those employed by quorum sensing systems in bacteria. This paper focuses on systematic ways to implement this distributed approach, in the context of the evaluation of arbitrary Boolean functions.\n\nThe unique characteristics of genetic circuits and the properties of DSMs require the development of new Boolean synthesis methods, distinct from those classically used in electronic circuit design. In this work, we propose a fast algorithm to synthesize distributed realizations for any Boolean function, under constraints on the number of gates per cell and the number of orthogonal DSMs. The method is based on an exact synthesis algorithm to find the minimal circuit per cell, which in turn allows us to build an extensive database of Boolean functions up to a given number of inputs.\n\nFor concreteness, we will specifically focus on circuits of up to 4 inputs, which might represent, for example, two chemical inducers and two light inputs at different frequencies. Our method shows that, with a constraint of no more than seven gates per cell, the use of a single DSM increases the total number of realizable circuits by at least 7.58-fold compared to centralized computation. Moreover, when allowing two DSMs, one can realize 99.995% of all possible 4-input Boolean functions, still with at most 7 gates per cell. The methodology introduced here can be readily adapted to complement recent genetic circuit design automation software.",

    "abstract": "Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is characterized by short stature, skeletal deformities, low bone mass with bone fragility, and motor deficits. A subset of OI patients also present with joint hypermobility; however, the role of tendon/ligament dysfunction in OI pathogenesis is largely unknown. Using the Crtap-/- mouse model of severe, recessive OI, we found that mutant Achilles tendons and patellar ligaments were thinner with increased collagen cross-links and reduced collagen fibril size at 1- and 4-months compared to wildtype. Patellar ligaments from Crtap-/- mice also had fewer progenitors with a concomitant increase in immature cells. RNA-seq analysis of Achilles tendons and patellar ligaments from 1-month Crtap-/- mice revealed dysregulation in matrix gene expression concomitant with predicted alterations in TGF-{beta}, inflammatory, and metabolic signaling. Finally, a series of behavioral tests revealed severe motor impairments and reduced grip strength in 4-month Crtap-/- mice - a phenotype that correlates with the tendon/ligament pathology.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 pandemic has caused tens of thousands of deaths and is now a severe threat to global health. Clinical practice has demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 S1 specific antibodies and viral antigens can be used as diagnostic and prognostic markers of COVID-19. However, the popular point-of-care biomarker detection technologies, such as the lateral-flow test strips, provide only yes/no information and have very limited sensitivities. Thus, it has a high false negative rate and cannot be used for the quantitative evaluation of patients immune response. Conventional ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), on the other hand, can provide quantitative, accurate, and sensitive results, but it involves complicated and expensive instruments and long assay time. In addition, samples need to be sent to centralized labs, which significantly increases the turn-around time. Here, we present a microfluidic ELISA technology for rapid (15-20 minutes), quantitative, sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 biomarkers using SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and viral antigen - S protein in serum. We also characterized various humanized monoclonal IgG, and identified a candidate with a high binding affinity towards SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein that can serve as the calibration standard of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG in serological analyses. Furthermore, we demonstrated that our microfluidic ELISA platform can be used for rapid affinity evaluation of monoclonal anti-S1 antibodies. The microfluidic ELISA device is highly portable and requires less than 10 L of samples for each channel. Therefore, our technology will greatly facilitate rapid and quantitative analysis of COVID-19 patients and vaccine recipients at point-of-care.",

    "abstract": "Entry of SARS-CoV-2, etiological agent of COVID-19, in the host cell is driven by the interaction of its spike protein with human ACE2 receptor and a serine protease, TMPRSS2. Although complex between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ACE2 has been structurally resolved, the molecular details of the SARS-CoV-2 and TMPRSS2 complex are still elusive. TMPRSS2 is responsible for priming of the viral spike protein that entails cleavage of the spike protein at two potential sites, Arg685/Ser686 and Arg815/Ser816. The present study aims to investigate the conformational details of complex between TMPRSS2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, in order to discern the finer details of the priming of viral spike and to point candidate drug targets. Briefly, full length structural model of TMPRSS2 was developed and docked against the resolved structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with directional restraints of both cleavage sites. The docking simulations showed that TMPRSS2 interacts with the two different loops of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, each containing different cleavage sites. Key functional residues of TMPRSS2 (His296, Ser441 and Ser460) were found to interact with immediate flanking residues of cleavage sites of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Compared to the N-terminal cleavage site (Arg685/Ser686), TMPRSS2 region that interact with C-terminal cleavage site (Arg815/Ser816) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was predicted as relatively more druggable. In summary, the present study provide structural characteristics of molecular complex between human TMPRSS2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and points to the candidate drug targets that could further be exploited to direct structure base drug designing.",

Here, we developed gut organoid co-cultures with type-1 innate lymphoid cells (ILC1) to dissect the impact of their accumulation in inflamed intestines. We demonstrate for the first time that murine and human ILC1 secrete TGF{beta}1, driving expansion of CD44v6+ epithelial crypts. ILC1 additionally express MMP9 and drive gene signatures indicative of extracellular matrix remodelling. We therefore encapsulated human epithelial-mesenchymal intestinal organoids in MMP-sensitive, synthetic hydrogels designed to form efficient networks at low polymer concentrations. Harnessing this defined system, we demonstrate that ILC1 drive matrix softening and stiffening, which we suggest occurs through balanced matrix degradation and deposition. Our platform enabled us to elucidate previously undescribed interactions between ILC1 and their microenvironment, which suggest that they may exacerbate fibrosis and tumour growth when enriched in inflamed patient tissues.",

    "abstract": "The three dimensional architecture of the genome plays an essential role in establishing and maintaining cell identity. By contrast, the magnitude and temporal kinetics of changes in chromatin structure that arise during cell differentiation remain poorly understood. Here, we leverage a murine model of erythropoiesis to study the relationship between chromatin conformation, the epigenome, and transcription in erythroid cells. We discover that acute transcriptional responses induced by erythropoietin (EPO), the hormone necessary for erythroid differentiation, occur within an invariant chromatin topology. Within this pre-established landscape, Yin Yang 1 (YY1) occupancy dynamically redistributes to sites in proximity to EPO-regulated genes. Using HiChIP, we identify chromatin contacts mediated by H3K27ac and YY1 that are enriched for enhancer-promoter interactions of EPO-responsive genes. Taken together, these data are consistent with an emerging model that rapid, signal-dependent transcription occurs in the context of a pre-established chromatin architecture.",

    "abstract": "The chromatin modifier SETD2 was recently shown to be a dual-function methyltransferase that \"writes\" methyl marks on both chromatin and the mitotic spindle, revealing -tubulin methylation as a new posttranslational modification of microtubules. Here, we report the first cytoskeletal \"reader\" for this SETD2 methyl mark: the polybromo protein PBRM1. We found PBRM1 directly binds the -Tub-K40me3 mark on tubulin, and localizes to the mitotic spindle and spindle pole during cell division. PBRM1 can assemble a PBAF complex in the absence of chromatin as revealed by mass spectrometry, and can recruit other PBAF complex components including SMARCA4 and ARID2 to -tubulin. In addition to PBRM1, other PBAF components were also localized to the mitotic spindle and spindle pole. This PBAF localization was dependent on recruitment to microtubules by PBRM1, and loss of spindle-associated PBRM1/PBAF led to genomic instability as assessed by increased formation of micronuclei. These data reveal a previously unknown function for PBRM1 beyond its role remodeling chromatin, and expand the repertoire of chromatin remodelers involved in writing and reading methyl marks on the cytoskeleton. The results of this study lay the foundation for a new paradigm for the epigenetic machinery as chromatocytoskeletal modifiers, with coordinated nuclear and cytoskeletal functions.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are emerging as a universal means of cell-to-cell communication and hold great potential in diagnostics and regenerative therapies [1]. An urgent need in the field is a fundamental understanding of physiological mechanisms driving EV generation and function. Ciliary EVs act as signaling devices in Chlamydomonas and C. elegans [2-4]. Mammalian cilia shed EVs to eliminate unwanted receptors [5] or to retract cilia before entering the cell cycle [6]. Here we used our established C. elegans model to study sensory-evoked ciliary EV release and targeting using a fluorescently labeled EV cargo polycystin-2 (PKD-2). In C. elegans and mammals, the Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) gene products polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 localize to cilia and EVs, act in the same genetic pathway, and function in a sensory capacity, suggesting ancient conservation [7]. We find that males deposit PKD-2-carrying EVs onto the vulva of the hermaphrodite during mating. We also show that mechanical stimulation triggers release of PKD-2-carrying EVs from cilia. To our knowledge this is the first report of mechanoresponsive nature of the ciliary EV release and of ciliary EV directional transfer from one animal to another animal. Since the polycystins are evolutionarily conserved ciliary EV cargoes, our findings suggest that similar mechanisms for EV release and targeting may occur in other systems and biological contexts.",

    "abstract": "Cytoplasmic cilia, a specialized type of cilia in which the axoneme resides within the cytoplasm rather than within the ciliary compartment, are proposed to allow the efficient assembly of very long cilia. Despite being found diversely in male gametes (e.g. Plasmodium microgametocytes and human and Drosophila sperm), very little is known about cytoplasmic cilia assembly. Here we show that a novel RNP granule containing the mRNAs for axonemal dynein motor proteins becomes highly polarized to the distal end of the cilia during cytoplasmic ciliogenesis in Drosophila sperm. This allows for the localized translation of these axonemal dyneins and their incorporation into the axoneme directly from the cytoplasm. We found that this RNP granule contains the proteins Reptin and Pontin, loss of which perturbs granule formation and prevents incorporation of the axonemal dyneins, leading to sterility. We propose that cytoplasmic cilia require the local translation of key protein constituents such that these proteins are incorporated efficiently into the axoneme.\n\nAuthor SummaryCytoplasmic cilia, which are found in human and Drosophila sperm, are unique in that the axoneme is exposed to the cytoplasm. The authors show that a novel RNP granule containing axonemal dynein mRNAs facilitates localized translation of these axonemal proteins, facilitating cytoplasmic cilia formation.",

Adaptation of research protocols using reagents designated as research-only to those which are suitable for clinical use, often referred to as Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) reagents, is a crucial and laborious step in the translational pipeline. However, published protocols to assist this process remain very limited. Here we present a new GMP-compliant protocol to derive long-term neuroepithelial stem cell progenitors (lt-NES), which are multipotent, bankable, and karyotypically stable. This protocol resulted in robust and reproducible differentiation of several clinical-grade embryonic stem cells, deposited in the UK Stem Cell Bank, from which we derived lt-NES. Furthermore, GMP-derived lt-NES demonstrated a high neurogenic potential while retaining the ability to be redirected to several neuronal sub-types. Overall, we report the feasibility of derivation and differentiation of clinical grade embryonic stem cell lines into lt-NES under GMP-compliant conditions. Our protocols could be used as a flexible tool to speed up translation-to-clinic of pluripotent stem cells for a variety of neurological therapies or regenerative medicine studies.",

Here we combined human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to develop a model of the clonal evolution of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Through the sequential introduction of 3 disease-causing mutations (ASXL1 C-terminus truncation, SRSF2P95L and NRASG12D), we obtained single, double and triple mutant iPSC lines that, upon hematopoietic differentiation, exhibit progressive dysplasia with increasing number of mutations, capturing distinct premalignant stages, including clonal hematopoiesis, myelodysplastic syndrome, and culminating in a transplantable leukemia. iPSC-derived clonal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells recapitulate transcriptional and chromatin accessibility signatures of normal and malignant hematopoiesis found in primary human cells. By mapping dynamic changes in transcriptomes and chromatin landscapes, we characterize transcriptional programs driving specific stage transitions and identify vulnerabilities for early therapeutic targeting. Such synthetic \"de novo oncogenesis\" models can empower the investigation of multiple facets of the malignant transformation of human cells.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a growing problem that is projected to cause more deaths than cancer in 2050. Consequently, novel antibiotics are urgently needed. Since more than half of the available antibiotics target the bacterial ribosomes, proteins that are involved in protein synthesis are thus prime targets for the development of novel antibiotics. However, experimental identification of these potential antibiotic target proteins can be labor-intensive and challenging, as these proteins are likely to be poorly characterized and specific to few bacteria. In order to identify these novel proteins, we established a Large-Scale Transcriptomic Analysis Pipeline in Crowd (LSTrAP-Crowd), where 285 individuals processed 26 terabytes of RNA-sequencing data of the 17 most notorious bacterial pathogens. In total, the crowd processed 26,269 RNA-seq experiments and used the data to construct gene co-expression networks, which were used to identify more than a hundred uncharacterized genes that were transcriptionally associated with protein synthesis. We provide the identity of these genes together with the processed gene expression data. The data can be used to identify other vulnerabilities or bacteria, while our approach demonstrates how the processing of gene expression data can be easily crowdsourced.",

    "abstract": "BCL9 and PYGO are {beta}-catenin cofactors that enhance the transcription of Wnt target genes. They have been proposed as therapeutic targets to diminish Wnt signalling output in intestinal malignancies. Here we find that, in colorectal cancer cells and in developing mouse forelimbs, BCL9 proteins sustain the action of {beta}-catenin in a largely PYGO-independent manner. Our genetic analyses implied that BCL9 necessitates other interaction partners in mediating its transcriptional output. We identified the transcription factor TBX3 as a candidate tissue-specific member of the {beta}-catenin transcriptional complex. In developing forelimbs, TBX3 and BCL9 co-occupy a large number of Wnt-responsive regulatory elements, genome-wide. Moreover, mutations in Bcl9 affect the expression of TBX3 targets in vivo, and modulation of TBX3 abundance impacts on Wnt target genes transcription in a {beta}-catenin- and TCF/LEF-dependent manner. Finally, TBX3 overexpression exacerbates the metastatic potential of Wnt-dependent human colorectal cancer cells. Our work implicates TBX3 as a new, context-dependent component of the Wnt/{beta}-catenin-dependent enhanceosome.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear movement is a fundamental process of eukaryotic cell biology. Skeletal muscle presents an intriguing model to study nuclear movement because its development requires the precise positioning of multiple nuclei within a single cytoplasm. Furthermore, there is a high correlation between aberrant nuclear positioning and poor muscle function. Although many genes that regulate nuclear movement have been identified, the mechanisms by which these genes act is not known. Using Drosophila melanogaster muscle development as a model system, and a combination of live-embryo microscopy and laser ablation of nuclei, we have found that phenotypically similar mutants are based in different molecular disruptions. Specifically, ensconsin (Drosophila MAP7) regulates the number of growing microtubules that are used to move nuclei whereas bocksbeutel (Drosophila emerin) and klarsicht (Drosophila KASH-protein regulate interactions between nuclei.",

Segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) are sufficient to support Th17 cell differentiation in mouse, but the molecular and cellular requirements for this process remain incompletely characterized. Here we show that intestine-draining mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) are the dominant site of SFB-induced intestinal Th17 cell differentiation. Subsequent migration of these cells to the intestinal lamina propria is dependent on their up-regulation of integrin {beta}7. Stat3-dependent induction of ROR{gamma}t, the Th17 cell-specifying transcription factor, largely depends on IL-6, but signaling through the receptors for IL-21 and IL-23 can compensate for absence of IL-6 to promote SFB-directed Th17 cell differentiation. These results indicate that redundant cytokine signals guide commensal microbe-dependent Th17 cell differentiation in the MLN and accumulation of the cells in the lamina propria.",

    "abstract": "The development of vaccines against flaviviruses, including Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV), continues to be a major challenge, hindered by the lack of efficient and reliable methods for screening neutralizing activity of sera or antibodies. To address this need, we previously developed a plasmid-based, replication-incompetent DENV reporter virus particle (RVP) production system as an efficient and safe alternative to the Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT). As part of the response to the 2015-2016 ZIKV outbreak, we recently developed pseudo-infectious ZIKV RVPs by modifying our DENV RVP system. The use of ZIKV RVPs as critical reagents in human clinical trials requires their further validation using stability and reproducibility metrics for large-scale applications. In the current study, we validated ZIKV RVPs using infectivity, neutralization, and enhancement assays with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and human ZIKV-positive patient serum. ZIKV RVPs are antigenically identical to live virus based on binding ELISA and neutralization results and are nonreplicating based on the results of plaque formation assays. We demonstrate reproducible neutralization titer data (NT50 values) across different RVP production lots, volumes, time frames, and laboratories. We also show RVP stability across experimentally relevant time intervals and temperatures. Our results demonstrate that ZIKV RVPs provide a safe, rapid, and reproducible reagent for large-scale, long-term studies of neutralizing antibodies and sera, which can facilitate large-scale screening and epidemiological studies to help expedite ZIKV vaccine development.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYZIKV is a mosquito-borne virus that can cause severe birth defects and other disorders. Large outbreaks of ZIKV occurred in 2015 and 2016 and there are still no drugs or vaccines available to protect against ZIKV infection. Vaccine development has been hindered by the lack of safe and efficient methods to screen ZIKV neutralizing properties of patient sera or antibodies, especially in the context of large clinical trials. To address this unmet need, we developed and validated the use of ZIKV reporter virus particles (RVPs), a safe, high-throughput and quantitative alternative to using live virus for neutralization studies. We show that ZIKV RVPs are stable, show lot-to-lot consistency and provide reproducible neutralization data that is suitable for large-scale studies are needed for development of a ZIKV vaccine, epidemiologic surveillance, and high-throughput screening.",

A major challenge in imaging analysis is accurate segmentation, a process to define the boundaries of cells based on raw image data.

Here, we demonstrated that combined with multi-layer training set strategy, a neural-network-based algorithm Cellbow can achieve accurate and robust segmentation of cells in broad and general settings. It can also facilitate long-term tracking of cell growth and division. Furthermore, Cellbow is customizable and generalizable. It is broadly applicable to segmenting fluorescent images of diverse cell types with no further training needed. For bright-field images, only a small set of sample images of the specific cell type from the user may be needed for training.

We evaluated 19 skeletal parameters in 733 knockout mouse lines and reveal 26 osteocyte transcriptome signature genes that control bone structure and function. We showed osteocyte transcriptome signature genes are enriched for human orthologs that cause monogenic skeletal disorders (P=2.4x10-22) and are associated with the polygenic diseases osteoporosis (P=1.8x10-13) and osteoarthritis (P=1.6x10-7). Thus, we reveal the molecular landscape that regulates osteocyte network formation and function and establish the importance of osteocytes in human skeletal disease.",

We find that many of the most significant hits are readily and surprisingly interpretable. We observe huge enrichment of associations near genes involved in the relevant biosynthesis, transport, or signaling pathways. We show how GWAS data illuminate the biology of each trait, including differences in testosterone regulation between females and males. At the same time, even these molecular traits are highly polygenic, with many thousands of variants spread across the genome contributing to trait variance. In summary, for these three molecular traits we identify strong enrichment of signal in putative core gene sets, even while most of the SNP-based heritability is driven by a massively polygenic background.",

Each subunit is composed of the extracellular Venus flytrap (VFT) domain and transmembrane (TM) domain. Here we present cryo-EM structures of human full-length heterodimeric GABAB receptor in the antagonist-bound inactive state and in the active state complexed with agonist and positive allosteric modulator in the presence of Gi1 protein at a resolution range of 2.8-3.0 [A]. Cryo-EM analysis of the activated-GABAB-Gi1 complex revealed that Gi1 couples to the activated receptor primarily in three major conformations, one via GB1 TM and two via GB2 TM, respectively. Our structures reveal that agonist binding stabilizes the closure of GB1 VFT, which in turn triggers a rearrangement of TM interfaces between two subunits from TM3-TM5/TM3-TM5 in the inactive state to TM6/TM6 in the active state and finally induces the opening of intracellular loop 3 and synergistically shifting of TM3, 4 and 5 helices in GB2 TM domain to accommodate the 5-helix of Gi1.

    "abstract": "The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) organises in supramolecular structures on the surface of lipid bilayers to drive membrane invagination and scission of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs), a process also controlled by membrane mechanics. However, ESCRT association with the membrane is also mediated by electrostatic interactions with anionic phospholipids. Phospholipid distribution within natural biomembranes is inhomogeneous due to, for example, the formation of lipid rafts and curvature-driven lipid sorting. Here, we have used phase-separated giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) to investigate the link between phosphatidylserine (PS)-rich lipid domains and ESCRT activity. We employ GUVs composed of phase separating lipid mixtures, where unsaturated DOPS and saturated DPPS lipids are incorporated individually or simultaneously to enhance PS localisation in liquid disordered (Ld) and/or liquid ordered (Lo) domains, respectively. PS partitioning between the coexisting phases is confirmed by a fluorescent Annexin V probe. Ultimately, we find that ILV generation promoted by ESCRTs is significantly enhanced when PS lipids localise within Ld domains. However, the ILVs that form are rich in Lo lipids. We interpret this surprising observation as preferential recruitment of the Lo phase beneath the ESCRT complex due to its increased rigidity, where the Ld phase is favoured in the neck of the resultant buds to facilitate the high membrane curvature in these regions of the membrane during the ILV formation process. Ld domains offer lower resistance to membrane bending, demonstrating a mechanism by which the composition and mechanics of membranes can be coupled to regulate the location and efficiency of ESCRT activity.",

While individual mediators of these processes have been investigated, interactions between these mediators remain less well defined. We previously identified a structural complex between receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met and {beta}1 integrin in metastases. Using novel cell culture and in vivo assays, we found that c-Met/{beta}1 complex induction promotes breast cancer intravasation and adhesion to the vessel wall, but does not increase extravasation. These effects may be driven by the ability of the c-Met/{beta}1 complex to increase mesenchymal and stem cell characteristics. Multiplex transcriptomic analysis revealed upregulated Wnt and hedgehog pathways after c-Met/{beta}1 complex induction. A {beta}1 integrin point mutation that prevented binding to c-Met reduced intravasation. OS2966, a therapeutic antibody disrupting c-Met/{beta}1 binding, decreased invasion and mesenchymal gene expression and morphology of breast cancer cells. Bone-seeking breast cancer cells exhibited higher c-Met/{beta}1 complex levels than parental controls and preferentially adhere to tissue-specific matrix. Patient bone metastases demonstrated higher c-Met/{beta}1 levels than brain metastases. Thus, the c-Met/{beta}1 complex drives breast cancer cell intravasation and preferential affinity for bone tissue-specific matrix.

    "abstract": "TRIM5 is a key cross-species barrier to retroviral infection, with certain TRIM5 alleles conferring increased risk of HIV-1 infection in humans. TRIM5 is best known as a species-specific restriction factor that directly inhibits the viral life cycle. Additionally, it is also a pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) that activates inflammatory signaling. How TRIM5 carries out its multi-faceted actions in antiviral defense remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that proteins required for autophagy, a cellular self-digestion pathway, play an important role in TRIM5s function as a PRR. Genetic depletion of proteins involved in all stages of the autophagy pathway prevented TRIM5-driven expression of NF-{kappa}B and AP1 responsive genes. One of these genes is the preeminent antiviral cytokine interferon {beta} (IFN-{beta}), whose TRIM5-dependent expression was lost in cells lacking the autophagy proteins ATG7, BECN1, and ULK1. Moreover, we found that the ability of TRIM5 to stimulate IFN-{beta} expression in response to recognition of a TRIM5-restricted HIV-1 capsid mutant (P90A) was abrogated in cells lacking autophagy factors. Stimulation of human macrophage-like cells with the P90A virus protected them against subsequent infection with an otherwise resistant wild type HIV-1 in a manner requiring TRIM5, BECN1, and ULK1. Mechanistically, TRIM5 was attenuated in its ability to activate the kinase TAK1 in autophagy deficient cells, and both BECN1 and ATG7 contributed to the assembly of TRIM5-TAK1 complexes. These data demonstrate a non-canonical role for the autophagy machinery in assembling antiviral signaling complexes and demonstrate a role for autophagy in the establishment of a TRIM5-dependent antiviral state.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTTRIM5 is an antiretroviral protein that employs multiple mechanisms to protect cells against infection. Previous studies have linked TRIM5 to autophagy, a cytoplasmic quality control pathway with numerous roles in immunity, raising the possibility that TRIM5 engages autophagy in antiviral defense. This concept has been controversial, since TRIM5s best-known role as a directly acting antiretroviral effector is autophagy independent. However, retroviral restriction is only one aspect of TRIM5 function. We demonstrate that autophagy is crucial to another TRIM5 action: its role as a pattern-recognition receptor. We show that autophagy machinery is required for TRIM5 to transduce antiviral signaling and to establish an antiretroviral state. Our data indicate that autophagy provides TRIM5 with a platform upon which to activate antiviral responses.",

    "abstract": "SYNGAP1 is a Ras and Rap GTPase with important roles in regulating excitatory synaptic plasticity. While many SYNGAP1 missense and nonsense mutations have been associated with intellectual disability, epilepsy, schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), there are many variants of unknown significance (VUS). In this report, we characterize 58 variants in nine assays that examine multiple aspects of SYNGAP1 function. Specifically, we used multiplex phospho-flow cytometry to measure the impact of variants on pERK, pGSK3{beta} and pCREB and high-content imaging to examine their subcellular localization. We find variants ranging from complete loss-of-function (LoF) to wildtype (WT)-like in their ability to regulate pERK and pGSK3{beta}, while all variants retain at least partial ability to regulate pCREB. Interestingly, our assays reveal that a high percentage of variants located within the disordered domain of unknown function that makes up the C-terminal half of SYNGAP1 exhibited LoF, compared to the more well studied catalytic domain. Moreover, we find protein instability to be a major contributor to dysfunction only for two missense variants both located within the catalytic domain. Using high-content imaging, we find variants with nuclear enrichment/exclusion and aberrant nuclear speckle localization. These variants are primarily located within the C2 domain known to mediate membrane lipid interactions. We find that mislocalization is distinct from altered catalytic activity, highlighting multiple independent molecular mechanisms underlying variant dysfunction. Our multidimensional dataset allows clustering of variants based on functional phenotypes and provides high-confidence pathogenicity classification.",

    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), and anxiety disorders. The disruption in the function of the FMR1 gene results in a range of alterations in cellular and synaptic function. Previous studies have identified dynamic alterations in inhibitory neurotransmission in early postnatal development in the amygdala of the mouse model of FXS. Yet little is known how these changes alter microcircuit development and plasticity in the lateral amygdala (LA). Using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology, we demonstrate that principal neurons (PNs) in the LA exhibit hyperexcitability with a concomitant increase in the synaptic strength of excitatory synapses in the BLA. Further, reduced feed-forward inhibition appears to enhance synaptic plasticity in the FXS amygdala. These results demonstrate that plasticity is enhanced in the amygdala of the juvenile Fmr1 KO mouse and that E/I imbalance may underpin anxiety disorders commonly seen in FXS and ASDs.",

    "abstract": "The generation of pancreatic endocrine progenitor cells is an important step in the differentiation of beta cells from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC). This stage is marked by the expression of Nkx6.1, a transcription factor with well understood downstream targets but with unclear upstream regulators. In hPSC differentiation, Nkx6.1 is strongly induced by nicotinamide, a derivative of vitamin B3, which has three known functions within a cell. Nicotinamide inhibits two classes of enzymes known as poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs) and sirtuins. It also contributes to the cellular pool of nicotinamide adenosine deoxynucleotide (NAD+) after conversion in the nicotinamide salvage pathway. Induction of Nkx6.1 expression in pancreatic endocrine progenitors by nicotinamide was mimicked by 3 PARP inhibitors (PJ34, olaparib, NU1025). Small molecule inhibition of the nicotinamide salvage pathway reduced Nkx6.1 expression but not Pdx1 expression and caused alteration in NAD+/NADH ratio. Nkx6.1 expression was not affected by sirtuin inhibition. Metabolic profiling of differentiating pancreatic and endocrine progenitors showed that oxygen consumption increases as differentiation progresses, and that nicotinamide reduces oxygen consumption rate. Expression of Nkx6.1 and other beta cell related genes, including Ins2 and Pdx1 increased in mouse islets after exposure to nicotinamide. In summary, nicotinamide induced Nkx6.1 expression in differentiating human pancreatic endocrine progenitors through inhibition of the PARP family of enzymes. Nicotinamide administration was also associated with increased NAD+/NADH ratio, without affecting Nkx6.1 expression. Similarly, the association between nicotinamide and Nkx6.1 expression was also seen in isolated mouse islets. These observations show a link between the regulation of beta cell identity and the effectors of NAD+ metabolism, suggesting possible therapeutic targets in the field of diabetes.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionSmooth muscle cells (SMC) play a critical role in atherosclerosis. The Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is an environment-sensing transcription factor that contributes to vascular development, and has been implicated in coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. We hypothesized that AHR can affect atherosclerosis by regulating phenotypic modulation of SMC.\n\nMethodsWe combined RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, ATAC-Seq and in-vitro assays in human coronary artery SMC (HCASMC), with single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq), histology, and RNAscope in an SMC-specific lineage-tracing Ahr knockout mouse model of atherosclerosis to better understand the role of AHR in vascular disease.\n\nResultsGenomic studies coupled with functional assays in cultured HCASMC revealed that AHR modulates HCASMC phenotype and suppresses ossification in these cells. Lineage tracing and activity tracing studies in the mouse aortic sinus showed that the Ahr pathway is active in modulated SMC in the atherosclerotic lesion cap. Furthermore, scRNA-Seq studies of the SMC-specific Ahr knockout mice showed a significant increase in the proportion of modulated SMC expressing chondrocyte markers such as Col2a1 and Alpl, which localized to the lesion neointima. These cells, which we term \"chondromyocytes\" (CMC), were also identified in the neointima of human coronary arteries. In histological analyses, these changes manifested as larger lesion size, increased lineage-traced SMC participation in the lesion, decreased lineage-traced SMC in the lesion cap, and increased alkaline phosphatase activity in lesions in the Ahr knockout compared to wild-type mice. We propose that AHR is likely protective based on these data and inference from human genetic analyses.\n\nConclusionOverall, we conclude that AHR promotes maintenance of lesion cap integrity and diminishes the disease related SMC-to-CMC transition in atherosclerotic tissues.",

One strategy that is gaining momentum is to utilize iPSC-derived hepatocytes from individual human subjects in complex cell/organ platforms with the goal of reproducing a NAFLD-like state in vitro.3-6 Our group has taken a different approach, positing that iPSC-Heps from a population of NAFLD patients would provide independent insight into the human disease. In this study we generated iPSCs and iPSC-Heps from a well-defined cohort of NAFLD patients. Our objective was to determine whether as a group, in the absence of any metabolic challenge, they exhibit common disease-specific signatures that are distinct from healthy controls.Competing Interest StatementThis work was funded by research grants from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (IT1-06563), AbbVie, Inc. and NIH: R21 DK118380 (JJM), UG3 DK120004 (HW) and K08 DK098270 (ANM).

Beta isoform-specific bridges E45:R694 and E98:R694 were discovered in the molecular dynamics simulations of the alpha and beta myosin isoforms. Alpha and beta isoforms exhibit different kinetics, ADP dissociates slower from actomyosin containing beta myosin isoform, therefore, beta myosin stays strongly bound to actin longer. We hypothesize that the electrostatic interactions in the force-generating region modulate affinity of ADP to actomyosin, and therefore, the time of the strong actomyosin binding. Wild type and the mutants of the myosin head construct (1-843 amino acid residues) were expressed in differentiated C2C12 cells, and duration of the strongly bound state of actomyosin was characterized using transient kinetics spectrophotometry. All myosin constructs exhibited a fast rate of ATP binding to actomyosin and a slow rate of ADP dissociation, showing that ADP release limits the time of the strongly bound state of actomyosin. Mutant R694N showed faster rate of ADP release from actomyosin, compared to the wild type and the E45Q mutant, thus confirming that electrostatic interactions within the force-generating region of human cardiac myosin regulate ADP release and the duration of the strongly bound state of actomyosin.",

    "abstract": "Cell fate is maintained over long timescales, yet molecular fluctuations can lead to spontaneous loss of this differentiated state. We uncovered a mechanism that explains life-long maintenance of ASE neuron fate in C. elegans by the terminal selector transcription factor CHE-1. Fluctuations in CHE-1 level are buffered by the reservoir of CHE-1 bound at its target promoters, which ensure continued che-1 expression by preferentially binding the che-1 promoter. We validated this mechanism by showing that che-1 expression was resilient to induced transient CHE-1 depletion, while both expression of CHE-1 targets and ASE function were lost. We identified a 130 bp che-1 promoter fragment responsible for this resilience, with deletion of a homeodomain binding site in this fragment causing stochastic loss of ASE identity long after its determination. Because network architectures that support this mechanism are highly conserved in cell differentiation, it may explain stable cell fate maintenance in many systems.",

However, few studies have assessed rates of phenotypic evolution and disparity across broad scales of time to understand the evolutionary dynamics behind the origin of major clades, or how they relate to rates of molecular evolution. Here, we provide a total evidence approach to this problem using the largest available data set on diapsid reptiles. We find a strong decoupling between phenotypic and molecular rates of evolution, with many periods of accelerated phenotypic evolution or expansion of phenotypic disparity at the origin of major reptile clades and body plans that do not correspond to periods of adaptive radiation. We find heterogeneous rates of evolution during the acquisition of similarly adapted functional types, and that the origin of snakes is marked by exceptionally high evolutionary rates.",

    "abstract": "Growth hormone-activated STAT5b is an essential regulator of sex-differential gene expression in mouse liver, however, its impact on hepatic gene expression and epigenetic responses is poorly understood. Here, we found a substantial, albeit incomplete loss of liver sex bias in hepatocyte-specific STAT5a/STAT5b (collectively, STAT5)-deficient mouse liver. In male liver, many male-biased genes were down regulated in direct association with the loss of STAT5 binding; many female-biased genes, which show low STAT5 binding, were de-repressed, indicating an indirect mechanism for repression by STAT5. Extensive changes in CpG-methylation were seen in STAT5-deficient liver, where sex differences in DNA methylation were abolished at 88% of ~1,500 differentially-methylated regions, largely due to an increase in methylation at the hypomethylated sites. STAT5-dependent CpG-hypomethylation was rarely found at proximal promoters of STAT5-dependent genes. Rather, STAT5 primarily regulated the methylation of distal enhancers, where STAT5 deficiency induced widespread hypermethylation at genomic regions enriched for accessible chromatin, enhancer histone marks (H3K4me1, H3K27ac), STAT5 binding, and DNA motifs for STAT5 and other transcription factors implicated in liver sex differences. In conclusion, the sex-dependent binding of STAT5 to liver chromatin is closely linked to sex-dependent demethylation of distal regulatory elements mapping to STAT5-dependent genes important for liver sex bias.",

We use validated models of migraine to show that HDAC6-inhibition is a promising migraine treatment and reveal an undiscovered cytoarchitectural basis for migraine chronicity. The human migraine trigger, nitroglycerin, produced chronic migraine-associated pain and decreased neurite growth in headache-processing regions, which were reversed by HDAC6 inhibition. Cortical spreading depression (CSD), a physiological correlate of migraine aura, also decreased cortical neurite growth, while HDAC6-inhibitor restored neuronal complexity and decreased CSD. Importantly, a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist also restored blunted neuronal complexity induced by nitroglycerin. Our results demonstrate that disruptions in neuronal cytoarchitecture are a feature of chronic migraine, and effective migraine therapies might include agents that restore microtubule/neuronal plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Substance use disorders are prevalent and present a tremendous societal cost but the mechanisms underlying addiction behavior are poorly understood and few biological treatments exist. One strategy to identify novel molecular mechanisms of addiction is through functional genomic experimentation. However, results from individual experiments are often noisy. To address this problem, the convergent analysis of multiple genomic experiments can prioritize signal from these studies. In the present study, we examine genetic loci identified in the recombinant inbred (BXD RI) genetic reference population that modulate the locomotor response to cocaine. We then applied the GeneWeaver software system for heterogeneous functional genomic analysis to integrate and aggregate multiple studies of addiction genomics, resulting in the identification of Rab3b, as a functional correlate of the locomotor response to cocaine in rodents. This gene encodes a member of the RAB family of Ras-like GTPases known to be involved in trafficking of secretory and endocytic vesicles in eukaryotic cells. The convergent evidence for a role of Rab3b was included co-occurrence in previously published genetic mapping studies of cocaine related behaviors; methamphetamine response and Cartpt (Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript prepropeptide) abundance; evidence related to other addictive substances; density of polymorphisms; and its expression pattern in reward pathways. To evaluate this finding, we examined the effect of RAB3 complex perturbation in cocaine response. B6;129-Rab3btm1Sud Rab3ctm1sud Rab3dtm1sud triple null mice (Rab3bcd-/-) exhibited significant deficits in habituation, and increased acute and repeated cocaine responses. This previously unidentified mechanism of the behavioral predisposition and response to cocaine is an example of many that can be identified and validated using aggregate genomic studies.\n\nMany genetic and genomic studies have been performed over the past few decades, representing a wealth of data on the underlying neurobiological and genetic basis of multiple complex behaviors. However, these studies, particularly legacy studies using older technologies and resources lack precision. By aggregating multiple studies, convergent evidence for shared molecular mechanisms of multiple behaviors can be found, for example the widely reported relations among psychostimulant use and novelty response behavior. Here a legacy genetic mapping result for a cocaine related trait mapped in mice was refined using data from 113 different experimental gene sets related to addiction in the GeneWeaver system for heterogeneous functional genomic analysis. Convergent evidence revealed a role for Rab3b in this and other traits including multiple psychostimulant responses and CART expression. Experimental perturbation of the RAB complex revealed effects on habituation to a novel environment, cocaine induced activation and Carpt expression. The analysis of aggregate data thus revealed a molecular mechanism that influences the relationship between response to novel situations and cocaine-related phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Determining how DNA variants affect the binding of regulatory complexes to cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and non-coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (ncSNPs) is a challenge in genomics. To address this challenge, we have developed CASCADE (Comprehensive ASsessment of Complex Assembly at DNA Elements), which is a protein-binding microarray (PBM)-based approach that allows for the high-throughput profiling of cofactor (COF) recruitment to DNA sequence variants. The method also enables one to infer the identity of the transcription factor-cofactor (TF-COF) complexes involved in COF recruitment. We use CASCADE to characterize regulatory complexes binding to CREs and SNP quantitative trait loci (SNP-QTLs) in resting and stimulated human macrophages. By profiling the recruitment of the acetyltransferase p300 and MLL methyltransferase component RBBP5, we identify key regulators of the chemokine CXCL10, and by profiling a set of five functionally diverse COFs we identify a prevalence of ETS sites mediating COF recruitment at SNP-QTLs in macrophages. Our results demonstrate that CASCADE is a customizable, high-throughput platform to link DNA variants with the biophysical complexes that mediate functions such as chromatin modification or remodeling in a cell state-specific manner.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal cell diversity is essential to endow distinct brain regions with specific functions. During development, progenitors within these regions are characterised by specific gene expression programs, contributing to the generation of diversity in postmitotic neurons and glia. While the region-specific molecular diversity of neurons and astrocytes is increasingly understood, whether these cells share region-specific programs remains unknown. Here, we show that in the neocortex and thalamus, neurons and astrocytes express shared region-specific transcriptional and epigenetic signatures. These signatures not only distinguish cells across brain regions but are also detected across substructures within regions, such as distinct thalamic nuclei, where clonal analysis revealed the existence of common nucleus-specific progenitors for neurons and glia. Consistent with their shared molecular signature, regional specificity was maintained following astrocyte-to-neuron reprogramming. A detailed understanding of these regional-specific signatures may thus inform strategies for future cell-based brain repair.",

    "abstract": "Transforming growth factor {beta} (TGF{beta}) plays an important role in tooth morphogenesis and mineralization. Our laboratory established a mouse model in which Tgfbr2 was conditionally deleted in the dental pulp (DP) mesenchyme using an Osterix promoter-driven Cre recombinase (Tgfbr2cko). These mice survived postnatally, but had significant defects in bones and teeth, including reduced mineralization and short roots. H&E staining revealed reduced axon-like structures in the mutant mice. Reporter imaging demonstrated that Osterix-Cre activity was localized within the tooth and was active in the DP and derivatives, but not in neurons. Previous research has established that paracrine signals from the dental pulp attract trigeminal axons toward and into the tooth during postnatal development, yet very little is known about the signals that regulate tooth innervation. Immunofluorescent staining for a neuronal marker, {beta}3 tubulin, was performed on serial cryosections from control and mutant molars at two different postnatal stages. Confocal imaging and pixel quantification of {beta}3 tubulin demonstrated reduced innervation in P7 and P24 Tgfbr2cko first molars compared to controls, indicating that the signals necessary to promote neurite outgrowth were disrupted by Tgfbr2 deletion. Quantitative real time PCR showed that the mRNA expression levels of several neuronal genes were reduced. Lastly, trigeminal neurons were co-cultured atop Transwell filters overlying primary Tgfbr2f/f DP cells. Tgfbr2 in the DP was deleted with an adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase. Confocal imaging of axons through the filter pores showed increased axonal sprouting from neurons cultured in the presence of Tgfbr2-positive DP cells compared to neurons cultured alone. Further, axon sprouting was reduced when Tgfbr2 was knocked down in the DP cells. These results indicate that Tgfbr2 in the DP mesenchyme regulates paracrine signals that guide sensory innervation of the tooth.\n\nNote: A list of abbreviations is included in the appendix.",

    "abstract": "Xenopus laevis has a lateral line mechanosensory system throughout its full life cycle. Previous studies of the tadpole lateral line system revealed that it may play a role in escape behaviour. In this study, we used DASPEI staining to reveal the location of tadpole lateral line neuromasts. Destroying these neuromasts with neomycin resulted in loss of escape responses in tadpoles. We then studied the physiology of anterior lateral line in immobilised tadpoles. Activating the neuromasts behind one eye could evoke asymmetrical motor nerve discharges when the tadpole was resting, suggestive of turning/escape, followed by fictive swimming. When the tadpole was already producing fictive swimming however, anterior lateral line activation reliably led to the termination of swimming. The anterior lateral line had spontaneous afferent discharges at rest, and when activated showed typical adaptation. There were also efferent activities during tadpole swimming, the activity of which was loosely in phase with ipsilateral motor nerve discharges, implying modulation by the motor circuit from the same side. Calcium imaging experiments located sensory interneurons in the primary anterior lateral line nucleus in the hindbrain. Future studies are needed to reveal how sensory information is processed by the central circuit to determine tadpole motor behaviour.\n\nSummary statementActivating tadpole anterior lateral line evokes escape responses followed by swimming and halts ongoing swimming. The afferent and efferent activities and sensory interneuron locations in the hindbrain are reported.",

    "abstract": "Estimating heritability (h2) is required to predict the response to selection and is useful in species that are managed or farmed using trait information. Estimating h2 in free-ranging populations is challenging due to the need for pedigrees; genomic-relatedness matrices (GRMs) circumvent this need and can be implemented in nearly any system where phenotypic and SNP data are available. We estimated the heritability of five body and three antler traits in a free-ranging population of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) on Anticosti Island, Quebec, Canada. We generated GRMs from >10,000 SNPs: dressed body mass and peroneus muscle mass had moderate h2 values of 0.49 and 0.56, respectively. Heritability in male-only antler features ranged from 0.00 to 0.51 and had high standard errors. We explored the influence of minor allele frequency and data completion filters on h2: GRMs derived from fewer SNPs had reduced h2 estimates and the relatedness coefficients significantly deviated from those generated with more SNPs. As a corollary, we discussed limitations to the application of GRMs in the wild, notably how skewed GRMs increase variance around h2 estimates. This is the first study to estimate h2 on a free-ranging population of white-tailed deer and should be informative for breeding designs and management.",

Here we show that both disease-associated mutations of TRPM3 render the channel overactive, but likely via different mechanisms. The Val to Met substitution in the S4-S5 loop induced a larger increase in basal activity and agonist sensitivity at room temperature than the Pro to Gln substitution in the extracellular segment of S6. In contrast, heat activation was increased more by the S6 mutant than by the S4-S5 segment mutant.

    "abstract": "New treatments for diseases caused by antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms can be developed by identifying unexplored therapeutic targets and by designing efficient drug screening protocols. In this study, we have screened a library of compounds to find ligands for the flavin-adenine dinucleotide synthase (FADS) -a potential target for drug design against tuberculosis and pneumonia- by implementing a new and efficient virtual screening protocol. The protocol has been developed for the in silico search of ligands of unexplored therapeutic targets, for which limited information about ligands or ligand-receptor structures is available. It implements an integrative funnel-like strategy with filtering layers that increase in computational accuracy. The protocol starts with a pharmacophore-based virtual screening strategy that uses ligand-free receptor conformations from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Then, it performs a molecular docking stage using several docking programs and an exponential consensus ranking strategy. The last filter, samples the conformations of compounds bound to the target using MD simulations. The MD conformations are scored using several traditional scoring functions in combination with a newly-proposed score that takes into account the fluctuations of the molecule with a Morse-based potential. The protocol was optimized and validated using a compound library with known ligands of the Corynebacterium ammoniagenes FADS. Then, it was used to find new FADS ligands from a compound library of 14,000 molecules. A small set of 17 in silico filtered molecules were tested experimentally. We identified five inhibitors of the activity of the flavin adenylyl transferase mononucleotide of the FADS, and some of them were able to inhibit growth of three bacterial species: Corynebacterium ammoniagenes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, where the former two are human pathogens. Overall, the results show that the integrative VS protocol is a cost-effective solution for the discovery of ligands of unexplored therapeutic targets.\n\nAuthor summaryDeveloping cures for antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms is a pressing necessity. Addressing this problem requires the discovery of novel therapeutic targets -for example, bacterial proteins with no human homologues- and the development of cost-effective drug screening protocols. In this work, we tackled the problem on both sides. We developed an efficient and successful integrative computational protocol for screening inhibitory-molecules for unexplored targets. We used it to discover five novel inhibitors of flavin-adenine dinucleotide synthase (FADS), a promising protein target of pathogens causing tuberculosis and pneumonia.",

    "abstract": "Competition for resources often contributes strongly to defining an organisms ecological niche. Biological rhythms are important adaptations to the temporal dimension of niches, but the role of other organisms in determining such temporal niches have not been much studied, and the role specifically of competition even less so. We investigate how interspecific and intraspecific competition for resources shapes an organisms activity rhythms. For this, communities of one or two species in an environment with limited resource input were simulated. We demonstrate that when organisms are arrhythmic, one species will always be competitively excluded from the environment, but the existence of activity rhythms allows niche differentiation and indefinite coexistence of the two species. Two species which are initially active at the same phase will differentiate their phase angle of entrainment over time to avoid each other. When only one species is present in an environment, competition within individuals of the species strongly selects for niche expansion through arrhythmicity, but the addition of an interspecific competitor facilitates evolution of increased rhythmic amplitude when combined with additional adaptations for temporal specialization. Finally, if individuals preferentially mate with others who are active at similar times of day, then disruptive selection by intraspecific competition can split one population into two reproductively isolated groups. In summary, these simulations suggest that biological rhythms are an effective method to temporally differentiate ecological niches, and that competition is an important ecological pressure promoting the evolution of rhythms and sleep.\n\nAuthor summaryWhy do we sleep? We are interested in the ecological factors which promote the evolution of biological rhythms like the sleep-wake cycle, focusing especially on competition. When animals compete with each other for resources, they often evolve to avoid each other by specializing to use different resources or separating their activity in other ways. To test hypotheses about how competition shapes rest-activity rhythms, we performed computer simulations of a community of animals who move, reproduce, and compete for resources. We show that biological rhythms let two species divide time so that one species is active while its competitor is resting, thus avoiding depleting shared resources. When a species has no competitors in the simulation, competition between members of the same species cause population and individual rhythms to decrease, since resource availability is low when everybody is active at the same time. However, having competitors allows strong rhythms to evolve from originally arrhythmic organisms. Competition can even cause a single population to split into two species which are separated in time. In summary, these results suggest that competition is a strong factor promoting rest-activity rhythms.",

    "abstract": "Ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) are a valuable animal model used in biomedical research. Ferrets undergo significant variation in body weight seasonally, affected by photoperiod, and these variations make it difficult to use weight as an indicator of health status. To overcome this requires a better understanding of these seasonal weight changes. We provide a normative weight data set for the female ferret accounting for seasonal changes, and also investigate the effect of fluid regulation on weight change. Female ferrets (n=39) underwent behavioural testing from May 2017 to August 2019 and were weighed daily while housed in an animal care facility with controlled light exposure. In the winter (October to March), animals experienced 10 hours of light and 14 hours of dark, while in summer (March to October), this contingency was reversed. Individual animals varied in their body weight from approximately 700 to 1200 g. However, weights fluctuated with light cycle, with animals losing weight in summer, and gaining weight in winter such that they fluctuated between approximately 80% and 120% of their long term average weight. Ferrets were weighed as part of their health assessment while experiencing water regulation for behavioural training. Water regulation superimposed additional weight changes on these seasonal fluctuations, with weight loss during the 5 day water regulation period being greater in summer than winter. These data establish a normative benchmark for seasonal weight variation in female ferrets that can be incorporated into the health assessment of an animals condition.",

    "abstract": "Zinc ions (Zn2+) are important messenger molecules involved in various physiological functions. To maintain the homeostasis of cytosolic Zn2+ concentration ([Zn2+]c), Zrt/Irt-related proteins (ZIPs) and Zn2+ transporters (ZnTs) are the two families of proteins responsible for decreasing and increasing the [Zn2+]c, respectively, by fluxing Zn2+ across the membranes of the cell and intracellular compartments in opposite directions. Most studies focus on the cytotoxicity incurred by a high concentration of [Zn2+]c and less investigate the [Zn2+]c at physiological levels. Zinc oxide-nanoparticle (ZnO-NP) is blood brain barrier-permeable and elevates the [Zn2+]c to different levels according to the concentrations of ZnO-NP applied. In this study, we mildly elevated the [Zn2+]c by zinc oxide-nanoparticles (ZnO-NP) at concentrations below 1 g/ml, which had little cytotoxicity, in cultured human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and characterized the importance of Zn2+ transporters in 6-hydroxy dopamine (6-OHDA)-induced cell death. The results show that ZnO-NP at low concentrations elevated the [Zn2+]c transiently in 6 hr, then declined gradually to a basal level in 24 hr. Knocking down the expression levels of ZnT1 (mostly at the plasma membrane) and ZIP8 (present in endosomes and lysosomes) increased and decreased the ZnO-NP-induced elevation of [Zn2+]c, respectively. ZnO-NP treatment reduced the basal levels of reactive oxygen species and Bax/Bcl-2 mRNA ratios; in addition, ZnO-NP decreased the 6-OHDA-induced ROS production, p53 expression, and cell death. Therefore, mild elevations in [Zn2+]c induced by ZnO-NP activate beneficial effects in reducing the 6-OHDA-induced cytotoxic effects. Therefore, brain-delivery of ZnO-NP can be regarded as a potential therapy for neurological disease.",

The animals from the EP-A14, EP-A25 and EP-A36 groups were subjected to different concentrations of alcohol 30 days before EP induction. The histological characteristics, percentage of bone in the furcation (PBF) and bone metabolism in the furcation region were evaluated. The PBF and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) data were subjected to statistical analysis.Results The EP-A14, EP-A25 and EP-A36 groups had lower PBFs compared with the EP-NT group. A more severe inflammatory process and a greater number of TRAP+ cells were also observed. In the EP-A14, EP-A25 and EP-A36 groups, the inflammatory process became more severe as the ingested alcoholic concentration increased. An increase in RANKL immunostaining and a significantly higher number of TRAP+ cells were also observed.Conclusion We conclude that chronic alcohol consumption increases the severity of experimental periodontitis in a dose-dependent manner by increasing the magnitude of local inflammatory responses and stimulating alveolar bone resorption.View Full Text",
