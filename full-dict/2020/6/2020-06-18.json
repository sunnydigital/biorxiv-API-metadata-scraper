    "abstract": "Mice possess two types of teeth that differ in their cusp patterns; incisors have one cusp and molars have multiple cusps. The patterning of these two types of teeth relies on fine-tuning of the reciprocal molecular signaling between dental epithelial and mesenchymal tissues during embryonic development. Here we show that the incisors are populated only at early time points by the neural crest, whereas the molars continue to receive contributions at later stages, revealing a temporal difference that could alter epithelial-mesenchymal signaling dynamics between these two types of teeth. The AP-2 transcription factors, particularly Tfap2a and Tfap2b, are essential components of such epithelial-mesenchymal signaling interactions that coordinate craniofacial development in mice and other mammals, but little is known about their roles in the regulation of tooth development and shape. We demonstrate that incisors and molars differ in their temporal and spatial expression of Tfap2a and Tfap2b; in particular, at the bud stage, Tfap2a is expressed in both the epithelium and mesenchyme of the incisors and molars but expression of Tfap2b is restricted to the mesenchyme of the molars. Tissue-specific deletions show that loss of the epithelial domain of Tfap2a and Tfap2b affects the number and spatial arrangement of the incisors, notably resulting in duplicated lower incisors. In contrast, deletion of these two genes in the mesenchymal domain has little effect on tooth development. Collectively these results implicate epithelial expression of Tfap2a and Tfap2b in dorsal-ventral patterning of the incisors and suggest that these genes contribute to morphological differences between anterior (incisor) and posterior (molar) teeth within the mammalian dentition.\n\nHighlightsO_LILate-migrating cranial neural crest cells contribute extensively to the developing molar tooth germs but minimally to the incisors.\nC_LIO_LIDuring tooth development, transcription factors Tfap2a and Tfap2b are expressed in spatially and temporally dynamic patterns and differ between incisor and molar tooth germs.\nC_LIO_LIEpithelial expression of Tfap2a and Tfap2b is necessary for incisor development, but mesenchymal expression of these genes is not required.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Metabarcoding of Metazoa using mitochondrial genes may be confounded by both the accumulation of PCR and sequencing artefacts and the co-amplification of nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes (NUMTs). The application of read abundance thresholds and denoising methods is efficient in reducing noise accompanying authentic mitochondrial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). However, these procedures do not fully account for the complex nature of concomitant sequences and the highly variable DNA contribution of individuals in a metabarcoding sample. We propose, as a complement to denoising, the metabarcoding Multidimensional Abundance Threshold Evaluation (metaMATE) framework, a novel approach that allows comprehensive examination of multiple dimensions of abundance filtering and the evaluation of the prevalence of unwanted concomitant sequences in denoised metabarcoding datasets. metaMATE requires a denoised set of ASVs as input, and designates a subset of ASVs as being either authentic (mtDNA haplotypes) or non-authentic ASVs (NUMTs and erroneous sequences) by comparison to external reference data and by analysing nucleotide substitution patterns. metaMATE (i) facilitates the application of read abundance filtering strategies, which are structured with regard to sequence library and phylogeny and applied for a range of increasing abundance threshold values, and (ii) evaluates their performance by quantifying the prevalence of non-authentic ASVs and the collateral effects on the removal of authentic ASVs. The output from metaMATE facilitates decision-making about required filtering stringency and can be used to improve the reliability of intraspecific genetic information derived from metabarcode data. The framework is implemented in the metaMATE software, available at https://github.com/tjcreedy/metamate).",

    "abstract": "Metabolism across all known living systems combines two key features. First, all of the molecules that are required are either available in the environment or can be built up from available resources via other reactions within the system. Second, the reactions proceed in a fast and synchronised fashion via catalysts that are also produced within the system. Building on early work by Stuart Kauffman, a precise mathematical model for describing such self-sustaining autocatalytic systems (RAF theory) has been developed to explore the origins and organisation of living systems within a general formal framework. In this paper, we develop this theory further by establishing new relationships between classes of RAFs and related classes of networks, and developing new algorithms to investigate and visualise RAF structures in detail. We illustrate our results by showing how it reveals further details into the structure of archaeal and bacterial metabolism near the origin of life, and provide techniques to study and visualise the core aspects of primitive biochemistry.",

    "abstract": "We present a chromosome-level, long-read genome assembly as a reference for northern pike (Esox lucius) where 97.5% of the genome is chromosome-anchored and N50 falls at 37.5 Mb. Whole-genome resequencing was genotyped using this assembly for 47 northern pike representing six North American populations from Alaska to New Jersey. We discovered that a disproportionate frequency of genetic polymorphism exists among populations east and west of the North American Continental Divide (NACD), indicating reproductive isolation across this barrier. Genome-wide analysis of heterozygous SNP density revealed a remarkable lack of genetic variation with 1 polymorphic site every 6.3kb in the Yukon River drainage and one every 16.5kb east of the NACD. Observed heterozygosity (Ho), nucleotide diversity ({pi}), and Tajimas D are depressed in populations east of the NACD (east vs. west: Ho: 0.092 vs 0.31; {pi}: 0.092 vs 0.28; Tajimas D: -1.61 vs -0.47). We confirm the presence of the master sex determining (MSD) gene, amhby, in the Yukon River drainage and in an invasive population in British Columbia and confirm its absence in populations east of the NACD. We also describe an Alaskan population where amhby is present but not associated with male gender determination. Our results support that northern pike originally colonized North America through Beringia, that Alaska provided an unglaciated refugium for northern pike during the last ice age, and southeast of the NACD was colonized by a small founding population(s) that lost amhby.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells are differentially dependent on the splicing machinery compared to normal untransformed cells. The splicing machinery thus represents a potential therapeutic target in cancer. To identify splicing factors important for prostate cancer cell (PCa) cell growth, we performed a parallel pooled shRNA screen on in vitro passaged cells and in vivo xenografted PCa tumor lines. Our screen revealed HNRNPM as a potential regulator of PCa cell growth. RNA- and eCLIP-sequencing data suggest that HNRNPM is bound to transcripts of key homeostatic genes and that loss of HNRNPM binding in a subset of these genes results in aberrant exon inclusion and exon back-splicing events in target transcripts. In both linear and circular mis-spliced transcripts, HNRNPM appears to preferentially bind to GU-rich elements in long flanking proximal introns. Mimicry of HNRNPM dependent linear splicing events using splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides (SSOs) was sufficient to inhibit cell growth in HNRNPM expressing cells. This suggests that prostate cancer cell dependence on HNRNPM is likely a result of mis-splicing of key homeostatic coding and non-coding genes. Taken together, our data reveal a role for HNRNPM in supporting prostate cancer cell fitness, and also as a potential therapeutic target in PCa.",

    "abstract": "One of the defining pathological features of Alzheimers Disease (AD) is the deposition of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau in the brain. Aberrant activation of kinases in AD has been suggested to enhance phosphorylation and toxicity of tau, making the responsible tau-directed kinases attractive therapeutic targets. The full complement of tau interacting kinases in AD brain and their activity in disease remains incompletely defined. Here, immunoaffinity enrichment coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) identified TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) as a tau-interacting partner in human AD cortical brain tissues. We validated this interaction in both human AD and familial frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) caused by mutations in MAPT (R406W) postmortem brain tissues as well as human cell lines. Further, we document increased TBK1 activity in both AD and FTDP-17 and map the predominant TBK1 phosphorylation sites on tau based on in vitro kinase assays coupled to MS. Lastly, in a Drosophila tauopathy model, activating expression of a conserved TBK1 ortholog triggers tau hyperphosphorylation and enhanced neurodegeneration, whereas knockdown had the reciprocal effect, suppressing tau toxicity. Collectively, our findings suggest that increased TBK1 activity may promote tau hyperphosphorylation and neuronal loss in AD and related tauopathies.",

Importantly, molecular virulence strategies of distinct pathogens converge on a small set of regulators with central roles in plant immunity. The extent of convergence between pathogen and herbivorous insect virulence strategies is largely unexplored. We found that effectors from the oomycete pathogen, Phytophthora capsici, and the major aphid pest, Myzus persicae target the host immune regulator SIZ1, an E3 SUMO ligase. We show that the oomycete and aphid effector, which both contribute to virulence, feature different activities towards SIZ1. While M. persicae effector Mp64 increases SIZ1 protein levels, P. capsici effector CRN83_152 enhances SIZ1-E3 SUMO ligase activity in vivo. Loss of SIZ1 in host plants leads to reduced host susceptibility to aphids and an oomycete pathogen. Our results suggest convergence of distinct pathogen and pest virulence strategies on an E3 SUMO ligase to enhance host susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO) is a second messenger that regulates a broad range of physiological processes in plants. NO-derived molecules called reactive nitrogen species (RNS) can react with unsaturated fatty acids generating nitrated fatty acids (NO2-FA). NO2-FA work as signaling molecules in mammals where production and targets have been described under different stress conditions. Recently, NO2-FAs were detected in plants, however their role(s) on plant physiological processes is still poorly known. Here we show that exogenous application of nitro-oleic acid (NO2-OA) inhibits Arabidopsis primary root growth; this inhibition is not likely due to nitric oxide (NO) production or impaired auxin or cytokinin root responses. Deep analyses showed that roots incubated with NO2-OA had a lower cell number in the division area. Although this NO2-FA did not affect the signaling mechanisms maintaining the stem cell niche, plants incubated with NO2-OA showed a reduction of cell division in the meristematic area. Therefore, this work shows that NO2-OA inhibits mitotic processes subsequently reducing primary root growth.",

    "abstract": "Genetically identical individuals in bacterial populations can display significant phenotypic variability. This variability can be functional, for example by allowing a fraction of stress prepared cells to survive an otherwise lethal stress. The optimal fraction of stress prepared cells depends on environmental conditions. However, how bacterial populations modulate their level of phenotypic variability remains unclear. Here we show that the alternative sigma factor \u03c3V circuit in B. subtilis generates functional phenotypic variability that can be tuned by stress level, environmental history, and genetic perturbations. Using single-cell time-lapse microscopy and microfluidics, we find the fraction of cells that immediately activate \u03c3V under lysozyme stress depends on stress level and on a memory of previous stress. Iteration between model and experiment reveals that this tunability can be explained by the autoregulatory feedback structure of the sigV operon. As predicted by the model, genetic perturbations to the operon also modulate the response variability. The conserved sigma-anti-sigma autoregulation motif is thus a simple mechanism for bacterial populations to modulate their heterogeneity based on their environment.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "-Synuclein is a presynaptic protein that binds to cell membranes and is linked to Parkinsons disease (PD). Whilst the normal function of remains -synuclein remains uncertain, it is thought that oligomerization of the protein on the cell membrane contributes to cell damage. Knowledge of how -synuclein binds to lipid bilayers is therefore of great interest as a likely first step in the molecular pathophysiology of PD, and may provide insight of the phenotype of PD-promoting mutations. We use coarse-grained and atomistic simulations in conjunction with NMR and cross-linking mass spectrometry studies of -synuclein bound to anionic lipid bilayers to reveal a break in the helical structure of the NAC region, which may give rise to subsequent oligomer formation. Coarse-grained simulations of -synuclein show that the interhelical region leads recognition and binding to both POPG and mixed composition bilayers and identifies important protein-lipid contacts, including those in the region between the two helices in the folded structure. We extend these simulations with all-atom simulations of the initial binding event to reveal details of the time-progression of lipid binding. We present secondary structure analysis that reveals points of possible {beta}-strand formation in the structure, and investigate intramolecular contacts with simulations and mass-spectrometry crosslinking. Additionally we show how Markov state models can be used to investigate possible conformational changes of membrane bound -synuclein in the NAC region, and we extract representative structures. These structural insights will aid the design and development of novel therapeutic approaches.",

    "abstract": "Whiteflies (Hemiptera: Sternorrhyncha: Aleyrodidae) are a superfamily of small phloem-feeding insects. Their taxonomy is currently based on the morphology of nymphal stages that display phenotypic plasticity, which produces inconsistencies. To overcome this limitation, we developed a new phylogenetic framework that targets five genes of Candidatus Portiera aleyrodidarum, the primary endosymbiont of whiteflies. Portiera lineages have been co-diverging with whiteflies since their origin and therefore reflect their host evolutionary history. We also studied the origin of stability and instability in Portiera genomes by testing for the presence of two alternative gene rearrangements and the loss of a functional polymerase proofreading subunit (dnaQ), previously associated with genome instability. We present two phylogenetic reconstructions. One using the sequences of all five target genes from 22 whitefly species belonging to 17 genera. The second uses only two genes to include additional published Portiera sequences of 21 whitefly species, increasing our sampling size to 42 species from 25 genera. The developed framework showed low signal saturation, specificity to whitefly samples, and efficiency in solving inter-genera relationships and standing inconsistencies in the current taxonomy of the superfamily. Genome instability was found to be present only in the Aleurolobini tribe containing the Singhiella, Aleurolobus and Bemisia genera. This suggests that Portiera genome instability likely arose in the Aleurolobini tribes common ancestor, around 70 Mya. We propose a link between the switch from multi-bacteriocyte to a single-bacteriocyte mode of inheritance in the Aleurolobini tribe and the appearance of genome instability in Portiera.",

In addition, SPSS 22 software was used for statistics analysis and interpretation of associations among different studied parameters.\n\nResultsA total of 115 ethnomedicinal shrubs belonging to 50 families were reported to be used against different diseases. The study area was dominated by Fabaceae family (n=10). The RFC ranged from 0.02 (Deutzia scabra and Euonymus japonicus) to 0.85 (Rosa indica) while UV ranged from 0.01 (Cestrum diurnum and Garcinia aristata) to 0.23 (Jasminum grandiflorum and Hamelia patens) and RI ranged from 0.16 (Garcinia aristata) to 43.73 (Tabernaemontana divaricata). Moreover Lawsonia inermis, Piper nigrum, Punica granatum, Rosa indica and Vitis vinifera reported with 100% FL whereas maximum ICF were calculated by gastrointestinal diseases i.e., 0.45. On the basis of cluster analysis ethnomedicinal shrubs were categorized into two groups i.e., high valued and low valued. It was also found that most of the species in high valued group (n=29) were rare in study area due to their over exploitation. This study also documented 104 new use reports for ethnomedicinal shrubs.\n\nConclusionsThis study documented significant indigenous knowledge about ethnomedicinal shrubs used by the local people of District Lahore. This knowledge could be worthwhile in discovering and developing new plant-based drugs. Apart from this, current study also revealed that most valuable medicinal species are declining in their number due to over usage and mismanagement. Conservation strategies for medicinal plants of District Lahore are highly recommended.",
