    "abstract": "There is a great need for the development of vaccines for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we developed two modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) based vaccines which express either a membrane anchored full-length spike protein (MVA/S) stabilized in a prefusion state or the S1 region of the spike (MVA/S1) which forms trimers and is secreted. Both immunogens contained the receptor-binding domain (RBD) which is a known target of antibody-mediated neutralization. Following immunizations with MVA/S or MVA/S1, both spike protein recombinants induced strong IgG antibodies to purified full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The MVA/S induced a robust antibody response to purified RBD, S1 and S2 whereas MVA/S1 induced an antibody response to the S1 region outside of the RBD region. Both vaccines induced an antibody response in the lung and that was associated with induction of bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue. MVA/S but not MVA/S1 vaccinated mice generated robust neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 that strongly correlated with RBD antibody binding titers. Mechanistically, S1 binding to ACE-2 was strong but reduced following prolonged pre-incubation at room temperature suggesting confirmation changes in RBD with time. These results demonstrate MVA/S is a potential vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

Heavily glycosylated S trimers bind the ACE2 receptor and mediate entry of virions into target cells.

The structures and conformations of soluble, overexpressed, purified S proteins have been studied in detail using cryo-electron microscopy. The structure and distribution of S on the virion surface, however, has not been characterised. Here we applied cryo-electron microscopy and tomography to image intact SARS-CoV-2 virions, determining the high-resolution structure, conformational flexibility and distributions of S trimers in situ on the virion surface. These results provide a basis for understanding the conformations of S present on the virion, and for studying their interactions with neutralizing antibodies.",

    "abstract": "The novel coronavirus (nCOV-2019) outbreak has put the world on edge, causing millions of cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths all around the world, as of June 2020, let alone the societal and economic impacts of the crisis. The spike protein of nCOV-2019 resides on the virions surface mediating coronavirus entry into host cells by binding its receptor binding domain (RBD) to the host cell surface receptor protein, angiotensin converter enzyme (ACE2). Our goal is to provide a detailed structural mechanism of how nCOV-2019 recognizes and establishes contacts with ACE2 and its difference with an earlier coronavirus SARS-COV in 2002 via extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Numerous mutations have been identified in the RBD of nCOV-2019 strains isolated from humans in different parts of the world. In this study, we investigated the effect of these mutations as well as other Ala-scanning mutations on the stability of RBD/ACE2 complex. It is found that most of the naturally-occurring mutations to the RBD either strengthen or have the same binding affinity to ACE2 as the wild-type nCOV-2019. This may have implications for high human-to-human transmission of coronavirus in regions where these mutations have been found as well as any vaccine design endeavors since these mutations could act as antibody escape mutants. Furthermore, in-silico Ala-scanning and long-timescale MD simulations, highlight the crucial role of the residues at the interface of RBD and ACE2 that may be used as potential pharmacophores for any drug development endeavors. From an evolutional perspective, this study also identifies how the virus has evolved from its predecessor SARS-COV and how it could further evolve to become more infectious.",

    "abstract": "SummaryThe immune system plays a major role in the protection against cancer. Identifying and characterizing the pathways mediating this immune surveillance is thus critical for understanding how cancer cells are recognized and eliminated. We previously found that untransformed cells that had undergone senescence due to highly abnormal karyotypes are eliminated by Natural Killer (NK) cells in vitro. Here we show that this is also true for aneuploid untransformed cells that had not lost their ability to proliferate. Their elimination by NK cells, like that of aneuploid senescent cells, is predominantly mediated by non-cell autonomous mechanisms. Our data further indicate that NF-\u03baB signaling in aneuploid cells is central to eliciting this immune response. Inactivating NF-\u03baB abolishes NK-cell mediated clearance in aneuploid cells in vitro. In cancer cell lines, NF-\u03baB signaling correlates with degree of aneuploidy, raising the possibility that aneuploidy-induced immune recognition is partially retained in cancer.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Integration of a virus genome into human chromosomal DNA is critical in viral carcinogenesis. In this report, we discovered that virus-host fusion transcripts are characteristically originated mainly from a single integration site in three cervical cancer cell lines, CaSki and SiHa cells with multiple HPV16 DNA integration sites and HeLa cells with multiple HPV18 DNA integration sites. The host genomic elements surrounding the integrated HPV genome are critical for efficient expression of the viral oncogenes. We found that HPV E6 and E7 are expressed by hijacking a host 3\u2019 splice site and/or RNA polyadenylation signal for their production. The viral-host fusion transcripts may encode a chimeric viral-host fusion protein through alternative RNA splicing. One such E6* protein in SiHa cells was found to antagonize E6 function and knockdown of its expression further decreased p53 protein level and increased cell growth by promoting S phase entry. Together, our findings of the integrated virus genome expression only from a given integrated host genomic site will shed new light on possible application of precision medicine and the understanding of HPV carcinogenesis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Empirical evidence supports selection of soil microbial communities by edaphic properties across large spatial scales, however; less is known as smaller spatial scales (e.g 10s-100s of meters). The goal of this research was to evaluate the relationship between ecosystem characteristics and bacterial community structure/function in soils across small spatial scales in an urban preserve. We employed 16s rRNA gene sequencing, community level physiological profiling (CLPP), and soil chemical analysis to address this goal. We found no significant relationship between gradients in soil characteristics and community structure/function. In contrast, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Nitrospirae responded to variation in edaphic properties. Taxa exhibited a wide range in dispersal, supporting our finding of community wide differences in taxonomy. Furthermore, there was high metabolic diversity within the bacterial communities despite preferential metabolism of water-soluble polymers (Tween 40/80). Carbon substrate utilization patterns also suggest dominance of functional generalists. Pairwise comparison of carbon substrate utilization patterns indicates that there are high levels of microbial functional redundancy within soils across the sampling area. Lastly, we found that edaphic properties did not shape the overall community structure and/or function, and our analyses suggest that stochasticity may play a role in bacterial community assembly in soils with the local spatial scale of this research study.Graphical Abstract One Sentence Summary: Microorganisms at small spatial scales were functionally similar despite subtle differences in community composition.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The genus Flavobacterium is characterized by the capacity to metabolize complex organic compounds and a unique gliding motility mechanism. They are often abundant in root microbiomes of various plants, but the factors contributing to this high abundance are currently unknown. In this study, we evaluated the effect of various plant-associated poly- and mono-saccharides on colony expansion of two Flavobacterium strains. Both strains were able to spread on pectin and other polysaccharides such as microcrystalline cellulose. However, only pectin (but not pectin monomers), a component of plant cell walls, enhanced colony expansion on solid surfaces in a dose- and substrate-dependent manner. On pectin, flavobacteria exhibited bi-phasic motility, with an initial phase of rapid expansion, followed by growth within the colonized area. Proteomic and gene expression analyses revealed significant induction of carbohydrate metabolism related proteins when flavobacteria were grown on pectin, including selected SusC/D, TonB-dependent glycan transport operons. Our results show a positive correlation between colony expansion and the upregulation of proteins involved in sugar uptake, suggesting an unknown linkage between specific operons encoding for glycan uptake and metabolism and flavobacterial expansion. Furthermore, within the context of flavobacterial-plant interactions, they suggest that pectin may facilitate flavobacterial expansion on plant surfaces in addition to serving as an essential carbon source.\n\nContribution to the field statementMembers of the Flavobacterium genus are frequently rhizosphere competent, i.e. abundant and generally enriched on root surfaces relative to surrounding bulk soil, and previous studies suggest that they may play a role in plant health and ecosystem functioning. However, little is known about genetic and physiological factors that facilitate flavobacterial colonization and proliferation in this highly competitive environment.\n\nIn this study we found that pectin stimulates flavobacterial colonies in a bi-phasic manner, initially characterized by rapid expansion on agar followed by increased biomass production. This appears to be linked to pectin-stimulated induction of specific TonB-associated proteins evidentially involved in the binding and uptake of complex sugars. Given the fact that pectin and other glycans are a primary component of plant cell walls, we hypothesize that these mechanisms are at least partially responsible for the rhizosphere competence of flavobacteria.",

    "abstract": "Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an RNA-binding protein that regulates the translation of numerous mRNAs in neurons. The precise mechanism of translational regulation by FMRP is unknown. Some studies have indicated that FMRP inhibits the initiation step of translation, whereas other studies have indicated that the elongation step of translation is inhibited by FMRP. To determine whether FMRP inhibits the initiation or the elongation step of protein synthesis, we investigated m7G-cap-dependent and IRES-driven, cap-independent translation of several reporter mRNAs in vitro. Our results show that FMRP inhibits both m7G-cap-dependent and cap-independent translation to similar degrees, indicating that the elongation step of translation is inhibited by FMRP. Additionally, we dissected the RNA-binding domains of hFMRP to determine the essential domains for inhibiting translation. We show that the RGG domain, together with the C-terminal domain (CTD), is sufficient to inhibit translation while the KH domains do not inhibit mRNA translation. However, the region between the RGG domain and the KH2 domain may contribute as NT-hFMRP shows more potent inhibition than the RGG-CTD tail alone. Interestingly, we see a correlation between ribosome binding and translation inhibition, suggesting the RGG-CTD tail of hFMRP may anchor FMRP to the ribosome during translation inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Fruit colour, which is central to the sensorial and nutritional quality of the fruit, is a major breeding target in cultivated strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa). Red fruit colour is caused by the accumulation of anthocyanins, which are water-soluble flavonoids. Here, using pseudo F1 progeny derived from the cv.  Capitola and the advanced line  CF1116 and taking advantage of the available high density SNP array, we delineated fruit flavonoids mQTLs (13 compounds: anthocyanin, flavonols and flavan-3-ols) and colour-related QTLs (total anthocyanins and fruit colour) to narrow genomic regions corresponding to specific subgenomes of the cultivated strawberry. Findings showed that the overwhelming majority of the anthocyanin mQTLs and other colour-related QTLs are specific to F. vesca subgenome but that other subgenomes also contribute to colour variations. We then focused on two major homoeo-mQTLs for pelargonidin-3-glucoside (PgGs) localized on both male and female maps on linkage group LG3a (F. vesca subgenome). Combined high-resolution mapping of PgGs mQTLs and colour QTLs, transcriptome analysis of selected progeny individuals and whole genome sequencing of the parents led to the identification of several INDELS in the cis-regulatory region of a MYB102-like ODORANT gene and of the deletion of a putative MADS box binding motif in the 5UTR upstream region of an anthocyanidin reductase (ANR) gene, which likely underlie significant colour variations in strawberry fruit. The implications of these findings are important for the functional analysis and genetic engineering of colour-related genes and for the breeding by Marker-Assisted-Selection of new strawberry varieties with improved colour and health-benefits.",

    "abstract": "A growing body of data suggests that the microbiome of a species can vary considerably from individual to individual, but the reasons for this variation - and the consequences for the ecology of these communities - remain only partially explained. In mammals, the emerging picture is that the metabolic state and immune system status of the host affects the composition of the microbiome, but quantitative ecological microbiome studies are challenging to perform in higher organisms. Here we show that these phenomena can be quantitatively analyzed in the tractable nematode host Caenorhabditis elegans. Mutants in innate immunity, in particular the DAF-2/Insulin Growth Factor (IGF) pathway, are shown to contain a microbiome that differs from that of wild type nematodes. We analyze the underlying basis of these differences from the perspective of community ecology by comparing experimental observations to the predictions of a neutral sampling model and conclude that fundamental differences in microbiome ecology underlie the observed differences in microbiome composition. We test this hypothesis by introducing a minor perturbation to the colonization conditions, allowing us to assess stability of communities in different host strains. Our results show that altering host immunity changes the importance of inter-species interactions within the microbiome, resulting in differences in community composition and stability that emerge from these differences in host-microbe ecology.\n\nImportanceHere we use a Caenorhabditis elegans microbiome model to demonstrate how genetic differences in innate immunity alter microbiome composition, diversity, and stability by changing the ecological processes that shape these communities. These results provide insight into the role of host genetics in controlling the ecology of host-associated microbiota, resulting in differences in community composition, successional trajectories, and response to perturbation.",

RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR (RALF) peptides have recently emerged as important players in multiple physiological processes. Numerous studies on RALF peptides focused on broad phylogenetic analysis including multiple species. Thus, progress has been made in understanding the evolutionary processes that shaped this family. Nevertheless, to date, there is no comprehensive, family-wide functional study on RALF peptides. Here, we analysed the phylogeny and function of the proposed multigenic RALF peptide family in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, ecotype Col-0. Our phylogenetic analysis reveals that two of the previously proposed RALF peptides are not genuine RALF peptides, which leads us to propose a new consensus AtRALF peptide family annotation. Moreover, we show that the majority of AtRALF peptides are able to induce seedling or root growth inhibition in A. thaliana seedlings when applied exogenously as synthetic peptides. Additionally, we show that most of these responses are dependent on the Catharanthus roseus RLK1-LIKE receptor kinase FERONIA, suggesting a pivotal role in the perception of multiple RALF peptides.One sentence summary The majority of A. thaliana RALF peptides inhibit growth in a FERONIA-dependent mannerView Full Text",

    "abstract": "Monoterpenes are molecules with insecticide properties whose mechanism of action is however not completely elucidated. Furthermore, they seem to be able to modulate the monoaminergic system and several behavioural aspects in insects. In particular, tyramine (TA) and octopamine (OA) and their associated receptors orchestrate physiological processes such as feeding, locomotion and metabolism. Here we show that monoterpenes not only act as biopesticides in Drosophila species but can cause complex behavioural alterations that require a functional type 1 tyramine receptors (TAR1s). Variations in metabolic traits as well as locomotory activity were evaluated in both Drosophila suzukii and Drosophila melanogaster after treatment with three monoterpenes. A TAR1-/- D. melanogaster strain was used to better understand the relationships between the receptor and monoterpenes-related behavioural changes. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that, in the D. melanogaster brain, TAR1 appeared to be expressed in areas controlling metabolism. In comparison to the D. melanogaster wild type, the TAR-/- flies showed a phenotype characterized by higher triglyceride levels and food intake as well as lower locomotory activity. The monoterpenes, tested at sublethal concentrations, were able to induce a downregulation of the TAR1 coding gene in both Drosophila species. Furthermore, monoterpenes also altered the behaviour in D. suzukii and D. melanogaster wild types 24 h after a continuous monoterpene exposure. Interestingly, they were ineffective in modifying the physiological performances of TAR1-/- flies. In conclusion, it appears that monoterpenes not only act as biopesticides for Drosophila but they can also interfere with its behaviour and metabolism in a TAR1-dependent fashion.",

Here we develop a metalation-calculator which accounts for inter-metal competition and changing metal-availabilities inside cells. The calculations are based on available free-energies of metals determined from the responses of metal sensors. We use the calculator to understand the function and mechanism of CobW, a predicted CoII-chaperone for vitamin B12. CobW is calculated to acquire negligible metal alone: But, upon binding nucleotide (GTP) and MgII, CobW assembles a high-affinity site that can obtain CoII or ZnII from the intracellular milieu. In idealised cells with sensors at the mid-points of their responses, competition within the cytosol enables CoII to outcompete ZnII for binding CobW. Thus, CoII is the cognate metal. However, after growth in different [CoII], CoII-occupancy ranges from 10 to 97% which matches CobW-dependent B12 synthesis. The calculator reveals how CobW acquires its metal and is made available for use with other proteins.",

    "abstract": "The transcription factor NRL (Neural Retinal Leucine-zipper) has been canonized, appropriately enough, as the master regulator of photoreceptor cell fate in the retina. NRL is necessary and sufficient to specify rod cell fate and to preclude cone cell fate in mice. By engineering zebrafish we tested if NRL function has conserved roles beyond mammals or beyond nocturnal species, i.e. in a vertebrate possessing a greater and more typical diversity of cone sub-types. Here, transgenic expression of a Nrl homolog from zebrafish or mouse was sufficient to convert developing zebrafish cones into rod photoreceptors. Zebrafish nrl-/- mutants lacked rods (and had excess UV-sensitive cones) as young larvae, thus the conservation of Nrl function between mice and zebrafish appears sound. These data inform hypotheses of photoreceptor evolution through the Nocturnal Bottleneck, suggesting that a capacity to favor nocturnal vision is a property of NRL that predates the emergence of early mammals. Strikingly, however, rods were abundant in adult nrl-/- null mutant zebrafish. Rods developed in adults despite Nrl protein being undetectable. Therefore a yet-to-be-revealed non-canonical pathway independent of nrl is able to specify the fate of some rod photoreceptors.Highlights- Nrl is conserved and sufficient to specify rod photoreceptors in zebrafish retina- Nrl is necessary for rod photoreceptors in early ontogeny of zebrafish larvae- Zebrafish Nrl is functionally conserved with mouse and human NRL- Remarkably, Nrl is dispensable for rod specification in adult zebrafishCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms that confer these architectures remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigated the functional roles of H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2), one of the abundant histone modifications, in three-dimensional (3D) genome organization. Unlike mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), inhibition of methyltransferases G9a and GLP in differentiated cells eliminated H3K9me2 predominantly at A-type (active) genomic compartments, and the level of residual H3K9me2 modification was strongly associated with genomic compartments in differentiated cells. Furthermore, chemical inhibition of G9a/GLP in mouse hepatocytes led to the decreased chromatin-nuclear lamina interactions mainly at G9a/GLP sensitive regions (GSRs), the increased degree of genomic compartmentalization, and the up-regulation of hundreds of genes that were associated with alterations of the 3D chromatin. Collectively, our data demonstrated essential roles of H3K9me2 in 3D genome organization.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas spp. exhibit considerable differences in host specificity and virulence. Most Pseudomonas species were isolated exclusively from environmental sources, ranging from soil to plants, but some Pseudomonas species have been detected from versatile sources, including both human host and environmental sources. Understanding genome variations that generate the tremendous diversity in Pseudomonas biology is important in controlling the incidence of infections. With a data set of 704 Pseudomonas complete whole genome sequences representing 186 species, Pseudomonas intrageneric structure was investigated by hierarchical clustering based on average nucleotide identity, and by phylogeny analysis based on concatenated core-gene alignment. Further comparative functional analyses indicated that Pseudomonas species only living in natural habitats lack multiple functions that are important in the regulation of bacterial pathogenesis, indicating the possession of these functions might be characteristic of Pseudomonas human pathogens. Moreover, we have performed pangenome based homogeneity analyses, and detected genes with conserved structures but diversified functions across the Pseudomonas genomes, suggesting these genes play a role in driving diversity. In summary, this study provided insights into the dynamics of genome diversity and host-related genetic determinants in Pseudomonas, which might help the development of more targeted antibiotics for the treatment of Pseudomonas infections.",

The non-cell-specific inhibition of Tril in the arcuate nucleus resulted in reduced hypothalamic inflammation, protection against diet-induced obesity associated with increased whole-body energy expenditure and increased systemic glucose tolerance. The inhibition of Tril, specifically in POMC neurons, resulted in a trend for protection against diet-induced obesity, increased energy expenditure and increased hypothalamic sensitivity to leptin. Thus, Tril emerges as a new component of the complex mechanisms that promote hypothalamic dysfunction in experimental diet-induced obesity.",

Exogenous application of phytohormones has been shown to affect FHB resistance. In contrast to FHB, FRR remains poorly characterised and it is unknown whether phytohormones play similar roles in FHB and FRR. In this present study, B. distachyon floral tissues at mid-anthesis and root tissues from seedlings were exogenously treated with several phytohormones before inoculation with F. graminearum. The canonical defence-associated phytohormones had differing effects on FHB and FRR. Salicylic acid (SA) significantly increased susceptibility to FRR but not to FHB while jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene increased resistance to FRR but increased susceptibility to FHB. Additionally, the growth-associated phytohormones auxin and cytokinin significantly increased resistance and susceptibility, respectively, to both diseases.

    "abstract": "Regenerative repair of craniomaxillofacial bone injuries is challenging due to both the large size and irregular shape of many defects. Mineralized collagen scaffolds have previously been shown to be a promising biomaterial implant to accelerate craniofacial bone regeneration in vivo. Here we describe inclusion of a 3D-printed polymer or ceramic-based mesh into a mineralized collagen scaffold to improve mechanical and biological activity. Mineralized collagen scaffolds were reinforced with 3D-printed Fluffy-PLG (ultraporous polylactide-co-glycolide co-polymer) or Hyperelastic Bone (90wt% calcium phosphate in PLG) meshes. We show degradation byproducts and acidic release from the printed structures have limited negative impact on the viability of mesenchymal stem cells. Further, inclusion of a mesh formed from Hyperelastic Bone generates a reinforced composite with significantly improved mechanical performance (elastic modulus, push-out strength). Composites formed from the mineralized collagen scaffold and either Hyperelastic Bone or Fluffy-PLG reinforcement both supported human bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell osteogenesis and new bone formation. Strikingly, composites reinforced with Hyperelastic Bone mesh elicited significantly increased secretion of osteoprotegerin, a soluble glycoprotein and endogenous inhibitor of osteoclast activity. These results suggest that architectured meshes can be integrated into collagen scaffolds to boost mechanical performance and actively instruct cell processes that aid osteogenicity; specifically, secretion of a factor crucial to inhibiting osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Future work will focus on further adapting the polymer mesh architecture to confer improved shape-fitting capacity as well as to investigate the role of polymer reinforcement on MSC-osteoclast interactions as a means to increase regenerative potential.",

    "abstract": "Introgression is arguably one of the most important biological processes in the evolution of groups of related species, affecting at least 10% of the extant species in the animal kingdom. Introgression reduces genetic divergence between species, and in some cases can be highly beneficial, facilitating rapid adaptation to ever-changing environmental pressures. Introgression also significantly impacts inference of phylogenetic species relationships where a strictly binary tree model cannot adequately explain reticulate net-like species relationships. Here we use phylogenomic approaches to understand patterns of introgression along the evolutionary history of a unique, non-model insect system: dragonflies and damselflies (Odonata). We demonstrate that introgression is a pervasive evolutionary force across various taxonomic levels within Odonata. In particular, we show that the morphologically \"intermediate\" species of Anisozygoptera (one of the three primary suborders within Odonata besides Zygoptera and Anisoptera), which retain phenotypic characteristics of the other two suborders, experienced high levels of introgression likely coming from zygopteran genomes. Additionally, we found evidence for multiple cases of deep inter-superfamilial ancestral introgression.",

    "abstract": "Helicobacter pylori (Hp) CagA protein has a key role in the development of gastric cancer by the intruding in many intracellular processes of host human cell. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is an essential process for cellular homeostasis that modulates survival and death and is linked to several complex diseases including cancer. CagA protein is found in the serum of Hp-positive individuals and also in the supernatant of Hp culture. Limited studies report that recombinant CagA can alter gene expression and signaling pathways and induce the death of human cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of exogenous recombinant CagA protein treatment on ER stress and autophagy of human cell. AGS, MKN45, and HEK293 cells were treated with 1 {micro}g/ml of recombinant CagA protein and then ER stress was studied by quantitative-PCR of spliced XBP-1 mRNA, immunofluorescence staining of ATF6 protein nuclear localization and real-time quantitative-PCR and/or western blot expression of GRP78, GRP94, ATF4 and CHOP genes. Autophagy was studied by western blot assessment of the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and LC3 aggregation. Cell proliferation and death were investigated by MTT assay and trypan blue staining respectively. As result, treatment with recombinant CagA enhanced XBP-1mRNA splicing, nuclear localization of ATF6, and the expression of ER stress signaling target genes in the cells. Recombinant CagA also induced LC3 protein conversion and aggregation in the cells. Reduced cell proliferation and increased cell death were determined in the cells treated with recombinant CagA. These results show that exogenous recombinant CagA protein causes cell death by inducing ER stress and autophagy in human cells. We conclude that CagA protein exogenously localizes in/on human cells and induces ER stress via disturbing protein machinery leading the human cell to death, however, the mechanism of CagA-host cell interaction is to be investigated.",

    "abstract": "Affective behaviors and mental health are profoundly affected by disturbances in circadian rhythms. Casein kinase 1 epsilon (CSNK1E) is an essential component of the core circadian clock. Mice with tau or null mutation of this gene have shortened and lengthened circadian period respectively. Here we examined anxiety-like, fear, and depressive-like behaviors in both male and female mice of these two different mutants. Compared with wild-type mice, we found reductions in fear and anxiety-like behaviors in both mutant lines and in both sexes, with the tau mutants exhibiting the greatest phenotypic changes. However, the depressive-like behaviors had distinct phenotypic patterns, with markedly less depressive-like behaviors in female null mutants, but not in tau mutants of either sex. To determine whether abnormal light entrainment of tau mutants to 24 hour light-dark cycles contributes to these phenotypic differences, we also examined these behaviors in tau mutants on a 20 hour light-dark cycle close to their endogenous circadian period. The normalized entrainment restored more wild-type-like behaviors for fear and anxiety, but it induced depressive-like behavior in tau mutant females. These data show that both mutations of Csnk1e broadly affect fear and anxiety-like behaviors, while the effects on depressive-like behavior vary with genetics, photoperiod, and sex, suggesting that the mechanisms by which Csnk1e affects fear and anxiety-like behaviors may be similar, but distinct from those affecting depressive-like behavior. Our study also provides experimental evidence in support of the hypothesis of beneficial outcomes from properly entrained circadian rhythms in terms of the anxiety-like and fear behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells have been used in disease modelling and transplantation studies in retinal diseases. Several types of RPE cells have been trialed, ranging from primary cells and immortalized cell lines to stem cell-derived RPE cells. During aging and in disease, the extracellular environment of the RPE cells changes, interfering with RPE cell adhesion. We hypothesize that this could be a key problem in transplantation studies that have reported lack of adhesion and survival of the transplanted RPE cells. Integrins are essential for the proper function of the RPE, mediating adhesion to Bruchs membrane, and the binding and subsequent phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments. Variability that has been found in clinical trials might be due to the variability of cell types used and their expression profiles of surface molecules. Here, we set out to analyze integrin expression in primary rat RPE cells and in the human cell line ARPE-19 using immunochemistry. We found that both cell types express integrins to varying degrees. After long-term culturing, ARPE-19 cells resemble mature RPE cells, and increase integrin expression. We hence argue that it is important to test the properties of these cells prior to transplantation to avoid failure of adhesion and to facilitate correct function.",

We analyzed the full-length isoform transcriptome of the developing human brain and observed differentially expressed isoforms and isoform co-expression modules undetectable by gene-level analyses.

Given that most biological processes are temperature sensitive, it is remarkable that the neuronal circuits of poikilothermic animals can maintain coupling across a wide range of temperatures. Within the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the crab, Cancer borealis, the fast pyloric rhythm (~1Hz) and the slow gastric mill rhythm (~0.1Hz) are precisely coordinated at ~11{degrees}C such that there is an integer number of pyloric cycles per gastric mill cycle (integer coupling). Upon increasing temperature from 7-23{degrees}C, both oscillators showed similar temperature-dependent increases in cycle frequency, and integer coupling between the circuits was conserved. Thus, although both rhythms show temperature dependent changes in rhythm frequency, the processes that couple these circuits maintain their coordination over a wide range of temperature. Such robustness to temperature changes could be part of a toolbox of processes that enables neural circuits to maintain function despite global perturbations.",

Similar to ThT, ASCP is fluorogenic in the presence of amyloid fibrils and upon binding and excitation at 460 nm produces a red-shifted emission with a large Stokes shift of 145 nm. ASCP has a higher binding affinity to fibrillar \u03b1-synuclein than ThT and likely shares the same binding sites to amyloid fibrils. Importantly, ASCP was found to also be fluorogenic in the presence of amorphous aggregates and can detect oligomeric species formed early during aggregation. Moreover, ASCP can be used to visualise fibrils via Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and, due to its large Stokes shift, simultaneously monitor the fluorescence emission of other labelled proteins following excitation with the same laser used to excite ASCP. Consequently, ASCP possesses enhanced and unique spectral characteristics compared to ThT that make it a promising alternative for the in vitro study of amyloid fibrils and the mechanisms by which they form.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "SUMMARYRostro-caudal patterning of vertebrates depends on the temporally progressive activation of HOX genes within axial stem cells that fuel axial embryo elongation. Whether HOX genes sequential activation, the \u201cHOX clock\u201d, is paced by intrinsic chromatin-based timing mechanisms or by temporal changes in extrinsic cues remains unclear. Here, we studied HOX clock pacing in human pluripotent stem cells differentiating into spinal cord motor neuron subtypes which are progenies of axial progenitors. We show that the progressive activation of caudal HOX genes in axial progenitors is controlled by a dynamic increase in FGF signaling. Blocking FGF pathway stalled induction of HOX genes, while precocious increase in FGF alone, or with GDF11 ligand, accelerated the HOX clock. Cells differentiated under accelerated HOX induction generated appropriate posterior motor neuron subtypes found along the human embryonic spinal cord. The HOX clock is thus dynamically paced by exposure parameters to secreted cues. Its manipulation by extrinsic factors alleviates temporal requirements to provide unprecedented synchronized access to human cells of multiple, defined, rostro-caudal identities for basic and translational applications.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "While the early stages of biofilm formation have been well characterized, less is known about the requirements for Pseudomonas aeruginosa to maintain a mature biofilm. We utilized a P. aeruginosa-phage interaction to find that rmcA and morA, two genes which encode for c-di-GMP-degrading phosphodiesterase (PDEs) enzymes, are important for the regulation of biofilm maintenance. Deletion of these genes initially results in an elevated biofilm phenotype characterized by increased production of c-di-GMP, Pel polysaccharide and biofilm biomass. In contrast to the wild-type strain, these mutants were unable to maintain the biofilm when exposed to carbon-limited conditions. The susceptibility to nutrient limitation, and subsequent loss of biofilm viability of these mutants, was phenotypically reproduced with a stringent response mutant ({Delta}relA {Delta}spoT), indicating that the {Delta}rmcA and {Delta}morA mutants may be unable to appropriately respond to nutrient limitation. Genetic and biochemical data indicate that RmcA and MorA physically interact with the Pel biosynthesis machinery, supporting a model whereby unregulated Pel biosynthesis contributes to the death of the {Delta}rmcA and {Delta}morA mutant strains in an established biofilm when nutrient-limited. These findings provide evidence that c-di-GMP-mediated regulation is required for mature biofilms of P. aeruginosa to effectively respond to changing availability of nutrients. Furthermore, the PDEs involved in biofilm maintenance are distinct from those required for establishing a biofilm, thus indicating that a wide variety of c-di-GMP metabolizing enzymes in organisms like P. aeruginosa likely allows for discrete control over the formation, maintenance or dispersion of biofilms.\n\nImportanceRecent advances in our understanding of c-di-GMP signaling have provided key insights into the regulation of biofilms. Despite an improved understanding of how they initially form, the processes that facilitate the long-term maintenance of these multicellular communities remain opaque. We found that P. aeruginosa requires two phosphodiesterases, RmcA and MorA, to maintain a mature biofilm and that P. aeruginosa biofilms lacking these PDEs succumb to nutrient limitation and die. The biofilm maintenance deficiency observed in {Delta}rmcA and {Delta}morA mutants was also found in the stringent response defective {Delta}relA {Delta}spoT strain, suggesting that a regulatory intersection between c-di-GMP signaling, EPS biosynthesis and the nutrient limitation response is important for persistent surface growth. We uncover components of an important regulatory system needed for P. aeruginosa to persist in nutrient-poor conditions, and provide some of the first evidence that maintaining a mature biofilm is an active process.",

    "abstract": "Somatodendritic missorting of the axonal protein TAU is a hallmark of Alzheimers disease and related tauopathies. Cultured rodent primary neurons and iPSC-derived neurons are used for studying mechanisms of neuronal polarity, including TAU trafficking. However, these models are expensive, time-consuming and/or require the sacrification of animals. In this study, we evaluated four differentiation procedures to generate mature neuron cultures from human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, in comparison to mouse primary neurons, and tested their TAU sorting capacity. We show that SH-SY5Y-derived neurons, differentiated with sequential RA/BDNF treatment, are suitable for investigating axonal TAU sorting. These human neurons show pronounced neuronal polarity, axodendritic outgrowth, expression of the neuronal maturation markers TAU and MAP2, and, importantly, efficient axonal sorting of endogenous and transfected human wild type TAU, similar to primary neurons. We demonstrate that axonal TAU enrichment requires the presence of the C-terminal half, as a C-terminus-lacking construct (N-term-TAUHA) is not axonally enriched in both neuronal cell models. Moreover, SH-SY5Y-derived neurons do not show formation of a classical axon initial segment (AIS), indicated by the lack of Ankyrin G (ANKG) and tripartite motif-containing protein 46 (TRIM46) at the proximal axon, which suggests that successful axonal TAU sorting is independent of classical AIS formation. Taken together, our results suggest i) that SH-SY5Y-derived neurons are a valuable human neuronal cell model for studying TAU sorting, which is readily accessible at low cost and without animal need, and that ii) the mechanisms of axonal TAU targeting require the TAU C-terminal half but are independent of ANKG or TRIM46 enrichment at the proximal axon.",

    "abstract": "Brown adipose tissue (BAT) functions in energy expenditure in part due its role in thermoregulation. The prominent capacity of BAT to enhance fuel utilization and energy expenditure makes it an attractive target for treating obesity and metabolic disorders. Prolonged cold exposure induces de novo recruitment of brown adipocytes and activates their thermogenic activity. However, the exact source of cold-induced brown adipocytes is not completely understood. In this study, we sought to investigate the cellular origin of cold-induced brown adipocytes using single-cell RNA sequencing. We identified two distinct types of adipocyte progenitors that contribute to de novo recruitment of brown adipocytes in response to cold challenge. One is the previously known Pdgfra-expressing mesenchymal progenitors and the other is a vascular smooth muscle-derived adipocyte progenitor (VSM-APC) population, which expresses the temperature-sensitive ion channel transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (Trpv1). Using flow cytometry and lineage tracing, we demonstrated that the Trpv1pos VSM-APCs were indeed distinct from the Pdgfrapos progenitors and could contribute to brown adipocytes with greater thermogenic potential. Together, these findings illustrate a landscape of thermogenic adipose niche at the single cell resolution and identify a new cellular origin for the development of brown adipocytes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The respiratory electron transport complexes convey electrons from nutrients to oxygen and generate a proton-motive force used for energy (ATP) production in cells. These enzymes are conserved among organisms, and organized as individual complexes or combined forming large super-complexes (SC). Bacterial electron transport pathways are more branched than those of mitochondria and contain multiple variants of such complexes depending on their growth modes. The Gram-negative species deploy a mitochondrial-like cytochrome bc1 (Complex III, CIII2), and may have bacteria-specific cbb3-type cytochrome c oxidases (Complex IV, CIV) in addition to, or instead of, the canonical aa3-type CIV. Electron transfer between these complexes is mediated by two different carriers: the soluble cytochrome c2 which is similar to mitochondrial cytochrome c and the membrane-anchored cytochrome cy which is unique to bacteria. Here, we report the first cryo-EM structure of a respiratory bc1-cbb3 type SC (CIII2CIV, 5.2\u00c5 resolution) and several conformers of native CIII2 (3.3\u00c5 resolution) from the Gram-negative bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus. The SC contains all catalytic subunits and cofactors of CIII2 and CIV, as well as two extra transmembrane helices attributed to cytochrome cy and the assembly factor CcoH. Remarkably, some of the native CIII2 are structural heterodimers with different conformations of their [2Fe-2S] cluster-bearing domains. The unresolved cytochrome c domain of cy suggests that it is mobile, and it interacts with CIII2CIV differently than cytochrome c2. Distance requirements for electron transfer suggest that cytochrome cy and cytochrome c2 donate electrons to heme cp1 and heme cp2 of CIV, respectively. For the first time, the CIII2CIV architecture and its electronic connections establish the structural features of two separate respiratory electron transport pathways (membrane-confined and membrane-external) between its partners in Gram-negative bacteria.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.AbbreviationsQquinoneQH2Quinol or hydroquinoneComplex IIICIII2 or cytochromebc1ubiquinolcytochrome c oxidoreductaseComplex IV or CIVcbb3-type cytochrome c oxidasecytcytochromecyt c2cytochrome c2, soluble cytochrome ccyt cycytochrome cy, membrane-anchored cytochrome ccyt S-cysoluble part of cytochrome cy without its membrane anchorSCsuper-complexMSmass spectrometryXL-MScross-linking mass spectrometryXLcross-linksTMBZ3,3\u2019,5,5\u2019-tetramethyl-benzidineDBH22,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-decyl-1,4-benzoquinoneFeSRieske iron-sulfur proteinFeS-EDmembrane-extrinsic domain of FeS proteinb positionlocation of the [2Fe-2S] cluster near heme bLc positionlocation of the [2Fe-2S] cluster near heme c1cryo-EMcryogenic electron microscopyBN-PAGEblue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresisSDS-PAGEsodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresisC-terC-terminusN-terN-terminusHis-tag8-histidine tagFLAG-tagDYKDDDDK-tagSECsize exclusion chromatographyTMHtransmembrane helixDSSdisuccinimidyl suberateDSBUdisuccinimidyl dibutyric urea; DMTMM, 4-(4,6-dimethoxy-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-4-methyl-morpholinium chlorideheme-Feheme-ironEmredox midpoint potentialheme cp1N-ter located c-type heme 1 of CcoPheme cp2C-ter located c-type heme 2 of CcoPheme coc-type heme of CcoOSO32-sulfiteSO42-sulfateRMSDroot-mean-square deviationDDMn-dodecyl \u03b2-D-maltoside.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Purpose I kappa B-interacting protein (IKBIP) in cancer has rarely been reported. This study aimed at investigating its expression pattern and biological function in brain glioma at transcriptional level.Methods We selected 301 glioma patients with microarray data from CGGA database and 697 glioma patients with RNAseq data from TCGA database. Transcriptome data and clinical data of 998 samples were analyzed. Statistical analysis and figure generating were performed with R language.Results We found that IKBIP expression showed positive correlation with WHO grade of glioma. IKBIP was increased in IDH wildtype and mesenchymal molecular subtype of glioma. Gene ontology analysis demonstrated that IKBIP was profoundly associated with extracellular matrix organization, cell-substrate adhesion and response to wounding in both pan-glioma and glioblastoma. Subsequent GSEA analysis revealed that IKBIP was particularly correlated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). To further elucidate the relationship between IKBIP and EMT, we performed GSVA analysis to screen the EMT-related signaling pathways, and found that IKBIP expression was significantly associated with PI3K/AKT, hypoxia and TGF-\u03b2 pathway. Moreover, IKBIP expression was found to be synergistic with key biomarkers of EMT, especially with N-cadherin, vimentin, snail, slug and TWIST1. Finally, higher IKBIP indicated significantly shorter survival for glioma patients.Conclusions IKBIP was associated with more aggressive phenotypes of gliomas.Furthermore, IKBIP was significantly involved in EMT and could serve as an independent prognosticator in glioma.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

We demonstrate the first simulated speckle contrast image and compare it against experimental results. We simulate three mouse-specific cerebral cortex decorrelation time images and implement three different schemes for analyzing the effects of homogenization of vascular structure on correlation decay times. Our results indicate that dissolving structure and assuming homogeneous geometry creates up to \u223c 10x shift in the correlation function decay times and alters its form compared with the case for which the exact geometry is simulated. These effects are more pronounced for point illumination and detection imaging schemes. Further analysis indicates that correlated multiple scattering events, on average, account for 50% of all dynamic scattering events for a detector over a vessel region and 31% that of a detector over parenchyma region, highlighting the significance of accurate modeling of the three-dimensional vascular geometry for accurate blood flow estimates.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "MicroRNA families are pervasive in the human transcriptome, but specific targeting of individual members is a challenge because of sequence homology. Many of the secondary structures of the precursors to these miRs (pre-miRs), however, are quite different. Here, we demonstrate both in vitro and in cellulis that design of structure-specific small molecules can inhibit specific miR family members to modulate a disease pathway. In particular, the miR-200 family consists five miRs, miR-200a, \u2212200b, \u2212200c, \u2212141, and - 429, and is associated with Type II Diabetes (T2D). We designed a small molecule that potently and selectively targets pre-miR-200c\u2019s structure. The compound reverses a pro-apoptotic effect in a pancreatic \u03b2-cell model. In contrast, oligonucleotides targeting the RNA\u2019s sequence inhibit all family members. Global proteomics analysis further demonstrates selectivity for miR-200c. Collectively, these studies establish that miR-200c plays an important role in T2D and that small molecules targeting RNA structure can be an important complement to oligonucleotides targeting sequence.Significance Statement The most common way to develop medicines targeting RNA is by using oligonucleotides that target its sequence by using base pairing. Some RNAs, however, have similar sequences and thus are impossible to target selectively by using oligonucleotides. Here, we show that a class of RNAs that have similar sequences emerge from precursors that have very different structures. Exploiting these structural differences afforded a selective compound. In particular, the selective small molecule targets a member of the microRNA (miR)-200 family, the overexpression of which is linked to diabetes and pancreatic cell death. Selective inhibition of family member miR-200c alleviates pancreatic cell death, and thus the small molecule provides a path to the treatment of diabetes.Competing Interest StatementMDD is a founder of expansion therapeuticsView Full Text",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTRetrotransposons are genomic DNA sequences that are capable of copying themselves to new genomic locations via RNA intermediates; LINE-1 is the only retrotransposon that remains autonomous and active in the human genome. The mobility of LINE-1 is largely repressed in somatic tissues, but LINE-1 is active in many cancers. Recent studies using LINE-1 constructs indicate that host cells activate a DNA damage response (DDR) to repair retrotransposition intermediates and resolve conflicts between LINE-1 and DNA replication. Using multi-omic data from the CPTAC project, we found correlations between LINE-1 expression and ATM-MRN-SMC DDR signalling in endometrial cancer and between LINE-1 and the ATR-CHEK1 pathway in p53 wild type breast cancer. This provides evidence that conflicts between LINE-1 and DNA replication occur in at least some human cancers. Furthermore, LINE-1 expression in these cancers is correlated with the total amount of copy number variation genome wide, indicating that, when active in cancer, pointing to a direct impact of LINE-1 associated DNA damage on genome structure. We also find that, in endometrial and ovarian cancer, LINE-1 expression is correlated with the expression of genes that drive cycle progression including E2F3, PLK1 and Aurora kinase B. This study provides evidence, supporting recent work in model cell lines, of a LINE-1/DDR connection in human tumors and raises the possibility of additional interactions between LINE-1 and the cell cycle.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

Here, we report that the spontaneous HCC development subsequent to the deletion of both Farnesoid X Receptor and Small Heterodimer Partner (DKO) mimics the sex-specific incidence seen clinically. In female DKO mice, we find lower levels of circulating bile acids (BA) and show that BAs can co-opt the estrogen axis to auto-regulate their homeostasis and amino acid metabolism. These regulations are lost when female mice are ovariectomized. Conversely, increasing serum BA levels is sufficient to promote tumorigenesis in female livers. To examine the translational relevance, we mined the transcriptomic signatures corresponding to that of female mice and found that it correlated well with those of low-grade tumors and associated with better outcomes for HCC patients. We demonstrate that decreasing enterohepatic recirculation of BAs using a resin dramatically reduced the liver cancer burden in male mice. These results uncover that sexual dimorphism in liver cancer incidence is linked to sex-differences in the handling of circulating BA concentrations and that lowering it might alleviate liver cancer.Significance We demonstrate that serum BA concentration facilitates sex-differences in tumor burden, with reduced BA levels resulting in lower HCC risk in female mice. Increasing or decreasing circulating BA levels, promotes or alleviates HCC risk, respectively. We show that the sex-specific gene profiles identified in the DKO mice model of HCC correlate directly with patient outcomes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Leucocytes often perform trogocytosis, the process by which cells acquire parts of the plasma membrane from interacting cells. Accumulating evidence indicates that trogocytosis modulates immune responses, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. Here, using two mouse models of leukemia, we found that cytotoxic lymphocytes perform trogocytosis at high rates with tumor cells. While performing trogocytosis, both Natural Killer and CD8+ T cells acquire the checkpoint receptor PD-1 from leukemia cells. In vitro and in vivo investigation revealed that PD-1 protein found on the surface of Natural Killer cells, rather than being endogenously expressed, was derived entirely from leukemia cells. Mechanistically, SLAM receptors were essential for PD-1 trogocytosis. PD-1 acquired via trogocytosis actively suppressed anti-tumor immunity, as revealed by the positive outcome of PD-1 blockade in PD-1-deficient mice. PD-1 trogocytosis was corroborated in patients with clonal plasma cell disorders, where Natural Killer cells that stained for PD-1 also stained for tumor cell markers. Our results, in addition to shedding light on a previously unappreciated mechanism underlying the presence of PD-1 on Natural Killer and cytotoxic T cells, reveal the immune-regulatory effect of membrane transfer occurring when immune cells contact tumor cells.\n\nOnce sentence summaryNatural Killer cells are inhibited by PD-1 acquired from the surface of tumor cells via trogocytosis.",

    "abstract": "NLRP1 and CARD8 are related cytosolic sensors that upon activation form supramolecular signalling complexes known as canonical inflammasomes, resulting in caspase-1 activation, cytokine maturation and/or pyroptotic cell death. NLRP1 and CARD8 use their C-terminal (CT) fragments containing a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) and the UPA subdomain of a function-to-find domain (FIIND) for self-oligomerization and recruitment of the inflammasome adaptor ASC and/or caspase-1. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of NLRP1-CT and CARD8-CT assemblies, in which the respective CARDs form central helical filaments that are promoted by oligomerized, but flexibly linked UPAs surrounding the filaments. We discover that subunits in the central NLRP1CARD filament dimerize with additional exterior CARDs, which roughly doubles its thickness and is unique among all known CARD filaments. The thick NLRP1 filament only forms with the presence of UPA, which we hypothesize drives the intrinsic propensity for NLRP1CARD dimerization. Structural analyses provide insights on the requirement of ASC for NLRP1-CT signalling and the contrasting direct recruitment of caspase-1 by CARD8-CT. Additionally, we present a low-resolution 4 ASCCARD\u20134 caspase-1CARD octamer structure, illustrating that ASC uses opposing surfaces for NLRP1, versus caspase-1, recruitment. These structures capture the architecture and specificity of CARD inflammasome polymerization in NLRP1 and CARD8.Competing Interest StatementH.W. is a co-founder of Ventus Therapeutics.

    "abstract": "Understanding how immunity to malaria is affected by declining transmission is important to aid vaccine design and understand disease resurgence. Both IgG subclasses and avidity of antigen-specific responses are important components of an effective immune response.Using a multiplex bead array assay, we measured the total IgG, IgG subclasses, and avidity profiles of responses to 18 P. falciparum blood stage antigens in samples from 160 Ugandans collected at 2 time points during high malaria transmission and 2 time points following a dramatic reduction in transmission.Results demonstrated that, for the antigens tested, (i) the rate of decay of total IgG following infection declined with age and was driven consistently by the decrease in IgG3 and occasionally the decrease in IgG1; (ii) the proportion of IgG3 relative to IgG1 in the absence of infection increased with age; (iii) the increase in avidity index (the strength of association between the antibody and antigen) following infection was largely due to a rapid loss of non-avid compared to avid total IgG; and (iv) both avid and non-avid total IgG in the absence of infection increased with age.Further studies are required to understand the functional differences between IgG1 and IgG3 in order to determine their contribution to the longevity of protective immunity to malaria. Measuring changes in antibody avidity may be a better approach of detecting affinity maturation compared to avidity index due to the differential expansion and contraction of high and low avidity total IgG.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) catalyzes trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 and is required for normal development of complex eukaryotes. The requirement for H3K27me3 in various aspects of mammalian differentiation is not clear. Though associated with repressed genes, the modification is not sufficient to induce gene repression, and in some instances is not required. To examine the role of the modification in mammalian differentiation, we blocked trimethylation of H3K27 with both a small molecule inhibitor, GSK343, and by introducing a point mutation into EZH2, the catalytic subunit of PRC2. We found that cells with substantively decreased H3K27 tri-methylation were able to differentiate, which contrasts with EZH2 null cells. Different PRC2 targets had varied requirements for H3K27me3 in repressive regulation with a subset that maintained normal levels of repression in the absence of methylation. The primary cellular phenotype when H3K27 tri-methylation was blocked was an inability of the altered cells to maintain a differentiated state when challenged. This phenotype was determined by H3K27me3 deposition both in embryonic stem cells and in the first four days of differentiation. H3K27 tri-methylation therefore was not necessary for formation of differentiated cell states but was required to maintain a stable differentiated state.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTMitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling is required for plant cell death responses to invading microbial pathogens. Ferric ions and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulate in rice (Oryza sativa) tissues undergoing cell death during Magnaporthe oryzae infection. Here, we report that rice MAP kinase (OsMEK2 and OsMPK1) signaling cascades are involved in iron- and ROS-dependent ferroptotic cell death responses of rice to M. oryzae infection. OsMEK2 interacted with OsMPK1 in the cytoplasm, and OsMPK1 moved from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to bind to the OsWRKY90 transcription factor. OsMEK2 expression may trigger OsMPK1-OsWRKY90 signaling pathways in the nucleus. Avirulent M. oryzae infection in \u0394Osmek2 mutant rice did not trigger iron and ROS accumulation and lipid peroxidation, and also downregulated OsMPK1, OsWRKY90, OsRbohB, and OsPR-1b expression. However, OsMEK2 overexpression induced ROS-and iron-dependent cell death in rice during M. oryzae infection. The downstream MAP kinase (OsMPK1) overexpression induced ROS- and iron-dependent ferroptotic cell death in the compatible rice-M. oryzae interaction. These data suggest that the OsMEK2-OsMPK1-OsWRKY90 signaling cascade is involved in the ferroptotic cell death in rice. The small-molecule inducer erastin triggered iron- and lipid ROS-dependent, but OsMEK2-independent, ferroptotic cell death in \u0394Osmek2 mutant plants during M. oryzae infection. Disease-related cell death was lipid ROS-dependent and iron-independent in the \u0394Osmek2 mutant plants. These combined results suggest that OsMEK2 and OsMPK1 expression positively regulates iron- and ROS-dependent ferroptotic cell death via OsMEK2-OsMPK1-OsWRKY90 signaling pathways, and blast disease (susceptibility)-related cell death was ROS-dependent but iron-independent in rice-M. oryzae interactions.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTFibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) play a critical role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Chronic inflammation induces transcriptomic and epigenetic modifications that imparts a persistent catabolic phenotype to the FLS, despite their dissociation from the inflammatory environment. We analyzed high throughput gene expression and chromatin accessibility data from human and mouse FLS from our and other studies available on public repositories, with the goal of identifying the persistently reprogrammed signaling pathways driven by chronic inflammation. We found that the gene expression changes induced by short-term tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) treatment were largely sustained in the FLS exposed to chronic inflammation. These changes that included both activation and repression of gene expression, were accompanied by the remodeling of chromatin accessibility. The sustained activated genes (SAGs) included established pro-inflammatory signaling components known to act at multiple levels of NF-kappaB, STAT and AP-1 signaling cascades. Interestingly, the sustained repressed genes (SRGs) included critical mediators and targets of the BMP signaling pathway. We thus identified sustained repression of BMP signaling as a unique constituent of the long-term inflammatory memory induced by chronic inflammation. We postulate that simultaneous targeting of these activated and repressed signaling pathways may be necessary to combat RA persistence.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Mutations in Fmr1, encoding the RNA binding protein FMRP, are leading causes of intellectual disability, autism, and female infertility, but FMRPs mechanism of action is controversial. In contrast to its previously postulated function as a translation repressor acting by stalling elongation, we recently found that FMRP activates translation initiation of large proteins in Drosophila oocytes up to [~]2-fold. We report here that FMRPs function as a translational activator is conserved in the mammalian brain. Reanalysis of mouse cortex ribosome profiling data shows that translation of large proteins in Fmr1 mutants is down-regulated 2.0-1.2-fold; ribosome stalling appears not to influence FMRP target protein translation in either cortex or oocyte tissue. Consistent with an activator function, most FMRP targets are associated with clinical syndromes when reduced, but not when over-expressed. Fmr1-dependent translation of one target, the N-end rule E3 ligase Poe/UBR4, occurs in microscopically visible ribonucleoprotein particles. These \"Poe particles\" require FMRP for their formation, are distinct from P bodies, and depend on actively elongating ribosomes, as indicated by their dissolution following a brief puromycin treatment. N-end rule-mediated proteolysis via Poe/UBR4 restrains cell growth and limits MAPK signaling in nervous tissue. Thus, loss of FMRP reduces production of an important growth repressor.",

    "abstract": "DFNA25 is an autosomal-dominant and progressive form of human deafness caused by mutations in the SLC17A8 gene, which encodes the vesicular glutamate transporter type 3 (VGLUT3). To resolve the mechanisms underlying DFNA25, we studied the phenotype of the mouse harboring the p.A221V mutation in human (corresponding to p.A224V in mouse). Using auditory brainstem response and distortion products of otoacoustic emissions, we showed that VGLUT3A224V/A224V mouse replicates the DFNA25 progressive hearing loss with intact cochlear amplification. Scanning electron microscopy examinations demonstrated fused stereocilia bundle of the inner hair cells (IHCs) as the primary cause for DFNA25. In addition, the IHC ribbon synapses undergo structural and functional modifications at later stages. Using super-resolution microscopy, we observed oversized synaptic ribbons associated with an increase in the rate of the sustained releasable pool of exocytosis. These results indicate that the primary defect in DFNA25 stems from a failure in the mechano-transduction followed by a change in synaptic transfer. The VGLUT3A224V/A224V mouse model opens the way to a deeper understanding and to a potential treatment of DFNA25.",

    "abstract": "There is an unresolved discrepancy between popular hierarchical and multiple-demand perspectives on the functional organisation of the human frontal lobes. Here, we tested alternative predictions of these perspectives with a novel fMRI switching paradigm. Each trial involved switching attention between stimuli, but at different levels of difficulty and abstraction. As expected, increasing response times were evident when comparing low-level perceptual switching to more abstract dimension, rule and task-switching. However, there was no evidence of an abstraction hierarchy within the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Nor was there recruitment of additional anterior PFC regions under increased switching demand. Instead, switching activated a widespread network of frontoparietal and cerebellar regions. Critically, the activity within PFC sub-regions uniformly increased with behavioural switch costs. We propose that both perspectives have some validity, but neither is complete. Too many studies have reported dissociations within MD for this volume to be functionally uniform, and the recruitment of more anterior regions with increased general difficulty cannot explain those results. Conversely, whilst reproducible evidence for a hierarchical functional organisation has been reported, this cannot be explained in terms of abstraction of representation or reconfiguration per se, because those interpretations generalise poorly to other task contexts.",

Inhibins contain an \u03b1-subunit (INHA) and a \u03b2-subunit (either INHBA or INHBB), while activins are mainly homodimers of either \u03b2A (INHBA) or \u03b2B (INHBB) subunits. Inhibins are biomarkers in a subset of cancers and utilize the coreceptors betaglycan (TGFBR3) and endoglin (ENG) for physiological or pathological outcomes. Given the array of prior reports on inhibin, activin and the coreceptors in cancer, this study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis, assessing their functional prognostic potential in cancer using a bioinformatics approach. We identify cancer cell lines and cancer types most dependent and impacted, which included p53 mutated breast and ovarian cancers and lung adenocarcinomas. Moreover, INHA itself was dependent on TGFBR3 and ENG in multiple cancer types. INHA, INHBA, TGFBR3, and ENG also predicted patients\u2019 response to anthracycline and taxane therapy in luminal A breast cancers. We also obtained a gene signature model that could accurately classify 96.7% of the cases based on outcomes. Lastly, we cross-compared gene correlations revealing INHA dependency to TGFBR3 or ENG influencing different pathways themselves. These results suggest that inhibins are particularly important in a subset of cancers depending on the coreceptor TGFBR3 and ENG and are of substantial prognostic value, thereby warranting further investigation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Deep mutational scanning enables data-driven models of protein structure and function. Here, we adapted Saturated Programmable Insertion Engineering as an economical and programmable deep mutational scanning technique. We validate this approach with an existing single mutant dataset in the PSD95 PDZ3 domain, and further characterize most pairwise double mutants to study how a mutation\u2019s phenotype depends on mutations at other sites, a phenomenon called epistasis. We observe wide-spread proximal negative epistasis, which we attribute to mutations affecting thermodynamic stability, and strong long-range positive epistasis, which is enriched in an evolutionarily conserved and function-defining network of \u2018sector\u2019 and clade-specifying residues. Conditional neutrality of mutations in clade-specifying residues compensates for deleterious mutations in sector positions. This suggests an outside-in hierarchy of interactions through which positive epistasis between clade-specifying residues and the PDZ sector facilitated the evolutionary expansion and specialization of PDZ domains.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",
