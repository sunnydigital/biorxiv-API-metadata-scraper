    "abstract": "Stop codon readthrough during translation occurs in many eukaryotes, including Drosophila, yeast, and humans. Recoding of UGA, UAG or UAA to specify an amino acid allows the ribosome to synthesize C-terminally extended proteins. We previously found evidence for tissue-specific regulation of stop codon readthrough in decoding the Drosophila kelch gene, whose first open reading frame (ORF1) encodes a subunit of a Cullin3-RING ubiquitin ligase. Here, we show that the efficiency of kelch readthrough varies markedly by tissue. Immunoblotting for Kelch ORF1 protein revealed high levels of the readthrough product in lysates of larval and adult central nervous system (CNS) tissue and larval imaginal discs. A sensitive reporter of kelch readthrough inserted after the second kelch open reading frame (ORF2) directly detected synthesis of Kelch readthrough product in these tissues. To analyze the role of cis-acting sequences in regulating kelch readthrough, we used cDNA reporters to measure readthrough in both transfected human cells and transgenic Drosophila. Results from a truncation series suggest that a predicted mRNA stem-loop 3\u2019 of the ORF1 stop codon stimulates high-efficiency readthrough. Expression of cDNA reporters using cell type-specific Gal4 drivers revealed that CNS readthrough is restricted to neurons. Finally, we show that high-effficiency readthrough in the CNS is common in Drosophila, raising the possibility that the neuronal proteome includes many proteins with conserved C-terminal extensions. This work provides new evidence for a remarkable degree of tissue- and cell-specific dynamic stop codon redefinition in Drosophila.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The BXD recombinant inbred strains of mice are an important reference population for systems biology and genetics that have been full sequenced and deeply phenotyped. To facilitate inter-active use of genotype-phenotype relations using many massive omics data sets for this and other segregating populations, we have developed new algorithms and code that enables near-real time whole genome QTL scans for up to 1 million traits. By using easily parallelizable operations including matrix multiplication, vectorized operations, and element-wise operations, we have decreased run-time to a few seconds for large transcriptome data sets. Our code is ideal for interactive web services, such as GeneNetwork.org. We used parallelization of different CPU threads as well as GPUs. We found that the speed advantage of GPUs is dependent on problem size and shape (number of cases, number of genotypes, number of traits). Our results provide a path for speeding up eQTL scans using linear mixed models (LMMs). Our implementation is in the Julia programming language.",

    "abstract": "RNAPII pausing immediately downstream of the transcription start site (TSS) is a critical rate limiting step at most metazoan genes that allows fine-tuning of gene expression in response to diverse signals1-5. During pause-release, RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) encounters an H2A.Z.1 nucleosome6-8, yet how this variant contributes to transcription is poorly understood. Here, we use high resolution genomic approaches2,9 (NET-seq and ChIP-nexus) along with live cell super-resolution microscopy (tcPALM)10 to investigate the role of H2A.Z.1 on RNAPII dynamics in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Using a rapid, inducible protein degron system11 combined with transcriptional initiation and elongation inhibitors, our quantitative analysis shows that H2A.Z.1 slows the release of RNAPII, impacting both RNAPII and NELF dynamics at a single molecule level. We also find that H2A.Z.1 loss has a dramatic impact on nascent transcription at stably paused, signal-dependent genes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that H2A.Z.1 inhibits re-assembly and re-initiation of the PIC to reinforce the paused state and acts as a strong additional pause signal at stably paused genes. Together, our study suggests that H2A.Z.1 fine-tunes gene expression by regulating RNAPII kinetics in mammalian cells.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies highlight the emerging role of lipids as important messengers in malaria parasite biology. In an attempt to identify interacting proteins and regulators of these dynamic and versatile molecules, we hypothesised the involvement of phospholipid translocases and their substrates in the infection of the host erythrocyte by the malaria parasite Plasmodium spp. Here, using a data base mining approach, we have identified a putative phospholipid (PL) scramblase in P. falciparum (PfPLSCR) that is conserved across the genus and in closely related unicellular algae. By reconstituting recombinant PfPLSCR into liposomes, we demonstrate metal ion dependent PL translocase activity and substrate preference, confirming PfPLSCR as a bona fide scramblase. We confirm that PfPLSCR is expressed during asexual and sexual parasite development, localising to different membranous compartments of the parasite throughout the intra-erythrocytic life cycle. Two different gene knockout approaches, however, suggest that PfPLSCR is not essential for erythrocyte invasion and asexual parasite development, pointing towards a possible role in other stages of the parasite life cycle.",

    "abstract": "Host IFNL4 haplotype status contributes to the development of chronic hepatitis C virus infection in individuals who are acutely infected with the virus. In silico studies revealed that specific amino acid variants at multiple sites on the HCV polyprotein correlate with functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IFNL4 locus. Thus, SNPs at the IFNL4 locus may select variants that influence virus replication and thereby outcome of infection. Here, we examine the most significantly IFNL4-associated amino acid variants that lie in the  Lambda (L) 2 loop of the HCV NS5B RNA polymerase. L2 loop variants were introduced into both sub-genomic replicon and full-length infectious clones of HCV and viral replication examined in the presence and absence of exogenous IFN{lambda}4. Our data demonstrate that while mutation of NS5B L2 loop affects replication, individual IFNL4-associated variants have modest but consistent effects on replication both in the presence and absence of IFN{lambda}4. Given the strong genetic association between these variants and IFNL4, these data suggest a nuanced effect of each individual position on viral replication, the combined effect of which might mediate resistance to the effects of IFN{lambda}4.",

    "abstract": "Downregulation of host gene expression is one of the key strategies adopted by intracellular pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) for their survival and subsequent pathogenesis. In a previous study, we have shown that HDAC1 levels go up in macrophages infected with MTB and it hypoacetylates histone H3 at the promoter of IL-12B gene leading to its downregulation. Here we show that after infection with MTB, the levels of the phosphorylated form of HDAC1 increase significantly in macrophages. Employing immunoprecipitation and LC-MS/MS, we found transcriptional repressor protein ZBTB25 associates with HDAC1 silencing complex along with transcriptional corepressor Sin3a. By chromatin immunoprecipitation and PCR analyses, we found that phosphorylated HDAC1, Sin3a, and ZBTB25 are recruited to the promoter of IL-12B to downregulate its expression in infected macrophages. Knocking down of ZBTB25 enhanced release of IL-12p40 from infected macrophages. Interestingly, the treatment of infected macrophages with CI994 (inhibitor of HDAC1) or dithiopyridine (inhibitor of ZBTB25) promoted the colocalization of LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3, a marker for autophagy) and MTB in autophagosomes. Induction of autophagy resulted in the killing of intracellular MTB. Enhanced phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT4 was observed in macrophages upon CI994 and dithiopyridine treatment, and inhibition of JAK2/STAT4 negated the killing of intracellular mycobacteria suggesting a possible role of these proteins in the autophagy-mediated killing of intracellular MTB.",

    "abstract": "Rev-Erb{beta} is a nuclear receptor that couples circadian rhythm, metabolism, and inflammation.1-7 Heme binding to the protein modulates its function as a repressor, its stability, its ability to bind other proteins, and its activity in gas sensing.8-11 Rev-Erb{beta} binds Fe3+-heme tighter than Fe2+-heme, suggesting its activities may be regulated by the heme redox state.9 Yet, this critical role of heme redox chemistry in defining the proteins resting state and function is unknown. We demonstrate by electrochemical and whole-cell electron paramagnetic resonance experiments that Rev-Erb{beta} exists in the Fe3+ form within the cell essentially allowing the protein to be heme-replete even at low concentrations of labile heme in the nucleus. However, being in the Fe3+ redox state contradicts Rev-Erbs known function as a gas sensor, which dogma asserts must be a Fe2+ protein This paper explains why the resting Fe3+-state is congruent both with heme-binding and cellular gas sensing. We show that the binding of CO/NO elicits a striking increase in the redox potential of the Fe3+/Fe2+ couple, characteristic of an EC mechanism in which the unfavorable Electrochemical reduction of heme is coupled to the highly favorable Chemical reaction of gas binding, making the reduction spontaneous. Thus, Fe3+-Rev-Erb{beta} remains heme-loaded, crucial for its repressor activity, and only undergoes reduction when diatomic gases are present. This work has broad implications for hemoproteins where ligand-triggered redox changes cause conformational changes influencing proteins function or inter-protein interactions, like NCoR1 for Rev-Erb{beta}. This study opens up the possibility of CO/NO-mediated regulation of the circadian rhythm through redox changes in Rev-Erb{beta}.",

    "abstract": "Human PrP (huPrP) is a high-affinity receptor for oligomeric A{beta}. Synthetic oligomeric A{beta} species are known to be heterogeneous, dynamic and transient, rendering their structural investigation particularly challenging. Here, we used huPrP to preserve A{beta} oligomers by co-precipitating them into large hetero-assemblies to investigate the conformation of A{beta}(1-42) oligomers and huPrP in the complex by solid-state MAS NMR spectroscopy. The disordered N-terminal region of huPrP becomes immobilized in the complex and therefore visible in dipolar spectra without adopting chemical shifts characteristic of a regular secondary structure. Most of the well-defined C-terminal part of huPrP is part of the rigid complex, and solid-state NMR spectra suggest a loss in regular secondary structure in the last two -helices. For A{beta}(1-42) oligomers in complex with huPrP, secondary chemical shifts reveal a substantial {beta}-strand content. Importantly, not all A{beta}(1-42) molecules within the complex have identical conformations. Comparison with the chemical shifts of synthetic A{beta} fibrils suggests that the A{beta} oligomer preparation represents a heterogeneous mixture of {beta}-strand-rich assemblies, of which some have the potential to evolve and elongate into different fibril polymorphs, reflecting a general propensity of A{beta} to adopt variable {beta}-structure conformers.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARYDuring angiogenesis, endothelial cells secrete proteins that make up a planar protein network surrounding blood vessels termed basement membrane (BM). Collagen type IV (Col IV) is a BM protein associated with early blood vessel morphogenesis and is essential for blood vessel stability. To date, little is known about how endothelial cells mediate intracellular transport and selective secretion of Col IV. We have identified the GTPase Rab10 as a major regulator of Col IV vesicular trafficking during vascular development. Knockdown of Rab10 reduced de novo Col IV secretion in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, we determined that Rab10 is an indirect mediator of Col IV secretion, partnering with atypical Rab25 to deliver the enzyme lysyl hydroxylase 3 (LH3) to Col IV-containing vesicles staged for secretion. Loss of Rab10 or Rab25 resulted in depletion of LH3 from Col IV-containing vesicles and rapid lysosomal degradation of Col IV. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Rab10 activation is downstream of Notch signaling, indicating a novel connection between permissive Notch-based vessel maturation programs and vesicle trafficking. Overall, our results illustrate both a new trafficking-based component in the regulated secretion of Col IV and how this vesicle trafficking program interfaces with Notch signaling to fine-tune BM secretion during blood vessel development.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Precisely altering gene expression is critical for understanding molecular processes of embryogenesis. Although some tools exist for transgene misexpression in developing chick embryos, we have refined and advanced them by simplifying and optimizing constructs for spatiotemporal control. To maintain expression over the entire course of embryonic development we use an enhanced piggyBac transposon system that efficiently integrates sequences into the host genome. We also incorporate a DNA targeting sequence to direct plasmid translocation into the nucleus and a D4Z4 insulator sequence to prevent epigenetic silencing. We designed these constructs to minimize their size and maximize cellular uptake, and to simplify usage by placing all of the integrating sequences on a single plasmid. Following electroporation of stage HH8.5 embryos, our tetracycline-inducible promoter construct produces robust transgene expression in the presence of doxycycline at any point during embryonic development in ovo or in culture. Moreover, expression levels can be modulated by titrating doxycycline concentrations and spatial control can be achieved using beads or gels. Thus, we have generated a novel, sensitive, tunable, and stable inducible-promoter system for high-resolution gene manipulation in vivo.View Full Text",

As B. pseudomallei is antibiotic-resistant, the need for cell-based vaccines and therapies is crucial to managing melioidosis. Dendritic cells (DC) provide the first line of defense to infection and direct downstream immune responses. Using practical volumes of fresh healthy donor blood, we show that heat-killed B. pseudomallei activated and stimulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-, IL-1{beta} and IL-6 from both myeloid and plasmacytoid DC. Furthermore, B. pseudomallei-pulsed DC induced activation and proliferation of CD4+ T-cells. Thus, both DC subsets are important for driving primary T helper cell responses to B. pseudomallei in healthy individuals and have the potential to be targeted for future therapies and vaccines.\n\nAuthor SummaryMelioidosis is an infectious disease endemic to south-east Asia and northern Australia caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. Melioidosis presents a significant public health threat because it has no effective vaccine or cure, leading to a high mortality rate of between 10-50%. We highlight the possibility of immune-based strategies targeting Burkholderia pseudomallei to better treat and prevent melioidosis. Specifically, we show that dendritic cells-the sentinel cells of the immune system-respond to B. pseudomallei in healthy individuals and in turn can orchestrate downstream protective immune responses. Thus, dendritic cells may be key players in the development of both vaccines and therapeutics for melioidosis as well as other bacteria-driven diseases.",

    "abstract": "Typhoid fever is caused by the bacteria Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) and remains a significant health problem in many developing countries. The lack of adequate diagnostic capabilities in these poor resource settings have contributed greatly in making typhoid fever endemic in these regions. Reliable and inexpensive diagnostic tests are needed to improve the management of this disease burden. This study evaluated the ability of staA, viaB and sopE genes to detect Salmonella spp. Conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of staA, viaB and sopE genes of Salmonella was used to detect and differentiate between the three most prevalent Salmonella spp. in Kenya (S. Typhi, S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis). The staA primers (StaA-Forward / StaA-Reverse) and viaB primers (vi-Forward / vi-Reverse) were found to be specific only for the different strains of S. Typhi, producing PCR products of 585 bp and 540 bp respectively. No amplification was observed with S. Typhimurium, S. Enteritidis, E. coli and S. boydii bacterial strains. The sopE primers (SopE-Forward / SopE-Reverse) was demonstrated to be specific for all Salmonella spp. producing a 465 bp PCR product with no amplification observed with the E. coli and S. boydii bacterial strains. Conventional PCR using these staA and viaB primers for detection of S. Typhi shows great potential for diagnosis of typhoid fever however, further studies need to be carried out with actual food samples and human samples (blood, stool or saliva) to determine the effectiveness of this method in the detection of common Salmonella spp. in Kenya.\n\nAuthor summaryTyphoid fever is a severe disease caused by the bacteria Salmonella Typhi (S. Typhi) and is a significant health problem in many developing countries. The lack of adequate diagnostic capabilities in poor resource settings common in most public health facilities in Kenya and Africa in general, hinder prompt diagnosis of typhoid fever. Currently, the available diagnostic tests are often expensive and more so not readily available in most resource poor endemic areas. This has often led to misdiagnosis of the disease, thereby delaying appropriate treatment and making typhoid fever widespread in most resource poor areas. This study examines the ability of three different genes to detect and differentiate between the three most prevalent Salmonella strains in Kenya using a readily available and widely used genetic test known as conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This research found that staA and viaB genes were specific only for S. Typhi, while the sopE gene was specific for all Salmonella strains. Consequently, conventional PCR using these staA and viaB genes for detection of S. Typhi shows great potential to be used as a readily available diagnostic tool to detect the presence of the S. Typhi organism in individuals or foods sample in Kenya.",

    "abstract": "Aedes aegypti, as one of the vectors transmitting several arboviruses, is a main target in mosquito control programs. Permethrin remains the major adulticide used to control these mosquitoes. The increasing percentage of permethrin resistant Aedes aegypti has become an important issue around the world. Knockdown resistance (kdr) is one of the major mechanisms related to permethrin resistance. On the other hand, detoxification genes including cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450) and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are also suggested as permethrin resistance apparatus. Here we selected a permethrin resistant (p-s) Aedes aegypti population from Florida and compared its mortality after exposure, median lethal dose (LD50), adult survivorship and larval development to several field populations. We used allele-specific PCR genotyping of the S989P, V1016I and F1534C sites in the sodium channel gene and gene expression analysis of several p450 and GSTs genes before and after permethrin exposure to determine their involvement in permethrin sensitivity between Ae. aegypti populations. Results indicated the p-s population had the highest resistance to permethrin based on LD50 and the mortality test. The larval development time did not significantly differ between the populations, however the p-s adults survived longer than the other populations. In the genotype study, p-s population had mostly homozygous mutations in all three mutant sites of the sodium channel gene. Detoxification gene expression studies showed that two p450 genes, AAEL009124 (CYP6N12) and, AAEL009127 (CYP6M11), were upregulated and, accession # AAEL006802, AAEL014891 (CYP6P12) and AAEL014619 (CYP9J22) were downregulated after 120 minutes of permethrin exposure in the p-s population. These results suggest that in highly permethrin resistant Aedes aegypti populations both kdr mutations and xenobiotic metabolism might be involved. Involvement of multiple mechanisms to achieve resistance to permethrin supports the need for implementing comprehensive mosquito control measures, such as an integrated pest management strategy, so that selection pressure for resistance is decreased without compromising control efforts while new methodologies are being developed.\n\nAuthor summaryPyrethroids have been applied as a major type of insecticide targeted at Aedes aegypti, a key vector in the transmission of several flaviviruses. Resistance to pyrethroids has emerged and has become a worldwide threat to mosquito control. Pyrethroid resistance usually occurs with knockdown resistance (kdr) where the voltage gated sodium channel is mutated. We selected a permethrin resistant (p-s) Aedes aegypti population from Florida and, along with two other field populations, examined three mutation sites, S989P, V1016I and F1534C. The data showed the p-s population had the most homozygous mutations which correlated to the permethrin resistance level. Besides kdr, detoxification genes also have been identified to have pyrethroid metabolizing abilities. We found two cytochrome P450 monooxygenases genes, CYP6N12 and CYP6M11, were overexpressed in the p-s population after permethrin exposure, suggesting a role in resistance to permethrin. Together, our results provide information about potential mechanisms used in major vectors with high insecticide resistance.",

    "abstract": "Preeclampsia (PE) is a life-threatening disease of pregnant women associated with severe hypertension, proteinuria, or multi-organ injuries. Mitochondrial-mediated placental oxidative stress plays a key role in the pathogenesis of PE. However, the underlying mechanism remains to be revealed. Here, we identify Rnd3, a small Rho GTPase, regulating placental mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). We showed that Rnd3 is down-regulated in primary trophoblasts isolated from PE patients. Loss of Rnd3 in trophoblasts resulted in excessive ROS generation, cell apoptosis, mitochondrial injury, and proton leakage from the respiratory chain. Moreover, Rnd3 overexpression partially rescues the mitochondrial defects and oxidative stress in human PE primary trophoblasts. Rnd3 physically interacts with the peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor {gamma} (PPAR{gamma}) and promotes the PPAR{gamma}-mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) cascade. Forced expression of PPAR{gamma} rescues deficiency of Rnd3-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction. We conclude that Rnd3 acts as a novel protective factor in placental mitochondria through PPAR{gamma}-UCP2 signaling and highlight that downregulation of Rnd3 is a potential factor involved in PE pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Camelina sativa is relatively drought tolerant and requires less fertilizer than other oilseed crops. Various lipid- and phenolic-based extracellular barriers of plants help to protect them against biotic and abiotic stresses. These barriers, which consist of solvent-insoluble polymeric frameworks and solvent-extractable waxes, include the cuticle of aerial plant surfaces and suberized cell walls found, for example, in periderms and seed coat. Cutin, the polymeric matrix of the cuticle, and the aliphatic domain of suberin are fatty acid- and glycerol-based polyesters. These polyesters were investigated by base-catalyzed transesterification of C. sativa aerial and underground delipidated tissues followed by gas chromatographic analysis of the released monomer mixtures. Seed coat and root suberin had similar compositions, with 18-hydroxyoctadecenoic and 1,18-octadecenedioic fatty acids being the dominant species. Root suberin presented a typical lamellar ultrastructure, but seed coats showed almost imperceptible, faint dark bands. Leaf and stem lipid polyesters were composed of fatty acids (FA), dicarboxylic acids (DCA), {omega}-hydroxy fatty acids (OHFA) and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives (HCA). Dihydroxypalmitate (DHP) and caffeic acid were the major constituents of leaf cutin, whereas stem cutin presented similar molar proportions in several monomers across the four classes. Unlike the leaf cuticle, the C. sativa stem cuticle presented lamellar structure by transmission electron microscopy. Flower cutin was dominated by DHP and did not contain aromatics. We found striking differences between the lipid polyester monomer compositions of aerial tissues of C. sativa and that of its close relatives Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica napus.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=96 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/163436v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (44K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d9f07eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13c1ca4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17c6f50org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7013e7_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Camelina sativa leaf and stem cutin is dominated by 16:0 dihydroxy fatty acid and aromatics, with dicarboxylic fatty acids representing 20-30 % of the monomers.

    "abstract": "Obesity is a growing epidemic worldwide and is a major risk factor for several chronic diseases, including diabetes, kidney disease, heart disease, and cancer. Obesity often leads to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM, via the increased production of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1). Our study combines different proteomic techniques to investigate the changes in the global proteome, secretome and phosphoproteome of adipocytes under chronic inflammation condition, as well as fundamental cross-talks between different cellular pathways regulated by chronic TNF\u03b1 exposure. Our results show that many key regulator proteins of the canonical and non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathways, such as Nfkb2, and its downstream effectors, including Csf-1 and Lgals3bp, directly involved in leukocyte migration and invasion, were significantly upregulated at the intra and extracellular levels, culminating in the progression of inflammation. Our data provides evidence of several key proteins that play a role in the development of insulin resistance.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Onchocerciasis also known as river blindness is a neglected tropical disease and the world\u2019s second-leading infectious cause of blindness in humans; it is caused by Onchocerca volvulus. Current therapies kill microfilariae but fail to kill the adult parasites, which reside within subcutaneous nodules. To support a more target-driven drug development that can also cure and thus support the elimination of this disease, an in-depth understanding of O. volvulus biology especially the factors that support the longevity of these worms in the human host (&gt;10 years) is required. However, research is hampered by a lack of access to adult worms. O. volvulus is an obligatory human parasite and no small animal models that can propagate this parasite were successfully developed. The current optimized 2-dimensional (2-D) in vitro culturing method starting with O. volvulus infective larvae does not yet support the development of mature adult worms. To overcome these limitations, we have developed 3-dimensional (3-D) culture systems that simulated the human in vivo niche using in vitro engineered skin and adipose tissue. We show that an optimized indirect co-culture of in vitro skin tissue with fourth-stage larvae supported a significant increase in growth until the pre-adult stage with a median length of 816 \u2013 831 \u03bcm as compared to 767 \u03bcm of 2-D cultured larvae. Notably, when larvae were co-cultured directly with adipose tissue models, a significant improvement for larval motility and thus fitness was observed; 95 % compared to 26 % in the 2-D system. These promising co-culture concepts are a first step to further improve the long-term development of adult worms in vitro, and thus provide the filarial research community with a valuable source of O. volvulus worms at various developmental stages, which may accelerate innovative unsolved biomedical inquiries into the parasite\u2019s biology.Author summary The filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus is an obligatory human parasite and the causative agent of onchocerciasis, better known as river blindness. In 2017, more than 20 million infections with O. volvulus were estimated worldwide, 99 % of the patients live in Africa. Current international control programs focus on the reduction of microfilaridermia by mass drug administration of ivermectin. However, to meet the elimination goals, additional therapy strategies are needed that also target the adult worms. As this parasite is obliged to humans, there are no small animal models that sustain the full life cycle of the parasite, thus greatly impeding the research on this filarial nematode. To overcome these drawbacks, we developed co-culture systems based on engineered human skin and adipose tissue that represent the in vivo niche of O. volvulus in which we were able to establish improved conditions of culturing to the pre-adult stages of the parasite. Furthermore, our new culture approach could significantly reduce the use of animal models currently used for drug testing of surrogate larvae.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "T cells expressing high levels of inhibitory receptors such as PD-1 and LAG-3 are a hallmark of chronic infections and cancer. Checkpoint blockade therapies targeting these receptors have been largely validated as promising strategies to restore exhausted T cell functions and clearance of chronic infections and tumors. The inability to develop long-term natural immunity in malaria-infected patients has been proposed to be at least partially accounted for by sustained expression of high levels of inhibitory receptors on T and B lymphocytes. While blockade or lack of PD-1/PD-L1 and/or LAG-3 was reported to promote better clearance of Plasmodium parasites in mice, how exactly these pathways contributes to protection is not known. Herein, using a mouse model of non-lethal P. yoelii (Py) infection, we reveal that the kinetics of blood parasitemia is indistinguishable between PD-1-/-, PD-L1-/- and WT mice. Yet, monoclonal antibody (mAb) blockade of LAG-3 in PD-L1-/- mice promoted accelerated control of blood parasite growth and clearance. We also report that i) the majority of LAG-3+ cells are T cells, ii) selective depletion of CD8+ T cells did not prevent anti-LAG-3-mediated protection, and iii) production of effector cytokines by CD4+ T cells is increased in anti-LAG-3-treated versus control mice. In addition, parasite-specific Ab serum titers and their ability to transfer protection from both groups of mice was comparable and depletion of CD4+ T cells prevented protection. Thus, taken together, these results are consistent with a model in which disruption of PD-L1 and LAG-3 on parasite-specific CD4+ T cells unleashes their ability to effectively clear blood parasites, independently from humoral responses.\n\nAuthor SummaryMalaria, caused by Plasmodium parasites, is a global burden for which an efficacious vaccine is urgently needed. The development of long-term immunity against malaria is unclear, but we know that both T and B (that produce antibodies, Ab) lymphocytes, that are subsets of white blood cells, are required. Studies in mouse models of malaria have suggested that sets of inhibitory receptors, namely LAG-3 and PD-1, expressed on cytotoxic and helper T lymphocytes hamper the development of effective immunity against malaria. Therapeutic blockade of these receptors was reported to enhance blood parasite clearance through the development of more protective parasite-specific helper T lymphocytes and Abs. Herein, we reveal that, while mice genetically deficient for the PD-1 pathway fail to clear blood parasites better than WT counterparts, anti-LAG-3 treatment does. Importantly, we found comparable parasite-specific Ab responses between all mouse groups, and Ab transfers conferred similar protection to newly infected mice. We also show that LAG-3 is mostly expressed on T lymphocytes, and that cytotoxic T lymphocytes are not involved in anti-LAG-3 accelerated clearance of parasites. Our results suggest that LAG-3 blockade acts on helper T lymphocytes to unleash their effector responses and enhance the control of blood-stage malaria, independently from parasite-specific Abs.",

    "abstract": "Many of the worlds most serious crop diseases are caused by hemibiotrophic fungi. These pathogens have evolved the ability to colonize living plant cells, suppressing plant immunity responses, before switching to necrotrophic growth, in which host cells die, providing the energy to fuel sporulation and spread of the fungus. How hemibiotrophic pathogens switch between these two lifestyles remains poorly understood. Here, we report that the devastating rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, manipulates host cellular pH to regulate hemibiotrophy. During infection by M. oryzae, host plant cells are alkalinized to pH 7.8 during biotrophic growth, but later acidified to pH 6.5 during necrotrophy. Using a forward genetic screen, we identified alkaline-sensitive mutants of M. oryzae that were blocked in biotrophic proliferation and impaired in induction of host cell acidification and necrotrophy. These mutants defined components of the PacC-dependent ambient pH signal transduction pathway in M. oryzae. We report that PacC exists as a full-length repressor, PacC559, and a truncated transcriptional activator, PacC222, which localize to the fungal nucleus during biotrophic growth and to the cytoplasm during necrotrophy. During biotrophy, PacC222 directly activates genes associated with nutrient acquisition and fungal virulence, while PacC559 represses genes associated with saprophytic mycelial growth and sporulation, which are subsequently de-repressed during necrotrophy. When considered together, our results indicate that temporal regulation of hemibiotrophy by M. oryzae requires PacC-dependent sensing and manipulation of host cellular pH.\n\nAuthor SummaryCrop diseases caused by fungi represent some of the most serious threats to global food security. Many fungal pathogens have evolved the ability to invade living plant tissue and suppress host immunity, before switching to a completely different mode of growth, in which they are able to kill host plant cells. This lifestyle- called hemibiotrophy -is exemplified by the blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, which causes devastating diseases of rice, wheat and many other grasses. We found that during infection by M. oryzae, host cells initially have an alkaline pH, when the fungus is growing in living tissue, but pH rapidly becomes acidic, as host tissue is killed. We identified mutants of the blast fungus that were sensitive to alkaline pH and this enabled us to identify the signal transduction pathway by which the fungus responds to changes in ambient pH. We found that mutants in the pH response pathway were blocked in invasive fungal growth and could not cause acidification of host tissue. Consequently, they are unable to cause blast disease. We characterized the central regulator of this pathway, the PacC transcription factor, which unusually can act as both a repressor and an activator of fungal gene expression. During biotrophic invasive growth, PacC activates many genes previously reported to be required for virulence, including several associated with nutrient acquisition, and at the same time represses genes associated with vegetative growth and sporulation. The PacC signaling pathway is therefore necessary for regulating the switch in fungal lifestyle associated with causing blast disease.",

    "abstract": "The threat to public health posed by drug-resistant bacteria is rapidly increasing, as some of healthcares most potent antibiotics are becoming obsolete. Approximately two-thirds of the worlds antibiotics are derived from natural products produced by Streptomyces encoded biosynthetic gene clusters. Thus, in order to identify novel gene clusters, we sequenced the genomes of four bioactive Streptomyces strains isolated from the soil in San Diego County and used Bacterial Cytological Profiling adapted for agar plate culturing in order to examine the mechanisms of bacterial inhibition exhibited by these strains. In the four strains, we identified 101 biosynthetic gene clusters. Some of these clusters were predicted to produce previously studied antibiotics; however, the known mechanisms of these molecules could not fully account for the antibacterial activity exhibited by the strains, suggesting that novel clusters might encode antibiotics. When assessed for their ability to inhibit the growth of clinically isolated pathogens, three Streptomyces strains demonstrated activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Additionally, due to the utility of bacteriophages for genetically manipulating bacterial strains via transduction, we also isolated four new phages (BartholomewSD, IceWarrior, Shawty, and TrvxScott) against S. platensis. A genomic analysis of our phages revealed nearly 200 uncharacterized proteins, including a new site-specific serine integrase that could prove to be a useful genetic tool. Sequence analysis of the Streptomyces strains identified CRISPR-Cas systems and specific spacer sequences that allowed us to predict phage host ranges. Ultimately, this study identified Streptomyces strains with the potential to produce novel chemical matter as well as integrase-encoding phages that could potentially be used to manipulate these strains.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial small RNAs play a remarkable role in the regulation of functions involved in host-pathogen interaction. ErsA is a small RNA of Pseudomonas aeruginosa that contributes to the regulation of bacterial virulence traits such as biofilm formation and motility. Shown to take part in a regulatory circuit under the control of the envelope stress response sigma factor {sigma}22, ErsA targets post-transcriptionally the key virulence-associated gene algC. Moreover, ErsA contributes to biofilm development and motility through the post-transcriptional modulation of the transcription factor AmrZ. Intending to evaluate the regulatory relevance of ErsA in the pathogenesis of respiratory infections, we analyzed the impact of ErsA-mediated regulation on the virulence potential of P. aeruginosa and the stimulation of the inflammatory response during the infection of bronchial epithelial cells and a murine model. Furthermore, we assessed ErsA expression in a collection of P. aeruginosa clinical pulmonary isolates and investigated the link of ErsA with acquired antibiotic resistance by generating an ersA gene deletion mutant in a multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa strain which has long been adapted in the airways of a cystic fibrosis (CF) patient. Our results show that the ErsA-mediated regulation is relevant for the P. aeruginosa pathogenicity during acute infection and contributes to the stimulation of the host inflammatory response. Besides, ErsA could be subjected to selective pressure for P. aeruginosa patho-adaptation and acquirement of resistance to antibiotics commonly used in clinical practice during chronic CF infections. Our findings establish the role of ErsA as an important regulatory element in the host-pathogen interaction.\n\nAuthor summaryPseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most critical multi-drug resistant opportunistic pathogen in humans, able to cause both lethal acute and chronic lung infections. Thorough knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms involved in the establishment and persistence of the airways infections by P. aeruginosa remains elusive. Emerging candidates as molecular regulators of pathogenesis in P. aeruginosa are small RNAs, which act post-transcriptionally as signal transducers of host cues. Known for being involved in the regulation of biofilm formation and responsive to envelope stress response, we show that the small RNA ErsA can play regulatory roles in acute infection, stimulation of host inflammatory response, mechanisms of acquirement of antibiotic resistance and adaptation during the chronic lung infections of cystic fibrosis patients. Elucidating the complexity of the networks regulating host-pathogen interaction is crucial to identify novel targets for future therapeutic applications.",

We tested whether colony size can be used as early predictor for potential colony losses, in particular due to the parasitic mite Varroa destructor. V. destructor is one of the most important causes for these losses. Such early predictor for potential V. destructor induced losses is especially relevant as measuring V. destructor load in colonies is difficult and cumbersome. During three years, we monitored colonies with high and low V. destructor load from July until March of the next year. We found that differences in colony size were only visible after November, even though we lost almost all colonies every winter in the group with high V. destructor load. In the Northern hemisphere, November is considered to be too late for beekeepers to strengthen colonies in preparation for winter. We therefore argue that early-warning signs for potential colony losses due to V. destructor are urgently needed to allow beekeepers preventing winter losses. We discuss the role of precision apiculture to monitor the health and productivity of honeybee colonies.",

    "abstract": "In this work, dielectric studies on Neocaridina davidi shrimps have been presented. The effect of starvation on dielectric properties such as conductivity or permittivity have been shown. It was found that the onset frequency of electrode polarization depends on starvation period, which is probably related to the cytoplasm viscosity. In the dielectric spectra of shrimps two relaxation processes have been identified i.e. \u03b1 and \u03b2 process. The \u03b1 process is probably related to the counter ion polarization while \u03b2 process to the mobility of macromolecules present in the body of a shrimp, mainly to the amount of lipids. It was also found that there is a difference in dielectric response between control group and the group regenerated after 14 day starvation period. Basing on dielectric response, one can conclude that the viscosity of cytoplasm of regenerated shrimps is higher and the cells are rich in the lipid droplets when compared to control group.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive breast cancer subtype characterized by a remarkable molecular heterogeneity. Currently, there are no effective druggable targets and advanced preclinical models of the human disease. Here, we generated a unique mouse model (MMTV-R26Met mice) of mammary tumors driven by a subtle increase in the expression of the wild-type MET receptor. MMTV-R26Met mice develop spontaneous, exclusive TNBC tumors, recapitulating primary resistance to treatment of patients. Proteomic profiling of MMTV-R26Met tumors and machine learning approach showed that the model faithfully recapitulates inter-tumoral heterogeneity of human TNBC. Further signaling network analysis highlighted potential druggable targets, of which co-targeting of WEE1 and BCL-XL synergistically killed TNBC cells and efficiently induced tumor regression. Mechanistically, BCL-XL inhibition exacerbates the dependency of TNBC cells on WEE1 function, leading to Histone H3 and phosphoS33RPA32 upregulation, RRM2 downregulation, cell cycle perturbation, mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis. Our study introduces a unique, powerful mouse model for studying TNBC formation and evolution, its heterogeneity, and for identifying efficient therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "The gastrointestinal (GI) tract has long been hypothesized to play an integral role in the pathophysiology of sepsis, and gut microbiota (GM) dysbiosis may be the key factor. Previous studies has confirmed that microbiome is markedly altered in critical illness. We aimed to confirm the existence of gut microbiota imbalance in the early stage of sepsis, observe the effect of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on sepsis, and explore whether FMT can reconstruct the GM of septic mice and restore its protective function on the intestinal mucosal barrier. Through the study of flora, mucus layer, tight junction, immune barrier, and short-chain fatty acid changes in septic mice and fecal microbiota transplanted mice, we found that GM imbalance exists early in sepsis. FMT can improve morbidity and effectively reduce mortality in septic mice. After the fecal bacteria were transplanted, the abundance and diversity of the gut flora were restored, and the microbial characteristics of the donors changed. FMT can effectively reduce epithelial cell apoptosis, improve the composition of the mucus layer, upregulate the expression of tight junction proteins, and reduce intestinal permeability and the inflammatory response, thus protecting the intestinal barrier function. After FMT, Lachnospiraceae contributes the most to intestinal protection through enhancement of the L-lysine fermentation pathway, resulting in the production of acetate and butanoate, and may be the key bacteria for short-chain fatty acid metabolism and FMT success.",
