    "abstract": "Intercellular communication through the secretion of soluble factors plays a vital role in a wide range of biological processes (e.g., homeostasis, immune response), yet identification and quantification of many of these factors can be challenging due to their degradation or sequestration in cell culture media prior to analysis. Here, we present a customizable bead-based system capable of simultaneously binding to live cells (through antibody-mediated cell-tethering) and capturing cell-secreted molecules. Our functionalized beads capture secreted molecules (e.g., hepatocyte growth factor secreted by fibroblasts) that are diminished when sampled via traditional supernatant analysis techniques (p < 0.05), effectively rescuing reduced signal in the presence of neutralizing components in the cell culture media. Our system enables capture and analysis of molecules integral to chemical communication that would otherwise be markedly decreased prior to analysis.\n\nFor Table of Contents Only\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=101 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/147140v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17fbf42org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e5b810org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@972783org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a32eb0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Permanent grassland (PG) is an important agricultural land use for the delivery of multiple ecosystem services (ES), including carbon sequestration, water quality protection, food production, habitat provision, and cultural activities. However, PG environments are threatened by sub-optimal management, cultivation, and abandonment that are influenced by context, land managers attitudes and societal demand for ES. Therefore, the perceptions and attitudes of key decision-makers (farmers) and other stakeholders (non-farmers, including citizens and consumers of the products of permanent grasslands, and ES) need to be understood to ensure the sustainability of PGs and the ES they provide. A systematic review of the literature identified 135 scholarly articles. Application of thematic analysis, allowed the organization, and synthesis of current research related to (different) stakeholder attitudes, and how these influence PG management and the delivery of ES. The results suggest that different stakeholders hold different views towards permanent grassland, with farmers in particular having to balance economic with other (potentially conflicting) drivers. The types of knowledge held by different groups of stakeholders, access to sources of information, as well as the influence of knowledge on behaviour; and environmental values (for example in relation to aesthetics or conservation of biodiversity) explained why certain motivations for attitudes and behaviours are held. A major gap, however, was identified in relation to PG as opposed to other types of landscape.",

We explored population genomic signatures of American and Old World FAW and identified 12 maternal mitochondrial DNA genome lineages across the invasive range, while from 870 high-quality nuclear single nucleotide polymorphic DNA markers five distinct New World population clusters were identified, broadly reflected their native geographical ranges and absence of host-plant preferences. We identified unique admixed Old World populations, and admixed and non-admixed Asian FAW individuals, all of which suggested multiple introductions underpinned the pests global spread. Directional gene flow from the East into eastern Africa was also detected, in contrast to the west-to-east spread hypothesis.

    "abstract": "BackgroundVector control using larvicides is the main alternative strategy to address limits of preventive chemotherapy using ivermectin to fight onchocerciasis. However, it remains substantially limited by implementation difficulties, ecological concerns and resistance of vector populations. Therefore, efficient and environmentally safe alternative control strategies are still needed. This study explores the role of blackfly bacterial communities both on vector competence and refractoriness to O. volvulus infection in order to determine their potential as a novel vector control-based approach to fight onchocerciasis.\n\nPrincipal findingsA total of 1,270 blackflies were dissected and the infection rate was 10.1%, indicative of ongoing transmission of onchocerciasis in the surveyed communities. Sequencing process revealed 19 phyla and 210 genera, highlighting the diversity of gut blackflies bacterial communities. Wolbachia was the predominant genus with 70% of relative abundance of blackflies gut bacterial communities. Serratia sp and Acidomonas genera were significantly abundant among infected blackflies (p=0.043 and p=0.027, respectively), whereas other genera as Brevibacterium were associated with the absence of infection (p=0.008).\n\nConclusion/SignificanceThis study revealed that blackfly native bacteria are potentially involved in infection by O. volvulus, either by facilitating or preventing the parasite infestation of the vector. These bacteria represent an interesting potential as a biological target for a novel approach of vector control to fight onchocerciasis.\n\nAuthor summaryStudies of arthropods involved in vector-borne diseases (tsetse flies, mosquitoes, and drosophila) demonstrated the importance of their native bacteria either to ease infection and transmission of human pathogenic microorganisms including parasites or on the contrary to induce host protective effects against these parasites. Indeed, some native bacteria of arthropod vectors are now recognized to be associated either with the resistance of their hosts to parasitic infections, or the reduction of their hosts viability in case of the parasite infestation, thus highlighting the potential of such bacteria to be used as biological tool for vector control strategies. However, such bacteria have never been described on blackfly, an arthropod transmitting Onchocerca volvulus, which is the parasite responsible of onchocerciasis commonly known as river blindness. This study aimed to fill this gap by investigating the bacterial diversity of blackfly bacteriome and describing the possible role of bacteria communities in susceptibility/resistance features of the blackflies to O. volvulus infection, and therefore their potential as biological targets or tool for vector control. The screening of these blackflies native bacteria during this study, highlighted some bacteria genera of interest with significant association either with the absence of O. volvulus in blackfly or with vector infection.",

    "abstract": "Larvae of the cestodes Taenia solium and Taenia crassiceps infect the central nervous system of humans. Taenia solium larvae in the brain cause neurocysticercosis, the leading cause of adult-acquired epilepsy worldwide. Relatively little is understood about how cestode-derived products modulate host neural and immune signalling. Acetylcholinesterases, a class of enzyme that degrade acetylcholine, are produced by a host of parasitic worms to aid their survival in the host. Acetylcholine is an important signalling molecule in both the human nervous and immune systems, with powerful modulatory effects on the excitability of cortical networks. Therefore, it is important to establish whether cestode derived acetylcholinesterases may alter host neuronal cholinergic signalling. Here we make use of multiple techniques to profile acetylcholinesterase activity in different extracts of both Taenia crassiceps and Taenia solium larvae. We find that the larvae of both species contain substantial acetylcholinesterase activity. However, acetylcholinesterase activity is lower in Taenia solium as compared to Taenia crassiceps larvae. Further, whilst we observed acetylcholinesterase activity in all fractions of Taenia crassiceps larvae, including on the membrane surface and in the excreted/secreted extracts, we could not identify acetylcholinesterases on the membrane surface or in the excreted/secreted extracts of Taenia solium larvae. Finally, using whole-cell patch clamp recordings in rat hippocampal brain slice cultures, we demonstrate that Taenia larval derived acetylcholinesterases can modify neuronal responses to acetylcholine. Together, these findings highlight the possibility that Taenia larval acetylcholinesterases can interfere with cholinergic signalling in the host, potentially contributing to pathogenesis in neurocysticercosis.\n\nAuthor summaryInfection of the human nervous system with larvae of the parasite Taenia solium is a significant cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide. Despite this, the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis in neurocysticercosis remain unclear. Acetylcholinesterases are a family of enzymes widely produced by helminthic parasites. These enzymes facilitate the breakdown of acetylcholine, which is also a major neurotransmitter in the human nervous system. If T. solium larvae produce acetylcholinesterases, this could potentially disrupt host cholinergic signalling, which may in turn contribute to seizures and epilepsy. We therefore set out to investigate the presence and activity of acetylcholinesterases in T. solium larvae, as well as in Taenia crassiceps larvae, a species commonly used as a model parasite in neurocysticercosis research. We found that both T. crassiceps and T. solium larvae produce acetylcholinesterases with substantial activity. We further demonstrate that the acetylcholinesterase activity in the products of these parasites is sufficient to disrupt cholinergic signalling in an ex vivo brain slice model. This study provides evidence that Taenia larvae produce acetylcholinesterases and that these can interfere with cholinergic signalling in the host and potentially contribute to pathogenesis in neurocysticercosis.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with higher levels of compulsivity exhibit poorer performance on tasks that require model-based planning but the underlying causes have yet to be established. Here, we sought to determine whether these deficits stem from impoverished action-outcome relational knowledge (i.e. issues building an accurate model of the world) and/or an inability to translate models into action. 192 participants performed a two-step reinforcement learning task with concurrent EEG recordings. We found that representations of task-relevant action-outcome associations reflected in reaction time and parietal-occipital alpha-band power were stronger in individuals whose decisions were more model-based, and critically, were weaker in those high in compulsivity. At the time of choice, mid-frontal theta power, a general marker of cognitive control, was also negatively associated with compulsivity, but not model-based planning. These data suggest that model-based planning deficits in compulsive individuals may arise from failures in building an accurate model of the world.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe corpus callosum (CC) serves as the bridge that relays information between the two cerebral hemispheres, and is one of the most commonly injured areas after traumatic brain injury (TBI). This study was designed to investigate the association between the CC integrity and language function after TBI.\n\nMethodsWe retrospectively enrolled 30 patients with TBI who underwent diffusion tensor imaging and language function evaluation using the Western Aphasia Battery. The CC was divided into five segments (C1-C5) according to its projecting fibers using Hofers method, and fractional anisotropy (FA) values were measured using DSI studio software. The FA values of the left arcuate fasciculus and cingulum for language function and executive function, respectively, were also evaluated. Twelve healthy controls were also enrolled to compare the FA values of these tracts.\n\nResultsThe FA values of the cingulum and left arcuate fasciculus were significantly correlated with all language scores. The FA values of the entire CC were significantly correlated with the fluency, repetition, and aphasia quotient scores. The FA values of the anterior CC segment (C1 and C2) significantly correlated with the aphasia quotient score; C1 with the fluency score; and C2 with the fluency, comprehension, and repetition scores. However, the FA values of the posterior CC (C3-C5) were not significantly correlated with any of the language subset scores.\n\nConclusionThe language function in patients with TBI is correlated with the integrity of the white matter tracts important for language and attention processes. Moreover, disruption of the CC is common after TBI, and the anterior CC segment plays an important role in language impairment after TBI. Therefore, analyzing CC integrity using diffusion tensor imaging can help predict language impairment in patients with TBI.",

In human and primate studies, the right posterior parietal cortex (PPC) shows dominance for sustained attention, and phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) throughout the frontoparietal network correlates with performance on attention tasks. Here we evaluate oscillatory dynamics of bilateral PPC in mice during the 5-Choice Serial Reaction Time Task (5-CSRTT). Right PPC theta-gamma PAC (TG-PAC) and gamma power were independently elevated to a greater degree than the left PPC during the period prior to a correct response and were significantly correlated with accuracy in both simple and difficult tasks. Greater task difficulty was also associated with greater hemispheric asymmetry in TG-PAC, favoring the right PPC. These findings highlight the engagement of PPC with sustained attention in mice, reflected by increases in TG-PAC and gamma power, with maximal expression in the right hemisphere.",

    "abstract": "Measurement of cortical voluntary activation (VA) with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is limited by technical challenges. One challenge is the difficulty in preferential stimulation of cortical neurons projecting to the target muscle and minimal stimulation of cortical neurons projecting to antagonists. Thus, the motor evoked potential (MEP) response to TMS in the target muscle compared to its primary antagonist may be an important parameter in the assessment of cortical VA. Modulating isometric elbow angle alters the magnitude of MEPs at rest. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of isometric elbow flexion-extension angle on: 1) the ratio of biceps MEP relative to the triceps MEP amplitude across a range of voluntary efforts, and 2) cortical VA. Ten non-impaired participants completed three sessions wherein VA was determined using TMS at 45{degrees}, 90{degrees} and 120{degrees} of isometric elbow flexion, and peripheral electrical stimulation at 90{degrees} of elbow flexion. The biceps/triceps MEP ratio was greater in the more flexed elbow angle (120{degrees} flexion) compared to 90{degrees} during contractions of 50% and 75% of maximum voluntary contraction. Cortical VA assessed in the more extended elbow angle (45{degrees} flexion) was lower relative to 90{degrees} elbow flexion; this effect was dependent on the biceps/triceps MEP ratio. Cortical VA was sensitive to small changes in the linearity of the voluntary torque and superimposed twitch relationship, regardless of the elbow angle. Peripheral and cortical VA measures at 90{degrees} of elbow flexion were repeatable across three days. In conclusion, although the biceps/triceps MEP ratio was increased at a more flexed elbow angle relative to 90{degrees}, there was not a corresponding difference in cortical VA. Thus, increasing the MEP ratio via elbow angle did not affect estimation of cortical VA.",
