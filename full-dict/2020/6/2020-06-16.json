    "abstract": "The phylogenetic and functional diversity of microbial communities in tropical rainforests, and how these differ from temperate communities remain poorly described but are directly related to the increased fluxes of greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide (N2O) from the tropics. Towards closing these knowledge gaps, we analyzed replicated shotgun metagenomes representing distinct life zones from four locations in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF), Puerto Rico. These soils had a distinct microbial community composition and lower species diversity when compared to temperate grasslands or agricultural soils. Unlike temperate soils, LEF soils showed little stratification with depth in the first 0-30cm, with ~45% of community composition differences explained solely by location. The relative abundances and nucleotide sequences of N2O reductases (nosZ) were highly similar between tropical forest and temperate soils. However, respiratory NO reductase (norB) was 2-fold more abundant in the tropical soils, which might be relatable to their greater N2O emissions. Nitrogen fixation (nifH) also showed higher relative abundance in rainforest compared to temperate soils (20% vs. 0.1-0.3% of bacterial genomes in each soil type harbored the gene, respectively). Collectively, these results advance our understanding of spatial diversity and metabolic repertoire of tropical rainforest soil communities, and should facilitate future ecological modeling efforts.\n\nImportanceTropical rainforests are the largest terrestrial sinks of atmospheric CO2 and the largest natural source of N2O emissions, two critical greenhouse gases for the climate. The microbial communities of rainforest soils that directly or indirectly, through affecting plant growth, contribute to these fluxes remain poorly described by cultured-independent methods. To close this knowledge gap, the present study applied shotgun metagenomics to samples selected from 3 distinct life zones within the Puerto Rico rainforest. The results advance our understanding of microbial community diversity in rainforest soils and should facilitate future studies of natural or manipulated perturbations of these critical ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is driving range shifts, and a lack of cold tolerance is hypothesized to constrain insect range expansion at poleward latitudes. However, few, if any, studies have tested this hypothesis during autumn when organisms are subjected to sporadic low temperature exposure but may not have become cold tolerant yet. In this study, we integrated organismal thermal tolerance measures into species distribution models for larvae of the Giant Swallowtail butterfly, Papilio cresphontes, living at the northern edge of its actively expanding range. Cold hardiness of field-collected larvae was determined using three common metrics of cold-induced physiological thresholds: the supercooling point (SCP), critical thermal minimum (CTmin), and survival following cold exposure. P. cresphontes larvae in autumn have a CTmin of 2.14{degrees}C, and were determined to be tolerant of chilling. These larvae have a SCP of -6.6{degrees}C and can survive prolonged exposure to -2{degrees}C. They generally die, however, at temperatures below their SCP (-8{degrees}C), suggesting they are chill tolerant or modestly freeze avoidant. Using this information, we examined the importance of low temperatures at a broad scale, by comparing species distribution models of P. cresphontes based only on environmental data derived from other sources to models that also included the cold tolerance parameters generated experimentally. Our modelling revealed that growing degree-days and precipitation best predicted the distribution of P. cresphontes, while the cold tolerance variables did not explain much variation in habitat suitability. As such, the modelling results were consistent with our experimental results: low temperatures in autumn are unlikely to limit the distribution of P. cresphontes. Further investigation into the ecological relevance of the physiological thresholds determined here will help determine how climate limits the distribution of P. cresphontes. Understanding the factors that limit species distributions is key to predicting how climate change will drive species range shifts.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19. Severe COVID-19 disease has been associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombosis, but the mechanisms underlying COVID-19-related coagulopathy remain unknown. Since the risk of severe COVID-19 disease is higher in males than in females and increases with age, we combined proteomics data from SARS-CoV-2-infected cells with human gene expression data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database to identify gene products involved in coagulation that change with age, differ in their levels between females and males, and are regulated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This resulted in the identification of transferrin as a candidate coagulation promoter, whose levels increases with age and are higher in males than in females and that is increased upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. A systematic investigation of gene products associated with the GO term \"blood coagulation\" did not reveal further high confidence candidates, which are likely to contribute to COVID-19-related coagulopathy. In conclusion, the role of transferrin should be considered in the course of COVID-19 disease and further examined in ongoing clinic-pathological investigations.",

    "abstract": "Alternate bearing, seen in many types of plants, is the variable yield with a strongly biennial pattern. In this paper, we introduce a new model for alternate bearing behavior. Similar to the well-known Resource Budget Model, our model is based on the balance between photosynthesis (carbon accumulation) and reproduction processes. We consider two novel features with our model, 1) the existence of a finite capacity in the trees resource reservoir and 2) the possibility of having low (but non-zero) yield when the trees energy level is low. We achieve the former using a density dependent resource accumulation function, and the latter by removing the concept of the well-defined threshold used in the Resource Budget Model. At the level of an individual tree, our model has a stable two-cycle solution, which is suitable to model plants in which the alternate bearing behavior is pronounced. We incorporate environmental stochasticity by adding two uncorrelated noise terms to the parameters of the model associated with the carbon accumulation and reproduction processes. Furthermore, we examine the models behavior on a system of two coupled trees with direct coupling. Unlike the coupled Resource Budget Model, for which the only stable solution is the out-of-phase solution, our model with diffusive coupling has stable in-phase period-2 solutions. This suggests that our model might serve to explain spatial synchrony on a larger scale.",

    "abstract": "A low-frequency variant of SVEP1, an extracellular matrix protein, is associated with risk of coronary disease in humans independent of plasma lipids. Despite a robust statistical association, however, it was unclear if and how SVEP1 might contribute to atherosclerosis. Here, using Mendelian randomization and complementary mouse models, we provide evidence that SVEP1 promotes atherosclerosis in humans and mice. We find that SVEP1 is expressed by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) within the atherosclerotic plaque. VSMCs also interact with SVEP1, causing proliferation and dysregulation of key differentiation pathways, including integrin and Notch signaling. Fibroblast growth factor receptor transcription increases in VSMCs interacting with SVEP1, and is further increased by the coronary disease-associated SVEP1 variant. These effects ultimately drive inflammation and promote atherosclerosis. Taken together, our results suggest that VSMC-derived SVEP1 is a pro-atherogenic factor, and support the concept that pharmacological inhibition of SVEP1 should protect against atherosclerosis in humans.",

    "abstract": "The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a huge threat to many countries around the world. However, where is it origin and which animals are sensitive to cross-species transmission is unclear. The interaction of virus and cell receptor is a key determinant of host range for the novel coronavirus. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is demonstrated as the primary entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we evaluated the SARS-CoV-2 entry mediated by ACE2 of 11 different species of animals, and discovered that ACE2 of Rhinolophus sinicus (Chinese horseshoe bat), Felis catus (domestic cat), Canis lupus familiaris (dog), Sus scrofa (pig), Capra hircus (goat) and especially Manis javanica (Malayan pangolin) were able to render SARS-CoV-2 entry in non-susceptible cells. This is the first report that ACE2 of Pangolin could mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry which increases the presume that SARS-CoV-2 may have a pangolin origin. However, none of the ACE2 proteins from Rhinolophus ferrumequinum (greater horseshoe bat), Gallus gallus (chicken), Notechis scutatus (mainland tiger snake), Mus musculus (house mouse) rendered SARS-CoV-2 entry. Specifically, a natural isoform of Macaca mulatta (Rhesus monkey) ACE2 with a mutation of Y217N was resistance to infection, which rises the possible impact of this type of ACE2 during monkey studies of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, these results clarify that SARS-CoV-2 could engage receptors of multiple species of animals and it is a perplexed work to track SARS-CoV-2 origin and its intermediate hosts.\n\nIMPORTANCEIn this study, we illustrated that SARS-CoV-2 is able to engage receptors of multiple species of animals. This indicated that it may be a perplexed work to track SARS-CoV-2 origin and discover its intermediate hosts. This feature of virus is considered to potentiate its diverse cross-species transmissibility. Of note, here is the first report that ACE2 of Pangolin could mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry which increases the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 may have a pangolin origin. And we also demonstrated that not all species of bat were sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. At last, it is also important to detect the expression ratio of the Y217N ACE2 to the prototype in Rhesus monkeys to be recruited for studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "2The involvement of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) in working memory is controversially discussed. Critically, it is unclear whether and how the MTL supports performance of working memory. We recorded single neuron firing in 13 epilepsy patients while they performed a visual working memory task. The number of colored squares in the stimulus set determined the workload of the trial. We used the subjects memory capacity (Cowans K) to split them into a low and high capacity group. We found MTL neurons that showed persistent firing during the maintenance period. Firing was higher in the hippocampus for trials with correct compared to incorrect performance. Population firing predicted workload particularly during the maintenance period. Prediction accuracy of single trial activity was strongest for neurons in the entorhinal cortex of low capacity subjects. We provide evidence that low capacity subjects recruit their MTL to cope with an overload of working memory task demands.\n\n1 SignificanceHumans are highly limited in processing multiple objects over a short period of time. The capacity to retain multiple objects in working memory is typically associated with frontal and parietal lobe functioning, even though medial temporal lobe (MTL) neural architecture seems capable to process such information. However, there are conflicting findings from patient, electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies. Here we show for the first time that correct performance, workload and individual performance differences are reflected in separate mechanisms of neural activity within the MTL during maintenance of visual information in working memory. The data suggest that low capacity subjects use the MTL to process the overload of information.",

Previous studies have shown differences in behavior of neoplasms depending on their histopathological as well as immunohistochemical categories; in particular, triple negative breast cancers (on IHC) show the worst prognosis.Objectives To find association, if any, within conventional histopathological characteristics (size, grade, stage, mitotic count, desmoplasia, dense inflammatory infiltrate, lymphovascular invasion) and between the conventional parameters and immunohistochemical categories of breast cancer, in both primary and post neo adjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) specimens.Methods 177 breast cancer excision specimens examined over last 7 years were assessed retrospectively, their histopathological parameters were recorded. In cases where immunohistochemistry was performed (N=108) the specimen was placed in one of the immunohistochemical categories: Luminal A, Luminal B, Her2 and Triple negative cancers. The data was then analysed by standard statistical methods.Results No statistically significant association was found between the histopathological parameters and IHC category was. However, a strong correlation was seen between lymphovascular invasion within the primary tumor and increasing lymph node involvement. There was also a reduction in ER and PR expression in neoplasms post NACT, while HER2 expression remained largely unchanged.Conclusion There might be additional genetic subtypes underlying the immunohistochemical phenotypes which determine the morphological characteristics of the neoplasm.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Competition for nutrients in a polymicrobial biofilm may lead to susceptible species being subjected to nutritional stress. The influence of bacterial growth rates and interspecies interactions on their susceptibility and response to nutritional stress is not well understood. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are two prevalent causative pathogens that coexist in biofilm-associated infections. Despite being the slower-growing species, P. aeruginosa dominates in a two-species biofilm by inducing phenotypic switching of S. aureus to a metabolically-challenged small colony variant (SCV) via the release of 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (HQNO). We hypothesize that P. aeruginosa experiences nutritional stress in competition with S. aureus, and that the release of HQNO is an adaptive response to nutritional stress. We present an individual-based two-species biofilm model in which interactions between entities induce emergent properties. As the biofilm matured, the difference in growth rates of the two species caused a non-uniform distribution of nutrients leading to nutritional stress for P. aeruginosa and a concurrent increase in the proportion of S. aureus subpopulation. The latter resulted in increased release of autoinducer, and subsequently the upregulation of P. aeruginosa cells via quorum sensing. Upregulated P. aeruginosa cells released HQNO at enhanced rates, thereby inducing phenotypic switching of S. aureus to SCVs which consume nutrient at a reduced rate. This shifted the nutrient distribution back in favor of P. aeruginosa, thereby relieving nutritional stress. Increase in nutritional stress potentiated the transformation of S. aureus into SCVs. HQNO production decreased once nutritional stress was relieved, indicating that phenotypic switching acts as a regulatory stress-adaptive response.",

This process requires a single host to be infected with more than one type of coronavirus, which recombine to form novel strains of virus with unique combinations of genetic material. Identifying possible sources of novel coronaviruses requires identifying hosts (termed recombination hosts) of more than one coronavirus type, in which recombination might occur. However, the majority of coronavirus-host interactions remain unknown, and therefore the vast majority of recombination hosts for coronaviruses cannot be identified. Here we show that there are 11.5-fold more coronavirus-host associations, and over 30-fold more potential SARS-CoV-2 recombination hosts, than have been observed to date. We show there are over 40-fold more host species with four or more different subgenera of coronaviruses.

    "abstract": "Epithelial tissues in many contexts can be viewed as soft active solids. Their active nature is manifested in the ability of individual cells within the tissue to contract and/or remodel their mechanical properties in response to various conditions. Little is known about the emergent properties of such materials. Specifically, how an individual cellular activity gives rise to collective spatiotemporal patterns is not fully understood. Recently we reported the observation of ultrafast contraction pulses in the dorsal epithelium of T.adhaerens in vivo [1] and speculated these propagate via mechanical fields. Other accumulating evidence suggest mechanics is involved in similar contractile patterns in embryonic development in vivo and in cellular monolayers in vitro. Here we show that a widespread cellular response - activation of contraction in response to stretch - is sufficient to give rise to nonlinear propagating contraction pulses. Using a minimal numerical model and theoretical considerations we show how such mechanical pulses emerge and propagate, spontaneously or in response to external stretch. The model - whose mathematical structure resembles that of reaction-diffusion systems - explains observed phenomena in T. adhaerens (e.g. excitable or spontaneous pulses, pulse interaction) and predicts other phenomena (e.g. symmetric strain profile, \"spike trains\"). Finally, we show that in response to external tension, such an active two-dimensional sheet lowers and dynamically distributes the strains across its surface, hence facilitating tissue resistance to rupture. Adding a cellular softening-threshold further enhances the tissue resistance to rupture at cell-cell junctions. As cohesion is at the heart of epithelial physiology, our model may be relevant to many other epithelial systems, even if manifested at different time/length scales.\n\nSignificanceOur work demonstrates that many observed dynamical phenomena in epithelial tissues can be explained merely by mechanical cell-cell interactions, and do not require chemical diffusion or transport between cells (though chemical activity may participate in relevant intracellular processes). Specifically, we show that single cell extension-induced-contraction (EIC) is sufficient to generate propagating contraction pulses, which also increase the tissues resistance to rupture, an essential function of epithelia. Our results may shed light on how epithelial tissues function under challenging physiological conditions, e.g. in lung, gut, vasculature and other biomedical contexts. Our results may also be relevant in the study of early evolution of multicellularity and the nervous-muscular systems. Finally, the work offers guidelines for designing soft synthetic solids with improved mechanical properties.",

We compared three library preparation methods using both tagmentation (Nextera XT and Nextera Flex) and ligation-based (KAPA HyperPrep) approaches on both positive and negative samples to provide insights into any methodological differences between the methods, and validate their use in SARS-CoV-2 amplicon sequencing. We show that all three library preparation methods allow us to recover near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes with identical SNP calls. The Nextera Flex and KAPA library preparation methods gave better coverage than libraries prepared with Nextera XT, which required more reads to call the same number of genomic positions. The KAPA ligation-based approach shows the lowest levels of human contamination, but contaminating reads had no effect on the downstream analysis. We found some examples of library preparation-specific differences in minority variant calling. Overall our data shows that the choice of Illumina library preparation method has minimal effects on consensus base calling and downstream phylogenetic analysis, and suggests that all methods would be suitable for use if specific reagents are difficult to obtain.",

    "abstract": "Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 the etiological agent of COVID-19 disease, have caused multiple epidemic and pandemic outbreaks in the past 20 years1-3. With no vaccines, and only recently developed antiviral therapeutics, we are ill equipped to handle coronavirus outbreaks4. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate coronavirus replication and pathogenesis is needed to guide the development of new antiviral therapeutics and vaccines. RNA secondary structures play critical roles in multiple aspects of coronavirus replication, but the extent and conservation of RNA secondary structure across coronavirus genomes is unknown5. Here, we define highly structured RNA regions throughout the MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We find that highly stable RNA structures are pervasive throughout coronavirus genomes, and are conserved between the SARS-like CoV. Our data suggests that selective pressure helps preserve RNA secondary structure in coronavirus genomes, suggesting that these structures may play important roles in virus replication and pathogenesis. Thus, disruption of conserved RNA secondary structures could be a novel strategy for the generation of attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for use against the current COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Current approaches of drugs repurposing against 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have not proven overwhelmingly successful and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic continues to cause major global mortality. Daclatasvir (DCV) and sofosbuvir (SFV) are clinically approved against hepatitis C virus (HCV), with satisfactory safety profile. DCV and SFV target the HCV enzymes NS5A and NS5B, respectively. NS5A is endowed with pleotropic activities, which overlap with several proteins from SARS-CoV-2. HCV NS5B and SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 are RNA polymerases that share homology in the nucleotide uptake channel. We thus tested whether SARS-COV-2 would be susceptible these anti-HCV drugs. DCV consistently inhibited the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells, in the hepatoma cell line (HuH-7) and in type II pneumocytes (Calu-3), with potencies of 0.8, 0.6 and 1.1 M, respectively. Although less potent than DCV, SFV and its nucleoside metabolite inhibited replication in Calu-3 cells. Moreover, SFV/DCV combination (1:0.15 ratio) inhibited SARS-CoV-2 with EC50 of 0.7:0.1 M in Calu-3 cells. SFV and DCV prevented virus-induced neuronal apoptosis and release of cytokine storm-related inflammatory mediators, respectively. Both drugs inhibited independent events during RNA synthesis and this was particularly the case for DCV, which also targeted secondary RNA structures in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Concentrations required for partial DCV in vitro activity are achieved in plasma at Cmax after administration of the approved dose to humans. Doses higher than those approved may ultimately be required, but these data provide a basis to further explore these agents as COVID-19 antiviral candidates.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal oscillatory neural activity in the basal ganglia is thought to play a pathophysiological role in Parkinsons disease. Many patient studies have focused on beta frequency band (13-35 Hz) local field potential activity in the subthalamic nucleus, however increasing evidence points to alterations in neural oscillations in high frequency ranges (>100 Hz) having pathophysiological relevance. Prior studies have found that power in subthalamic high frequency oscillations (HFOs) is positively correlated with dopamine tone and increased during voluntary movements, implicating these brain rhythms in normal basal ganglia function. Contrary to this idea, in the current study we present a combination of clinical and preclinical data that support the hypothesis that HFOs in the internal globus pallidus (GPi) are a pathophysiological feature of Parkinsons disease. Spontaneous and movement-related pallidal field potentials were recorded from deep brain stimulation (DBS) leads targeting the GPi in five externalized Parkinsons disease patients, on and off dopaminergic medication. We identified a prominent oscillatory peak centered at 200-300 Hz in the off-medication rest recordings in all patients. High frequency power increased during movement, and the magnitude of modulation was negatively correlated with bradykinesia. Moreover, high frequency oscillations were significantly attenuated in the on-medication condition, suggesting they are a feature of the parkinsonian condition. To further confirm that GPi high frequency oscillations are characteristic of dopamine depletion, we also collected field potentials from DBS leads chronically implanted in three rhesus monkeys before and after the induction of parkinsonism with the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). High frequency oscillations and their modulation during movement were not prominent in the normal condition but emerged in the parkinsonian condition in the monkey model. These data provide the first evidence demonstrating that exaggerated, movement-modulated high frequency oscillations in the internal globus pallidus are a pathophysiological feature of Parkinsons disease, and motivate additional investigations into the functional roles of high frequency neural oscillations across the basal ganglia-thalamocortical motor circuit and their relationship to motor control in normal and diseased states. These findings also provide rationale for further exploration of these signals for electrophysiological biomarker-based device programming and stimulation strategies in patients receiving deep brain stimulation therapy.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveNoise reduction algorithms in current hearing devices lack information about the sound source a user attends to when multiple sources are present. To resolve this issue, they can be complemented with auditory attention decoding (AAD) algorithms, which decode the attention using electroencephalography (EEG) sensors. State-of-the-art AAD algorithms employ a stimulus reconstruction approach, in which the envelope of the attended source is reconstructed from the EEG and correlated with the envelopes of the individual sources. This approach, however, performs poorly on short signal segments, while longer segments yield impractically long detection delays when the user switches attention.\n\nMethodsWe propose decoding the directional focus of attention using filterbank common spatial pattern filters (FB-CSP) as an alternative AAD paradigm, which does not require access to the clean source envelopes.\n\nResultsThe proposed FB-CSP approach outperforms both the stimulus reconstruction approach on short signal segments, as well as a convolutional neural network approach on the same task. We achieve a high accuracy (80% for 1 s windows and 70% for quasi-instantaneous decisions), which is sufficient to reach minimal expected switch durations below 4 s. We also demonstrate that the decoder can adapt to unlabeled data from an unseen subject and works with only a subset of EEG channels located around the ear to emulate a wearable EEG setup.\n\nConclusionThe proposed FB-CSP method provides fast and accurate decoding of the directional focus of auditory attention.\n\nSignificanceThe high accuracy on very short data segments is a major step forward towards practical neuro-steered hearing devices.",

    "abstract": "Liquid-liquid phase separation plays important roles in the compartmentalization of cells. Developing an understanding of how phase separation is encoded in biomacromolecules requires quantitative mapping of their phase behavior. Given that such experiments require large quantities of the biomolecule of interest, these efforts have been lagging behind the recent breadth of biological insights. Herein, we present a microfluidic phase chip that enables the measurement of saturation concentrations over at least three orders of magnitude for a broad spectrum of biomolecules and solution conditions. The phase chip consists of five units, each made of twenty individual sample chambers to allow the measurement of five sample conditions simultaneously. The analytes are slowly concentrated via evaporation of water, which is replaced by oil, until the sample undergoes phase separation into a dilute and dense phase. We show that the phase chip lowers the required sample quantity by 98% while offering six-fold better statistics in comparison to standard manual experiments that involve centrifugal separation of dilute and dense phase. We further show that the saturation concentrations measured in chip are in agreement with previously reported data for a variety of biomolecules. Concomitantly, time-dependent changes of the dense phase morphology and potential off-pathway processes, including aggregation, can be monitored microscopically. In summary, the phase chip is suited to exploring sequence-to-binodal relationships by enabling the determination of a large number of saturation concentrations at low protein cost.",

    "abstract": "The widespread of Coronavirus has led to a worldwide pandemic with a high mortality rate. Currently, the knowledge accumulated from different studies about this virus is very limited. Leveraging a wide-range of biological knowledge, such as gene on-tology and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks from other closely related species presents a vital approach to infer the molecular impact of a new species. In this paper, we propose the transferred multi-relational embedding model Bio-JOIE to capture the knowledge of gene ontology and PPI networks, which demonstrates superb capability in modeling the SARS-CoV-2-human protein interactions. Bio-JOIE jointly trains two model components. The knowledge model encodes the relational facts from the protein and GO domains into separated embedding spaces, using a hierarchy-aware encoding technique employed for the GO terms. On top of that, the transfer model learns a non-linear transformation to transfer the knowledge of PPIs and gene ontology annotations across their embedding spaces. By leveraging only structured knowledge, Bio-JOIE significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in PPI type prediction on multiple species. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the potential of leveraging the learned representations on clustering proteins with enzymatic function into enzyme commission families. Finally, we show that Bio-JOIE can accurately identify PPIs between the SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins, providing valuable insights for advancing research on this new disease.",

Here, we investigated interactions of BCC with macrophages in 2D and 3D. BCC did not show chemotaxis to macrophages in custom designed 3D cell-on-a-chip devices, which was in agreement with ELISA results showing that macrophage-derived-EGF was not secreted into macrophage-conditioned-medium. Live cell imaging of BCC in the presence and absence of iressa showed that macrophages but not macrophage-derived-matrix modulated adhesion and motility of BCC in 2D. 3D co-culture experiments in collagen and matrigel showed that BCC changed their multicellular organization in the presence of macrophages. In custom designed 3D co-culture cell-on-a-chip devices, macrophages promoted and reduced migration of BCC in collagen and matrigel, respectively. Furthermore, adherent but not suspended BCC endocytosed EGFR when in contact with macrophages. Collectively, our data revealed that macrophages showed chemotaxis towards BCC whereas BCC required direct contact to interact with macrophage-derived-EGF.

In Xenopus embryos and extracts it is driven by the activation of a bistable trigger circuit, whose various components are localized in the nucleus, centrosome, and cytoplasm. In principle, whichever cellular location has the fastest intrinsic rhythm should act as a pacemaker for the process. Here we followed tubulin polymerization and depolymerization in Xenopus egg extracts supplemented with demembranated sperm, and thereby identified locations where mitosis first occurred. We found that mitosis was commonly first initiated at sperm-derived nuclei and their accompanying centrosomes, and then spread outward in circular trigger waves. The cell cycle was [~]20% more rapid at the nucleus/centrosome-associated trigger wave sources than in the regions of the extract that appeared not to be entrained by trigger waves. Nuclei produced from phage DNA, which did not possess centrosomes, also acted as trigger wave sources, but purified centrosomes in the absence of nuclei did not. We conclude that the nucleus accelerates mitotic entry and propose that it acts as a pacemaker for cell cycle.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryStudies in cycling Xenopus egg extracts show that mitosis first occurs in the nucleus and then spreads outward through the cytoplasm in circular trigger waves.",

In this study, fatty acids and parasitism at different reproductive and feeding stages in these two species were assessed using specimens caught along the northern Catalan coast, in order to assess the links between lipid dynamics, reproduction and feeding in these two species, and to contribute towards an explanation of the potential causes of the current situation of the stocks. The results support the use of fatty acid levels as indicators of the body condition of sardine and anchovy at different reproductive and feeding stages, as well as that of the pelagic environmental conditions. In particular, the relatively low n-3 PUFA levels (which are crucial for reproductive success) found in spawning sardines compared to spawning anchovies indicate a poorer reproductive health status of sardine. By comparing the current total lipid content values with those recorded in other Mediterranean and North Atlantic areas, and, others from more than ten years ago, in the adjacent area of the Gulf of Lion, our study reveals the persistent poor condition of sardine and anchovy in the northern Catalan Sea. Furthermore, the low levels of diatom fatty acid markers observed throughout the spawning and non-spawning seasons in both sardine and anchovy, indicate a diet poor in diatoms. Moreover, the results indicate that it is very unlikely that parasitism is a significant factor in the decline in condition of sardine and anchovy in the northern Catalan Sea. In fact, the results suggest that the current poor condition of sardine and anchovy in the northern Catalan Sea has been exacerbated by a decrease in plankton productivity and/or a shift in the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton communities, adding to the ongoing effects of overfishing.",

    "abstract": "Natural populations are constantly exposed to fluctuating environmental changes that negatively affect their fitness in unpredictable ways. While theoretical models show the possibility of counteracting these environmental changes through rapid evolutionary adaptations, there have been few empirical studies demonstrating such adaptive tracking in natural populations.\n\nHere, we analysed environmental data, fitness-related phenotyping and genomic time-series data sampled over three years from a natural Chironomus riparius (Diptera, Insecta) population to address this question. We show that the populations environment varied significantly on the time scale of the sampling in many selectively relevant dimensions, independently of each other. Similarly, phenotypic fitness components evolved significantly on the same temporal scale (mean 0.32 Haldanes), likewise independent from each other. The allele frequencies of 367,446 SNPs across the genome showed evidence of positive selection. Using temporal correlation of spatially coherent allele frequency changes revealed 35,574 haplotypes with more than one selected SNP. The mean selection coefficient for these haplotypes was 0.30 (s.d. = 0.68). The frequency changes of these haplotypes clustered in 46 different temporal patterns, indicating concerted, independent evolution of many polygenic traits. Nine of these patterns were strongly correlated with measured environmental variables.\n\nThus, our results suggest that the natural population of C. riparius tracks environmental change through rapid polygenic adaptation in many independent dimensions. This is further evidence that natural selection is pervasive at the genomic level and that evolutionary and ecological time scales may not differ at all, at least in some organisms.",

    "abstract": "Booming and busting populations modulate the accumulation of genetic diversity, encoding histories of living populations in present-day variation. Many methods exist to decode these histories, and all must make strong model assumptions. It is typical to assume that mutations accumulate uniformly across the genome at a constant rate that does not vary between closely related populations. However, recent work shows that mutational processes in human and great ape populations vary across genomic regions and evolve over time. This perturbs the mutation spectrum: the relative mutation rates in different local nucleotide contexts. Here, we develop theoretical tools in the framework of Kingmans coalescent to accommodate mutation spectrum dynamics. We describe mushi: a method to perform fast, nonparametric joint inference of demographic and mutation spectrum histories from allele frequency data. We use mushi to reconstruct trajectories of effective population size and mutation spectrum divergence between human populations, identify mutation signatures and their dynamics in different human populations, and produce more accurate time calibration for a previously-reported mutational pulse in the ancestors of Europeans. We show that mutation spectrum histories can be productively incorporated in a well-studied theoretical setting, and rigorously inferred from genomic variation data like other features of evolutionary history.",

SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to survive on inanimate surfaces for several days, yet the factors that determine its survival on surfaces are not well understood. Here we combine microscopy imaging with virus viability assays to study survival of three bacteriophages suggested as good models for human respiratory pathogens: the enveloped Phi6 (a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2), and the non-enveloped PhiX174 and MS2. We measured virus viability in human saliva microdroplets, SM buffer, and water following deposition on glass surfaces at various relative humidities (RH). Although saliva microdroplets dried out rapidly at all tested RH levels (unlike SM that remained hydrated at RH [&ge;] 57%), survival of all three viruses in dry saliva microdroplets was significantly higher than in water or SM. Thus, RH and hydration conditions are not sufficient to explain virus survival, indicating that the suspended medium, and association with saliva components in particular, likely affect physicochemical properties that determine virus survival. The observed high virus survival in dry saliva deposited on surfaces, under a wide range of RH levels, can have profound implications for human public health, specifically the COVID-19 pandemic.",

We find that Cdc48 accumulates during cellular stress at intranuclear protein quality control (INQ) sites. Cdc48 function is required to suppress INQ formation under non-stress conditions and to promote recovery following genotoxic stress. Cdc48 physically associates with the INQ substrate and splicing factor Hsh155 and regulates its assembly with partner proteins. Accordingly, cdc48 mutants have defects in splicing and show spontaneous distribution of Hsh155 to INQ aggregates where it is stabilized. Overall, this study shows that Cdc48 regulates deposition of proteins at INQ and suggests a previously unknown role for Cdc48 in the regulation or stability of splicing subcomplexes.",

Here, we studied how motor augmentation with an extra robotic thumb (the Third Thumb) impacts the biological hand representation in the brains of able-bodied people. Participants were tested on a variety of behavioural and neuroimaging tests designed to interrogate the augmented hands representation before and after 5-days of semi-intensive training. Training improved the Thumbs motor control, dexterity and hand-robot coordination, even when cognitive load was increased or when vision was occluded, and resulted in increased sense of embodiment over the robotic Thumb. Thumb usage also weakened natural kinematic hand synergies. Importantly, brain decoding of the augmented hands motor representation demonstrated mild collapsing of the canonical hand structure following training, suggesting that motor augmentation may disrupt the biological hand representation. Together, our findings unveil critical neurocognitive considerations for designing human body augmentation.",

    "abstract": "Our senses often receive conflicting multisensory information, which our brain reconciles by adaptive recalibration. A classic example is the ventriloquist aftereffect, which emerges following both long-term and trial-wise exposure to spatially discrepant multisensory stimuli. Still, it remains debated whether the behavioral biases observed following short- and long-term exposure arise from largely the same or rather distinct neural origins, and hence reflect the same or distinct mechanisms. We address this question by probing EEG recordings for physiological processes predictive of the single-trial ventriloquism biases following the exposure to spatially offset audio-visual stimuli. Our results support the hypothesis that both short- and long-term aftereffects are mediated by common neurophysiological correlates, which likely arise from sensory and parietal regions involved in multisensory inference and memory, while prolonged exposure to consistent discrepancies additionally recruits prefrontal regions. These results posit a central role of parietal regions in mediating multisensory spatial recalibration and suggest that frontal regions contribute to increasing the behavioral bias when the perceived sensory discrepancy is consistent and persistent over time.",

    "abstract": "An effective method to modulate the stability of proteins is essential to biological research. Herein, we describe a new technology that allows conditional stabilization of proteins based on masking of a degron tag by a specific intracellular protein cue. A target protein is fused to a degron tag and an affinity sensor domain. When the sensor detects its target protein, the degron is effectively concealed and the target protein is rescued. By introducing nanobodies as the sensor, we allow for virtually any endogenous protein to be targeted. In a model system using yeast cytosine deaminase, we demonstrate low cell death background yet maintain the ability to elicit strong activation and prodrug-mediated cell killing using GFP as the rescue protein. The flexibility in choosing different masking targets provides a straightforward method to generalize the strategy for conditional protein rescue in a wide range of biological contexts, including oncoprotein detection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Changes in protein and gene expression levels are often used as features to predictive models such as survival prediction. A common strategy to aggregate information on individual proteins is to integrate the expression information with biological networks. We propose a novel patient representation in this work where we integrate proteins expression levels with the protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Patient representation with PRER (Pairwise Relative Expressions with Random walks) uses the neighborhood of a protein to capture the dysregulation patterns in protein abundance. Specifically, PRER computes a feature vector for a patient by comparing the source proteins protein expression level with other proteins levels in its neighborhood. This neighborhood of the source protein is derived using a biased random-walk strategy on the network. We test PRERs performance through a survival prediction task in 10 different cancers using random forest survival models. PRER representation yields a statistically significant predictive performance in 9 out of 10 cancer types when compared to a representation based on individual protein expression. We also identify important proteins that are not important in the models trained with the expression values but emerge as predictive in models trained with PRER features. The set of identified relations provides a valuable collection of biomarkers with high prognostic value. PRER representation can be used for other complex diseases and prediction tasks that use molecular expression profiles as input. PRER is freely available at: https://github.com/hikuru/PRER",

    "abstract": "The direct electrochemistry of hemoglobin (Hb) immobilized on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) by mixing with a hybrid dispersion of self-assembling peptide EFK8 and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) was investigated and shown to have effective properties as a biosensor for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Preliminary experiments involving cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) showed that the presence of SWNTs in the modifying peptide layer on GCE significantly enhanced the electrochemical response of the electrode for the ferricyanide/ferrocyanide redox couple. Also, when more layers of the peptide-SWNT dispersion were applied to the surface, the electrochemical response of the GCE was further increased. This behavior was then exploited to fabricate a biosensor for H2O2 by mixing hemoglobin with the hybrid peptide-SWNT dispersion and casting this mixture on a glassy carbon electrode. AFM imaging, CV and EIS analysis revealed successful immobilization of Hb on the electrode and the ability of the electrode to enable direct electron transfer from Hb to the electrode surface. In particular, CVs obtained in 0.1M PBS (pH 7.0) showed that the immobilized Hb retained its bio-catalytic activity for Fe ions, indicating that it had not denatured and the hybrid layer remained biocompatible with Hb. Furthermore, this electrode was found to accurately measure the H2O2 concentration over the range from 20 to 9.6x102 M in 0.1M PBS (pH 7.0) under mediatorless conditions using both CV and amperometry techniques. In this way, the EFK8-SWNT hybrid layer shows promise as a biocompatible layer for simple non-covalent enzyme immobilization and the basis of a mediatorless biosensor.",

    "abstract": "Anosmia is one of the most prevalent symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the cellular mechanism behind the sudden loss of smell has not yet been investigated. The initial step of odour detection takes place in the pseudostratified olfactory epithelium (OE) mainly composed of olfactory sensory neurons surrounded by supporting cells known as sustentacular cells. The olfactory neurons project their axons to the olfactory bulb in the central nervous system offering a potential pathway for pathogens to enter the central nervous system by bypassing the blood brain barrier. In the present study, we explored the impact of SARS-COV-2 infection on the olfactory system in golden Syrian hamsters. We observed massive damage of the OE as early as 2 days post nasal instillation of SARS-CoV-2, resulting in a major loss of cilia necessary for odour detection. These damages were associated with infection of a large proportion of sustentacular cells but not of olfactory neurons, and we did not detect any presence of the virus in the olfactory bulbs. We observed massive infiltration of immune cells in the OE and lamina propria of infected animals, which may contribute to the desquamation of the OE. The OE was partially restored 14 days post infection. Anosmia observed in COVID-19 patient is therefore likely to be linked to a massive and fast desquamation of the OE following sustentacular cells infection with SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent recruitment of immune cells in the OE and lamina propria.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesTwo of the main target tissues of SARS-coronavirus 2 are the oral cavity pharynx-larynx epithelium, the main virus entry site, and the lung epithelium. The virus enters host cells through binding of the Spike protein to ACE2 receptor and subsequent S priming by the TMPRSS2 protease. Herein we aim to assess differences in both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in normal tissues from oral cavity-pharynx-larynx and lung tissues as well as neoplastic tissues from the same histological areas. The information provided in this study may contribute to better understanding of SARS-coronavirus 2 ability to interact with different biological systems and contributes to cumulative knowledge on potential mechanisms to inhibit its diffusion.\n\nMaterials and MethodsThe study has been conducted using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Regina Elena Institute (IRE) databases and validated by experimental model in HNSCC and Lung cancer cells. Data from one COVID19 positive patient who was operated on for HNSCC was also included. We have analyzed 478 tumor samples and 44 normal samples from TCGA HNSCC cohort for whom both miRNA and mRNA sequencing was available. The dataset included 391 HPV- and 85 HPV+ cases, with 331 P53 mutated and 147 P53 wild type cases respectively. 352 out of 478 samples were male and 126 female. In IRE cohort we analyzed 66 tumor samples with matched normal sample for miRNA profiling and 23 tumor\\normal matched samples for mRNA profiling. 45 out of 66 tumors from IRE cohort were male and 21 female, 38 were P53 mutated and 27 wild type. Most patients (63 of 66) in IRE cohort were HPV negative. Normalized TCGA HNSCC gene expression and miRNA expression data were obtained from Broad Institute TCGA Genome Data Analysis Center (http://gdac.broadinstitute.org/). mRNA expression data from IRE cohort used in this study has been deposited to NCBIs Gene Expression Omnibus and is accessible through GEO series accession number GSE107591. In order to inference about potential molecular modulation of TMPRSS2, we also included miRNAs expression for the 66 IRE cohort matched tumor and normal samples from Agilent platform. DNA methylation data for TCGA tumors were obtained from Wanderer (http://maplab.imppc.org/wanderer/). We used miRWalk and miRNet web tools for miRNA-target interaction prediction and pathway enrichment analysis. The correlation and regression analyses as well as the miRNA and gene modulation and the survival analysis were conducted using Matlab R2019.\n\nResultsTMPRSS2 expression in HNSCC was significantly reduced compared to the normal tissues and had a prognostic value in HNSCC patients. Reduction of TMPRSS2 expression was more evident in women than in men, in TP53 mutated versus wild TP53 tumors as well as in HPV negative patients compared to HPV positive counterparts. Functionally, we assessed the multivariate effect on TMPRSS2 in a single regression model. We observed that all variables had an independent effect on TMPRSS2 in HNSCC patients with HPV negative, TP53 mutated status and with elevated TP53-dependent Myc-target genes associated with low TMPRSS2 expression. Investigation of the molecular modulation of TMPRSS2 in both HNSCC and lung cancers revealed that expression of microRNAs targeting TMPRSS2 anti-correlated in both TCGA and IRE HNSCC datasets, while there was not evidence of TMPRSS2 promoter methylation in both tumor cohorts. Interestingly, the anti-correlation between microRNAs and TMPRSS2 expression was corroborated by testing this association in a SARS-CoV-2 positive HNSCC patient.\n\nConclusionsCollectively, these findings suggest that tumoral tissues, herein exemplified by HNSCC and lung cancers might be more resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to reduced expression of TMPRSS2. The protective mechanism might occur, at least partially, through the aberrant activation of TMPRSS2 targeting microRNAs; thereby providing strong evidence on the role of non-coding RNA molecule in host viral infection. These observations may help to better assess the frailty of SARS-CoV-2 positive cancer patients.",

Previous studies have discovered a group of MM-associated potential biomarkers in MSCs derived from bone marrow (BM-MSCs). However, no study of the bioinformatics analysis was conducted to explore the key genes and pathways of MSCs derived from adipose (AD-MSCs) in MM. The aim of this study was to screen potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets of AD-MSCs and BM-MSCs in MM.\n\nMethodsThe gene expression profiles of AD-MSCs (GSE133346) and BM-MSCs (GSE36474) were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Gene Oncology (GO) enrichment, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were performed.\n\nResultsA total of 456 common downregulated DEGs in two datasets were identified and the remaining DEGs in GSE133346 were further identified as specific DEGs of AD-MSCs. Furthermore, a PPI network of common downregulated DEGs was constructed and seven hub genes were identified. Importantly, cell cycle was the most significantly enrichment pathway both in AD-MSCs and BM-MSCs from MM patients.\n\nConclusionWe identified key genes and pathways closely related with MM progression, which may act as potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets of MM.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal function relies on careful coordination of organelle organization and transport. Kinesin-1 mediates transport of the ER and lysosomes into the axon and it is increasingly recognized that contacts between the ER and lysosomes influence organelle organization. However, it is unclear how organelle organization, inter-organelle communication and transport are linked and how this contributes to local organelle availability in neurons. Here, we show that somatic ER tubules are required for proper lysosome transport into the axon. Somatic ER tubule disruption causes accumulation of enlarged and less motile lysosomes at the soma. ER tubules regulate lysosome size and axonal translocation by promoting lysosome homo-fission. ER tubule - lysosome contacts often occur at a somatic pre-axonal region, where the kinesin-1-binding ER-protein P180 binds microtubules to promote kinesin-1-powered lysosome fission and subsequent axonal translocation. We propose that ER tubule - lysosome contacts at a pre-axonal region finely orchestrate axonal lysosome availability for proper neuronal function.",

    "abstract": "Animals living at high population densities commonly experience greater exposure to disease, leading to increased parasite burdens. However, social animals can benefit immunologically and hygienically from cooperation, and individuals may alter their socio-spatial behaviour in response to infection, both of which could counteract density-related increases in exposure. Consequently, the costs and benefits of sociality for disease are often uncertain. Here, we use a long-term study of a wild European badger population (Meles meles) to investigate how within-population variation in host density determines infection with multiple parasites. Four out of five parasite taxa exhibited consistent spatial hotspots of infection, which peaked among badgers living in areas of low local population density. Combined movement, survival, spatial, and social network analyses revealed that parasite avoidance was the likely cause of this negative density dependence, with possible roles for localised mortality, encounter-dilution effects, and micronutrient-enhanced immunity. These findings demonstrate that animals can organise their societies in space to minimise parasite infection, with important implications for badger behavioural ecology and for the control of badger-associated diseases.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major human pathogen that can cause severe invasive diseases such as pneumonia, septicaemia and meningitis. Young children are at a particularly high risk, with an estimated half a million deaths worldwide in those under five attributable to invasive pneumococcal disease each year. The cytolytic toxin pneumolysin (Ply) is a primary virulence factor for this bacterium, yet despite its key role in pathogenesis, immune evasion, and transmission, the regulation of Ply production is not well defined. Using a genome-wide association approach we identified a large number of potential affectors of Ply activity, including a gene acquired horizontally on the antibiotic resistance conferring Integrative and Conjugative Element (ICE) ICESp23FST81. This gene encodes a novel modular protein, ZomB, which has an N-terminal UvrD-like helicase domain followed by two Cas4-like domains with potent ATP-dependent nuclease activity. We found the regulatory effect of ZomB to be specific for the ply operon, potentially mediated by its high affinity for the BOX repeats encoded therein. Using a murine model of pneumococcal colonisation, we further demonstrate that a ZomB mutant strain colonises both the upper respiratory tract and lungs at higher levels when compared to the wild type strain. While the antibiotic resistance conferring aspects of ICESp23FST81 is often credited with contributing to the success of the S. pneumoniae lineages that acquire it, its ability to control the expression of a major virulence factor implicated in bacterial transmission is also likely to have played an important role.",

    "abstract": "When viewed cross-sectionally, aging seems to negatively affect speech comprehension. However, aging is a heterogeneous process, and variability among older adults is typically large. In this study, we investigated language comprehension as a function of individual differences in older adults. Specifically, we tested whether hearing thresholds, working memory, inhibition, and individual alpha frequency would predict event-related potential amplitudes in response to classic psycholinguistic manipulations at the sentence level. Twenty-nine healthy older adults (age range 61-76 years) listened to English sentences containing reduced relative clauses and object-relative clauses while their electroencephalogram was recorded. We found that hearing thresholds and working memory predicted P600 amplitudes early during reduced relative clause processing, while individual alpha frequency predicted P600 amplitudes at a later point in time. The results suggest that participants with better hearing and larger working memory capacity simultaneously activated both the preferred and the dispreferred interpretation of reduced relative clauses, while participants with worse hearing and smaller working memory capacity only activated the preferred interpretation. They also suggest that participants with a higher individual alpha frequency had a higher likelihood of successfully reanalysing the sentence towards the reduced relative clause reading than participants with a lower individual alpha frequency. By contrast, we found no relationship between object-relative clause processing and working memory or hearing thresholds. Taken together, the results support the view that older adults employ different strategies during auditory sentence processing dependent on their hearing and cognitive abilities and that there is no single ability that uniformly predicts sentence processing outcomes.",

How placental lateral growth is related to spiral artery remodeling in spatiotemporal fashion is to be investigated.Design The central and peripheral portions of 105 placentas with decidual vasculopathy at term were examined with or without preeclampsia to see if temporal vascular regeneration was present. Central and peripheral vasculopathy and central and peripheral regeneration were compared.Result Peripheral portion showed more decidual vasculopathy (88 of total 105, 83.8%) than central portion (72 of total 105, 68.6%, p=0.0018). However, central portion showed more vascular regeneration (51 of total 105, 48.6%) than peripheral portion (23 of total 105, 21.9%, p=0.0024). There is no difference in vasculopathy or regeneration with or without preeclampsia.Conclusion Spiral artery remodeling is non-synchronous during lateral growth and vascular regeneration.

    "abstract": "Burkholderia is a genus of diverse Gram-negative bacteria that includes several opportunistic pathogens. Siderophores, which transport iron from the environment into microbial cells, are important virulence factors in most pathogenic Burkholderia species. However, it is widely believed that Burkholderia gladioli, which can infect the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) sufferers, does not produce siderophores. B. gladioli BCC0238, isolated from the lung of a CF patient, produces two novel metabolites in a minimal medium containing glycerol and ribose as carbon sources. HPLC purification, followed by detailed spectroscopic analyses, identified these metabolites as unusual lipodepsipeptides containing a unique citrate-derived fatty acid and a rare dehydro-{beta}-alanine residue. The absolute configurations of the amino acid residues in the two metabolites was elucidated using Marfeys method and the gene cluster responsible for their biosynthesis was identified by bioinformatics and insertional mutagenesis. In-frame deletions and enzyme activity assays were used to investigate the functions of several proteins encoded by the biosynthetic gene cluster, which was found in the genomes of most B. gladioli isolates, suggesting that its metabolic products play an important role in the growth and/or survival of the species. The Chrome Azurol S (CAS) assay showed the metabolites bind ferric iron and that this supresses their production when added to the growth medium. Moreover, a gene encoding a TonB-dependent ferric-siderophore receptor is adjacent to the biosynthetic genes. Together, these observations suggest that these metabolites likely function as siderophores in B. gladioli.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) constitute a large fraction of plant genomes and are mostly present in a transcriptionally silent state through repressive epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation. TE silencing is believed to influence the regulation of adjacent genes, possibly as DNA methylation spreads away from the TE. Whether this is a general principle or a context-dependent phenomenon is still under debate, pressing for studying the relationship between TEs, DNA methylation and nearby gene expression in additional plant species. Here we used the grass Brachypodium distachyon as a model and produced DNA methylation and transcriptome profiles for eleven natural accessions. In contrast to what is observed in Arabidopsis thaliana, we found that TEs have a limited impact on methylation spreading and that only few TE families are associated to a low expression of their adjacent genes. Interestingly, we found that a subset of TE insertion polymorphisms is associated with differential gene expression across accessions. Thus, although not having a global impact on gene expression, distinct TE insertions may contribute to specific gene expression patterns in B. distachyon.\n\nSignificance statementTransposable elements (TEs) are a major component of plant genomes and a source of genetic and epigenetic innovations underlying adaptation to changing environmental conditions. Yet molecular evidence linking TE silencing and nearby gene expression are lacking for many plant species. We show that in the model grass Brachypodium DNA methylation spreads over very short distances around TEs, with an influence on gene expression for a small subset of TE families.",

    "abstract": "This paper analyses the conditions for local adaptation in a metapopulation with infinitely many islands under a model of hard selection, where population size depends on local fitness. Each island belongs to one of two distinct ecological niches or habitats. Fitness is influenced by an additive trait which is under habitat-dependent directional selection. Our analysis is based on the diffusion approximation and accounts for both genetic drift and demographic stochasticity. By neglecting linkage disequilibria, it yields the joint distribution of allele frequencies and population size on each island. We find that under hard selection, the conditions for local adaptation in a rare habitat are more restrictive for more polygenic traits: even moderate migration load per locus at very many loci is sufficient for population sizes to decline. This further reduces the efficacy of selection at individual loci due to increased drift and because smaller populations are more prone to swamping due to migration, causing a positive feedback between increasing maladaptation and declining population sizes. Our analysis also highlights the importance of demographic stochasticity, which exacerbates the decline in numbers of maladapted populations, leading to population collapse in the rare habitat at significantly lower migration than predicted by deterministic arguments.",

    "abstract": "Visual processing in the retina has been studied in great detail at all levels such that a comprehensive picture of the retinas cell types and the many neural circuits they form is emerging. However, the currently best performing models of retinal func{-}tion are black-box CNN models which are agnostic to such biological knowledge. In particular, these models typically neglect the role of the many inhibitory circuits involving amacrine cells and the biophysical mechanisms underlying synaptic release. Here, we present a computational model of temporal processing in the inner retina, including inhibitory feedback circuits and realistic synaptic release mechanisms. Fit to the responses of bipolar cells, the model generalized well to new stimuli including natural movie sequences, performing on par with or better than a benchmark black-box model. In pharmacology experiments, the model replicated in silico the effect of blocking specific amacrine cell populations with high fidelity, indicating that it had learned key circuit functions. Also, more in depth comparisons showed that connectivity patterns learned by the model were well matched to connectivity patterns extracted from connectomics data. Thus, our model provides a biologically interpretable data-driven account of temporal processing in the inner retina, filling the gap between purely black-box and detailed biophysical modeling.",

The brain integrates movements with the resulting tactile signals to form a holistic representation of object identity. We developed a shape discrimination task that challenged head-fixed mice to discriminate concave from convex shapes. Behavioral decoding revealed that mice did this by comparing contacts across whiskers. In contrast, mice performing a shape detection task simply summed up contacts over whiskers. We recorded populations of neurons in the barrel cortex, which processes whisker input, to identify how it encoded the corresponding sensorimotor variables. Neurons across the cortical layers encoded touch, whisker motion, and task-related signals. Sensory representations were task-specific: during shape discrimination, neurons responded most robustly to behaviorally relevant whiskers, overriding somatotopy. We suggest a similar dynamic modulation may underlie object recognition in other brain areas and species.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a pressing public health emergency garnering rapid response from scientists across the globe. Host cell invasion is initiated through direct binding of the viral spike protein to the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Disrupting the spike-ACE2 interaction is a potential therapeutic target for treating COVID-19. We have developed a proximity-based AlphaLISA assay to measure binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) to ACE2. Utilizing this assay platform, a drug-repurposing screen against 3,384 small molecule drugs and pre-clinical compounds was performed, yielding 25 high-quality, small-molecule hits that can be evaluated in cell-based models. This established AlphaLISA RBD-ACE2 platform can facilitate evaluation of biologics or small molecules that can perturb this essential viral-host interaction to further the development of interventions to address the global health pandemic.",

The results showed that the most common mutation sites of SARS-CoV-2 proteins were located on the non-structural protein ORF1ab and the structural protein Spike. Further analysis revealed mutations in cross-reactive epitopes between SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronavirus may help SARS-CoV-2 to escape cellular immunity under the long-term and large-scale community transmission. Meanwhile, the mutations on Spike protein may enhance the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host cells and escape the recognition of B-cell immunity. This study will increase the understanding of the evolutionary direction and warn about the potential immune escape ability of SARS-CoV-2, which may provide important guidance for the potential vaccine design.",

Drug repurposing is one of the most rapid strategies for addressing this need and numerous compounds have been selected for in vitro testing by several groups already. These have led to a growing database of molecules with in vitro activity against the virus. Machine learning models can assist drug discovery through prediction of the best compounds based on previously published data. Herein we have implemented several machine learning methods to develop predictive models from recent SARS-CoV-2 in vitro inhibition data and used them to prioritize additional FDA approved compounds for in vitro testing selected from our in-house compound library. From the compounds predicted with a Bayesian machine learning model, CPI1062 and CPI1155 showed antiviral activity in HeLa-ACE2 cell-based assays and represent potential repurposing opportunities for COVID-19.

    "abstract": "To understand the difference between benign and severe outcomes after Coronavirus infection, we urgently need ways to clarify and quantify the time course of tissue and immune responses. Here we re-analyze 72-hour time-series microarrays generated in 2013 by Sims and collaborators for SARS-CoV-1 in vitro infection of a human lung epithelial cell line. Transcriptograms, a Bioinformatics tool to analyze genome-wide gene expression data, allow us to define an appropriate context-dependent threshold for mechanistic relevance of gene differential expression. Without knowing in advance which genes are relevant, classical analyses detect every gene with statistically-significant differential expression, leaving us with too many genes and hypotheses to be useful. Using a Transcriptogram-based top-down approach, we identified three major, differentially-expressed gene sets comprising 219 mainly immune-response-related genes. We identified timescales for alterations in mitochondrial activity, signaling and transcription regulation of the innate and adaptive immune systems and their relationship to viral titer. At the individual-gene level, EGR3 was significantly upregulated in infected cells. Similar activation in T-cells and fibroblasts in infected lung could explain the T-cell anergy and eventual fibrosis seen in SARS-CoV-1 infection. The methods can be applied to RNA data sets for SARS-CoV-2 to investigate the origin of differential responses in different tissue types, or due to immune or preexisting conditions or to compare cell culture, organoid culture, animal models, and human-derived samples.",

The recently discovered fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal), has resulted in a surge of experimental investigations because of its potential to impact global salamander biodiversity. However, variation in experimental methodologies could thwart knowledge advancement by introducing confounding factors that make comparisons difficult among studies. Thus, our objective was to evaluate if variation in experimental methods changed inferences made on the pathogenicity of Bsal. We tested whether passage duration of Bsal culture, exposure method of the host to Bsal (water bath vs. skin inoculation), Bsal culturing method (liquid vs. plated), host husbandry conditions (aquatic vs. terrestrial), and skin swabbing frequency influenced diseased-induced mortality in a susceptible host species, the eastern newt (Notophthalmus viridescens). We found that disease-induced mortality was faster for eastern newts when exposed to a low passage isolate, when newts were housed in terrestrial environments, and if exposure to zoospores occurred via water bath. We did not detect differences in disease-induced mortality between culturing methods or swabbing frequencies. Our results illustrate the need to standardize methods among Bsal experiments; we provide suggestions for future experiments in the context of hypothesis testing.",

To overcome the problems associated with AZM, an inclusion complex employing a modified cyclodextrin i.e., sulfobutylether-{beta}-cyclodextrin (SBE-{beta}-CD) was prepared and characterized by phase solubility studies, pXRD and FTIR techniques. The results portrayed the formation of the inclusion complex of AZM with sulfobutylether {beta}-cyclodextrin (SBE-{beta}-CD) in 1:2 molar stoichiometric ratios. This inclusion complex was later incorporated into a polymer matrix to prepare an in situ gel. Various combinations of carbopol 934P and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC K4M) polymers were used and evaluated by rheological and in vitro drug release studies. The optimized formulation (F4), containing carbopol 934P 0.2% (w/v) and HPMC K4M 0.2% (w/v), was evaluated for clarity, pH, gelling capacity, drug content, rheological properties, in vitro drug release pattern, ocular irritation test and antimicrobial efficacy.

    "abstract": "Lyme disease patients would benefit greatly from a timely, sensitive and specific molecular diagnostic test that can detect the causal agent, Borrelia burgdorferi, at the onset of symptoms. Currently available diagnostic methods recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for Lyme disease, involve indirect serological tests that rely on the detection of a host-antibody response which often takes more than three weeks to develop. This results in non-detection of many genuine cases on a timely basis, preventing complete cure. In this study we have developed a digital PCR (polymerase chain reaction) assay that detects Lyme disease on clinical presentation at twice the sensitivity of the currently available diagnostic methods, using a cohort of patient samples collected from the Lyme disease endemic state of Connecticut, USA in 2016-2018. Digital PCR technology was chosen as it is more advanced and sensitive than other PCR techniques in detecting rare targets and the lower limit of detection of this diagnostic assay was found to be three genome copies of B. burgdorferi. The paucity of spirochetes in the bloodstream of Lyme disease patients that hinders the clinical adoption of PCR-based diagnostic tests, was overcome by using a comparatively larger sample volume, pre-analytical processing of blood samples and a pre-amplification step to enrich for B. burgdorferi-specific gene targets before using the digital PCR technology to analyze patient samples. Pre-analytical processing of blood samples from acute patients revealed that the best sample type for Lyme disease detection is platelet-rich plasma and not whole blood. If detected on time, Lyme disease can be cured completely limiting the overuse of antibiotics and associated morbidities.",

This study was designed to establish rat models of dual stress using noise and restraint in order to investigate the effect of -GPC on cognitive function and neurogenesis after dual stress. The rats were randomly divided into four groups as follows: a control group (CG), a control with -GPC group (CDG), a noise-restraint stress group (NRSG), and a noise-restraint stress with -GPC group (NRSDG). Two experimental groups were exposed to the double stress stimuli of noise and restraint, which involved 110dB sound pressure level (SPL) white band noise and restraint at the same time for 3 hours/day for 7 days. While the CG and NRSG received saline, the CDG and NRSDG received -GPC (400mg/kg) orally after stress exposure. The -GPC-treated group showed increased memory function compared to the dual stress group in the novel object recognition test. In analysis of the hippocampus, the -GPC-treated group showed greater Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and BDNF expression compared to the dual stress group. The -GPC-treated group showed significantly increased neuroblast expression compared to the dual stress group, which suggests that -GPC enhances BDNF expression and protects the activity of the immature cells at the dentate gyrus. Our results suggest that -GPC treatment can protect cognitive function and neurogenesis in a dual stress model.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a hybrid two-dimensional multiscale model of angiogenesis, the process by which endothelial cells (ECs) migrate from a pre-existing vascular bed in response to local environmental cues and cell-cell interactions, to create a new vascular network. Recent experimental studies have highlighted a central role of cell rearrangements in the formation of angiogenic networks. Our model accounts for this phenomenon via the heterogeneous response of ECs to their microenvironment. These cell rearrangements, in turn, dynamically remodel the local environment. The model reproduces characteristic features of angiogenic sprouting that include branching, chemotactic sensitivity, the brush border effect, and cell mixing. These properties, rather than being hardwired into the model, emerge naturally from the gene expression patterns of individual cells. After calibrating and validating our model against experimental data, we use it to predict how the structure of the vascular network changes as the baseline gene expression levels of the VEGF-Delta-Notch pathway, and the composition of the extracellular environment, vary. In order to investigate the impact of cell rearrangements on the vascular network structure, we introduce the mixing measure, a scalar metric that quantifies cell mixing as the vascular network grows. We calculate the mixing measure for the simulated vascular networks generated by ECs of different lineages (wild type cells and mutant cells with impaired expression of a specific receptor). Our results show that the time evolution of the mixing measure is directly correlated to the generic features of the vascular branching pattern, thus, supporting the hypothesis that cell rearrangements play an essential role in sprouting angiogenesis. Furthermore, we predict that lower cell rearrangement leads to an imbalance between branching and sprout elongation. Since the computation of this statistic requires only individual cell trajectories, it can be computed for networks generated in biological experiments, making it a potential biomarker for pathological angiogenesis.\n\nAuthor summaryAngiogenesis, the process by which new blood vessels are formed by sprouting from the pre-existing vascular bed, plays a key role in both physiological and pathological processes, including tumour growth. The structure of a growing vascular network is determined by the coordinated behaviour of endothelial cells in response to various signalling cues. Recent experimental studies have highlighted the importance of cell rearrangements as a driver for sprout elongation. However, the functional role of this phenomenon remains unclear. We formulate a new multiscale model of angiogenesis which, by accounting explicitly for the complex dynamics of endothelial cells within growing angiogenic sprouts, is able to produce generic features of angiogenic structures (branching, chemotactic sensitivity, cell mixing, etc.) as emergent properties of its dynamics. We validate our model against experimental data and then use it to quantify the phenomenon of cell mixing in vascular networks generated by endothelial cells of different lineages. Our results show that there is a direct correlation between the time evolution of cell mixing in a growing vascular network and its branching structure, thus paving the way for understanding the functional role of cell rearrangements in angiogenesis.",

We were able to recapitulate this distribution pattern in a theoretical model by implementing the stochastic disappearance of vessel segments around arteries could reproduce the observed exponential distribution of islands. Second, we observed that the diameter distribution of the retinal artery segment obeyed a power law;.

    "abstract": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic that continues to pose significant public health concerns. While research to deliver vaccines and antivirals are being pursued, various effective technologies to control its environmental spread are also being targeted. Ultraviolet light (UV-C) technologies are effective against a broad spectrum of microorganisms when used even on large surface areas. In this study, we developed a pyrimidine dinucleotide frequency based genomic model to predict the sensitivity of select enveloped and non-enveloped viruses to UV-C treatments in order to identify potential SARS-CoV-2 and human noroviruses surrogates. The results revealed that this model was best fitted using linear regression with r2=0.90. The predicted UV-C sensitivity (D90 - dose for 90% inactivation) for SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV was found to be 21 and 28 J/m2, respectively (with an estimated 18 J/m2 as published for SARS-CoV-1), suggesting that coronaviruses are highly sensitive to UV-C light compared to other ssRNA viruses used in this modeling study. Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) A59 strain with a D90 of 21 J/m2 close to that of SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a suitable surrogate to validate SARS-CoV-2 inactivation by UV-C treatment. Furthermore, the non-enveloped human noroviruses (HuNoVs), had predicted D90 values of 69.1, 89 and 77.6 J/m2 for genogroups GI, GII and GIV, respectively. Murine norovirus (MNV-1) of GV with a D90 = 100 J/m2 was identified as a potential conservative surrogate for UV-C inactivation of these HuNoVs. This study provides useful insights for the identification of potential nonpathogenic surrogates to understand inactivation kinetics and their use in experimental validation of UV-C disinfection systems. This approach can be used to narrow the number of surrogates used in testing UV-C inactivation of other human and animal ssRNA viral pathogens for experimental validation that can save cost, labor and time.",

    "abstract": "Transfer entropy (TE) is a widely used measure of directed information flows in a number of domains including neuroscience. Many real-world time series in which we are interested in information flows come in the form of (near) instantaneous events occurring over time, including the spiking of biological neurons, trades on stock markets and posts to social media. However, there exist severe limitations to the current approach to TE estimation on such event-based data via discretising the time series into time bins: it is not consistent, has high bias, converges slowly and cannot simultaneously capture relationships that occur with very fine time precision as well as those that occur over long time intervals. Building on recent work which derived a theoretical framework for TE in continuous time, we present an estimation framework for TE on event-based data and develop a k-nearest-neighbours estimator within this framework. This estimator is provably consistent, has favourable bias properties and converges orders of magnitude more quickly than the discrete-time estimator on synthetic examples. We also develop a local permutation scheme for generating null surrogate time series to test for the statistical significance of the TE and, as such, test for the conditional independence between the history of one point process and the updates of another -- signifying the lack of a causal connection under certain weak assumptions. Our approach is capable of detecting conditional independence or otherwise even in the presence of strong pairwise time-directed correlations. The power of this approach is further demonstrated on the inference of the connectivity of biophysical models of a spiking neural circuit inspired by the pyloric circuit of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion, succeeding where previous related estimators have failed.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYTransfer Entropy (TE) is an information-theoretic measure commonly used in neuroscience to measure the directed statistical dependence between a source and a target time series, possibly also conditioned on other processes. Along with measuring information flows, it is used for the inference of directed functional and effective networks from time series data. The currently-used technique for estimating TE on neural spike trains first time-discretises the data and then applies a straightforward or \"plug-in\" information-theoretic estimation procedure. This approach has numerous drawbacks: it is very biased, it cannot capture relationships occurring on both fine and large timescales simultaneously, converges very slowly as more data is obtained, and indeed does not even converge to the correct value. We present a new estimator for TE which operates in continuous time, demonstrating via application to synthetic examples that it addresses these problems, and can reliably differentiate statistically significant flows from (conditionally) independent spike trains. Further, we also apply it to more biologically-realistic spike trains obtained from a biophysical model of the pyloric circuit of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion; our correct inference of the underlying connection structure here provides an important validation for our approach where similar methods have previously failed",

    "abstract": "The spinal cord emerges from a niche of neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) formed and maintained by Wnt/FGF signals at the posterior end of the embryo. NMPs can be generated from human pluripotent stem cells and hold promise for spinal cord replacement therapies. However, NMPs are transient, which complicates the full range production of rostrocaudal spinal cord identities in vitro. Here we report the generation of NMP-derived pre-neural progenitors (PNPs) with stem cell-like self-renewal capacity. PNPs maintain pre-spinal cord identity by co-expressing the transcription factors SOX2 and CDX2, and lose mesodermal potential by downregulating TBXT. For 7 to 10 passages PNPs divide to self-renew and to make trunk neural crest (NC), while gradually adopting a more posterior identity by activating colinear HOX gene expression. This HOX clock can be halted at the thoracic level for up to 30 passages by blocking the trunk-to-tail transition through GDF11-mediated signal inhibition.",

    "abstract": "D-serine is the primary NMDA receptor (NMDAR) co-agonist at mature forebrain synapses and is synthesized by the enzyme serine racemase (SR). However, our understanding of the mechanisms regulating the availability of synaptic D-serine remains limited. Though early studies suggested D-serine is synthesized and released from astrocytes, more recent studies have demonstrated a predominantly neuronal localization of SR. More specifically, recent work intriguingly suggests that SR may be found at the postsynaptic density, yet the functional implications of postsynaptic SR on synaptic transmission are not yet known. Here, we show an age-dependent dendritic and postsynaptic localization of SR and D-serine by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy in mouse CA1 pyramidal neurons, as well as the presence of SR in human hippocampal synaptosomes. In addition, using a single-neuron genetic approach in SR conditional knockout mice, we demonstrate a cell-autonomous role for SR in regulating synaptic NMDAR function at Schaffer collateral (CA3)-CA1 synapses. Importantly, single-neuron genetic deletion of SR resulted in the elimination of LTP at one month of age. Interestingly, there was a restoration of LTP by two months of age that was associated with an upregulation of synaptic GluN2B. Our findings support a cell-autonomous role for postsynaptic neuronal SR in regulating synaptic NMDAR function and suggests a possible autocrine mode of D-serine action.",
