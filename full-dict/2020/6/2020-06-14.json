    "abstract": "Tumors subvert immune cell function to evade immune responses, yet the complex mechanisms driving immune evasion remain poorly understood. Here we show that tumors induce de novo steroidogenesis in T lymphocytes to evade anti-tumor immunity. Using a novel transgenic steroidogenesis-reporter mouse line we identify and characterize de novo steroidogenic immune cells. Genetic ablation of T cell steroidogenesis restricts primary tumor growth and metastatic dissemination in mouse models. Steroidogenic T cells dysregulate anti-tumor immunity, and inhibition of the steroidogenesis pathway was sufficient to restore anti-tumor immunity. This study demonstrates T cell de novo steroidogenesis as a mechanism of anti-tumor immunosuppression and a potential druggable target.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesEpigenetic mechanisms influence the development and maintenance of complex phenotypes and may also contribute to the evolution of species-specific phenotypes. With respect to skeletal traits, little is known about the gene regulation underlying these hard tissues or how tissue-specific patterns are associated with bone morphology or vary among species. To begin exploring these topics, this study evaluates one epigenetic mechanism, DNA methylation, in skeletal tissues from five nonhuman primate species which display anatomical and locomotor differences representative of their phylogenetic groups.\n\nMaterials and MethodsFirst, we test whether intra-specific variation in skeletal DNA methylation is associated with intra-specific variation in femur morphology. Second, we identify inter-specific differences in DNA methylation and assess whether these lineage-specific patterns may have contributed to species-specific morphologies. Specifically, we use the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip to identify DNA methylation patterns in femur trabecular bone from baboons (n=28), macaques (n=10), vervets (n=10), chimpanzees (n=4), and marmosets (n=6).\n\nResultsSignificant differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were associated with a subset of morphological variants, but these likely have small biological effects and may be confounded by other variables associated with morphological variation. Conversely, several species-specific DMPs were identified, and these are found in genes enriched for functions associated with complex skeletal traits.\n\nDiscussionOverall, these findings reveal that while intra-specific epigenetic variation is not readily associated with skeletal morphology differences, some inter-specific epigenetic differences in skeletal tissues exist and may contribute to evolutionarily distinct phenotypes. This work forms a foundation for future explorations of gene regulation and skeletal trait evolution in primates.",

    "abstract": "Many species are shifting their ranges being forced to rapidly respond to novel stressful environmental conditions. Colonizing individuals experience strong selective forces that favor the expression of life history traits notably affecting dispersal and reproductive rates in newly invaded habitats. Limited information is currently available on trait variation within the invasive range despite being critical for understanding ecological and evolutionary factors that drive the process of range expansion of invasive species. Here we evaluated life history shifts of the widely introduced Asian clam Corbicula, within its invaded range. Through an exhaustive literature search, we obtained data for 17 invasive Corbicula populations from different ecosystems worldwide. We tested the relationship between population and individual parameters relevant to the process of range expansion. Our main results are that recently introduced Corbicula populations were characterized by (i) low density and low rate of population increase, (ii) clams reproduced earlier in slow-growing populations, and (iii) density had no effect on population increase. All Corbicula populations analyzed in this study, which are fixed for one genotype (lineage Form A/R), experienced different selective environments in the introduced range. These findings support the perspective that adaptive phenotypic plasticity favored the expression of traits that maximize fitness in recently established populations, which faced stronger r-selective forces relative to long-established ones. We discuss the role of plasticity in facilitating rapid adaptation and increasing the likelihood of populations to overcome difficulties associated with low densities and low population increase in newly invaded areas.",

    "abstract": "Local structural frustration, the existence of mutually exclusive competing interactions, may explain why some proteins are dynamic while others are rigid. Frustration is thought to underpin biomolecular recognition and the flexibility of protein binding sites. Here we show how a small chemical modification, the oxidation of two cysteine thiols to a disulfide bond, during the catalytic cycle of the N-terminal domain of the key bacterial oxidoreductase DsbD (nDsbD), introduces frustration ultimately influencing protein function. In oxidized nDsbD, local frustration disrupts the packing of the protective cap-loop region against the active site allowing loop opening. By contrast, in reduced nDsbD the cap loop is rigid, always protecting the active-site thiols from the oxidizing environment of the periplasm. Our results point towards an intricate coupling between the dynamics of the active-site cysteines and of the cap loop which modulates the association reactions of nDsbD with its partners resulting in optimized protein function.",

Current experiments have focused on two possibilities: pacemaker neurons and stretch-receptor feedback. Here, we focus on whether it is possible that a chain of multiple network rhythmic pattern generators in the ventral nerve cord also contribute to locomotion. We use a simulation model to search for parameters of the anatomically constrained ventral nerve cord circuit that, when embodied and situated, can drive forward locomotion on agar, in the absence of pacemaker neurons or stretch-receptor feedback. Systematic exploration of the space of possible solutions reveals that there are multiple configurations that result in locomotion that is consistent with certain aspects of the kinematics of worm locomotion on agar. Analysis of the best solutions reveals that gap junctions between different classes of motorneurons in the ventral nerve cord can play key roles in coordinating the multiple rhythmic pattern generators.",

    "abstract": "We present evidence that phage resistance resulting from overproduction of exopolysaccharides, mucoidy, provides a general answer to the longstanding question of how lytic viruses are maintained in populations dominated by bacteria upon which they cannot replicate. In serial transfer culture, populations of mucoid E. coli MG1655 that are resistant to lytic phages with different receptors, and thereby requiring independent mutations for surface resistance, are capable of maintaining these phages with little effect on their total density. Based on the results of our analysis of a mathematical model, we postulate that the maintenance of phage in populations dominated by mucoid cells can be attributed primarily to high rates of transition from the resistant mucoid states to susceptible non-mucoid states. Our tests with both population dynamic and single cell experiments as well as DNA sequence analysis are consistent with this hypothesis. We discuss reasons for the generalized resistance of these mucoid E. coli, and the genetic and molecular mechanisms responsible for the high rate of transition from mucoid to sensitive states responsible for the maintenance of lytic phage in mucoid populations of E. coli.",

Non-human primate findings have shown that decision-making implicates modulations in unit firing rates and local field potentials (LFPs) across frontal and parietal cortices. Yet the electrophysiological brain mechanisms that underlie free choice in humans remain ill defined. Here, we address this question using rare intracerebral EEG recordings in surgical epilepsy patients performing a delayed oculomotor decision task. We find that the temporal dynamics of high gamma (HG, 60-140 Hz) neural activity in distinct frontal and parietal brain areas robustly discriminate free choice from instructed saccade planning at the level of single trials. Classification analysis was applied to the LFP signals to isolate decision-related activity from sensory and motor planning processes. Compared to instructed saccades, free choice trials exhibited delayed and longer-lasting HG activity. The temporal dynamics of these sustained decision-related responses distinguished deliberation-related from working memory processes. Taken together, these findings provide the first direct electrophysiological evidence in humans for the role of sustained high-frequency neural activation in fronto-parietal cortex in mediating the intrinsically driven process of freely choosing among competing behavioral alternatives.\n\nHighlightsO_LIFirst intracerebral recordings in humans performing an oculomotor decision-making task\nC_LIO_LIMachine learning analytics unravel underlying spectral and temporal brain dynamics\nC_LIO_LIFree choice trials exhibit sustained fronto-parietal high gamma (HG) activity during the delay\nC_LIO_LIMaking a decision and maintaining it in working memory are associated with distinct sustained HG dynamics\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Transgenerational plasticity (TGP) occurs when the environment experienced by parents induces changes in traits of offspring and/or subsequent generations. Such effects can be adaptive or non-adaptive and are increasingly recognised as key determinants of health, cognition, development and performance across a wide range of taxa, including humans. While the conditions that favour maternal TGP are well understood, rapidly accumulating evidence indicates that TGP can be maternal or paternal, and offspring responses can be sex-specific. However, the evolutionary mechanisms that drive this diversity are unknown. We used an individual-based model to investigate the evolution of TGP when the sexes experience different ecologies. We find that adaptive TGP rarely evolves when alleles at loci that determine offspring responses to environmental information originating from the mother and father are subject to sexually antagonistic selection. By contrast, duplication and sex-limitation of such loci can allow for the evolution of a variety of sex-specific responses, including non-adaptive sex-specific TGP when sexual selection is strong. Sexual conflict could therefore help to explain why adaptive TGP evolves in some species but not others, why sons and daughters respond to parental signals in different ways, and why complex patterns of sex-specific TGP may often be non-adaptive.",

Retrieval is done using high resolution mass spectrometry as a chemical reaction detector, where PMDs calculated from the mass spectrometry data are linked to biochemical reactions obtained via data mining of small molecule and reaction databases, i.e.  Reactomics. We demonstrate applications of reactomics including PMD network analysis, source appointment of unknown compounds, and biomarker reaction discovery as a complement to compound discovery analyses used in traditional untargeted workflows.

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are central components of the innate immune system providing protection against pathogens. Yet, serum and tissue concentrations vary between individuals and disease conditions. We demonstrate that the human AMP LL-37 lowers the susceptibility to vancomycin in the community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) strain FPR3757 (USA300). Vancomycin is used to treat serious MRSA infections, but treatment failures occur despite MRSA strains being tested susceptible according to standard susceptibility methods. Exposure to physiologically relevant concentrations of LL-37 increased the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of S. aureus towards vancomycin by 75% and resulted in shortened lag-phase and increased colony formation at sub-inhibitory concentrations of vancomycin. Computer simulations using a mathematical antibiotic treatment model indicated that a small increase in MIC might decrease the efficacy of vancomycin in clearing an S. aureus infection. This prediction was supported in a Galleria mellonella infection model, where exposure of S. aureus to LL-37 abolished the antimicrobial effect of vancomycin. Thus, physiologically relevant concentrations of LL-37 reduce susceptibility to vancomycin, indicating that tissue and host-specific variations in LL-37 concentrations may influence vancomycin susceptibility in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Many aspects of human behavior are inherently rhythmic, requiring production of rhythmic motor actions as well as synchronizing to rhythms in the environment. It is well-established that individuals with ADHD exhibit deficits in temporal estimation and timing functions, which may impact their ability to accurately produce and interact with rhythmic stimuli. In the current study we seek to understand the specific aspects of rhythmic behavior that are implicated in ADHD. We specifically ask whether they are attributed to imprecision in the internal generation of rhythms or to reduced acuity in rhythm perception. We also test key predictions of the Preferred Period Hypothesis, which suggests that both perceptual and motor rhythmic behaviors are biased towards a specific personal  default tempo. To this end, we tested several aspects of rhythmic behavior and the correspondence between them, including spontaneous motor tempo (SMT), preferred auditory perceptual tempo (PPT) and synchronization-continuations tapping in a broad range of rhythms, from sub-second to supra-second intervals. Moreover, we evaluate the intra-subject consistency of rhythmic preferences, as a means for testing the reality and reliability of personal  default-rhythms. We used a modified operational definition for assessing SMT and PPT, instructing participants to tap or calibrate the rhythms most comfortable for them to count along with, to avoid subjective interpretations of the task.\n\nOur results shed new light on the specific aspect of rhythmic deficits implicated in ADHD adults. We find that individuals with ADHD are primarily challenged in producing and maintaining isochronous self-generated motor rhythms, during both spontaneous and memory-paced tapping. However, they nonetheless exhibit good flexibility for synchronizing to a broad range of external rhythms, suggesting that auditory-motor entrainment for simple rhythms is preserved in ADHD, and that the presence of an external pacer allows overcoming their inherent difficulty in self-generating isochronous motor rhythms. In addition, both groups showed optimal memory-paced tapping for rhythms near their  counting-based SMT and PPT, which were slightly faster in the ADHD group. This is in line with the predictions of the Preferred Period Hypothesis, indicating that at least for this well-defined rhythmic behavior (i.e., counting), individuals tend to prefer similar time-scales in both motor production and perceptual evaluation.",

    "abstract": "A gene regulatory network can be described at a high level by a directed graph with signed edges, and at a more detailed level by a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The former qualitatively models the causal regulatory interactions between ordered pairs of genes, while the latter quantitatively models the time-varying concentrations of mRNA and proteins. This paper clarifies the connection between the two types of models.\n\nWe propose a property, called the constant sign property, for a general class of ODE models. The constant sign property characterizes the set of conditions (system parameters, external signals, or internal states) under which an ODE model is consistent with a signed, directed graph. If the constant sign property for an ODE model holds globally for all conditions, then the ODE model has a single signed, directed graph. If the constant sign property for an ODE model only holds locally, which may be more typical, then the ODE model corresponds to different graphs under different sets of conditions. In addition, two versions of constant sign property are given and a relationship between them is proved.\n\nAs an example, the ODE models that capture the effect of cis-regulatory elements involving protein complex binding, based on the model in the GeneNetWeaver source code, are described in detail and shown to satisfy the global constant sign property with a unique consistent gene regulatory graph. Even a single gene regulatory graph is shown to have many ODE models of GeneNetWeaver type consistent with it due to combinatorial complexity and continuous parameters.\n\nFinally the question of how closely data generated by one ODE model can be fit by another ODE model is explored. It is observed that the fit is better if the two models come from the same graph.",

    "abstract": "Revealing the mechanisms underlying the breath-taking morphological diversity observed in nature is a major challenge in Biology. It has been established that recurrent mutations in hotspot genes cause the repeated evolution of rather simple morphological traits, such as body pigmentation or the gain and loss of structures. To date, however, it remains elusive whether hotspot genes contribute to natural variation in complex morphological traits, such as the size and shape of organs. Since natural variation in head morphology is pervasive in Drosophila, we studied the molecular and developmental basis of differences in compound eye size and head shape in two closely related Drosophila species. We show that differences in both traits are established late during head development and we applied comparative transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility data to identify the GATA transcription factor Pannier (Pnr) as central factor regulating these differences. Although the genetic manipulation of Pnr affected multiple aspects of dorsal head development, the effect of natural variation is restricted to a subset of the phenotypic space. We present data suggesting that this developmental constraint is caused by the co-evolution of expression of pnr and its co-factor u-shaped (ush). We propose that natural variation in highly connected developmental regulators with pleiotropic functions is a major driver for morphological evolution and we discuss implications on gene regulatory network evolution. In comparison to previous findings, our data strongly suggests that evolutionary hotspots do not contribute to the repeated evolution of eye size and head shape in Drosophila.",

We expected different ear advantages (left or right) depending on task demands, information type, and worry level. We used a full Bayesian approach for statistical modelling and analysis. Results indicate that when participants made delayed responses (Experiment 1), reaction times barely increased as a function of worry level, but under time pressure (Experiment 2) worry level induced clear decreases in reaction times. We explain these results in terms of multistep models of anxiety and language, concluding that present results mainly indicate effects threat aversion-related over-attention to threat, and that we do not provide enough evidence for supporting the integration of anxiety and language multiphasic models.",

    "abstract": "The formation of membrane protrusions during migration is reliant upon the cells cytoskeletal structure and stiffness. It has been reported that actin disruption blocks protrusions and decreases cell stiffness whereas microtubule disruption blocks protrusion but increases stiffness in several cell types. In melanoma, cell migration is of concern as this cancer spreads unusually rapidly during early tumour development. The aim of this study was to characterise motility, structural properties and stiffness of human melanoma cells at radial growth phase (RGP), vertical growth phase (VGP), and metastatic stage (MET) in two-dimensional in vitro environments. Wound assays, western blotting and mitochondrial particle tracking were used to assess cell migration, cytoskeletal content and intracellular fluidity. Our results indicate that cell motility increase with increasing disease stage. Despite their different motility, RGP and VGP cells exhibit similar fluidity, actin and tubulin levels. MET cells, however, display increased fluidity which was associated with increased actin and tubulin content. Our findings demonstrate an interplay between actin and microtubule activity and their role in increasing motility of cells while minimizing cell stiffness at advanced disease stage. In earlier disease stages, cell stiffness may however not serve as an indicator of migratory capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) makes  first contact with a host in the alveolar space, an interaction largely inaccessible to experimental observation. We establish a lung-on-chip model for early tuberculosis and use time-lapse imaging to reveal the dynamics of host-Mtb interactions at an air-liquid interface with a spatiotemporal resolution unattainable in animal models. By reconstituting host physiology in a modular manner, we probe the role of pulmonary surfactant secreted by alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) in early infection. This is difficult to study directly in animal models, as surfactant-deficient animals are either non-viable or develop acute lung pathologies. We demonstrate that surfactant deficiency results in rapid and uncontrolled Mtb growth in both macrophages and AECs. In contrast, under normal surfactant levels, a significant fraction of intracellular bacteria are non-growing. The surfactant-deficient phenotype is rescued by exogenous addition of surfactant replacement formulations, which have no effect on bacterial viability in the absence of host cells. Surfactant partially removes virulence-associated lipids and proteins 1,2 from the bacterial cell surface and consistent with this mechanism of action, we show that attenuation of bacteria lacking the virulence-associated ESX-1 secretion system is independent of surfactant levels. These findings may partly explain why individuals with compromised surfactant function, such as smokers and elderly persons, are at increased risk of developing active tuberculosis.",

The model generates a range of disease dynamics consistent with observed Aedes aegypti abundances and laboratory-confirmed arboviral incidence with variable accuracy (28 - 85% for vectors, 44 - 88% for incidence). The model predicted vector dynamics better in sites with a smaller proportion of young children in the population, lower mean temperature, and homes with piped water and made of cement.

    "abstract": "Population divergence and gene flow are key processes in evolution and ecology. Model-based analysis of genome-wide datasets allows discrimination between alternative scenarios for these processes even in non-model taxa. We used two complementary approaches (one based on the blockwise site frequency spectrum (bSFS), the second on the Pairwise Sequentially Markovian Coalescent (PSMC)) to infer the divergence history of a fig wasp, Pleistodontes nigriventris. Pleistodontes nigriventris and its fig tree mutualist Ficus watkinsiana are restricted to rain forest patches along the eastern coast of Australia, and are separated into northern and southern populations by two dry forest corridors (the Burdekin and St. Lawrence Gaps). We generated whole genome sequence data for two haploid males per population and used the bSFS approach to infer the timing of divergence between northern and southern populations of P. nigriventris, and to discriminate between alternative isolation with migration (IM) and instantaneous admixture (ADM) models of post divergence gene flow. Pleistodontes nigriventris has low genetic diversity ({pi} = 0.0008), to our knowledge one of the lowest estimates reported for a sexually reproducing arthropod. We find strongest support for an ADM model in which the two populations diverged ca. 196kya in the late Pleistocene, with almost 25% of northern lineages introduced from the south during an admixture event ca. 57kya. This divergence history is highly concordant with individual population demographies inferred from each pair of haploid males using PSMC. Our analysis illustrates the inferences possible with genome-level data for small population samples of tiny, non-model organisms and adds to a growing body of knowledge on the population structure of Australian rain forest taxa.",

    "abstract": "Host immune responses to Staphylococcus epidermidis, a frequent cause of nosocomial infections, are not well understood. We have established a novel bath immersion model of this infection in zebrafish larvae. S.epidermidis infection activates Tlr-2 signalling pathway by upregulation of tlr-2. Macrophages play a primary role in the host immune response and are involved in clearance of infection in the larvae. There is marked inflammation characterised by heightened NF-{kappa}B signalling and elevation of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. Infected larvae show rapid upregulation of il-1b and tnf-a transcripts and relatively slower elevation of il-6 transcription. The IL-6 signalling pathway is additionally subject to amplification by elevation of IL-6 signal transducer (il-6st) levels, which negatively correlates with miRNA dre-miR-142-5p expression. Enhanced IL-6 signalling is protective to the host in this model as inhibition of the signalling pathway resulted in increased mortality upon S.epidermidis infection. Our study describes the host immune responses to S.epidermidis infection, identifies a likely role for miR-142-5p - il-6st interaction in modulating this response and establishes the importance of IL-6 signalling in this infection model.",

    "abstract": "Understanding spoken words requires the rapid matching of a complex acoustic stimulus with stored lexical representations. The degree to which the brain networks supporting spoken word recognition are affected by adult aging remains poorly understood. In the current study we used fMRI to measure the brain responses to spoken words in two conditions: an attentive listening condition, in which no response was required, and a repetition task. Listeners were 29 young adults (aged 19-30 years) and 32 older adults (aged 65-81 years) without self-reported hearing difficulty. We found largely similar patterns of activity during word perception for both young and older adults, centered on bilateral superior temporal gyrus. As expected, the repetition condition resulted in significantly more activity in areas related to motor planning and execution (including premotor cortex and supplemental motor area) compared to the attentive listening condition. Importantly, however, older adults showed significantly less activity in probabilistically-defined auditory cortex than young adults when listening to individual words in both the attentive listening and repetition tasks. Age differences in auditory cortex activity were seen selectively for words (no age differences were present for 1-channel vocoded speech, used as a control condition), and could not be easily explained by accuracy on the task, movement in the scanner, or hearing sensitivity (available on a subset of participants). These findings indicate largely similar patterns of brain activity for young and older adults when listening to words in quiet, but suggest less recruitment of auditory cortex by the older adults.",

    "abstract": "All neocortical sensory areas have an associated primary and secondary thalamic nucleus. While the primary nuclei encode sensory information for transmission to cortex, the nature of information encoded in secondary nuclei is poorly understood. We recorded juxtasomally from neurons in secondary somatosensory (POm) and visual (LP) thalamic nuclei of awake head-fixed mice with simultaneous whisker tracking and pupilometry. POm activity correlated with whether or not a mouse was whisking, but not precise whisking kinematics. This coarse movement modulation persisted after unilateral paralysis of the whisker pad and thus was not due to sensory reafference. POm continued to track whisking even during optogenetic silencing of primary somatosensory and motor cortex and after lesion of superior colliculus, indicating that motor efference copy cannot explain the correlation between movement and POm activity. Whisking and pupil dilation were strongly correlated, raising the possibility that POm may track arousal rather than movement. LP, being part of the visual system, is not expected to encode whisker movement. We discovered, however, that LP and POm track whisking equally well, suggesting a global effect of arousal on both nuclei. We conclude that secondary thalamus is a monitor of behavioral state, rather than movement, and may exist to alter cortical activity accordingly.",

The canonical model of the LINC complex is of individual linear nucleocytoskeletal linkages provided by 3:3 interactions between SUN and KASH proteins. Here, we provide crystallographic and biophysical evidence that SUN-KASH is a constitutive 6:6 complex in which two SUN trimers interact back-to-back. A common SUN-KASH topology is achieved through structurally diverse 6:6 interaction mechanisms by distinct KASH proteins, including zinc-coordination by Nesprin-4. The SUN-KASH 6:6 complex is incompatible with the current model of a linear LINC complex and instead suggests the formation of a branched LINC complex network. In this model, SUN-KASH 6:6 complexes act as nodes for force distribution and integration between adjacent SUN and KASH molecules, enabling the coordinated transduction of large forces across the nuclear envelope.",

    "abstract": "Many clinical and preclinical studies report higher prevalence and severity of chronic pain in females. We used hyperalgesic priming with interleukin 6 (IL-6) priming and PGE2 as a second stimulus as a model for pain chronicity. Intraplantar IL-6 induced hypersensitivity was similar in magnitude and duration in both males and females, while both paw and intrathecal PGE2 hypersensitivity was more persistent in females. This difference in PGE2 response was dependent on both circulating estrogen and translation regulation signaling in the spinal cord. In males, the duration of hypersensitivity was regulated by testosterone. Since the prolactin receptor (Prlr) is regulated by reproductive hormones and is female-selectively activated in sensory neurons, we evaluated whether Prlr signaling contributes to hyperalgesic priming. Using {Delta}PRL, a competitive Prlr antagonist, and a mouse line with ablated Prlr in the Nav1.8 sensory neuronal population, we show that Prlr in sensory neurons is necessary for the development of hyperalgesic priming in female but not male mice. Overall, sex-specific mechanisms in the initiation and maintenance of chronic pain are regulated by the neuroendocrine system and, specifically, sensory neuronal Prlr signaling.\n\nSignificance StatementFemales are more likely to experience chronic pain than males, but the mechanisms that underlie this sex difference are not completely understood. Here, we demonstrate that the duration of mechanical hypersensitivity is dependent on circulating sex hormones in mice - where estrogen caused an extension of sensitivity and testosterone was responsible for a decrease in the duration of the hyperalgesic priming model of chronic pain. Additionally, we demonstrated that Prolactin receptor expression in Nav1.8+ neurons was necessary for hyperalgesic priming in female, but not male mice. Our work demonstrates a female-specific mechanism for the promotion of chronic pain involving the neuroendrocrine system and mediated by sensory neuronal prolactin receptor.",

Perler accurately predicted the spatial gene expression of Drosophila embryos, zebrafish embryos, mammalian liver, and mouse visual cortex from scRNA-seq data. Furthermore, the reconstructed transcriptomes did not over-fit the ISH data and preserved the timing information of the scRNA-seq data.

Many studies have been dedicated towards finding an algorithm to solve Sudoku but investigation of the neural substrates involved in Sudoku has been challenging. It is difficult to measure the brain activity during 9x9 Sudoku using traditional fMRI technique due to the procedural constraints. 16 optodes fNIRS (functional near infrared spectroscopy) forms an excellent alternative to study the activity of prefrontal cortex (PFC) during Sudoku task. Sudoku task was divided into two steps to understand the differential function of the PFC while applying heuristic rules. Classical two-way ANOVA as well as General Linear Model based approach was used to analyze the data. 28-noise free recording from right-handed participants revealed increased activity in all 16 optode locations during step 1 (3 x 3 subgrids) and step 2 (easy level 9x9 Sudoku) as compared to rest. Contrasting the step2-step1 revealed that medial regions of PFC were preferentially activated.

    "abstract": "Streptococcus suis is part of the pig commensal microbiome and a major pathogen causing pneumonia and meningitis in pigs and occasionally also zoonotic meningitis. According to genomic analysis, S. suis is divided into asymptomatic carriage, respiratory and systemic strains with distinct genomic signatures. The virulence factor S. suis adhesin P (SadP) recognizes the galabiose Gal1-4Gal-oligosaccharide. Based on its oligosaccharide fine specificity, SadP can be divided into subtypes PN and PO. We show here that subtype PN is distributed in the systemic strains that cause meningitis, whereas type PO is found in asymptomatic carriage and respiratory strains. Both types of SadP are shown to predominantly bind to pig lung globotriaosylceramide (Gb3). However, SadP adhesin from systemic subtype PN strain also binds to globotetraosylceramide (Gb4). Mutagenesis studies of the galabiose-binding domain of type PN SadP adhesin showed that the amino acid asparagine-285, which is replaced by an aspartate residue in type Po SadP, was required for binding to Gb4 and, strikingly, it was also required for interaction with the glycomimetic inhibitor phenylurea-galabiose. Molecular dynamics simulations provided further insight into the role of Asn-285 for Gb4 and phenylurea-galabiose binding, suggesting additional hydrogen bonding to terminal GalNAc of Gb4 and urea-group. Thus, the Asn-285-mediated molecular mechanism of type PN SadP binding to Gb4 could be used as a candidate to selectively target S. suis in invasive systemic disease without interfering with commensal strains, which may open up new venues for developing intervention strategies against this pathogen.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe vast ecosystem of single-cell RNA-seq tools has until recently been plagued by an excess of diverging analysis strategies, inconsistent file formats, and compatibility issues between different software suites. The uptake of 10x Genomics datasets has begun to calm this diversity, and the bioinformatics community leans once more towards the large computing requirements and the statistically-driven methods needed to process and understand these ever-growing datasets.\n\nResultsHere we outline several Galaxy workflows and learning resources for scRNA-seq, with the aim of providing a comprehensive analysis environment paired with a thorough user learning experience that bridges the knowledge gap between the computational methods and the underlying cell biology. The Galaxy reproducible bioinformatics framework provides tools, workflows and trainings that not only enable users to perform one-click 10x preprocessing, but also empowers them to demultiplex raw sequencing from custom tagged and full-length sequencing protocols. The downstream analysis supports a wide range of high-quality interoperable suites separated into common stages of analysis: inspection, filtering, normalization, confounder removal and clustering. The teaching resources cover an assortment of different concepts from computer science to cell biology. Access to all resources is provided at the singlecell.usegalaxy.eu portal.\n\nConclusionsThe reproducible and training-oriented Galaxy framework provides a sustainable HPC environment for users to run flexible analyses on both 10x and alternative platforms. The tutorials from the Galaxy Training Network along with the frequent training workshops hosted by the Galaxy Community provide a means for users to learn, publish and teach scRNA-seq analysis.\n\nKey PointsO_LISingle-cell RNA-seq has stabilised towards 10x Genomics datasets.\nC_LIO_LIGalaxy provides rich and reproducible scRNA-seq workflows with a wide range of robust tools.\nC_LIO_LIThe Galaxy Training Network provides tutorials for the processing of both 10x and non-10x datasets.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The evolution and maintenance of sexual systems in plants is often driven by resource allocation and pollinator preferences, and very little is known about their role in determining floral sex expression in plants. In annual, entomophilous plants three major constraints can be identified towards optimal reproduction: 1) nutrient resources available from the environment, 2) nutrient resources allocated towards reproduction, i.e., fruits vs. flowers, and 3) pollinator visitations.Andromonoecy is a sexual system where plants bear both staminate and hermaphrodite flowers on the same inflorescence. The optimal resource allocation hypothesis suggests that under nutrient constraints, plants will produce more male flowers since they are energetically cheaper to produce over the more expensive hermaphrodite flowers. We test this hypothesis in the andromonoecious Murdannia simplex (Commelinaceae) by quantifying male and hermaphrodite flowers in a natural population and contrasting the distribution of the two sexes in plants from two resource conditions (stream population vs. plateau population). We next carried out choice experiments to test pollinator preference towards a specific sex.We found that in M. simplex, production of hermaphrodite flowers is resource-dependent and under resource constraints fewer numbers of flowers were produced and most of them were males. We failed to observe pollinator preference towards either sex but Amegilla spp. and Apis cerana showed higher visitation towards the most abundant sex within a trial, suggesting frequency-dependent visitation. Thus, we conclude that environmentally driven resource constraints play a bigger role in driving floral sex expression in Murdannia over direct pollinator-driven constraints.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Understanding the processes by which the mammalian embryo implants in the maternal uterus is a long-standing challenge in embryology. New insights into this morphogenetic event could be of great importance in helping, for example, to reduce human infertility. During implantation the blastocyst, composed of epiblast and trophectoderm, undergoes significant remodelling from an oval ball to an egg cylinder. A main feature of this transformation is symmetry breaking and reshaping of the epiblast into a \u201ccup\u201d. Based on previous studies, we hypothesise that this event is the result of mechanical constraints originating from the trophectoderm, which is also significantly transformed during this process. In order to investigate this hypothesis we propose MG#, an original computational model of biomechanics able to reproduce key cell shape changes and tissue level behaviours in silico. With this model, we simulate epiblast and trophectoderm morphogenesis during implantation. First, our results uphold experimental findings that repulsion at the apical surface of the epiblast is sufficient to drive lumenogenesis. Then, we provide new theoretical evidence that trophectoderm morphogenesis indeed dictates the cup shape of the epiblast and fosters its movement towards the uterine tissue. Together, these results offer mechanical insights into mouse implantation and highlight the usefulness of agent-based modelling methods in the study of embryogenesis.Author summary Computational modelling is increasingly used in the context of biological development. Here we propose a novel agent-based model of biological cell and tissue mechanics to investigate important morphological changes during mouse embryo implantation. Our model is able to replicate key biological cell shape changes and tissue-level behaviour. Simulating mouse implantation with this model, we bring theoretical support to previous experimental observations that lumenogenesis in the epiblast is driven by repulsion, and provide theoretical evidence that changes in epiblast shape during implantation are regulated by trophectoderm development.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus agalactiae, also known as group B Streptococcus (GBS), is the major cause of neonatal sepsis in humans. A critical step to infection is adhesion of bacteria at mucosal surfaces. Though several GBS adhesins have been identified, the host receptor targets of these adhesins remain unknown. We report here that surface-expressed {beta} protein from GBS binds to human CEACAM1 and CEACAM5 receptors. A crystal structure of the complex showed that the IgSF domain in {beta} represents a novel Ig-fold subtype called IgI3, in which unique features allow binding to CEACAM1. Bioinformatic assessments revealed that this newly identified IgI3 fold is not exclusively present in GBS. Instead, the IgI3 fold is predicted to be present in adhesins from other clinically important human pathogens. We confirmed the interaction between CEACAM1 and the predicted IgI3-containing adhesin in two different streptococcal pathogens. Overall, our results indicate that the IgI3 fold could provide a broadly applied mechanism for bacteria to target CEACAMs.",

If deprived of competent progenitors, the thymus can maintain thymopoiesis autonomously for several weeks but this bears a high risk of leukemia. Here we show that double negative 3 early (DN3e) thymocytes can acquire stem cell like properties, which enables them to maintain thymopoiesis. Specifically, DN3e proved to be long-lived, they proliferated and differentiated in vivo, were necessary for autonomous thymopoiesis, and included DNA-label-retaining cells. Single cell RNAseq revealed a transcriptional program of thymopoiesis similar in autonomy and the controls. Nevertheless, a new population was identified in thymus autonomy that was enriched for an aberrant Notch target gene signature and bypassed the {beta}-selection checkpoint. In sum, DN3e have the potential to self-renew and differentiate in vivo if cell competition is compromised but this enables the accumulation of atypical cells, probably leading to leukemia.",

    "abstract": "The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected African American populations disproportionately in regards to both morbidity and mortality. A multitude of factors likely account for this discrepancy. Gene expression represents the interaction of genetics and environment. To elucidate whether levels of expression of genes implicated in COVID-19 vary in African Americans as compared to European Americans, we re-mine The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) RNA-Seq data. Multiple genes integral to infection, inflammation and immunity are differentially regulated across the two populations. Most notably, F8A2 and F8A3, which encode the HAP40 protein that mediates early endosome movement in Huntingtons Disease, are more highly expressed by up to 24-fold in African Americans. Such differences in gene expression can establish prognostic signatures and have critical implications for precision treatment of diseases such as COVID-19. We advocate routine inclusion of information such as postal code, education level, and profession (as a proxies for socioeconomic condition) and race in the metadata about each individual sampled for sequencing studies. This relatively simple change would enable large-scale data-driven approaches to dissect relationships among race, socio-economic factors, and disease.",

In this setting p53 is frequently wildtype and its activity may be suppressed via upregulation of its key regulator MDM2. This underlies our rationale to evaluate MDM2 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy in treatment resistant ER-positive breast cancer.\n\nMethodsWe used the MDM2 inhibitor NVP-CGM097 to treat in vitro and in vivo models alone and in combination with fulvestrant or palbociclib. We perform cell viability, cell cycle, apoptosis and senescence assays to evaluate antitumor effects in p53 wildtype and p53 mutant ER positive cell lines (MCF-7, ZR75-1, T-47D) and MCF-7 lines resistant to endocrine therapy and to CDK4/6 inhibition. We further assess the drug effects in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of endocrine-sensitive and -resistant ER positive breast cancer.\n\nResultsWe demonstrate that MDM2 inhibition results in cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis in p53-wildtype in vitro and in vivo breast cancer models, leading to potent anti-tumour activity. We find that endocrine therapy or CDK4/6 inhibition synergises with MDM2 inhibition but does not further enhance apoptosis. Instead, combination treatments result in profound regulation of cell cycle-related transcriptional programmes, with synergy achieved through increased antagonism of cell cycle progression. Combination therapy pushes cell lines resistant to fulvestrant or palbociclib to become senescent and significantly reduces tumour growth in a fulvestrant resistant patient derived xenograft model.\n\nConclusionsWe conclude that MDM2 inhibitors in combination with ER degraders or CDK4/6 inhibitors represent a rational strategy for treating advanced, endocrine resistant ER-positive breast cancer, operating through synergistic activation of cell cycle co-regulatory programs.",

Using Micro-C XL to detect chromosomal interactions, we observed the pervasive presence of cohesin-dependent loops with defined positions throughout the genome of budding yeast, as seen in mammalian cells. In early S phase, cohesin stably binds to cohesin associated regions (CARs) genome-wide. Subsequently, positioned loops accumulate with CARs at the bases of the loops. Cohesin regulators Wpl1 and Pds5 alter the levels and distribution of cohesin at CARs, changing the pattern of positioned loops. From these observations, we propose that cohesin with loop extrusion activity is stopped by preexisting CAR-bound cohesins, generating positioned loops. The patterns of loops observed in a population of wild-type and mutant cells can be explained by this mechanism, coupled with a heterogeneous residency of cohesin at CARs in individual cells.",

The ability to integrate a set of multi-technology measurements would allow the identification of biologically or clinically meaningful observations through the unification of the perspectives afforded by each technology. In most cases, however, profiling technologies consume the used cells and thus pairwise correspondences between datasets are lost. Due to the sheer size single-cell datasets can acquire, scalable algorithms that are able to universally match single-cell measurements carried out in one cell to its corresponding sibling in another technology are needed.\n\nResultsWe propose Single-Cell data Integration via Matching (SCIM), a scalable approach to recover such correspondences in two or more technologies. SCIM assumes that cells share a common (low-dimensional) underlying structure and that the underlying cell distribution is approximately constant across technologies. It constructs a technology-invariant latent space using an auto-encoder framework with an adversarial objective. Multi-modal datasets are integrated by pairing cells across technologies using a bipartite matching scheme that operates on the low-dimensional latent representations. We evaluate SCIM on a simulated cellular branching process and show that the cell-to-cell matches derived by SCIM reflect the same pseudotime on the simulated dataset. Moreover, we apply our method to two real-world scenarios, a melanoma tumor sample and a human bone marrow sample, where we pair cells from a scRNA dataset to their sibling cells in a CyTOF dataset achieving 93% and 84% cell-matching accuracy for each one of the samples respectively.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/ratschlab/scim",

The scheduled interview was carried out from 103 banana growers, two focused group discussion was carried out with the banana growers, and two key informant interview was carried out; one with the President of Banana Growers Association, Chitwan and another with Executive Director of Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Chitwan. The findings revealed that GAP related to soil management and fertilization (87.4%) and harvesting and on-farm processing (94.2%) is adopted at a low level. Only 36% of farmers apply an appropriate dose of chemical fertilizer, 28% follow crop rotation and 7.8% perform mulching/ intercropping. About 38% of the respondents do not have any source of irrigation. About 98% of the farmers do not perform any processing, cleaning, storing, and packaging of banana. Further, 55% of farmers do not use appropriate personal protective equipment while applying pesticides. The results showed that there is low awareness regarding GAP among the banana farmers in the Chitwan district. Therefore, the conduction of awareness programs and training related to GAP is recommended. By far, no study has been carried out to analyze the good agricultural practices applied by banana growers in Nepal.

    "abstract": "Many intracellular signaling pathways are composed of molecular switches, proteins that transition between two states--on and off. Typically, signaling is initiated when an external stimulus activates its cognate receptor that in turn causes downstream switches to transition from off to on using one of the following mechanisms: activation, in which the transition rate from the off state to the on state increases; derepression, in which the transition rate from the on state to the off state decreases; and concerted, in which activation and derepression operate simultaneously. We use mathematical modeling to compare these signaling mechanisms in terms of their dose-response curves, response times, and abilities to process upstream fluctuations. Our analysis elucidates several general principles. First, activation increases the sensitivity of the pathway, whereas derepression decreases sensitivity. Second, activation generates response times that decrease with signal strength, whereas derepression causes response times to increase with signal strength. These opposing features allow the concerted mechanism to not only show dose-response alignment, but also to decouple the response time from stimulus strength. However, these potentially beneficial properties come at the expense of increased susceptibility to up-stream fluctuations. In addition to above response metrics, we also examine the effect of receptor removal on switches governed by activation and derepression. We find that if inactive (active) receptors are preferentially removed then activation (derepression) exhibits a sustained response whereas derepression (activation) adapts. In total, we show how the architecture of molecular switches govern their response properties. We also discuss the biological implications of our findings.",

To better understand EBOV infection in vivo, we used single-cell transcriptomics and CyTOF-based single-cell protein quantification to characterize peripheral immune cell activity during EBOV infection in rhesus monkeys. We obtained 100,000 transcriptomes and 15,000,000 protein profiles, providing insight into pathogenesis. We find that immature, proliferative monocyte-lineage cells with reduced antigen presentation capacity replace conventional circulating monocyte subsets within days of infection, while lymphocytes upregulate apoptosis genes and decline in abundance. By quantifying viral RNA abundance in individual cells, we identify molecular determinants of tropism and examine temporal dynamics in viral and host gene expression. Within infected cells, we observe that EBOV down-regulates STAT1 mRNA and interferon signaling, and up-regulates putative pro-viral genes (e.g., DYNLL1 and HSPA5), nominating cellular pathways the virus manipulates for its replication. Overall, this study sheds light on EBOV tropism, replication dynamics, and elicited immune response, and provides a framework for characterizing interactions between hosts and emerging viruses in a maximum containment setting.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR systems provide bacteria and archaea with adaptive immunity against viruses and plasmids by detection and cleavage of invading foreign DNA. Modified versions of this system can be exploited as a biotechnological tool for precise genome editing at a targeted locus. Here, we developed a novel, replicative plasmid that carries the CRISPR-Cas9 system for RNA-programmable, genome editing by counterselection in the opportunistic human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. Specifically, we demonstrate an approach for making targeted, marker-less gene knockouts and large genome deletions. After a precise double-stranded break (DSB) is introduced, the cells DNA repair mechanism of homology-directed repair (HDR) pathway is being exploited to select successful transformants. This is achieved through the transformation of a template DNA fragment that will recombine in the genome and eliminate recognition of the target of the Cas9 endonuclease. Next, the newly engineered strain, can be easily cured from the plasmid that is temperature-sensitive for replication, by growing it at the non-permissive temperature. This allows for consecutive rounds of genome editing. Using this system, we engineered a strain with three major virulence factors deleted. The here developed approaches should be readily transportable to other Gram-positive bacteria.\n\nImportanceStreptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is an important opportunistic human pathogen killing over a million people each year. Having the availability of a system capable of easy genome editing would significantly facilitate drug discovery and vaccine candidate efforts. Here, we introduced an easy to use system to perform multiple rounds of genome editing in the pneumococcus by putting the CRISPR-Cas9 system on a temperature-sensitive replicative plasmid. The here used approaches will advance genome editing projects in this important human pathogen.",

Bessel-based optical lattices have generated significant interest owing to their potentially narrow beam waist and propagation-invariant characteristics. Yet, despite their significant use in Lattice Light-Sheet Microscopy, and recent incorporation into commercialized systems, there are very few quantitative reports on their physical properties and how they compare to standard Gaussian illumination beams. Here, we systematically measure the beam properties in transmission of dithered square lattices, which is the most commonly used variant of Lattice Light-Sheet Microscopy, and Gaussian-based light-sheets. After a systematic analysis, we find that square lattices are very similar to Gaussian-based light-sheets in terms of thickness, confocal parameter and propagation length.",

    "abstract": "The microtubule-associated protein (MAP), doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1), is highly expressed in a range of cancers and is a prominent therapeutic target for the development of kinase inhibitors. However, the physiological roles of its kinase activity and how DCLK1 kinase activity is regulated remain elusive. Here we employ in vitro reconstitution with purified proteins to analyze the role of DCLK1 kinase activity in regulating microtubule binding. We find that DCLK1 autophosphorylates a single residue within its C-terminal tail to restrict its kinase activity and prevent aberrant hyperphosphorylation within its microtubule-binding domain. Removal of the C-terminal tail or mutation of this residue causes an increase in phosphorylation largely within the doublecortin 2 (DC2) domain, which dramatically reduces the microtubule affinity of DCLK1. Therefore, autophosphorylation at specific sites within DCLK1 have diametric effects on the molecules ability to associate with microtubules. Overall, our results suggest a mechanism by which DCLK1 modulates its own kinase activity to tune its microtubule binding affinity, providing molecular insights into a unique form of autoregulatory control over microtubule binding activity within the broader family of MAPs. These results provide useful molecular insights for future therapeutic efforts related to DCLK1s role in cancer development and progression.",

    "abstract": "The study of transcription remains one of the centerpieces of modern biology with implications in settings from development to metabolism to evolution to disease. Precision measurements using a host of different techniques including fluorescence and sequencing readouts have raised the bar for what it means to quantitatively understand transcriptional regulation. In particular our understanding of the simplest genetic circuit is sufficiently refined both experimentally and theoretically that it has become possible to carefully discriminate between different conceptual pictures of how this regulatory system works. This regulatory motif, originally posited by Jacob and Monod in the 1960s, consists of a single transcriptional repressor binding to a promoter site and inhibiting transcription. In this paper, we show how seven distinct models of this so-called simple-repression motif, based both on equilibrium and kinetic thinking, can be used to derive the predicted levels of gene expression and shed light on the often surprising past success of the equilibrium models. These different models are then invoked to confront a variety of different data on mean, variance and full gene expression distributions, illustrating the extent to which such models can and cannot be distinguished, and suggesting a two-state model with a distribution of burst sizes as the most potent of the seven for describing the simple-repression motif.",

    "abstract": "Ca2+ release by inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) regulates diverse physiological processes in many cell types. Notably, agonist-stimulated Ca2+ signaling involving IP3Rs can modulate ER export rates through activation of the Ca2+-dependent adaptor ALG-2. It is unknown, however, whether IP3Rs and ALG-2 regulate ER export rates at steady state. Here we report that partial depletion of IP3Rs from normal rat kidney (NRK) epithelial cells caused a marked increase of ER export of the transmembrane cargo VSV-G. Depletion of IP3R-3, the major IP3R isoform in NRK cells, had a larger impact on secretion than the other extant isoform, IP3R-l. Under standard growth conditions, spontaneous cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations usually occurred simultaneously in successive groups of contiguous cells, generating intercellular Ca2+ waves (ICWs) that moved across the monolayer. Unexpectedly, IP3R-3-depleted cells exhibited increased cell participation in this spontaneous signaling. IP3R-3-depleted cells also exhibited increased agonist-dependent Ca2+ signaling, suggesting a general potentiation of the remaining IP3R channels. Increased spontaneous signaling was accompanied by increased ALG-2 and decreased peflin at ER exit sites (ERES), resulting in increased targeting of COPII coat to ERES. Furthermore, the increased secretion rate associated with IP3R depletion required ALG-2. Unexpectedly, IP3R depletion also resulted in partial depletion of ER luminal Ca2+ stores, though this phenomenon was not involved in the secretion change. We conclude that in NRK cells, IP3Rs regulate spontaneous Ca2+ signaling that helps determine the basal secretion rate by modulating COPII targeting to ERES. Furthermore, the IP3R channel density and/or isoform composition significantly impacts this phenomenon.",

Priming is initiated at a heterologous cell-cell contact, the immunological synapse (IS). While it is established that actin dynamics regulates signalling at the T cell side of the contact, little is known about the cytoskeletal contribution on the DC side. We show that that the DC cytoskeleton is decisive for the formation of a multifocal synaptic structure, which correlates with T cell priming efficiency. We demonstrate that DC actin appears in transient foci at the IS and that these foci are dynamized by the WAVE complex. Absence of WAVE in DCs leads to stabilized contacts with T cells, caused by an increase in ICAM1-integrin mediated cell-cell adhesions. This results in a lower number of activated and proliferating T cells. Our results reveal an important role of DC actin in the regulation of synaptic contacts with crucial relevance for full T cell expansion.",

    "abstract": "RationaleThe human heart loses millions of cardiomyocytes after an ischemic injury, but is unable to regenerate the lost tissue. Instead, the injured human heart is repaired by pro-fibrotic fibroblasts that form a large permanent scar. In contrast, the injured zebrafish heart regenerates efficiently without the formation of a permanent scar. While fibroblasts have been shown to be indispensable for zebrafish heart regeneration, very little is known about the mechanisms balancing the fibrotic and regenerative response. A better understanding of these mechanisms could lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic strategies to reduce fibrosis and promote heart regeneration.\n\nObjectiveTo identify novel mechanisms that regulate the balance between cardiac fibrosis and scar-free regeneration.\n\nMethods and ResultsUsing a genetic approach, we first show that zebrafish prrx1b loss-of-function mutants display reduced cardiomyocyte proliferation and impaired heart regeneration. Using a lineage tracing approach, we show that Prrx1b is expressed in tcf21+ epicardial-derived cells localizing around and inside the injured area. Next, we used a single cell RNA-sequencing approach on sorted tcf21+ cells isolated from injured prrx1b-/- and wild-type hearts and identified two distinct fibroblast populations. With combined bioinformatic and histological analysis we found that prrx1b-/- hearts contain an excess of pro-fibrotic fibroblasts that produce TGF-{beta} ligands and collagens, while fewer pro-regenerative Nrg1-expressing fibroblasts are formed. Furthermore, by injecting recombinant NRG1 in prrx1b-/- fish we were able to rescue their cardiomyocyte proliferation defect. Finally, using cultured human fetal epicardial cells and siRNA mediated knock-down of PRRX1 we found that PRRX1 is required for NRG1 induction in human epicardial-derived cells.\n\nConclusionsPrrx1b in the injured heart restricts fibrosis and stimulates regeneration by directing epicardial-derived cells towards a pro-regenerative Nrg1-producing fibroblast state.",

These sites were dominated by bacteria affiliated to the Firmicutes, Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria. ANME-1 and -2 clades were abundant in the carbonates yet their typical syntrophic partners, sulfate reducing bacteria, were not significantly present. Our analysis indicated that methane oxidizers affiliated to the ANME-1 and -2 as well as to the Candidatus Methanoperedens clades, are capable of performing complete methane- and potentially short-chain alkane oxidations independently using oxidized sulfur and nitrogen compounds as terminal electron acceptors. Gammaproteobacteria are hypothetically capable of utilizing oxidized nitrogen compounds in potential syntrophy with methane oxidizing archaea.

    "abstract": "Tsetse flies (genus Glossina), the sole vectors of African trypanosomiasis, are distinct from other disease vectors, and most other insects, due to dramatic evolutionary adaptations required to support their unique life history. These morphological and physiological adaptations are driven by demands associated with their strict dietary and reproductive requirements. Tsetse reproduce by obligate viviparity which entails obligate intrauterine larval development and provisioning of nutrients for the developing larvae. Viviparous reproduction reduces reproductive capacity/rate which also drives increased inter- and intra-sexual competition. This work describes three-dimensional (3D) analysis of viviparity associated morphological adaptations of tsetse female reproductive tract as well as that of male seminal secretions by phase contrast microcomputed tomography (pcMicroCT). Structural features of note include abdominal modifications facilitating the extreme abdominal distention required during blood feeding and pregnancy; abdominal and uterine musculature required for parturition of developed larvae; reduction of ovarian structure and capacity; structural features of the male seminal spermatophore that enhance sperm delivery and inhibition of insemination by competing males; uterine morphological features facilitating expansion and contraction before, during and after pregnancy; analysis of structural optimizations of the milk gland facilitating nutrient incorporation and transfer into the uterus. The use of pcMicroCT provides unprecedented opportunities for examination and discovery of internal morphological features not possible with traditional microscopy techniques and new opportunities for comparative morphological analyses over time and between species.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction are two early symptoms of most neurological diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying microglia-associated neuroinflammation in the regulation of synaptic activity remain obscure. We report here that acute neuroinflammation induced by a single-dose proinflammatory cytokine inducer, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), results in enhanced inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) of glutamatergic neurons, upregulated levels of GABAAR subunits, glutamine synthetase (GS) and vGAT, and downregulated BDNF and pTrkB levels, due to enhanced activation of microglia in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Blockage of microglial activation by minocycline ameliorated LPS-induced aberrant mIPSCs and associated aberrant protein expression and behavior. Exogenous application of BDNF prior to LPS challenge also ameliorated LPS-induced abnormal mIPSCs. Thus, this study elucidates a critical role for microglia in the neurobiology of GABAergic synaptic dysfunction induced by neuroinflammation, revealing a novel GABAergic signaling pathway that might be targeted therapeutically to treat neuroinflammation-induced abnormal synaptic activity and associated aberrant behavior.",

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is characterized by neonatal hypotonia, developmental delay, and hyperphagia/obesity. This disorder is caused by the absence of paternally-expressed gene products from chromosome 15q11-q13. We previously demonstrated that knocking out ZNF274, a KRAB-domain zinc finger protein capable of recruiting epigenetic machinery to deposit the H3K9me3 repressive histone modification, can activate expression from the normally silent maternal allele of SNORD116 in neurons derived from PWS iPSCs. However, ZNF274 has many other targets in the genome in addition to SNORD116. Depleting ZNF274 will surely affect the expression of other important genes and disrupt other pathways. Here we used CRISPR/Cas9 to delete ZNF274 binding sites at the SNORD116 locus to determine whether activation of the maternal copy of SNORD116 could be achieved without altering ZNF274 protein levels. We obtained similar activation of gene expression from the normally silenced maternal allele in neurons derived from PWS iPSCs, compared to ZNF274 knockout, demonstrating that ZNF274 is directly involved in the repression of SNORD116. These results suggest that interfering with ZNF274 binding at the maternal SNORD116 locus is a potential therapeutic strategy for PWS.",

    "abstract": "Visual processing transforms the complex visual world into useful information. Ciona, a close relative of vertebrates, has one of the simplest nervous systems known, yet has a range of visuomotor behaviors. Among them are negative phototaxis and a looming-shadow response. These two behaviors are mediated by separate photoreceptor groups acting via distinct, but overlapping, neural circuits. We show here that processing circuits underlying both behaviors transform visual inputs to generate fold-change detection (FCD) outputs. In FCD, the response scales with the relative fold changes in input, but is invariant to the overall magnitude of the stimulus. Several different circuit architectures can generate FCD responses. Both the behavioral outputs and the putative circuitry for the two visuomotor behaviors point to them using different FCD circuits. Pharmacological treatment points to circuits in the posterior brain vesicle of Ciona, a region we speculate shares homology with the vertebrate midbrain, as important for FCD.",

As projects grow in scale with hundreds, even thousands, of individual participants and scans collected, quantification of brain structures by automated algorithms is becoming the only truly tractable approach. Here, we assessed the spatial and numerical reliability for newly deployed automated segmentation of hippocampal subfields and amygdala nuclei in FreeSurfer 7. In a sample of participants with repeated structural imaging scans (N=923), we found numerical reliability (as assessed by intraclass correlations, ICCs) was reasonable: [~]95% of hippocampal subfields have \"excellent\" numerical reliability (ICCs[&ge;]0.90), however, only 67% of amygdala subnuclei met this same threshold. Spatial reliability was similarly reasonable, with 58% of hippocampal subfields and 44% of amygdala subnuclei having Dice coefficients[&ge;]0.70. Notably, multiple regions had poor numerical and/or spatial reliability. We also examined correlations between spatial reliability and person-level factors (e.g., participant age; T1 image quality). Both sex and image scan quality were related to variations in spatial reliability metrics. Examined collectively, our work suggests caution should be exercised for a few hippocampal subfields and amygdala nuclei with more variable reliability.",

    "abstract": "Throughout the nervous system, the convergence of two or more presynaptic inputs on a target cell is commonly observed. The question we ask here is to what extent converging inputs influence each others structural and functional synaptic plasticity. In complex circuits, isolating individual inputs is difficult because postsynaptic cells can receive thousands of inputs. An ideal model to address this question is the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction where each postsynaptic muscle cell receives inputs from two glutamatergic types of motor neurons (MNs), known as 1b and 1s MNs. Notably, each muscle is unique and receives input from a different combination of 1b and 1s motor neurons. We surveyed synapses on multiple muscles for this reason. Here, we identified a cell-specific promoter to ablate 1s MNs after innervation. Additionally, we genetically blocked 1s innervation. Then we measured 1b MN structural and functional responses using electrophysiology and microscopy. For all muscles, 1s MN ablation resulted in 1b MN synaptic expansion and increased basal neurotransmitter release. This demonstrates that 1b MNs can compensate for the loss of convergent inputs. However, only a subset of 1b MNs showed compensatory evoked activity, suggesting spontaneous and evoked plasticity are independently regulated. Finally, we used DIP- mutants that block 1s MN synaptic contacts; this eliminated robust 1b synaptic plasticity, raising the possibility that muscle co-innervation may define an activity \"set point\" that is referenced when subsequent synaptic perturbations occur. This model can be tested in more complex circuits to determine if co-innervation is fundamental for input-specific plasticity.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTIn complex neural circuits, multiple converging inputs contribute to the output of each target cell. Thus, each input must be regulated, but whether adjacent inputs contribute to this regulation is unclear. To examine input-specific synaptic plasticity in a structurally and functionally tractable system, we turn to the Drosophila neuromuscular circuit. Each muscle is innervated by a unique pair of motor neurons. Removal of one neuron after innervation causes the adjacent neuron to increase synaptic outgrowth and functional output. However, this is not a general feature since each MN differentially compensates. Also, robust compensation requires co-innervation by both neurons. Understanding how neurons respond to perturbations in adjacent neurons will provide insight into nervous system plasticity in both healthy and diseased states.",

    "abstract": "Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is the etiologic agent of numerous high morbidity and high mortality diseases which commonly have a highly proinflammatory pathology. One factor contributing to this inflammation is the GAS protease SpeB, which directly activates the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}), independent of the canonical inflammasome pathway. IL-1{beta} drives neutrophil activation and recruitment that limits bacterial growth and invasion during invasive skin and soft tissue infections like necrotizing fasciitis. GAS also causes pharyngitis (strep throat), and the upper respiratory tract is its primary nidus for growth and transmission. Since the fitness selection for the species is likely primarily for this site, we examined the process of IL-1{beta} activation in the murine nasopharynx. SpeB still activated IL-1{beta}, which was required for neutrophil migration, but this inflammation instead increased GAS replication. Inhibiting IL-1{beta} or depleting neutrophils, which both promote invasive infection, prevented GAS infection of the nasopharynx. Prior antibiotic exposure increased GAS growth in the murine nasopharynx, and antibiotics were sufficient to reverse the attenuation previously observed when IL-1{beta}, neutrophils, or SpeB were not present to drive inflammation. Therefore, the same fundamental mechanism has opposing effects on virulence at different body sites. Invasive disease may be limited in part due to specific adaptations for inducing host inflammation that are beneficial for pharyngitis.\n\nIMPORTANCEOur previous reports showed that Group A Streptococcus (GAS) protease SpeB directly activates the host proinflammatory cytokine IL-1{beta} and this restricts invasive skin infection. The upper respiratory tract is the primary site of GAS colonization and infection, but the host-pathogen interactions at this site are still largely unknown. We provide the first evidence that IL-1{beta}-mediated inflammation promotes upper respiratory tract infection. This provides experimental evidence that the notable inflammation of strep throat, which presents with significant swelling, pain, and neutrophil influx, is not an ineffectual immune response, but rather is a GAS-directed remodeling of this niche for its pathogenic benefit.",

The contribution of copper to female fertility and the underlying molecular aspects of copper deficiency-caused phenotypes are not well-known. We show that among copper deficiency-caused defects in Arabidopsis thaliana were the increased shoot branching, delayed flowering and senescence, and entirely abolished gynoecium fertility. The increased shoot branching of copper-deficient plants was rescued by the exogenous application of auxin or copper. The delayed flowering was associated with the decreased expression of the floral activator, FT. Copper deficiency also decreased the expression of senescence-associated genes, WRKY53 and SAG13, but increased the expression of SAG12. The reduced fertility of copper-deficient plants stemmed from multiple factors including the abnormal stigma papillae development, the abolished gynoecium fertility, and the failure of anthers to dehisce. The latter defect was associated with reduced lignification, the upregulation of copper microRNAs and the downregulation of their targets, laccases, implicated in lignin synthesis. Copper-deficient plants accumulated ROS in pollen and had reduced cytochrome c oxidase activity in leaves. This study opens new avenues for the investigation into the relationship between copper homeostasis, hormone-mediated shoot architecture, gynoecium fertility and copper deficiency-derived nutritional signals leading to the delay in flowering and senescence.\n\nHighlightCopper deficiency alters shoot architecture, delays flowering and senescence, and compromises fertility by altering stigma morphology, disrupting anther lignification and dehiscence, and pollen redox status in Arabidopsis thaliana.",

    "abstract": "Chitin is a homopolymer of {beta}-(1,4)-linked N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) and a major structural component of fungal cell walls. In plants, chitin acts as a microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) that is recognized by lysin motif (LysM)-containing plant cell surface-localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that activate a plethora of downstream immune responses. In order to deregulate chitin-induced plant immunity and successfully establish infection, many fungal pathogens secrete LysM domain-containing effector proteins during host colonization. It was previously shown that the LysM effector Ecp6 from the tomato leaf mould fungus Cladosporium fulvum can outcompete plant PRRs for chitin binding because two of its three LysM domains cooperate to form a composite groove with ultra-high (pM) chitin-binding affinity. However, most functionally characterized LysM effectors contain only two LysMs, including Magnaporthe oryzae MoSlp1, Verticillium dahliae Vd2LysM, and Colletotrichum higginsianum ChElp1 and ChElp2. Here, we performed modelling, structural and functional analyses to investigate whether such dual-domain LysM effectors can also form ultra-high chitin-binding affinity grooves through intramolecular LysM dimerization. However, our study suggests that intramolecular LysM dimerization does not occur. Rather, our data support the occurrence of intermolecular LysM dimerization for these effectors, associated with a significantly lower chitin binding affinity than monitored for Ecp6. Interestingly, the intermolecular LysM dimerization allows for the formation of polymeric complexes in the presence of chitin. Possibly, such polymers may precipitate at infection sites in order to eliminate chitin oligomers, and thus suppress the activation of chitin-induced plant immunity.",

    "abstract": "Resource allocation to reproduction is a critical trait for plant fitness1,2. This trait, called harvest index in the agricultural context3-5, determines how plant biomass is converted to seed yield and consequently financial revenue of numerous major staple crops. While plant diversity has been demonstrated to increase plant biomass6-8, plant diversity effects on seed yield of crops are ambiguous9. This discrepancy could be explained through changes in the proportion of resources invested into reproduction in response to changes in plant diversity, namely through changes of species interactions and microenvironmental conditions10-13. Here we show that increasing crop plant diversity from monoculture over 2- to 4-species mixtures increased annual primary productivity, resulting in overall higher plant biomass and, to a lesser extent, higher seed yield in mixtures compared with monocultures. The difference between the two responses to diversity was due to a reduced reproductive effort of the eight tested crop species in mixtures, possibly because their common cultivars have been bred for maximum performance in monoculture. While crop diversification provides a sustainable measure of agricultural intensification14, the use of currently available cultivars may compromise larger gains in seed yield. We therefore advocate regional breeding programs for crop varieties to be used in mixtures that should exploit facilitative interactions15 among crop species.",

Advanced IPF patients often demonstrate pulmonary hypertension, which severely impairs patients quality of life. The critical physiological roles of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC)-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway have been well characterized in vasodilation and the corresponding therapies and pathway agonists have shown clinical benefits in treating hypertension. In recent years, many preclinical studies have demonstrated anti-fibrotic efficacy of sGC-cGMP activation in various experimental fibrosis models but the molecular basis of the efficacy in these models are not well understood. Also, sGC pathway agonism has demonstrated encouraging clinical benefits in advanced IPF patients (NCT00517933). Here, we have revealed the novel phosphorylation events downstream of sGC activation in human lung fibroblasts using phosphoproteomics. sGCact A, a potent and selective sGC activator, significantly attenuated more than 2,000 phosphorylation sites. About 20% of phosphorylation events, attenuated by transforming growth factor {beta} (TGF{beta}), a master regulator of fibrosis, were further dysregulated in the sGCact A co-treated lung fibroblasts.

Existing approaches for microbial abundance estimation either use accurate but computationally expensive alignment-based approaches for species-level estimation or less accurate but computationally fast alignment-free approaches that fail to classify many reads accurately at the species or strain-level.\n\nHere we introduce CAMMiQ, a novel combinatorial solution to the microbial identification and abundance estimation problem, which performs better than the best used tools on simulated and real datasets with respect to the number of correctly classified reads (i.e., specificity) by an order of magnitude and resolves possible mixtures of similar genomes.\n\nAs we demonstrate, CAMMiQ can better distinguish between single cells deliberately infected with distinct Salmonella strains and sequenced using scRNA-seq reads than alternative approaches. We also demonstrate that CAMMiQ is also more accurate than the best used approaches on a variety of synthetic genomic read data involving some of the most challenging bacterial genomes derived from NCBI RefSeq database; it can distinguish not only distinct species but also closely related strains of bacteria.\n\nThe key methodological innovation of CAMMiQ is its use of arbitrary length, doubly-unique substrings, i.e. substrings that appear in (exactly) two genomes in the input database, instead of fixed-length, unique substrings. To resolve the ambiguity in the genomic origin of doubly-unique substrings, CAMMiQ employs a combinatorial optimization formulation, which can be solved surprisingly quickly. CAMMiQs index consists of a sparsified subset of the shortest unique and doubly-unique substrings of each genome in the database, within a user specified length range and as such it is fairly compact. In short, CAMMiQ offers more accurate genomic identification and abundance estimation than the best used alternatives while using similar computational resources.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/algo-cancer/CAMMiQ",

Moreover, since the LSC experienced by an individual can vary temporally and spatially, this can favour the evolution of SA plasticity. Here, using seven species of the free-living flatworm genus Macrostomum, we document sizable interspecific variation in SA, but neither their mating strategy nor their ability to self-fertilize significantly predicted SA among these species. Since we also found considerable interspecific variation in SA plasticity, we further estimated standardized effect sizes for plasticity in response to i) the presence of mating partners (i.e. in isolation vs. with partners) and ii) the strength of LSC (i.e. in small vs. large groups). We found that self-fertilization predicted SA plasticity with respect to the presence of mating partners, with plasticity being lower for self-fertilizing species. Finally, we showed that interspecific variation in SA is higher than intraspecific variation due to SA plasticity. Our study suggests that both SA and SA plasticity are evolutionarily labile, with self-fertilization predicting the latter in Macrostomum.",

    "abstract": "Animal tracking data are being collected more frequently, in greater detail, and on smaller taxa than ever before. These data hold the promise to increase the relevance of animal movement for understanding ecological processes, but this potential will only be fully realized if their accompanying location error is properly addressed. Historically, coarsely-sampled movement data have proved invaluable for understanding large scale processes (e.g., home range, habitat selection, etc.), but modern fine-scale data promise to unlock far more ecological information. While GPS location error can often be ignored in coarsely sampled data, fine-scale data require more care, and tools to do this have not kept pace. Current approaches to dealing with location error largely fall into two categories--either discarding the least accurate location estimates prior to analysis or simultaneously fitting movement and error parameters in a hidden-state model. In some cases these approaches can provide a level of correction, but they have known limitations, and in some cases they can be worse than doing nothing. Here, we provide a general framework to account for location error in the analysis of triangulated and trilatcralizcd animal tracking data, which includes GPS, Argos Doppler-shift, triangulated VHF, trilatcralized acoustic and cellular location data. We apply our error-modelselection framework to 190 GPS, cellular, and acoustic devices representing 27 models from 14 manufacturers. Collectively, these devices were used to track a wide range of taxa comprising birds, fish, reptiles, and mammals of different sizes and with different behaviors, in urban, suburban, and wild settings. In almost half of the tested device models, error-model selection was necessary to obtain the best performing error model, and in almost a quarter of tested device models, the reported DOP values were actually misinformative. Then, using empirical tracking data from multiple species, we provide an overview of modern, error-informed movement analyses, including continuous-time path reconstruction, home-range distribution, home-range overlap, speed, and distance estimation. Adding to these techniques, we introduce new error-informed estimators for outlier detection and autocorrelation visualization. Because error-induced biases depend on many factors--sampling schedule, movement characteristics, tracking device, habitat, etc.--differential bias can easily confound biological inference and lead researchers to draw false conclusions. We demonstrate how error-informed analyses on calibrated tracking data can provide more accurate estimates are that are insensitive to location error, and allow researchers to use all of their data.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThis study aims to investigate whether dimensional constructs of psychopathology relate to advanced, attenuated or normal patterns of brain development, and to determine whether these constructs share common neurodevelopmental profiles.\n\nMethodsPsychiatric symptom ratings from 9312 youths (8-21 years) were parsed into 7 independent dimensions of clinical psychopathology representing conduct, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, attention, depression, bipolar, and psychosis symptoms. Using a subset of this cohort with structural MRI (n=1313), a normative model of brain morphology was established and the model was then applied to predict the age of youth with clinical symptoms. We investigated whether the deviation of brain-predicted age from true chronological age, called the brain age gap, explained individual variation in each psychopathology dimension.\n\nResultsIndividual variation in the brain age gap significantly associated with clinical dimensions representing psychosis (t=3.16, p=0.0016), obsessive-compulsive symptoms (t=2.5, p=0.01), and general psychopathology (t=4.08, p<0.0001). Greater symptom severity along these dimensions was associated with brain morphology that appeared older than expected for typically developing youth of the same age. Psychopathology dimensions clustered into two modules based on shared brain loci where putative accelerated neurodevelopment was most prominent. Patterns of morphological development were accelerated in frontal cortices for depression, psychosis and conduct symptoms (Module I), whereas acceleration was most evident in subcortex and insula for the remaining dimensions (Module II).\n\nConclusionsOur findings suggest that advanced brain development, particularly in frontal cortex and subcortical nuclei, underpins clinical psychosis and obsessive-compulsive symptoms in youth. Psychopathology dimensions share common neural substrates, despite representing clinically independent symptom profiles.",

    "abstract": "In cancer research and drug development, human tumor-derived cell lines are used as popular model for cancer patients to evaluate the biological functions of genes, drug efficacy, side-effects, and drug metabolism. Using these cell lines, the functional relationship between genes and drug response and prediction of drug response based on genomic and chemical features have been studied. Knowing the drug response on the real patients, however, is a more important and challenging task. To tackle this challenge, some studies integrate data from primary tumors and cancer cell lines to find associations between cell lines and tumors. These studies, however, do not integrate multi-omics datasets to their full extent. Also, several studies rely on a genome-wide correlation-based approach between cell lines and bulk tumor samples without considering the heterogeneous cell population in bulk tumors. To address these gaps, we developed a computational pipeline, CTDPathSim, a pathway activity-based approach to compute similarity between primary tumor samples and cell lines at genetic, genomic, and epigenetic levels integrating multi-omics datasets. We utilized a deconvolution method to get cell type-specific DNA methylation and gene expression profiles and computed deconvoluted methylation and expression profiles of tumor samples. We assessed CTDPathSim by applying on breast and ovarian cancer data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and cancer cell lines data in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) databases. Our results showed that highly similar sample-cell line pairs have similar drug response compared to lowly similar pairs in several FDA-approved cancer drugs, such as Paclitaxel, Vinorelbine and Mitomycin-c. CTDPathSim outperformed state-of-the-art methods in recapitulating the known drug responses between samples and cell lines. Also, CTDPathSim selected higher number of significant cell lines belonging to the same cancer types than other methods. Furthermore, our aligned cell lines to samples were found to be clinical biomarkers for patients survival whereas unaligned cell lines were not. Our method could guide the selection of appropriate cell lines to be more intently serve as proxy of patient tumors and could direct the pre-clinical translation of drug testing into clinical platform towards the personalized therapies. Furthermore, this study could guide the new uses for old drugs and benefits the development of new drugs in cancer treatments.\n\nCCS CONCEPTSO_LIComputational biology\nC_LIO_LIGenomics\nC_LIO_LISystems biology\nC_LIO_LIBioinformatics\nC_LIO_LIGenetics\nC_LI\n\nACM Reference formatBanabithi Bose, Serdar Bozdag. 2020.

    "abstract": "The use of evolutionary profiles to predict protein secondary structure, as well as other protein structural features, has been standard practice since the 1990s. Using profiles in the input of such predictors, in place or in addition to the sequence itself, leads to significantly more accurate predictors. While profiles can enhance structural signals, their role remains somewhat surprising as proteins do not use profiles when folding in vivo. Furthermore, the same sequence-based redundancy reduction protocols initially derived to train and evaluate sequence-based predictors, have been applied to train and evaluate profile-based predictors. This can lead to unfair comparisons since profile may facilitate the bleeding of information between training and test sets. Here we use the extensively studied problem of secondary structure prediction to better evaluate the role of profiles and show that: (1) high levels of profile similarity between training and test proteins are observed when using standard sequence-based redundancy protocols; (2) the gain in accuracy for profile-based predictors, over sequence-based predictors, strongly relies on these high levels of profile similarity between training and test proteins; and (3) the overall accuracy of a profile-based predictor on a given protein dataset provides a biased measure when trying to estimate the actual accuracy of the predictor, or when comparing it to other predictors. We show, however, that this bias can be avoided by implementing a new protocol (EVALpro) which evaluates the accuracy of profile-based predictors as a function of the profile similarity between training and test proteins. Such a protocol not only allows for a fair comparison of the predictors on equally hard or easy examples, but also completely removes the need for selecting arbitrary similarity cutoffs when selecting test proteins. The EVALpro program is available for download from the SCRATCH suite (http://scratch.proteomics.ics.uci.edu).",

    "abstract": "Feral cats are some of the most destructive invasive predators worldwide, particularly in insular environments; hence, density-reduction campaigns are often applied to alleviate the predation mortality they add to native fauna. Density-reduction and eradication efforts are costly procedures with important outcomes for native fauna recovery, so they require adequate planning to be successful. These plans need to include empirical density-reduction models that can guide yearly culling quotas, and resource roll-out for the duration of the culling period. This ensures densities are reduced over the long term and that no resources are wasted. We constructed a stochastic population model with cost estimates to test the relative effectiveness and cost-efficiency of two main culling scenarios for a 10-year eradication campaign of cats on Kangaroo Island, Australia: (1) constant proportional annual cull (one-phase), and (2) high initial culling followed by a constant proportional maintenance cull (two-phase). A one-phase cull of at least 0.35 of the annual population size would reduce the final population to 0.1 of its original size, while a two-phase cull with an initial cull of minimum 0.6 and minimum 0.5 maintenance cull would reduce the final population to 0.01 of its initial size by 2030. Cost estimates varied widely depending on the methods applied (shooting, trapping, aerial poison baits, Felixer poison-delivery system), but using baiting, trapping and Felixers with additional shooting to meet culling quotas was the most cost-effective combination (minimum cost: AU$19.56 million; range: AU$16.87 million-AU$20.69 million). Our model provides an adaptable and general assessment tool for cat reductions in Australia and potentially elsewhere, and provides relative culling costs for the Kangaroo Island programme specifically.",

Neurons with different FR and PC have diverse excitability to stimulation, tuning curve, and synaptic plasticity. Therefore, investigation of the effect of anesthesia on neurons with different FR and PC would be important to understand state-dependent information processing in neuronal circuits.\n\nMethodsTo test how anesthesia affects neurons with diverse PC and FR, we measured single-unit activities in deep layers of primary visual cortex at three levels of anesthesia with desflurane and in wakefulness. Based on PC and FR in wakefulness, neurons were classified into three distinct groups: high PC-high FR (HPHF), low PC-high FR (LPHF), and low PC-low FR (LPLF) neurons.\n\nResultsApplying repeated light flashes as visual stimuli, HPHF neurons showed the strongest early response (FR at 20-150ms post-stimulus) among the three groups, whereas the response of LPHF neurons persisted longest (up to 440ms). Anesthesia profoundly altered PC and FR, and differently affected the three neuron groups: (i) PC and FR became strongly correlated suppressing population-independent spike activity; (ii) Pairwise correlation of spikes between neurons could be predicted by a PC-based raster model suggesting uniform neuron-to-neuron coupling; (iii) Contrary to evoked-potential studies under anesthesia, the flash-induced early response of HPHF neurons was attenuated, and their spike timing was split and delayed; (iv) Late response (FR at 200-400ms post-stimulus) was suppressed both in HPHF and LPHF neurons.\n\nConclusionsAnesthetic-induced association between PC and FR suggests reduced information content in the neural circuit. Altered response of HPHF neurons to visual stimuli suggests that anesthesia interferes with conscious sensory processing in primary sensory cortex.",

    "abstract": "How anesthesia affects cortical neuronal spiking and information transfer could help understand the neuronal basis of conscious state. Recent investigations suggest that global state of the anesthetized brain is not stationary but changes spontaneously at a fixed level of anesthetic concentration. How cortical unit activity changes with dynamically transitioning brain states under anesthesia is unclear. We hypothesized that distinct cortical states are characterized by distinct neuronal spike patterns. Extracellular unit activity was measured with sixty-four-channel silicon microelectrode arrays in cortical layers 5/6 of primary visual cortex of chronically instrumented, freely moving male rats (N = 7) during stepwise reduction of the anesthetic desflurane (6, 4, 2, and 0%). Unsupervised machine learning applied to multi-unit spike patterns revealed five distinct brain states of which four occurred at various anesthetic concentrations and shifted spontaneously. In deeper anesthesia states, the number of active units and overall spike rate decreased while the remaining active units showed increased bursting (excitatory neurons), spike timing variability, unit-to-population correlation and unit-to-unit transfer entropy, especially among putative excitatory units, despite the overall decrease in transfer entropy. A novel desynchronized brain state with increased spike timing variability, entropy and electromyographic activity that occurred mostly in deep anesthesia was discovered. These results provide evidence for distinct unit activity patterns associated with spontaneous changes in local cortical brain states at stationary anesthetic conditions. The appearance of a paradoxical, desynchronized brain state in deep anesthesia contends the prevailing view of monotonic dose-dependent anesthetic effects on the brain.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTRecent studies suggest that spontaneous changes in brain state occur under anesthesia. However, the spiking behavior of cortical neurons associated with such state changes has not been investigated. We found that local brain states defined by multi-unit activity had non-unitary relationship with the current anesthetic level. A paradoxical brain state displaying asynchronous firing pattern and high electromyographic activity was found unexpectedly at high-dose anesthesia. In contrast, the synchronous fragmentation of neuronal spiking appeared to be a robust signature of the state of anesthesia. The findings challenge the assumption of monotonic, anesthetic dose-dependent behavior of cortical neuron populations. They enhance the interpretation of neuroscientific data obtained under anesthesia and understanding of the neuronal basis of anesthetic-induced state of unconsciousness.",

    "abstract": "High-resolution fMRI in the sub-millimeter regime allows researchers to resolve brain activity across cortical layers and columns non-invasively. While these high-resolution data make it possible to address novel questions of directional information flow within and across brain circuits, the corresponding data analyses are challenged by MRI artifacts, including image blurring, image distortions, low SNR, and restricted coverage. These challenges often result in insufficient spatial accuracy of conventional analysis pipelines. Here we introduce a new software suite that is specifically designed for layer-specific functional MRI: LayNii. This toolbox is a collection of command-line executable programs written in C/C++ and is distributed open-source and as pre-compiled binaries for Linux, Windows, and macOS. LayNii is designed for layer-fMRI data that suffer from SNR and coverage constraints and thus cannot be straightforwardly analyzed in alternative software packages. Some of the most popular programs of LayNii contain  layerification and columnarization in the native voxel space of functional data as well as many other layer-fMRI specific analysis tasks: layer-specific smoothing, model-based vein mitigation of GE-BOLD data, quality assessment of artifact dominated sub-millimeter fMRI, as well as analyses of VASO data.\n\nHighlightsO_LIA new software toolbox is introduced for layer-specific functional MRI: LayNii.\nC_LIO_LILayNii is a suite of command-line executable C++ programs for Linux, Windows, and macOS.\nC_LIO_LILayNii is designed for layer-fMRI data that suffer from SNR and coverage constraints.\nC_LIO_LILayNii performs layerification in the native voxel space of functional data.\nC_LIO_LILayNii performs layer-smoothing, GE-BOLD deveining, QA, and VASO analysis.\nC_LI\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=78 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/148080v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (19K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e12e9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fbb564org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@41da13org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1545106_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical abstract\n\nC_FIG",

Currently, effective treatment of infection with SARS-CoV-2 is limited and broad spectrum antiviral therapies to meet other emerging pandemics are absent leaving the World population largely unprotected. Here, we have identified distinct members of the family of polyether ionophore antibiotics with potent ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication and cytopathogenicity in cells. Several compounds from this class displayed more than 100-fold selectivity between viral-induced cytopathogenicity and inhibition of cell viability, however the compound X-206 displayed >500-fold selectivity and was furthermore able to inhibit viral replication even at sub-nM levels. The antiviral mechanism of the polyether ionophores is currently not understood in detail. We demonstrate, through unbiased bioactivity profiling, that their effects on the host cells differ from those of cationic amphiphiles such as hydroxychloroquine. Collectively, our data suggest that polyether ionophore antibiotics should be subject to further investigations as potential broad-spectrum antiviral agents.",

However, a large-scale single-cell screening of SARS-CoV-2 target cells on a wide variety of animals is missing. Here, we constructed the single-cell atlas for 11 representative species in pets, livestock, poultry, and wildlife. Notably, the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 target cells in cat was found considerably higher than other species we investigated and SARS-CoV-2 target cells were detected in multiple cell types of domestic pig, implying the necessity to carefully evaluate the risk of cats during the current COVID-19 pandemic and keep pigs under surveillance for the possibility of becoming intermediate hosts in future coronavirus outbreak. Furthermore, we screened the expression patterns of receptors for 144 viruses, resulting in a comprehensive atlas of virus target cells. Taken together, our work provides a novel and fundamental strategy to screen virus target cells and susceptible species, based on single-cell transcriptomes we generated for domesticated animals and wildlife, which could function as a valuable resource for controlling current pandemics and serve as an early warning system for coping with future infectious disease threats.",

    "abstract": "An effective prophylactic vaccine is urgently needed to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The viral spike, which mediates entry into cells by interacting with the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, is the primary target of most vaccines in development. These vaccines aim to elicit protective immunity against the glycoprotein by use of inactivated virus, vector-mediated delivery of the antigen in vivo, or by direct immunization with the purified antigen following expression in a heterologous system. These approaches are mostly dependent on the growth of mammalian or insect cells, which requires a sophisticated infrastructure that is not generally available in developing countries due to the incumbent costs which are prohibitive. Plant-based subunit vaccine production has long been considered as a cheaper alternative, although low expression yields and differences along the secretory pathway to mammalian cells have posed a challenge to producing certain viral glycoproteins. Recent advances that have enabled many of these constraints to be addressed include expressing the requisite human proteins in plants to support the maturation of the protein of interest. In this study we investigated these approaches to support the production of a soluble and putatively trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike mimetic in Nicotiana benthamiana via transient Agrobacterium-mediated expression. The co-expression of human calreticulin dramatically improved the accumulation of the viral spike, which was barely detectable in the absence of the co-expressed accessory protein. The viral antigen was efficiently processed even in the absence of co-expressed furin, suggesting that processing may have occurred at the secondary cleavage site and was mediated by an endogenous plant protease. In contrast, the spike was not efficiently processed when expressed in mammalian cells as a control, although the co-expression of furin improved processing considerably. This study demonstrates the feasibility of molecular engineering to improve the production of viral glycoproteins in plants, and supports plant-based production of SARS-CoV-2 spike-based vaccines and reagents for serological assays.",

Fluoxetine is a racemate consisting of both stereoisomers, while the S-form is the dominant serotonin reuptake inhibitor. We found that both isomers show similar activity on the virus. Fluoxetine treatment resulted in a decrease in viral protein expression. Furthermore, Fluoxetine inhibited neither Rabies virus, human respiratory syncytial virus replication nor the Human Herpesvirus 8 or Herpes simplex virus type 1 gene expression, indicating that it acts virus-specific. We see the role of Fluoxetine in the early treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients of risk groups.",

    "abstract": "The recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV)-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease (covid19) has posed a great threat to human health. Previous outbreaks of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) from the same CoV family had posed similar threat to human health and economic growth. To date, not even a single drug specific to any of these CoVs has been developed nor any anti-viral vaccine is available for the treatment of diseases caused by CoVs. Subunits present in spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are involved in binding to human ACE2 Receptor which is the primary method of viral invasion. As it has been observed in the previous studies that there are very minor differences in the spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 has an additional furin cleavage site that makes it different from SARS-CoV (Walls et al., 2020). In this study, we have analyzed spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV phylogenetically and subjected them to selection pressure analysis. Selection pressure analysis has revealed some important sites in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike glycoproteins that might be involved in their pathogenicity. Further, we have developed a potential multi-epitope vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing its interactions with HLA-B*15:03 subtype. This vaccine consists of multiple T-helper (TH) cells, B-cells, and Cytotoxic T-cells (CTL) epitopes joined by linkers and an adjuvant to increase its immunogenicity. Conservation of selected epitopes in SARS, MERS, and human hosts, suggests that the designed vaccine could provide cross-protection. The vaccine is designed in silico by following a reverse vaccinology method acknowledging its antigenicity, immunogenicity, toxicity, and allergenicity. The vaccine candidate that we have designed as a result of this work shows promising result indicating its potential capability of simulating an immune response.",

Whilst these changes have been extensively studied, their consequences on transcriptional networks remain to be fully uncovered, especially in dynamic model systems such as stem cells. Here, we take advantage of the FUCCI reporter system to show that chromatin accessibility, gene expression and key transcription factors binding change during cell cycle progression in human Embryonic Stem Cells (hESCs). These analyses reveal that core pluripotency factors such as OCT4, NANOG and SOX2 but also chromatin remodelers such as CTCF and RING1B bind the genome at specific phases of the cell cycle. Importantly, this binding pattern allows differentiation in the G1 phase while preserving pluripotency in the S/G2/M.

Animal models of MIA provide an opportunity to identify molecular pathways that initiate disease processes and lead to neuropathology and behavioral deficits in offspring. MIA-induced behaviors are accompanied by anatomical and neurochemical alterations in adult offspring that parallel those seen in affected human populations.\n\nMethodsWe performed transcriptional profiling and neuroanatomical characterization in a time course across mouse embryonic cortical development, following MIA via single injection of the viral mimic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) at E12.5. Transcriptional changes identified in the cortex of MIA offspring at E17.5 were validated and mapped to cortical neuroanatomy and cell types via protein analysis and immunohistochemistry.\n\nResultsMIA induced strong transcriptomic signatures, including induction of genes associated with hypoxia, immune signaling, and angiogenesis. The acute response identified 6h after the MIA insult was followed by changes in proliferation, neuronal and glial differentiation, and cortical lamination that emerged at E14.5 and peaked at E17.5. Decreased numbers of proliferative cell types in germinal zones and alterations in neuronal and glial cell types across cortical lamina were identified in the MIA-exposed cortex.\n\nConclusionsMIA-induced transcriptomic signatures in fetal offspring overlap significantly with perturbations identified in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), and provide novel insights into alterations in molecular and developmental timing processes linking MIA and neuropathology, potentially revealing new targets for development of novel approaches for earlier diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.",

Coronaviruses have an extensive range of natural hosts and are known to be responsible for a broad spectrum of diseases in multiple species. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has unleashed a global threat to public health and the economy. Coronaviruses are extensively present in birds and mammals, with horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus affinis), being the reservoir for the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 that seems to have resulted from a zoonotic spillover to the human host, causing respiratory infections, lung injury and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome(ARDS). About six coronavirus serotypes are linked with the disease in humans, namely HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh CoV to infect humans. We analyzed the genome sequence of CoV-2 from isolates derived from China as well from India and encountered minute variations in their sequence. A cladogram analysis revealed the predominant strain circulating in India belongs to the A2a clad. We took one such strain (MT012098) and performed a rigorous in-silico genotypic and antigenic analysis to identify its relatedness to other strains. Further, we also performed a detailed prediction for B and T cell epitopes using BepiPred 2.0 server and NetCTL 1.2 server (DTU Bioinformatics), respectively.

Yet despite widespread \"microscopic\" epistasis between the mutations involved, microbial evolution experiments show consistent patterns of fitness increase between replicate lines. Recent work shows that this consistency is driven in part by global patterns of diminishing-returns and increasing-costs epistasis, which make mutations systematically less beneficial (or more deleterious) on fitter genetic backgrounds. However, the mechanistic basis of this \"global\" epistasis remains unknown. Here we show that diminishing-returns and increasing-costs epistasis emerge generically as a consequence of pervasive microscopic epistasis. Our model predicts a specific quantitative relationship between the magnitude of global epistasis and the stochastic effects of microscopic epistasis, which we confirm by re-analyzing existing data. We further show that the distribution of fitness effects takes on a universal form when epistasis is widespread, and introduce a novel fitness landscape model to show how phenotypic evolution can be repeatable despite sequence-level stochasticity.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a major public health concern. A handful of static structures now provide molecular insights into how SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV interact with its host target, which is the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Molecular recognition, binding and function are dynamic processes. To evaluate this, multiple all atom molecular dynamics simulations of at least 500 ns each were performed to better understand the structural stability and interfacial interactions between the receptor binding domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV bound to ACE2. Several contacts were observed to form, break and reform in the interface during the simulations. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 utilizes unique strategies to achieve stable binding to ACE2. Several differences were observed between the residues of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV that consistently interacted with ACE2. Notably, a stable salt bridge between Lys417 of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and Asp30 of ACE2 as well as three stable hydrogen bonds between Tyr449, Gln493, and Gln498 of SARS-CoV-2 and Asp38, Glu35, and Lys353 of ACE2 were observed, which were absent in the SARS-CoV-ACE2 interface. Some previously reported residues, which were suggested to enhance the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2, were not observed to form stable interactions in these simulations. Stable binding to the host receptor is crucial for virus entry. Therefore, special consideration should be given to these stable interactions while designing potential drugs and treatment modalities to target or disrupt this interface.",

    "abstract": "Human ventral temporal cortex (VTC) is a cortical expanse that performs different functions and computations, but is especially critical for visual categorization. Nevertheless, accumulating evidence shows that category-selective regions persist in VTC in the absence of visual experience - for example, in congenitally blind (CB) participants. Despite this evidence, a large body of previous work comparing functional representations in VTC between sighted and CB participants performed univariate analyses at the group level, which assume a homogeneous population - an assumption that has not been formally tested until the present study. Specifically, using fMRI in CB and sighted participants (male and female), we empirically show that at the group level, distributed category representations in VTC are more reliable in the sighted (when viewing visual stimuli) compared to the CB (when hearing auditorily-substituted visual stimuli). Despite these group differences, there is extensive heterogeneity in VTC category representations in the CB to the point that VTC category representations in a subset of CB participants (some who were born without eyes, but not all) are more similar to sighted individuals compared to other CB participants. Together, our findings support a novel idea that driving factors contributing to the formation of VTC category representations in the blind are subject-specific, which complements factors that may generalize across group members. More broadly, the present findings caution conclusions of homogeneity across subjects within a group when performing group neuroimaging analyses without explicitly quantifying individual differences.",

    "abstract": "In mammalian embryogenesis differential gene expression gradually builds the identity and complexity of each tissue and organ system. We systematically quantified mouse polyA-RNA from embryo day E10.5 to birth, sampling 17 whole tissues, enhanced with single-cell measurements for the developing limb. The resulting developmental transcriptome is globally structured by dynamic cytodifferentiation, body-axis and cell-proliferation gene sets, characterized by their promoters transcription factor (TF) motif codes. We decomposed the tissue-level transcriptome using scRNA-seq and found that neurogenesis and haematopoiesis dominate at both the gene and cellular levels, jointly accounting for 1/3 of differential gene expression and over 40% of identified cell types. Integrating promoter sequence motifs with companion ENCODE epigenomic profiles identified a promoter de-repression mechanism unique to neuronal expression clusters and attributable to known and novel repressors. Focusing on the developing limb, scRNA-seq identified 25 known and candidate novel cell types, including progenitor and differentiating states with computationally inferred lineage relationships. We extracted cell type TF networks and complementary sets of candidate enhancer elements by de-convolving whole-tissue IDEAS epigenome chromatin state models. These ENCODE reference data, computed network components and IDEAS chromatin segmentations, are companion resources to the matching epigenomic developmental matrix, available for researchers to further mine and integrate.",

    "abstract": "The cannabinoid system is being researched as a potential pharmaceutical target for a multitude of disorders. The present study examined the effect of indirect and direct cannabinoid agonists on mesolimbic dopamine release and related behaviors in C57BL/6J (B6) mice. The indirect cannabinoid agonist N-arachidonoyl serotonin (AA-5-HT) indirectly agonizes the cannabinoid system by preventing the metabolism of endocannabinoids through fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibition while also inhibiting transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) channels. Effects of AA-5-HT were compared with the direct cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) agonist arachidonoyl-2-chloroethylamide (ACEA). In Experiment 1, mice were pretreated with 7 daily injections of AA-5-HT, ACEA, or vehicle prior to assessments of locomotor activity using open field (OF) testing and phasic dopamine release using in vivo fixed potential amperometry. Chronic exposure to AA-5-HT did not alter locomotor activity or mesolimbic dopamine functioning. Chronic exposure to ACEA did not alter locomotor activity but did decrease phasic dopamine release while increasing the dopaminergic response to cocaine. In Experiment 2, mice underwent AA-5-HT, ACEA, or vehicle conditioned place preference (CPP) then saccharin preference testing, a measure commonly associated with anhedonia. Mice did not develop a CPP or aversion for AA-5-HT or ACEA, and repeated exposure to AA-5-HT or ACEA did not alter saccharin preference. Altogether, the findings suggest that neither of these drugs induce behaviors that are classically associated with abuse liability in mice; however, direct CB1R agonism may play more of a role in mediating mesolimbic dopamine functioning than indirect cannabinoid agonism.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTOrofacial clefts are among the most common human congenital malformations. Irf6 and Esrp1 are two key genes important for palate development, conserved across vertebrates. In the zebrafish, we found that irf6 regulates the expression of esrp1. Using RNAscope, we detailed overlapping Irf6 and Esrp1/2 gene expression in the mouse frontonasal prominence ectoderm, lambda joint periderm, palate and lip epithelium. In the zebrafish, irf6 and esrp1/2 share expression in the pre-gastrulation periderm and the embryonic frontonasal ectoderm, oral epithelium ventral to the anterior neurocranium (ANC), and the developing stomodeum. Genetic disruption of irf6 and esrp1/2 in the zebrafish resulted in cleft of the ANC. In the esrp1/2 zebrafish mutant, cleft of the mouth opening formed and appeared to tether into the ANC cleft. Lineage tracing of the anterior cranial neural crest cells revealed that cleft of the ANC resulted not from migration defect, but from impaired chondrogenesis. Molecular analysis of the aberrant cells localized within the ANC cleft revealed that this cell population espresses sox10, col1a1 and irf6 and is adjacent to cells expressing epithelial krt4. Detailed morphogenetic analysis of mouse Irf6 mutant revealed mesenchymal defects not observed in the Esrp1/2 mutant. Analysis of breeding compound Irf6;Esrp1;Esrp2 mutant suggests that these genes interact where the triple mutant is not observed. Taken together, these studies highlight the complementary analysis of Irf6 and Esrp1/2 in mouse and zebrafish models and captured an unique aberrant embryonic cell population that contributes to cleft pathogenesis. Future work characterizing this unqiue sox10+, col1a1+, irf6+ cell population will yield additional insight into cleft pathogenesis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Investigating variation in genes involved in the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of drugs are key to characterising pharmacogenomic (PGx) relationships. ADME gene variation is relatively well characterised in European and Asian populations, but African populations are under-studied - which has implications for safe and effective drug use in Africa.\n\nThe genetic diversity of ADME genes across sub-Saharan African populations is large. The Southern African population cluster is most distinct from that of far West Africa. PGx strategies based on European variants will be of limited use in African populations.\n\nAlthough established variants are important, PGx must take into account the full range of African variation. This work urges further characterisation of variants in African populations including in vitro and in silico studies, and to consider the unique African ADME landscape when developing precision medicine guidelines and tools for African populations.\n\nAuthor summaryThe ADME genes are a group of genes that play a key role in absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of drugs. Variations in these genes can have a significant impact on drug safety and efficacy. Africa has a high level of genetic variation and is under-studied in drug development, which makes study of variations in these genes in African populations very important. Using a new data set of 458 high-coverage genomes from across Africa, we characterise the extent and impact of variation in the ADME genes, looking at both single nucleotide and copy number variations. We identified 343,368 variants, including 40,692 novel variants, and 930 coding variants which are predicted to have high impact on function. Our discovery curves indicate that there will be considerable value in sequencing more African genomes. Moreover, relatively few of these novel variants are captured on common genotyping arrays. We show that there is considerable diversity within Africa in some important genes, and this will have significant consequences for the emerging field of precision medicine in Africa.",
