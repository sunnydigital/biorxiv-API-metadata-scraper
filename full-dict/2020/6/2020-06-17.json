    "abstract": "Escherichia coli Strain Type 131 are a globally disseminated environmental E. coli that has been linked to the capture and spread of plasmid mediated blaCTX-M type extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBLs). Accurately identifying such resistance genes in their wider genetic context provides a greater understanding of the mechanisms of selection and persistence in the environment. In this study we use a novel DNA extraction and enrichment method in combination with a custom long-read scaffold hybrid-assembly and polishing pipe line to identify the genetic context of the plasmid borne blaCTX-M gene previously identified in an ST131 environmental E. coli isolate. This has allowed us to discern the complete structure of a ~100kb environmental plasmid and further resolve the blaCTX-M variant to the group 9 blaCTX-M-27 gene. The upstream IS26 insertion element associated with the global capture and dissemination of blaCTX-M-15 was also identified in proximity to blaCTX-M-27. Furthermore, the lack of conjugative machinery identified on this plasmid, in combination with a toxin-antitoxin and plasmid partitioning system, indicates a mechanism of vertical transmission to maintain persistence in a population.",

    "abstract": "Current state-of-the-art object recognition models are largely based on convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, which are loosely inspired by the primate visual system. However, these CNNs can be fooled by imperceptibly small, explicitly crafted perturbations, and struggle to recognize objects in corrupted images that are easily recognized by humans. Here, by making comparisons with primate neural data, we first observed that CNN models with a neural hidden layer that better matches primate primary visual cortex (V1) are also more robust to adversarial attacks. Inspired by this observation, we developed VOneNets, a new class of hybrid CNN vision models. Each VOneNet contains a fixed weight neural network front-end that simulates primate V1, called the VOneBlock, followed by a neural network back-end adapted from current CNN vision models. The VOneBlock is based on a classical neuroscientific model of V1: the linear-nonlinear-Poisson model, consisting of a biologically-constrained Gabor filter bank, simple and complex cell nonlinearities, and a V1 neuronal stochasticity generator. After training, VOneNets retain high ImageNet performance, but each is substantially more robust, outperforming the base CNNs and state-of-the-art methods by 18% and 3%, respectively, on a conglomerate benchmark of perturbations comprised of white box adversarial attacks and common image corruptions. Finally, we show that all components of the VOneBlock work in synergy to improve robustness. While current CNN architectures are arguably brain-inspired, the results presented here demonstrate that more precisely mimicking just one stage of the primate visual system leads to new gains in ImageNet-level computer vision applications.",

    "abstract": "Ermin is an actin-binding protein found almost exclusively in the central nervous system (CNS) as a component of myelin sheaths. Although Ermin has been predicted to play a role in the formation and stability of myelin sheaths, this has not been directly examined in vivo. Here we show that Ermin is essential for myelin sheath integrity and normal saltatory conduction. Loss of Ermin in mice caused de-compacted and fragmented myelin sheaths and led to slower conduction along with progressive neurological deficits. RNA sequencing of the corpus callosum, the largest white matter structure in the CNS, pointed to inflammatory activation in aged Ermin-deficient mice, which was corroborated by increased levels of microgliosis and astrogliosis. The inflammatory milieu and myelin abnormalities were further associated with increased susceptibility to immune-mediated demyelination insult in Ermin knockout mice. Supporting a possible role of Ermin deficiency in inflammatory white matter disorders, a rare inactivating mutation in the ERMN gene was identified in multiple sclerosis patients. Our findings demonstrate a critical role for Ermin in maintaining myelin integrity. Given its near exclusive expression in myelinating oligodendrocytes, Ermin deficiency represents a compelling \"inside-out\" model of inflammatory dysmyelination and may offer a new paradigm for the development of myelin stability-targeted therapies.",

    "abstract": "Most contemporary models of value-based decisions are built on value estimates that are typically self-reported by the decision maker. Such models have been successful in accounting for choice accuracy and response time, and more recently choice confidence. The fundamental driver of such models is choice difficulty, which is almost always defined as the absolute value difference between the subjective value ratings of the options in a choice set. Yet a decision maker is not necessarily able to provide a value estimate with the same degree of certainty for each option that he encounters. We propose that choice difficulty is determined not only by absolute value distance of choice options, but also by their value certainty. In this study, we first demonstrate the reliability of the concept of an option-specific value certainty using three different experimental measures. We then demonstrate the influence that value certainty has on choice, including accuracy (consistency), choice confidence, response time, and choice-induced preference change (i.e., the degree to which value estimates change from pre- to post-choice evaluation). We conclude with a suggestion of how popular contemporary models of choice (e.g., race model, drift-diffusion model) could be improved by including option-specific value certainty as one of their inputs.",

    "abstract": "Methotrexate carried in lipid core nanoparticles (LDE-MTX) is a low toxicity compound effective in reducing inflammation and secondary damage in experimental models of arthritis, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, cardiac allograft vasculopathy and other pathological conditions. Nevertheless, whether it is neuroprotective after stroke is unknown. Here, we explored whether LDE-MTX could cross blood brain barrier (BBB) to exert anti-inflammatory and neuroprotecive effects after experimental cortical stroke in rats. Tissue uptake was assessed by injecting radioactively labeled-LDE through the caudal vein into both sham (n=18) and adult Wistar rats submitted to endothelin-1 (ET-1)-induced cortical stroke (n=11). To address possible neuroprotective effects of LDE-MTX after stroke, 10 adult male Wistar rats were randomly allocated in two groups: animals treated with LDE-MTX (1 mg/kg, i.v., n=5) or LDE-alone (i.v., n=5) at 4 hours after stroke induction. Animals were perfused with 0.9% saline and 4% paraformaldehyde at 7 days post-injury. Histopathology was assessed by cresyl violet staining. Mature neuronal bodies (anti-NeuN), astrocytes (anti-GFAP) and microglia (anti-Iba1) were immunolabeled by immunohistochemistry. Scintigraphy technique revealed accumulation of tritiated LDE in different brain regions and in non-neural organs without overt toxicity in both sham and ischemic rats. LDE-MTX treatment induced a 10-fold (1000%) reduction in microglial activation in the ischemic cortex and afforded a 319% increase in neuronal preservation in the ischemic periinfarct region compared to LDE-alone group. There was no effect of LDE-MTX treatment on primary infarct area and astrocytosis. The results suggest that LDE-MTX formulation must be considered a very promising neuroprotective agent for ischemic stroke. Future studies using different concentrations and longer survival times are needed before assessing the suitability of LDE-MTX as a neuroprotective agent for human stroke.",

However, to date, its pathophysiology remains poorly understood.Objective Our goal was to investigate the role of microvessel disease in the pathophysiology of diastolic dysfunction.Findings To do so, we used Leptin receptor deficient (Leprdb/db) female mice as a model of diastolic dysfunction. In these mice, the increased end diastolic pressure (EDP) signing diastolic dysfunction is associated with vascular leakage, endothelial cell activation and leucocyte infiltration. Strikingly, a RNA sequencing analysis of the cardiac vascular fraction of both Leprdb/db and control female mice confirmed endothelial dysfunction and systemic inflammation but also revealed a strong increase in several mast cell markers (notably FceR1a, Tryptase and Chymase). We then histologically confirmed an accumulation of activated mast cells in the heart of Leprdb/db mice. Importantly, mast cell degranulation inhibition reduced EDP, vascular leakage and leucocyte infiltration in Leprdb/db mice.Conclusion Mast cells play a critical role in the development of cardiac microvessel disease and diastolic dysfunction.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Plant pathogens secrete effector molecules during host invasion to promote host colonization. However, some of these effectors become recognized by host receptors, encoded by resistance genes, to mount defense response and establish immunity. Recently, a novel resistance was identified in tomato, mediated by the single dominant V2 locus, to control strains of the soil-borne vascular wilt fungus Verticillium dahliae that belong to race 2. We performed comparative genomics between race 2 strains and resistance-breaking race 3 strains to identify the avirulence effector that activates V2 resistance, termed Av2. We identified 277 kb of race 2-specific sequence comprising only two genes that encode predicted secreted proteins, both of which are expressed by V. dahliae during tomato colonization. Subsequent functional analysis based on genetic complementation into race 3 isolates confirmed that one of the two candidates encodes the avirulence effector Av2 that is recognized in V2 tomato plants. The identification of Av2 will not only be helpful to select tomato cultivars that are resistant to race 2 strains of V. dahliae, as the corresponding V2 resistance gene has not yet been mapped, but also to monitor adaptations in the V. dahliae population to deployment of V2-containing tomato cultivars in agriculture.",

Although their uncultured genetic diversity has been estimated by planetary-scale metagenome sequencing and subsequent reconstruction of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), this approach has yet to be applied for eukaryote-enriched polar and non-polar phytoplankton communities. Here, we have assembled draft prokaryotic and eukaryotic MAGs from environmental DNA extracted from chlorophyll a maximum layers in the surface ocean across the Arctic Circle in the Atlantic. From 679 Gbp and estimated 50 million genes in total, we recovered 140 MAGs of medium to high quality. Although there was a strict demarcation between polar and non-polar MAGs, adjacent sampling stations in each environment on either side of the Arctic Circle had MAGs in common. Furthermore, phylogenetic placement revealed eukaryotic MAGs to be more diverse in the Arctic whereas prokaryotic MAGs were more diverse in the Atlantic south of the Arctic Circle. Approximately 60% of protein families were shared between polar and non-polar MAGs for both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, eukaryotic MAGs had more protein families unique to the Arctic whereas prokaryotic MAGs had more families unique to south of the Arctic circle. Thus, our study enabled us to place differences in functional plankton diversity in a genomic context to reveal that the evolution of these MAGs likely was driven by significant differences in the seascape on either side of an ecosystem boundary that separates polar from non-polar surface ocean waters in the North Atlantic.",

Our cryo-electron microscopy map reveals structural transitions required for oligomerization, which include the lateral movement of a key amphipathic helix.

However, scaffold-based bone tissue constructs have had limited clinical translation due to constrains in supporting scaffolds, minimal flexibility in tuning scaffold degradation, and low achievable cell seeding density as compared with native bone tissue. Here, we demonstrate a pragmatic and scalable bottom-up method, inspired from embryonic developmental biology, to build three-dimensional (3D) scaffold-free constructs using spheroids as building blocks. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were introduced to human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) (hMSC/HUVEC) and spheroids were fabricated by an aggregate culture system. Bone tissue was generated by induction of osteogenic differentiation in hMSC/HUVEC spheroids for 10 days, with enhanced osteogenic differentiation and cell viability in the core of the spheroids compared to hMSC-only spheroids. Aspiration-assisted bioprinting (AAB) is a new bioprinting technique which allows precise positioning of spheroids (11% with respect to the spheroid diameter) by employing aspiration to lift individual spheroids and bioprint them onto a hydrogel. AAB facilitated bioprinting of scaffold-free bone tissue constructs using the pre-differentiated hMSC/HUVEC spheroids. These constructs demonstrated negligible changes in their shape for two days after bioprinting owing to the reduced proliferative potential of differentiated stem cells. Bioprinted bone tissues showed interconnectivity with actin-filament formation and high expression of osteogenic and endothelial-specific gene factors. This study thus presents a viable approach for 3D bioprinting of complex-shaped geometries using spheroids as building blocks, which can be used for various applications including but not limited to, tissue engineering, organ-on-a-chip and microfluidic devices, drug screening and, disease modeling.",

    "abstract": "Lateral gene transfer (LT) from viruses to eukaryotic cells is a well-recognized phenomenon. Somatic integrations of viruses have been linked to persistent viral infection and genotoxic effects, including various types of cancer. As a consequence, several bioinformatic tools have been developed to identify viral sequences integrated into the human genome. Viral sequences that integrate into germline cells can be transmitted vertically, be maintained in host genomes and be co-opted for host functions. Endogenous viral elements (EVEs) have long been known, but the extent of their widespread occurrence has only been recently appreciated. Modern genomic sequencing analyses showed that eukaryotic genomes may harbor hundreds of EVEs, which derive not only from DNA viruses and retroviruses, but also from nonretroviral RNA viruses and are mostly enriched in repetitive regions of the genome. Despite being increasingly recognized as important players in different biological processes such as regulation of expression and immunity, the study of EVEs in non-model organisms has rarely gone beyond their characterization from annotated reference genomes because of the lack of computational methods suited to solve signals for EVEs in repetitive DNA. To fill this gap, we developed ViR, a pipeline which ameliorates the detection of integration sites by solving the dispersion of reads in genome assemblies that are rich of repetitive DNA. Using paired-end whole genome sequencing (WGS) data and a user-built database of viral genomes, ViR selects the best candidate couples of reads supporting an integration site by solving the dispersion of reads resulting from intrasample variability. We benchmarked ViR to work with sequencing data from both single and pooled DNA samples and show its applicability using WGS data of a non-model organism, the arboviral vector Aedes albopictus. Viral integrations predicted by ViR were molecularly validated supporting the accuracy of ViR results. Additionally, ViR can be readily adopted to detect any LT event providing ad hoc non-host sequences to interrogate.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC) is the leading cause of gynecologic cancer death. Despite many patients achieving remission with first-line therapy, up to 80% of patients will recur and require additional treatment. Retrospective clinical analysis of OC patients indicates antibiotic use during chemotherapy treatment is associated with poor overall survival. We assessed whether antibiotic (ABX) therapy would impact growth of EOC and sensitivity to cisplatin in murine models. Immune competent or compromised mice were given control or ABX containing water (metronidazole, ampicillin, vancomycin, and neomycin) before being intraperitoneally injected with murine EOC cells. Stool was collected to confirm microbiome disruption and tumors were monitored, and cisplatin therapy was administered weekly until endpoint. EOC tumor-bearing mice demonstrate accelerated tumor growth and resistance to cisplatin therapy in ABX treated compared with nonABX treatment. Stool analysis indicated most gut microbial species were disrupted by ABX treatment except for ABX resistant bacteria. To test for role of the gut microbiome, cecal microbiome transplants (CMTs) of microbiota derived from ABX or nonABX treated mice were used to recolonize the microbiome of ABX treated mice. nonABX cecal microbiome was sufficient to ameliorate the chemoresistance and survival of ABX treated mice indicative of a gut derived tumor suppressor. Mechanistically, tumors from ABX treated compared to nonABX treated mice contained a high frequency of cancer stem cells that were augmented by cisplatin. These studies indicate an intact microbiome provides a gut derived tumor suppressor and maintains chemosensitivity that is disrupted by ABX treatment.\n\nSignificancePlatinum resistance is associated with poor prognosis and reduced therapeutic options for ovarian cancer patients. We identifed a tumor suppressive role of the gut microbiome that is disrupted upon antibiotic therapy.",

Evaluating these immunogens requires a thorough understanding of the antigenic sites targeted by the polyclonal antibody (pAb) response, which single particle electron microscopy (EM) can sensitively detect. Here, we employed EM polyclonal epitope mapping (EMPEM) to extensively characterize the pAb response to hemagglutinin (HA) after H5N1 immunization in humans. Cross-reactive pAbs originating from memory B cells immediately bound the stem of HA and persisted for over a year post vaccination. In contrast, de novo pAb responses to multiple sites on the head of HA, which targeted previously determined key neutralizing sites on H5 HA, expanded after the second immunization and waned quickly. Thus, EMPEM provides a robust tool for comprehensively tracking the specificity and durability of immune responses elicited by novel universal influenza vaccine candidates.",

    "abstract": "From insects to mice, oocytes develop within cysts alongside nurse-like sister germ cells. Prior to fertilization, the nurse cells cytoplasmic contents are transported into the oocyte, which grows as its sister cells regress and die. Although critical for fertility, the biological and physical mechanisms underlying this transport process are poorly understood. Here, we combined live imaging of germline cysts, genetic perturbations, and mathematical modeling to investigate the dynamics and mechanisms that enable directional and complete cytoplasmic transport in Drosophila melanogaster egg chambers. We discovered that during  nurse cell (NC) dumping, most cytoplasm is transported into the oocyte independently of changes in myosin-II contractility, with dynamics instead explained by an effective Young-Laplaces law, suggesting hydraulic transport induced by baseline cell surface tension. A minimal flow network model inspired by the famous two-balloon experiment and genetic analysis of a myosin mutant correctly predicts the directionality of transport time scale, as well as its intercellular pattern. Long thought to trigger transport through  squeezing, changes in actomyosin contractility are required only once cell volume is reduced by [~]75%, in the form of surface contractile waves that drive NC dumping to completion. Our work thus demonstrates how biological and physical mechanisms cooperate to enable a critical developmental process that, until now, was thought to be a mainly biochemically regulated phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "In the adult human brain, six isoforms of the microtubule-associated protein TAU are expressed, which result from alternative splicing of exons 2, 3 and 10 of the MAPT gene. These isoforms differ in the number of N-terminal inserts (0N, 1N, 2N) and C-terminal repeat domains (3R or 4R) and are differentially expressed depending on the brain region and developmental stage. Although all TAU isoforms can aggregate and form neurofibrillary tangles, some tauopathies, such as Picks Disease and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, are characterized by the accumulation of specific TAU isoforms. The influence of the individual TAU isoforms in a cellular context, however, is understudied. In this report, we investigated the subcellular localization of the human-specific TAU isoforms in primary neurons, and analyzed TAU isoform-specific effects on cell area and microtubule dynamics in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Our results show that 2N-TAU isoforms are particularly retained from axonal sorting and that axonal enrichment is independent from the number of repeat domains, but that the additional repeat domain of 4R-TAU isoform results in a general reduction of cell size and an increase of microtubule counts in cells expressing 4R-TAU isoforms. Our study points out that individual TAU isoforms may influence microtubule dynamics differentially both by different sorting patterns as well as by direct effects on microtubule dynamics.",

He exhibits marked expressive and receptive problems, which affect to both structural aspects of language (notably, inflectional morphology, complex syntax, and sentence semantics), and to functional aspects (pragmatics). These problems might result from a severe underlying deficit in working memory. Regarding the molecular causes of the observed symptoms, they might result from the altered expression of selected genes involved in procedural learning, particularly, some of components of the SLIT/ROBO/FOXP2 network, strongly related to the development and evolution of language. Dysregulation of specific components of this network can result in turn from an altered interaction between DOCK8, affected by the microduplication in 9p24.3 borne by our proband, and CDC42, acting as the hub component of the network encompassing language-related genes. Still, some genes found strongly upregulated in the subject and not related to these genes, particularly NRCAM, can contribute to the observed problems in the language domain, as well as to specific features of the proband, particularly, his impulsivity.",

    "abstract": "We present a general physicochemical sampling model for olfaction, based on established pharmacological laws, in which arbitrary combinations of odorant ligands and receptors can be generated and their individual and collective effects on odor representations and olfactory performance measured. Individual odor ligands exhibit receptor-specific affinities and efficacies; that is, they may bind strongly or weakly to a given receptor, and can act as strong agonists, weak agonists, partial agonists, or antagonists. Ligands interacting with common receptors compete with one another for dwell time; these competitive interactions appropriately simulate the degeneracy that fundamentally defines the capacities and limitations of odorant sampling. The outcome of these competing ligand-receptor interactions yields a pattern of receptor activation levels, thereafter mapped to glomerular presynaptic activation levels based on the convergence of sensory neuron axons. The metric of greatest interest is the mean discrimination sensitivity, a measure of how effectively the olfactory system at this level is able to recognize a small change in the physicochemical quality of a stimulus.\n\nThis model presents several significant outcomes, both expected and surprising. First, adding additional receptors reliably improves the systems discrimination sensitivity. Second, in contrast, adding additional ligands to an odor scene initially can improve discrimination sensitivity, but eventually will reduce it as the number of ligands increases. Third, the presence of antagonistic ligand-receptor interactions produced clear benefits for sensory system performance, generating higher absolute discrimination sensitivities and increasing the numbers of competing ligands that could be present before discrimination sensitivity began to be impaired. Finally, the model correctly reflects and explains the modest reduction in odor discrimination sensitivity exhibited by transgenic mice in which the specificity of glomerular targeting by primary olfactory neurons is partially disrupted.\n\nAuthor SummaryWe understand most sensory systems by comparing the responses of the system against objective external physical measurements. For example, we know that our ability to distinguish small changes in color is greater for some colors than for others, and that we can distinguish sounds more acutely when they are within the range of pitches used for speech. Similar principles presumably apply to the sense of smell, but odorous chemicals are harder to physically quantify than light or sound because they cannot be organized in terms of a straightforward physical variable like wavelength or frequency. That said, the physical properties of interactions between chemicals and cellular receptors (such as those in the olfactory system) are well understood. What we lack is a systematic framework within which these pharmacological principles can be organized to study odor sampling in the way that we have long studied visual and auditory sampling. We here propose and describe such a framework for odor sampling, and show that it successfully replicates some established but unexplained experimental results.",

Numerous studies have interrogated the inner workings of RNAP, and mutations in genes encoding RNAP drive adaptation of Escherichia coli to many health- and industry-relevant environments, yet a paucity of systematic analyses has hampered our understanding of the fitness benefits and trade-offs from altering RNAP function. Here, we conduct a chemical-genetic analysis of a library of RNAP mutants. We discover phenotypes for non-essential insertions, show that clustering mutant phenotypes increases their predictive power for drawing functional inferences, and illuminate a connection between transcription and cell division. Our findings demonstrate that RNAP chemical-genetic interactions provide a general platform for interrogating structure-function relationships in vivo and for identifying physiological trade-offs of mutations, including those relevant for disease and biotechnology.

However, cells can also dynamically control their cell polarity. Here, we ask how an upstream signaling system can switch the orientation of a polarized pattern. We use a mathematical model of a core polarity system based on three proteins as the basis to study different mechanisms of signal-induced polarity switching. The analysis of this model reveals four general classes of switching mechanisms with qualitatively distinct behaviors: the transient oscillator switch, the reset switch, the prime-release switch, and the push switch. Each of these regulatory mechanisms effectively implements the function of a spatial toggle switch, however with different characteristics in their nonlinear and stochastic dynamics. We identify these characteristics and also discuss experimental signatures of each type of switching mechanism.",

    "abstract": "1The identification of pleiotropic loci and the interpretation of the associations at these loci are essential to understand the shared etiology of related traits. A common approach to map pleiotropic loci is to use an existing meta-analysis method to combine summary statistics of multiple traits. This strategy does not take into account the complex genetic architectures of traits such as genetic correlations and heritabilities. Furthermore, the interpretation is challenging because phenotypes often have different characteristics and units. We propose PLEIO, a summary-statistic-based framework to map and interpret pleiotropic loci in a joint analysis of multiple traits. Our method maximizes power by systematically accounting for the genetic correlations and heritabilities of the traits in the association test. Any set of related phenotypes, binary or quantitative traits with differing units, can be combined seamlessly. In addition, our framework offers interpretation and visualization tools to help downstream analyses.

    "abstract": "Virus evolution drives the annual influenza epidemics in human population worldwide. However, it has been challenging to evaluate the mutation effect of the influenza virus on evading the population immunity. In this study, we introduce a novel statistical and computational approach to measure the dynamic molecular determinants underlying epidemics by the effective mutations (EMs), and account for the time of waning mutation advantage against herd immunity by the effective mutation periods (EMPs). Extensive analysis is performed on the genome and epidemiology data of 13-year worldwide H3N2 epidemics involving nine regions in four continents. We showed that the identified EM processed similar profile in geographically adjacent regions, while only 40% are common to Europe, North America, Asia and Oceania, indicating that the regional specific mutations also contributed significantly to the global H3N2 epidemics. The mutation dynamics calibrated that around 90% of the common EMs underlying global epidemics were originated from South East Asia, led by Thailand and India, and the rest were originated from North America. New Zealand was found to be the dominate sink region of H3N2 circulation, followed by UK. All regions might act as the intersection in the H3N2 transmission network. The proposed methodology provided a way to characterize key amino acids from the genetic epidemiology point of view. This approach is not restricted by the genomic region or type of the virus, and will find broad applications in identifying therapeutic targets for combating infectious diseases.",

    "abstract": "Loss of genetic variability is a steadily increasing challenge in tree breeding programs due to the repeated use of a reduced number of founder genotypes. High-quality pedigree data of 222 almond [Prunus dulcis (Miller) D.A. Webb, syn. P. amygdalus (L) Batsch] cultivars and breeding selections were used to study global genetic variability in modern breeding programs from Argentina, Australia, France, Greece, Israel, Italy, Russia, Spain and the USA. Inbreeding coefficients, pairwise relatedness and genetic contribution were calculated for these genotypes. The results reveal two mainstream breeding lines based on three cultivars from two different geographical regions:  Tuono- Cristomorto (local landraces from Puglia, Italy) and  Nonpareil (chance seedling selected in California, USA, from French original stock). Direct descendants from  Tuono or  Cristomorto number 75 (sharing 30 descendants), while  Nonpareil has 72 direct descendants. The mean inbreeding coefficient of the analyzed genotypes was 0.036, with 13 genotypes presenting a high inbreeding coefficient, over 0.250. Breeding programs from the USA, France and Spain showed inbreeding coefficients of 0.067, 0.050 and 0.034, respectively. According to their genetic contribution, modern cultivars from Israel, France, the USA, Spain and Australia, trace back to six, five, four, four and two main founding genotypes respectively. Among the group of 65 genotypes carrying the Sf allele for self-compatibility, the mean relatedness coefficient was 0.133, with  Tuono as the main founding genotype (23.75% of total genetic contribution). Increasing as well as preserving current genetic variability is required in almond breeding programs worldwide to assure genetic gain and continuing breeding progress. Breeding objectives, apart from high and efficient productivity, should include disease resistance and adaptation to climate change. Ultimately, any new commercial almond cultivar has to be economically viable and breeders play a critical role in achieving this goal.",

By analyzing a multi-cancer cohort of 1,525 ICI-treated patients, we identified 12 driver genes in 6 cancer types associated with treatment outcomes, including genes involved in oncogenic signaling pathways (NOTCH, WNT, FGFR) and chromatin remodeling. Mutations of PIK3CA, PBRM1, SMARCA4, and KMT2D were associated with worse outcomes across multiple cancer types. In comparison, genes showing cancer-specific associations--such as KEAP1, BRAF, and RNF43--harbored distinct variant types and variants, some of which were individually associated with outcomes. In colorectal cancer, a common RNF43 indel was a putative neoantigen associated with higher immune infiltration and favorable ICI outcomes. Finally, we showed that selected mutations were associated with PD-L1 status and could further stratify patient outcomes beyond MSI or TMB, highlighting their potential as biomarkers for immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms linking maternal stress in pregnancy with infant neurodevelopment in a sexually dimorphic manner are poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that maternal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, measured by hair cortisol concentration, is associated with microstructure, structural connectivity and volume of the infant amygdala. In 78 human mother-infant dyads, maternal hair was sampled postnatally, and infants underwent magnetic resonance imaging at term-equivalent age. Higher hair cortisol concentration was associated with higher left amygdala fractional anisotropy ({beta}=0.677, p=0.010), lower left amygdala orientation dispersion index ({beta}=-0.597, p=0.034), and higher fractional anisotropy in connections between the right amygdala and putamen ({beta}=0.475, p=0.007) in girls compared to boys. Maternal cortisol during pregnancy is related to newborn amygdala architecture and connectivity in a sexually dimorphic manner. Given the fundamental role of the amygdala in the emergence of emotion regulation, these findings offer new insights into mechanisms linking maternal stress with adverse neuropsychiatric outcomes of children.\n\nImpact StatementPrenatal stress is transmitted to infant development through cortisol, which imparts sex-specific effects on the development and connectivity of the amygdalae.",

The impact of age, sex, and pain on -opioid receptor (MOR) expression and binding in the ventrolateral PAG (vlPAG) was also examined using immunohistochemistry and receptor autoradiography. Intraplantar administration of Complete Freunds adjuvant induced comparable levels of edema and hyperalgesia in adult (2-3mos) and aged (16-18mos) male and female rats. Morphine potency was highest in adult males, with a two-fold decrease in morphine EC50 observed in aged versus adult males (10.22mg/kg versus 5.19mg/kg). Adult and aged female rats also exhibited significantly higher EC50 values (10.69 mg/kg and 9.00 mg/kg, respectively) compared to adult males. The upward shift in EC50 from adult to aged males was paralleled by a reduction in vlPAG MOR expression and binding. The observed age-related reductions in morphine potency and vlPAG MOR expression and binding have significant implications in pain management in the aged population.",

    "abstract": "Both electroencephalography (EEG) and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) are non-invasive methods that show complementary aspects of human brain activity. Despite measuring different proxies of brain activity, both the measured blood-oxygenation (fMRI) and neurophysiological recordings (EEG) are indirectly coupled. The electrophysiological and BOLD signal can map the underlying functional connectivity structure at the whole brain scale at different timescales. Previous work demonstrated a moderate but significant correlation between resting-state functional connectivity of both modalities, however there is a wide range of technical setups to measure simultaneous EEG-fMRI and the reliability of those measures between different setups remains unknown. This is true notably with respect to different magnetic field strengths (low and high field) and different spatial sampling of EEG (medium to high-density electrode coverage).\n\nHere, we investigated the reproducibility of the bimodal EEG-fMRI functional connectome in the most comprehensive resting-state simultaneous EEG-fMRI dataset compiled to date including a total of 72 subjects from four different imaging centers. Data was acquired from 1.5T, 3T and 7T scanners with simultaneously recorded EEG using 64 or 256 electrodes. We demonstrate that the whole-brain monomodal connectivity reproducibly correlates across different datasets and that a moderate crossmodal correlation between EEG and fMRI connectivity of r{approx}0.3 can be reproducibly extracted in low- and high-field scanners. The crossmodal correlation was strongest in the EEG-{beta} frequency band but exists across all frequency bands. Both homotopic and within intrinsic connectivity network (ICN) connections contributed the most to the crossmodal relationship.\n\nThis study confirms, using a considerably diverse range of recording setups, that simultaneous EEG-fMRI offers a consistent estimate of multimodal functional connectomes in healthy subjects that are dominantly linked through a functional core of ICNs across spanning across the different timescales measured by EEG and fMRI. This opens new avenues for estimating the dynamics of brain function and provides a better understanding of interactions between EEG and fMRI measures. This observed level of reproducibility also defines a baseline for the study of alterations of this coupling in pathological conditions and their role as potential clinical markers.",

This study elucidated the putative neuroprotective roles of vitamin B complex in MD-induced behavioural and neurochemical modifications in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of Wistar rats. Rat pups were maternally deprived on postnatal day 9 for 24 hours and then treated with or without vitamin B complex for 15 days while a control group was undisturbed during the experimental period. The rats were then subjected to behavioural paradigms to measure memory indices and anxiety levels. The rats were sacrificed to obtain the PFC and hippocampus for histomorphological and biochemical analysis. Behavioural analysis of the animals revealed that MD induced a declination in long- and short-term memory in addition to anxiety-like behaviour in the open field test. Cortico-hippocampal histomorphology of these animals showed an increased astrocytic density and chromatolysis, which were accompanied by reduced levels of superoxide dismutase and catalase enzymes. Vitamin B complex mitigated MD-induced behavioural decline, histomorphological perturbation and oxidative stress by enhancing the intrinsic antioxidant defence, thereby culminating in nootropic behaviour and reduced anxiety. In conclusion, we confirmed the hypothesis that vitamin B complex is neuroprotective against neuropathological alterations induced by maternal deprivation.",

    "abstract": "Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis is a mutually beneficial association of plants and fungi of the sub-phylum Glomeromycotina. The endosymbiotic AM fungi colonize the inner cortical cells of the roots, where they form branched hyphae called arbuscules that function in nutrient exchange with the plant. To support arbuscule development and subsequently bidirectional nutrient exchange, the root cortical cells undergo substantial transcriptional re-programming. REDUCED ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZA 1 (RAM1), studied in several dicot plant species, is a major regulator of this cortical cell transcriptional program. Here, we generated ram1 mutants and RAM1 overexpressors in a monocot, Brachypodium distachyon. The AM phenotypes of two ram1 lines revealed that RAM1 is only partly required to enable arbuscule development in B. distachyon. Transgenic lines constitutively overexpressing BdRAM1 showed constitutive expression of AM-inducible genes even in the shoots. Following inoculation with AM fungi, BdRAM1-overexpressing roots showed higher arbuscule densities relative to controls, indicating the potential to manipulate the relative proportion of symbiotic interfaces via modulation of RAM1. However, the overexpressors also show altered expression of hormone biosynthesis genes and aberrant growth patterns including stunted bushy shoots and poor seed set. While these phenotypes possibly provide additional clues about BdRAM1s scope of influence, they also indicate that directed approaches to increase the density of symbiotic interfaces will require a more focused, potentially cell-type specific manipulation of transcription factor gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Pain protects the body. However, pain can also occur for longer periods without serving protective functions. Such chronic pain conditions are difficult to treat. Thus, a better understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms and new approaches for the treatment of pain are urgently needed. Here, we investigated a causal role of oscillatory brain activity for pain and explored the potential of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) as a new treatment approach for pain. To this end, we investigated whether tACS can modulate pain and pain-related autonomic activity in 29 healthy human participants using a tonic heat pain paradigm as an experimental model of chronic pain. In 6 recording sessions, participants received tACS over prefrontal or somatosensory cortices at alpha or gamma frequencies or sham tACS. During tACS, pain ratings and autonomic responses were collected. TACS did not modulate pain intensity, the stability of pain ratings or the translation of the noxious stimulus into pain. Likewise, tACS did not change autonomic responses. Bayesian statistics further indicated a lack of tACS effects in most conditions. The only exception was alpha tACS over somatosensory cortex where evidence for tACS effects was inconclusive. Taken together, the present study did not find significant tACS effects on tonic experimental pain in healthy human participants. However, considering the conceptual plausibility of using tACS to modulate pain and the urgent need for novel pain treatments, further tACS studies are warranted. Based on the present findings, such studies might apply refined stimulation protocols targeting alpha oscillations in somatosensory cortices.",

    "abstract": "Motivation Identification of system-wide causal relationships can contribute to our understanding of long-distance, intercellular signaling in biological organisms. Dynamic transcriptome analysis holds great potential to uncover coordinated biological processes between organs. However, many existing dynamic transcriptome studies are characterized by sparse and often unevenly spaced time points that make the identification of causal relationships across organs analytically challenging. Application of existing statistical models, designed for regular time series with abundant time points, to sparse data may fail to reveal biologically significant, causal relationships. With increasing research interest in biological time series data, there is a need for new statistical methods that are able to determine causality within and between time series data sets. Here, a statistical framework was developed to identify (Granger) causal gene-gene relationships of unevenly spaced, multivariate time series data from two different tissues of Arabidopsis thaliana in response to a nitrogen signal.Results This work delivers a statistical approach for modelling irregularly sampled bivariate signals which embeds functions from the domain of engineering that allow to adapt the model\u2019s dependence structure to the specific sampling time. Using Maximum-Likelihood to estimate the parameters of this model for each bivariate time series, it is then possible to use bootstrap procedures for small samples (or asymptotics for large samples) in order to test for Granger-Causality. When applied to the Arabidopsis thaliana data, the proposed approach produced 3,078 significant interactions, in which 2,012 interactions have root causal genes and 1,066 interactions have shoot causal genes. Many of the predicted causal and target genes are known players in local and long-distance nitrogen signaling, including genes encoding transcription factors, hormones, and signaling peptides. Of the 1,007 total causal genes (either organ), 384 are either known or predicted mobile transcripts, suggesting that the identified causal genes may be directly involved in long-distance nitrogen signaling through intercellular interactions. The model predictions and subsequent network analysis identified nitrogen-responsive genes that can be further tested for their specific roles in long-distance nitrogen signaling.Availability The method was developed with the R statistical software and is made available thorugh the R package \u201cirg\u201d hosted on the GitHub repository https://github.com/SMAC-Group/irg.

    "abstract": "The hippocampuss dorsal and ventral parts are involved in different operative circuits, which functions vary in time during the night and day cycle. These functions are altered in epilepsy. Since energy production is tailored to function, we hypothesized that energy production would be space- and time-dependent in the hippocampus and that such organizing principle would be modified in epilepsy. Using metabolic imaging and metabolite sensing ex vivo, we show that the ventral hippocampus favors aerobic glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation as compared to the dorsal part in the morning in control mice. In the afternoon, aerobic glycolysis is decreased, and oxidative phosphorylation increased. In the dorsal hippocampus, the metabolic activity varies less between these two times but is weaker than in the ventral. Thus, the energy metabolism is different along the dorsoventral axis and changes as a function of time in control mice. In an experimental model of epilepsy, we find a large alteration of such spatio-temporal organization. In addition to a general hypometabolic state, the dorsoventral difference disappears in the morning, when seizure probability is low. In the afternoon, when seizure probability is high, the aerobic glycolysis is enhanced in both parts, the increase being stronger in the ventral area. We suggest that energy metabolism is tailored to the functions performed by brain networks, which vary over time. In pathological conditions, the alterations of these general rules may contribute to network dysfunctions.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe dorsal part of the hippocampus is involved in spatial learning and memory processes, while the ventral is implicated in motivational and emotional behavior. These functions change during the night and day cycle, and they are altered in epilepsy. Here we show that energy production (glycolysis versus oxidative phosphorylation) varies along the dorsoventral axis in a circadian manner ex vivo in control mice. These rules are altered in experimental epilepsy. Thus, energy production may be tailored to the function performed by hippocampal subdivisions and to the time of the day. Alterations in epilepsy may contribute to seizure generation and cognitive deficits.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEstrogen increases dramatically during pregnancy, but quickly drops below pre-pregnancy levels at birth and remains suppressed during the postpartum period. Clinical and rodent work suggests that this postpartum drop in estrogen results in an \"estrogen withdrawal\" state that is related to changes in affect, mood, and behavior. Most studies examining the effect of estrogen withdrawal on the brain have focused solely on the hippocampus.\n\nMethodsWe used a hormone-simulated pseudopregnancy model in Syrian hamsters, a first for this species. Ovariectomized females were given daily injections to approximate hormone levels during gestation and then withdrawn from estrogen to simulate postpartum estrogen withdrawal. Subjects were tested for behavioral assays of anxiety and anhedonia during estrogen withdrawal. Following sacrifice, neuroplasticity in oxytocin-producing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) and its efferent targets was measured.\n\nResultsEstrogen-withdrawn females had increased anxiety-like behaviors in the elevated plus and open field, but did not differ from controls in sucrose preference. Furthermore, estrogen-withdrawn females had more oxytocin-immunoreactive cells and oxytocin mRNA in the PVH, as well as an increase in oxytocin receptor density in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). Finally, blocking oxytocin receptors in the DRN during estrogen withdrawal prevented the high-anxiety behavioral phenotype in estrogen-withdrawn females.\n\nConclusionsEstrogen withdrawal alters oxytocin signaling in the PVH and DRN to increase anxiety-like behavior during the postpartum period. More broadly, these experiments suggest Syrian hamsters as a novel organism in which to model the effects of postpartum estrogen withdrawal on the brain and anxiety-like behavior.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we have created an 8-command P300 tactile BCI with two stimuli types, running on a minimally modified consumer Braille display and tested it on 10 blind subjects and 10 sighted controls. Blind subjects have demonstrated 27% higher median accuracy than sighted controls (p < 0.05), proving that the blind subjects are not only able to use tactile BCI but also can achieve superior results in comparison with sighted subjects. Median accuracy in the blind group with the best stimuli type has reached 95%. The difference in event-related potentials between groups is located in frontocentral sites before 300 ms post-stimulus and corresponds with early cognitive ERP components. The blind subjects have higher amplitude and lower latency of ERPs. This result is consistent through experimental conditions with different tactile stimuli. The classification performance for the blind subjects is correlated with Braille reading speed. This enables a discussion about mechanisms of plastic changes during sensory compensation after vision loss and its dependence on personal perceptual experience.\n\nAuthor summarySensory compensation following vision loss can be recognized as a unique model for neural plasticity. However, the magnitude of the effect and the specific tasks where its manifested is still a subject for debate. In this study, we have created a tactile brain-computer interface game to study how somatosensory processing is different between the blind and the sighted people. The participants were required to attend to tactile stimuli, and the correct stimulus was selected using realtime EEG classification. We have shown, for the first time, that the blind subjects are significantly better than the sighted in tactile brain-computer interface tasks. We have also found, that individual performance is correlated with Braille proficiency. This result links personal perceptual abilities in two different sensory tasks. EEG analysis revealed that differences in performance can be attributed to early cognitive processing steps. Along with practical considerations in brain-computer interface development, the results also add to the data on cognitive processing in the blind and enable the discussion on the importance of Braille education.",

Understanding the mechanisms that regulate the Glioblastoma invasion front is a major challenge with preeminent potential clinical relevance.

Right ventricular tissue was studied for cardiac fibrosis markers using RT-PCR and Western Blot analyses. Downstream effects were studied, for both RASSF-1 expression and methylation and its relation to ERK1/2, using in-vivo & in-vitro models\n\nResultsThere were significant increases in markers of cardiac fibrosis : Collagen 1, Alpha Smooth Muscle Actin (ASMA) and SNAIL, in the WT hypoxic animals as compared to the TG hypoxic group (p< 0.05). Expression of DNA methylation enzymes (DNMT 1,2) was significantly increased in the WT hypoxic mice as compared to the hypoxic TG mice (p<0.001). RASSF1A expression was significantly lower and ERK1/2 was significantly higher in hypoxia WT compared to the hypoxic TG group (p<0.05). Use of SiRNA to block RASSF1A gene expression in murine cardiac fibroblast tissue culture led to increased fibroblast proliferation (p<0.05). Methylation of RASSF1A promoter region showed a significant reduction in the TG hypoxic group compared to the WT hypoxic group (0.59 vs 0.75 respectively).\n\nConclusionsEC-SOD significantly attenuates RASSF1A gene methylation, and plays a pivotal role cardiac fibrosis induced by hypoxia.",

Previous models proposed dynein-based organelle transport generates length-dependent forces on astral MTs that pull centrosomes through the cytoplasm, away from the midplane. In Xenopus egg extracts, we co-imaged MTs, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, acidic organelles, F-actin, keratin, and fluorescein in moving and stationary asters. In asters that were moving in response to dynein and actomyosin forces, we observed that all cytoplasmic components moved together, i.e., as a continuum. Dynein-mediated organelle transport was restricted by interior MTs and F-actin. Organelles exhibited a burst of dynein-dependent inward movement at the growing aster surface, then mostly halted inside the aster. Dynein-coated beads were slowed by F-actin, but in contrast to organelles, beads did not halt inside asters. These observations call for new models of aster positioning based on surface forces and internal stresses.",

    "abstract": "Transdermal drug delivery is a key technology for administering drugs. However, most devices are \"one-size-fits-all\", even though drug diffusion through the skin varies significantly from person-to-person. For next-generation devices, personalization for optimal drug release would benefit from an augmented insight into the drug release and percutaneous uptake kinetics. Our objective was to quantify the changes in transdermal fentanyl uptake with regards to the patients age and the anatomical location where the patch was placed. We also explored to which extent the drug flux from the patch could be altered by miniaturizing the contact surface area of the patch reservoir with the skin. To this end, we used validated mechanistic modeling of fentanyl diffusion, storage, and partitioning in the epidermis to quantify drug release from the patch and the uptake within the skin. A superior spatiotemporal resolution compared to experimental methods enabled in-silico identification of peak concentrations and fluxes, and the amount of stored drug and bioavailability. The patients drug uptake showed a 36% difference between different anatomical locations after 72 h, but there was a strong interpatient variability. With aging, the drug uptake from the transdermal patch became slower and less potent. A 70-year-old patient received 26% less drug over the 72-h application period, compared to an 18-year-old patient. Additionally, a novel concept of using micron-sized drug reservoirs was explored in silico. These reservoirs induced a much higher local flux ({micro}g cm-2 h-1) than conventional patches. Up to a 200-fold increase in the drug flux was obtained from these small reservoirs. This effect was mainly caused by transverse diffusion in the stratum corneum, which is not relevant for much larger conventional patches. These micron-sized drug reservoirs open new ways to individualize reservoir design and thus transdermal therapy. Such computer-aided engineering tools also have great potential for in-silico design and precise control of drug delivery systems. Here, the validated mechanistic models can serve as a key building block for developing digital twins for transdermal drug delivery systems.",

We also demonstrate that the heme B prosthetic group present at the subunit dimer interface influences the stability and pressure lability of the cage, despite its location being discrete from the inter-dimer interface that is key to cage assembly.

    "abstract": "Prenatal ethanol exposure causes a variety of cognitive deficits that have a persistent impact on quality of life, some of which may be explained by ethanol-induced alterations in interneuron function. Studies from several laboratories, including our own, have demonstrated that a single binge-like ethanol exposure during the equivalent to the third trimester of human pregnancy leads to acute apoptosis and long-term loss of interneurons in the rodent retrosplenial cortex (RSC). The RSC is interconnected with the hippocampus, thalamus, and other neocortical regions and plays distinct roles in visuospatial processing and storage, as well as retrieval of hippocampal-dependent episodic memories. Here we used slice electrophysiology to characterize the acute effects of ethanol on GABAergic neurotransmission in the RSC of neonatal mice, as well as the long-term effects of neonatal ethanol exposure on parvalbumin-interneuron mediated neurotransmission in adolescent mice. Mice were exposed to ethanol using vapor inhalation chambers. In postnatal day (P) 7 mouse pups, ethanol unexpectedly failed to potentiate GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission. Binge-like ethanol exposure of P7 mice expressing channel rhodopsin in parvalbumin-positive interneurons enhanced the peak amplitudes, asynchronous activity and total charge, while decreasing the rise-times of optically-evoked GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents in adolescent animals. These effects could partially explain the learning and memory deficits that have been documented in adolescent and young adult mice exposed to ethanol during the third trimester-equivalent developmental period.",

To simplify testing and reduce the volume of required reagents, we developed a multiplex RT-qPCR assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 in a single reaction. We used existing N1, N2, and RP primer and probe sets by the CDC, but substituted fluorophores to allow multiplexing of the assay. The cycle threshold (Ct) values of our multiplex RT-qPCR were comparable to those obtained by the singleplex assay adapted for research purposes. Low copies (>500 copies / reaction) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were consistently detected by the multiplex RT-qPCR. Our novel multiplex RT-qPCR improves upon current singleplex diagnostics by saving reagents, costs, time and labor.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiological cause of the coronavirus disease 2019, for which no effective therapeutics are available. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) is essential for viral replication and constitutes a promising therapeutic target. Many efforts aimed at deriving effective Mpro inhibitors are currently underway, including an international open-science discovery project, codenamed COVID Moonshot. As part of COVID Moonshot, we used saturation transfer difference nuclear magnetic resonance (STD-NMR) spectroscopy to assess the binding of putative Mpro ligands to the viral protease, including molecules identified by crystallographic fragment screening and novel compounds designed as Mpro inhibitors. In this manner, we aimed to complement enzymatic activity assays of Mpro performed by other groups with information on ligand affinity. We have made the Mpro STD-NMR data publicly available. Here, we provide detailed information on the NMR protocols used and challenges faced, thereby placing these data into context. Our goal is to assist the interpretation of Mpro STD-NMR data, thereby accelerating ongoing drug design efforts.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and anti-calcification effects of Entelon150(R) (consisting of grape-seed extract) in a beagle dog model of intravascular bovine pericardium implantation.\n\nMethodsIn total, 8 healthy male beagle dogs were implanted with a bovine pericardium bilaterally in the external jugular veins and divided into two groups. Animals in the Entelon150(R) group (n = 4) were treated with 150 mg of Entelon150(R) twice daily for six weeks after surgery. The negative control (NC) group (n = 4) was treated with 5 ml of saline using the same method. After six weeks, we measured the calcium content, performed histological examination, and performed molecular analysis.\n\nResultsThe calcium content of implanted tissue in the Entelon150(R) group (0.56{+/-}0.14 mg/g) was significantly lower than that in the NC group (1.48{+/-}0.57 mg/g) (p < 0.05). Histopathological examination showed that infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells, such as fibroblasts and macrophages, occurred around the graft in all groups; however, the inflammation level of the implanted tissue in the Entelon150(R) group was significantly lower than that in the NC group. Both immunohistochemical and western blot analyses revealed that bone morphogenetic protein 2 expression was significantly attenuated in the Entelon150(R) group.\n\nConclusionsOur results indicate that Entelon150(R) significantly attenuates post-implantation inflammation and degenerative calcification of the bovine pericardium in dogs. Therefore, Entelon150(R) may increase the longevity of the bovine pericardium after intravascular implantation.",

    "abstract": "Scorpions have arguably the most elaborate \u201ctongues\u201d on the planet: two paired ventral combs, called pectines, that are covered in thousands of chemo-tactile peg sensilla and that sweep the ground as the animal walks. Males use their pectines to detect female pheromones during the mating season, but females have pectines too: What additional purpose must the pectines serve? Why are there so many pegs? We take a computational approach to test the hypothesis that scorpions use their pectines to navigate by chemo-textural familiarity in a manner analogous to the visual navigation-by-scene-familiarity hypothesis for hymenopteran insects. We have developed a general model of navigation by familiarity with a local sensor and have chosen a range of plausible parameters for it based on the existing behavioral, physiological, morphological, and neurological understanding of the pectines. Similarly, we constructed virtual environments based on the scorpion\u2019s native sand habitat. Using a novel methodology of highly parallel high-throughput simulations, we comprehensively tested 2160 combinations of sensory and environmental properties in each of 24 different situations, giving a total of 51,840 trials. Our results show that navigation by familiarity with a local pectine-like sensor is feasible. Further, they suggest a subtle interplay between \u201ccomplexity\u201d and \u201ccontinuity\u201d in navigation by familiarity and give the surprising result that more complexity \u2014 more detail and more information \u2014 is not always better for navigational performance.Author summary Scorpions\u2019 pectines are intricate taste-and-touch sensory appendages that brush the ground as the animal walks. Pectines are involved in detecting pheromones, but their exquisite complexity \u2014 a pair of pectines can have around 100,000 sensory neurons \u2014 suggests that they do more. One hypothesis is \u201cNavigation by Scene Familiarity,\u201d which explains how bees and ants use their compound eyes to navigate home: the insect visually scans side to side as it moves, compares what it sees to scenes learned along a training path, and moves in the direction that looks most familiar. We propose that the scorpions\u2019 pectines can be used to navigate similarly: instead of looking around, they sweep side to side sensing local chemical and textural information. We crafted simulated scorpions based on current understanding of the pectines and tested their navigational performance in virtual versions of the animals\u2019 sandy habitat. Using a supercomputer, we varied nine environmental, sensory, and situational properties and ran a total of 51,840 trials of simulated navigation. We showed that navigation by familiarity with a local sensor like the pectines is feasible. Surprisingly, we also found that having a more detailed landscape and/or a more sensitive sensor is not always optimal.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (MSR1) plays an important role in host defense to bacterial infections, M2 macrophage polarization and lipid homeostasis. However, its physiological function in viral pathogenesis remains poorly defined. Herein, we report that MSR1 facilitates vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection in the spinal cord. Msr1-deficient (Msr1-/-) mice presented reduced morbidity and mortality following lethal VSV infection, along with normal viremia and antiviral innate immune responses, compared to Msr1+/- littermates and wild-type mice. Msr1 expression was selectively upregulated in the spinal cord, which was the predominant target of VSV infection. The viral load in the spinal cord was positively correlated with Msr1 expression level and was reduced in Msr1-/- mice. Through its extracellular domain, MSR1 interacted with VSV surface glycoprotein and facilitated its cellular entry. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that MSR1 serves as a cellular entry receptor for VSV and facilitates its infection specifically in the spinal cord.",

It transitions from closed to open conformations to expose its receptor binding site, and subsequently from prefusion to postfusion conformations to mediate fusion of viral and cellular membranes. S protein derivatives are components of vaccine candidates and diagnostic assays, as well as tools for research into the biology and immunology of SARS-CoV-2. Here we have designed mutations in S which allow production of thermostable, crosslinked, S protein trimers that are trapped in the closed, pre-fusion, state. We have determined the structures of crosslinked and non-crosslinked proteins, identifying two distinct closed conformations of the S trimer. We demonstrate that the designed, thermostable, closed S trimer can be used in serological assays. This protein has potential applications as a reagent for serology, virology and as an immunogen.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the two primary experimental means of characterizing macromolecular structures, including protein structures. Structure determination by NMR spectroscopy has traditionally relied heavily on distance restraints derived from nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) measurements. While structure determination of proteins from NOE-based restraints is well understood and broadly used, structure determination by NOEs imposes increasing quantity of data for analysis, increased cost of structure determination and is less available in the study of perdeuterated proteins. In the recent decade, Residual Dipolar Couplings (RDCs) have been investigated as an alternative source of data for structural elucidation of proteins by NMR. Several methods have been reported that utilize RDCs in addition to NOEs, and a few utilize RDC data alone. While these methods have individually demonstrated some successes, none of these methods have exposed the full potential of protein structure determination from RDCs. To date, structure determination of proteins from RDCs is limited to small proteins (less than 8.5 kDa) using RDC data from many alignment media (>3) that cannot be collected from larger proteins. Here we present the latest version of the REDCRAFT software package designed for structure determination of proteins from RDC data alone. We have demonstrated the success of REDCRAFT in structure determination of proteins ranging in size from 50 to 145 residues using experimentally collected data and large proteins (145 to 573 residues) using simulated RDC data that can be collected from perdeuterated proteins. Finally, we demonstrate the accuracy of structure determination of REDCRAFT from RDCs alone in application to the structurally novel PF.2048 protein. The RDC-based structure of PF.2048 exhibited 1.0 [A] of BB-RMSD with respect to the NOE-based structure by only using a small amount of backbone RDCs ([~]3 restraints per residue) compared to what is required by other approaches.\n\nAuthor SummaryResidual Dipolar Couplings have the potential to reduce the cost and the time needed to characterize protein structures. In addition, RDC data have been demonstrated to concurrently elucidate structure of proteins, perform assignment of resonances, and be used in characterization of the internal dynamics of proteins. Given all the advantages associated with the study of proteins from RDC data, based on the statistics provided by the Protein Databank (PDB), surprisingly the only 124 proteins (out of nearly 150,000 proteins) have utilized RDCs as part of their structure determination. Even a smaller subset of these proteins (approximately 7) have utilized RDCs as the primary source of data for structure determination. The impeding factor in the use of RDCs is the challenging computational and analytical aspects of this source of data. In this report, we demonstrate the success of the REDCRAFT software package in structure determination of proteins using RDC data that can be collected from small and large proteins in a routine fashion. REDCRAFT accomplishes the challenging task of structure determination from RDCs by introducing a unique search and optimization technique that is both robust and computationally tractable. Structure determination from routinely collectable RDC data using REDCRAFT can lead to faster and cheaper study of larger and more complex proteins by NMR spectroscopy in solution state.",

We additionally discovered novel pro-viral genes and pathways including the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex and key components of the TGF-{beta} signaling pathway. Small molecule inhibitors of these pathways prevented SARS-CoV-2-induced cell death. We also revealed that the alarmin HMGB1 is critical for SARS-CoV-2 replication.

Here we report the crystal structure of main protease of SARS-CoV-2 bound to a previously identified Chinese herb inhibitor shikonin at 2.45 angstrom resolution. Although the structure revealed here shares similar overall structure with other published structures, there are several key differences which highlight potential features that could be exploited. The catalytic dyad His41-Cys145 undergoes dramatic conformational changes, and the structure reveals an unusual arrangement of oxyanion loop stabilized by the substrate. Binding to shikonin and binding of covalent inhibitors show different binding modes, suggesting a diversity in inhibitor binding. As we learn more about different binding modes and their structure-function relationships, it is probable that we can design more effective and specific drugs with high potency that can serve as effect SARS-CoV-2 anti-viral agents.",

Hence, buried \"unsatisfied\" polar groups making no hydrogen bonds are very rare in proteins. Efficiently representing the energetic cost of unsatisfied hydrogen bonds with a pairwise-decomposable energy term during protein design is challenging since whether or not a group is satisfied depends on all of its neighbors. Here we describe a method for assigning a pairwise-decomposable energy to sidechain rotamers such that following combinatorial sidechain packing, buried unsaturated polar atoms are penalized. The penalty can be any quadratic function of the number of unsatisfied polar groups, and can be computed very rapidly. We show that inclusion of this term in Rosetta sidechain packing calculations substantially reduces the number of buried unsatisfied polar groups.",

By testing nearly 600 serum samples, pGOLD COVID-19 assay achieved ~ 99.78 % specificity for detecting both IgG and IgM with 100 % sensitivity in sera collected > 14 days post disease symptom onset, with zero cross-reactivity to other diseases. Two-plex correlation analysis revealed higher binding of serum IgM to RBD than to S1. IgG antibody avidity toward multiple antigens were measured, shedding light on antibody maturation in COVID-19 patients and affording a powerful tool for differentiating recent from remote infections and identifying re-infection by SARS-CoV-2.

    "abstract": "The ultimate outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown and is dependent on a complex interplay of its pathogenicity, transmissibility and population immunity. In the current study, SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was investigated for the presence of large scale internal RNA base pairing in its genome. This property, termed genome scale ordered RNA structure (GORS) has been previously associated with host persistence in other positive-strand RNA viruses, potentially through its shielding effect on viral RNA recognition in the cell. Genomes of SARS-CoV-2 were remarkably structured, with minimum folding energy differences (MFEDs) of 15%, substantially greater than previously examined viruses such as HCV (MFED 7-9%). High MFED values were shared with all coronavirus genomes analysed created by several hundred consecutive energetically favoured stem-loops throughout the genome. In contrast to replication-association RNA structure, GORS was poorly conserved in the positions and identities of base pairing with other sarbecoviruses - even similarly positioned stem-loops in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV rarely shared homologous pairings, indicative of more rapid evolutionary change in RNA structure than in the underlying coding sequences. Sites predicted to be base-paired in SARS-CoV-2 showed substantially less sequence diversity than unpaired sites, suggesting that disruption of RNA structure by mutation imposes a fitness cost on the virus which is potentially restrictive to its longer evolution. Although functionally uncharacterised, GORS in SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses represent important elements in their cellular interactions that may contribute to their persistence and transmissibility.",

    "abstract": "HIV rapidly infects the central nervous system (CNS) and establishes a persistent viral reservoir within microglia, perivascular macrophages and astrocytes. Inefficient control of CNS viral replication by antiretroviral therapy results in chronic inflammation and progressive cognitive decline in up to 50% of infected individuals with no effective treatment options. Neurotrophin based therapies have excellent potential to stabilize and repair the nervous system. A novel non-peptide ligand, LM11A-31, that targets the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) has been identified as a small bioavailable molecule capable of strong neuroprotection with minimal side effects. To evaluate the neuroprotective effects of LM11A-31 in a natural infection model, we treated cats chronically infected with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) with 13 mg/kg LM11A-31 twice daily over a period of 10 weeks and assessed effects on cognitive functions, open field behaviors, activity, sensory thresholds, plasma FIV, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FIV, peripheral blood mononuclear cell provirus, CD4 and CD8 cell counts and general physiology. Between 12 and 18 months post-inoculation, cats began to show signs of neural dysfunction in T maze testing and novel object recognition, which were prevented by LM11A-31 treatment. Anxiety-like behavior was reduced in the open field and no changes were seen in sensory thresholds. Systemic FIV titers were unaffected but treated cats exhibited a log drop in CSF FIV titers. No significant adverse effects were observed under all conditions. The data indicate that LM11A-31 is likely to be a potent adjunctive treatment for the control of neurodegeneration in HIV infected individuals.\n\nAuthor SummaryThere are no effective treatments to halt the progression of most neurodegenerative diseases including HIV-associated neurodegeneration. Neurotrophins have the potential to provide strong neuroprotection but it has been difficult to develop usable interventions. A new drug, LM11A-31, that targets the p75 neurotrophin receptor has been developed that provides potent neuroprotection, is orally bioavailable and has the potential to prevent disease progression. The current studies were designed to evaluate the effects of the compound in an animal model of active HIV infection in preparation for a human clinical trial. Treatment of chronically infected animals with LM11A-31 normalized deficits in T maze performance, novel object recognition and open field behavior with no measurable adverse effects. Potential adverse effects associated with natural neurotrophins such as changes in sensory perception and increased systemic viral burden were not observed. A decrease in CSF FIV titers and a slight improvement in the CD4:CD8 ratio suggested that LM11A-31 may have beneficial effects beyond the anticipated neuroprotective effects. These findings are similar to beneficial effects seen in other animal models of neurodegeneration and CNS injury and support the use of LM11A-31 as an adjunctive neuroprotective agent for the treatment of HIV infected individuals.",

    "abstract": "The global emergence of SARS-CoV-2 urgently requires an in-depth understanding of molecular functions of viral proteins and their interactions with the host proteome. Several individual omics studies have extended our knowledge of COVID-19 pathophysiology1-10. Integration of such datasets to obtain a holistic view of virus-host interactions and to define the pathogenic properties of SARS-CoV-2 is limited by the heterogeneity of the experimental systems. We therefore conducted a concurrent multi-omics study of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Using state-of-the-art proteomics, we profiled the interactome of both viruses, as well as their influence on transcriptome, proteome, ubiquitinome and phosphoproteome in a lung-derived human cell line. Projecting these data onto the global network of cellular interactions revealed crosstalk between the perturbations taking place upon SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infections at different layers and identified unique and common molecular mechanisms of these closely related coronaviruses. The TGF-{beta} pathway, known for its involvement in tissue fibrosis, was specifically dysregulated by SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 and autophagy by SARS-CoV-2 ORF3. The extensive dataset (available at https://covinet.innatelab.org) highlights many hotspots that can be targeted by existing drugs and it can guide rational design of virus- and host-directed therapies, which we exemplify by identifying kinase and MMPs inhibitors with potent antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Barbara McClintock first hypothesized that interspecific hybridization could provide a \"genomic shock\" that leads to the mobilization of transposable elements. This hypothesis is based on the idea that regulation of transposable element movement is potentially disrupted in hybrids. However, the handful of studies testing this hypothesis have yielded mixed results. Here, we set out to identify if hybridization can increase transposition rate and facilitate colonization of transposable elements in Saccharomyces cerevisiae x Saccharomyces uvarum interspecific yeast hybrids. S. cerevisiae have a small number of active long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons (Ty elements), while their distant relative S. uvarum have lost the Ty elements active in S. cerevisiae. While the regulation system of Ty elements is known in S. cerevisiae, it is unclear how Ty elements are regulated in other Saccharomyces species, and what mechanisms contributed to the loss of most classes of Ty elements in S. uvarum. Therefore, we first assessed whether transposable elements could insert in the S. uvarum sub-genome of a S. cerevisiae x S. uvarum hybrid. We induced transposition to occur in these hybrids and developed a sequencing technique to show that Ty elements insert readily and non-randomly in the S. uvarum genome. We then used an in vivo reporter construct to directly measure transposition rate in hybrids, demonstrating that hybridization itself does not alter rate of mobilization. However, we surprisingly show that species-specific mitochondrial inheritance can change transposition rate by an order of magnitude. Overall, our results provide evidence that hybridization can facilitate the introduction of transposable elements across species boundaries and alter transposition via mitochondrial transmission, but that this does not lead to unrestrained proliferation of transposable elements suggested by the genomic shock theory.",

    "abstract": "Light, circadian clocks, and rhythmic behaviors interact closely to produce a temporal order that is essential for the survival of most living organisms. In mammals, the principal circadian pacemaker in the brain is the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which receives direct retinal input and synchronizes itself and other brain regions to the external light-dark cycle. Altered day length (photoperiod) and disrupted circadian rhythms are associated with impaired memory and mood in both humans and animal models. Prior work demonstrated that altering photoperiod can change neurotransmitter (NT) expression in the periventricular nucleus (PeVN) of the hypothalamus in adult rat brain. Here we show that neuromedin S-(NMS-) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-(VIP-) expressing neurons in the SCN also display photoperiod-induced neurotransmitter switching. Such photoperiod-dependent NT plasticity is retained in Bmal1-KO mice, indicating that NT plasticity in the SCN does not require a functional circadian clock. Utilizing a conditional viral DO-DIO vector as an historical marker of NT expression in the SCN, we further reveal that short-day photoperiod induces a cluster of non-NMS-expressing neurons to undergo NT switching and acquire the NMS phenotype. Selective chemogenetic activation of NMS neurons, but not VIP neurons, during the dark phase induces a significant delay in the timing of locomotor activity onset and is sufficient to increase the number of dopaminergic neurons in the PeVN. Our findings provide novel insights into molecular adaptations of the SCN neuronal network in response to altered photoperiod that affect neuronal circuit function in the hypothalamus and lead to changes in circadian behavior.",

    "abstract": "Androgen receptor (AR) signaling is the central driver of prostate cancer across disease states. While androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is effective in the initial treatment of prostate cancer, resistance to ADT or to next-generation androgen pathway inhibitors invariably arises, most commonly through re-activation of the AR axis. Thus, orthogonal approaches to inhibit AR signaling in advanced prostate cancer are essential. Here, via genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 screening, we identify protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) as a critical mediator of AR expression and signaling. PRMT1 regulates recruitment of AR to genomic target sites and inhibition of PRMT1 impairs AR binding at lineage-specific enhancers, leading to decreased expression of key oncogenes, including AR itself. Additionally, AR-driven prostate cancer cells are uniquely susceptible to combined AR and PRMT1 inhibition. Our findings implicate PRMT1 as a key regulator of AR output and provide a preclinical framework for co-targeting of AR and PRMT1 in advanced prostate cancer.",

    "abstract": "Date fruits are endowed with medicinal values, including boosting the male fertility status, but with meagre empirical evidence. Thus, the current study was designed to assess the ameliorative and potential adverse effects of date fruit extracts (Phoenix dactylifera) on cypermethrin-induced male infertility. The study was conducted in two phases using adult male Wistar rats (n = 42, 180 \u2013 220 g and aged 14 - 16 weeks). The first phase was a single oral dose toxicity study to ascertain the suitability of date fruit extract and cypermethrin administered at 250 mg/kg and 60 mg/kg, respectively. The second phase, which included four treatment groups of six animals per group, assessed the effects of date fruits on cypermethrin-induced infertility. At the termination of the experiment, semen was collected by epididymal extraction for the assessment of sperm abnormalities, motility, mass activity, semen pH, and percentage live. Serum samples were also collected for testosterone and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) profiling, and the collected data was subjected to statistical analysis. The group administered only cypermethrin showed a decrease in percentage motility, live, mass activity and an increase in total abnormalities over the control group while the group exposed to only date fruits extracts showed increased percentage motility, live, mass activity and a decrease in total abnormalities over the control. The results of a combined administration of date fruit extracts and cypermethrin on a separate group showed a consistently reduced percentage of anatomically abnormal sperm cells and a general improvement of sperm motility and mass activity. There was no significant difference in the weight of the Wister rats in all the groups (p &gt; 0.05). However, testosterone and FSH levels were significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.05) by date fruit extract treatment. The current report provides evidence of the potential ameliorative effects of date fruit extracts in cypermethrin-induced male infertility and cautions excessive use or abuse since some adverse effects were observed.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The interaction between insects and the flowers they pollinate has driven the evolutionary diversity of both insects and flowering plants, two groups with the most numerous species on earth. Insects use vision and olfaction to localize their host plants, but to feed from the flower, they must find the tiny nectary opening, which can be well beyond their visual resolution. When vision is limited, the sense of touch becomes especially crucial, yet very few studies have investigated the role of rapid and precise tactile feedback in successful feeding and pollination interactions. In this paper, we study the remarkable feeding behavior of flying insects that use their proboscis, a flexible mouthpart often longer than their entire body length when unfurled, to expertly explore floral surfaces. Specifically, we observed how the crepuscular hawkmoth Manduca sexta interacts with artificial, 3D-printed flowers of varying shapes. We found that moths actively explore the flower for tactile features, systematically sweeping their proboscis from edge to center repeatedly until they locate the nectary. Moreover, naive moths rapidly learn to exploit flowers, and they adopt a tactile search strategy to more directly locate the nectary in as few as three to five consecutive visits. We suggest moths wield their proboscis to extract salient tactile features, such as floral edges and corolla curvature. Our results highlight the proboscis as a unique sensory structure and emphasize the central role of touch in insect-plant pollination interactions.",
