    "abstract": "Dynamic Functional Connectivity (dFC) in the resting state (rs) is considered as a correlate of cognitive processing. Describing dFC as a flow across morphing connectivity configurations, our notion of dFC speed quantifies the rate at which FC networks evolve in time. Here we probe the hypothesis that variations of rs dFC speed and cognitive performance are selectively interrelated within specific functional subnetworks.\n\nIn particular, we focus on Sleep Deprivation (SD) as a reversible model of cognitive dysfunction. We found that whole-brain level (global) dFC speed significantly slows down after 24h of SD. However, the reduction in global dFC speed does not correlate with variations of cognitive performance in individual tasks, which are subtle and highly heterogeneous. On the contrary, we found strong correlations between performance variations in individual tasks -including Rapid Visual Processing (RVP, assessing sustained visual attention)- and dFC speed quantified at the level of functional subnetworks of interest. Providing a compromise between classic static FC (no time) and global dFC (no space), modular dFC speed analyses allow quantifying a different speed of dFC reconfiguration independently for sub-networks overseeing different tasks. Importantly, we found that RVP performance robustly correlates with the modular dFC speed of a characteristic frontoparietal module.\n\nHighlightsO_LISleep Deprivation (SD) slows down the random walk in FC space implemented by Dynamic Functional Connectivity (dFC) at rest.\nC_LIO_LIWhole-brain level slowing of dFC speed does not selectively correlate with fine and taskspecific changes in performance\nC_LIO_LIWe quantify dFC speed separately for different link-based modules coordinated by distinct regional \"meta-hubs\"\nC_LIO_LIModular dFC speed variations capture subtle and task-specific variations of cognitive performance induced by SD.\nC_LI\n\nAuthor summaryWe interpreted dynamic Functional Connectivity (dFC) as a random walk in the space of possible FC networks performed with a quantifiable \"speed\".\n\nHere, we analyze a fMRI dataset in which subjects are scanned and cognitively tested both before and after Sleep Deprivation (SD), used as a reversible model of cognitive dysfunction. While global dFC speed slows down after a sleepless night, it is not a sufficiently sensitive metric to correlate with fine and specific cognitive performance changes. To boost the capacity of dFC speed analyses to account for fine and specific cognitive decline, we introduce the notion of modular dFC speed. Capitalizing on an edge-centric measure of functional connectivity, which we call Meta-Connectivity, we isolate subgraphs of FC describing relatively independent random walks (dFC modules) and controlled by distinct \"puppet masters\" (meta-hubs). We then find that variations of the random walk speed of distinct dFC modules now selectively correlate with SD-induced variations of performance in the different tasks. This is in agreement with the fact that different subsystems - distributed but functionally distinct- oversee different tasks.\n\nThe high sensitivity of modular dFC analyses bear promise of future applications to the early detection and longitudinal characterization of pathologies such as Alzheimers disease.",

    "abstract": "A gene regulatory network can be described at a high level by a directed graph with signed edges, and at a more detailed level by a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The former qualitatively models the causal regulatory interactions between ordered pairs of genes, while the latter quantitatively models the time-varying concentrations of mRNA and proteins. This paper clarifies the connection between the two types of models.\n\nWe propose a property, called the constant sign property, for a general class of ODE models. The constant sign property characterizes the set of conditions (system parameters, external signals, or internal states) under which an ODE model is consistent with a signed, directed graph. If the constant sign property for an ODE model holds globally for all conditions, then the ODE model has a single signed, directed graph. If the constant sign property for an ODE model only holds locally, which may be more typical, then the ODE model corresponds to different graphs under different sets of conditions. In addition, two versions of constant sign property are given and a relationship between them is proved.\n\nAs an example, the ODE models that capture the effect of cis-regulatory elements involving protein complex binding, based on the model in the GeneNetWeaver source code, are described in detail and shown to satisfy the global constant sign property with a unique consistent gene regulatory graph. Even a single gene regulatory graph is shown to have many ODE models of GeneNetWeaver type consistent with it due to combinatorial complexity and continuous parameters.\n\nFinally the question of how closely data generated by one ODE model can be fit by another ODE model is explored. It is observed that the fit is better if the two models come from the same graph.",

    "abstract": "Temporal patterns in communities have gained widespread attention recently, to the extent that temporal changes in community composition are now termed \"temporal beta-diversity\". Previous studies of beta-diversity have made use of two classes of dissimilarity indices: incidence-based (e.g., Sorensen and Jaccard dissimilarity) and abundance-based (e.g., Bray-Curtis and Ru[z]i[c]ka dissimilarity). However, in the context of temporal beta-diversity, the persistence of identical individuals and turnover among other individuals within the same species over time have not been considered, despite the fact that both will affect compositional changes in communities. To address this issue, I propose new index concepts for beta-diversity and the relative speed of compositional shifts in relation to individual turnover based on individual identity information. Individual-based beta-diversity indices are novel dissimilarity indices that consider individual identity information to quantitatively evaluate temporal change in individual turnover and community composition. I applied these new indices to individually tracked tree monitoring data in deciduous and evergreen broad-leaved forests across the Japanese archipelago with the objective of quantifying the effect of climate change trends (i.e., rates of change of both annual mean temperature and annual precipitation) on individual turnover and compositional shifts at each site. A new index explored the relative contributions of mortality and recruitment processes to temporal changes in community composition. Clear patterns emerged showing that an increase in the temperature change rate facilitated the relative contribution of mortality components. The relative speed of compositional shift increased with increasing temperature change rates in deciduous forests but decreased with increasing warming rates in evergreen forests. These new concepts provide a way to identify novel and high-resolution temporal patterns in communities.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that language processing is well-adapted to noise in the input (e.g., speech errors, mishearing) and readily corrects the input via rational inference over possible intended sentences and probable noise corruptions. However, it remains unclear whether this inference takes the form of an offline re-analysis or a rapid, real-time correction to the representations of the input. We hypothesize that noise inferences happen online during processing and that well-studied ERP components may serve as a useful index of this process. In particular, a reduced N400 effect and increased P600 effect appear to accompany sentences where the probability that the message was corrupted by noise exceeds the probability that it was produced intentionally and perceived accurately. Indeed, semantic violations that are attributable to noise--for example, in \"The storyteller could turn any incident into an amusing antidote\", where the implausible word \"antidote\" is orthographically and phonologically close to the intended \"anecdote\"--elicit a reduced N400 effect and larger P600 effect. Further, the magnitude of this P600 effect is shown to relate to the probability that the comprehender will retrieve a plausible alternative. This work thus adds to the growing body of literature that suggests that many aspects of language processing are well-adapted to noise in the input and opens the door to electrophysiologic investigations of these processes",

    "abstract": "Automatic monitoring of biodiversity by acoustic sensors has become an indispensable tool to assess environmental stress at an early stage. Due to the difficulty in recognizing the Amazons high acoustic diversity and the large amounts of raw audio data recorded by the sensors, the labeling and manual inspection of this data is not feasible.\n\nTherefore, we propose an ecoacoustic index that allows us to quantify the complexity of an audio segment and correlate this measure with the biodiversity of the soundscape. The approach uses unsupervised methods to avoid the problem of labeling each species individually. The proposed index, named the Ecoacoustic Global Complexity Index (EGCI), makes use of Entropy, Divergence and Statistical Complexity. A distinguishing feature of this index is the mapping of each audio segment, including those of varied lenghts, as a single point in a 2D-plane, supporting us in understanding the ecoacoustic dynamics of the rainforest. The main results show a regularity in the ecoacoustic richness of a floodplain, considering different temporal granularities, be it between hours of the day or between consecutive days of the monitoring program. We observed that this regularity does a good job of characterizing the soundscape of the environmental protection area of Mamiraua, in the Amazon, differentiating between species richness and environmental phenomena.",

Malaria-causing parasites have a life cycle with unique cell-division cycles, and a repertoire of divergent CDKs and cyclins of poorly understood function and interdependency. We show that Plasmodium berghei CDK-related kinase 5 (CRK5), is a critical regulator of atypical mitosis in the gametogony and is required for mosquito transmission. It phosphorylates canonical CDK motifs of components in the pre-replicative complex and is essential for DNA replication. During a replicative cycle, CRK5 stably interacts with a single Plasmodium-specific cyclin (SOC2), although we obtained no evidence of SOC2 cycling by transcription, translation or degradation. Our results provide evidence that during Plasmodium male gametogony, this divergent cyclin/CDK pair fills the functional space of other eukaryotic cell-cycle kinases controlling DNA replication.",

It remains unclear though, how complex genome alterations affect molecular networks through changing protein levels, and consequently biochemical states of tumor tissues.\n\nResultsHere, we investigated the propagation of genomic effects along the axis of gene expression during prostate cancer progression. For that, we quantified genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic alterations based on 105 prostate samples, consisting of benign prostatic hyperplasia regions and malignant tumors, from 39 prostate cancer patients. Our analysis revealed convergent effects of distinct copy number alterations impacting on common downstream proteins, which are important for establishing the tumor phenotype. We devised a network-based approach that integrates perturbations across different molecular layers, which identified a sub-network consisting of nine genes whose joint activity positively correlated with increasingly aggressive tumor phenotypes and was predictive of recurrence-free survival. Further, our data revealed a wide spectrum of intra-patient network effects, ranging from similar to very distinct alterations on different molecular layers.\n\nConclusionsThis study uncovered molecular networks with remarkably convergent alterations across tumor sites and patients, but it also exposed a diversity of network effects: we could not identify a single sub-network that was perturbed in all high-grade tumor regions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHnf4a is a major regulator of renal proximal tubule (PT) development. In humans, a mutation in HNF4A is associated with Fanconi renotubular syndrome (FRTS), which is caused by defective PT functions. In mice, mosaic deletion of Hnf4a in the developing kidney causes a paucity of PT cells, leading to FRTS-like symptoms. The molecular mechanisms underlying the role of Hnf4a in PT development remain unclear.\n\nMethodsWe generated a new Hnf4a mutant mouse model employing Osr2Cre, which effectively deletes Hnf4a in developing nephrons. We characterized the mutant phenotype by immunofluorescence analysis. We performed lineage analysis to test if Cdh6-expressing cells are PT progenitors. We also performed genome-wide mapping of Hnf4a binding sites and differential gene analysis of Hnf4a mutant kidneys to identify direct target genes of Hnf4a.\n\nResultsDeletion of Hnf4a with Osr2Cre led to the complete loss of mature PT cells, causing lethality in the Hnf4a mutant mice. We found that Cdh6high, LTLlow cells serve as PT progenitors and that they show higher proliferation than Cdh6low, LTLhigh differentiated PT cells. We also found that Hnf4a is required for PT progenitors to develop into differentiated PT cells. Our genomic analyses revealed that Hnf4a directly regulates the expression of genes involved in transmembrane transport and metabolism.\n\nConclusionsOur findings show that Hnf4a promotes the development of PT progenitors into differentiated PT cells by regulating the expression of genes associated with reabsorption, the major function of PT cells.\n\nSignificanceProximal tubule cells are the most abundant cell type in the mammalian kidney and they perform the bulk of the renal reabsorption function. Despite their importance in kidney function, the molecular mechanisms of proximal tubule development and maturation are not well understood. Here we find that, in the developing mouse kidney, Cdh6high, LTLlow cells act as proximal tubule progenitors and that Hnf4a is required for these cells to further develop into proximal tubules. Our genomic analyses show that Hnf4a directly regulate the expression of genes required for reabsorption such as transmembrane transport genes and metabolism genes. This study advances our understanding of how kidney proximal tubule cells form during development.",

    "abstract": "Sexually dimorphic traits in insects are rapidly evolving due to sexual selection which can ultimately lead to speciation. However, our knowledge of the underlying sex-specific molecular mechanisms is still scarce. Here we show that the highly conserved gene, Doublesex (Dsx), regulates rapidly diverging sexually dimorphic traits in the model parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae). We present here the revised full Dsx gene structure with an alternative first exon, and two additional male NvDsx isoforms, which gives important insights into the evolution of the sex-specific oligomerization domains and C-termini. We show the sex-specific NvDsx expression throughout development, and demonstrate that transient NvDsx silencing in different male developmental stages dramatically shifts the morphology of two sexually dimorphic traits from male to female, with the effect being dependent on the timing of silencing. In addition, transient silencing of NvDsx in early male larvae affects male genitalia tissue growth but not morphology. This indicates that male NvDsx is actively required to suppress female-specific traits and to promote male-specific traits during specific developmental windows. These results also strongly suggest that in N. vitripennis most sex-specific tissues fully differentiate in the embryonic stage and only need the input of NvDsx for growth afterwards. This provides a first insight into the regulatory activity of Dsx in the Hymenoptera and will help to better understand the evolutionary and molecular mechanisms involved in sex-specific development in this parasitoid wasp, which can eventually lead to the development of new synthetic genetics-based tools for biological pest control by parasitoid wasps.\n\nSignificance StatementIn insects, male and female differentiation is regulated by the highly conserved transcription factor Doublesex (Dsx). The role of Dsx in regulating rapidly evolving sexually dimorphic traits has received less attention, especially in wasps and bees. Here, we mainly focused on Dsx regulation of two sexually dimorphic traits and male genitalia morphology in the parasitoid wasp, Nasonia vitripennis. We demonstrate that Dsx actively regulates male-specific tissue growth and morphology during specific developmental windows. These findings will help to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the rapid evolution of sexual differentiation and sexually dimorphic traits in insects, but may also be the starting point for the development of new tools for biological control of pest insects by parasitoid wasps.",

Although various genetic and epigenetic mechanisms have been identified, the full molecular mechanisms deriving CRC tumorigenesis remains incompletely understood. In this study, we demonstrate that cell adhesion molecule transmembrane and immunoglobulin domain containing1 (TMIGD1) is highly expressed in mouse and human normal intestinal epithelial cells. We have developed TMIGD1 knockout mice and show that the loss of TMIGD1 in mice results in the development of adenomas in small intestine and colon. Additionally, the loss of TMIGD1 in mouse impaired intestinal epithelium brush border formation, junctional polarity and maturation. Mechanistically, TMIGD1 inhibits tumor cell proliferation, cell migration, arrests cell cycle at G2/M phase and induces expression of p21CIP1 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1), and p27KIP1 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B) expression, key cell cycle inhibitor proteins involved in the regulation of the cell cycle. Moreover, we demonstrate that TMIGD1 is progressively downregulated in sporadic human CRC and correlates with poor overall survival. Our findings identify TMIGD1 as a novel tumor suppressor gene and provide insights into the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer and possibilities as a potential therapeutic target.",

Psychophysical and anthropometric data were collected from 39 individuals with an obese body mass index (BMI) classification (BMI[&ge;]30) and 40 age/sex-matched individuals of a healthy BMI (BMI<24.9). Since BMI may be an inaccurate index of obesity, additional anthropometric parameters of central adiposity, and percent body fat (BF%) were examined. Pain responses to supra-threshold noxious heat and cold stimuli were examined. Subjects provided pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings to noxious heat (49{degrees}C) applied at varying durations (5s, 12s, 30s) and locations (ventral forearm/lower leg). Cold pain ratings, thresholds, and tolerances were obtained following immersion of the hand in a cold-water bath (0-2{degrees}C). Between-group differences in pain responses, as well as relationships between pain responses and obesity parameters were examined. Importantly, confounds that may influence pain such as anxiety, depression, impulsivity, sleepiness, and quality of life were assessed. No between-group differences in pain sensitivity to noxious heat and cold stimuli were found. After controlling for sex, no relationships were found between BMI, central adiposity, or BF% and pain responses to noxious heat or cold stimuli. These results indicate that obesity, BF%, and central adiposity have little influence on pain sensitivity in obese individuals. Accordingly, it is unlikely that obesity alone increases susceptibility for chronic pain development via amplification of nociceptive processes.",

    "abstract": "Monitoring translational regulation in response to environmental signals is crucial for understanding cellular proteostasis. However, only limited approaches are currently available for quantifying acute changes in protein synthesis induced by stimuli. Recently, a clickable puromycin analog, O-propargyl-puromycin (OPP), was developed and applied to label the C-termini of nascent polypeptide chains (NPCs). Following affinity purification via a click reaction, OPP allows for a proteomic analysis of NPCs. Despite its advantage, the affinity purification of NPCs using magnetic beads or resins inherently suffers from significant non-specific protein binding, which hinders accurate quantification of the nascent proteins. To address this issue, we employed dual pulse labeling of NPCs with both OPP and stable isotope labeled amino acids to distinguish bona fide NPCs from non-specific proteins, thereby enabling the accurate quantitative profiling of NPCs. We applied this method to dissecting the transcription-coupled translation responses and quantified ~3,000 nascent proteins. We found that the translation of a subset of ribosomal proteins (e.g., RPSA, RPLP0) as well as signaling proteins (e.g., BCAR3, EFNA1, DUSP1) was significantly repressed by transcription inhibition. Together, the present method provides an accurate and broadly applicable nascent proteome profiling for many biological applications at the level of translation.",

Here we show that targeting driver network signaling capacity by limited inhibition of its core pathways is a more effective anti-metastatic strategy. This principle underlies the action of a physiological metastasis suppressor, Raf Kinase Inhibitory Protein, which moderately decreases stress-regulated MAP kinase network activity, reducing the output to metastatic transcription factor BACH1 and motility-related target genes. We developed a low-dose four-drug mimic that blocks metastatic colonization in mouse breast cancer models and increases survival. Experiments and network flow modeling show: 1) limited inhibition of multiple pathways is required to overcome variation in MAPK network topology and suppress signaling output across heterogeneous tumor cells, and 2) restricting inhibition of individual kinases dissipates surplus signal, preventing threshold activation of compensatory kinase networks. This low-dose multi-drug approach to decrease signaling capacity of driver networks represents a transformative, clinically-relevant strategy for anti-metastatic treatment.",

    "abstract": "Human cell division is a highly regulated process that relies on the accurate capture and movement of chromosomes to the metaphase plate. Errors in the fidelity of chromosome congression and alignment can lead to improper chromosome segregation, which is correlated with aneuploidy and tumorigenesis. Here we show that the dual specificity phosphatase DUSP7 is important for regulating chromosome alignment. DUSP7 bound to ERK2 and regulated the abundance of active phospho-ERK2 through its phosphatase activity. Overexpression of DUSP7, but not catalytic dead mutants, led to a marked decrease in phopho-ERK2 and mitotic chromosome misalignment, while knockdown of DUSP7 also led to defective chromosome congression that resulted in a prolonged mitosis. Consistently, chemical inhibition of the MEK kinase that phosphorylates ERK2 or ERK2 itself led to chromosome alignment defects. Our results support a model where MEK phosphorylation and DUSP7 dephosphorylation regulate the levels of active phospho-ERK2 to promote proper cell division.",

Here, we evaluated whether scleroderma fibroblasts take advantage of the \"dont-eat-me-signal\" CD47 and whether blocking CD47 enables the bodys immune system to get rid of diseased fibroblasts. To test this approach, we used a Jun-inducible scleroderma model. We first demonstrated in patient samples that scleroderma upregulated JUN and increased promotor accessibilities of both JUN and the CD47. Next, we established our scleroderma model demonstrating that Jun mediated skin fibrosis through the hedgehog-dependent expansion of CD26+Sca1-fibroblasts in mice. In a niche-independent adaptive transfer model, JUN steered graft survival and conferred increased self-renewal to fibroblasts. In vivo, JUN enhanced the expression of CD47, and inhibiting CD47 eliminated an ectopic fibroblast graft and increased in vitro phagocytosis. In the syngeneic mouse, depleting macrophages ameliorated skin fibrosis. Therapeutically, combined CD47 and IL6 blockade reversed skin fibrosis in mice and led to the rapid elimination of ectopically transplanted scleroderma cells. Altogether, our study is the first to demonstrate the efficiency of combining different immunotherapies in treating scleroderma and provide a rationale for combining CD47 and IL6 inhibition in clinical trials.",

Most are produced in cultured mammalian cells which is expensive, limiting their availability. Goats, striking a good balance between a relatively short generation time and copious milk yield, present an alternative platform for the cost-effective, flexible, large-scale production of therapeutic mAbs. Here, we focused on cetuximab, a mAb against epidermal growth factor receptor, that is commercially produced under the brand name Erbitux and approved for anti-cancer treatments. We generated several transgenic goat lines that produce cetuximab in their milk. Two lines were selected for detailed characterization. Both showed stable genotypes and cetuximab production levels of up to 10g/L. The mAb could be readily purified and showed improved characteristics compared to Erbitux. The goat-produced cetuximab (gCetuximab) lacked a highly immunogenic epitope that is part of Erbitux. Moreover, it showed enhanced binding to CD16 and increased antibody-dependent cell-dependent cytotoxicity compared to Erbitux. This indicates that these goats produce an improved cetuximab version with the potential for enhanced effectiveness and better safety profile compared to treatments with Erbitux. In addition, our study validates transgenic goats as an excellent platform for large-scale production of therapeutic mAbs.",

Here we discover a novel fat-derived \u201cadipokine\u201d neurotrophic factor neurotrophin 3 (NTF3) and its receptor Tropomyosin receptor kinase C (TRKC) as key regulators of SNS growth and innervation in adipose tissue. NTF3 is highly expressed in brown/beige adipocytes, and potently stimulates sympathetic neuron neurite growth. NTF3/TRKC regulates a plethora of pathways in neuronal axonal growth and elongation. Adipose tissue sympathetic innervation is significantly increased in mice with adipocyte-specific NTF3 overexpression, but profoundly reduced in mice with TRKC haploinsufficiency (TRKC+/-). Increasing NTF3 via pharmacological or genetic approach promotes beige adipocyte development, enhances cold-induced thermogenesis and protects against diet-induced obesity (DIO); whereas TRKC+/- mice or SNS TRKC deficient mice are cold intolerant and prone to DIO. Thus, NTF3 is an important fat-derived neurotrophic factor regulating SNS innervation, energy metabolism and obesity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "BackgroundProtein expression patterns underlie physiological processes and phenotypic differences including those occurring during early development. The Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) undergoes a major phenotypic change in early development from free-swimming larval form to sessile benthic dweller while proliferating in environments with broad temperature ranges. Despite the economic and ecological importance of the species, physiological processes occurring throughout metamorphosis and the impact of temperature on these processes have not yet been mapped out.\n\nResultsTowards this, we comprehensively characterized protein abundance patterns for 7978 proteins throughout metamorphosis in the Pacific oyster at different temperature regimes. We used a multi-statistical approach including principal component analysis, ANOVA-simultaneous component analysis, and hierarchical clustering coupled with functional enrichment analysis to characterize these data. We identified distinct sets of proteins with time-dependent abundances generally not affected by temperature. Over 12 days, adhesion and calcification related proteins acutely decreased, organogenesis and extracellular matrix related proteins gradually decreased, proteins related to signaling showed sinusoidal abundance patterns, and proteins related to metabolic and growth processes gradually increased. Contrastingly, different sets of proteins showed temperature-dependent abundance patterns with proteins related to immune response showing lower abundance and catabolic pro-growth processes showing higher abundance in animals reared at 29{degrees}C relative to 23{degrees}C.\n\nConclusionAlthough time was a stronger driver than temperature of metamorphic proteome changes, temperature-induced proteome differences led to pro-growth physiology corresponding to larger oyster size at 29{degrees}C, and to altered specific metamorphic processes and possible pathogen presence at 23{degrees}C. These findings offer high resolution insight into why oysters may experience high mortality rates during this life transition in both field and culture settings. The proteome resource generated by this study provides data-driven guidance for future work on developmental changes in molluscs. Furthermore, the analytical approach taken here provides a foundation for effective shotgun proteomic analyses across a variety of taxa.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation is the primary pathological feature of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers (AD) and Parkinsons disease. Proinflammatory molecules (e.g. S100A9) play important roles during progression of the diseases by regulating behavior and fate of multiple cell types in the nervous system (1). Our earlier studies reveal that S100A9 is toxic to neurons, and its interaction with A{beta} peptides leads to the formation of large non-toxic amyloidogenic aggregates, suggesting a protective role of A{beta} amyloids (2). We herein, demonstrate that S100A9 interacts with neural stem cells (NSCs) and causes NSC differentiation. In the brain of transgenic AD mouse models, we found large quantities of proinflammatory S100A9, which colocalizes with the differentiated NSCs. NSC sphere formation, which is a representative character of NSC stemness, is also substantially inhibited by S100A9. These results suggest that S100A9 is a representative marker for the inflammatory conditions in AD, and it promotes NSC differentiation. Intriguingly, in contrast to the death of both stem and differentiated NSCs caused by high S100A9 doses, S100A9 at a moderate concentration is toxic only to the early differentiated NSCs (i.e. progenitor cells and immature neurons), but not the stem cells. We therefore postulate that at the early stage of AD, expression of S100A9 leads to NSC differentiation, which remedies the neuron damages. The application drugs, which help maintain NSC stemness (e.g. PDGF), may help overcome the acute inflammatory conditions and improve the efficacy of NSC transplantation therapy.",

    "abstract": "Guard cells regulate plant gas exchange by controlling the aperture of stomatal pores. The process of stomatal closure involves a multi-input signaling network that governs the activity of ion channels, which in turn regulate guard cell turgor pressure and volume. Here we describe a forward genetic screen to identify novel components involved in stomatal movements. Through an ozone-sensitivity approach combined with whole-rosette gas exchange analysis, 130 mutants of established stomatal regulators and 76 novel mutants impaired in stomatal closure were identified. One of the novel mutants was mapped to MURUS1 (MUR1), the first enzyme in de novo GDP-L-fucose biosynthesis. Defects in synthesis or import of GDP-L-Fuc into the Golgi apparatus resulted in impaired stomatal closure to multiple stimuli. Stomatal phenotypes observed in mur1 were independent from the canonical guard cell signaling and instead could be related to altered mechanical properties of guard cell walls. Impaired fucosylation of xyloglucan, N-linked glycans and arabinogalactan proteins did not explain the aberrant function of mur1 stomata, however our data suggest that the stomatal phenotypes observed in mur1 can at least partially be attributed to defective dimerization of rhamnogalactouronan-II. In addition to providing the genetic framework for future studies on guard cell signaling, our work emphasizes the impact of fucose metabolism on stomatal movement.",

    "abstract": "Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) is a major cause of nosocomial infections and hospital outbreaks worldwide, remaining a critical clinical concern. Here we characterized and investigated the phylogenetic relationships of 105 CRAB isolates on intensive care unit surfaces from one hospital in China collected over six years. All strains carried blaOXA-23, blaOXA-66 genes for carbapenem resistance, also had high resistance gene, virulence factor and insertion sequences burdens. Whole-genome sequencing revealed all strains belonged to ST2, the global clone CC2. The phylogenetic analysis based on the core genome showed all isolates was dominated by a single lineage of three clusters and eight different clones. Two clones were popular during the collection time. Using chi-square test to identify the epidemiologically meaningful groupings, we found the significant difference in community structure only present in strains from separation time. The haplotype and median-joining network analysis revealed genetic differences among clusters and changes occurred overtime in the dominating cluster. Our results highlighted substantial multidrug-resistant CRAB burden in hospital ICU environment, demonstrated potential clone outbreak in hospital.",

    "abstract": "Viruses have colonized the germ line of our ancestors at several occasions during evolution, leading to the integration in the human genome of viral sequences from over 30 retroviral groups and a few non-retroviruses. Among the recently emerged viruses infecting humans, several target the testis (eg HIV, Zika and Ebola viruses). Here we aimed to investigate whether human testicular germ cells (TGCs) can support integration by HIV, a contemporary retrovirus that started to spread in the human population during the last century. We report that albeit alternative receptors enabled HIV-1 binding to TGCs, HIV virions failed to infect TGCs in vitro. Nevertheless, exposure of TGCs to infected lymphocytes, naturally present in the testis from HIV+ men, led to HIV-1 entry, integration and early protein expression. Similarly, cell-associated infection or bypassing viral entry led to HIV-1 integration in a spermatogonial cell line. Using DNAscope, HIV-1 and SIV DNA were detected within a few TGCs in the testis from one infected patient, one rhesus macaque and one African Green monkey in vivo. Molecular landscape analysis revealed that early TGCs were enriched in HIV early co-factors up to integration and had overall low antiviral defenses when compared with testicular macrophages and Sertoli cells. In conclusion, our study reveals that TGCs can support the entry and integration of HIV upon cell-associated infection. This could represent a way for this contemporary virus to integrate our germline and become endogenous in the future, as happened during human evolution for a number of viruses.\n\nImportanceViruses have colonized the host germ line at many occasions during evolution to eventually become endogenous. Here we aimed at investigating whether human testicular germ cells (TGCs) can support such viral invasion by studying HIV interactions with TGCs in vitro. Our results indicate that isolated primary TGCs express alternative HIV-1 receptors allowing virions binding but not entry. However, HIV-1 entered and integrated in TGCs upon cell-associated infection, and produced low level of viral proteins. In vivo, HIV-1 and SIV DNA was detected in a few TGCs. Molecular landscape analysis showed that TGCs have overall weak antiviral defenses. Altogether, our results indicate that human TGCs can support HIV-1 early replication including integration, suggesting potential for endogenization in the future generations.",

    "abstract": "The widespread of antibiotic resistance (ABR) among bacteria has become a global health concern for humans, animals and the environment. In this respect, beta-lactams and colistin are of particular interest due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria. Households provide a habitat for bacteria originating from humans, animals, foods, contaminated clothes or other sources in which detergents and biocides are frequently used. Thus, bacteria carrying antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) might be introduced into private households and may consequently be also released from households to the environment via domestic wastewater. Since data on ABR in the domestic environment is limited, this study aimed to determine the abundance and correlation of beta-lactamase, mobile colistin resistance and class 1 integron genes and to characterize phenotypic resistant strains in private households in Germany. Additionally, the persistence of ABR bacteria to laundering and automated dishwashing was assessed. Shower drains, washing machines and dishwashers were sampled and analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR. Resistant strains were isolated, followed by identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing using VITEK 2. The results show a significantly higher occurrence of ARGs in shower drains compared to washing machines and dishwashers. Several beta-lactamase genes co-occurred and resistance of bacterial isolates correlated positively with genotypic resistance. Laundering and automated dishwashing reduced ABR bacteria significantly and the efficacy increased with increasing duration and temperature. Overall, the domestic environment seems to represent a potential reservoir of beta-lactamase genes and beta-lactam resistant bacteria with shower drains as the dominant source of ABR.\n\nImportanceThe abundance of ABR bacteria and ARGs is steadily increasing and has been comprehensively analyzed in natural environments, animals, foods or wastewater treatment plants. Despite of their connection to these environments, private households seem to be neglected. Therefore, the present study investigated shower drains, washing machines and dishwashers as possible sites of ARGs and ABR bacteria. The analysis of the domestic environment as a potential reservoir of resistant bacteria is crucial to determine whether households contribute to the spread of ABR or are a habitat where resistant bacteria from the environment, humans, food or water accumulate.",

    "abstract": "Aims The estrogen-inducible protein Heat Shock Protein 27 (HSP27) as well as anti-HSP27 antibodies are elevated in healthy subjects compared to cardiovascular disease patients. Vaccination of ApoE-/- mice with recombinant HSP25 (rHSP25, the murine ortholog), boosts anti-HSP25 levels and attenuates atherogenesis. As estrogens promote HSP27 synthesis, cellular release and blood levels, we hypothesize that menopause will result in loss of HSP27 atheroprotection. Hence, we now compare the efficacy of rHSP25 vaccination vs. estradiol (E2) therapy for the prevention of post-menopausal atherogenesis.Methods and Results ApoE-/- mice subjected to ovariectomy (OVX) showed a 65% increase atherosclerotic burden compared to sham mice after 5 weeks of a high fat diet. Relative to vaccination with rC1, a truncated HSP27 control peptide, atherogenesis was reduced by 5-weekly rHSP25 vaccinations (\u221243%), a subcutaneous E2 slow release pellet (\u221252%) or a combination thereof (\u221282%). Plasma cholesterol levels declined in parallel with the reductions in atherogenesis, but relative to rC1/OVX mice plasma PCSK9 levels were 52% higher in E2/OVX and 41% lower in rHSP25/OVX mice (p&lt;0.0001 for both). Hepatic LDLR mRNA levels did not change with E2 treatment but increased markedly with rHSP25 vaccination. Conversely, hepatic PCSK9 mRNA increased 148% with E2 treatment vs. rC1/OVX but did not change with rHSP25 vaccination. In human HepG2 hepatocytes E2 increased PCSK9 promoter activity 303%, while the combination of [rHSP27 + PAb] decreased PCSK9 promoter activity by 64%.Conclusion The reduction in post-OVX atherogenesis and cholesterol levels with rHSP25 vaccination is associated with increased LDLR but not PCSK9 expression. Surprisingly, E2 therapy attenuates atherogenesis and cholesterol levels post-OVX without altering LDLR but increases PCSK9 expression and promoter activity. This is the first documentation of increased PCSK9 expression with E2 therapy and raises questions about balancing physiological estrogenic / PCSK9 homeostasis and targeting PCSK9 in women \u2013 are there effects beyond cholesterol?Competing Interest StatementEOB and YXC are inventors on US patents 8343915B2 and 8343916B2; EOB, CS and YXC are inventors on US patent application PCT/CA2016/051018; EOB is the inventor on US patent application 63/031,6402020; all intellectual property pertains to HSP27 diagnostics / therapeutics.

    "abstract": "RationaleAddiction to methamphetamine (MA) is a major public health issue in the United States. While psychostimulant use disorders are heritable, their genetic basis remains poorly understood. We previously identified heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1 (Hnrnph1; H1) as a quantitative trait gene underlying sensitivity to MA-induced locomotor activity. Mice heterozygous for a frameshift deletion in the first coding exon of H1 (H1+/-) showed reduced MA phenotypes including oral self-administration, locomotor activity, dopamine release, and dose-dependent differences in MA conditioned place preference. However, the effects of H1+/- on innate and MA-modulated reward sensitivity are not known.\n\nObjectivesWe examined innate reward sensitivity and modulation by MA in H1+/- mice via intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS).\n\nMethodsWe used intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) of the medial forebrain bundle to assess shifts in reward sensitivity following acute, ascending doses of MA (0.5-4.0 mg/kg, i.p.) using a within-subjects design. We also assessed video-recorded behaviors during ICSS testing sessions.\n\nResultsH1+/- mice displayed reduced normalized maximum response rates, H1+/- females showed lower normalized M50 values compared to wild-type females following MA, and H1+/- influenced ICSS responding relative to maximum baseline rates. There was a dose-dependent reduction in distance to the response wheel following MA administration, providing an additional measure of reward-related behavior.\n\nConclusionsH1+/- mice displayed reduced reward facilitation following MA in a sex- and dose-dependent manner. This result expands upon the set of MA-induced phenotypes observed in H1+/- mice.",

    "abstract": "Impulsivity is a key trait in the diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) and substance use disorder (SUD). MDD is a chronic illness characterized by sadness, insomnia, and loss of interest. SUD is a chronic and relapsing disorder characterized by the consumption of drugs despite their negative consequences. Among drugs of abuse, cocaine is the most consumed psychostimulant. Animal studies demonstrated that increased impulsivity predicts predisposition to acquire cocaine self-administration (SA) behaviour with an increased cocaine-intake. Moreover, early-life stress represents a vulnerability factor to develop depressive disorders and drug addiction. Maternal separation with early weaning (MSEW) is an animal model that allows examining the impact of early-life stress on cocaine abuse. In this study, we aimed to explore changes in MSEW-induced impulsivity to determine potential associations between depression-like and cocaine-seeking behaviours in male and female mice. We also evaluated possible alterations in the AMPA receptors (AMPArs) composition and glutamatergic neurotransmission. We exposed mice to MSEW and the behavioural tests were performed during adulthood. Moreover, GluA1, GluA2 mRNA and protein expression were evaluated in the medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC). Results showed higher impulsive cocaine-seeking in females, independently the MSEW, as well as an increase in GluA1 and GluA2 protein expression. Moreover, MSEW induced downregulation of Gria2 and increased the GluA1/GluA2 ratio, only in male mice. In conclusion, female mice expressed higher mPFC glutamatergic function, which potentiated their impulsivity during cocaine SA. Also, data indicated that MSEW alters glutamatergic function in mPFC of male mice, increasing the glutamatergic excitability.",

    "abstract": "Speech processing relies on interactions between auditory and motor systems and is asymmetrically organized in the human brain. The left auditory system is specialized for processing of phonemes, whereas the right is specialized for processing of pitch changes in speech that affect prosody. In speakers of tonal languages, however, processing of pitch (i.e., tone) changes that alter word meaning is left-lateralized. This indicates that linguistic function and language experience shape auditory speech processing asymmetries; their effect on auditory-motor speech processing remains unknown, however. Here, we investigated the asymmetry of motor contributions to auditory speech processing in speakers of tonal and non-tonal languages. We temporarily disrupted the left or right speech motor cortex using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and measured the impact of these disruptions on auditory processing of phoneme and tone changes in sequences of syllables using electroencephalography (EEG). We found that disruption of the speech motor cortex in the left, but not the right hemisphere, impaired processing of phoneme changes in both language groups equally. In contrast, the effect of motor disruptions on processing of tone changes differed in tonal and non-tonal language groups: disruption of the left speech motor cortex significantly impaired processing of tone changes in tonal language speakers, whereas disruption of the right speech motor cortex modulated processing of tone changes in non-tonal speakers. We conclude that the contribution of the left and right speech motor cortex to auditory speech processing is determined by the functional role of the acoustic cues in the listeners native language.\n\nSignificance StatementThe principles underlying hemispheric asymmetries of auditory speech processing remain debated. The asymmetry of auditory speech processing is affected by the low-level acoustic cues, but also by their linguistic function. By combining TMS and EEG, we investigated the asymmetry of motor contributions to auditory speech processing in tonal and non-tonal language speakers. For the first time, we provide causal evidence that auditory-motor speech processing asymmetries are shaped by the functional role of the acoustic cues in the listeners native language. The lateralised top-down motor influences are likely to affect asymmetry of speech processing in the auditory system.",

However, the evaluation of mitochondrial health in the brain is not incorporated into clinical practice due to ethical and logistical concerns. As a result, the development of targeted mitochondrial therapeutics remains a significant challenge due to the lack of appropriate patient-derived brain tissues. To address these unmet needs, we developed cerebral organoids (COs) from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and monitored mitochondrial health from the primary, reprogrammed and differentiated stages. Our results show preserved mitochondrial genetics, function and treatment responses across PBMCs to iPSCs to COs, and measurable neuronal activity in the COs.

The nanoparticles moved unobstructed within endothelial cells, but transcytosis across the BBB occurred only at post-capillary venules, where endothelial and glial basement membranes form a perivascular space that can accommodate biologics. In comparison, transcytosis was absent in capillaries with closely apposed basement membranes. Thus, post-capillary venules, not capillaries, provide an entry point for transport of large molecules across the BBB, and targeting therapeutic agents to this locus may be an effective way for treating brain disorders.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIIntegration of drug carrier nanotechnology with two-photon microscopy in vivo\nC_LIO_LIReal-time nanoscale-resolution imaging of nanoparticle transcytosis to the brain\nC_LIO_LIDistinct trafficking pattern in the endothelium of cerebral venules and capillaries\nC_LIO_LIVenules, not capillaries, is the locus for brain uptake of therapeutic nanoparticles\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The causative agent of the current pandemic and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1. Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 enters and spreads within human organs is crucial for developing strategies to prevent viral dissemination. For many viruses, tissue tropism is determined by the availability of virus receptors on the surface of host cells2. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a host receptor, yet, their tropisms differ3-5. Here, we found that the cellular receptor neuropilin-1 (NRP1), known to bind furin-cleaved substrates, significantly potentiates SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, which was inhibited by a monoclonal blocking antibody against the extracellular b1b2 domain of NRP1. NRP1 is abundantly expressed in the respiratory and olfactory epithelium, with highest expression in endothelial cells and in the epithelial cells facing the nasal cavity. Neuropathological analysis of human COVID-19 autopsies revealed SARS-CoV-2 infected NRP1-positive cells in the olfactory epithelium and bulb. In the olfactory bulb infection was detected particularly within NRP1-positive endothelial cells of small capillaries and medium-sized vessels. Studies in mice demonstrated, after intranasal application, NRP1-mediated transport of virus-sized particles into the central nervous system. Thus, NRP1 could explain the enhanced tropism and spreading of SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 has become a major challenge to global health, and until now, no efficient antiviral agents have been developed. The SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by pulmonary and systemic inflammation in severe patients, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused respiratory failure contributes to most mortalities. There is an urgent need for developing effective drugs and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 caused ARDS. However, most researchers cannot perform SARS-CoV-2 related researches due to lacking P3 or P4 facility. We developed a non-infectious, highly safety, time-saving SARS-CoV-2 components induced murine model to study the SARS-CoV-2 caused ARDS and cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). We also investigated mAbs and inhibitors which potentially neutralize the pro-inflammatory phenotype of COVID-19, and found that anti-IL-1, anti-IL-6, anti-TNF, anti-GM-CSF mAbs, p38 inhibitor, and JAK inhibitor partially relieved CSS. Besides, anti-IL-6, anti-TNF, anti-GM-CSF mAbs and inhibitors of p38, ERK, and MPO somewhat reduced neutrophilic alveolitis in the lung. In all, we established the murine model mimic of COVID-19, opening a biosafety and less time-consuming avenue for clarifying the mechanism of ARDS and CSS in COVID-19 and developing the therapeutic drugs.",

The male germ cells differentiate and mature with the formation of syncytia, failure of forming the appropriate syncytia results in the arrest of spermatogenesis at the spermatocyte stage. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms of male germ cell morphological regulation are unknown. Here, we found that EXOC1 is important for the pseudopod formation of spermatogonia and spermatocyte syncytia in mice. We found that while EXOC1 contributes to the inactivation of Rac1 in the pseudopod formation of spermatogonia, in spermatocyte syncytium formation, EXOC1 and SNAP23 cooperate with STX2. Our results showed that EXOC1 functions in concert with various cell morphology regulators in spermatogenesis. Since EXOC1 is known to bind to several cell morphogenesis factors, this study is expected to be the starting point for the discovery of many morphological regulators of male germ cells.",

    "abstract": "The characterization of developmental phenotypes often relies on the accurate linear measurement of structures that are small and require laborious preparation. This is tedious and prone to errors, especially when repeated for the multiple replicates that are required for statistical analysis, or when multiple distinct structures have to be analysed. To address this issue, we have developed a pipeline for characterization of long-bone length and inter-vertebral distance using X-ray microtomography (XMT) scans. The pipeline involves semi-automated algorithms for automatic thresholding and fast interactive isolation and 3D-model generation of the main limb bones, using either the open-source ImageJ plugin BoneJ or the commercial Mimics Innovation Suite package. The tests showed the appropriate combination of scanning conditions and analysis parameters yields fast and comparable length results, highly correlated with the measurements obtained via ex vivo skeletal preparations. Moreover, since XMT is not destructive, the samples can be used afterwards for histology or other applications. Our new pipelines will help developmental biologists and evolutionary researchers to achieve fast, reproducible and non-destructive length measurement of bone samples from multiple animal species.\n\nSummary statementBeltran Diaz et al. present a semi-automated pipeline for fast and versatile characterization of bone length from micro-CT images of mouse developmental samples.",

    "abstract": "Escherichia coli Sequence Type (ST)101 is an emerging, multi-drug resistant lineage associated with carbapenem resistance. We recently completed a comprehensive genomics study on mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and their role in blaNDM-1 dissemination within the ST101 lineage. DNA methyltransferases (MTases) are also frequently associated with MGEs, with DNA methylation guiding numerous biological processes including genomic defence against foreign DNA and regulation of gene expression. The availability of Pacific Biosciences Single Molecule Real Time Sequencing data for seven ST101 strains enabled us to investigate the role of DNA methylation on a genome-wide scale (methylome). We defined the methylome of two complete (MS6192 and MS6193) and five draft (MS6194, MS6201, MS6203, MS6204, MS6207) ST101 genomes. Our analysis identified 14 putative MTases and eight N6-methyladenine DNA recognition sites, with one site that has not been described previously. Furthermore, we identified a Type I MTase encoded within a Transposon 7-like Transposon and show its acquisition leads to differences in the methylome between two almost identical isolates. Genomic comparisons with 13 previously published ST101 draft genomes identified variations in MTase distribution, consistent with MGE differences between genomes, highlighting the diversity of active MTases within strains of a single E. coli lineage. It is well established that MGEs can contribute to the evolution of E. coli due to their virulence and resistance gene repertoires. This study emphasises the potential for mobile genetic elements to also enable highly similar bacterial strains to rapidly acquire genome-wide functional differences via changes to the methylome.\n\nImpact StatementEscherichia coli ST101 is an emerging human pathogen frequently associated with carbapenem resistance. E. coli ST101 strains carry numerous mobile genetic elements that encode virulence determinants, antimicrobial resistance, and DNA methyltransferases (MTases). In this study we provide the first comprehensive analysis of the genome-wide complement of DNA methylation (methylome) in seven E. coli ST101 genomes. We identified a Transposon carrying a Type I restriction modification system that may lead to functional differences between two almost identical genomes and showed how small recombination events at a single genomic region can lead to global methylome changes across the lineage. We also showed that the distribution of MTases throughout the ST101 lineage was consistent with the presence or absence of mobile genetic elements on which they are encoded. This study shows the diversity of MTases within a single bacterial lineage and shows how strain and lineage-specific methylomes may drive host adaptation.\n\nData SummarySequence data including reads, assemblies and motif summaries have previously been submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) under the BioProject Accessions: PRJNA580334, PRJNA580336, PRJNA580337, PRJNA580338, PRJNA580339, PRJNA580341 and PRJNA580340 for MS6192, MS6193, MS6194, MS6201, MS6203, MS6204 and MS6207 respectively.

Here, we show that MEK inhibition enhanced PD-L1 expression while PD-L1 blockade upregulated MAPK signaling in mutant KRAS lung tumors. Combined MEK inhibition with anti-PD-L1 synergistically reduced lung tumor growth and metastasis, but tumors eventually developed resistance to sustained combinatorial therapy. Multi-platform profiling revealed that resistant lung tumors have increased infiltration of Th17 cells, which secrete IL-17 and IL-22 cytokines to promote lung cancer cell invasiveness and MEK inhibitor resistance. Antibody depletion of IL-17A in combination with MEK inhibition and PD-L1 blockade markedly reduced therapy-resistance in vivo. Clinically, increased expression of Th17-associated genes in melanoma patients treated with PD-1 blockade predicted poorer overall survival and response. Our study validates a triple combinatorial therapeutic strategy to overcome resistance to combined MEK inhibitor and PD-L1 blockade.",

Sequencing of resistant clones revealed shared and media-specific mutational outcomes, with an overlap in cell wall regulons (walKRyycHI, vraSRT). Evolved strains displayed similar genetic and phenotypic traits to resistant clinical isolates. Importantly, resistant phenotypes that developed in physiological media did not translate into resistance in bacteriological media.

    "abstract": "Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a key technology at many wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for converting surplus activated sludge to methane-rich biogas. However, the limited number of surveys and the lack of comprehensive data sets have hindered a deeper understanding of the characteristics and associations between key variables and the microbiome composition. Here, we present a six-year survey of 46 anaerobic digesters, located at 22 WWTPs in Denmark, which is the largest known study of the microbial ecology of AD at WWTPs at a regional scale. For three types of AD (mesophilic, mesophilic with thermal hydrolysis pretreatment, and thermophilic), we present the typical value range of 12 key parameters including operational variables and performance parameters. The bacterial and archaeal microbiomes were analyzed at species-level resolution using amplicon sequencing in >1,000 samples and the new ecosystem-specific MiDAS 3 reference database. We detected 42 phyla, 1,600 genera and 3,584 species in the bacterial microbiome, where 70% of the genera and 93% of the species represented uncultivated taxa that were only classified based on MiDAS 3 denovo placeholder taxonomy. More than 40% of the 100 most abundant bacterial species did not grow in the digesters and were only present due to immigration with the feed sludge. Temperature, ammonium concentration, and pH were the main drivers shaping the microbiome clusters of the three types of ADs for both bacteria and for archaea. Within mesophilic digesters, feed sludge composition and other key parameters (organic loading rate, biogas yield, and ammonium concentration) correlated with the growing bacterial microbiome. Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed the main drivers for specific species among growing bacteria and archaea, and revealed the potential ecological function of many novel taxa. Our study highlights the influence of immigration on bacterial AD microbiome. Subsetting the growing microbes improves the understanding of the diversity and main drivers of microbiome assembly, and elucidates functionality of specific species-level microorganisms. This six-year survey provides a comprehensive insight into microbiome structure at species level, engineering and ecological performance, and a foundation for future studies of the ecological significance/characteristics and function of the novel taxa.",

A 10-min treatment with NB-O3 in 50 L water generated approximately 2-3 x 107 bubbles with majority sizes less than 130 nm and ozone level of [~]800 mV ORP. A single treatment with water contaminated with either Streptococcus agalactiae or Aeromonas veronii effectively reduced 96.11-97.92 % of the bacterial load. This same protocol was repeated 3 times with 99.93-99.99 % reduction in the bacterial concentration. In comparison, bacterial concentration the control tanks remained the same level during the experiments. In fish-cultured water with the presence of organic matter (e.g. mucus, feces, bacterial flora, feed, etc.), the disinfection property of NB-O3 was reduced i.e bacterial concentration was reduced by 42.94 %, 84.94 % and 99.27 % after the first, second and third treatments, respectively. To evaluate the safety of NB-O3 to fish, juvenile Nile tilapia were exposed to NB-O3 treatment for 10 minutes. No mortality was observed during the treatment or 48 h post treatment. Gill histology examination revealed that a single NB-O3 treatment caused no alteration morphology. However, damage in the gill filaments was noticed in the fish receiving two or three consecutive exposures within the same day. Results of all the experiments conducted in this study suggest that NB-O3 technology is promising for controlling pathogenic bacteria in aquaculture systems, and may be useful at reducing the risk of bacterial disease outbreaks in farmed fish.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, (re-)emerging arboviruses including Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Mayaro virus (MAYV) have caused growing concern due to expansion of insect vector ranges. No protective vaccine or specific antiviral strategies are currently available. Long-term morbidity after CHIKV infection includes debilitating chronic joint pain, which has associated health and economic impact. Here, we analyzed the early cell-intrinsic response to CHIKV and MAYV infection in primary human synovial fibroblasts. This interferon-competent cell type represents a potential source of polyarthralgia induced by CHIKV infection. Synovial fibroblasts from healthy and osteoarthritic donors were similarly permissive to CHIKV and MAYV infection ex vivo. Using RNA-seq, we defined a CHIKV infection-induced transcriptional profile with several hundred interferon-stimulated and arthralgia-mediating genes upregulated. Type I interferon was both secreted by infected fibroblasts and protective when administered exogenously. IL-6 secretion, which mediates chronic synovitis, however, was not boosted by infection. Single-cell RNA-seq and flow cytometric analyses uncovered an inverse correlation of activation of innate immunity and productive infection at the level of individual cells. In summary, primary human synovial fibroblasts serve as bona-fide ex vivo primary cell model of CHIKV infection and provide a valuable platform for studies of joint tissue-associated aspects of CHIKV immunopathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was first reported in Wuhan, China in November 2019 has developed into a pandemic since March 2020, causing substantial human casualties and economic losses. Studies on SARS-CoV-2 are being carried out at an unprecedented rate to tackle this threat. Genomics studies, in particular, are indispensable to elucidate the dynamic nature of the RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2. RNA viruses are marked by their unique ability to undergo high rates of mutation in their genome, much more frequently than their hosts, which diversifies their strengths qualifying them to elude host immune response and amplify drug resistance. In this study, we sequenced and analyzed the genomic information of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates from two infected Indian patients and explored the possible implications of point mutations in its biology. In addition to multiple point mutations, we found a remarkable similarity between relatively common mutations of 36-nucleotide deletion in ORF8 of SARS-CoV-2. Our results corroborate with the earlier reported 29-nucleotide deletion in SARS, which was frequent during the early stage of human-to-human transmission. The results will be useful to understand the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and itsattenuation for vaccine development.",

    "abstract": "Sialic acid residues found as terminal monosaccharides in various types of glycan chains in cell surface glycoproteins and glycolipids have been identified as important contributors of cell-cell interactions in normal vs. abnormal cellular behavior and are pivotal in diseases such as cancers. In vertebrates, sialic acids are attached to glycan chains by a conserved subset of sialyltransferases with different enzymatic and substrate specificities. ST6Gal I is a sialyltransferase using activated CMP-sialic acids as donor substrates to catalyze the formation of a 2,6-glycosidic bond between the sialic acid residue and the acceptor disaccharide LacNAc. Understanding sialyltransferases at the molecular and structural level shed light into the function. We present here two human ST6Gal I structures, which show for the first time the enzyme in the unliganded state and with the full donor substrate CMP-Neu5Ac bound. Comparison of these structures reveal flexibility of the catalytic loop, since in the unliganded structure Tyr354 adopts a conformation seen also as an alternate conformation in the substrate bound structure. CMP-Neu5Ac is bound with the side chain at C-5 of the sugar residue directed towards empty space at the surface of the protein. Furthermore, the exact binding mode of the sialic acid moiety of the substrate directly involves sialylmotifs L, S and III and positions the sialylmotif VS in the immediate vicinity.\n\nPROTEIN DATA BANK ACCESSION CODESAtomic coordinates and structure factors of the human wild-type unliganded and CMP-Neu5Ac bound ST6Gal I have been deposited with the PDB with accession codes 6QVS and 6QVT, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor beta/delta (PPAR{beta}/{delta}) is a nuclear receptor ubiquitously expressed in cells whose signaling controls inflammation and metabolism. However, there are great discrepancies in understanding the role of PPAR{beta}/{delta}, having both anti- and pro-effects on inflammation. Understanding the PPAR{beta}/{delta} mechanism of action may provide new molecular mechanisms for treating a variety of inflammatory-related diseases.\n\nWe studied the PPAR{beta}/{delta}-regulation of LPS-induced inflammation of pulmonary artery, bronchi and parenchyma from rat, using different combinations of agonists (GW0742 or L-165402) and antagonists (GSK3787 or GSK0660). LPS-induced inflammation is largely regulated by PPAR{beta}/{delta} in the pulmonary artery, but it is a minor factor in bronchi or parenchyma. Agonists do not significantly inhibit inflammation, but activates the PPAR{beta}/{delta} induction mode of action. Surprisingly, co-incubation of the tissue with agonist plus antagonist shows anti-inflammatory effects and switches the PPAR{beta}/{delta} mode of action from induction to trans-repression, indicating that the PPAR{beta}/{delta} induction mode of action is pro-inflammatory and the trans-repression anti-inflammatory. Us of Computational chemistry methods indicates that PPAR{beta}/{delta} agonists are predicted to form polar interactions with the residues His287, His413 and Tyr437 whilst PPAR{beta}/{delta} antagonists form polar interactions with the residues Thr252 and Asn307. Further, our modelling indicates favorable binding energies and the feasibility of simultaneous binding of two ligands in the PPAR{beta}/{delta} binding pocket. In summary, this study provides novel insight into the complex relationship between ligand binding profiles and functional outcomes in a rat lung inflammation model, which will help inform the design of novel therapies for inflammatory lung diseases.",

However, approaches that allow encapsulin nanoreactors to be functionally activated with spatial and temporal precision is lacking. We report the construction of a light-responsive encapsulin nanoreactor for \u201con-demand\u201d production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Herein, encapsulins were loaded with the fluorescent flavoprotein mini-Singlet Oxygen Generator (miniSOG), a biological photosensitizer that is activated by blue-light to generate ROS, primarily singlet oxygen (1O2). We established that the nanocompartments stably encased miniSOG, and in response to blue-light were able to mediate the photoconversion of molecular oxygen into ROS. Using an in vitro model of lung cancer, ROS generated by the nanoreactor was shown to trigger photosensitized oxidation reactions that exerted a toxic effect on tumour cells, suggesting utility in photodynamic therapy. This encapsulin nanoreactor thus represents a platform for the light-controlled initiation and/or modulation of ROS-driven processes in biomedicine and biotechnology.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

However, for the fragmentization of disease module in incomplete human interactome, how to determine connectivity pattern and detect a full neighbourhood of disease is an open problem. In this paper, a topology-based method is developed to dissect the connectivity of intermediate nodes and edges and form a succinct disease module. By applying this Connect separate Connected Components (CCC, C3) method on a large corpus of curated diseases, we find that most Separate Connected Components (SCCs) formed by Disease-Associated Proteins (DAPs) can be connected into a well-connected component as a succinct observable module. This pattern also holds for altered genes from multi-omics data such as The Cancer Genome Atlas. Overall, C3 tool can not only inspire a deeper understanding of interconnectedness of phenotypically related genes and different omics data, but also be used to detect a well-defined neighbourhood that drives complex pathological processes.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell sequencing yields novel discoveries by distinguishing cell types, states and lineages within the context of heterogeneous tissues. However, interpreting complex single-cell data from highly heterogeneous cell populations remains challenging. Currently, most existing single-cell data analyses focus on cell type clusters defined by unsupervised clustering methods, which cannot directly link cell clusters with specific biological and clinical phenotypes. Here we present Scissor, a novel approach that utilizes disease phenotypes to identify cell subpopulations from single-cell data that most highly correlate with a given phenotype. This \"phenotype-to-cell within a single step\" strategy enables the utilization of a large amount of clinical information that has been collected for bulk assays to identify the most highly phenotype-associated cell subpopulations. When applied to a lung cancer single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) dataset, Scissor identified a subset of cells exhibiting high hypoxia activities, which predicted worse survival outcomes in lung cancer patients. Furthermore, in a melanoma scRNA-seq dataset, Scissor discerned a T cell subpopulation with low PDCD1/CTLA4 and high TCF7 expressions, which is associated with a favorable immunotherapy response. Thus, Scissor provides a novel framework to identify the biologically and clinically relevant cell subpopulations from single-cell assays by leveraging the wealth of phenotypes and bulk-omics datasets.",

Using the mouse tyrosinase (Tyr) locus as an experimental model, a gene whose mutations are associated with albinism, we described the chromatin structure in cells at two distinct transcriptional states. Guided by chromatin structure, through the use of Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C), we identified sequences at the 5 and 3 boundaries of this mammalian gene that function as enhancers and insulators. By CRISPR/Cas9-mediated chromosomal deletion, we dissected the functions of these two regulatory elements in vivo in the mouse, at the endogenous chromosomal context, and proved their role as genomic insulators, shielding the Tyr locus from the expression patterns of adjacent genes.",

Historical and recent histopathological literature demonstrate cerebellar AD pathology while functional investigation has demonstrated disrupted intrinsic cortical - cerebellar connectivity in AD. Additionally, olfactory deficits occur early in AD, prior to the onset of clinical symptoms. The neurological basis for the involvement of the cerebellum and olfactory system in the disease course remain unclear. 18F-fludeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) data from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were analyzed to characterize metabolism in the cerebellum and olfactory region of AD, mild-cognitive impaired (MCI), and age-matched cognitively normal (CN) controls. In contrast to known parietal and temporal lobe FDG hypo-metabolism within the default mode network in AD, a significant FDG hyper-metabolism was found in the cerebellum and olfactory cortical regions (including the piriform cortex, olfactory tubercle, anterior olfactory nucleus, and nucleus accumbens shell). The increase in cerebellum glucose utilization was shown also in late- verses early-MCI patients. The cerebellar and olfactory regions both contain inhibitory distal and inter-neuronal connections that are vulnerable to disruption in AD. The hyper-metabolism in the cerebellum and olfactory structures may reflect disruption of local and system-wide inhibitory networks due to AD neurodegeneration, suggesting a hypothetical mechanism for susceptibility of the olfactory system to early AD pathology.",

However, the mechanisms enabling the SGNs to cover specific fractions of the audible intensity range remain elusive.

We studied the transfer function of individual active zones (AZs) using dual-color Rhod-FF and iGluSnFR imaging of Ca2+ and glutamate release. AZs differed in the voltage dependence of release: AZs residing at the IHCs pillar (abneural) side activate at more hyperpolarized potentials and typically showed tight control of release by few Ca2+-channels. We conclude that heterogeneity of voltage dependence and release-site coupling of Ca2+-channels among the AZs varies synaptic transfer within individual IHCs and, thereby, likely contributes to the functional diversity of SGNs.",

    "abstract": "Polyketides (PKs) and nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) are two microbial secondary metabolite (SM) families known for their variety of functions, including antimicrobials, siderophores and others. Despite their involvement in bacteria-bacteria and bacteria-plant interactions, root-associated SMs are largely unexplored due to the limited cultivability of bacteria. Here, we analyzed the diversity and expression of SM-encoding biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in root microbiomes by culture-independent amplicon sequencing, shotgun metagenomics and metatranscriptomics. Roots (tomato and lettuce) harbored distinct compositions of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and polyketide synthases (PKSs) relative to the adjacent bulk soil, and specific BGC markers were both enriched and highly expressed in the root microbiomes. While several of the highly abundant and expressed sequences were remotely associated with known BGCs, the low similarity to characterized genes suggests their potential novelty. Low similarity genes were screened against a large set of soil-derived cosmid libraries, from which five whole BGCs of unknown function were retrieved. Three clusters were taxonomically affiliated with Actinobacteria, while the remaining were not associated with known bacteria. One Streptomyces-derived BGC was predicted to encode for a polyene with potential antifungal activity, while the others were too novel to predict chemical structure. Screening against a suite of metagenomic datasets revealed a higher abundance of retrieved clusters in roots and soil samples. In contrast, they were almost completely absent in aquatic and gut environments, supporting the notion that they might play an important role in root ecosystems. Overall, our results indicate that root microbiomes harbor a specific assemblage of undiscovered SMs.\n\nImportanceWe identified distinct secondary metabolite (polyketide and nonribosomal peptide) encoding genes that are enriched (relative to adjacent bulk soil) and expressed in root ecosystems, yet almost completely absent in human gut and aquatic environments. Several of the genes were distantly related to genes encoding for antimicrobials and siderophores, and their high sequence variability relative to known sequences suggests that they may encode for novel metabolites and may have unique ecological functions. This study demonstrates that plant roots harbor a diverse array of unique secondary metabolite encoding genes that are highly enriched and expressed in the root ecosystem. The secondary metabolites encoded by these genes might assist the bacteria that produce them in colonization and persistence in the root environment. To explore this hypothesis, future investigations should assess their potential role in inter-bacterial and bacterial-plant interactions.",

    "abstract": "Mosquito-transmitted flaviviruses, such as Dengue virus (DENV) or Zika virus (ZIKV), are responsible for significant economic damage and human misery. In infected cells, flaviviruses first assemble into an immature form within the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER), and then undergo further processing by furin protease in the trans-Golgi. Despite substantial efforts, previous cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies of immature flaviviruses were restricted to low to medium resolutions, limiting our understanding of maturation. To better grasp the process of maturation, we have carried out cryo-EM reconstructions of immature Spondweni virus (SPOV), an emerging human flavivirus belonging to the same serogroup as ZIKV (~75% amino acid identity). By combining localized reconstruction and focused refinement, we were able to improve the resolution to 3.8 [A], yielding unprecedented insight into the immature form. The structure elucidates how, at neutral pH, polar interactions conceal the furin recognition site within trimeric envelope (E) protein spikes. Furthermore, we identify how a strictly conserved pH sensor anchors the precursor membrane (prM) protein to immature E. We reconstructed mature forms of SPONV and DENV to 2.6[A] and 3.1[A], respectively. Comparison with immature virus shows a conserved binding pocket for a lipid headgroup, which forms as a consequence of the rearrangement of amphipathic stem-helices of E. We propose a structural role for the pocket and suggest it stabilizes mature E. Taken together, our data suggest a compelling rationale for low-pH triggered conformational rearrangement in the Golgi, which occurs during flavivirus maturation.",

    "abstract": "In mammals, spinal cord injuries often result in muscle paralysis through the apoptosis of lower motor neurons and denervation of neuromuscular junctions. Previous research shows that the inflammatory response to a spinal cord injury can cause additional tissue damage after the initial trauma. To modulate this inflammatory response, we delivered lentiviral anti-inflammatory interleukin-10, via loading onto an implantable biomaterial scaffold, into a left-sided hemisection at the C5 vertebra in mice. We hypothesized that improved behavioral outcomes associated with anti-inflammatory treatment are due to the sparing of fine motor circuit components. We examined behavioral recovery using a ladder beam, lower motor neuron apoptosis and muscle innervation using histology, and electromyogram recordings using intraspinal optogenetic stimulation at 2 weeks post-injury. Ladder beam analysis shows interleukin-10 treatment results in significant improvement of behavioral recovery at 2 and 12 weeks post-injury when compared to mice treated with a control virus. Histology shows interleukin-10 results in greater numbers of lower motor neurons and muscle innervation at 2 weeks post-injury. Furthermore, electromyogram recordings suggest that interleukin-10-treated animals have signal-to-noise ratios and peak-to-peak amplitudes more similar to that of uninjured controls than to that of control injured animals at 2 weeks post-injury. These data show that gene therapy using anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 can significantly reduce lower motor neuron loss, muscle denervation, and subsequent motor deficits after a spinal cord injury. Together, these results suggest that early modulation of the injury response can preserve muscle function with long-lasting benefits.",
