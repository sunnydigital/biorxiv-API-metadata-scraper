    "abstract": "N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of RNA plays important roles in normal and cancer biology, but knowledge of its function on long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) remains limited. Here, we investigate whether m6A regulates the function of the human HOTAIR lncRNA, which contributes to multiple pro-tumor phenotypes in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. We identify at least 8 individual m6A sites within HOTAIR, with a single site (A783) consistently methylated. Mutation of A783 impairs cellular proliferation and invasion in HOTAIR-overexpressing TNBC cells. m6A at A783 regulates HOTAIRs ability to localize to chromatin and induce gene pathways that affect tumor progression. In contrast, A783U mutant HOTAIR demonstrates loss-of-function and antimorph behaviors by impairing gene expression changes induced by WT HOTAIR and, in some cases, inducing opposite changes in gene expression. HOTAIR interacts with nuclear m6A reader YTHDC1 and high HOTAIR is significantly associated with shorter overall patient survival, particularly in the context of high YTHDC1. At the molecular level, YTHDC1-HOTAIR interactions are required for chromatin localization and regulation of gene repression. Our work demonstrates how modification of one base in a lncRNA can elicit a distinct gene regulation mechanism and drive disease-associated phenotypic changes such as proliferation and invasion.",

    "abstract": "Diverse subpopulations of mechanosensory neurons detect different mechanical forces and influence behavior. How these subpopulations connect with central circuits to influence behavior remains an important area of study. We previously discovered a neural circuit that elicits grooming of the Drosophila melanogaster antennae that is activated by an antennal mechanosensory chordotonal organ, the Johnstons organ (JO) (Hampel et al., 2015). Here, we describe anatomically and physiologically distinct JO mechanosensory neuron subpopulations and define how they interface with the circuit that elicits antennal grooming. We show that the subpopulations project to distinct zones in the brain and differ in their responses to mechanical stimulation of the antennae. Each subpopulation elicits grooming through direct synaptic connections with a single interneuron in the circuit, the dendrites of which span the different mechanosensory afferent projection zones. Thus, distinct JO subpopulations converge onto the same neural circuit to elicit a common behavioral response.",

    "abstract": "We derive an approximate closed-form solution to the chemical master equation describing the Michaelis-Menten reaction mechanism of enzyme action. In particular, assuming that the probability of a complex dissociating into enzyme and substrate is significantly larger than the probability of a product formation event, we obtain expressions for the time-dependent marginal probability distributions of the number of substrate and enzyme molecules. For delta function initial conditions, we show that the substrate distribution is either unimodal at all times or else becomes bimodal at intermediate times. This transient bimodality, which has no deterministic counterpart, manifests when the initial number of substrate molecules is much larger than the total number of enzyme molecules and if the frequency of enzyme-substrate binding events is large enough. Furthermore, we show that our closed-form solution is different from the solution of the chemical master equation reduced by means of the widely used discrete stochastic Michaelis-Menten approximation, where the propensity for substrate decay has a hyperbolic dependence on the number of substrate molecules. The differences arise because the latter does not take into account enzyme number fluctuations while our approach includes them. We confirm by means of stochastic simulation of all the elementary reaction steps in the Michaelis-Menten mechanism that our closed-form solution is accurate over a larger region of parameter space than that obtained using the discrete stochastic Michaelis-Menten approximation.",

    "abstract": "Flapping insect wings deform during flight. This deformation benefits the insects aerodynamic force production as well as energetic efficiency. However, it is challenging to measure wing displacement field in flying insects. Many points must be tracked over the wings surface to resolve its instantaneous shape. To reduce the number of points one is required to track, we propose a physics-based reconstruction method called System Equivalent Reduction Expansion Processes (SEREP) to estimate wing deformation and strain from sparse measurements. Measurement locations are determined using a Weighted Normalized Modal Displacement (NMD) method. We experimentally validate the reconstruction technique by flapping a paper wing from 5-9 Hz with 45{degrees} and measuring strain at three locations. Two measurements are used for the reconstruction and the third for validation. Strain reconstructions had a maximal error of 30% in amplitude. We extend this methodology to a more realistic insect wing through numerical simulation. We show that wing displacement can be estimated from sparse displacement or strain measurements, and that additional sensors spatially average measurement noise to improve reconstruction accuracy. This research helps overcome some of the challenges of measuring full-field dynamics in flying insects and provides a framework for strain-based sensing in insect-inspired flapping robots.",

However, the noisy and high-dimensional nature of the generated data poses significant challenges for its analysis and integration. Here, I describe Monet, an open-source Python package designed to provide effective and computationally efficient solutions to some of the most common challenges encountered in scRNA-Seq data analysis, and to serve as a toolkit for scRNA-Seq method development. At its core, Monet implements algorithms to infer the dimensionality and construct a PCA-based latent space from a given dataset. This latent space, represented by a MonetModel object, then forms the basis for data analysis and integration. In addition to validating these core algorithms, I provide demonstrations of some more advanced analysis tasks currently supported, such as batch correction and label transfer, which are useful for analyzing multiple datasets from the same tissue. Monet is available at https://github.com/flo-compbio/monet. Ongoing work is focused on providing electronic notebooks with tutorials for individual analysis tasks, and on developing interoperability with other Python scRNA-Seq software.

While primary cilia are necessary to initiate Hedgehog (HH)-driven cancers, how HH pathway activity is maintained in advanced cancers devoid of primary cilia is unclear. Here, we find that HH-driven basal cell carcinoma (BCC) accumulates mutations in Alstrom and Usher syndrome genes. Loss of Alstrom and Usher syndrome gene expression, which are common underlying causes of deafness and blindness, suppresses primary ciliogenesis and HH signaling but enhances expression of atypical protein kinase C iota/lambda (aPKC), a GLI1 kinase necessary for advanced BCC growth. We show that aPKC expression is inversely correlated with primary ciliogenesis and that superficial BCCs display less primary cilia and higher aPKC expression, with the opposite trend in nodular BCC subtypes. Surprisingly, a constitutively active isoform of aPKC but not full-length protein drives HH pathway activity. Overexpression of the constitutively active aPKC variant can maintain HH pathway activity and tumor growth in the absence of primary cilia. Our results suggest tumors enhance isoform-specific expression of aPKC to prevent mutation-induced cessation of tumor growth.",

    "abstract": "The right and left ventricle of the heart have distinctly different developmental origins and are affected differently by similar pathological stimuli. Though it is well established that the heart relies almost entirely on mitochondrial function to sustain energy production, it remains unclear whether bioenergetics differ in the two ventricles. Herein, we define a novel methodology to optimize the isolation of intact cardiomyocytes from the right versus the left ventricle. We demonstrate that this segmental Langendorff-free methodology yields viable cardiomyocytes with intact mitochondrial function. Further, we compare bioenergetics in right versus left ventricle cardiomyocytes and show that cardiomyocytes from the right ventricle have a greater maximal capacity for respiration and enhanced glycolytic rate. This increase in respiration was concomitant with increased fatty acid oxidation and levels of fatty acid oxidation proteins, but no change in mitochondrial electron transport complex expression. These data validate a potentially powerful tool to evaluate differences in right and left ventricular function and advance the understanding of cardiac bioenergetic differences. These data will be discussed in the context of differential responses by the right versus ventricle in pathology.",

    "abstract": "CREB-dependent transcription necessary for long-term memory is driven by interactions with CREB-binding protein (CBP), a multi-domain protein that binds numerous transcription factors. Identifying specific domain functions for multi-action proteins is essential to understand processes necessary for healthy living including cognitive function and a robust circadian clock. We investigated the function of the CBP KIX domain in hippocampal memory and gene expression using CBPKIX/KIX mice with mutations that prevent phospho-CREB (Ser133) binding. We found that CBPKIX/KIX mice were impaired in long-term, but not short-term spatial memory in the Morris water maze. Using an unbiased analysis of gene expression after training for hippocampus-dependent memory, we discovered dysregulation of CREB and CLOCK target genes and downregulation of circadian genes in CBPKIX/KIX mice. With our finding that the CBP KIX domain was important for transcription of circadian genes, we profiled circadian activity in CBPKIX/KIX mice. CBPKIX/KIX mice exhibited delayed activity peaks after light offset and longer free-running periods in constant dark, although phase resetting to light was comparable to wildtype. These studies provide insight into the significance of the CBP KIX domain by defining targets of CBP transcriptional co-activation in memory and the role of the CBP KIX domain in vivo on circadian rhythms.",

Recent evidence points to the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) as a crucial semantic hub integrating both abstract and concrete conceptual features according to a dorsal-to-medial gradient. It is however unclear when this conceptual gradient emerges and how semantic information reaches the ATL during conceptual retrieval. Here we used a multiple regression approach to magnetoencephalography signals of spoken words, combined with dimensionality reduction in concrete and abstract semantic feature spaces. Results showed that the dorsal-to-medial abstract-to-concrete ATL gradient emerges only in late stages of word processing: Abstract and concrete semantic information are initially encoded in posterior temporal regions and travel along separate cortical pathways eventually converging in the ATL. The present finding sheds light on the neural dynamics of conceptual processing that shape the organization of knowledge in the anterior temporal lobe.",

    "abstract": "Dbh is a Y-family translesion DNA polymerase from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, an archaeal species that grows in harsh environmental conditions. Biochemically, Dbh displays a distinctive mutational profile, creating single-base deletion mutations at extraordinarily high frequencies (up to 50%) in specific repeat sequences. In cells, however, Dbh does not appear to contribute significantly to spontaneous frameshifts in these same sequence contexts. This suggests that either the error-prone DNA synthesis activity of Dbh is reduced in vivo and/or Dbh is restricted from replicating these sequences. Here, we test the hypothesis that the propensity for Dbh to make single base deletion mutations is reduced through interaction with the S. acidocaldarius heterotrimeric sliding clamp processivity factor, PCNA-123. We first confirm that Dbh physically interacts with PCNA-123, with the interaction requiring both the PCNA-1 subunit and the C-terminal 10 amino acids of Dbh, which contain a predicted PCNA-interaction peptide (PIP) motif. This interaction stimulates the polymerase activity of Dbh, even on short, linear primer-template DNA by increasing the rate of nucleotide incorporation. This stimulation requires an intact PCNA-123 heterotrimer and a DNA duplex length of at least 18 basepairs, the minimal length predicted from structural data to bind to both the polymerase and the clamp. Finally, we find that PCNA-123 increases the fidelity of Dbh on a single-base deletion hotspot sequence 3-fold by promoting an increase in the rate of correct, but not incorrect, nucleotide addition and propose that PCNA-123 induces Dbh to adopt a more active conformation that is less prone to creating deletions during DNA synthesis.\n\nHighlightsO_LIPCNA increases the fidelity of Dbh polymerase on a deletion-hotspot sequence.\nC_LIO_LIThe interaction stimulates incorporation of the correct, but not incorrect, nucleotide.\nC_LIO_LIA minimal duplex length of 18 bp is required for PCNA to stimulate polymerase activity.\nC_LIO_LIStructural modeling suggests that PCNA induces a conformational change in Dbh.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Efficient mechanisms of lipid transport are indispensable for the Plasmodium malaria parasite along the different stages of its intracellular life-cycle. Gene targeting approaches have recently revealed the irreplaceable role of the Plasmodium-encoded type 4 P-type ATPases (P4-ATPases or lipid flippases), ATP2, together with its potential involvement as antimalarial drug target. In eukaryotic membranes, P4-ATPases assure their asymmetric phospholipid distribution by translocating phospholipids from the outer to the inner leaflet. As ATP2 is a yet putative transporter, in this work we have used a recombinantly-produced P. chabaudi ATP2, PcATP2, to gain insights into the function and structural organization of this essential transporter. Our work demonstrates that PcATP2 heterodimerizes with two of the three Plasmodium-encoded Cdc50 proteins: PcCdc50B and PcCdc50A, indispensable partners for most P4-ATPases. Moreover, the purified PcATP2/PcCdc50B complex catalyses ATP hydrolysis in the presence of phospholipids containing either phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine or phosphatidylcholine head groups, and that this activity is upregulated by phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate. Overall, our work provides the first study of the function and quaternary organization of ATP2, a promising antimalarial drug target candidate.",

The utilization of machine learning methods has helped to extract relevant information from various biological datasets. However, there are still several obstacles that motivate new algorithms and pipeline proposals, mainly involving feature extraction problems, in which extracting significant discriminatory information from a biological set is challenging. Considering this, our work proposes to study and analyze a feature extraction pipeline based on mathematical models (Numerical Mapping, Fourier, Entropy, and Complex Networks). As a case study, we analyze Long Non-Coding RNA sequences. Moreover, we divided this work into two studies, e.g., (I) we assessed our proposal with the most addressed problem in our review, e.g., lncRNA vs. mRNA; (II) we tested its generalization on different classification problems, e.g., circRNA vs. lncRNA. The experimental results demonstrated three main contributions: (1) An in-depth study of several mathematical models; (2) a new feature extraction pipeline and (3) its generalization and robustness for distinct biological sequence classification.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMedulloblastoma (MB) is an aggressive brain tumor that predominantly affects children. Recent high-throughput sequencing studies suggest that the non-coding RNA genome, in particular long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), contributes to MB sub-grouping. Here we report the identification of a novel lncRNA, lnc-HLX-2-7, as a potential molecular marker and therapeutic target in group 3 MBs.\n\nMethodsPublicly available RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from 175 MB patients were interrogated to identify lncRNAs that differentiate between MB subgroups. After characterizing a subset of differentially expressed lncRNAs in vitro and in vivo, the group 3-enriched lncRNA lnc-HLX2-7 was deleted by CRISPR/Cas9 in the MB cell line D425 Med. Intracranially injected tumors were further characterized by bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing.\n\nResultslnc-HLX-2-7 is highly upregulated in group 3 MB cell lines, patient-derived xenografts, and primary MBs compared to other MB sub-groups as assessed by qRT-PCR, RNA-seq, and RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Depletion of lnc-HLX-2-7 with antisense oligonucleotides or CRISPR/Cas9 significantly reduced cell proliferation and 3D colony formation and induced apoptosis. lnc-HLX-2-7-deleted D425 Med cells injected into mouse cerebella produced smaller tumors than those derived from parental cells. Pathway analysis revealed that lnc-HLX2-7 modulated oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and sirtuin signaling pathways. The MYC oncogene regulated lnc-HLX-2-7, and the small molecule BET-bromodomain (BRD4) inhibitor JQ1 reduced lnc-HLX2-7 expression.\n\nConclusionslnc-HLX-2-7 is oncogenic in MB and represents a promising novel molecular marker and a potential therapeutic target in group 3 MBs in children.\n\nKey pointsO_LIlnc-HLX-2-7 is highly upregulated in group 3 medulloblastomas compared to other sub-groups.\nC_LIO_LIIn vitro and in vivo studies strongly support an oncogenic role for lnc-HLX2-7 in group 3 medulloblastoma.\nC_LIO_LIlnc-HLX-2-7 may be a novel biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in group 3 medulloblastoma.\nC_LI\n\nImportance of the studyGroup 3 medulloblastomas are associated with poor clinical outcomes, are difficult to subtype clinically, and their biology is poorly understood. In an effort to address these problems, we identified a group 3-specific long non-coding RNA, lnc-HLX-2-7, in an in silico analysis of 175 medulloblastomas and confirmed its expression in group 3 medulloblastoma cell lines, patient-derived xenografts, and FFPE samples. CRISPR/Cas9 deletion and antisense oligonucleotide knockdown of lnc-HLX-2-7 significantly reduced cell growth and 3D colony formation and induced apoptosis. Deletion of lnc-HLX-2-7 in cells injected into mouse cerebellums reduced tumor growth compared to parental cells, and RNA sequencing of these tumors revealed lnc-HLX-2-7-associated modulation of cell viability and cell death signaling pathways. The oncogene MYC regulates lnc-HLX-2-7, and its expression can be controlled by the BET-bromodomain (BRD4) inhibitor JQ1. lnc-HLX-2-7 is a candidate biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in group 3 medulloblastomas in children.",

    "abstract": "Across the Tree of Life (ToL), the complexity of proteomes varies widely. Our systematic analysis depicts that from the simplest archaea to mammals, the total number of proteins per proteome expanded ~200-fold. Individual proteins also became larger, and multi-domain proteins expanded ~50-fold. Apart from duplication and divergence of existing proteins, completely new proteins were born. Along the ToL, the number of different folds expanded ~5-fold and fold-combinations ~20-fold. Proteins prone to misfolding and aggregation, such as repeat and beta-rich proteins, proliferated ~600-fold, and accordingly, proteins predicted as aggregation-prone became 6-fold more frequent in mammalian compared to bacterial proteomes. To control the quality of these expanding proteomes, core-chaperones, ranging from HSP20s that prevent aggregation to HSP60, HSP70, HSP90, and HSP100 acting as ATP-fueled unfolding and refolding machines, also evolved. However, these core-chaperones were already available in prokaryotes, and they comprise ~0.3% of all genes from archaea to mammals. This challenge--roughly the same number of core-chaperones supporting a massive expansion of proteomes, was met by (i) higher cellular abundances of the ancient generalist core-chaperones, and (ii) continuous emergence of new substrate-binding and nucleotide-exchange factor co-chaperones that function cooperatively with core-chaperones, as a network.",

    "abstract": "Aerobic glycolysis, or preferential fermentation of glucose-derived pyruvate to lactate despite available oxygen, is a hallmark of proliferative metabolism that is observed across many organisms and conditions. To better understand why aerobic glycolysis is associated with cell proliferation, we examined the metabolic consequence of activating the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) to increase mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation at the expense of fermentation. We find that increasing PDH activity impairs cell proliferation by reducing the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide cofactor ratio (NAD+/NADH). This change in NAD+/NADH ratio is caused by an increase in mitochondrial membrane potential that impairs mitochondrial electron transport and NAD+ regeneration. Uncoupling mitochondrial respiration from ATP synthesis or increasing ATP hydrolysis restores NAD+/NADH homeostasis and proliferation even when glucose oxidation is increased. These data suggest that when the demand for NAD+ to support oxidation reactions exceeds the demand for ATP consumption in cells, NAD+ regeneration by mitochondrial respiration becomes constrained, promoting fermentation despite available oxygen. This argues that cells engage in aerobic glycolysis when the cellular demand for NAD+ is in excess of the cellular demand for ATP.",

    "abstract": "Chaperones are essential for assisting protein folding, and for transferring poorly soluble proteins to their functional locations within cells. Hydrophobic interactions drive promiscuous chaperone-client binding, but our understanding how additional interactions enable client specificity is sparse. Here we decipher what determines binding of two chaperones (TIM8{middle dot}13, TIM9{middle dot}10) to different integral membrane proteins, the alltransmembrane mitochondrial carrier Ggc1, and Tim23 which has an additional disordered hydrophilic domain. Combining NMR, SAXS and molecular dynamics simulations, we determine the structures of Tim23/TIM8{middle dot}13 and Tim23/TIM9{middle dot}10 complexes. TIM8{middle dot}13 uses transient salt bridges to interact with the hydrophilic part of its client, but its interactions to the trans-membrane part are weaker than in TIM9{middle dot}10. Consequently, TIM9{middle dot}10 is outcompeting TIM8{middle dot}13 in binding hydrophobic clients, while TIM8{middle dot}13 is tuned to few clients with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts. Our study exemplifies how chaperones fine-tune the balance of promiscuity vs. specificity.",

    "abstract": "The shuttling of transcription factors and transcriptional regulators in and out of the nucleus is central to the regulation of many biological processes. Here we describe a new method for studying the rates of nuclear entry and exit of transcriptional regulators. A photo-responsive AsLOV (Avena sativa Light Oxygen Voltage) domain is used to sequester fluorescently-labelled transcriptional regulators YAP1 and TAZ/WWTR1 on the surface of mitochondria and reversibly release them upon blue light illumination. After dissociation, fluorescent signals from mitochondria, cytoplasm and nucleus are extracted with a bespoke app and used to generate rates of nuclear entry and exit. Using this method, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of YAP1 on canonical sites enhances its rate of nuclear export. Moreover, we provide evidences that, despite high intercellular variability, YAP1 import and export rates correlated within the same cell. By simultaneously releasing YAP1 and TAZ from sequestration, we show that their rates of entry and exit are correlated. Furthermore, tracking of light-sensitive YAP1 with lattice lightsheet microscopy revealed high heterogeneity of YAP1 dynamics within different subcellular regions, suggesting that implementing high resolution volumetric 3D data could shed light on new mechanisms of nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of proteins.",

With some exceptions, the current tools for assessing gene expression have been designed around the structures of eukaryotic genes. There are a few stand-alone tools designed for prokaryotes, and they require improvement. A well-defined pipeline for prokaryotes that includes all the necessary tools for quality control, determination of differential gene expression, downstream pathway analysis, and normalization of data collected in extreme biological conditions is still lacking.

    "abstract": "Nucleic acid interactions under crowded environments are of great importance for biological processes and nanotechnology. However, the kinetics and thermodynamics of nucleic acid interactions in a crowded environment remain poorly understood. We use a coarse-grained model of DNA to study the kinetics and thermodynamics of DNA duplex and hairpin formation in crowded environments. We find that crowders can increase the melting temperature of both an 8-mer DNA duplex and a hairpin with a stem of 6-nt depending on the excluded volume fraction of crowders in solution and the crowder size. The crowding induced stability originates from the entropic effect caused by the crowding particles in the system. Additionally, we study the hybridization kinetics of DNA duplex formation and the formation of hairpin stems, finding that the reaction rate kon is increased by the crowding effect, while koff is changed only moderately. The increase in kon mostly comes from increasing the probability of reaching a transition state with one base pair formed. A DNA strand displacement reaction in a crowded environment is also studied with the model and we find that rate of toehold association is increased, with possible applications to speeding up strand displacement cascades in nucleic acid nanotechnology.",

    "abstract": "NMDA receptors are excitatory channels with critical functions in the physiology of central synapses. Their activation reaction proceeds as a series of kinetically distinguishable, reversible steps, whose structural bases are of current interest. Very likely, the earliest steps in the activation reaction include glutamate binding to and compression of the ligand-binding domain. Later, three short linkers transduce this movement to open the gate by mechanical coupling with transmembrane helices. Here, we used double-mutant cycle analyses to demonstrate that a direct chemical interaction between GluN1-I642 (on M3) and GluN2A-L550 (on L1-M1) stabilizes receptors after they have opened, and therefore represents one of the structural changes that occur late in the activation reaction. This native interaction extends the current decay, and its absence predicts deficits in charge transfer by GluN1-I642L, a pathogenic human variant.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTNMDA receptors are glutamatergic channels whose activations control the strength of excitatory synapses in the central nervous system. Agonist binding initiates a complex activation reaction that consists of a stepwise sequence of reversible isomerizations. In addition to previously identified steps in this series, which include agonist-induced closure of the ligand-binding lobes, and the subsequent mechanical pulling by the ligand-binding domain on the gate-forming transmembrane helix, we identify a new cross-subunit interaction, which stabilizes open receptors and slows the rate of the current decay. Naturally occurring NMDA receptor variants lacking this interaction are pathogenic.",

    "abstract": "The selection of transcription terminators (TTs) for pairing with high expressing constitutive promoters in chimeric constructs is crucial to deliver optimal transgene expression in plants. In this study, the use of the native combinations of four polyubiquitin gene promoters and corresponding TTs resulted in up to >3-fold increase in transgene expression in maize. Of the eight polyubiquitin promoter and TT regulatory elements utilized, seven were novel and identified from the polyubiquitin genes of Brachypodium distachyon, Setaria italica, and Zea mays. Furthermore, gene expression driven by the Cassava mosaic virus promoter was studied by pairing the promoter with distinct TTs derived from the high expressing genes of Arabidopsis. Of the three TTs studied, the polyubiquitin10 gene TT produced the highest transgene expression in maize. Polyadenylation patterns and mRNA abundance from eight distinct TTs were analyzed using 3-RACE and next-generation sequencing. The results exhibited one to three unique polyadenylation sites in the TTs. The poly(A) site patterns for the StPinII TT were consistent when the same TT was deployed in chimeric constructs irrespective of the reporter gene and promoter used. Distal to the poly(A) sites, putative polyadenylation signals were identified in the near-upstream regions of the TTs based on previously reported mutagenesis and bioinformatics studies in rice and Arabidopsis. The putative polyadenylation signals were 9 to 11 nucleotides in length. Six of the eight TTs contained the putative polyadenylation signals that were overlaps of either canonical AAUAAA or AAUAAA-like polyadenylation signals and AUGAAU, a top-ranking-hexamer of rice and Arabidopsis gene near-upstream regions. Three of the polyubiquitin gene TTs contained the identical 9-nucleotide overlap, AUGAAUAAG, underscoring the functional significance of such overlaps in mRNA 3 end processing. In addition to identifying new combinations of regulatory elements for high constitutive trait gene expression in maize, this study demonstrated the importance of TTs for optimizing gene expression in plants. Learning from this study could be applied to other dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plant species for transgene expression.",

However, little is understood about the underlying demographic mechanisms shaping population response following these extreme disturbances. Here, we analyze 45 years of the most comprehensive free-ranging nonhuman primate demographic dataset to determine the effects of major hurricanes on the variability and maintenance of long-term population fitness. For this, we use individual-level data to build matrix population models and perform perturbation analyses. Despite reductions in population growth rate mediated through reduced fertility, our study reveals a demographic buffering during hurricane years. As long as survival does not decrease, our study shows that hurricanes do not result in detrimental effects at the population level, demonstrating the unbalanced contribution of survival and fertility to population fitness in long-lived animal populations.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis that is distinctly characterized by granuloma formation within infected tissues. Granulomas are dynamic and organized immune cell aggregates that limit dissemination, but can also hinder bacterial clearance. Consequently, outcome in TB is influenced by how granuloma structure and composition shift the balance between these two functions. To date, our understanding of what factors drive granuloma function in humans is limited. With this in mind, we used Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging by Time-of-Flight (MIBI-TOF) to profile 37 proteins in tissues from thirteen patients with active TB disease from the U.S. and South Africa. With this dataset, we constructed a comprehensive tissue atlas where the lineage, functional state, and spatial distribution of 19 unique cell subsets were mapped onto eight phenotypically-distinct granuloma microenvironments. This work revealed an immunosuppressed microenvironment specific to TB granulomas with spatially coordinated co-expression of IDO1 and PD-L1 by myeloid cells and proliferating regulatory T cells. Interestingly, this microenvironment lacked markers consistent with T-cell activation, supporting a myeloid-mediated mechanism of immune suppression. We observed similar trends in gene expression of immunoregulatory proteins in a confirmatory transcriptomic analysis of peripheral blood collected from over 1500 individuals with latent or active TB infection and healthy controls across 29 cohorts spanning 14 countries. Notably, PD-L1 gene expression was found to correlate with TB progression and treatment response, supporting its potential use as a blood-based biomarker. Taken together, this study serves as a framework for leveraging independent cohorts and complementary methodologies to understand how local and systemic immune responses are linked in human health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Misfolded -synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies, which are a hallmark of Parkinsons disease. A large body of evidence shows that -synuclein can self-assemble into amyloid fibrils, but the relationship between amyloid formation and Lewy body formation still remains unclear. Here we show, both in vitro and in a C. elegans model of Parkinsons disease, that -synuclein undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation by forming a liquid droplet state, which converts into an amyloid-rich hydrogel. This maturation process towards the amyloid state is delayed in the presence of model synaptic vesicles in vitro. Taken together, these results suggest that the formation of Lewy bodies is linked to the arrested maturation of -synuclein condensates in the presence of lipids and other cellular components.",

Specifically, we develop a deep learning neural network with a score-based ensembling scheme for flexible function approximation. An improved semiparametric procedure is further developed to enhance the performance of the proposed method under finite sample settings. Comprehensive numerical studies have demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed methods as compared with existing methods, with a remarkably reduced bias and mean squared error in parameter estimates. The proposed research is motivated by a post-surgery pain study, which is also used to illustrate the practical application of deepTL.

    "abstract": "Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the world. Recent advances in acute stroke care have dramatically improved clinicians abilities to reperfuse occluded blood vessels. With these advances, the importance of adjunctive therapies to supplement or complement reperfusion therapy is receiving greater interest. Cerebral collateral circulation is one of such area that is now gaining greater interest in acute stroke care. In this study, we investigate the use of peripheral electrical stimulation to induce functional hyperemia in a mouse animal model in the setting of acute stroke. Using a laser speckle contrast imaging system, we evaluated the use of peripheral electrical stimulation at 1 hour and 3 hours after stroke induction. Results demonstrated that stimulation initiated 1 hour following stroke significantly increase collateral cerebral blood flow, while stimulation at 3 hours after stroke had no appreciable effect. These results suggest that augmentation cerebral collateral circulation may be possible in the setting of acute stroke although there may be a critical time window in which this would have to be initiated.",

    "abstract": "Cell lineage in the adult hippocampus comprises multipotent and neuron-committed progenitors. In the present work, we fate-mapped neuronal progenitors using Dcx-CreERT2 and CAG-CAT-EGFP double-transgenic mice (cDCX/EGFP). We show that three days after tamoxifen-mediated recombination in cDCX/EGFP adult mice, GFP+ cells in the dentate gyrus co-expresses DCX and about 6% of these cells are proliferative neuronal progenitors. After 30 days, 20% of GFP+ generated from these progenitors differentiate into GFAP+ astrocytes. Administration of the chemoconvulsants kainic acid (KA) or pilocarpine (PL) led to a significant increase in the number of GFP+ cells in both ipsi and contralateral dentate gyrus. However, while PL favored the differentiation of neurons in both ipsi- and contralateral sides, KA stimulated neurogenesis only in the contralateral side. In the ipsilateral side, KA injection led to an unexpected increase of astrogliogenesis in the Dcx-lineage. These different effects of KA and PL in the Dcx-lineage are associated with distinct alterations of the parvalbuminergic plexus and inflammatory responses in the hippocampi. Finally, we also observed a small number of GFP+/GFAP+ cells displaying radial-glia morphology ipsilaterally 3 days after KA administration, indicating that Dcx-progenitors could regress to a multipotent stage. Altogether, our data suggest that cell lineage in the adult hippocampus is not unidirectional and can be modulated by environmental signals.",

The current study evaluated the effect of organic zinc supplementation in hens on fertility after insemination with cryopreserved semen. White Leghorn rooster semen was cryopreserved using 4% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) in 0.5ml French straws. Different semen parameters and fertility were assessed in post-thaw samples. White Leghorn hens were divided into 5 groups with 30 birds in each group. Each group was further divided into six replicates of five birds each. The control group was fed basal diet, other groups were fed with basal diet supplemented with 40, 60, 120 and 160 mg/kg organic zinc (zinc proteinate). After two weeks of feeding insemination was done in hens per vagina using thawed semen (200 million sperm/0.1 ml). Basal group hens were inseminated with fresh or cryopreserved semen and served as control groups. Sperm motility, live sperm, and acrosome intact sperm parameters were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) lower in post-thaw semen samples. Fertility from cryopreserved semen was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) lower and organic zinc supplemented hens had fertility similar to that of cryopreserved semen inseminated into basal diet group hens. In conclusion, organic zinc supplementation in hens does not improve fertility after insemination with 4% DMSO cryopreserved semen.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The maintenance of intracellular processes like organelle transport and cell division depend on bidirectional movement along microtubules. These processes typically require kinesin and dynein motor proteins which move with opposite directionality. Because both types of motors are often simultaneously bound to the cargo, regulatory mechanisms are required to ensure controlled directional transport. Recently, it has been shown that parameters like mechanical motor activation, ATP concentration and roadblocks on the microtubule surface differentially influence the activity of kinesin and dynein motors in distinct manners. However, how these parameters affect bidirectional transport systems has not been studied. Here, we investigate the regulatory influence of these three parameter using in vitro gliding motility assays and stochastic simulations. We find that the number of active kinesin and dynein motors determines the transport direction and velocity, but that variations in ATP concentration and roadblock density have no significant effect. Thus, factors influencing the force balance between opposite motors appear to be important, whereas the detailed stepping kinetics and bypassing capabilities of the motors have only little effect.",

    "abstract": "Understanding a complex microbial ecosystem such as the human gut microbiome requires information about both microbial species and the metabolites they produce and secrete. These metabolites are exchanged via a large network of cross-feeding interactions, and are crucial for predicting the functional state of the microbiome. However, till date, we only have information for a part of this network, limited by experimental throughput. Here, we propose an ecology-based computational method, GutCP, using which we predict hundreds of new experimentally untested cross-feeding interactions in the human gut microbiome. GutCP utilizes a mechanistic model of the gut microbiome with the explicit exchange of metabolites and their effects on the growth of microbial species. To build GutCP, we combined metagenomic and metabolomic measurements from the gut microbiome with optimization techniques from machine learning. Close to 65% of the cross-feeding interactions predicted by GutCP are supported by evidence from genome annotation; we provide these predictions for experimentally testing. Our method has the potential to greatly improve existing models of the human gut microbiome, as well as our ability to predict the metabolic profile of the gut.",

It optimizes decision-making in personalized breast cancer therapy by connecting tumor growth behaviour and chemotherapy effects through predictive modelling and learning. We demonstrate the capabilities of CHIMERA in learning simultaneously the tumor growth patterns, across several types of breast cancer, and the pharmacokinetics of a typical breast cancer chemotoxic drug.

    "abstract": "In human opposite-sex twins, certain phenotypic traits of the female are affected negatively by testosterone transfer from the male, while the male may or may not be affected by the female in utero. However, no study was carried out to uncover the epigenetic basis of these effects. Here, we generated DNA methylation data from 54 newborn twins and histone modification data from 14 newborn twins, including female-female (FF), female-male (FM), and male-male (MM) newborn twins, to exclude the effects of postnatal environment and socialization, and investigated the epigenetic consequences of prenatal interactions between female and male gonadal hormones. We found that FM-Fs (female in FM twins) were distinguishable from FF twins by their DNA methylome, as were FM-Ms (male in FM twins) from MM twins. The correlation between genome-wide DNA methylation of females and males showed that FM-Fs, but not FFs, were closer to males from FM-Ms and MMs. Interestingly, the DNA methylomic differences between FM-Fs and FFs, but not those between FM-Ms and MMs, were linked to cognition and the nervous system. Meanwhile, FM-Ms and MMs, but not FM-Fs and FFs, displayed differential histone modification of H3K4me3, which were linked to immune responses. These findings provide epigenetic evidence for the twin testosterone transfer hypothesis and explain how prenatal hormone exposure is linked to reported and novel traits of childhood and adult through the epigenome in opposite-sex twins.\n\nAuthor SummaryPrenatal exposure to testosterone may affect physiological, cognitive, and behavioral traits in females with male co-twins, while the males in opposite-sex twins present weak and inconsistent influences. In this study, we systematically investigated the hormonal interactions between opposite-sex twins in newborns from epigenetics including DNA methylation and histone modifications. We show that DNA methylome in FM-Fs (female in FM twins) was different from FF twins and their DNA methylomic differences were associated with cognition and the nervous system. We also suggest that FM-Ms (male in FM twins) were distinguishable from MM twins by their DNA methylome and FM-Ms versus MMs displayed differential histone modification of H3K4me3, which were linked to immune responses. Our study provides insight into the epigenetic explanation for hormonal influences between opposite-sex fetuses.",

However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, and long-term interacting effects of different drivers are largely unknown due to the short-term nature of the studies conducted so far.\nC_LIO_LIWe addressed this gap and successfully parameterized a process-based model for the biocrust-forming lichen Diploschistes diacapsis as a common and globally distributed representative of biocrust communities to quantify how changing atmospheric CO2, temperature, rainfall amount and relative humidity affect its photosynthetic activity and cover. We also mimicked a long-term manipulative climate change experiment to understand the mechanisms underlying observed patterns in the field.\nC_LIO_LIThe model reproduced observed experimental findings: warming reduced lichen cover whereas less rainfall had no effect. This warming effect was caused by the associated decrease in relative humidity and non-rainfall water inputs as major water sources for lichens. Warming alone, however, increased cover because higher temperatures promoted photosynthesis during the cool morning hours with high lichen activity. When combined, climate variables showed non-additive effects on lichen cover, and fertilization effects of CO2 leveled off with decreasing levels of relative humidity.\nC_LIO_LISynthesis. Our results show that a decrease in relative humidity, rather than an increase in temperature may be the key factor for the survival of dryland lichens under climate change and that CO2 fertilization effects might be offset by a reduction in non-rainfall water inputs in the future.

However, three-taxon statements methods are subject to important flaws related to information redundancy. We aim to study the behavior of three-taxon statements and the interactions among them in order to enhance their performance in evolutionary studies. We show here how specific interactions between three-taxon statements are responsible of the emergence of redundancy and dependency within trees, and how they can be used for the improvement of weighting procedures. Our proposal is subsequently empirically tested in the supertree framework using simulations. We show that three-taxon statements using fractional weights perform drastically better than classical methods such as MRP or methods using unweighted statements. Our study shows that appropriate fractional weighting of three taxon statements is of critical importance for removing redundancy in any method using three-taxon statements, as in consensus, supertrees, distance metrics, and phylogenetic or biogeographic analyses.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between parasite virulence and transmission is a pillar of evolutionary theory that has specific implications for public health. Part of this canon involves the idea that virulence and free-living survival (a key component of transmission) may have different relationships in different host-parasite systems. Most examinations of the evolution of virulence-transmission relationships--theoretical or empirical in nature--tend to focus on the evolution of virulence, with transmission a secondary consideration. And even within transmission studies, the focus on free-living survival is a smaller subset, though recent studies have examined its importance in the ecology of infectious diseases. Few studies have examined the epidemic-scale consequences of variation in survival across different virulence-survival relationships. In this study, we utilize a mathematical model motivated by aspects of SARS-CoV-2 natural history to investigate how evolutionary changes in survival may influence several aspects of disease dynamics at the epidemiological scale. Across virulence-survival relationships (where these traits are positively or negatively correlated), we found that small changes (5% above and below the nominal value) in survival can have a meaningful effect on certain outbreak features, including the R0, and the size of the infectious peak in the population. These results highlight the importance of properly understanding the mechanistic relationship between virulence and parasite survival, as evolution of increased survival across different relationships with virulence will have considerably different epidemiological signatures.",

    "abstract": "Horizontal transfer of genomic elements is an essential force that shapes microbial genome evolution. Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) occurs via various mechanisms and has been studied in detail for a variety of systems. However, a coarse-grained, global picture of HGT in the microbial world is still missing. One reason is the difficulty to process large amounts of genomic microbial data to find and characterise HGT events, especially for highly distant organisms. Here, we exploit the fact that HGT between distant species creates long identical DNA sequences in genomes of distant species, which can be found efficiently using alignment-free methods. We analysed over 90 000 bacterial genomes and thus identified over 100 000 events of HGT. We further developed a mathematical model to analyse the statistical properties of those long exact matches and thus estimate the transfer rate between any pair of taxa. Our results demonstrate that long-distance gene exchange (across phyla) is very frequent, as more than 8% of the bacterial genomes analysed have been involved in at least one such event. Finally, we confirm that the function of the transferred sequences strongly impact the transfer rate, as we observe a 3.5 order of magnitude variation between the most and the least transferred categories. Overall, we provide a unique view of horizontal transfer across the bacterial tree of life, illuminating a fundamental process driving bacterial evolution.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPhakopsora pachyrhizi is a biotrophic fungal pathogen responsible for the Asian soybean rust disease causing important yield losses in tropical and subtropical soybean-producing countries. P. pachyrhizi triggers important transcriptional changes in soybean plants during infection, with several hundreds of genes being either up- or downregulated.\n\nResultsBased on published transcriptomic data, we identified a predicted chitinase gene, referred to as GmCHIT1, that was upregulated in the first hours of infection. We first confirmed this early induction and showed that this gene was expressed as early as 8 hours after P. pachyrhizi inoculation. To investigate the promoter of GmCHIT1, transgenic soybean plants expressing the green fluorescence protein (GFP) under the control of the GmCHIT1 promoter were generated. Following inoculation of these transgenic plants with P. pachyrhizi, GFP fluorescence was detected in a limited area located around appressoria, the fungal penetration structures. Fluorescence was also observed after mechanical wounding whereas no variation in fluorescence of pGmCHIT1:GFP transgenic plants was detected after a treatment with an ethylene precursor or a methyl jasmonate analogue.\n\nConclusionWe identified a soybean chitinase promoter exhibiting an early induction by P. pachyrhizi located in the first infected soybean leaf cells. Our results on the induction of GmCHIT1 promoter by P. pachyrhizi contribute to the identification of a new pathogen inducible promoter in soybean and beyond to the development of a strategy for the Asian soybean rust disease control using biotechnological approaches.",

In this study, we performed DNA/RNA hybrid-capture sequencing on 12 locoregional recurrences after long-term estrogen-deprivation along with each tumors matched primary. Despite being up to 7 years removed from the primary lesion, most recurrences harbored similar intrinsic transcriptional and copy number profiles. Only two genes, AKAP9 and KMT2C, were found to have single nucleotide variant (SNV) enrichments in more than one recurrence. Enriched mutations in single cases included SNVs within transcriptional regulators such as ARID1A, TP53, FOXO1, BRD1, NCOA1 and NCOR2 with one local recurrence gaining three PIK3CA mutations. In contrast to DNA-level changes, we discovered recurrent outlier mRNA expression alterations were common--including outlier gains in TP63 (n=5 cases [42%]), NTRK3 [n=5 [42%]), NTRK2 (n=4 [33%]), PAX3 (n=4 [33%]), FGFR4 (n=3 [25%]) and TERT (n=3 [25%]). Recurrent losses involved ESR1 (n=5 [42%]), RELN (n=5 [42%]), SFRP4 (n=4 [33%]) and FOSB (n=4 [33%]). ESR1-depleted recurrences harbored shared transcriptional remodeling events including upregulation of PROM1 and other basal cancer markers. Taken together, this study defines acquired genomic changes in long-term, estrogen-deprived disease, highlights longitudinal RNA-profiling and identifies a common endocrine-resistant breast cancer subtype with basal-like transcriptional reprogramming.",

In CaMKII heterozygous knockout mice, which present deficits in spatial remote and working memory, the decoding accuracy of position in the open field and future location in the T-maze were selectively reduced.

Patch-clamp recordings in brain slices in vitro revealed changes in the passive properties and intrinsic excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, we observed increased neuronal input resistance and prolonged action potential width in CA1 pyramidal neurons.

    "abstract": "The lysosomal membrane protein NPC1 (Niemann-Pick type C1) and NPC2 (Niemann-Pick type C2) are main players of cholesterol control in lysosome and it is known that mutation on these proteins leads to cholesterol trafficking related disease, called Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) disease. The mutation R518W or R518Q on NPC1 is one of such disease-related mutations, causing reduced cholesterol transport by half, resulting in accumulation of cholesterol and lipids in late endosomal/lysosomal region of the cell. Even though there has been significant progress in understanding cholesterol transport by NPC1 in combination with NPC2, especially after the structural determination of full length NPC1 in 2016, many details such as interaction of full length NPC1 with NPC2, molecular motions responsible for cholesterol transport during and after this interaction, and structure and function relations of many mutations are still not well understood.\n\nWe report the extensive molecular dynamics simulations to gain insight into the structure and motions of NPC1 lumenal domain for cholesterol transport and disease behind the mutation (R518W). It is found that the mutation induces structural shift of NTD (N-terminal domain), toward the loop region in MLD (middle lumenal domain), which is believed to play central role in interaction with NPC2 protein, such that the interaction with NPC2 protein might be less favorable compare to wild NPC1. Also, the simulation indicates the possible re-orientation of the NTD, aligning to form an internal tunnel, after receiving the cholesterol from NPC2 with wild NPC1 unlike the mutated one, a possible pose for further action in cholesterol trafficking. We believe the current study can provide better understanding on the cholesterol transport by NPC1, especially the role of NTD of NPC1, in combination with NPC2 interaction.\n\nSynopsismodeling study of cholesterol binding protein NPC1",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHomologous recombination deficiency (HRD) in ovarian cancer confers increased sensitivity to Poly-ADP-Ribose-Polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and platinum. The homologous recombination (HR) mediator RAD51, however, is commonly overexpressed, potentially driving unregulated HR. Due to non-quantitative measurements and heterogeneous cohorts, the clinical relevance of RAD51 expression in ovarian cancer is unclear.\n\nMethodsFluorescent immunohistochemistry and multispectral imaging were used to quantitate RAD51 expression, in relation to other markers, in independent cohorts of ovarian carcinomas from British Columbia Cancer (BCC n=284) and the phase III SCOTROC4 trial (n=268). Independent cohorts (TCGA n=566, GSE9891 n=267, GSE26712 n=185 and GSE3149 n=146) were used for mRNA expression and immune infiltration analyses.\n\nResultsRAD51-High tumours had shorter progression-free and overall survival compared to RAD51-Low cases in both BCC and SCOTROC4. The negative prognostic significance of high RAD51 was primarily evident in cases classified \"HRD negative\" by the Myriad genomic scar assay. Unexpectedly, overexpression of RAD51 in ovarian cancer cell lines did not affect sensitivity to platinum or PARP inhibitors, but modified the expression of immune-regulatory genes. Accordingly, tumours with high RAD51 mRNA showed consistent changes in immunomodulatory transcripts across four independent ovarian cancer cohorts. In-situ multiplexed imaging confirmed that high RAD51 tumours correlated with tumour exclusion of cytotoxic-T-cells, possibly explaining their poor outcomes after chemotherapy.\n\nConclusionsHigh RAD51 expression, in conjunction with a HRD score <42, identifies a subgroup of EOC cases with platinum resistance and an immune excluded tumour microenvironment. Tumours with high RAD51 may require alternate or additional adjuvant therapeutic strategies to overcome immune exclusion.\n\nStatement of Translational RelevanceHomologous recombination deficiency (HRD) in ovarian cancer confers increased sensitivity to Poly-ADP-Ribose-Polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and platinum. Currently, methods to identify patients who do poorly on first-line platinum based chemotherapy in ovarian cancer represent an unmet clinical need. In this report we show that RAD51 expression can identify patients with primary platinum resistance in two large cohorts, including a unique phase-III trial of carboplatin as adjuvant monotherapy. The clinical relevance of a positive genomic scar HRD score, a biomarker for assessing HRD status, in predicting benefit to PARP inhibitors has been established following recent phase 3 trials in first line and 2nd line maintenance treatment of ovarian cancer. Our findings suggest that HRD negative ovarian tumours may be further stratified by RAD51 expression status in the context of platinum sensitivity, and may serve to guide future trials of HRD targeted agents.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes an objective statistical approach that can be used to decide between two alternate kinetic mechanisms of covalent enzyme inhibition from kinetic experiments based on the standard \"kobs\" method. The two alternatives are either a two-step kinetic mechanism, which involves a reversibly formed noncovalent intermediate, or a one-step kinetic mechanism, proceeding in a single bimolecular step. Recently published experimental data [Hopper et al. (2020) J. Pharm. Exp. Therap. 372, 331-338] on the irreversible inhibition of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) and tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (TEC) by ibrutinib (PCI-32765) and acalabrutinib are used as an illustrative example. The results show that the kinetic mechanism of inhibition was misdiagnosed in the original publication for at least one of the four enzyme/inhibitor combinations. In particular, based on the available kobs data, ibrutinib behaves effectively as a one-step inhibitor of the TEC enzyme, which means that it is not possible to reliably determine either the inhibition constant Ki or the inactivation rate constant kinact, but only the covalent efficiency constant keff = kinact/Ki. Thus, the published values of Ki and kinact for this system are not statistically valid.",

    "abstract": "Myxococcus xanthus arranges into two morphologically distinct biofilms depending on its nutritional status, i.e. coordinately spreading colonies in the presence of nutrients and spore-filled fruiting bodies in the absence of nutrients. A secreted polysaccharide referred to as exopolysaccharide (EPS) is a structural component of both biofilms and is also important for type IV pili-dependent motility and fruiting body formation. Here, we characterize the biosynthetic machinery responsible for EPS biosynthesis using bioinformatics, genetics, heterologous expression, and biochemical experiments. We show that this machinery constitutes a Wzx/Wzy-dependent pathway dedicated to EPS biosynthesis. Our data support that EpsZ (MXAN_7415) is the polyisoprenyl-phosphate hexose-1-phosphate transferase responsible for initiation of the repeat unit synthesis. Heterologous expression experiments support that EpsZ has galactose-1-P transferase activity. Moreover, MXAN_7416, renamed WzxEPS, and MXAN_7442, renamed WzyEPS, are the Wzx flippase and Wzy polymerase responsible for translocation and polymerization of the EPS repeat unit, respectively. Also, in this pathway, EpsV (MXAN_7421) is the polysaccharide co-polymerase and EpsY (MXAN_7417) the outer membrane polysaccharide export (OPX) protein. Mutants with single in-frame deletions in the five corresponding genes had defects in type IV pili-dependent motility and a conditional defect in fruiting body formation. Furthermore, all five mutants were deficient in type IV pili formation and genetic analyses suggest that EPS and/or the EPS biosynthetic machinery stimulates type IV pili extension. Additionally, we identify a polysaccharide biosynthesis gene cluster, which together with an orphan gene encoding an OPX protein make up a complete Wzx/Wzy-dependent pathway for synthesis of an unknown polysaccharide.\n\nImportanceThe secreted polysaccharide referred to as exopolysaccharide (EPS) has important functions in the social life cycle of M. xanthus; however, little is known about how EPS is synthesized. Here, we characterized the EPS biosynthetic machinery and show that it makes up a Wzx/Wzy-dependent pathway for polysaccharide biosynthesis. Mutants lacking a component of this pathway had reduced type IV pili-dependent motility and a conditional defect in development. Also, these analysis suggest that EPS and/or the EPS biosynthetic machinery is important for type IV pili formation.",

    "abstract": "Newly emerged pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 highlight the urgent need for assays that detect levels of neutralizing antibodies that may be protective. We studied the relationship between anti-spike ectodomain (ECD) and anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG titers, and SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization (VN) titers generated by two different in vitro assays using convalescent plasma samples obtained from 68 COVID-19 patients, including 13 who donated plasma multiple times. Only 23% (16/68) of donors had been hospitalized. We also studied 16 samples from subjects found to have anti-spike protein IgG during surveillance screening of asymptomatic individuals. We report a strong positive correlation between both plasma anti-RBD and anti-ECD IgG titers, and in vitro VN titer. Anti-RBD plasma IgG correlated slightly better than anti-ECD IgG titer with VN titer. The probability of a VN titer [&ge;]160 was 80% or greater with anti-RBD or anti-ECD titers of [&ge;]1:1350. Thirty-seven percent (25/68) of convalescent plasma donors lacked VN titers [&ge;]160, the FDA-recommended level for convalescent plasma used for COVID-19 treatment. Dyspnea, hospitalization, and disease severity were significantly associated with higher VN titer. Frequent donation of convalescent plasma did not significantly decrease either VN or IgG titers. Analysis of 2,814 asymptomatic adults found 27 individuals with anti-RBD or anti-ECD IgG titers of [&ge;]1:1350, and evidence of VN [&ge;]1:160. Taken together, we conclude that anti-RBD or anti-ECD IgG titers can serve as a surrogate for VN titers to identify suitable plasma donors.

    "abstract": "It is acknowledged that the bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) structure, a GlcNAc linked to the core {beta}-mannose residue via a {beta}1,4 linkage, represents a special type of N-glycosylated modification and has been reported to be involved in various biological processes, such as cell adhesion and fetal development. Clark et al. has found that the majority of N-glycans in human trophoblasts bearing a bisecting GlcNAc. This type of glycan has been reported to help trophoblasts get resistant to natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and this would provide a possible explanation for the question how could the mother nourish a fetus within herself without rejection. Herein, we hypothesized that human amniotic membrane which is the last barrier for the fetus may also express bisecting type glycans to protect the fetus. To test this hypothesis, glycomic analysis of human amniotic membrane was performed, and the bisecting N-glycans with high abundance were detected. In addition, we re-analyzed our proteomic data with high fractionation and amino acid sequence coverage from human amniotic membrane, which had been released for the exploration of human missing proteins. The presence of bisecting GlcNAc peptides was revealed and confirmed. A total of 41 glycoproteins with 43 glycopeptides were found to possess a bisecting GlcNAc, 25 of which are for the first time to be reported to have this type of modification. These results provide the profiling of bisecting GlcNAc modification in human amniotic membrane and benefit to the function studies of glycoproteins with bisecting GlcNAc modification and the function studies in immune suppression of human placenta.

    "abstract": "Most patients with COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), display neurological symptoms, and respiratory failure in certain cases could be of extra-pulmonary origin. Hypothalamic neural circuits play key roles in sex differences, diabetes, hypertension, obesity and aging, all risk factors for severe COVID-19, besides being connected to olfactory/gustative and brainstem cardiorespiratory centers. Here, human brain gene-expression analyses and immunohistochemistry reveal that the hypothalamus and associated regions express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane proteinase, serine 2, which mediate SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry, in correlation with genes or pathways involved in physiological functions or viral pathogenesis. A post-mortem patient brain shows viral invasion and replication in both the olfactory bulb and the hypothalamus, while animal studies indicate that sex hormones and metabolic diseases influence this susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "Loss of hepatic fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate aldolase B (Aldob) leads to a paradoxical upregulation of glucose metabolism to favor hepatocellular carcinogenesis but the upstream signaling events remain poorly defined. Akt is highly activated in HCC and targeting Akt is being explored as a potential therapy for HCC. Herein we demonstrate that Aldob suppresses Akt activity through a protein complex containing Aldob, Akt, and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), leading to inhibition of cell viability, cell cycle progression, glucose metabolism and tumor growth. Interestingly, Aldob directly interacts with phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) and promotes the recruitment of PP2A to dephosphorylate p-Akt, and this scaffolding effect of Aldob is independent of its enzymatic activity. Loss of Aldob or disruption of Aldob/Akt interaction in Aldob R304A mutant restores Akt activity and tumor promoting effects. Consistently, Aldob and p-Akt expression are inversely correlated in human HCC tissues, and Aldob downregulation coupled with p-Akt upregulation predicts a poor prognosis for HCC. We have further discovered that a specific small-molecule activator of PP2A (SMAP) efficiently attenuates HCC tumorigenesis in Aldob-deficient cell lines and xenografts. Our work reveals a novel non-glycolytic role of Aldob in negative regulation of Akt activation, suggesting that inhibiting Akt activity and reactivating PP2A may be a potential therapeutic approach for HCC treatment.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the primary cause of viral bronchiolitis resulting in hospitalization and a frequent cause of secondary respiratory bacterial infection, especially by Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) in infants. While murine studies have demonstrated enhanced morbidity during a viral/bacterial co-infection, human meta-studies have conflicting results. Moreover, little knowledge about the pathogenesis of emerging Spn serotype 22F, and especially the co-pathologies between RSV and Spn is known. Here, colostrum-deprived neonate lambs were divided into four groups. Two of the groups were nebulized with RSV M37, and the other two groups mock nebulized. At day 3 post-infection, one RSV group (RSV/Spn) and one mock-nebulized group (Spn only) were inoculated with Spn intratracheally. At day 6 post-infection, bacterial/viral loads were assessed along with histopathology and correlated with clinical symptoms. Lambs dually infected with RSV/Spn had higher RSV titers, but lower Spn. Additionally, lung lesions were observed to be more intense in the RSV/Spn group characterized by increased interalveolar wall thickness accompanied by neutrophil and lymphocyte infiltration. Despite lower Spn in lungs, co-infected lambs had more significant morbidity and histopathology, which correlated with a different cytokine response. Thus, enhanced disease severity during dual infection may be due to lesion development and altered immune responses rather than bacterial counts.",

    "abstract": "Aerodynamic function of the avian tail has previously been studied using observations of bird flight, physical models in wind tunnels, theoretical modelling and flow visualization. However, none of these approaches has provided rigorously quantitative evidence concerning tail functions since: appropriate manipulation and controls cannot be achieved using live animals; and the aerodynamic interplay with wings and body challenges reductive theoretical or physical modelling approaches. Here, we have developed a comprehensive analytical drag model, calibrated by high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and used it to investigate the aerodynamic action of the tail by virtually manipulating its posture. The bird geometry used for CFD was reconstructed previously using stereo photogrammetry of a freely gliding barn owl and validated against wake measurements. Using this CFD-calibrated drag model, we predicted the drag production for 16 gliding flights with a range of tail postures. These observed postures are set in the context of a wider parameter sweep of theoretical postures, where the tail spread and elevation angles were manipulated virtually. The observed postures of our gliding bird corresponded to near minimal total drag.Author Summary The aerodynamic contribution of bird tails is challenging to study; strong interactions between wings, body and tail make models isolating the contributions of different body parts difficult to interpret. Further, methods for direct manipulation are limited, and confounding compensation is likely in live, free-flying birds. To circumvent these issues, we applied high-fidelity CFD to a range of measured gliding owl geometries in order to develop a comprehensive analytical drag model. This enabled the drag implications of virtually-manipulated tail postures to be explored. The theoretical postures that cause minimum drag match those used by owls. The drag model demonstrates the importance of the viscous component of drag, which is of particular relevance to fliers at the scale of birds and, increasingly, smaller UAVs.View Full Text",

Both males and females started to aggregate on flowers at twilight; after that, mating began and remained for the entire night. The major constituent of the airborne volatiles from L. siceraria was fully characterized as (3S,6E)-nerolidol, which elicited electroantennographic responses on male and female antennae. Field bioassays showed that traps baited with the natural stereoisomer or a mix of nerolidol isomers captured significantly more males and females of C. paraguayensis than control traps. Analysis from the gut content of these Cyclocephalini beetles showed the presence of pollen, suggesting that they also use bottle gourd flowers for their nourishment. Taken together, these results suggest that (3S,6E)-nerolidol plays an essential role in the reproductive behavior of C. paraguayensis by eliciting aggregation, mating, and feeding.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR/Cas has opened the prospect of direct gene correction therapy for some inherited retinal diseases. Previous work has demonstrated the utility of adeno-associated virus (AAV) mediated delivery to retinal cells in vivo; however, with the expanding repertoire of CRISPR/Cas endonucleases, it is not clear which of these are most efficacious for retinal editing in vivo. We sought to compare CRISPR/Cas endonuclease activity using both single and dual AAV delivery strategies for gene editing in retinal cells. Plasmids of a dual vector system with SpCas9, SaCas9, Cas12a, CjCas9 and sgRNA targeting YFP and a single vector system with SaCas9/YFP sgRNA were generated and validated in YFP-expressing HEK293A cell by flow cytometry and T7E1 assay. Paired CRISPR/Cas endonuclease and its best performing sgRNA was then packaged into an AAV2 capsid derivative, AAV7m8, and injected intravitreally into CMV-Cre::Rosa26-YFP mice. SpCas9 and Cas12a achieved better knockout efficiency than SaCas9 and CjCas9. Moreover, no significant difference in YFP gene editing was found between single and dual CRISPR/SaCas9 vector systems. With a marked reduction of YFP-positive retinal cells, AAV7m8 delivered SpCas9 was found to have the highest knockout efficacy among all investigated endonucleases. We demonstrate that the AAV7m8-mediated delivery of CRISPR/SpCas9 construct achieves the most efficient gene modification in neurosensory retinal cells in vitro and in vivo.",

    "abstract": "An essential component of the homologous recombination machinery in eukaryotes, the RAD54 protein is a member of the SWI2/SNF2 family of helicases with dsDNA-dependent ATPase, DNA translocase, DNA supercoiling and chromatin remodelling activities. It is a motor protein that translocates along dsDNA and performs multiple functions in homologous recombination. In particular, RAD54 is an essential cofactor for regulating RAD51 activity. It stabilizes the RAD51 nucleofilament, remodels nucleosomes, and stimulates homology search and strand invasion activity of RAD51. Accordingly, deletion of RAD54 has dramatic consequences on DNA damage repair in mitotic cells. In contrast, its role in meiotic recombination is less clear.\n\nRAD54 is essential for meiotic recombination in Drosophila and C. elegans, but plays minor roles in yeast and mammals. We present here characterization of the roles of RAD54 in meiotic recombination in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Absence of RAD54 has no detectable effect on meiotic recombination in otherwise wild-type plants but RAD54 becomes essential for meiotic DSB repair in absence of DMC1. In Arabidopsis, dmc1 mutants have an achiasmate meiosis, in which RAD51 repairs meiotic DSBs. Absence of RAD54 in dmc1 mutants leads to meiotic chromosomal fragmentation. The action of RAD54 in meiotic RAD51 activity is thus downstream of the role of RAD51 in supporting the activity of DMC1. Equivalent analyses show no effect on meiosis of combining dmc1 with the mutants of the RAD51-mediators RAD51B, RAD51D and XRCC2.\n\nRAD54 is thus required for repair of meiotic DSBs by RAD51 and the absence of meiotic phenotype in rad54 plants is a consequence of RAD51 playing a RAD54-independent supporting role to DMC1 in meiotic recombination.\n\nAuthor SummaryHomologous recombination is a universal pathway which repairs broken DNA molecules through the use of homologous DNA templates. It is both essential for maintenance of genome stability and for the generation of genetic diversity through sexual reproduction. A central step of the homologous recombination process is the search for and invasion of a homologous intact DNA sequence that will be used as template. This key step is catalysed by the RAD51 recombinase in somatic cells and RAD51 and DMC1 in meiotic cells, assisted by a number of associated factors. Among these, the chromatin-remodelling protein RAD54 is a required cofactor for RAD51 in mitotic cells. Understanding of its role during meiotic recombination however remains elusive. We show here that RAD54 is required for repair of meiotic double strand breaks by RAD51 in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and this function is downstream of the meiotic role of RAD51 in supporting the activity of DMC1. These results provide new insights into the regulation of the central step of homologous recombination in plants and very probably also other multicellular eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Pathogens are often known to use host factor mimicry to take evolutionary advantage. As the function of the non-structural ORF8 protein of SARS-CoV-2 in the context of host-pathogen relationship is still obscure, we investigated its role in host factor mimicry using computational protein modelling techniques. Modest sequence similarity of ORF8 of SARS-CoV-2 with the substrate binding site within the C-terminus serine-protease catalytic domain of human complement factor 1 (F1; PDB ID: 2XRC), prompted us to verify their resemblance at the structural level. The modelled ORF8 protein was found to superimpose on the F1 fragment. Further, protein-protein interaction simulation confirmed ORF8 binding to C3b, an endogenous substrate of F1, via F1-interacting region on C3b. Docking results suggest ORF8 to occupy the binding groove adjacent to the conserved \"arginine-serine\" (RS) F1-mediated cleavage sites on C3b. Comparative H-bond interaction dynamics indicated ORF8/C3b binding to be of higher affinity than the F1/C3b interaction. Hence, ORF8 is predicted to inhibit C3b proteolysis by competing with F1 for C3b binding using molecular mimicry with a possibility of triggering unregulated complement activation. This could offer a mechanistic premise for the unrestrained complement activation observed in large number of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.",

    "abstract": "The oomycete plant pathogen, Phytophthora austrocedri, is an aggressive killer of cypress trees causing severe mortality of Chilean cedar (Austrocedrus chilensis) in Argentina since the 1940s and now common juniper (Juniperus communis s.l.) in the UK. Rapid mortality of key UK juniper populations was first observed in the early 2000s; the causal agent of mortality was confirmed as P. austrocedri in 2012 and the pathogen has now been widely detected - but is not ubiquitous - in juniper populations across Scotland and England. Although juniper has a broad distribution across the northern hemisphere, the UK incidence of P. austrocedri remains the only confirmed infection of juniper populations globally. Juniper is an important species for biodiversity, so it is imperative to understand the abiotic and biotic drivers of emergent P. austrocedri infection to inform detection, containment and conservation strategies to manage juniper populations across the full extent of its range.\n\nAs management of UK juniper populations is primarily conducted at a local level, we investigated field scale drivers of disease - in three, geographically separate populations with different infection histories. Variation in the proportion of juniper showing symptoms - discoloured or dead foliage - was measured using stratified sampling across along key environmental gradients within each 100-hectare population, including juniper density identified from aerial imagery. Potential predictors of infection included altitude, slope, distance to nearest watercourse, soil moisture (mean percentage volumetric water content), area of red deer browsing damage and area of commonly associated vascular plant species. We assessed support in the data for alternative models explaining the spatial distribution of P. austrocedri symptoms using full subset covariate selection and Deviance Information Criteria (DIC). Despite differences in environmental gradients and infection histories between populations, area of juniper symptomatic for P. austrocedri increased with waterlogging, increasing with soil moisture in sites where soils had higher peat or clay contents, and decreasing with proximity to watercourses where sites had shallower, sandier soils. These results are consistent with key drivers identified at both local and landscape scale in Chilean cedar. Our approach enables identification of site-specific disease management strategies including prioritisation of inspections in microsites with high soil moisture and promoting conservation measures such as creation of sites for natural regeneration in drier microsites to minimise pathogen spread and maximise the resilience of existing juniper populations.",

    "abstract": "The D-and L-forms of lactate are important fermentation metabolites produced by intestinal bacteria but have been found to negatively affect mucosal barrier function and human health. Of interest, both enantiomers of lactate can be converted with acetate into the presumed beneficial butyrate by a phylogenetically related group of anaerobes, including Anaerobutyricum and Anaerostipes spp. This is a low energy yielding process with a partially unknown pathway in Anaerobutyricum and Anaerostipes spp. and hence, we sought to address this via a comparative genomics, proteomics and physiology approach. We focused on Anaerobutyricum soehngenii and compared its growth on lactate with that on sucrose and sorbitol. Comparative proteomics revealed a unique active gene cluster that was abundantly expressed when grown on lactate. This active gene cluster, lctABCDEF, encodes a lactate dehydrogenase (lctD), electron transport proteins A and B (lctCB), along with a nickel-dependent racemase (lctE) and a lactate permease (lctF). Extensive search of available genomes of intestinal bacteria revealed this gene cluster to be highly conserved in only Anaerobutyricum and Anaerostipes spp. The present study demonstrates that A. soehngenii and several related Anaerobutyricum and Anaerostipes spp. are highly adapted for a lifestyle involving lactate plus acetate utilization in the human intestinal tract.",

    "abstract": "Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) is an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) that shows broad antiviral activities against a wide range of enveloped viruses. Here, using an ISG screen against VSV-SARS-CoV and VSV-SARS-CoV-2 chimeric viruses, we identified CH25H and its enzymatic product 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) as potent inhibitors of virus replication. Mechanistically, internalized 25HC accumulates in the late endosomes and blocks cholesterol export, thereby restricting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein catalyzed membrane fusion. Our results highlight a unique antiviral mechanism of 25HC and provide the molecular basis for its possible therapeutic development.",

    "abstract": "Coronaviruses that infect humans belong to the Alpha-coronavirus (including HCoV-229E) and Beta-coronavirus (including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) genera. In particular, SARS-CoV-2 is currently a major threat to public health worldwide. However, no commercial vaccines against the coronaviruses that can infect humans are available. The spike (S) homotrimers bind to their receptors through the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which is believed to be a major target to block viral entry. In this study, we selected Alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) and Beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) as models. Their RBDs were observed to adopt two different conformational states (lying or standing). Then, structural and immunological analyses were used to explore differences in the immune response with RBDs among these coronaviruses. Our results showed that more RBD-specific antibodies were induced by the S trimer with the RBD in the \"standing\" state (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) than the S trimer with the RBD in the \"lying\" state (HCoV-229E), and the affinity between the RBD-specific antibodies and S trimer was also higher in the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we found that the ability of the HCoV-229E RBD to induce neutralizing antibodies was much lower and the intact and stable S1 subunit was essential for producing efficient neutralizing antibodies against HCoV-229E. Importantly, our results reveal different vaccine strategies for coronaviruses, and S-trimer is better than RBD as a target for vaccine development in Alpha-coronavirus. Our findings will provide important implications for future development of coronavirus vaccines.\n\nImportanceOutbreak of coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV-2, poses a serious threat to global public health. Development of vaccines to prevent the coronaviruses that can infect humans has always been a top priority. Coronavirus spike (S) protein is considered as a major target for vaccine development. Currently, structural studies have shown that Alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) and Beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) RBDs are in lying and standing state, respectively. Here, we tested the ability of S-trimer and RBD to induce neutralizing antibodies among these coronaviruses. Our results showed that Beta-CoVs RBDs are in a standing state, and their S proteins can induce more neutralizing antibodies targeting RBD. However, HCoV-229E RBD is in a lying state, and its S protein induces a low level of neutralizing antibody targeting RBD. Our results indicate that Alpha-coronavirus is more conducive to escape host immune recognition, and also provide novel ideas for the development of vaccines targeting S protein.",

    "abstract": "Within vascular networks, wall shear stress (WSS) modulates endothelial cell proliferation and arteriovenous specification. Mechano-responsive signaling pathways enable vessels within a connected network to structurally adapt to properly partition blood flow between different parts of organ systems. Here, we study vascular regeneration in a zebrafish model system, performing tail amputation of the Dorsal Aorta (DA)-Posterior Cardinal Vein (PCV) embryonic circulatory loop (ECL) at 3 days post fertilization (dpf). Following severing the ECL, the topology of the micro-circular network is reorganized to engender local increase in blood flow and peak WSS in the closest Segmental Artery (SeA) to the amputation site. Remodeling of this artery increases its radius, and blood flow. These hemodynamic WSS cues activate post-angiogenic Notch-ephrinb2 signaling to guide network reconnection and restore microcirculation. Gain- and loss-of-function analyses of Notch and ephrinb2 pathways, manipulations of WSS by modulating myocardial contractility and blood viscosity directly implicate that hemodynamically activated post-angiogenic Notch-ephrinb2 signaling guides network reconnection and restore microcirculation. Taken together, amputation of the DA-PCV loop induces changes in microvascular topology to partition blood flow and increase WSS-mediated Notch-ephrinb2 pathway, driving the new DLAV-PCV loop formation for restoring local microcirculation.",

    "abstract": "Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents approximately 10-15% of all breast cancers and has a poor outcome as it lacks a receptor target for therapy, and TNBC is frequently associated with a germline mutation of BRCA1. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) drugs have demonstrated some effectiveness in treating BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutated breast and ovarian cancers but resistance to PARPi is common. Published results found that resistance to Olaparib, a PARPi, can be due to downregulation of EMI1 and the consequent upregulation of the RAD51 recombinase. Using a tissue culture-based cell viability assay, we extended those observations to another PARPi and to other chemotherapy drugs that affect DNA repair or the cell cycle. As we expected, EMI1 downregulation resulted in resistance to another PARPi drug, Talazoparib. EMI1 downregulation also led to resistance to other cytotoxic drugs, Cisplatin and CHK1 inhibitor. Surprisingly, EMI1 depletion also led to resistance to a MEK inhibitor, though this inhibitor blocks cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle and would not be expected to be sensitive to EMI1 levels. Notably, increasing the RAD51 protein expression only partially recapitulated the effects of EMI1 depletion in causing resistance to different PARPi and the other cytotoxic drugs. These results suggest that the downstream effects of EMI1 downregulation that contribute to PARPi resistance are increasing the concentration of RAD51 protein in the cell and blocking mitotic entry. We found that combining CHK1 inhibitor with olaparib results in restoration of sensitivity even when EMI1 expression is downregulated. This combination therapy may be a means to overcome the PARPi resistance in BRCA1-deficient TNBC cells.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to unprecedented, nearly real-time genetic tracing due to the rapid community sequencing response. Researchers immediately leveraged these data to infer the evolutionary relationships among viral samples and to study key biological questions, including whether host viral genome editing and recombination are features of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. This global sequencing effort is inherently decentralized and must rely on data collected by many labs using a wide variety of molecular and bioinformatic techniques. There is thus a strong possibility that systematic errors associated with lab-specific practices affect some sequences in the repositories. We find that some recurrent mutations in reported SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences have been observed predominantly or exclusively by single labs, co-localize with commonly used primer binding sites and are more likely to affect the protein coding sequences than other similarly recurrent mutations. We show that their inclusion can affect phylogenetic inference on scales relevant to local lineage tracing, and make it appear as though there has been an excess of recurrent mutation and/or recombination among viral lineages. We suggest how samples can be screened and problematic mutations removed. We also develop tools for comparing and visualizing differences among phylogenies and we show that consistent clade- and tree-based comparisons can be made between phylogenies produced by different groups. These will facilitate evolutionary inferences and comparisons among phylogenies produced for a wide array of purposes. Building on the SARS-CoV-2 Genome Browser at UCSC, we present a toolkit to compare, analyze and combine SARS-CoV-2 phylogenies, find and remove potential sequencing errors and establish a widely shared, stable clade structure for a more accurate scientific inference and discourse.\n\nForewordWe wish to thank all groups that responded rapidly by producing these invaluable and essential sequence data. Their contributions have enabled an unprecedented, lightning-fast process of scientific discovery---truly an incredible benefit for humanity and for the scientific community. We emphasize that most lab groups with whom we associate specific suspicious alleles are also those who have produced the most sequence data at a time when it was urgently needed. We commend their efforts. We have already contacted each group and many have updated their sequences. Our goal with this work is not to highlight potential errors, but to understand the impacts of these and other kinds of highly recurrent mutations so as to identify commonalities among the suspicious examples that can improve sequence quality and analysis going forward.",
