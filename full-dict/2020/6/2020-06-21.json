    "abstract": "Rapidly evolving RNA viruses continuously produce minority haplotypes that can become dominant if they are drug-resistant or can better evade the immune system. Therefore, early detection and identification of minority viral haplotypes may help to promptly adjust the patient's treatment plan preventing potential disease complications. Minority haplotypes can be identified using next-generation sequencing (NGS), but sequencing noise hinders accurate identification. The elimination of sequencing noise is a non-trivial task that still remains open. Here we propose CliqueSNV based on extracting pairs of statistically linked mutations from noisy reads. This effectively reduces sequencing noise and enables identifying minority haplotypes with the frequency below the sequencing error rate. We comparatively assess the performance of CliqueSNV using an in vitro mixture of nine haplotypes that were derived from the mutation profile of an existing HIV patient. We show that CliqueSNV can accurately assemble viral haplotypes with frequencies as low as 0.1% and maintains consistent performance across short and long bases sequencing platforms.",

    "abstract": "Orthologs diverge after lineage separation events and paralogs after gene duplications. Thus, orthologs are expected to remain more functionally coherent across lineages, while paralogs have been proposed as a source of new functions. Because protein functional divergence follows from non-synonymous substitutions, we performed an analysis based on the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS), as proxy for functional divergence. We used five working definitions of orthology, including reciprocal best hits (RBH), among other definitions based on network analyses and clustering. The results showed that orthologs, by all definitions tested, had values of dN/dS noticeably lower than those of paralogs, suggesting that, as a group, orthologs tend to be more functionally stable than paralogs. The differences in dN/dS ratios remained suggesting the functional stability of orthologs after eliminating gene comparisons with potential problems, such as genes with high codon usage biases, low coverage of either of the aligned sequences, or sequences with very high similarities. Separation by percent identity of the encoded proteins showed that the differences between the dN/dS ratios of orthologs and paralogs were more evident at high sequence identity, less so as identity dropped. While the last results partially explained the differences between dN/dS ratios of the two groups as being related to differences in protein identity, they also suggested that paralogs undergo functional divergence relatively early after duplication. Our analyses indicate that choosing orthologs as probably functionally coherent remains the right approach in comparative genomics.",

Although significant efforts have been made to advance our understanding of this important phylum, still little is known about how members of the cyanobacteria affect and respond to changes in complex biological systems. This lack of knowledge is in part due to our dependence on pure cultures when determining the metabolism and function of a microorganism. In the work presented here we took advantage of the Culture Collection of Microorganisms from Extreme Environments (CCMEE), a collection of more than 1,000 publicly available photosynthetic co-cultures now maintained at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. To highlight some of their scientific potential, we selected 26 of these photosynthetic co-cultures from the CCMEE for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We assessed if samples readily available from the CCMEE could be used to generate new insights into the role of microbial communities in global and local carbon and nitrogen cycling. Results from this work support the existing notion that culture depositories in general hold the potential to advance fundamental and applied research. If collections of co-cultures can be used to infer roles of the individual organisms remains to be seen and requires further investigation.",

In this prospective double-blind randomized clinical trial, we investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of combining CCT and tDCS, and tested the predictive value of and training-related changes in fMRI-based brain activation during attentive performance (multiple object tracking) obtained at inclusion, before initiating training, and after the three-weeks intervention in chronic stroke patients (> 6 months since hospital admission). Patients were randomized to one of two groups, receiving CCT and either (1) tDCS targeting left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (1 mA), or (2) sham tDCS, with 40s active stimulation (1 mA) before fade out of the current. 77 patients were enrolled in the study, 54 completed the cognitive training, and 48 completed all training and MRI sessions. We found significant improvement in performance across all trained tasks, but no additional gain of tDCS. fMRI-based brain activation showed high reliability, and higher cognitive performance was associated with increased tracking-related activation in the dorsal attention network (DAN) and default mode network (DMN) as well as anterior cingulate after compared to before the intervention. We found no significant associations between cognitive gain and brain activation measured before training or in the difference in activation after intervention. Combined, these results show significant training effects on trained cognitive tasks in stroke survivors, with no clear evidence of additional gain of concurrent tDCS.",

Determining the haplotype phase requires knowledge of both the genotypes at variant sites and their linkage across each chromosome. Haplotype linkage can be either inferred statistically from a genotyped population, or determined by long-range sequencing of an individual genome. However, extending haplotype inference to the whole-chromosome scale remains challenging and usually requires special experimental techniques. Here we describe a general computational strategy to determine complete chromosomal haplotypes using a combination of bulk long-range sequencing and Hi-C sequencing. We demonstrate that this strategy can resolve the haplotypes of parental chromosomes in diploid human genomes at high precision (99%) and completeness (98%), and is further able to assemble the syntenic organization of aneuploid genomes (\"digital karyotype\").",

    "abstract": "We propose an extended Gaussian mixture model for the distribution of causal effects of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for human complex phenotypes that depends on linkage disequilibrium (LD) and heterozygosity (H), while also allowing for independent components for small and large effects. Using a precise methodology showing how genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics (z-scores) arise through LD with underlying causal SNPs, we applied the model to GWAS of multiple human phenotypes. Our findings indicated that causal effects are distributed with dependence on total LD and H, whereby SNPs with lower total LD and H are more likely to be causal with larger effects; this dependence is consistent with models of the influence of negative pressure from natural selection. Compared with the basic Gaussian mixture model it is built on, the extended model - primarily through quantification of selection pressure - reproduces with greater accuracy the empirical distributions of z-scores, thus providing better estimates of genetic quantities, such as polygenicity and heritability, that arise from the distribution of causal effects.",

    "abstract": "Our goal was to elucidate microRNAs (miRNAs) that may repress the excess bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling observed during pathological calcification in the Klotho mouse model of kidney disease. We hypothesized that restoring healthy levels of miRNAs that post-transcriptionally repress osteogenic calcific factors may decrease aortic calcification. Our relative abundance profiles of miRNAs in healthy aorta differ greatly from those in calcified mouse aorta. Many of these miRNAs are predicted to regulate proteins involved in BMP signaling and may control osteogenesis. Two differentially regulated miRNAs, miR-145 and miR-378, were selected based on three criteria: reduced levels in calcified aorta, the ability to target more than one protein in the BMP signaling pathway, and conservation of targeted sequences between humans and mice. Forced expression using a lentiviral vector demonstrated that restoring normal levels repressed the synthesis of BMP2 and other pro-osteogenic proteins and inhibited pathological aortic calcification in Klotho mice with renal insufficiency. This study identified miRNAs that may impact BMP signaling in both sexes and demonstrated the efficacy of selected miRNAs in reducing aortic calcification in vivo. Calcification of the aorta and the aortic valve resulting from abnormal osteogenesis is common in those with kidney disease, diabetes, and high cholesterol. Such vascular osteogenesis is a clinically significant feature. The calcification modulating miRNAs described here are candidates for biomarkers and \"miRNA replacement therapies\" in the context of chronic kidney disease and other pro-calcific conditions.",

The barley (Hordeum vulgare) ROP protein RACB, is a susceptibility factor in the interaction of barley with the barley powdery mildew fungus Blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei (Bgh). RACB also drives polar cell development, and this function might be coopted during formation of fungal haustoria in barley epidermal cells. In order to understand RACB signaling during the interaction of barley with Bgh, we searched for potential downstream interactors of RACB. Here, we show that ROP INTERACTIVE PARTNER b (RIPb, synonym: INTERACTOR OF CONSTITUTIVE ACTIVE ROP b; ICRb) directly interacts with RACB in yeast and in planta. Over-expression of RIPb supports susceptibility of barley to Bgh. RIPb further interacts with itself at microtubules. However, the interaction with activated RACB takes place at the plasma membrane. Both, RIPb and RACB are recruited to the site of fungal attack around the neck of developing haustoria suggesting locally enhanced ROP activity. We further assigned different functions to different domains of the RIPb protein. The N-terminal coiled-coil CC1 domain is required for microtubule localization, while the C-terminal coiled-coil CC2 domain is sufficient to interact with RACB and to fulfill a function in susceptibility at the plasma membrane. Hence, RIPb appears to be localized at microtubules and is then recruited by activated RACB for a function at the plasma membrane during formation of the haustorial complex.\n\nOne Sentence summaryRIPb acts downstream of the powdery mildew susceptibility factor RACB of barley and influences susceptibility",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA gradual decline in renal function occurs even in healthy aging individuals. In addition to aging per se, concurrent metabolic syndrome and hypertension, which are common in the aging population, can induce mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation, which collectively contribute to age-related kidney dysfunction and disease. Here we studied the role of the nuclear hormone receptors, the estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) in regulation of age-related mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation. ERRs were decreased in aging human and mouse kidneys and were preserved in aging mice with lifelong caloric restriction (CR).\n\nMethodsA pan-ERR agonist was used to treat 21-month-old mice for 8-weeks. In addition, 21-month-old mice were treated with a STING inhibitor for 3 weeks.\n\nResultsRemarkably, only an 8-week treatment with a pan-ERR agonist reversed the age-related increases in albuminuria, podocyte loss, mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammatory cytokines, including the cGAS-STING and STAT3 signaling pathways. A 3-week treatment of 21-month-old mice with a STING inhibitor reversed the increases in inflammatory cytokines and the senescence marker p21 but also unexpectedly reversed the age-related decreases in PGC-1, ERR, mitochondrial complexes and MCAD expression.\n\nConclusionsOur studies identified ERRs as important modulators of age-related mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation. These findings highlight novel druggable pathways that can be further evaluated to prevent progression of age-related kidney disease.\n\nSignificance StatementThere is an increasing need for prevention and treatment strategies for age-related kidney disease.

    "abstract": "Recent resting-state fMRI studies have revealed that the global signal (GS) exhibits a non-uniform spatial distribution across the gray matter. Whether this topography is informative remains largely unknown. We therefore tested rest-task modulation of global signal topography by analyzing static global signal correlation and dynamic co-activation patterns in a large sample of fMRI dataset (n=837) from the Human Connectome Project. The GS topography in the resting-state and in seven different tasks was first measured by correlating the global signal with the local timeseries (GSCORR). In the resting state, high GSCORR was observed mainly in the primary sensory and motor regions, while low GSCORR was seen in the association brain areas. This pattern changed during the seven tasks, with mainly decreased GSCORR in sensorimotor cortex. Importantly, this rest-task modulation of GSCORR could be traced to transient co-activation patterns at the peak period of global signal (GS-peak). By comparing the topography of GSCORR and respiration effects, we observed that the topography of respiration mimicked the topography of global signal in the resting-state whereas both differed during the task states; due to such partial dissociation, we assume that GSCORR could not be equated with a respiration effect. Finally, rest-task modulation of GS topography could not be exclusively explained by other sources of physiological noise. Together, we here demonstrate the informative nature of global signal topography by showing its rest-task modulation, the underlying dynamic co-activation patterns, and its partial dissociation from respiration effects during task states.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic regulation is important in human health and disease, but the exact mechanisms remain largely enigmatic. DNA methylation represents one well-studied aspect of epigenetic regulation, but is challenging to quantify accurately. In this study, we introduce a digital approach for the absolute quantification of the amount, density and allele-specificity of DNA methylation. Combining the efficiency of methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes with the quantitative power of digital PCR, DNA methylation is measured accurately without the need to treat the DNA samples with sodium bisulphite. Moreover, as the combination of PCR amplicon and restriction enzyme is flexible, the context and density of DNA methylation can be taken into account. Additionally, by extending the experimental setup to a multiplex digital PCR, methylation markers may be analysed together with physically linked genetic markers to determine the allele-specificity of the methylation. In-silico simulations demonstrated the mathematical validity of the experimental setup. Next the approach was validated in a variety of healthy and malignant reference samples in the context of RASSF1A promotor methylation. RASSF1A is an established tumour suppressor gene, that is aberrantly methylated in many human cancers. A dilution series of well-characterized reference samples cross-validated the sensitivity and dynamic range of the approach. Compared to conventional PCR based methods, digital PCR provides a more accurate and more sensitive approach to quantify DNA methylation. As no sodium bisulphite conversion is needed, also analysis of minute amounts of DNA could be carried out efficiently.",

    "abstract": "Motor imagery (MI) is known to engage motor networks and could compensate for the maladaptive neuroplasticity elicited by immobilization. This hypothesis and associated underlying neural mechanisms remain underexplored. Here, we investigated how MI practice during 11 h of arm-immobilization influences sensorimotor and cortical representations of the hands, as well as sleep. Fourteen participants were first tested after a normal day, followed by two 11-h periods of immobilization, either with concomitant MI treatment or control tasks. Data revealed that MI prevented the consequences of immobilization: (i) alteration of the sensorimotor representation of hands, (ii) decrease of cortical excitability over the primary motor cortex (M1) contralateral to arm-immobilization, and (iii) reduction of sleep spindles over both M1s. Furthermore, (iv) the time spent in REM sleep was significantly longer after MI. These results support that implementing MI during immobilization can limit the deleterious effects of limb disuse, at several levels of sensorimotor functioning.",

    "abstract": "Whole-genome duplication (WGD) is hypothesized to be an important evolutionary mechanism that can facilitate adaptation and speciation. Genomes that exist in states of both diploidy and residual tetraploidy are of particular interest, as mechanisms that maintain the ploidy mosaic after WGD may provide important insights into evolutionary processes. The Salmonidae family exhibits residual tetraploidy, and this, combined with the evolutionary diversity formed after an ancestral autotetraploidization event, makes this group a useful study system. In this study, we generate a novel linkage map for cisco (Coregonus artedi), an economically and culturally important fish in North America and a member of the subfamily Coregoninae, which previously lacked a high-density haploid linkage map. We also conduct comparative genomic analyses to refine our understanding of chromosomal fusion/fission history across salmonids. To facilitate this comparative approach, we use the naming strategy of protokaryotype identifiers (PKs) to associate duplicated chromosomes to their putative ancestral state. The female linkage map for cisco contains 20,292 loci, 3,225 of which are likely within residually tetraploid regions. Comparative genomic analyses revealed that patterns of residual tetrasomy are generally conserved across species, although interspecific variation persists. To determine the broad-scale retention of residual tetrasomy across the salmonids, we analyze sequence similarity of currently available genomes and find evidence of residual tetrasomy in seven of the eight chromosomes that have been previously hypothesized to show this pattern. This interspecific variation in extent of rediploidization may have important implications for understanding salmonid evolutionary histories and informing future conservation efforts.",

    "abstract": "Deformed wing virus (DWV) is a persistent pathogen of European honey bees and the major contributor to overwintering colony losses. The prevalence of DWV in honey bees has led to significant concerns about spillover of the virus to other pollinating species. Bumble bees are both a major group of wild and commercially-reared pollinators. Several studies have reported pathogen spillover of DWV from honey bees to bumble bees, but evidence of a true sustained viral infection has yet to be demonstrated. Here we investigate the infectivity and transmission of DWV in bumble bees using the buff-tailed bumble bee Bombus terrestris as a model. We apply a reverse genetics approach combined with controlled laboratory conditions to detect and monitor DWV infection. A novel reverse genetics system for three representative DWV variants, including the two master variants of DWV - type A and B - was used. Our results directly confirm DWV replication in bumble bees but also demonstrate striking resistance to infection by certain routes. Bumble bees may support DWV replication but it is not clear how infection could occur under natural environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "The differentiation of neurons and formation of connections between cells is the basis of both the adult phenotype and behaviors tied to cognition, perception, reproduction, and survival. Such behaviors are associated with local (circuits) and global (connectome) brain networks. A solid understanding of how these networks emerge is critical. This opinion piece features a guided tour of early developmental events in the emerging connectome, which is crucial to a new view on the connectogenetic process. Connectogenesis includes associating cell identities with broader functional and developmental relationships. During this process, the transition from developmental cells to terminally differentiated cells is defined by an accumulation of traits that ultimately results in neuronal-driven behavior. The well-characterized developmental and cell biology of C. elegans will be used to build a synthesis of developmental events that result in a functioning connectome. Specifically, our view of connectogenesis enables a first-mover model of synaptic connectivity to be demonstrated using data representing larval synaptogenesis. In a first-mover model of Stackleberg competition, potential pre- and postsynaptic relationships are shown to yield various strategies for establishing various types of synaptic connections. By comparing these results to what is known regarding principles for establishing complex network connectivity, these strategies are generalizable to other species and developmental systems. In conclusion, we will discuss the broader implications of this approach, as what is presented here informs an understanding of behavioral emergence and the ability to simulate related biological phenomena.\n\nHighlightsO_LIwe can understand the complexity of connectomes in terms of their emergence from embryogenetic precursors, connection dynamics, and relationship to organismal behavior.\nC_LIO_LIa first-mover competition model can explain how neuronal cells follow a specific set of heuristic strategies to form chemical synapses with other cells in larval development.\nC_LIO_LIthe timing and relative order of terminal differentiation in Caenorhabditis elegans are shown to have both subtle and consequential effects on patterns of connectivity.\nC_LIO_LIa correspondence is established between the emergence of small connectomes and the emergence of specific behavioral outcomes in both animal and in silico models.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe ascending aorta is a common location for aneurysm and dissection. This aortic region is populated by a mosaic of medial and adventitial cells that are embryonically derived from either the second heart field (SHF) or the cardiac neural crest. SHF-derived cells populate areas that coincide with the spatial specificity of thoracic aortopathies. The purpose of this study was to determine whether and how SHF-derived cells contribute to ascending aortopathies.\n\nMethodsAscending aortic pathologies were examined in patients with sporadic thoracic aortopathies and angiotensin II (AngII)-infused mice. Ascending aortas without overt pathology from AngII-infused mice were subjected to mass spectrometry assisted proteomics, and molecular features of SHF-derived cells were determined by single cell transcriptomic analyses. Genetic deletion of either low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (Lrp1) or transforming growth factor-{beta} receptor 2 (Tgfbr2) in SHF- derived cells was conducted to examine the impact of SHF-derived cells on vascular integrity.\n\nResultsPathologies in human ascending aortic aneurysmal tissues were predominant in outer medial layers and adventitia. This gradient was mimicked in mouse aortas following AngII infusion that was coincident with the distribution of SHF-derived cells. Proteomics indicated that brief AngII infusion, prior to overt pathology, evoked downregulation of SMC proteins and differential expression of extracellular matrix proteins, including several LRP1 ligands. LRP1 deletion in SHF-derived cells augmented AngII-induced ascending aortic aneurysm and rupture. Single cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that brief AngII infusion decreased Lrp1 and Tgfbr2 mRNA abundance in SHF-derived cells and induced a unique fibroblast population with low abundance of Tgfbr2 mRNA. SHF-specific Tgfbr2 deletion led to embryonic lethality at E12.5 with dilatation of the outflow tract and retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Integration of proteomic and single cell transcriptomics results identified plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI1) as the most increased protein in SHF-derived SMCs and fibroblasts during AngII infusion. Immunostaining revealed a transmural gradient of PAI1 in both ascending aortas of AngII-infused mice and human ascending aneurysmal aortas that mimicked the gradient of medial and adventitial pathologies.\n\nConclusionSHF-derived cells exert a critical role in maintaining vascular integrity through LRP1 and TGF-{beta} signaling associated with increases of aortic PAI1.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=89 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/930917v6_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (34K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@185e3d9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@131d702org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11afa42org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@242786_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Clinical PerspectiveO_ST_ABSWhat is new?C_ST_ABS- SHF-derived SMCs and fibroblasts associate with AngII-induced aortic pathologies.\n- AngII induces a distinct fibroblast sub-cluster that is less abundant for mRNAs related to major extracellular components and TGF{beta} ligands and receptors, but more abundant for proliferative genes.\n- TGFBR2 deletion in SHF-derived cells are embryonic lethal with significant dilatation of the outflow tract in mice.\n- SHF-specific deletion of LRP1 leads to aortic pathologies in mice, supporting the importance of SHF-derived cells in maintaining ascending aortic wall integrity.\n\n\nWhat are the clinical implications?- Heterogeneity of the embryonic origins of SMCs and fibroblasts contributes to complex mechanisms of vasculopathy formation, which should be considered when investigating the pathogenesis of thoracic aortopathies.",

    "abstract": "RNA editing is an epitranscriptomic modification of emerging relevance to disease development and manifestations. ADAR1, which resides on human chromosome 1q21, is an RNA editor whose over-expression, either by interferon (IFN) induction or through gene amplification, is associated with increased editing and poor outcomes in Multiple Myeloma (MM). Here we explored the role of ADAR1 in the context of MM progression, by focusing on a group of 23 patients in the MMRF CoMMpass Study for which RNAseq and WES datasets exist for matched pre-and post-relapse samples. Our analysis reveals an acquisition of new DNA mutations on disease progression at specific loci surrounding the sites of ADAR associated (A-to-I) RNA editing. These analyses suggest that the RNA editing enzyme ADAR1 can function as a DNA mutator during Multiple Myeloma (MM) progression, and further imply that guide-targeted RNA editing has the capacity to generate specific mutational signatures at predetermined locations. This dual role of RNA editor and DNA mutator might be shared by other deaminases, such as APOBECs, so that DNA mutation might be the result of collateral damage on the genome by an editing enzyme whose primary job is to re-code the cognate transcript toward specific functional outcomes.",

In this context, it has been recently shown that packing optimization in bended/folded epithelia is achieved by a surface tension energy minimization mechanism that leads to a novel cellular shape: the scutoid. However, further cellular and tissue level implications of this new developmental paradigm remain unknown. Here we focus on the relationship between this complex cellular shape and the connectivity between cells. We address this problem using a combination of computational, experimental, and biophysical approaches in tubular epithelia. In particular, we examine how energy drivers affect the three-dimensional packing of these tissues. We challenge our biophysical model by reducing the cell adhesion in epithelial cells. As a result, we observed an increment on the cell apico-basal intercalation propensity that correlated with a decrease of the energy barrier necessary to connect with new cells. We conclude that tubular epithelia satisfy a quantitative biophysical principle, that links tissue geometry and energetics with the average cellular connectivity.",

In particular, configuring image processing parameters for optimal cell profiling is susceptible to cognitive biases and dependent on user experience. Here, we use interactive machine learning to identify the optimum cell profiling configuration that maximises quality of the cell profiling outcome. The process is guided by the user, from whom a rating of the quality of a cell profiling configuration is obtained. We use Bayesian optimisation, an established machine learning algorithm, to learn from this information and automatically recommend the next configuration to examine with the aim to maximize the quality of the processing or analysis. Compared to existing interactive machine learning tools that require domain expertise for per-class or per-pixel annotations, we rely on users explicit assessment of output quality of the cell profiling task at hand. We validated our interactive approach against the standard human trial-and-error scheme to optimise an object segmentation task using the standard software CellProfiler. Our toolkit enabled rapid optimisation of an object segmentation pipeline, increasing the quality of object segmentation over a pipeline optimised through trial-and-error. Users also attested to the ease of use and reduced cognitive load enabled by our machine learning strategy over the standard approach. We envision that our interactive machine learning approach can enhance the quality and efficiency of pipeline optimisation to democratise image-based cell profiling.",

    "abstract": "Lymphogenic spread is associated with poor prognosis in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), yet little is known regarding roles of non-peri-tumoural lymphatic vessels (LVs) outside the tumour microenvironment that may impact relapse. The aim of this feasibility study was to assess whether inflammatory status of the LVs and/or changes in the miRNA profile of the LVs have potential prognostic and predictive value for overall outcome and risk of relapse. Samples of macroscopically normal human lymph LVs (n=10) were isolated from the external iliac vessels draining the pelvic region of patients undergoing debulking surgery. This was followed by quantification of the inflammatory state (low, medium and high) and presence of cancer-infiltration of each LV using immunohistochemistry. LV miRNA expression profiling was also performed, and analysed in the context of high versus low inflammation, and cancer-infiltrated versus non-cancer-infiltrated. Results were correlated with clinical outcome data including relapse with an average follow-up time of 13.3 months. The presence of a high degree of inflammation correlated significantly with patient relapse (p=0.033). Cancer-infiltrated LVs showed a moderate but non-significant association with relapse (p=0.07). Differential miRNA profiles were identified in cancer-infiltrated LVs and those with high versus low inflammation. In particular, several members of the let-7 family were consistently down-regulated in highly inflamed LVs (>1.8-fold, p<0.05) compared to the less inflamed ones. Down-regulation of the let-7 family appears to be associated with inflammation, but whether inflammation contributes to or is an effect of cancer-infiltration requires further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Forest management alters the growing conditions and thus further development of trees. However, quantitative assessment of forest management on tree growth has been demanding as methodologies for capturing changes comprehensively in space and time have been lacking. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) has shown to be capable of providing three-dimensional (3D) tree stem reconstructions required for revealing differences between stem shapes and sizes. In this study, we used 3D reconstructions of tree stems from TLS and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to investigate how varying thinning treatments and the following growth effects affected stem shape and size of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees. The results showed that intensive thinning resulted in more stem volume and therefore total biomass allocation and carbon uptake compared to the moderate thinning. Relationship between tree height and diameter at breast height (i.e. slenderness) varied between both thinning intensity and type (i.e. from below and above) indicating differing response to thinning and allocation of stem growth of Scots pine trees. Furthermore, intensive thinning, especially from below, produced less variation in relative stem attributes characterizing stem shape and size. Thus, it can be concluded that thinning intensity, type, and the following growth effects have an impact on post-thinning stem shape and size of Scots pine trees. Our study presented detailed measurements on post-thinning stem growth of Scots pines that have been laborious or impracticable before the emergence of detailed 3D technologies. Moreover, the stem reconstructions from TLS and UAV provided variety of attributes characterizing stem shape and size that have not traditionally been feasible to obtain. The study demonstrated that detailed 3D technologies, such as TLS and UAV, provide information that can be used to generate new knowledge for supporting forest management and silviculture as well as improving ecological understanding of boreal forests.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria and chloroplasts emerged from primary endosymbiosis. Most proteins of the endosymbiont were subsequently expressed in the nucleo-cytosol of the host and organelle-targeted via the acquisition of N-terminal presequences, whose evolutionary origin remains enigmatic. Using a quantitative assessment of their physico-chemical properties, we show that organelle targeting peptides, which are distinct from signal peptides targeting other subcellular compartments, group with a subset of antimicrobial peptides. We demonstrate that extant antimicrobial peptides target a fluorescent reporter to either the mitochondria or the chloroplast in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and, conversely, that extant targeting peptides still display antimicrobial activity. Thus, we provide strong computational and functional evidence for an evolutionary link between organelle-targeting and antimicrobial peptides. Our results support the view that resistance of bacterial progenitors of organelles to the attack of host antimicrobial peptides has been instrumental in eukaryogenesis and in emergence of photosynthetic eukaryotes.",

Currently, human and microbial contaminant DNA still impose challenges on cost-effective sequencing and accurate interpretation of ancient DNA data.\n\nResultsHere we investigate whether human contaminating DNA can be found in ancient faunal sequencing datasets. We identify variable levels of human contamination, which persists even after the sequence reads have been mapped to the faunal reference genomes. This contamination has the potential to affect a range of downstream analyses.\n\nConclusionsWe propose a fast and simple method, based on competitive mapping, which allows identifying and removing human contamination from ancient faunal DNA datasets with limited losses of true ancient data.

    "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols often include a manual search of an optimal location and orientation of the coil or peak stimulating electric field to elicit motor responses in a target muscle. This target search is laborious, and the result is user-dependent. Here, we present a closed-loop search method that utilizes automatic electronic adjustment of the stimulation based on the previous responses. The electronic adjustment is achieved by multi-locus TMS, and the adaptive guiding of the stimulation is based on the principles of Bayesian optimization to minimize the number of stimuli (and time) needed in the search. We compared our target-search method with other methods, such as systematic sampling in a predefined cortical grid. Validation experiments on five healthy volunteers and further offline simulations showed that our adaptively guided search method needs only a relatively small number of stimuli to provide outcomes with good accuracy and precision. The automated method enables fast and user-independent optimization of stimulation parameters in research and clinical applications of TMS.Competing Interest StatementRJI is an advisor and a minority shareholder of Nexstim Plc.

    "abstract": "High dimensional linear regression problems are often fitted using Lasso approaches. Although the Lasso objective function is convex, it is not differentiable everywhere, making the use of gradient descent methods for minimization not straightforward. To avoid this technical issue, we apply Nesterov smoothing to the original (unsmoothed) Lasso objective function. We introduce a closed-form smoothed Lasso which preserves the convexity of the Lasso function, is uniformly close to the unsmoothed Lasso, and allows us to obtain closed-form derivatives everywhere for efficient and fast minimization via gradient descent. Our simulation studies are focused on polygenic risk scores using genetic data from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We compare accuracy and run-time of our approach to the current gold standard in the literature, the FISTA algorithm. Our results suggest that the proposed methodology provides estimates with equal or higher accuracy than the FISTA algorithm while having the same asymptotic runtime scaling. The proposed methodology is implemented in the R-package smoothedLasso, available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).",

    "abstract": "The blood brain barrier (BBB) and blood spinal cord barrier (BSCB) are highly specialised structures that limit molecule entry from the blood and maintain homeostasis within the central nervous system (CNS). BBB and BSCB breakdown are associated with multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Given the key role of neuroprotective barrier impairment in neurodegeneration, it is important to identify an effective quantitative method to assess barrier integrity in animal models. In the present study, we developed and validated a quantitative method for assessing BBB and BSCB integrity using sodium fluorescein, a compound that outperformed other fluorescent dyes. We demonstrated using this method that multiple CNS regions progressively increase in permeability in models of Huntingtons disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, while biphasic disruption occurred in a mouse model of Alzheimers disease with disease progression. Collectively, we report a quantitative fluorometric marker with validated reproducible experimental methods, that allows the effective assessment of BBB and BSCB integrity in animal models. This method could be useful to further the understanding of the contribution of these neuroprotective barriers to neurodegeneration processes.",

    "abstract": "Tigecycline and colistin are few of last-resort defenses used in anti-infection therapies against carbapenem-resistant bacterial pathogens. The successive emergence of plasmid-borne tet(X) tigecycline resistance mechanism and mobile colistin resistance (mcr) determinant, renders them clinically ineffective, posing a risky challenge to global public health. Here, we report that co-carriage of tet(X6) and mcr-1 gives co-resistance to both classes of antibiotics by a single plasmid in E. coli. Genomic analysis suggested that transposal transfer of mcr-1 proceeds into the plasmid pMS8345A, in which a new variant tet(X6) is neighbored with Class I integron. The structure-guided mutagenesis finely revealed the genetic determinants of Tet(X6) in the context of phenotypic tigecycline resistance. The combined evidence in vitro and in vivo demonstrated its enzymatic action of Tet(X6) in the destruction of tigecycline. The presence of Tet(X6) (and/or MCR-1) robustly prevents the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by tigecycline (and/or colistin). Unlike that mcr-1 exerts fitness cost in E. coli, tet(X6) does not. In the tet(X6)-positive strain that co-harbors mcr-1, tigecycline resistance is independently of colistin resistance caused by MCR-1-mediated lipid A remodeling, and vice versa. Co-production of Tet(X6) and MCR-1 gives no synergistic delayed growth of the recipient E. coli. Similar to that MCR-1 behaves in the infection model of G. mellonella, Tet(X6) renders the treatment of tigecycline ineffective. Therefore, co-transfer of such two AMR genes is of great concern in the context of \"one health\" comprising environmental/animal/human sectors, and heightened efforts are required to monitor its dissemination.\n\nAuthor summaryWe report that tet(X6), a new tigecycline resistance gene, is co-carried with the other resistance gene mcr-1 by a single plasmid. Not only have we finely mapped genetic determinants of tet(X6), but also revealed its biochemical action of tigecycline destruction. Crosstalk of Tet(X6) with MCR-1 is addressed. Tet(X6) tigecycline resistance is independently of MCR-1 colistin resistance, and vice versa. Similar to MCR-1 that renders colistin clinically ineffective, Tet(X6) leads to the failure of tigecycline treatment in the infection model of G. mellonella. This study extends mechanistic understanding mechanism and interplay of Tet(X6) and MCR-1, coproduced by a single plasmid. It also heightens the need to prevent rapid and large-scaled spread of AMR.",

    "abstract": "Lysine lactoylation is a recently described protein post-translational modification (PTM). However, the biochemical pathways responsible for this acylation remain unclear. Two metabolite-dependent mechanisms have been proposed: enzymatic histone lysine lactoylation derived from lactoyl-coenzyme A (lactoyl-CoA, also termed lactyl-CoA), and non-enzymatic lysine lactoylation resulting from acyl-transfer via lactoyl-glutathione. While the former has precedent in the form of enzyme-catalyzed lysine acylation, the lactoyl-CoA metabolite has not been previously quantified in mammalian systems. Here we use liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) together with a synthetic standard to detect and validate the presence of lactoyl-CoA in cell and tissue samples. Conducting a retrospective analysis of data from previously analyzed samples revealed the presence of lactoyl-CoA in diverse cell and tissue contexts. In addition, we describe a biosynthetic route to generate 13C3 15N1 -isotopically-labeled lactoyl-CoA, providing a co-eluting internal standard for analysis of this metabolite. We estimate lactoyl-CoA concentrations of 1.14x10-8 pmol/cell in cell culture and 0.0172 pmol/mg tissue wet weight in mouse heart. These levels are similar to crotonyl-CoA, but between 20-350 times lower than predominant acyl-CoAs such as acetyl-, propionyl-, and succinyl-CoA. Overall our studies provide the first quantitative measurements of lactoyl-CoA and provide a methodological foundation for the interrogation of this novel metabolite in biology and disease.\n\nHighlights- Detection of lactoyl-CoA at picomole concentrations across tissues and cells\n- Lactoyl-CoA was detected at concentrations similar to crontonyl-CoA within HepG2 cells\n- Isotopically labeled 13C315N1-lactoyl-CoA can be prepared by SILEC",

    "abstract": "We study the structural ensembles of human chromosomes across different cell types. Using computer simulations, we generate cell-specific 3D chromosomal structures and compare them to recently published chromatin structures obtained through microscopy. We demonstrate using a combination of machine learning and polymer physics simulations that epigenetic information can be used to predict the structural ensembles of multiple human cell lines. The chromosomal structures obtained in silico are quantitatively consistent with those obtained through microscopy as well as DNA-DNA proximity ligation assays. Theory predicts that chromosome structures are fluid and can only be described by an ensemble, which is consistent with the observation that chromosomes exhibit no unique fold. Nevertheless, our analysis of both structures from simulation and microscopy reveals that short segments of chromatin make transitions between a closed conformation and an open dumbbell conformation. This conformational transition appears to be consistent with a two-state process with an effective free energy cost of about four times the effective information theoretic temperature. Finally, we study the conformational changes associated with the switching of genomic compartments observed in human cell lines. Genetically identical but epigenetically distinct cell types appear to rearrange their respective structural ensembles to expose segments of transcriptionally active chromatin, belonging to the A genomic compartment, towards the surface of the chromosome, while inactive segments, belonging to the B compartment, move to the interior. The formation of genomic compartments resembles hydrophobic collapse in protein folding, with the aggregation of denser and predominantly inactive chromatin driving the positioning of active chromatin toward the surface of individual chromosomal territories.",

However, the identification of endogenous or exogenous bacteria conferring such protection is often hindered by the complexity of host microbial communities. Here, we used zebrafish and the fish pathogen Flavobacterium columnare as a model system to study the determinants of microbiota-associated colonization resistance. We compared infection susceptibility in germ-free, conventional and re-conventionalized larvae and showed that a consortium of 10 culturable bacterial species are sufficient to protect zebrafish. Whereas survival to F. columnare infection does not rely on host innate immunity, we used antibiotic dysbiosis to alter zebrafish microbiota composition, leading to the identification of two different protection strategies. We first identified that the bacterium Chryseobacterium massiliae individually protects both larvae and adult zebrafish. We also showed that an assembly of 9 endogenous zebrafish species that do not otherwise protect individually confer a community-level resistance to infection. Our study therefore provides a rational approach to identify key endogenous protecting bacteria and promising candidates to engineer resilient microbial communities. It also shows how direct experimental analysis of colonization resistance in low-complexity in vivo models can reveal unsuspected ecological strategies at play in microbiota-based protection against pathogens.",

We obtained 42 million paired-end reads that were annotated against sixteen reference databases using two ENVO ontologies, prior to {beta}-diversities studies. We identified 37 phyla, 65 classes and 132 orders of micro-organisms. Bacteria dominated the microbiome and comprised of 28 phyla, 42 classes and 92 orders, conveying substrates versatility in the treatments. Though, fungi and Archaea comprised of only 5 phyla, the fungi were richer; suggesting the importance of hydrolysis and fermentation in biogas production systems. High {beta}-diversity within the taxa was largely linked to communities metabolic capabilities. Clostridiales and Bacteroidales, the most prevalent guilds, metabolize organic macromolecules. The identified affiliates of Cytophagales, Alteromonadales, Flavobacteriales, Fusobacteriales, Deferribacterales, Elusimicrobiales, Chlamydiales, Synergistales to mention but few, also catabolize macromolecules into smaller substrates to conserve energy. Furthermore,{delta} -Proteobacteria, Gloeobacteria and Clostridia affiliates syntrophically regulate PH2 and reduce metal to provide reducing equivalents. Methanomicrobiales and other Methanomicrobia species were the most prevalence Archaea, converting formate, CO2(g), acetate and methylated substrates into CH4(g). Thermococci, Thermoplasmata and Thermoprotei were among the sulfur and other metal reducing Archaea that contributed to redox balancing and other metabolism within treatments. Eukaryotes, mainly fungi were the least abundant guild, comprised largely Ascomycota and Basidiomycota species. Chytridiomycetes, Blastocladiomycetes and Mortierellomycetes were among the rare species, suggesting their metabolic and substrates limitations. Generally, we observed that environmental and treatment perturbations influenced communities abundance, {beta}-diversity and reactor performance largely through stochastic effect. The study of the diversity of the biogas microbiomes over wide environmental variables and the productivity of biogas reactor systems has provided insights into better management strategies that may ameliorate biochemical limitations to effective biogas production.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe failure of biochemical reactions in biogas producing systems is a common problem and results from poor functioning of the inhabiting micro-organisms. A poor understanding of the global diversities of these micro-organisms and lack of information on the link between environmental variables, biogas production, and community composition, contrains the development of strategies that can ameliorate these biochemical issues. We have integrated sequencing-by-synthesis technology and intensive computational approaches to reveal metacommunities in the studied reactor treatments. The identified communities were compared with the treatments phenotypic and environmental data in an attempt to fill the existing knowledge gaps on biogas microbiomes and their production capacities. We present 132 biogas taxonomic profiles systematically and comparatively, linking the abundance with the identified environmental variables. The local composition of microbiome and variations in abundance were also linked to the observed differences in biogas productivity, suggesting the possible cause of the observed variations. The detailed information presented in this study can aid in the genetic manipulation or formulation of optimal microbial ratios to improve their effectiveness in biogas production.",

The ability to experimentally generate drug response data has accelerated. However, this data is typically quantified by a summary statistic from a best-fit dose response curve, whilst neglecting the uncertainty of the curve fit and the potential variability in the raw readouts. Here, we model the experimental variance using Gaussian Processes, and subsequently, leverage this uncertainty for identifying associated biomarkers with a new statistical framework based on Bayesian testing. Applied to the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer, in vitro screening data on 265 compounds across 1,074 cell lines, our uncertainty models identified 24 clinically established drug response biomarkers, and in addition provided evidence for 6 novel biomarkers. We validated our uncertainty estimates with an additional drug screen of 26 drugs, 10 cell lines with 8 to 9 replicates. Our method is applicable to drug high-throughput screens without replicates, and enables robust biomarker discovery for new cancer therapies.",

    "abstract": "The human gut microbiome includes beneficial, commensal and pathogenic bacteria that possess antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes that exchange these predominantly through conjugative plasmids. Escherichia coli is a significant component of the gastrointestinal microbiome and is typically non-pathogenic in this niche. In contrast, extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) including ST131 may occupy other environments like the urinary tract or bloodstream where they express genes enabling AMR and host cell adhesion like type 1 fimbriae. The extent to which commensal E. coli and uropathogenic ExPEC ST131 share AMR genes remains understudied at a genomic level, and here we examined this using a preterm infant resistome. Here, individual ST131 had small differences in AMR gene content relative to a larger shared resistome. Comparisons with a range of plasmids common in ST131 showed that AMR gene composition was driven by conjugation, recombination and mobile genetic elements. Plasmid pEK499 had extended regions in most ST131 Clade C isolates, and it had evidence of a co-evolutionary signal based on protein-level interactions with chromosomal gene products, as did pEK204 that had a type IV fimbrial pil operon. ST131 possessed extensive diversity of selective type 1, type IV, P and F17-like fimbriae genes that was highest in subclade C2. The structure and composition of AMR genes, plasmids and fimbriae vary widely in ST131 Clade C and this may mediate pathogenicity and infection outcomes.\n\nData SummaryThe following files are available on the FigShare project \"Plasmids_ST131_resistome_2020\" :\n\nO_LI The set of 794 AMR genes derived from [74] are available (with their protein sequence translation) at FigShare at doi: dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.11961402.\nC_LIO_LI The AMR gene profiles per sample determined by their BLAST sequence similarity results against CARD are available at FigShare at doi: dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.11961612.

    "abstract": "The accurate prediction of new interactions between drugs is important for avoiding unknown (mild or severe) adverse reactions to drug combinations. The development of effective in silico methods for evaluating drug interactions based on gene expression data requires an understanding of how various drugs alter gene expression. Current computational methods for the prediction of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) utilize data for known DDIs to predict unknown interactions. However, these methods are limited in the absence of known predictive DDIs. To improve DDIs interpretation, a recent study has demonstrated strong non-linear (i.e., dosedependent) effects of DDIs. In this study, we present a new unsupervised learning approach involving tensor decomposition (TD)-based unsupervised feature extraction (FE) in 3D. We utilize our approach to reanalyze available gene expression profiles for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that non-linearity is possible, even for single drugs. Thus, non-linear dose-dependence cannot always be attributed to DDIs. Our analysis provides a basis for the design of effective methods for evaluating DDIs.",

We describe the construction of a functional CCM in a non-native host, achieved by expressing genes from an autotrophic bacterium in an engineered E. coli strain. Expression of 20 CCM genes enabled E. coli to grow by fixing CO2 from ambient air into biomass, with growth depending on CCM components. Bacterial CCMs are therefore genetically compact and readily transplanted, rationalizing their presence in diverse bacteria. Reconstitution enabled genetic experiments refining our understanding of the CCM, thereby laying the groundwork for deeper study and engineering of the cell biology supporting CO2 assimilation in diverse organisms.One Sentence Summary A bacterial CO2 concentrating mechanism enables E. coli to fix CO2 from ambient air.Competing Interest StatementD.F.S. is a co-founder of Scribe Therapeutics and a scientific advisory board member of Scribe Therapeutics and Mammoth Biosciences.

    "abstract": "The inflammasome is an essential component of host defense against intracellular bacterial pathogens, such as Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of the severe pneumonia Legionnaires disease. Inflammasome activation leads to recruitment and activation of caspases, which promote IL-1 family cytokine release and pyroptosis. In mice, interferon (IFN) signaling promotes inflammasome responses against L. pneumophila, in part through the functions of a family of IFN-inducible GTPases known as guanylate binding proteins (GBPs) (1). Within murine macrophages, IFN signaling promotes rupture of the L. pneumophila-containing vacuole (LCV), whereas GBPs are dispensable for vacuole rupture. Instead, GBPs facilitate the lysis of cytosol-exposed L. pneumophila. In contrast to mouse GBPs, the functions of human GBPs in inflammasome responses to L. pneumophila are poorly understood. Here, we show that IFN-{gamma} promotes caspase-1, caspase-4, and caspase-5 inflammasome activation during L. pneumophila infection and upregulates GBP expression in primary human macrophages. We find that human GBP1 is important for maximal IFN-{gamma}-driven inflammasome responses to L. pneumophila. Furthermore, IFN-{gamma} signaling promotes the rupture of LCVs. Intriguingly, in contrast to murine GBPs, human GBP1 targets the LCV in a T4SS-dependent manner and promotes vacuolar lysis, resulting in increased bacterial access to the host cell cytosol. Our findings show a key role for human GBP1 in targeting and disrupting pathogen-containing vacuoles and reveal mechanistic differences in how mouse and human GBPs promote inflammasome responses to L. pneumophila.",

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics can identify more than 10,000 phosphorylated sites in a single experiment. But, despite the fact that enormous phosphosite information has been accumulated in public repositories, protein kinase-substrate relationships remain largely unknown. Here, we describe a method to identify endogenous substrates of kinases by means of proximity labeling. We used a proximity-dependent biotin identification approach, called BioID, in combination with kinase-perturbed phosphoproteomics profiling and phosphorylation sequence motifs derived from in vitro kinase assay to find molecules that interact with a target kinase, that show altered phosphorylation in response to kinase perturbation, and that are directly phosphorylated by the kinase in vitro; i.e., endogenous kinase substrates. Application of this methodology to casein kinase 2 (CK2) and protein kinase A (PKA) identified 33 and 52 putative substrates, respectively. We also show that known cancer-associated missense mutations near phosphosites of substrates affect phosphorylation by CK2 or PKA, and thus might alter downstream signaling in cancer cells bearing these mutations.\n\nThis study extends our knowledge of kinase-substrate networks by proposing a new large-scale approach to identify endogenous substrates of kinases.",

    "abstract": "Sensitivity and robustness appear to be contrasting concepts. However, natural proteins are robust enough to tolerate random mutations, meanwhile be susceptible enough to sense environmental signals, exhibiting both high functional sensitivity (i.e., plasticity) and mutational robustness. Uncovering how these two aspects are compatible is a fundamental question in the protein dynamics and genotype-phenotype relation. In this work, a general framework is established to analyze the dynamics of protein systems under both external and internal perturbations. We introduce fluctuation entropy for the functional sensitivity and the spectrum entropy for the mutational robustness. The compatibility of sensitivity and robustness is analyzed by the optimization of two entropies, which leads to the power-law vibration spectrum of proteins. These power-law behaviors are confirmed extensively by protein data, as a hallmark of criticality. Moreover, the dependence of functional sensitivity and mutational robustness on the protein size suggests a general evolutionary constraint for proteins with different chain lengths. This framework can also establish a general link of the criticality with robustness-plasticity compatibility, both of which are ubiquitous features in biological systems.",

    "abstract": "Despite five decades of clinical investigations, there is currently no effective treatment for children diagnosed with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG). We now understand that DIPGs share the same histone 3 mutation and fatal prognosis as other diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs), which led to the introduction of a new entity referred to as DMG, H3 K27M mutant. Indeed, therapeutics indicated for other brain neoplasms have proven ineffective for DIPGs. We posit that by using a polypharmacological approach to determine drug combinations that target distinct mechanistic pathways of DIPG, it is more likely that an efficacious treatment will be developed. We predict monodrug therapies using a link prediction model trained on various embeddings of a drug-disease regulatory network and physicochemical properties of small molecules and proteins. We validate the in silico predictions by performing cell viability assays on patient-derived cell cultures for notable therapeutics. Using FDA-approved drugs as a proxy for viability of a drug pair for combinatorial use, we develop a model to predict the synergism of the relationship between drug pairs. Finally, we calculate the transitive probability that a drug pair contains drugs that individually regulate DIPG, are blood-brain barrier penetrant, and the drug pair are suitable for combined use. We find only moderate agreement between computational predictions and experimental results for both monodrug and multidrug therapies, we believe due to the heterogeneity of the disease, the difficulties of modelling brain permeability, and an inherent literature bias in the knowledge graph. Such challenges need to be overcome to develop an efficacious therapy for this disease.",

In the present study of 42 healthy volunteers, we investigated the effects of selective REM sleep suppression (REMS) on general affect, as well as on feelings of social exclusion, emotion regulation, and their neural underpinnings. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging we show that REMS increases amygdala responses to experimental social exclusion, as well as negative affect on the morning following sleep deprivation. There was no evidence that emotional responses to experimentally induced social exclusion or their regulation using cognitive reappraisal were impacted by diminished REM sleep. Our findings indicate that general affect and amygdala activity depend on REM sleep, while specific emotional experiences possibly rely on additional psychological processes and neural systems that are less readily influenced by REMS.",

Probability of contracting this highly contagious infection is similar across age groups but disease severity and fatality among aged patients with or without comorbidities are higher. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 infection may augment aging-related gene expression alterations resulting in severe outcomes in elderly patients.\n\nMethodologyWe performed a comparative analysis of publicly available transcriptome data from Broncho Alveolar Lavage Fluid (BALF)/lung/blood of healthy aging group with i) COVID-19 patients; and ii) data of host genes interacting with SARS-CoV-2 proteins.\n\nResultsWe observed i) a significant overlap of gene expression profiles of patients BALF and blood with lung and blood of the healthy group respectively; ii) a more pronounced overlap in blood compared to lung; and iii) a similar overlap between host genes interacting with SARS-CoV-2 and aging blood transcriptome.\n\nConclusionsPathway enrichment analysis of overlapping gene sets suggests that infection alters expression of genes already dysregulated in the elderly, which together may lead to poor prognosis. eQTLs in these genes may also confer poor outcome in young patients worsening with age and co-morbidities. Furthermore, the pronounced overlap observed in blood may explain clinical symptoms including blood clots, strokes, heart attack, multi-organ failure etc. in severe cases.

Here we replicate previously published culturing and extraction procedures and couple them with compositional analysis to determine whether the mucilage produced from Plantago ovata and P. lanceolata calli are similar to seed mucilage. Our monosaccharide profiling and microscopy show that, while calli derived from either seedling hypocotyls or roots yield more material than seeds using the same extraction techniques, the majority of extract mass is cellular debris. Debris polysaccharide composition was significantly different to seed mucilage from both species. Plant tissue culture as an alternative source of high yields of useful mucilage polysaccharides, at least by these and similar methods, is likely to not be possible.",

Cold hardiness of field-collected larvae was determined using three common metrics of cold-induced physiological thresholds: the supercooling point (SCP), critical thermal minimum (CTmin), and survival following cold exposure. P. cresphontes larvae in autumn have a CTmin of 2.14{degrees}C, and were determined to be tolerant of chilling. These larvae have a SCP of -6.6{degrees}C and can survive prolonged exposure to -2{degrees}C. They generally die, however, at temperatures below their SCP (-8{degrees}C), suggesting they are chill tolerant or modestly freeze avoidant. Using this information, we examined the importance of low temperatures at a broad scale, by comparing species distribution models of P. cresphontes based only on environmental data derived from other sources to models that also included the cold tolerance parameters generated experimentally. Our modelling revealed that growing degree-days and precipitation best predicted the distribution of P. cresphontes, while the cold tolerance variables did not explain much variation in habitat suitability. As such, the modelling results were consistent with our experimental results: low temperatures in autumn are unlikely to limit the distribution of P. cresphontes. Further investigation into the ecological relevance of the physiological thresholds determined here will help determine how climate limits the distribution of P. cresphontes. Understanding the factors that limit species distributions is key to predicting how climate change will drive species range shifts.",

Here, we study the reversible, pressure-induced dissociation of a natural protein nanocage, E. coli bacterioferritin (Bfr), using synchrotron radiation small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and circular dichroism (CD). We demonstrate that hydrostatic pressures of 450 MPa are sufficient to completely dissociate the Bfr icositetramer into protein dimers, and the reversibility and kinetics of the reassembly process can be controlled by selecting appropriate buffer conditions. We also demonstrate that the heme B prosthetic group present at the subunit dimer interface influences the stability and pressure lability of the cage, despite its location being discrete from the inter-dimer interface that is key to cage assembly. This indicates a major cage-stabilising role for heme within this family of ferritins.",

FSL-MRS provides spectroscopic data conversion, pre-processing, spectral simulation, fitting, quantitation and visualisation.\n\nMethodsFSL-MRS is modular. FSL-MRS programs operate on data in a standard format (NIfTI) capable of storing single voxel and multi-voxel spectroscopy, including spatial orientation information.\n\nFSL-MRS includes tools for pre-processing of raw spectroscopy data, including coil-combination, frequency and phase alignment, and filtering. A density matrix simulation program is supplied for generation of basis spectra from simple text-based descriptions of pulse sequences.\n\nFitting is based on linear combination of basis spectra and implements Markov chain Monte Carlo optimisation for the estimation of the full posterior distribution of metabolite concentrations. Validation of the fitting is carried out on independently created simulated data, phantom data, and three in vivo human datasets (257 SVS and 8 MRSI datasets) at 3T and 7T.\n\nInteractive HTML reports are automatically generated by processing and fitting stages of the toolbox. FSL-MRS can be used on the command line or interactively in the Python language.\n\nResultsValidation of the fitting shows low error in simulation (median error 11.9%) and in phantom (3.4%). Average correlation between a third-party toolbox (LCModel) and FSL-MRS was high (0.53-0.81) in all three in vivo datasets.\n\nConclusionFSL-MRS is designed to be flexible and extensible to new forms of spectroscopic acquisitions. Custom fitting models can be specified within the framework for dynamic or multi-voxel spectroscopy. FSL-MRS is available as part of the FMRIB Software Library.",

We, therefore, interrogated gene expression profiles of SLE synovium to gain insight into the nature of lupus arthritis (LA), using osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as comparators. Knee synovia from SLE, OA, and RA patients were analyzed for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and also by Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to identify modules of highly co-expressed genes. Genes upregulated and/or co-expressed in LA revealed numerous immune/inflammatory cells dominated by a myeloid phenotype, whereas OA was characteristic of fibroblasts and RA of T- and B-cells. Upstream regulator analysis identified CD40L and inflammatory cytokines as drivers of the LA gene expression profile. Genes governing trafficking of immune cells into the synovium by chemokines were identified, but not in situ generation of germinal centers. GSVA confirmed activation of specific myeloid and lymphoid cell types in LA. Numerous therapies were predicted to target LA, including TNF, NF{kappa}B, MAPK, and CDK inhibitors. Detailed gene expression analysis identified a unique pattern of cellular components and physiologic pathways operative in LA, as well as drugs potentially able to target this common manifestation of SLE.",

    "abstract": "It is well recognized that cognitive output fluctuates surrounding sleep. Such fluctuations are rarely investigated in subjects daily living, partially due to the inaccessibility of sleep laboratory technology and cognitive testing. Here we leverage the continuous and long-term smartphone touchscreen interaction logs to study the patterns of cognitive output surrounding sleep and contrasted these to the patterns underlying physical activity captured from wrist-worn actigraphy. According to spectral density analysis, both cognitive and physical activity was dominated by diurnal ([~]24 h) and infra-radian ([~]7 days) rhythms. However, these rhythms differed in a domain-specific manner. The proxy measures of cognitive performance - tapping speed, unlocking speed, and app locating speed - contained lower-powered diurnal rhythm than physical activity. Still, the amount of smartphone usage showed the strongest diurnal rhythm - even when compared to the ambient luminescence levels experienced according to actigraphy. Interestingly, the cognitive rhythms were not in sync with physical activity, as cognitive measures peaked later in the day and on weekdays rather than weekends. The difference between cognitive and physical activity became vivid during bedtime and subjects routinely interacted with their smartphones during the actigraphy labelled sleep period. The cognitive measures in this period were worse in comparison to the hour before or after sleep. Therefore, smartphones can seamlessly capture the dynamic fluctuations in cognitive output including during spontaneous awakenings. We conclude that the rhythms underlying cognitive activity in the real world are distinct from physical activity and this discord may be a hallmark of modern human behaviour.",

Organoid and ALI cultures were used to investigate functional properties of basal cell subtypes.\n\nMeasurements and Main ResultsWe found that basal cells included multipotent and secretory primed subsets in control adult lung tissue. Secretory primed basal cells include an overlapping molecular signature with basal cells obtained from distal lung tissue of IPF lungs. We confirmed that NOTCH2 maintains undifferentiated basal cells and restrict basal-to-ciliated differentiation, and present evidence that NOTCH3 functions to restrain secretory differentiation.\n\nConclusionsBasal cells are dynamically regulated in disease and are specifically biased towards expansion of the secretory primed basal cell subset in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Modulation of basal cell plasticity may represent a relevant target for therapeutic intervention in IPF.",

    "abstract": "Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) is one of the most important crops worldwide, constituting a major source of protein and edible oil. Gene co-expression networks (GCN) have been extensively used to study transcriptional regulation and evolution of genes and genomes. Here, we report a soybean GCN using 1,284 publicly available RNA-Seq samples from 15 distinct tissues. We found modules that are differentially regulated in specific tissues, comprising processes such as photosynthesis, gluconeogenesis, lignin metabolism, and response to biotic stress. We identified transcription factors among intramodular hubs, which probably integrate different pathways and shape the transcriptional landscape in different conditions. The top hubs for each module tend to encode proteins with critical roles, such as succinate dehydrogenase and RNA polymerase subunits. Importantly, gene essentiality was strongly correlated with degree centrality and essential hubs enriched in genes involved in nucleic acids metabolism and regulation of cell replication. By using a using a guilt-by-association approach, we predicted functions for 93 of 106 hubs without functional description in soybean. Most of the duplicated genes had different transcriptional profiles, supporting their functional divergence, although paralogs originating from whole-genome duplications (WGD) are more often preserved in the same module than those from other mechanisms. Together, our results highlight the importance of GCN analysis in unraveling key functional aspects of the soybean genome, in particular those associated with hub genes and WGD events.",

However, much of this understanding is derived from postmortem analyses of molecular, morphological, physiological and behavioral changes at fixed time points. Neural signatures of an ongoing stressful experience in the intact brain of awake animals and their links to later hippocampal dysfunction remain poorly understood. Here we used in vivo tetrode recordings to analyze the dynamic impact of 10 days of immobilization stress on neuronal activity in area CA1 of mice. Unexpectedly, there was a net decrease in pyramidal cell activity in stressed animals. Although these results suggest a lack of stress-induced hyperexcitability, more detailed analysis revealed that a greater fraction of spikes occurred specifically during sharp-wave ripples, resulting in an increase in neuronal synchrony. After repeated stress some of these alterations were visible during rest even in the absence of stress. These findings offer new insights into stress-induced alterations in ripple-spike interactions and mechanisms through which chronic stress may interfere with subsequent information processing.",

    "abstract": "Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding for biodiversity monitoring is a critical technical advance. Both aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity information can be detected in riverine water eDNA. However, it remains unverified whether riverine water eDNA can be used to simultaneously monitor aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity. Our specific objective was to assess the effectiveness of monitoring aquatic and riparian biodiversity using riverine water eDNA. We proposed that the monitoring effectiveness (the proportion of aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity information detected by riverine water eDNA samples) could be approximated by the transportation effectiveness of land-to-river and upstream-to-downstream biodiversity information flow. We conducted a case study in a watershed on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and estimated the effectiveness of using riverine water eDNA to monitor aquatic and riparian biodiversity based on comparing the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and species assemblages of three taxonomic communities detected in riverine water eDNA samples and riparian soil eDNA samples in spring, summer, and autumn. The aquatic and riparian biodiversity of a watershed on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau could be simultaneously effectively monitored using riverine water eDNA on summer or autumn rainy days. Monitoring bacterial communities was more efficient than monitoring eukaryotic communities. On summer rainy days, 43%-76% of riparian species could be detected in water eDNA samples, 92%-99% of upstream species could be detected in a 1-km downstream eDNA sample, and more than 50% of dead bioinformation (i.e., the bioinformation labeling the biological material without life activity and fertility) could be monitored 4-6 km downstream for eukaryotes and 13-19 km for bacteria. We encourage more studies on the monitoring effectiveness for each taxonomic community in other watersheds with different environmental conditions. We believe that in future ecological research, conservation and management, we could efficiently monitor and assess the aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity by simply using riverine water eDNA samples.",

Here, we have systematically studied how the four types of associative memories (short- and long-term memories, each formed using positive and negative associations) are encoded within the compact neural network of C. elegans worms. Interestingly, short-term, but not long-term, memories are evident in the sensory system. Long-term memories are relegated to inner layers of the network, allowing the sensory system to resume innate functionality. Furthermore, a small set of sensory neurons is allocated for coding short-term memories, a design that can increase memory capacity and limit non-innate behavioral responses. Notably, individual sensory neurons may code for the conditioned stimulus or the experience valence. Interneurons integrate these information to modulate animal behavior upon memory reactivation. This comprehensive study reveals basic principles by which memories are encoded within a neural network, and highlights the central roles of sensory neurons in memory formation.",

We first demonstrate that low-ranking teams commit more fouls than they receive in top-tier soccer, ice hockey, and basketball mens leagues. We replicate this effect in the laboratory, showing that male participants deliver louder sound blasts to a rival when placed in a low-status position. Using neuroimaging, we characterize brain activity patterns that encode competitive status as well as those that facilitate status-dependent aggression in healthy young men. These analyses reveal three key findings. First, anterior hippocampus and striatum contain multivariate representations of competitive status. Second, interindividual differences in status-dependent aggression are linked with a sharper status differentiation in the striatum and with greater reactivity to status-enhancing victories in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Third, activity in ventromedial, ventrolateral, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is associated with trial-wise increases in status-dependent aggressive behavior. Taken together, our results run counter to narratives glorifying aggression in competitive situations. Rather, we show that those in the lower ranks of skill-based hierarchies are more likely to behave aggressively and identify the potential neural basis of this phenomenon.",

Metabolic profiling was utilized to compare tissues of Euphorbia species collected in various regions. The metabolic variation of latexes was much more limited than that of other organs. In all of the species, the levels of polyisoprenes and terpenoids were found to be much higher in latexes than in leaves and roots. Polyisoprenes were also observed to physically delay the contact and growth of pathogens with plant tissues. A secondary barrier composed of terpenes and, in particular, 24-methylenecycloartanol, exhibited antifungal activity. These results, together with the known roles of the enzymes also present in latexes, demonstrate that they are part of a cooperative defense system that comprises both biochemical and physical elements.",

Here, we establish a new paradigm for interrogating brain-periphery interactions by leveraging zebrafish for its unparalleled access to the intact whole animal for in vivo analysis in real time after triggering focal brain inflammation. We reveal that drainage of inflammatory macromolecules from the brain led to a strikingly robust peripheral infiltration of macrophages into the liver independent of Kupffer cells. We further demonstrate that this macrophage recruitment requires signaling from the cytokine IL-34, Toll-like receptor adaptor protein MyD88, and neutrophils. These results highlight the ability for circulation of brain-derived substances to serve as a rapid mode of communication from brain to the liver.

    "abstract": "Research has described several features shared between musical rhythm and speech or language, and experimental studies consistently show associations between performance on tasks in the two domains as well as impaired rhythm processing in children with language disorders. Motivated by these results, in the current study our first aim was to explore whether the activation of the shared system underlying rhythm and language processing with a regular musical rhythm can improve subsequent grammatical processing in preschool-aged Hungarianspeaking children with and without Developmental Language Disorder (DLD). Second, we investigated whether rhythmic priming is specific to grammar processing by assessing priming in two additional domains: a linguistic but non-grammatical task (picture naming) and a non-linguistic task (nonverbal Stroop task). Third, to confirm that the rhythmic priming effect originates from the facilitating effect of the regular rhythm and not the negative effect of the control condition, we added a third condition, silence, for all the three tasks. Both groups of children showed better performance on the grammaticality judgment task in the regular compared to both the irregular and the silent conditions but no such effect appeared in the non-grammatical and non-linguistic tasks. These results suggest that 1) rhythmic priming can improve grammatical processing in Hungarian, a language with complex morphosyntax, both in children with and without DLD, 2) the effect is specific to grammar and 3) is a result of the facilitating effect of the regular rhythm.Research Highlights6-year-old Hungarian-speaking children with and without Developmental Language Disorder perform better on a grammatical task subsequent to exposure to a regular rhythm vs. an irregular rhythm/silenceThe effect of regular rhythm is specific: it improves performance on a grammatical task but not on a word retrieval or a non-linguistic taskDifference between performance following regular vs. irregular rhythm originates from the facilitating effect of the regular rhythm (not the negative effect of the irregular rhythm)The results highlight the importance of rhythm in speech processing, and point towards a possible intervention tool in language disordersCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen is an essential macronutrient and its availability in soil plays a critical role in plant growth, development and impacts agricultural productivity. Plants have evolved different strategies to sense and respond to heterogeneous nitrogen distribution. Modulating root system architecture, including primary root growth and branching, is among the most essential plant adaptions to ensure adequate nitrogen acquisition. However, the immediate molecular pathways coordinating the adjustment of root growth in response to varying nitrogen sources are poorly understood. Here, using a combination of physiological, live in vivo high- and super resolution imaging, we describe a novel adaptation strategy of root growth on available nitrogen source. We show that growth, i.e. tissue-specific cell division and elongation rates are fine-tuned by modulating auxin flux within and between tissues. Changes in auxin redistribution are achieved by nitrogen source dependent post-translational modification of PIN2, a major auxin efflux carrier, at an uncharacterized, evolutionary conserved phosphosite. Further, we generate a computer model based on our results which successfully recapitulate our experimental observations and creates new predictions that could broaden our understanding of root growth mechanisms in the dynamic environment.",

    "abstract": "Vaccines are urgently needed to combat the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and testing of candidate vaccines in an appropriate non-human primate (NHP) model is a critical step in the process. Infection of African green monkeys (AGM) with a low passage human isolate of SARS-CoV-2 by aerosol or mucosal exposure resulted in mild clinical infection with a transient decrease in lung tidal volume. Imaging with human clinical-grade 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) co-registered with computed tomography (CT) revealed pulmonary lesions at 4 days post-infection (dpi) that resolved over time. Infectious virus was shed from both respiratory and gastrointestinal (GI) tracts in all animals in a biphasic manner, first between 2-7 dpi followed by a recrudescence at 14-21 dpi. Viral RNA (vRNA) was found throughout both respiratory and gastrointestinal systems at necropsy with higher levels of vRNA found within the GI tract tissues. All animals seroconverted simultaneously for IgM and IgG, which has also been documented in human COVID-19 cases. Young AGM represent an excellent species to study mild/subclinical COVID-19 disease and have shed light on unknown aspects of long-term virus shedding. They are ideally suited for preclinical evaluation of candidate vaccines and therapeutic interventions.\n\nOne Sentence SummarySubclinical infection of African green monkeys infected with SARS-CoV-2 results in prolonged shedding of infectious virus from both respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has been ongoing since its onset in late November 2019 in Wuhan, China. Understanding and monitoring the genetic evolution of the virus, its geographical characteristics, and its stability are particularly important for controlling the spread of the disease and especially for the development of a universal vaccine covering all circulating strains. From this perspective, we analyzed 30,983 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 79 countries located in the six continents and collected from December 24, 2019, to May 13, 2020, according to the GISAID database. Our analysis revealed the presence of 3,206 variant sites, with a uniform distribution of mutation types in different geographic areas. Remarkably, a low frequency of recurrent mutations has been observed; only 169 mutations (5.27%) had a prevalence greater than 1% of genomes. Nevertheless, fourteen non-synonymous hotspot mutations (> 10%) have been identified at different locations along the viral genome; eight in ORF1ab polyprotein (in nsp2, nsp3, transmembrane domain, RdRp, helicase, exonuclease, and endoribonuclease), three in nucleocapsid protein and one in each of three proteins: spike, ORF3a, and ORF8. Moreover, 36 non-synonymous mutations were identified in the RBD of the spike protein with a low prevalence (<1%) across all genomes, of which only four could potentially enhance the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the human ACE2 receptor. These results along with mutational frequency dissimilarity and intra-genomic divergence of SARS-CoV-2 could indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 is not yet adapted to its host. Unlike the influenza virus or HIV viruses, the low mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 makes the development of an effective global vaccine very likely.",

    "abstract": "Fighting the COVID-19 epidemic summons deep understanding of the way SARS-CoV-2 taps into its host cell metabolic resources. We describe here the singular metabolic background that creates a bottleneck constraining coronaviruses to evolve towards likely attenuation in the long term. Cytidine triphosphate (CTP) is at the crossroad of the biosynthetic processes that allow the virus to multiply. This is because CTP is in demand for three essential steps. It is a building block of the virus genome, it is required for synthesis of the cytosine-based liponucleotide precursors of the viral envelope and, finally, it is a critical building block of the host transfer RNAs synthesis. The CCA 3-end of all the transfer RNAs required to translate the RNA genome and further transcripts into the proteins used to build active virus copies is not coded in the human genome. It must be synthesized de novo from CTP and ATP. Furthermore, intermediary metabolism is built on compulsory steps of synthesis and salvage of cytosine-based metabolites via uridine triphosphate (UTP) that keep limiting CTP availability. As a consequence, accidental replication errors tend to replace cytosine by uracil in the genome, unless recombination events allow the sequence to return to its ancestral sequences. We document some of the consequences of this situation in the function of viral proteins. We also highlight and provide a raison detre to viperin, an enzyme of innate antiviral immunity, which synthesizes 3-deoxy-3',4-didehydro-CTP (ddhCTP) as an extremely efficient antiviral nucleotide.",

IL-6 has been implicated as a cytokine negatively associated with survival after filovirus and coronavirus infection. However, IL-6 has also been shown to be an important mediator of innate immunity and important for the host response to an acute viral infection. Clinical studies are now being conducted by various researchers to evaluate the possible role of IL-6 blockers to improve outcomes in critically ill patients with CRS. Most of these studies involve the use of anti-IL-6R monoclonal antibodies (-IL-6R mAbs). We present data showing that direct neutralization of IL-6 with an -IL-6 mAb in a BALB/c Ebolavirus (EBOV) challenge model produced a statistically significant improvement in outcome compared with controls when administered within the first 24 hours of challenge and repeated every 72 hours. A similar effect was seen in mice treated with the same dose of -IL-6R mAb when the treatment was delayed 48 hrs post-challenge. These data suggest that direct neutralization of IL-6, early during the course of infection, may provide additional clinical benefits to IL-6 receptor blockade alone during treatment of patients with virus-induced CRS.",

    "abstract": "We combine sequence analysis, molecular dynamics and hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations to obtain the first description of the mechanism of reaction of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and of the inhibition of the enzyme by Remdesivir. Despite its evolutionary youth, the enzyme is highly optimized to have good fidelity in nucleotide incorporation and a good catalytic efficiency. Our simulations strongly suggest that Remdesivir triphosphate (the active form of drug) is incorporated into the nascent RNA replacing ATP, leading to a duplex RNA which is structurally very similar to an unmodified one. We did not detect any reason to explain the inhibitory activity of Remdesivir at the active site. Displacement of the nascent Remdesivir-containing RNA duplex along the exit channel of the enzyme can occur without evident steric clashes which would justify delayed inhibition. However, after the incorporation of three more nucleotides we found a hydrated Serine which is placed in a perfect arrangement to react through a Pinners reaction with the nitrile group of Remdesivir. Kinetic barriers for crosslinking and polymerization are similar suggesting a competition between polymerization and inhibition. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 mutational landscape and structural analysis of polymerases across different species support the proposed mechanism and suggest that virus has not explored yet resistance to Remdesivir inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Packaging of the chromatin within the nucleus serves as an important factor in the regulation of transcriptional output. However, information on chromatin architecture on nuclear scale in fully differentiated cells, under physiological conditions and in live organisms, is largely unavailable. Here, we imaged nuclei and chromatin in muscle fibers of live, intact Drosophila larvae. In contrast to the common view that chromatin is distributed throughout the nuclear volume, we show that the entire chromatin, including active and repressed regions, forms a peripheral layer underneath the nuclear lamina, leaving a chromatin-devoid compartment at the nucleus center. Importantly, visualization of nuclear compartmentalization required imaging of un-fixed nuclei embedded within their intrinsic tissue environment, with preserved nuclear volume. Upon fixation of similar muscle nuclei, we observed an average of three-fold reduction in nuclear volume caused by dehydration and evidenced by nuclear flattening. In these conditions, the peripheral chromatin layer was not detected anymore, demonstrating the importance of preserving native biophysical tissue environment. We further show that nuclear compartmentalization is sensitive to the levels of lamin C, since over-expression of lamin C-GFP in muscle nuclei resulted in detachment of the peripheral chromatin layer from the lamina and its collapse into the nuclear center. Computer simulations of chromatin distribution recapitulated the peripheral chromatin organization observed experimentally, when binding of lamina associated domains (LADs) was incorporated with chromatin self-attractive interactions. Reducing the number of LADs led to collapse of the chromatin, similarly to our observations following lamin C over-expression. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel mode of mesoscale organization of chromatin within the nucleus in a live organism, in which the chromatin forms a peripheral layer separated from the nuclear interior. This architecture may be essential for robust transcriptional regulation in fully differentiated cells.",

    "abstract": "Dravet syndrome (DS) is a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy that results from mutations in the Nav1.1 sodium channel encoded by SCN1A. Most known DS-causing mutations are in coding regions of SCN1A, but we recently identified several disease-associated SCN1A mutations in intron 20 that are within or near to a cryptic and evolutionarily conserved \"poison\" exon, 20N, whose inclusion leads to transcript degradation. However, it is not clear how these intron 20 variants alter SCN1A transcript processing or DS pathophysiology in an organismal context, nor is it clear how exon 20N is regulated in a tissue-specific and developmental context. We address those questions here by generating an animal model of our index case, NM_006920.4(SCN1A):c.3969+2451G>C, using gene editing to create the orthologous mutation in laboratory mice. Scn1a heterozygous knock-in (+/KI) mice exhibited an ~50% reduction in brain Scn1a mRNA and Nav1.1 protein levels, together with characteristics observed in other DS mouse models, including premature mortality, seizures, and hyperactivity. In brain tissue from adult Scn1a +/+ animals, quantitative RT-PCR assays indicated that ~1% of Scn1a mRNA included exon 20N, while brain tissue from Scn1a +/KI mice exhibited an ~5-fold increase in the extent of exon 20N inclusion. We investigated the extent of exon 20N inclusion in brain during normal fetal development in RNA-seq data and discovered that levels of inclusion were ~70% at E14.5, declining progressively to ~10% postnatally. A similar pattern exists for the homologous sodium channel Nav1.6, encoded by Scn8a. For both genes, there is an inverse relationship between the level of functional transcript and the extent of poison exon inclusion. Taken together, our findings suggest that poison exon usage by Scn1a and Scn8a is a strategy to regulate channel expression during normal brain development, and that mutations recapitulating a fetal-like pattern of splicing cause reduced channel expression and epileptic encephalopathy.\n\nAuthor SummaryDravet syndrome (DS) is a neurological disorder affecting approximately 1:15,700 Americans[1]. While most patients have a mutation in the SCN1A gene encoding Nav1.1 sodium channels, about 20% do not have a mutation identified by exome sequencing. Recently, we identified variants in intron 20N, a noncoding region of SCN1A, in some DS patients [2]. We predicted that these variants alter SCN1A transcript processing, decrease Nav1.1 function, and lead to DS pathophysiology via inclusion of exon 20N, a \"poison\" exon that leads to a premature stop codon. In this study, we generated a knock-in mouse model, Scn1a+/KI, of one of these variants, NM_006920.4(SCN1A):c.3969+2451G>C, which resides in a genomic region that is extremely conserved across vertebrate species. We found that Scn1a+/KI mice have reduced levels of Scn1a transcript and Nav1.1 protein and develop DS-related phenotypes. Consistent with the poison exon hypothesis, transcripts from brains of Scn1a+/KI mice showed elevated rates of Scn1a exon 20N inclusion. Since Scn1a expression in the brain is regulated developmentally, we next explored the developmental relationship between exon 20N inclusion and Scn1a expression. During normal embryogenesis, when Scn1a expression was low, exon 20N inclusion was high; postnatally, as Scn1a expression increased, there was a corresponding decrease in exon 20N usage. Expression of another voltage-gated sodium channel transcript, Scn8a (Nav1.6), was similarly regulated, with inclusion of a poison exon termed as 18N early in development when Scn8a expression was low, followed by a postnatal decrease in exon 18N inclusion and corresponding increase in Scn8a expression. Together, these data demonstrate that poison exon inclusion is a conserved mechanism to control sodium channel expression in the brain, and that an intronic mutation that disrupts the normal developmental regulation of poison exon inclusion leads to reduced Nav1.1 and DS pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the main bacterial model to study cooperative behaviors, since it yields exoproducts such as exoproteases and siderophores that act as public goods and can be exploited by selfish non-producers that behave as social cheaters. Non-producers of the siderophore pyoverdine are typically isolated in media with low free iron, mainly casamino acids medium supplemented with transferrin. Nevertheless, using a protein as the iron chelator could additionally select mutants unable to produce exoproteases that degrade the transferrin to facilitate iron release. Here, we investigated the dynamics of pyoverdine and exoprotease production in media in which iron was limited by using either transferrin or a cation chelating resin. Our experiments show that concomitant loss of pyoverdine and exoprotease production readily develops in media with transferrin whereas only lack of pyoverdine emerges in medium treated with the resin. Genomic characterization of the exoprotease- and pyoverdine-less mutants revealed large deletions (13 to 33 Kb) including Quorum Sensing (lasR, rsal and lasl) and flagellar genes. Complementation experiments, PCR and motility tests confirmed the deletions. Our work shows that using transferrin as an iron chelator imposes simultaneous selective pressure for the loss of pyoverdine and exoprotease production. The unintended effect of transferrin observed in our experiment settings can help revisiting or informing the design of similar studies.",

    "abstract": "Severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) survivors experience permanent functional disabilities due to significant volume loss and the brains poor capacity to regenerate. Chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans (CS-GAGs) are key regulators of growth factor signaling and neural stem cell homeostasis in the brain. However, the efficacy of engineered CS (eCS) matrices in mediating structural and functional recovery after sTBI has not been investigated. We report that neurotrophic factor functionalized acellular eCS matrices implanted into the rat M1 region acutely post-sTBI, significantly enhanced cellular repair and gross motor function recovery when compared to controls, 20 weeks post-sTBI. Animals subjected to M2 region injuries followed by eCS matrix implantations, demonstrated the significant recovery of  reach-to-grasp function. This was attributed to enhanced volumetric vascularization, activity-regulated cytoskeleton (Arc) protein expression, and perilesional sensorimotor connectivity. These findings indicate that eCS matrices implanted acutely post-sTBI can support complex cellular, vascular, and neuronal circuit repair, chronically after sTBI.",

    "abstract": "Somatic mutations in the spliceosome gene U2AF1 are common in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. U2AF1 mutations that code for the most common amino acid substitutions are always heterozygous, and the retained wild-type allele is expressed, suggesting that mutant hematopoietic cells may require the residual wild-type allele to be viable and cause disease. We show that hematopoiesis and RNA splicing in U2af1 heterozygous knock-out mice was similar to control mice, but that deletion of the wild-type allele in U2AF1(S34F) heterozygous mutant expressing hematopoietic cells (i.e., hemizygous mutant) was lethal. These results confirm that U2AF1 mutant hematopoietic cells are dependent on the expression of wild-type U2AF1 for survival in vivo and that U2AF1 is a haplo-essential cancer gene. Mutant U2AF1 (S34F) expressing cells were also more sensitive to reduced, but not absent, expression of wild-type U2AF1 than non-mutant cells. Furthermore, mice transplanted with leukemia cells expressing mutant U2AF1 had significantly reduced tumor burden and improved survival after the wild-type U2af1 allele was deleted compared to when it was not deleted. These results suggest that selectively targeting the wild-type U2AF1 allele in heterozygous mutant cells could induce cancer cell death and be a therapeutic strategy for patients harboring U2AF1 mutations.",

An examination of a collection of 10 cultivated and 6 wild Korean soybean varieties showed that there is phenotypic variability notable in different soybeans. Therefore, to develop a list of biomarker candidates useful for growing soybeans of better quality and quantity, The genes of 16 Korean soybean varieties were compared with those of the reference Glycine max var. Williams 82. The comparison was made through gene sequencing to facilitate selection of nsSNPs. The objective of the study was to find out the structural and functional variations caused by nsSNPs and discuss whether the collection of Korean soybean varieties qualifies as biomarkers based on their phenotypic traits.\n\nAnalysis of the data collected was done using four software: SIFT, Polyphen, PANTHER, and I-mutant 2.0, which are designed to detect the rate of functional and structural variations caused by the nsSNPs in cultivated and wild soybean varieties. Genotypic information obtained in the analysis was used to develop a core collection of biomarkers based on whether nsSNP content was found in more than half of the 16 samples. Therefore, the list of biomarker candidates developed from this study showed that Korean soybean could provide valuable information needed in both future crop genetic research and identification of biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "Fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system relies on the AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR). This receptor incorporates a non-selective cation channel which is opened by the binding of glutamate. Although the open pore structure has recently became available from cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM), the molecular mechanisms governing cation permeability in AMPA receptors are not understood. Here, we combined microsecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on a putative open state structure of GluA2 with electrophysiology on cloned channels to elucidate ion permeation mechanisms. Na+, K+ and Cs+ permeated at physiological rates, consistent with a structure that represents a true open state. A single major ion binding site for Na+ and K+ in the pore represents the simplest selectivity filter (SF) structure for any tetrameric cation channel of known structure. The minimal SF comprised only Q586 and Q587, and other residues on the cytoplasmic side formed a cone- shaped void that lacked major interactions with ions. We observed Cl- invasion of the upper pore, explaining anion permeation in the edited form of GluA2. A permissive architecture of the SF accommodated different alkali metals in distinct solvation states to allow rapid, non-selective cation permeation, and co-permeation by water. Simulations suggested Cs+ uses two equally populated ion binding sites in the filter and we confirmed with electrophysiology of GluA2 that Cs+ is more permeant than Na+, consistent with serial binding sites preferentially driving selectivity.\n\nSignificance StatementAMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) are key actors in neurotransmission, making the final step in a relay of excitability from one brain cell to another. The receptor contains an integral ion channel, which, when opened by neurotransmitter binding, permits sodium and other cations to cross the cell membrane. We investigated permeation of sodium, potassium and caesium in an AMPAR at the atomistic level using a computational molecular dynamics approach on a structure with the ion channel pore in a presumably open state. We determined that the region selecting between cations is the simplest of any channel of this type. Distinct from ion channels that select single ion species, cations are never fully dehydrated and have only one major ion binding site in the filter. Simulations suggested two similar binding sites for caesium, and studies of AMPARs in mammalian cell membranes showed that this makes caesium more permeant than sodium.",

    "abstract": "Biomolecular assemblies govern the physiology of cells. Their function often depends on the changes in molecular arrangements of constituents, both in the positions and orientations. While recent advancements of fluorescence microscopy including super-resolution microscopy have enabled us to determine the positions of fluorophores with unprecedented accuracy, monitoring orientation of fluorescently labeled molecules within living cells in real-time is challenging. Fluorescence polarization microscopy (FPM) reports the orientation of emission dipoles and is therefore a promising solution. For imaging with FPM, target proteins need labeling with fluorescent probes in a sterically constrained manner, but due to difficulties in the rational three-dimensional design of protein connection, universal method for constrained tagging with fluorophore was not available. Here we report POLArIS, a genetically encoded and versatile probe for molecular orientation imaging. Instead of using a direct tagging approach, we used a recombinant binder connected to a fluorescent protein in a sterically constrained manner and can target arbitrary biomolecules by combining with phage-display screening. As an initial test case of POLArIS, we developed POLArISact, which specifically binds to F-actin in living cells. We confirmed that the orientation of F-actin can be monitored by observing cells expressing POLArISact with FPM. In living starfish early embryos expressing POLArISact, we found actin filaments radially extending from centrosomes in association with microtubule asters during mitosis. By taking advantage of the genetically encoded nature, POLArIS can be used in a variety of living specimens including whole bodies of developing embryos and animals, and also expressed in a cell-type/tissue specific manner.",

Coronavirus transcription also involves template switching at specific regions, called transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS). It is hypothesized but not yet verified that TRS sites are prone to recombination events. Here, we developed a tool called SuPER to systematically identify TRS in coronavirus genomes and then investigated whether recombination is more common at TRS. We ran SuPER on 506 coronavirus genomes and identified 465 TRS-L and 3509 TRS-B. We found that the TRS-L core sequence (CS) and the secondary structure of the leader sequence are generally conserved within coronavirus genera but different between genera. By examining the location of recombination breakpoints with respect to TRS-B CS, we observed that recombination hotspots are more frequently co-located with TRS-B sites than expected.",

It is characterized by two inhibitory domains and each domain presents six cysteines that form three disulfide bonds, which contribute to the high stability of its structure. Previous studies suggest that serine protease inhibitor rBmTI-A has a protective potential against pulmonary emphysema in mice and anti-inflammatory potential, besides rBmTI-A presented a potent inhibitory activity against in vitro vessel formation. In this study, the tertiary structure of BmTI-A was modeled based on the structure of its Sabellastarte magnifica homologue. The structure stabilization was evaluated by molecular dynamics analysis. Circular dichroism data corroborated the secondary structure found by the homology modeling. Thermostability analysis confirmed the thermostability and the relation between the effects of the temperature in the inhibitor activity. The loss of activity observed was gradual, and, after 60 minutes of incubation at 90{degrees}C the inhibitor lost it completely.",

    "abstract": "Odontoblast processes are thin cytoplasmic projections that extend from the cell body at the periphery of the pulp toward the dentin-enamel junction. The odontoblast processes function in the secretion and assembly of dentin during development, participate in mechanosensation, and aid in dentin repair in mature teeth. Because they are small and densely arranged, their three-dimensional organization is not well documented. To gain further insight into how odontoblast processes contribute to odontogenesis, we used serial section electron microscopy to examine these processes in the predentin region of mouse molars and incisors. In molars, the odontoblast processes are tubular with a diameter of ~1.8 m. The odontoblast processes near the incisor tip are similarly shaped, but those midway between the tip and apex are shaped like plates. The plates are radially aligned and longitudinally oriented with respect to the growth axis of the incisor. The thickness of the plates is approximately the same as the diameter of molar odontoblast processes. The plates have an irregular edge; the average ratio of width (midway in the predentin) to thickness is 2.3 on the labial side and 3.6 on the lingual side. The plate geometry seems likely to be related to the continuous growth of the incisor and may provide a clue as to the mechanisms by which the odontoblast processes are involved in tooth development.",

    "abstract": "Microtidal estuaries in Mediterranean climates are particularly vulnerable to the effects of anthropogenic degradation. This study provides the first data on the fish and benthic macroinvertebrate fauna of Hill Inlet, the northernmost estuary in south-western Australia. Sampling was conducted in June 2019 (Austral winter), when water levels were very high due to recent heavy rainfall and the bar at the mouth of the estuary was intact. Surface salinities were oligohaline and declined along the longitudinal axis, ranging from 12 to 3. A marked halocline was present at most sites, resulting in pronounced hypoxia. High water levels precluded the use of a seine net at some sites to sample the nearshore fish fauna, however, two species were recorded (Pseudogobius olorum and Acanthopagrus butcheri), both of which complete their life-cycle within the estuary. Deeper, offshore waters, sampled using gill nets, yielded only four species (Mugil cephalus, A. butcheri, Adrichetta forsteri and Pomatomus saltatrix), due to the bar at the mouth of the estuary being closed prior to sampling thus limiting recruitment from marine species. Ten benthic macroinvertebrates species were collected, representing mainly polychaetes, molluscs and crustaceans. The low number of species was likely caused by the hypoxia present throughout most of the bottom waters. Although these data represent a benchmark against which future changes can be detected, it is recommended that additional sampling is conducted when water levels are lower and the bar has been open to provide a more holistic assessment of the fauna of Hill Inlet.",

At acidic, lysosomal pH, ADA2 acts as a novel DNase that degrades cGAS/Sting-activating ligands. Furthermore, we define a clear structure-function relationship for this acidic DNase activity. Deletion of ADA2 increased the production of cGAMP and type I interferons upon exposure to dsDNA, which was reverted by ADA2 overexpression or deletion of STING.

    "abstract": "In response to nutrients, the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase regulates cell growth by setting the balance between anabolic and catabolic processes. To be active, mTORC1 requires the environmental presence of amino acids and glucose, which provide the building blocks for the biosynthesis of most macromolecules. While a mechanistic understanding of amino acid sensing by mTORC1 is emerging, how glucose activates mTORC1 remains mysterious. Here, we used metabolically engineered human cells to identify glucose-derived metabolites required to activate mTORC1. We find that mTORC1 senses a metabolite downstream of the aldolase and upstream of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase steps of glycolysis and pinpoint dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) as the key molecule. In cells expressing a triose kinase, the synthesis of DHAP from dihydroxyacetone is sufficient to activate mTORC1 even in the absence of glucose. Genetic perturbations in the GATOR-Rag signaling axis abrogate glucose sensing by mTORC1. DHAP is the glycolytic metabolite along with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) that has the greatest fold-change between cells in high and low glucose. DHAP is a precursor for lipid synthesis, a process under the control of mTORC1, which provides a potential rationale for the sensing of DHAP by mTORC1.",

    "abstract": "Whether hard sweeps or soft sweeps dominate adaptation has been a matter of much debate. Recently, we developed haplotype homozygosity statistics that (i) can detect both hard and soft sweeps with similar power and (ii) can classify the detected sweeps as hard or soft. The application of our method to population genomic data from a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster (DGRP) allowed us to rediscover three known cases of adaptation at the loci Ace, Cyp6g1, and CHKov1 known to be driven by soft sweeps, and detected additional candidate loci for recent and strong sweeps. Surprisingly, all of the top 50 candidates showed patterns much more consistent with soft rather than hard sweeps. Recently, Harris et al. 2018 criticized this work, suggesting that all the candidate loci detected by our haplotype statistics, including the positive controls, are unlikely to be sweeps at all and instead these haplotype patterns can be more easily explained by complex neutral demographic models. They also claim, confusingly, that these neutral non-sweeps are likely to be hard instead of soft sweeps. Here, we reanalyze the DGRP data using a range of complex admixture demographic models and reconfirm our original published results suggesting that the majority of recent and strong sweeps in D. melanogaster are first likely to be true sweeps, and second, that they do appear to be soft. Furthermore, we discuss ways to take this work forward given that the demographic models employed in such analyses are generally necessarily too simple to capture the full demographic complexity, while more realistic models are unlikely to be inferred correctly because they require fitting a very large number of free parameters.",

    "abstract": "Heme oxygenase-2 (HO2) and -1 (HO1) catalyze heme degradation to biliverdin, CO, and iron, forming an essential link in the heme metabolism network. Tight regulation of the cellular levels and catalytic activities of HO1 and HO2 is important for maintaining heme homeostasis. While transcriptional control of HO1 expression has been well-studied, how the cellular levels and activity of HO2 are regulated remains unclear. Here, the mechanism of post-translational regulation of cellular HO2 level by heme is elucidated. Under heme deficient conditions, HO2 is destabilized and targeted for degradation. In HO2, three heme binding sites are potential targets of heme-dependent regulation: one at its catalytic site; the others at its two heme regulatory motifs (HRMs). We report that, in contrast to other HRM-containing proteins, the cellular protein level and degradation rate of HO2 are independent of heme binding to the HRMs. Rather, under heme deficiency, loss of heme binding to the catalytic site destabilizes HO2. Consistently, a HO2 catalytic site variant that is unable to bind heme exhibits a constant low protein level and an enhanced protein degradation rate compared to the wild-type HO2. However, cellular heme overload does not affect HO2 stability. Finally, HO2 is degraded by the lysosome through chaperone-mediated autophagy, distinct from other HRM-containing proteins and HO1, which are degraded by the proteasome. These results reveal a novel aspect of HO2 regulation and deepen our understanding of HO2s role in maintaining heme homeostasis, paving the way for future investigation into HO2s pathophysiological role in heme deficiency response.",

    "abstract": "Acquired genetic mutations can confer resistance to arsenic trioxide (ATO) in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). However, such resistance-conferring mutations are rare and do not explain the majority of disease recurrence seen in the clinic. We have generated a stable ATO resistant promyelocytic cell from a ATO sensitive NB4 cell line. We also noted that another ATRA resistant cell line (UF1) was cross resistant to ATO. We have characterized these resistant cell lines and observed that they significantly differed in their immunophenotype, drug transporter expression, drug resistance mutation profile and were also cross-resistant to other conventional chemotherapeutic agents. The NB4 derived resistant cell line had the classical A216V PML-B2 domain mutation while the UF1 cell line did not. Gene expression profiling revealed prominent dysregulation of the cellular metabolic pathways in the resistant cell lines. Glycolytic inhibition by 2-DG was efficient and comparable to the standard of care (ATO) in targeting the sensitive APL cell lines and was also effective in the in vivo transplantable APL mouse model; however, it did not affect the ATO resistant cell lines. The survival of the resistant cell lines was significantly affected by compounds targeting the mitochondrial respiration irrespective of the existence of ATO resistance-conferring genetic mutations. Our data demonstrate the addition of mitocans can overcome ATO resistance. We further demonstrated that the combination of ATO and mitocans has the potential in the treatment of non-M3 AML and the translation of this approach in the clinic needs to be explored further.\n\nKey pointsO_LIMetabolic rewiring promotes ATO resistance, which can be overcome by targeting mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.\nC_LIO_LICombination of ATO and mitocans can be exploited as a potential therapeutic option for relapsed APL and in non-M3 AML patients.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The discovery that somatic cells can be reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) - cells that can be differentiated into any cell type of the three germ layers - has provided a foundation for in vitro human disease modelling1,2, drug development1,2, and population genetics studies3,4. In the majority of instances, the expression levels of genes, plays a critical role in contributing to disease risk, or the ability to identify therapeutic targets. However, while the effect of the genetic background of cell lines has been shown to strongly influence gene expression, the effect has not been evaluated at the level of individual cells. Differences in the effect of genetic variation on the gene expression of different cell-types, would provide significant resolution for in vitro research using preprogramed cells. By bringing together single cell RNA sequencing15-21 and population genetics, we now have a framework in which to evaluate the cell-types specific effects of genetic variation on gene expression. Here, we performed single cell RNA-sequencing on 64,018 fibroblasts from 79 donors and we mapped expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) at the level of individual cell types. We demonstrate that the large majority of eQTL detected in fibroblasts are specific to an individual sub-type of cells. To address if the allelic effects on gene expression are dynamic across cell reprogramming, we generated scRNA-seq data in 19,967 iPSCs from 31 reprogramed donor lines. We again identify highly cell type specific eQTL in iPSCs, and show that that the eQTL in fibroblasts are almost entirely disappear during reprogramming. This work provides an atlas of how genetic variation influences gene expression across cell subtypes, and provided evidence for patterns of genetic architecture that lead to cell-types specific eQTL effects.",

    "abstract": "5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine, also known as decitabine, is a DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) used to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Decitabine activates the transcription of endogenous retroviruses (ERV), which can induce an immune response by acting as cellular double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs). Here, we employ an image-based screening platform to identify dsRNA-binding factors that mediate the downstream effect of ERV induction. We find that Staufen1 (Stau1) knockdown decreases the interferon signature and rescues decitabine-mediated cell death. Moreover, Stau1 directly binds to ERV RNAs and stabilizes them, together with a long non-coding RNA TINCR. We further show that TINCR enhances the interaction between Stau1 and ERV RNAs. Analysis of a clinical patient cohort reveals that AML patients with low Stau1 and TINCR expressions exhibits inferior treatment outcomes to the DNMTi therapy.

    "abstract": "Sleep loss has emerged as a risk factor for the development of impaired glucose tolerance. The mechanisms underpinning this observation are unknown; however, both mitochondrial dysfunction and circadian misalignment have been proposed. Given that exercise improves glucose tolerance, mitochondrial function, and alters circadian rhythms, we investigated whether exercise may counteract the effects induced by inadequate sleep. We report that sleeping 4 hours per night, for five nights, reduced glucose tolerance, with novel observations of associated reductions in mitochondrial function, sarcoplasmic protein synthesis, and measures of circadian rhythmicity; however, incorporating three sessions of high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) during this period mitigates these effects. These data demonstrate, for the first time, a sleep loss-induced concomitant reduction in a range of physiological processes linked to metabolic function. These same effects are not observed when exercise is performed during a period of inadequate sleep, supporting the use of HIIE as an intervention to mitigate the detrimental physiological effects of sleep loss.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Viral infection is a significant burden to healthcare worldwide. Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, are widely used as cholesterol-lowering drugs. Recently, long term statin therapy was shown to reduce the antiviral immune response; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. Here, we found that simvastatin decreased polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)]-induced expression of antiviral interferon (IFN)-{beta} and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lungs of mice with high-fat diet-induced hyperlipidemia. As macrophages were the dominant cell type in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of poly(I:C)-treated mice, we examined the molecular mechanisms of statin-mediated inhibition of antiviral gene expression using murine J774.1/JA-4 macrophages. Simvastatin and pitavastatin decreased poly(I:C)-induced expression of IFN-{beta} and ISGs. Moreover, they repressed poly(I:C)-induced phosphorylation of IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 3 and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 1, which is involved in Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT signaling. Mevalonate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP), but not cholesterol, counteracted the negative effect of statins on IFN-{beta} and ISG expression and phosphorylation of IRF3 and STAT1. These results suggest that statins suppressed the expression of IFN-{beta} and ISGs in poly(I:C)-treated hyperlipidemic mice and murine macrophages, and that these effects occured through the inhibition of IRF3-mediated JAK/STAT signaling in macrophages. Furthermore, GGPP recovered the statin-suppressed IRF3/JAK/STAT signaling pathway in poly(I:C)-treated macrophages.",

    "abstract": "In plant cytokinesis, de novo formation of a cell plate evolving into the new cell wall partitions the cytoplasm of the dividing cell. Cell plate formation involves highly orchestrated vesicle accumulation, fusion, and membrane network maturation supported by the temporary integration of elastic and pliable callose. The small molecule, Endosidin 7 (ES7) arrests late cytokinesis in Arabidopsis by inhibiting callose deposition at the cell plate. Its effect is specific, as it does not broadly affect endomembrane trafficking or cytoskeletal organization. It has emerged as a very valuable tool for dissecting this essential plant process. In order to gain deeper insights regarding its mode of action and the effects of cytokinesis inhibition on overall plant growth, we investigated the effect of ES7 through a nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy metabolomics approach. In this case study, profiles of Arabidopsis leaf and root tissues were analyzed at different growth stages and ES7 exposure levels. The results show tissue-specific changes in the plant metabolic profile across a developmental gradient, and the effect that ES7 treatment has on the corresponding metabolome. The ES7 induced profile suggests metabolic compensations in central metabolism pathways in response to cytokinesis inhibition. Further, this study shows that long-term treatment of ES7 disrupts the homeostasis of primary metabolism in Arabidopsis seedlings, likely via alteration of hormonal regulation.",

    "abstract": "Many signal transduction systems have an apparent redundancy built into them, where multiple physiological agonists activate the same receptors. Whether this is true redundancy, or whether this provides as-yet unrecognized specificity in downstream signaling, is not well understood. We address this question using the kappa opioid receptor (KOR), a physiologically relevant G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is activated by multiple members of the Dynorphin family of opioid peptides. We show that, although highly related Dynorphins bind and activate KOR to similar extents on the cell surface, they localize KOR to distinct subcellular compartments, dictate different post-endocytic fates of the receptor, and differentially induce KOR signaling from the degradative pathway. Our results show that seemingly redundant endogenous opioid peptides that are often co-released can in fact fine-tune signaling by differentially regulating the subcellular spatial profile of GPCR localization and signaling.",
