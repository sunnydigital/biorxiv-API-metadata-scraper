    "abstract": "Recently, the Syrian golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) has been demonstrated as a clinically relevant animal model for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, lack of knowledge about the tissue-specific expression pattern of various proteins in these animals and the unavailability of reagents like antibodies against this species hampers optimal use of these models. The major objective of our current study was to analyze the tissue-specific expression pattern of angiotensin{square}converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a proven functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in different organs of the hamster. We have adapted immunoblot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence analysis techniques to evaluate the ACE2 expression pattern in different tissues of the Syrian golden hamster. We found that kidney, small intestine, esophagus, tongue, brain, and liver express ACE2. Epithelium of proximal tubules of kidney and surface epithelium of ileum expresses a very high amount of this protein. Surprisingly, analysis of stained tissue sections for ACE2 showed no detectable expression of ACE2 in the lung or tracheal epithelial cells. Similarly, all parts of the large intestine (caecum, colon, and rectum) were negative for ACE2 expression. Together, our findings corroborate some of the earlier reports related to ACE2 expression pattern in human tissues and also contradicts some others. We believe that the findings of this study will enable the appropriate use of the Syrian golden hamster to carryout SARS-CoV-2 related studies.",

    "abstract": "The nucleocapsid (N) protein of coronaviruses serves two major functions: compaction of the RNA genome in the virion and regulation of viral gene transcription in the infected cell1\u20133. The N protein contains two globular RNA-binding domains surrounded by regions of intrinsic disorder4. Phosphorylation of the central disordered region is required for normal viral genome transcription5,6, which occurs in a cytoplasmic structure called the replication transcription complex (RTC)7\u201311. It is not known how phosphorylation controls N protein function. Here we show that the N protein of SARS-CoV-2, together with viral RNA, forms biomolecular condensates12\u201315. Unmodified N protein forms partially ordered gel-like structures that depend on multivalent RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions. Phosphorylation reduces a subset of these interactions, generating a more liquid-like droplet. We speculate that distinct oligomeric states support the two functions of the N protein: unmodified protein forms a structured oligomer that is suited for nucleocapsid assembly, and phosphorylated protein forms a liquid-like compartment for viral genome processing. Inhibitors of N protein phosphorylation could therefore serve as antiviral therapy.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the latest respiratory pandemic resulting from zoonotic transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Severe symptoms include viral pneumonia secondary to infection and inflammation of the lower respiratory tract, in some cases causing death. We developed primary human lung epithelial infection models to understand responses of proximal and distal lung epithelium to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Differentiated air-liquid interface cultures of proximal airway epithelium and 3D organoid cultures of alveolar epithelium were readily infected by SARS-CoV-2 leading to an epithelial cell-autonomous proinflammatory response. We validated the efficacy of selected candidate COVID-19 drugs confirming that Remdesivir strongly suppressed viral infection/replication. We provide a relevant platform for studying COVID-19 pathobiology and for rapid drug screening against SARS-CoV-2 and future emergent respiratory pathogens.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA novel infection model of the adult human lung epithelium serves as a platform for COVID-19 studies and drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Since the emergence of CoVID-19 pandemic in China in late 2019, scientists are striving hard to explore non-toxic, viable anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds or medicines. We determined In Vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of oral formulations (syrup and capsule) of an Iodine-complex (Renessans). A monolayer of vero cells were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in the presence and absence of different concentrations (equivalent to 50, 05 and 0.5 g/ml of I2) of Renessans. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of each of the formulation was assessed in the form of cell survival, SARS-CoV-2-specific cytopathic effect (CPE) and genome quantization. With varying concentrations of syrup and capsule, a varying rate of inhibition of CPE, cells survival and virus replication was observed. Compared to 0.5 g/ml concentration of Renessans syrup, 5 and 50 g/ml showed comparable results where there was a 100% cell survival, no CPEs and a negligible viral replication ({Delta}CT= 0.11 and 0.13, respectively). This study indicates that Renessans, containing iodine, may have potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 which needs to be further investigated in human clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "The renal lesions \u2013 including severe acute kidney injury \u2013 are severe outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infections. There are no reports regarding the influence of the nutritional status on the severity and progress of these lesions. Ageing is also an important risk factor. In the present communication we compare the influence of overweight and undernutrition in the levels of renal angiotensin converting enzymes 1 and 2. Since the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has been implicated in the progress of kidney failure during Covid-19, we also investigated the influence of Angiotensin-(3\u20134) (Ang-(3\u20134)) the shortest angiotensin-derived peptide, which is considered the physiological antagonist of several angiotensin II effects. We found that both overweight and undernutrition downregulate the levels of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) without influence on the levels of ACE1 in kidney rats. Administration of Ang-(3\u20134) recovers the control levels of ACE2 in overweight but not in undernourished rats. We conclude that chronic and opposite nutritional conditions play a central role in the pathophysiology of renal Covid-19 lesions, and that the role of RAAS is also different in overweight and undernutrition.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "In order to explore nonsynonymous mutations and deletions in the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, we comprehensively analyzed 35,750 complete S protein gene sequences from across six continents and five climate zones around the world, as documented in the GISAID database as of June 24th, 2020. Through a custom Python-based pipeline for analyzing mutations, we identified 27,801 (77.77 % of spike sequences) mutated strains compared to Wuhan-Hu-1 strain. 84.40% of these strains had only single amino-acid (aa) substitution mutations, but an outlier strain from Bosnia and Herzegovina (EPI_ISL_463893) was found to possess six aa substitutions. The D614G variant of the major G clade was found to be predominant across circulating strains in all climates. We also identified 988 unique aa substitution mutations distributed across 660 positions within the spike protein, with eleven sites showing high variability - these sites had four types of aa variations at each position. Besides, 17 in-frame deletions at four major regions (three in N-terminal domain and one just downstream of the RBD) may have possible impact on attenuation. Moreover, the mutational frequency differed significantly (p= 0.003, Kruskal-Wallis test) among the SARS-CoV-2 strains worldwide. This study presents a fast and accurate pipeline for identifying nonsynonymous mutations and deletions from large dataset for any particular protein coding sequence and presents this S protein data as representative analysis. By using separate multi-sequence alignment with MAFFT, removing ambiguous sequences and in-frame stop codons, and utilizing pairwise alignment, this method can derive nonsynonymus mutations (Reference:Position:Strain). We believe this will aid in the surveillance of any proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2, and will prove to be crucial in tracking the ever-increasing variation of many other divergent RNA viruses in the future.",

    "abstract": "Previous data suggests that anti-OX40 mAb can elicit anti-tumour effects in mice through deletion of Tregs. However, OX40 also has powerful costimulatory effects on T cells which could evoke therapeutic responses. The contributions of these different effector mechanisms has not previously been systematically evaluated, particularly for mAb directed to human OX40. Therefore, we generated a novel human OX40 knock-in (KI) mouse to evaluate a panel of anti-hOX40 mAb and show that their activities relate directly to two key properties: 1) isotype \u2013 with mIgG1 mAb evoking receptor agonism and CD8+ T cell expansion and mIgG2a mAb evoking deletion of Treg and; 2) epitope - with membrane-proximal mAb delivering more powerful agonism. Intriguingly, both isotypes acted therapeutically in tumour models by engaging these different mechanisms. These findings highlight the significant impact of isotype and epitope on the modulation of anti-hOX40 mAb therapy, and indicate that CD8+ T cell expansion or Treg depletion might be preferable according to the composition of different tumours.Summary Human trials with anti-OX40 antibodies have been disappointing indicating that optimal reagents have not yet been developed. Here, using a new panel of antibodies, we show that isotype and epitope combine to determine agonistic and therapeutic activity.Competing Interest StatementMSC is a retained consultant for BioInvent International and has performed educational and advisory roles for Baxalta and Boehringer Ingleheim.

    "abstract": "Chagas disease (CD) is one of thirteen neglected tropical diseases caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. CD is a vector-borne disease transmitted by triatomines but CD can also be transmitted through blood transfusions, organ transplants and congenital transmission. While endemic to Latin America, T. cruzi infects 7-8 million people worldwide and can induce severe cardiac symptoms including apical aneurysms, thromboembolisms and arrhythmias during the chronic stage of CD. However, these cardiac clinical manifestations and CD disease pathogenesis are not fully understood. Using spatial metabolomics (chemical cartography), we sought to understand the localized impact of infection on the cardiac metabolome of mice chronically infected with two divergent T. cruzi strains. Our data showed chemical differences in localized cardiac regions upon chronic T. cruzi infection, indicating that parasite infection changes the host metabolome at select sites in chronic CD. These sites were distinct from the sites of highest parasite burden. In addition, we identified acylcarnitines and phosphocholines as discriminatory chemical families within each heart region, comparing infected and uninfected samples. Overall, our study indicated overall and positional metabolic differences common to infection with different T. cruzi strains, and identified select infection-modulated pathways. These results provide further insight into CD pathogenesis and demonstrate the advantage of a spatial perspective to understand infectious disease tropism.Author Summary Chagas disease (CD) is a tropical disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. CD originated in South America; however, there are now 7-8 million people infected worldwide due to population movements. CD is transmitted through a triatomine vector, organ transplants, blood transfusions and congenital transmission. It occurs in two stages, an acute stage (usually asymptomatic) and the chronic stage. Chronic stage CD presents with severe cardiac symptoms such as heart failure, localized aneurysms and cardiomyopathy. Unfortunately, what causes severe cardiac symptoms in some individuals in chronic CD is not fully understood. Therefore, we used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the heart tissue of chronically T. cruzi-infected and uninfected mice, to understand the impact of infection on the tissue metabolome. We identified discriminatory small molecules related to T. cruzi infection. We also determined that regions with the highest parasite burden are distinct from the regions with the largest changes in overall metabolite profile; these locations of high metabolic perturbation provide a molecular mechanism to why localized cardiac symptoms occur in CD. Overall, our work gives insight to chronic cardiac CD symptom development and shapes a framework for novel treatment and biomarker development.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Endothelial cells play a key role in the regulation of disease and other developmental processes. Defective regulation of endothelial cell homeostasis may cause mesenchymal activation of other endothelial cells by autocrine effects or of neighboring cell types by paracrine effects, and in both cases contribute to organ fibrosis. However, regulatory control of endothelial cell homeostasis, is not well studied. Diabetes induced renal fibrosis in endothelial GR knock out mice (GRfl/fl;Tie 1 Cre; GRECKO) but not in control mice (GRfl/fl); hypercholesterolemia further enhanced severe renal fibrosis in diabetic GRECKO; Apoe-/- (DKO) but not in diabetic littermates (GRfl/fl; Apoe-/-). The fibrogenic phenotype in the kidneys of diabetic GRECKO and diabetic DKO were associated with aberrant cytokine and chemokine reprogramming. Canonical Wnt signaling was identified as new target for the action of endothelial GR. Wnt inhibiton improved kidney fibrosis by mitigating endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (EMT). Similarly, activation of fatty acid oxidation also suppressed kidney fibrosis. Conditioned media from endothelial cells from diabetic GRECKO stimulated Wnt signaling-dependent epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in tubular epithelial cells from diabetic controls. These data demonstrate that endothelial GR is an essential antifibrotic core molecule in diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Integral membrane proteins of the Lap2-emerin-MAN1 (LEM) family have emerged as important components of the inner nuclear membrane (INM) required for the functional and physical integrity of the nuclear envelope. However, like many INM proteins, there is limited understanding of the biochemical interaction networks that enable LEM protein function. Here, we show that Heh2/Man1 can be affinity purified with major scaffold components of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), specifically the inner ring complex, in evolutionarily distant yeasts. Interactions between Heh2 and nucleoporins is mediated by its C-terminal winged-helix (WH) domain and are distinct from interactions required for INM targeting. Disrupting interactions between Heh2 and the NPC leads to NPC clustering. Interestingly, Heh2s association with NPCs can also be broken by knocking out Nup133, a component of the outer ring that does not physically interact with Heh2. Thus, Heh2s association with NPCs depends on the structural integrity of both major NPC scaffold complexes. We propose a model in which Heh2 acts as a sensor of NPC assembly state, which may be important for NPC quality control mechanisms and the segregation of NPCs during cell division.",

    "abstract": "The chromosome of Escherichia Coli (E. coli) is riddled with multi-faceted complexity and its nature of organization is slowly getting recognised. The emergence of chromosome conformation capture techniques and super-resolution microscopy are providing newer ways to explore chromosome organization, and dynamics and its effect on gene expression. Here we combine a beads-on-a-spring polymer-based framework with recently reported high-resolution Hi-C data of E. coli chromosome to develop a comprehensive model of E. coli chromosome at 5 kilo base-pair resolution. The model captures a self-organised chromosome composed of linearly organised genetic loci, and segregated macrodomains within a ring-like helicoid architecture, with no net chirality. Additionally, a genome-wide map identifies multiple chromosomal interaction domains (CIDs) and corroborates well with a transcription-centric model of the E. coli chromosome. The investigation further demonstrates that while only a small fraction of the Hi-C contacts is dictating the underlying chromosomal organization, a random-walk polymer chain devoid of Hi-C encoded contact information would fail to map the key genomic interactions unique to E. coli. Collectively, the present work, integrated with Hi-C interaction, elucidates the organization of bacterial chromosome at multiple scales, ranging from identifying a helical, macro-domain-segregated morphology at coarse-grained scale to a manifestation of CIDs at a fine-grained scale.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTWhile the notion that G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) associate into homo- and hetero-oligomers has gained more recognition in recent years, a lack of consensus remains among researchers regarding the functional relevance of GPCR oligomerization. A relatively recent technique, F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) spectrometry, allows for the determination of the oligomeric (or quaternary) structure of proteins in living cells via analysis of efficiency distributions of energy transferred from optically excited fluorescent tags acting as donors of energy to fluorescent tags acting as acceptors of energy and residing within the same oligomer. In this study, we significantly improved the resolution of the FRET-spectrometry approach to detect small differences between the interprotomeric distances among GPCR oligomers with subtle differences in quaternary structures. We then used this approach to study the conformational substates of oligomers of sterile 2 \u03b1-factor receptor (Ste2), a class D GPCR found in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae of mating type a. Ste2 has previously been shown to form tetrameric oligomers at relatively low expression levels (between 11 and 140 molecules/\u03bcm2) in the absence of its cognate ligand, the \u03b1-factor pheromone. The significantly improved FRET spectrometry technique allowed us to detect multiple distinct quaternary conformational substates of Ste2 oligomers, and to assess how the \u03b1-factor ligand altered the proportion of such substates. The ability to determine quaternary structure substates of GPCRs provides exquisite means to elucidate functional relevance of GPCR oligomerization.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

Here we mined the genomes of more than 60 Dipteran species and reconstructed the evolution of their opsin genes in a phylogenetic framework. Our phylogenies indicate that dipterans possess an ancestral set of five core opsins which have undergone several lineage-specific events including an independent expansion of low wavelength opsins in flies and mosquitoes and numerous family specific duplications and losses. Molecular evolutionary studies indicate that gene turnover rate, overall mutation rate, and site-specific selective pressure are higher in Anopheles than in Drosophila; we found signs of positive selection in both lineages, including events possibly associated with their peculiar behaviour. Our findings indicate an extremely variable pattern of opsin evolution in dipterans, showcasing how two similarly aged radiations - Anopheles and Drosophila - can be characterized by contrasting dynamics in the evolution of this gene family.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal disorder characterised by progressive, destructive lung scarring. Despite significant progress, the genetic determinants of this disease remain incompletely defined. Using next generation sequencing data from 752 individuals with sporadic IPF and 119,055 controls, we performed both variant- and gene-level analyses to identify novel IPF genetic risk factors. Our variant-level analysis revealed a novel rare missense variant in SPDL1 (NM_017785.5 p.Arg20Gln; p = 2.4 x 10-7, odds ratio = 2.87). This signal was independently replicated in the FinnGen cohort (combined p = 2.2 x 10-20), firmly associating this variant as a novel IPF risk allele. SPDL1 encodes Spindly, a protein involved in mitotic checkpoint signalling during cell division that has not been previously described in fibrosis. Our results highlight a novel mechanism underlying IPF, providing the potential for new therapeutic discoveries in a disease of great unmet need.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSince December 2019, the world is experiencing an unprecedented crisis due to a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Owing to poor understanding of pathogenicity, the virus is eluding treatment and complicating recovery. Regulatory roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) during viral infection and associated antagonism of host antiviral immune responses has become more evident in last decade. To elucidate possible functions of lncRNAs in the COVID-19 pathobiology, we have utilized RNA-seq dataset of SARS-CoV-2 infected lung epithelial cells.\n\nResultsOur analyses uncover 21 differentially expressed lncRNAs whose functions are broadly involved in cell survival and regulation of gene expression. By network enrichment analysis we find that these lncRNAs can directly interact with differentially expressed protein-coding genes ADAR, EDN1, KYNU, MALL, TLR2 and YWHAG; and also AKAP8L, EXOSC5, GDF15, HECTD1, LARP4B, LARP7, MIPOL1, UPF1, MOV10 and PRKAR2A, host genes that interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. These genes are involved in cellular signaling, metabolism, immune response and RNA homeostasis. Since lncRNAs have been known to sponge microRNAs and protect expression of upregulated genes, we also identified 9 microRNAs that are induced in viral infections; however, some lncRNAs are able to block their usual suppressive effect on overexpressed genes and consequently contribute to host defense and cell survival.\n\nConclusionsOur investigation determines that deregulated lncRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 infection are involved in viral proliferation, cellular survival, and immune response, ultimately determining disease outcome and this information could drive the search for novel RNA therapeutics as a treatment option.",

    "abstract": "The mutual dependence of human and animal health is central to the One Health initiative as an integrated strategy for infectious disease control and management. A crucial element of the One Health includes preparation and response to influenza A virus (IAV) threats at the human-animal interface. The IAVs are characterized by extensive genetic variability, they circulate among different hosts and establish host-specific lineages. The four main host reservoirs are: avian, swine, human and equine, with occasional transmission to other mammalian species. The host diversity is mirrored in the range of the RT-qPCR assays for IAV detection. Different assays are recommended by the responsible health authorities for generic IAV detection in birds, swine or humans. In order to unify IAV monitoring in different hosts and apply the One Health approach, we developed a single RT-qPCR assay for universal detection of all IAVs of all subtypes, species origin and global distribution. The assay design was centred on a highly conserved region of the IAV MP-segment identified by a comprehensive analysis of 99,353 sequences. The reaction parameters were effectively optimised with efficiency of 93-97% and LOD95% of approximately ten IAV templates per reaction. The assay showed high repeatability, reproducibility and robustness. The extensive in silico evaluation demonstrated high inclusivity, i.e. perfect sequence match in the primers and probe binding regions, established as 94.6% for swine, 98.2% for avian and 100% for human H3N2, pandemic H1N1, as well as other IAV strains, resulting in an overall predicted detection rate of 99% on the analysed dataset. The theoretical predictions were confirmed and extensively validated by collaboration between six veterinary or human diagnostic laboratories on a total of 1970 specimens, of which 1455 were clinical and included a diverse panel of IAV strains.",

Human Pol III misregulation is linked to tumour transformation, neurodegenerative and developmental disorders, and increased sensitivity to viral infections. Pol III inhibition increases longevity in different animals but also promotes intracellular bacterial growth owing to its role in the immune system. This highlights the importance to better understand human Pol III transcription on a molecular level. Here, we present cryo-EM structures at 2.8 to 3.3 \u00c5 resolution of transcribing and unbound human Pol III purified from human suspension cells that were gene-edited by CRISPR-Cas9. We observe insertion of the TFIIS-like subunit RPC10 into the polymerase funnel, providing insights into how RPC10 triggers transcription termination. Our structures also resolve elements absent from S. cerevisiae Pol III such as the winged-helix domains of RPC5 and an iron-sulphur cluster in RPC6, which tethers the heterotrimer subcomplex to the Pol III core. The cancer-associated RPC7\u03b1 isoform binds the polymerase clamp, potentially interfering with Pol III inhibition by the tumour suppressor MAF1, which may explain why overexpressed RPC7\u03b1 enhances tumour transformation. Finally, the human Pol III structure allows mapping of disease-related mutations and might contribute to developing inhibitors that selectively target Pol III for therapeutic interventions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Recent work indicates a role for RING finger protein 11 (RNF11) in Parkinson disease (PD) pathology, which involves the loss of dopaminergic neurons. However, the role of RNF11 in regulating dopamine neurotransmission has not been studied. In this work, we tested the effect of RNF11 RNAi knockdown or overexpression on stimulated dopamine release in the larval Drosophila central nervous system. Dopamine release was stimulated using optogenetics and monitored in real-time using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry at an electrode implanted in an isolated ventral nerve cord. RNF11 knockdown doubled dopamine release, but there was no decrease in dopamine from RNF11 overexpression. RNF11 knockdown did not significantly increase stimulated serotonin or octopamine release, indicating the effect is dopamine specific. Dopamine clearance was also changed, as RNF11 RNAi flies had a higher Vmax and RNF11 overexpressing flies had a lower Vmax than control flies. RNF11 RNAi flies had increased mRNA levels of dopamine transporter (DAT) in RNF11, confirming changes in DAT. In RNF11 RNAi flies, release was maintained better for stimulations repeated at short intervals, indicating increases in the recycled releasable pool of dopamine. Nisoxetine, a DAT inhibitor, and flupenthixol, a D2 antagonist, did not affect RNF11 RNAi or overexpressing flies differently than control. Thus, RNF11 knockdown causes early changes in dopamine neurotransmission, and this is the first work to demonstrate that RNF11 affects both dopamine release and uptake. RNF11 expression decreases in human dopaminergic neurons during PD, and that decrease may be protective by increasing dopamine neurotransmission in the surviving dopaminergic neurons.",

However, the etiological factors, prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers are not well known. Neurokinin-1 Receptor (NK-1R) is a receptor of tachykinin peptide, Substance P (SP) and has a role in various pathological conditions, cancers but its association with miscarriages and significance as a clinicopathological parameter is not studied. Accordingly, the present study aimed to clarify the localization and expression for NK-1R in human retained products of conception. Role of NK-1R is not known in miscarriages.\n\nMaterials and MethodsNK-1R expression was assessed in products of conception by immunohistochemistry. Protein expression was evaluated using the nuclear labelling index (%).\n\nResultsTen human products of conception tissues were studied by immunohistochemistry to demonstrate the localization of NK-1R. The expression of NK-1R protein was high in all the cases of POCs. NK-1R expression showed no notable differences among different cases of miscarriages irrespective of the mothers age and gestational age at which the event occurred.\n\nConclusionsExpression of NK-1R was similar in all the cases and it was intense. It shows that dysregulation of NK-1R along with its ligand Substance P might be involved in miscarriages. Our results provide fundamental data regarding this anti-NK-1R strategy. Thus, the present study recommends that SP/NK1R system might, therefore, be considered as an emerging and promising diagnostic and therapeutic strategy against miscarriages. Hence, we report for the first time, the expression and localization of NK-1R in products of conception. We suggest NK-1R antagonist in addition to the Immunoglobulins and Human chorionic gonadotropin, to diagnose and treat spontaneous miscarriages.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTForward genetics is a powerful tool to establish phenotype-genotype correlations in virtually all areas of plant biology and has been particularly successful in the model plant Arabidopsis. This approach typically starts with a phenotype in an M2 mutant, followed by identifying a causal DNA change in F2 populations resulting from a cross between the mutant and a wildtype individual. Ultimately, two additional generations are needed to pinpoint causal DNA changes upon mutant identification. We postulated that genome-wide allele frequency distributions within the mutants of M2 families facilitate discrimination of causal versus non-causal mutations, essentially eliminating the need for F2 populations. In a proof-of-principle experiment, we aimed to identify signalling components employed by the executor-type resistance (R) protein, Bs4C, from pepper (Capsicum pubescens). In a native setting, Bs4C is transcriptionally activated by and mediates recognition of the transcription activator-like effector AvrBs4 from the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas. Arabidopsis containing an estradiol-inducible Bs4C transgene was used in a conditionally lethal screen to identify second-site suppressor mutations. Whole genome sequencing was used for M2 mutant allele-frequency distribution (MAD) mapping in three independent M2 families. MAD-mapping uncovered that all three families harboured mutations in XRN4, a novel component of executor R protein pathways. Our work demonstrates that causal mutations observed in forward genetic screens can be identified immediately in M2 families instead of derived F2 families. Notably, the timesaving concept of MAD mapping should be applicable to most crop species and will advance the appeal of forward genetics beyond applications in fundamental research.SIGNIFICANCE Forward genetics has uncovered numerous genes that govern plant immune reactions. This procedure relies on mutant plants with modified immune reactions followed by identification of causal DNA changes in derived F2 progeny. We developed a novel forward genetics concept where causal DNA changes are identified in the initial M2 mutants, making time consuming establishment of F2 populations obsolete. To confirm the feasibility of the concept, we mutagenized transgenic Arabidopsis seeds containing the cell death executing resistance gene Bs4C from pepper. Whole-genome sequencing of identified mutant families that lack a Bs4C-dependent cell death revealed the XRN4 gene as a novel component of Bs4C-dependent cell death. This confirms our hypothesis that causal mutations can be identified directly within phenotypically selected mutant families.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "While most individuals with access to alcohol drink it recreationally, about 5 % lose control over their intake and progressively develop an alcohol use disorder (AUD), characterised by compulsive alcohol drinking accompanied by decreased interest in alternative sources of reinforcement. The neural and molecular mechanisms underlying the vulnerability to switch from controlled to compulsive alcohol intake have not been fully characterized, so limiting the development of new treatments for AUD. It has recently been shown that rats having reduced levels of expression of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter, GAT-3, in the amygdala tend to persist in seeking and drinking alcohol even when adulterated with quinine, suggesting that pharmacological interventions aimed at restoring GABA homeostasis in these individuals may provide a targeted treatment to limit compulsive alcohol drinking. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen, which decreases GABA release, specifically decreases compulsive alcohol drinking in vulnerable individuals. In a large cohort of Sprague-Dawley rats allowed to drink alcohol under an intermittent two-bottle choice procedure, a cluster of individuals was identified that persisted in drinking alcohol despite adulteration or the availability of an alternative ingestive reinforcer, saccharin. In these rats, that were characterised by decreased GAT-3 mRNA levels in the central amygdala, acute baclofen administration (1.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) resulted in a decrease in compulsive drinking. These results indicate that low GAT-3 mRNA levels in the central amygdala represent an endophenotype of AUD and that the associated compulsive alcohol drinking characteristic is sensitive to baclofen.",

    "abstract": "Histone deacetylase inhibitors, such as valproic acid (VPA), have important clinical therapeutic and cellular reprogramming applications. They induce chromatin re-organization that is associated with altered cellular morphology. However, there is a lack of comprehensive characterization of VPA-induced changes of nuclear size and shape. Here, we quantify 3D nuclear morphology of primary human astrocyte cells treated with VPA over time (hence, 4D). We compared volumetric and surface-based representations and identified seven features that jointly discriminate between normal and treated cells with 85% accuracy on day 7. From day 3, treated nuclei were more elongated and flattened and then continued to morphologically diverge from controls over time, becoming larger and more irregular. On day 7, most of the size and shape descriptors demonstrated significant differences between treated and untreated cells, including a 24% increase in volume and 6% reduction in extent (shape regularity) for treated nuclei. Overall, we show that 4D morphometry can capture how chromatin re-organization modulates the size and shape of the nucleus over time. These nuclear structural alterations may serve as a biomarker for histone (de-)acetylation events and provide insights into mechanisms of astrocytes-to-neurons reprogramming.",

    "abstract": "Sex-specific transcription characterizes hundreds of genes in mouse liver, many implicated in sex-differential drug and lipid metabolism and disease susceptibility. While the regulation of liver sex differences by growth hormone-activated STAT5 is well established, little is known about autosomal genetic factors regulating the sex-specific liver transcriptome. Here we show, using genotyping and expression data from a large population of Diversity Outbred mice, that genetic factors work in tandem with growth hormone to control the individual variability of hundreds of sex-biased genes, including many lncRNA genes. Significant associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms and sex-specific gene expression were identified as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), many of which showed strong sex-dependent associations. Remarkably, autosomal genetic modifiers of sex-specific genes were found to account for more than 200 instances of gain or loss of sex-specificity across eight Diversity Outbred mouse founder strains. Sex-biased STAT5 binding sites and open chromatin regions with strain-specific variants were significantly enriched at eQTL regions regulating correspondingly sex-specific genes, supporting the proposed functional regulatory nature of the eQTL regions identified. Binding of the male-biased, growth hormone-regulated repressor BCL6 was most highly enriched at trans-eQTL regions controlling female-specific genes. Co-regulated gene clusters defined by overlapping eQTLs included sets of highly correlated genes from different chromosomes, further supporting trans-eQTL action. These findings elucidate how an unexpectedly large number of autosomal factors work in tandem with growth hormone signaling pathways to regulate the individual variability associated with sex differences in liver metabolism and disease.\n\nAuthor summaryMale-female differences in liver gene expression confer sex differences in many biological processes relevant to health and disease, including lipid and drug metabolism and liver disease susceptibility. While the role of hormonal factors, most notably growth hormone, in regulating hepatic sex differences is well established, little is known about how autosomal genetic factors impact sex differences on an individual basis. Here, we harness the power of mouse genetics provided by the Diversity Outbred mouse model to discover significant genome-wide associations between genetic variants and sex-specific liver gene expression. Remarkably, we found that autosomal expression quantitative trait loci with a strong sex-bias account for the loss or gain of sex-specific expression of more than 200 autosomal genes seen across eight founder mice strains. Genetic associations with sex-specific genes were enriched for sex-biased and growth hormone-dependent regulatory regions harboring strain-specific genetic variants. Co-regulated gene clusters identified by overlapping regulatory regions included highly correlated genes from different chromosomes. These findings reveal the extensive regulatory role played by autosomal genetic variants, working in tandem with growth hormone signaling pathways, in the transcriptional control of sex-biased genes, many of which have been implicated in sex differential outcomes in liver metabolism and disease susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTIn human lupus nephritis, tubulointerstitial inflammation (TII) is associated with in situ expansion of B cells expressing anti-vimentin antibodies (AVAs). The mechanism by which AVAs are selected is unclear. Herein, we demonstrate that AVA somatic hypermutation and selection increase affinity for vimentin. However, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) suggested that affinity maturation might be a non-specific consequence of increasing polyreactivity. Subsequent multi-color confocal microscopy studies indicated that while TII AVAs often appeared polyreactive by ELISA, they bound selectively to vimentin fibrils in whole cells or inflamed renal tissue. Using a novel machine learning pipeline (CytoSkaler) to quantify the cellular distribution of antibody staining, we demonstrated that TII AVAs were selected for both enhanced binding and specificity in situ. These data suggest a new approach to assess and define antibody polyreactivity based on quantifying the distribution of binding to native and contextually relevant antigens.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Every time we use our smartphone, tablet, or other electronic devices we are exposed to temporal delays between our actions and the sensory feedback. We can compensate for such delays by adjusting our motor commands and doing so likely requires establishing new temporal mappings between motor areas and sensory predictions. However, little is known about the neural underpinnings that would support building new temporal correspondences between different brain areas. We here address the possibility that communication through coherence, which is thought to support neural interareal communication, lies behind the neural processes accounting for how humans cope with additional delays between motor and sensory areas. We recorded EEG activity while participants intercepted moving targets while seeing a cursor that followed their hand with a delay rather than their own hand. Participants adjusted their movements to the delayed visual feedback and intercepted the target with the cursor. The EEG data shows a significant increase in coherence of beta and gamma bands between visual and motor areas during the hand on-going movement towards interception. However, when looking at differences between participants depending on the level of adaptation, only the increase in gamma band correlated with the level of temporal adaptation. We are able to describe the time course of the coherence using coupled oscillators showing that the times at which high coherence is achieved are within useful ranges to solve the task. Altogether, these results evidence the functional relevance of brain coherence in a complex task where adapting to new delays is crucial.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYHumans are often exposed to delays between their actions and the incoming sensory feedback caused by actions. While there have been advances in the understanding of the conditions at which temporal adaptation can occur, little is known about the neural mechanisms enabling temporal adaptation. In the present study we measure brain activity (EEG) to investigate whether communication through coherence between motor and sensory areas might be responsible for ones ability to cope with externally imposed delays in an interception task. We show evidence that neural coherence at gamma band between visual and motor areas is related to the degree of adaptation to temporal delays.",

We hypothesized that the available anti-fibrotic agents, pirfenidone and nintedanib, may exhibit synergy in suppressing lung fibroblast extracellular matrix protein generation when administered in combination with other orally active agents.\n\nMaterials and MethodsA fibroblastic cell line (AKR-2B) was stimulated with TGF-{beta}1 and used to screen a library of over 1500 FDA approved drugs. Extracellular matrix protein generation was assessed via fibronectin ELISA assay and maintenance of cell viability confirmed with XTT assay.\n\nResultsThe screening revealed sixty-two drugs from the repurposed drug-screening library that were shown to significantly suppress fibronectin expression and not result in cell death. Specifically drugs within the category of NSAIDs, steroids, azole antifungal agents, and antipyrine were associated with significant suppression of fibronectin on ELISA analysis. Surprisingly, we observed anti-fibrotic activity across a number of the azole antifungal compounds. We next assessed whether combination of azoles would exhibit synergy when combined with current anti-fibrotic therapies in the stimulated fibroblasts. As proof of concept, we demonstrated in vitro synergy between oxiconazole and nintedanib in suppressing fibroblast generation of extracellular matrix fibronectin.\n\nConclusionsThese results suggest an approach to identify potential combinations of therapy that may improve patient outcomes by reducing cost and potential toxicities during treatment.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTMost B cell lymphomas originate from B cells that have germinal center (GC) experience and bear chromosome translocations and numerous point mutations. GCs B cells remodel their immunoglobulin (Ig) genes by somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR) in their immunoglobulin (Ig) genes. Activation Induced Deaminase (AID) initiates CSR and SHM by generating U:G mismatches on Ig DNA that can then be processed by Uracyl-N-glycosylase (UNG). AID promotes collateral damage in the form of chromosome translocations and off-target SHM, however, the exact contribution of AID activity to lymphoma generation and progression is not completely understood. Here we show using a conditional knock-in strategy that AID supraactivity alone is not sufficient to generate B cell transformation. In contrast, in the absence of UNG, AID supra-expression increases SHM and promotes lymphoma. Whole exome sequencing revealed that AID heavily contributes to lymphoma SHM, promoting subclonal variability and a wider range of oncogenic variants. Thus, our data provide direct evidence that UNG is a brake to AID-induced intratumoral heterogeneity and evolution of B cell lymphoma.View Full Text",

We employed functional protein arrays to identify molecular changes induced in a human bronchial epithelial cell line (HBEC3-KT) and osteosarcoma cell line (U2OS) and evaluated their impact on outcomes associated with radiation induced genomic instability (RIGI) at day 5 and 7 post-exposure to a 2Gy X-ray dose, which revealed replication stress in the context of increased FOXM1 expression. Irradiated cells had reduced DNA replication rate detected by the DNA fiber assay and increased DNA resection detected by RPA foci and phosphorylation. Irradiated cells increased utilization of homologous recombination-dependent repair detected by a gene conversion assay and DNA damage at mitosis reflected by RPA positive chromosomal bridges, micronuclei formation and 53BP1 positive bodies in G1, all known outcomes of replication stress. Interference with the function of FOXM1, a transcription factor widely expressed in cancer, employing an aptamer, decreased radiation-induced micronuclei formation and cell transformation while plasmid-driven overexpression of FOXM1b was sufficient to induce replication stress, micronuclei formation and cell transformation.",

    "abstract": "Responses to drought within a single species may vary based on plant development stage, drought severity, and the avoidance or tolerance mechanisms employed. Early drought stress can restrict emergence and seedling growth. Thus, in areas where water availability is limited, rapid germination leading to early plant establishment may be beneficial. Alternatively, germination without sufficient water to support the seedling may lead to early senescence, so reduced germination under low moisture conditions may be adaptive at the level of the population. We studied the germination response to osmotic stress of diverse chile pepper germplasm collected in southern Mexico from varied ecozones, cultivation systems, and of named landraces. Drought stress was simulated using polyethylene glycol solutions. Overall, survival time analysis revealed delayed germination at the 20% concentration of PEG across all ecozones. The effect was most pronounced in the genotypes from hotter, drier ecozones. Additionally, accessions from wetter and cooler ecozones had the fastest rate of germination. Moreover, accessions of the landraces Costeno Rojo and Tusta germinated more slowly and incompletely if sourced from a drier ecozone than a wetter one, indicating that slower, reduced germination under drought stress may be an adaptive avoidance mechanism. Significant differences were also observed between named landraces, with more domesticated types from intensive cultivation systems nearly always germinating faster than small-fruited backyard- or wild-types, perhaps due to the fact that the smaller-fruited accessions have generally undergone less selection. Thus, we conclude that there is evidence of local adaptation to both ecozone of origin and source cultivation system in germination characteristics of diverse chile peppers.",

    "abstract": "Resting CD4+ T cells do not support HIV replication in vitro, yet are primary targets of early HIV infection events in vivo. There is an established role for factors in the tissue microenvironment, including endothelial cells, in enhancing the susceptibility of resting CD4+ T cells to productive infection, yet the mechanisms behind this are not well understood. Endothelial cells facilitate immune cell trafficking throughout the body. Cell adhesion molecules expressed by endothelial cells engage integrins on activated and memory T cells and mediate transmigration into inflamed tissues. These cell trafficking pathways have overlapping roles in facilitating HIV replication but their relevance to endothelial cell-mediated enhancement of HIV susceptibility in resting CD4+ T cells has not previously been examined. We used flow cytometry to characterize the phenotype resting CD4+ T cells that became productively infected when exposed to HIV in the presence of endothelial cells. Infected CD4+ T cells were primarily central memory cells enriched for high expression of the integrins LFA-1 and VLA-4 and had variable expression of \u03b14\u03b27, CCR6 and CD69. Blocking LFA-1 and VLA-4 on resting CD4+ T cells abrogated infection in the co-culture model, indicating that engagement of these integrins is essential for enhancement of resting CD4+ T cell HIV susceptibility by endothelial cells. Cellular activation of CD4+ T cells did not appear to be the primary mechanism enabling HIV replication since only a small proportion of resting CD4+ T cells became activated over the course of the co-culture and fewer than half of infected cells had an activated phenotype. The demonstration that endothelial cells enhance the cellular HIV susceptibility of resting memory CD4+ T cells through cell trafficking pathways engaged during the transmigration of memory T cells into inflamed tissues highlights the physiological relevance of these findings for HIV acquisition and opportunities for intervention.Author Summary HIV acquisition risk per coital act is relatively low, but this risk is amplified by various behavioural and biological variables. Genital inflammation is a key biological variable associated with increased risk of HIV acquisition, but the mechanisms driving this are incompletely understood. Inflammation is a complex process, with direct effects on HIV target cells as well as the tissue in which those cells reside and encounter virus. The first HIV target cells in vivo are resting memory CD4+ T cells, yet these cells are do not support viral replication when purified and exposed to HIV in vitro. Rather, signals from tissue microenvironment are required to support viral replication within resting memory CD4+ T cells. Endothelial cells line tissue vasculature and guide immune cell trafficking to inflamed tissues through engagement of integrins by endothelial-expressed cell adhesion molecules. We show here that these same cell-trafficking pathways enable endothelial cells to promote HIV replication within resting memory CD4+ T cells in vitro. Blockade of integrins on resting memory CD4+ T cells prevented endothelial enhancement of HIV infection. These findings further our understanding of the determinants of cellular susceptibility to HIV infection and offer a potential mechanism by which inflammation promotes HIV acquisition.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Background Recently, some researchers have reported that PIgR expression is down-regulated in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and SIgA deficiency correlates with severity of airflow obstruction. What\u2019 s more, some studies have demonstrated that 2 percent of hydrogen or hydrogen water is effective in treating and preventing various diseases.Objectives The aim of this study was to observe the effect of hydrogen on the expression of SIgA, PIgR, IL-4, IL-5, TGF-\u03b21 and IL-40 in lung tissue of COPD rats, to study the relationship between lung pathology parameter and SIgA, PIgR, therefore we can understand the effect of hydrogen on the development of COPD by changing SIgA expression of airway mucosal in COPD rats.Methods A rat model of COPD was established by cigarette smoke exposure, and different concentrations of hydrogen were inhaled as intervention measures. After 4 months of cigarette smoke exposure, pathologic changes and airway wall remodeling of the lung were assessed by optical microscope. The protein expressions of SIgA, PIgR, IL-4, IL-5, TGF-\u03b21 as well as IL-40 in the lung tissues were observed by immunohistochemistry or Western blot. The correlation between lung pathology parameter and the expression of SIgA, PIgR was analyzed. The correlation between SIgA and the expression of IL-4, IL-5, TGF-\u03b21 and IL-40 was analyzed.Results The results showed that hydrogen inhalation significantly ameliorated lung pathology and airway wall remodeling, increased the protein expression of SIgA, PIgR, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-40, and reduced the protein expression of TGF-\u03b21.Conclusions Inhalation of 22% and 41.6% hydrogen showed a better effect than inhalation of 2% hydrogen. Hydrogen inhalation can significantly improve the expression of SIgA on the mucosal surface of COPD rats, which may be one of the mechanisms which hydrogen works on COPD pathogenesis.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Sex chromosomes of eutherian mammals are highly different in size and gene content, and share only a small region of homology (pseudoautosomal region, PAR). They are thought to have evolved through an addition-attrition cycle involving the addition of autosomal segments to sex chromosomes and their subsequent differentiation. The events that drive this process are difficult to investigate because sex chromosomes in most mammals are at a very advanced stage of differentiation. Here, we have taken advantage of a recent translocation of an autosome to both sex chromosomes in the African pygmy mouse Mus minutoides, which has restored a large segment of homology (neo-PAR). By studying meiotic sex chromosome behavior and identifying fully sex-linked genetic markers in the neo-PAR, we demonstrate that this region shows unequivocal signs of early sex-differentiation. First, synapsis and resolution of DNA damage intermediates are delayed in the neo-PAR during meiosis. Second, recombination is suppressed in a large portion of the neo-PAR. However, the inactivation process that characterizes sex chromosomes during meiosis does not extend to this region. Finally, the sex chromosomes show a dual mechanism of association at metaphase-I that involves the formation of a chiasma in the neo-PAR and the preservation of an ancestral achiasmate mode of association in the non-homologous segments. We show that the study of meiosis is crucial to apprehend the onset of sex chromosome differentiation, as it introduces structural and functional constrains to sex chromosome evolution. Synapsis and DNA repair dynamics are the first processes affected in the incipient differentiation of X and Y chromosomes, and they may be involved in accelerating their evolution. This provides one of the very first reports of early steps in neo-sex chromosome differentiation in mammals, and for the first time a cellular framework for the addition-attrition model of sex chromosome evolution.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe early steps in the evolution of sex chromosomes are particularly difficult to study. Cessation of recombination around the sex-determining locus is thought to initiate the differentiation of sex chromosomes. Several studies have investigated this process from a genetic point of view. However, the cellular context in which recombination arrest occurs has not been considered as an important factor. In this report, we show that meiosis, the cellular division in which pairing and recombination between chromosomes takes place, can affect the incipient differentiation of X and Y chromosomes. Combining cytogenetic and genomic approaches, we found that in the African pygmy mouse Mus minutoides, which has recently undergone a sex chromosome-autosome fusion, synapsis and DNA repair dynamics are altered along the newly added region of the sex chromosomes, likely interfering with recombination and thus contributing to the genetic isolation of a large segment of the Y chromosome. Therefore, the cellular events that occur during meiosis are crucial to understand the very early stages of sex chromosome differentiation. This can help to explain why sex chromosomes evolve very fast in some organisms while in others they have barely changed for million years.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine the consequence of uterine apoptotic caspase-3 activation on day 1 post coitus (dpc) in the pregnant mouse. We previously demonstrated that during pregnancy uterine caspase-3 activation isolated to the myometrial compartment is largely non-apoptotic and controls uterine quiescence. In this study we determined that uterine caspase-3 activation on 1 dpc may play a critical role in regulating endometrial PGE2 synthesis though iPLA2 activation. These analyses provide novel insight into the molecular mechanisms that regulate previously reported increases in endometrial PGE2 synthesis in very early pregnancy, that act to enhance uterine receptivity.\n\nWe have identified the site and impact of that uterine apoptotic caspase-3 activation utilizing uteri isolated from non-pregnant control animals at estrous and diestrous and from control pregnant mice at 1-19 dpc. In addition, uteri were isolated from non-ligated controls (GD), unilateral (UL) and bilateral ligated (BL) uterine horn mouse models at 1, 3 and 6 dpc. Uteri were examined for apoptotic indices, such as caspase-3 activation and TUNEL staining. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to identify the site of apoptotic caspase-3 activation. The presence of the truncated form of phospholipase A2 (tiPLA2) was examined as a measure of apoptotic caspase-3 mediated iPLA2 activation.\n\nOur analysis determined that apoptotic caspase-3 and iPLA2 activation were limited to the endometrial compartments of the control and unilateral uteri on 1dpc and were not found in the bilateral ligated uterine horn on 3 or 6 dpc. Our data indicates that the presence of a conceptus on 1 dpc triggers an increase in endometrial apoptotic caspase-3 mediated iPLA2 activation. iPLA2 when activated causes the hydrolysis of fatty acids resulting in arachidonic acid release and production of PGE2, which in early pregnancy has been demonstrated to act in a leutoprotective manner, prolonging progesterone synthesis and promoting uterine receptivity.",

    "abstract": "A large series of dipeptides containing sulfur groups and antimony SbV were modeled to understand their inhibitor activity against Leishmaniasis. The trypanothione reductase (TR), which acts as a reducing agent in several vital processes, is responsible for maintaining the parasite\u2019s cellular thiol redox balance. The antimonic SbV acid (Sb2O5\u00b7nH2O) is being evaluated as a drug with inhibitory activity against Leishmaniasis. In the present work, we investigated the inhibitory effect of antimony oxide on (TR) activity modeled as a substrate by probing two model clusters in gas phase and continuum water medium: A [(Sb2O10H8)]\u22122 coordinated to cysteine, and B [Sb7O28H21] coordinated to trypanothione, including glucose adduct. We report here density functional theory (DFT and DFT-D3) using (B3LYP/LANL2DZ and (TPSS/def2TZVP) results on the binding energy of cysteine and trypanthione complexed to these clusters as possible sites promoting the inhibition process. Upon viewing the results of the computational studies of cluster models and theoretical thermochemistry data for receptor-substrate interactions, identification of ligand-cluster interactions helps to unravel the mechanism of inhibition. The acidity of (Sb2O5,nH2O) leads to great cluster-dipeptide passivation. The electrostatic forces between cluster interface and dipeptide interaction present relevant inhibition effects through proton transfer or mobility from the different amine and ketone groups. The reactivity differences come from the unoccupied lone pairs 5pSb which lie at higher energy but remain available to make a good interaction with the lowest orbital p nitrogen in NH2, and in the CO groups substrate fragment in the zone HOMO-LUMO. Further cluster stability comparisons show a lower Gibbs free energy in B3 (B/trypanthione/glucose) (18 \u2013 30 kcal/mol) at both used level in this study and gives good accurate intramolecular interactions, confirmed by the use of the dispersion-corrected density functional (DFT-D3). Given the dipeptide H-mobility and the (Sb2O5,nH2O) cluster acidity, (donor-acceptor duality), the system is predicted to be potent cluster of the inhibitors by endothermic and spontaneous reaction requiring 3.10 kcal/mol in aqueous medium.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Developmental, cellular, and subcellular variations in the direction of neuronal Cl- currents elicited by GABAA receptor activation have been frequently reported, and we found a corresponding variance in the reversal potential (EGABA) for individual interneurons synapsing on a single pyramidal cell. These findings suggest a corresponding variance in the cytoplasmic concentration of Cl- ([Cl-i]). We determined [Cl-]i by: 1) two-photon imaging of the Cl- sensitive, ratiometric fluorescent protein SuperClomeleon (sCLM); 2) Fluorescence Lifetime IMaging (FLIM) of the Cl- sensitive fluorophore MEQ; and 3) electrophysiological measurements of EGABA. These methods collectively demonstrated stable [Cl-]i microdomains in individual neurons in vivo. Fluorometric and electrophysiological estimates of local [Cl-]i were highly correlated. [Cl-]i microdomains persisted after pharmacological inhibition of cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs) but steadily decreased after inhibiting the polymerization of the anionic macromolecule actin. These studies highlight the existence of functionally significant neuronal Cl- microdomains that modify the impact of GABAergic inputs.",

    "abstract": "The BTB-Kelch protein KLHL3 is a Cullin3-dependent E3 ligase that mediates the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of kinases WNK1-4 to control blood pressure and cell volume. A crystal structure of KLHL3 has defined its binding to an acidic degron motif containing a PXXP sequence that is strictly conserved in WNK1, WNK2 and WNK4. Mutations in the second proline abrograte the interaction causing the hypertension syndrome pseudohypoaldosteronism type II. WNK3 shows a diverged degron motif containing 4 amino acid substitutions that remove the PXXP motif raising questions as to the mechanism of its binding. To understand this atypical interaction, we determined the crystal structure of the KLHL3 Kelch domain in complex with a WNK3 peptide. The electron density enabled the complete 11-mer WNK-family degron motif to be traced for the first time revealing several conserved features not captured in previous work, including additional salt bridge and hydrogen bond interactions. Overall, the WNK3 peptide adopted a conserved binding pose except for a subtle shift to accommodate bulkier amino acid substitutions at the binding interface. At the centre, the second proline was substituted by WNK3 Thr541, providing a unique phosphorylatable residue among the WNK-family degrons. Fluorescence polarisation and structural modelling experiments revealed that its phosphorylation would abrogate the KLHL3 interaction similarly to hypertension-causing mutations. Together, these data reveal how the KLHL3 Kelch domain can accommodate the binding of multiple WNK isoforms and highlight a potential regulatory mechanism for the recruitment of WNK3.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.AbbreviationsBTBBric-a-brac, Tramtrack, and Broad complexCCTConserved C-terminalCRL3Cullin3-dependent RING E3 ligaseDMEMDulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s mediumDTTDithiothreitolFBSfetal bovine serumGSTGlutathione S-transferaseHCDHigher-energy collisional dissociationHEK293Thuman embryonic kidney 293 cell line expressing the SV40 large T antigenKCCK+/Cl\u2212 co-transportersIPTGIsopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranosideKLHL3Kelch-like protein 3LC/MSLiquid chromatography-mass spectrometryN[K]CCNa+/Cl\u2212 ion co-transportersNKCC2Na+/K+/2Cl\u2212 co-transporter 2OSR1oxidative stress-responsive kinase 1PDBProtein DatabankPHAIIpseudohypoaldosteronism type IIRINGreally interesting new geneSPAKSPS1-related proline/alanine-rich kinaseTCEPtris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphineTEVtobacco etch virusWNKwith no lysine (K) kinaseView Full Text",
