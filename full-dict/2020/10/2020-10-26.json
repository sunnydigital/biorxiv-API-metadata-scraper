    "abstract": "The avian eye color, generally referred to the color of the iris, results from both pigments and structural coloration. Avian iris colors exhibit striking interspecific and, in some domestic species, intraspecific variations, suggesting unique evolutionary and ecological histories. Here we tackled the genetic basis of the pearl (white) iris color in domestic pigeons (Columba livia), to elucidate the largely unknown genetic mechanism underlying the evolution of avian iris coloration. Using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 92 pigeons, we mapped the pearl iris trait to a 9 kb region and a facilitative glucose transporter gene SLC2A11B. A nonsense mutation W49X leading to a premature stop codon in SLC2A11B was identified as the causal variant. Transcriptome analysis suggested that SLC2A11B loss-of-function may downregulate the xanthophore-differentiation gene CSF1R, and a key gene GCH1 involved in biosynthesis of pteridine, whose absence results in pearl iris. Coalescence and phylogenetic analyses indicated the mutation originated about 5,400 years ago coinciding with the onset of pigeon domestication, while positive selection was detected likely associated with artificial breeding. Within Aves, potentially impaired SLC2A11B was found in 10 species from six distinct lineages correlated to their signature brown or blue eyes. Analysis of vertebrate SLC2A11B orthologs revealed relaxed selection in the avian clade, consistent with the scenario that, during and after avian divergence from reptile ancestor, the SLC2A11B-involved development of dermal chromatophores likely degenerated due to feather coverage. Our findings provide new insight into the mechanism of avian iris color variations and the evolution of pigmentation in vertebrates.",

    "abstract": "SummaryPost-GWAS studies using the results from large consortium meta-analysis often need to correctly take care of the overlapping sample issue. The gold standard approach for resolving this issue is to reperform the GWAS or meta-analysis excluding the overlapped participants. However, such approach is time-consuming and, sometimes, restricted by the available data. deMeta provides a user friendly and computationally efficient command-line implementation for removing the effect of a contributing sub-study to a consortium from the meta-analysis results. Only the summary statistics of the meta-analysis the sub-study to be removed are required. In addition, deMeta can generate contrasting Manhattan and quantile-quantile plots for users to visualize the impact of the sub-study on the meta-analysis results.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationThe python source code, examples and documentations of deMeta are publicly available at https://github.com/Computational-NeuroGenetics/deMeta-beta.\n\nContactjiangming.sun@med.lu.se (J.

    "abstract": "Phytophthora cinnamomi is a pathogenic oomycete that causes plant dieback disease across a range of natural ecosystems and in many agriculturally important crops on a global scale. An annotated draft genome sequence and annotation is publicly available (JGI Mycocosm) and suggests 26,131 gene models. In this study, soluble mycelial, extracellular (secretome) and zoospore proteins of P. cinnamomi were exploited to refine the genome by correcting gene annotations and discovering novel genes. By implementing the diverse set of sub-proteomes into a generated proteogenomics pipeline, we were able to improve the P. cinnamomi genome. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry was used to obtain high confidence peptides with spectral matching to both the annotated genome and a generated 6-frame translation. 2,764 annotations from the draft genome were confirmed by spectral matching. Using a proteogenomic pipeline, mass spectra were used to edit the P. cinnamomi genome and allowed identification of 23 new gene models and 60 edited gene features using high confidence peptides obtained by mass spectrometry, suggesting a rate of incorrect annotations of 3% of the detectable proteome. The novel features were further validated by total peptide support, alongside functional analysis including the use of Gene Ontology and functional domain identification. We demonstrated the use of spectral data in combination with our proteogenomics pipeline can be used to improve the genome of important plant diseases and identify biologically relevant missed genes. This study presents the first use of spectral data to edit and manually annotate an oomycete pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Bullying events during adolescence are common, yet it remains largely unclear which kinds of behavioral patterns are more likely to result in being exploited. Leveraging recent advances in computational modeling and experimental economics, this study examines whether being nice or tough during early social interactions will impact future interactions. Adolescents were randomly assigned to play a cooperation game with two different simulated partners. We found that participants were more likely to cooperate with the initially tough partner than with the initially nice partner. Computational modeling revealed that behavioral changes were driven by changes in perceived social rewards from reciprocity. Perceived social rewards mediated the effects of different partners on the participants cooperative behaviors. The results indicate that being nice is not a good strategy for building social cooperation, and advance our knowledge of how adolescents form sustained social relationships with peers and may have implications for the education field.\n\nStatement of RelevanceBullying events in high school have been extremely common across cultures. Most studies focus on the modulations of adolescents behaviors by a specific factor, e.g., education, parenting style or psychological distorter. Our study examines a more general question: whether and how the way of adolescents exhibit themselves would dynamically influence the way that other people treat them. Our findings suggest that being nice initially is not a good strategy for building social cooperation. Being nice early in a relationship will weaken the value of reciprocity perceived by others, which in turn results in being exploited. We regard our work as being of significance for the fields of psychological science, education and human morality. This study advances our knowledge of how adolescents form sustained social relationships with their peers, and it may have implications for the education field.",

    "abstract": "The capacity to inhibit prepotent actions (inhibitory self-control) plays an important role in many aspects of the behaviour of birds and mammals. Although a number of studies have used it as an index of foraging skills, inhibition is, in fact, also crucial for maintaining the temporal and spatial coherence of bonded social groups. Using two sets of comparative data, we show that, in primates, the capacity to inhibit behaviour correlates better with the demands of social contexts than the demands of foraging contexts, whereas a more generalised capacity for causal reasoning correlates with both social and foraging contexts. In addition, we confirm the Passingham-Wise Conjecture that the capacity to inhibit prepotent action is unique to anthropoid primates, and suggest that it may be crucial for the spatio-temporal integrity of their unique bonded social groups.",

Even when protein-protein docking samples correct models, current scoring functions struggle to discriminate them from incorrect decoys. The previous incorporation of conservation and coevolution information has shown promise for improving protein-protein scoring. Here, we present a novel strategy to integrate atomic-level evolutionary information into different types of scoring functions to improve their docking discrimination.\n\nWe applied this general strategy to our residue-level statistical potential from InterEvScore and to two atomic-level scores, SOAP-PP and Rosetta interface score (ISC). Including evolutionary information from as few as ten homologous sequences improves the top 10 success rates of these individual scores by respectively 6.5, 6 and 13.5 percentage points, on a large benchmark of 752 docking cases. The best individual homology-enriched score reaches a top 10 success rate of 34.4%. A consensus approach based on the complementarity between different homology-enriched scores further increases the top 10 success rate to 40%.\n\nAll data used for benchmarking and scoring results, as well as pipelining scripts, are available at http://biodev.cea.fr/interevol/interevdata/",

Nonetheless, for up to 15-25% of genes per genome the gene start predictions might differ even when made by the supposedly most accurate tools. To address this discrepancy, we have introduced StartLink+, an approach combining ab initio and multiple sequence alignment based methods. StartLink+ makes predictions for a majority of genes per genome (73% on average); in tests on sets of genes with experimentally verified starts the StartLink+ accuracy was shown to be 98-99%. When StartLink+ predictions made for a large set of prokaryotic genomes were compared with the database annotations we observed that on average the gene start annotations deviated from the predictions for ~5% of genes in AT-rich genomes and for 10-15% of genes in GC-rich genomes.",

Projecting immune cells from external tumors onto the atlas facilitated an automated cell annotation system for a harmonized interpretation.

    "abstract": "Platinum-based chemotherapy remains widely used in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) despite its ineffectiveness in long-term control of metastasis.\n\nHere, we uncover the interconnected pathways subtending cisplatin-induced metastasis promotion.\n\nWe report that cisplatin treatment of tumor-free mice results in bone-marrow expansion of CCR2+CXCR4+Ly6Chigh inflammatory monocytes (IM) concomitantly with increased levels in the lungs of stromal SDF-1, the CXCR4 ligand. In experimental metastasis assays, cisplatin-induced IM favor tumor cells extravasation and expansion of CD133+CXCR4+ metastasis initiating cells (MICs), facilitating lung metastasis formation. At the primary tumor, cisplatin reduces tumor size but induces tumor release of SDF-1 triggering MICs expansion and recruitment of pro-invasive CXCR4+ macrophages. Co-recruitment of MICs and CCR2+CXCR4+ IM at SDF-1-enriched distant sites also promotes spontaneous metastasis. Combination treatment with a CXCR4 inhibitor prevents cisplatin-induced IM/MICs recruitment and interaction thus precluding metastasis overgrowth. Finally, we observe in NSCLC patients specimens that SDF-1 levels are higher in platinum-treated samples and correlate with worse outcome.\n\nOur findings suggest a possible novel combination therapy based on CXCR4 blockade to control metastatic disease, paradoxically promoted by cisplatin.",

    "abstract": "Hypersaline environments are the source of many viruses infecting different species of halophilic euryarchaea. Information on infection mechanisms of archaeal viruses is scarce, due to the lack of genetically accessible virus-host models. Recently a new archaeal siphovirus, Haloferax tailed virus 1 (HFTV1), was isolated together with its host belonging to the genus Haloferax, but it is not infectious on the widely used model euryarcheon Hfx. volcanii. To gain more insight into the biology of HFTV1 host strain LR2-5, we studied characteristics that might play a role in its virus susceptibility: growth-dependent motility, surface layer, filamentous surface structures and cell shape. Its genome sequence showed that LR2-5 is a new strain of Hfx. gibbonsii. LR2-5 lacks obvious viral defense systems, such as CRISPR-Cas, and the composition of its cell surface is different from Hfx. volcanii, which might explain the different viral host range. This work provides first deep insights into the relationship between the host of halovirus HFTV1 and other members of the genus Haloferax. Given the close relationship to the genetically accessible Hfx. volcanii, LR2-5 has high potential as a new model for virus-host studies in euryarchaea.",

Our approach identified a C-terminal fragment of Cystatin C (CysC95-146) that specifically inhibits GPR15-dependent HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV infection. In contrast, GPR15L, the chemokine ligand of GPR15, failed to inhibit virus infection. We found that Cystatin C fragments preventing GPR15-mediated viral entry do not interfere with GPR15L signaling and are generated by proteases activated at sites of inflammation. The antiretroviral activity of CysC95-146 was confirmed in primary CD4+ T cells and is conserved in simian hosts of SIV infection. Thus, we identified a potent endogenous inhibitor of GPR15-mediated HIV and SIV infection that does not interfere with the physiological function of this G protein-coupled receptor.",

    "abstract": "Identifying human sewage contamination via microbial source tracking (MST) marker genes has proven useful for effective water quality management worldwide; however, performance evaluations for these genes in tropical areas are limited. Therefore, this research assessed four human-associated MST marker genes in aquatic environments of Central Thailand: human polyomaviruses (JC and BK viruses [HPyVs]), bacteriophage crAssphage (CPQ_056), Lachnospiraceae Lachno3, and Bacteroides BacV6-21. HPyV and crAssphage assays were highly sensitive and specific to sewage (n = 19), with no cross-detection in 120 swine, cattle, chicken, duck, goat, sheep, and buffalo composite fecal samples. Lachno3 and BacV6-21 demonstrated high sensitivity but moderate specificity; however, using both markers could improve specificity to >0.80 (max value of 1.00). The most abundant markers in sewage were Lachno3 and BacV6-21 (5.42-8.02 and non-detected-8.05 log10 copies/100 mL), crAssphage (5.28-7.38 log10 copies/100 mL), and HPyVs (3.66-6.53 log10 copies/100 mL), respectively. HPyVs showed higher levels (up to 4.33 log10 copies/100 mL) and higher detection rates (92.7%) in two coastal beaches (n = 41) than crAssphage (up to 3.51 log10 copies/100 mL and 56.1%). HPyVs were also found at slightly lower levels (up to 5.10 log10 copies/100 mL), but at higher detection rates (92.6%), in a freshwater canal (n = 27) than crAssphage (up to 5.21 log10 copies/100 mL and 88.9%). Overall, both HPyVs and crAssphage are suggested as human sewage-associated MST markers in aquatic environments of Central Thailand. This study underlines the importance of characterizing and validating MST markers in host groups and environmental waters before including them in a water quality management toolbox.",

    "abstract": "Most of current cardiac regenerative approaches result in very limited cell division. Positive feedback loops are vital for cell division, but their role in CM regeneration remains unclear. We aimed to demonstrate that lncRNA Snhg1 formed a positive feedback loop with c-Myc to induce stable CM cytokinesis. We found that Snhg1 expression was increased in human and mouse fetal and myocardial infarction (MI) hearts, particularly in CMs. Snhg1 overexpression elicited stable CM proliferation and improved post-MI cardiac function. Antagonism of Snhg1 in neonatal mice inhibited CM proliferation and impaired cardiac repair after MI. Proliferative effect was confirmed using cardiac-specific transgenic mice. RNA pull-down assays showed that Snhg1 directly bound to PTEN and activated PI3K-Akt pathway, resulting in c-Myc activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that Snhg1 expression was upregulated by c-Myc binding to the Snhg1 promoter region, indicating a positive feedback loop between c-Myc and Snhg1. In conclusion, c-Myc/Snhg1/PI3k-Akt positive feedback loop drove sustained activation of cell cycle re-entry and induced stable CM cytokinesis, and thus may be an attractive strategy for promoting heart regenerative response.\n\nClinical PerspectivesMost of the current cardiac regenerative approaches result in very limited cell division and little new cardiomyocyte (CM) mass. Positive feedback loops are vital for cell division, but their role in CM regeneration remain unclear. Here, we identified the long noncoding RNA Snhg1 as a driver to induce stable CM division and improve cardiac function after myocardial infarction (MI) by forming a positive feedback loop to sustain PI3K-Akt signaling activation. This finding might provide a novel therapeutic of Snhg1 as a promising regenerative approach to improve the prognosis of patients with heart failure.",

    "abstract": "Decontamination is necessary for eliminating the effect of foreign genomes on the symbiont studies and biomedical discoveries. However, direct extraction of host sequencing reads with no references remains challenging. Here, we present a triobased method to classify the host error-prone long reads or sparse co-barcoded reads prior to assembly, free of any alignments against DNA or protein references. This method first identifies high-confident host reads by haplotype-specific k-mers inherited from parents, and then groups remaining host reads by the unsupervised clustering. Experimental results demonstrated that this approach successfully classified up to 97.38% of the host human long reads with the precision rate of 99.9999%, and 79.95% host co-barcoded reads with the precision rate of 98.36% using an artificially mixed data. Moreover, the tool also exhibited a good performance on the decontamination of the real algae data. The purified reads reconstructed two haplotypes and improved the assembly with larger contig NGA50 value and less misassemblies.

    "abstract": "Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is a rare but lethal cancer with rising incidence in several global hotspots including the United States. The five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with advanced disease can be as low as 5% in EAC, making early detection and preventive intervention crucial. The current standard of care for EAC targets patients with Barretts esophagus (BE), the main precursor to EAC and a relatively common condition in adults with chronic acid reflux disease. Preventive care for EAC requires repeated surveillance endoscopies of BE patients with biopsy sampling, and can be intrusive, error-prone, and costly. The integration of minimally-invasive subsurface tissue imaging in the current standard of care can reduce the need for exhaustive tissue sampling and improve the quality of life in BE patients. Effective adoption of subsurface imaging in EAC care can be facilitated by computer-aided detection (CAD) systems based on deep learning. Despite their recent successes in lung and breast cancer imaging, the development of deep neural networks for rare conditions like EAC remains challenging due to data scarcity, heavy bias in existing datasets toward non-cases, and uncertainty in image labels. Here we explore the use of synthetic datasets-specifically data derived from simulations of optical back-scattering during imaging- in the development of CAD systems based on deep learning. As a proof of concept, we studied the binary classification of esophageal OCT into normal squamous and glandular mucosae, typical of BE. We found that deep convolutional networks trained on synthetic data had improved performance over models trained on clinical datasets with uncertain labels. Model performance also improved with dataset size during training on synthetic data. Our findings demonstrate the utility of transfer from simulations to real data in the context of medical imaging, especially in the severely data-poor regime and when significant uncertainty in labels are present, and motivate further development of transfer learning from simulations to aid the development of CAD for rare malignancies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThere are few (if any) practical guidelines for predictive and falsifiable multi-omics data integration that systematically integrate existing knowledge. Disease modules are popular concepts for interpreting genome-wide studies in medicine but have so far not been systematically evaluated and may lead to corroborating multi-omic modules.\n\nMethodsWe assessed eight module identification methods in 57 previously published expression and methylation studies of 19 diseases using GWAS enrichment analysis. Next, we applied the same strategy for multi-omics integration of 19 datasets of multiple sclerosis (MS), and further validated the resulting module using both GWAS and risk-factor associated genes from several independent cohorts.\n\nResultsOur benchmark of modules showed that in immune-associated diseases modules inferred from clique-based methods were the most enriched for GWAS-genes. The multi-omics case study using MS revealed the robust identification of a module of 220 genes. Strikingly, most genes of the module was differentially methylated upon the action of one or several environmental risk factors in MS (n = 217, P = 10-47) and were also independently validated for association with five different risk factors of MS, which further stressed the high genetic and epigenetic relevance of the module for MS.\n\nConclusionWe believe our analysis provides a workflow for selecting modules and our benchmark study may help further improvement of disease module methods. Moreover, we also stress that our methodology is generally applicable for combining and assessing the performance of multi-omics approaches for complex diseases.",

    "abstract": "Acinetobacter baumannii is of major clinical importance as the bacterial pathogen often causes hospital acquired infections, further complicated by the high prevalence of antibiotic resistant strains. Aside from natural tolerance to certain antibiotic classes, resistance is often acquired by the exchange of genetic information via conjugation but also by the high natural competence exhibited by A. baumannii. In addition, bacteriophages are able to introduce resistance genes but also toxins and virulence factors via phage mediated transduction. In this work, we analysed the complete genomes of 177 A. baumannii strains for the occurrence of prophages, and analysed their taxonomy, size and positions of insertion. Among all the prophages that were detected, Siphoviridae and Myoviridae were the two most commonly found families, while the average genome size was determined as 3.98 Mbp. Our data shows the wide variation in the number of prophages in A. baumannii genomes and the prevalence of certain prophages within strains that are most \"successful\" or potentially beneficial to the host. Our study also revealed that only two specific sites of insertion within the genome of the host bacterium are being used, with few exceptions only. Lastly, we analysed the existence of genes that are encoded in the prophages, which confer antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Several phages carry AMR genes, including OXA-23 and NDM-1, illustrating the importance of lysogenic phages in the acquisition of resistance genes.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular phase separation of proteins into biomolecular condensates is increasingly recognised as an important phenomenon for cellular compartmentalisation and regulation of biological function. Different hypotheses about the parameters that determine the tendency of proteins to form condensates have been proposed with some of them probed experimentally through the use of constructs generated by sequence alterations. To broaden the scope of these observations, here, we established an in silico strategy for understanding on a global level the associations between protein sequence and condensate formation, and used this information to construct machine learning classifiers for predicting liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) from protein sequence. Our analysis highlighted that LLPS-prone sequences are more disordered, hydrophobic and of lower Shannon entropy than sequences in the Protein Data Bank or the Swiss-Prot database, and have their disordered regions enriched in polar, aromatic and charged residues. Using these determining features together with neural network based word2vec sequence embeddings, we developed machine learning classifiers for predicting protein condensate formation. Our model, trained to distinguish LLPS-prone sequences from structured proteins, achieved high accuracy (93%; 25-fold cross-validation) and identified condensate forming sequences from external independent test data at 97% sensitivity. Moreover, in combination with a classifier that had developed a nuanced insight into the features governing protein phase behaviour by learning to distinguish between sequences of varying LLPS propensity, the sensitivity was supplemented with high specificity (approximated ROC-AUC of 0.85). These results provide a platform rooted in molecular principles for understanding protein phase behaviour. The predictor is accessible from https://deephase.ch.cam.ac.uk/.\n\nSignificance StatementThe tendency of many cellular proteins to form protein-rich biomolecular condensates underlies the formation of subcellular compartments and has been linked to various physiological functions. Understanding the molecular basis of this fundamental process and predicting protein phase behaviour have therefore become important objectives. To develop a global understanding of how protein sequence determines its phase behaviour, here, we constructed bespoke datasets of proteins of varying phase separation propensity and identified explicit biophysical and sequence-specific features common to phase separating proteins. Moreover, by combining this insight with neural network based sequence embeddings, we trained machine learning classifiers that identified phase separating sequences with high accuracy, including from independent external test data. The predictor is available from https://deephase.ch.cam.ac.uk/.",

Determining the role of cell-extrinsic regulators of leukemic cells is vital to gain clinical insights into the biology of AML. Iron is a key extrinsic regulator of cancer but its systemic regulation remains poorly explored in AML. To address this question, we studied iron metabolism in AML patients at diagnosis and mechanisms involved using the syngeneic MLL-AF9-induced AML mouse model. We found that AML is a disorder with a unique iron profile not associated with inflammation or transfusion and characterized by high ferritin, low transferrin, high transferrin saturation (TSAT), and high hepcidin. The increased TSAT in particular, contrasts with observations in other cancer types and in anemia of inflammation. Using the MLL-AF9 mouse model of AML, we demonstrated that leukemic blasts take up iron and that the AML-induced loss of erythroblasts is responsible for iron redistribution and an increase in TSAT. We also show that elevated TSAT at diagnosis is independently associated with increased overall survival in AML and suggest that TSAT may be a relevant prognostic marker in AML.",

Pruritus is the most common skin symptom in patients with chronic kidney disease, especially in end-stage renal disease (AKA chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus [CKD-aP]); however, the underlying molecular and neural mechanism of the CKD-aP in patients remains obscure. Our data show that the level of allantoin increases in the serum of CKD-aP and CKD model mice. Allantoin could induce scratching behavior in mice and active DRG neurons; the calcium influx and the action potential were significantly reduced in DRG neurons of MrgprD KO or TRPV1 KO mice. U73122, an antagonist of PLC, could also block calcium influx in DRG neurons induced by allantoin.

    "abstract": "Based on Eysencks pioneering work, CNS arousal has long been considered an encouraging biological candidate that may explain individual differences in human personality. Yet, results from empirical studies remained inconclusive. Notably, the vast majority of published results have been derived from small samples, and EEG alpha power has usually served as exclusive indicator for CNS arousal. In this study, we selected N = 468 individuals of the LIFE-Adult cohort and investigated the associations between the Big Five personality traits and CNS arousal by using the low-resolution electromagnetic tomography-based analysis tool VIGALL. Our analyses revealed that subjects who reported higher levels of extraversion and openness to experience, respectively, exhibited lower levels of CNS arousal in the resting state. Bayesian and frequentist analysis results were especially convincing for openness to experience. Among the lower-order personality traits, we obtained strongest evidence for neuroticism facet  impulsivity and reduced CNS arousal. We regard these findings as well in line with the postulations of Eysenck and Zuckerman and consistent with the assumptions of the  arousal regulation model. Our results also agree with meta-analytically derived effect sizes in the field of individual differences research, highlighting the need for large studies with at least several hundreds of subjects.",

The Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) is effective to reverse this non-use behaviour in some patients but is inapplicable or unsuccessful on others. Here, we investigate how much non-use could come from shoulder weakness instead of the behavioural conditioning treated by the CIMT. We asked 26 healthy participants to reach a target while holding a dumbbell. We found that 18/26 participants exhibit proximal arm non-use when loaded and that non-use reduces shoulder torque of final posture. We either found that non-use improves accuracy in a high gravity field. Following optimal control policy, we explain how the non-use could be an adaptative solution when the shoulder is weak. Our results show the need to include muscular strength into cost function used to model human movement. The framework presented here suggests that psychological non-use could be treated effectively with CIMT, while physiological non-use, resulting from shoulder weakness, might respond better to anti-gravity muscles strengthening.",

This transition involves changes in gene expression and chromatin reorganization that result in the activation and silencing of stage-specific genes. However, the genomes of malaria parasites have been noted for their dearth of transcriptional and chromatin regulators and the molecular mediators of these changes remain largely unknown. We recently identified HomeoDomain Protein 1 (HDP1) as a DNA-binding protein that enhances the expression of key genes that are critical for early sexual differentiation. The discovery of a homeodomain-like DNA-binding protein marks a new class of transcriptional regulator in malaria parasites outside of the better-characterized ApiAP2 family. In this study, we show that HDP1 facilitates the necessary upregulation of inner membrane complex components during early gametocytogenesis that gives P. falciparum gametocytes they characteristic shape and is required for gametocyte maturation and parasite transmission.",

However, how RNAs are bound to paraspeckles is largely unknown. It is highly likely that binding of RNAs may occur via interactions with RBPs and accordingly, two structures present in the 3UTR of some RNAs have been shown to allow their association to paraspeckles via protein binding. However, Neat1 could also be involved in the targeting of RNAs through direct RNA-RNA interactions. Using a RNA pull-down procedure adapted to select only RNAs engaged in direct RNA-RNA interactions and followed by RNA-seq we showed that in a rat pituitary cell line, GH4C1 cells, 1791 RNAs were associated with paraspeckles by direct interaction with Neat1. Neat1 was actually found able to bind more than 30% of the total transcripts targeted by the paraspeckles, we have identified in this cell line in a previous study. Furthermore, given the biological processes in which direct RNAs targets of Neat1 were involved as determined by gene ontology analysis, it was proposed that Neat1 played a major role in paraspeckle functions such as circadian rhythms, mRNA processing, RNA splicing and regulation of cell cycle. Finally, we provided evidence that direct RNA targets of Neat1 were preferentially bound to the 5 end of Neat1 demonstrating that they are located in the shell region of paraspeckles.",

The majority of spontaneous activity occurred in regular Ca2+ transients clusters (CTCs) that propagated through the network. CTCs were organized and dependent upon Ca2+ entry through voltage-dependent Ca2+ conductances, L- and T-type Ca2+ channels. Removal of Ca2+ from the external solution abolished CTCs. Ca2+ release mechanisms reduced the duration and amplitude of Ca2+ transients but did not block CTCs. These data reveal how colonic pacemaker ICC-SM exhibit complex Ca2+ firing patterns and drive smooth muscle activity and overall colonic contractions.\n\nSynopsisHow Ca2+ signaling in colonic submucosal pacemaker cells couples to smooth muscle responses is unknown. This study shows how ICC modulate colonic motility via complex Ca2+ signaling and defines Ca2+ transients sources using optogenetic techniques.",

    "abstract": "Evidence is growing for a role of vitamin D in regulating skeletal muscle mass, strength and functional capacity. Given the role the kidneys play in activating total vitamin D, and the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), it is possible that deficiency contributes to the low levels of physical function and muscle mass in these patients. This is a secondary cross-sectional analysis of previously published interventional study, with ex vivo follow up work. 34 CKD patients at stages G3b-5 (eGFR 25.5 {+/-} 8.3ml/min/1.73m2; age 61 {+/-} 12 years) were recruited, with a sub-group (n=20) also donating a muscle biopsy. Vitamin D and associated metabolites were analysed in plasma by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectroscopy and correlated to a range of physiological tests of muscle size, function, exercise capacity and body composition. The effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 supplementation on myogenesis and myotube size was investigated in primary skeletal muscle cells from vitamin D deficient donors. In vivo, there was no association between total or active vitamin D and muscle size or strength, but a significant correlation with [Formula] was seen with the total form. Ex vivo, 1,25(OH)2D3 supplementation reduced IL-6 mRNA expression, but had no effect upon proliferation, differentiation or myotube diameter. This early preliminary work suggests that vitamin D deficiency is not a prominent factor driving the loss of muscle mass in CKD, but may play a role in reduced exercise capacity.",

However, empirical studies often fail to detect such costs. We addressed this conundrum using experimental evolution with Escherichia coli in several homogeneous and heterogeneous environments at multiple population sizes. We found that in heterogeneous environments, smaller populations paid significant costs, but larger ones avoided them altogether. Contrastingly, in homogeneous environments, larger populations paid more costs than the smaller ones. Overall, large population sizes and heterogeneous environments led to cost avoidance when present together but not on their own. Whole-genome whole-population sequencing revealed that the enrichment of multiple mutations within the same lineage (and not subdivision into multiple distinct specialist subpopulations) was the mechanism of cost avoidance. Since the conditions revealed by our study for avoiding costs are widespread, it explains why the costs expected in theory are rarely detected in experiments.",

    "abstract": "Aggression between juveniles can be unexpected, as their primary motivation is to survive until their reproductive stage. However, instances of aggression, which may escalate to cannibalism, can be vital for survival, although the factors (e.g. genetic or environmental) leading to cannibalism vary across taxa. While cannibalism can greatly accelerate individual growth, it may also reduce inclusive fitness when kin are consumed. As a solution to this problem, some cannibals demonstrate kin discrimination and preferentially attack unrelated individuals. Here, we used both experimental and modeling approaches to consider how physical traits (e.g. size in relation to opponent) and genetic relatedness mediate aggressive behavior in dyads of cannibalistic Dendrobates tinctorius tadpoles. We paired sibling, half-sibling, and non-sibling tadpoles of different sizes together in an arena and recorded their aggression and activity. We found that the interaction between size and relatedness predicts aggressive behavior: large non-siblings are significantly more aggressive than large siblings. Unexpectedly, although siblings tended to attack less overall, in size mismatched pairs they attacked faster than in non-sibling treatments. Ultimately, it appears that larval aggression reflects a balance between relatedness and size where individuals trade-off their own fitness with that of their relatives.",

One of the key steps in ncRNAs research is the ability to distinguish coding/non-coding sequences. We applied 7 machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, SVM, KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost, ANN and DL) through 15 model organisms from different evolutionary branches. Then, we created a stand-alone and web server tool (RNAmining) to distinguish coding and noncoding sequences, selecting the algorithm with the best performance (XGBoost). Firstly, we used coding/non-coding sequences downloaded from Ensembl (April 14th, 2020). Then, coding/non-coding sequences were balanced, had their tri-nucleotides counts analysed and we performed a normalization by the sequence length. Thus, in total we built 180 models. All the machine learning algorithms tests were performed using 10-folds cross-validation and we selected the algorithm with the best results (XGBoost) to implement at RNAmining. Best F1-scores ranged from 97.56% to 99.57% depending on the organism. Moreover, we produced a benchmarking with other tools already in literature (CPAT, CPC2, RNAcon and Transdecoder) and our results outperformed them, opening opportunities for the development of RNAmining, which is freely available at https://rnamining.integrativebioinformatics.me/.",

    "abstract": "Upstream of the 3-untranslated region in the SARS-CoV-2 genome is ORF10 which has been proposed to encode for the ORF10 protein. Current research is still unclear on whether this protein is synthesized, but further investigations are still warranted. Herein, this study uses multiple bioinformatic tools to biochemically and functionally characterize the ORF10 protein, along with predicting its tertiary structure. Results indicate a highly ordered, hydrophobic, and thermally stable protein that contains at least one transmembrane region. This protein also possesses high residue protein-binding propensity, primarily in the N-terminal half. An assessment of forty-one missense mutations reveal slight changes in residue flexibility, mainly in the C-terminal half. However, these same mutations do not inflict significant changes on protein stability and other biochemical features. The predicted model suggests the ORF10 protein contains a {beta}--{beta} motif with a {beta}-molecular recognition feature occurring in the first {beta}-strand. Functionally, the ORF10 protein could be a membrane protein. A single pocket was identified in this protein but found to possess low druggability. The ORF10 itself consists of two distinct lineages: the SARS-CoV lineage and the SARS-CoV-2 lineage. Evidence of strong positive selection (dN/dS = 4.01) and purifying selection (dN/dS = 0.713) were found within the SARS-CoV-2 lineage and SARS-CoV lineage, respectively. Collectively, these results continue to assess the biological relevance of ORF10 and its putatively encoded protein, thereby aiding in diagnostic and possibly vaccine development.",

We observe that the viral RNA adopts a pseudoknot structure lodged at the mRNA entry channel of the ribosome to generate tension in the mRNA that leads to frameshifting. The nascent viral polyprotein that is being synthesized by the ribosome paused at the frameshifting site forms distinct interactions with the ribosomal polypeptide exit tunnel. We use biochemical experiments to validate our structural observations and to reveal mechanistic and regulatory features that influence the frameshifting efficiency.

    "abstract": "Immune cells must integrate multiple extracellular signals to produce an appropriate inflammatory response, including production of a dynamic mix of eicosanoids and related bioactive lipids. Synthesis of these lipids is initiated on the membrane surface of the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum. One critical question is how the precursor arachidonic acid (AA) is distributed between the initial biosynthetic enzymes of the arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) and prostaglandin-endoperoxidase synthase-1/2 (COX-1/2) related pathways. To understand these balancing mechanisms, we hypothesized that fatty acid binding proteins mediate this process. We employed a multi-modal imaging approach by combining direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) with computational analyses and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to delineate the relationships of fatty acid binding proteins 3, 4, and 5 (FABP3-5) with 5-LO activating protein (FLAP), COX-1, and COX-2 in the presence of a stimulus (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) that triggers the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). LPS triggers a redistribution of FABP5 to higher order assemblies of COX-2 or FLAP. This was evidenced by a decrease in lifetime determined by FLIM. Colocalization between FABP3 and FLAP decreased, but no other changes in distribution were observed for FABP3 and FABP4. In contrast, assemblies of FABP5 with COX-1 were smaller and showed an increase in lifetime. The data indicate that FABP5 is a member of higher order assemblies of eicosanoid biosynthetic enzymes and that FABP5 may play a key role in regulating the organization of these structures. FABP5 is positioned to distribute AA to both the 5-LO and COX-2 pathways.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the novel coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, continues to cause significant public health burden and disruption globally. Genomic epidemiology approaches point to most countries in the world having experienced many independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 during the early stages of the pandemic. However, this situation may change with local lockdown policies and restrictions on travel leading to the emergence of more geographically structured viral populations and lineages transmitting locally. Here, we report the first SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Palestine sampled from early March, when the first cases were observed, through to August of 2020. SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Palestine fall across the diversity of the global phylogeny, consistent with at least nine independent introductions into the region. We identify one locally predominant lineage in circulation represented by 50 Palestinian SARS-CoV-2, grouping with isolated viral samples from patients in Israel and the UK. We estimate the age of introduction of this lineage to 05/02/2020 (16/01/2020 - 19/02/2020), suggesting SARS-CoV-2 was already in circulation in Palestine predating its first detection in Bethlehem in early March.

    "abstract": "Diatoms are unicellular photosynthetic algae known to secrete organic matter that fuels secondary production in the ocean, though our knowledge of how their physiology impacts the character of dissolved organic matter remains limited. Like all photosynthetic organisms, their use of light for energy and reducing power creates the challenge of avoiding cellular damage. To better understand the interplay between redox balance and organic matter secretion, we reconstructed a genome-scale metabolic model of Thalassiosira pseudonana strain CCMP 1335, a model for diatom molecular biology and physiology, with a 60-year history of studies. The model simulates the metabolic activities of 1,432 genes via a network of 2,792 metabolites produced through 6,079 reactions distributed across six subcellular compartments. Growth was simulated under different steady-state light conditions (5-200 mol photons m-2 s-1) and in a batch culture progressing from exponential growth to nitrate-limitation and nitrogen-starvation. We used the model to examine the dissipation of reductants generated through light-dependent processes and found that when available, nitrate assimilation is an important means of dissipating reductants in the plastid; under nitrate-limiting conditions, sulfate assimilation plays a similar role. The use of either nitrate or sulfate uptake to balance redox reactions leads to the secretion of distinct organic nitrogen and sulfur compounds. Such compounds can be accessed by bacteria in the surface ocean. The model of the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana provides a mechanistic explanation for the production of ecologically and climatologically relevant compounds that may serve as the basis for intricate, cross-kingdom microbial networks. Diatom metabolism has an important influence on global biogeochemistry; metabolic models of marine microorganisms link genes to ecosystems and may be key to integrating molecular data with models of ocean biogeochemistry.",

High-resolution 2D snapshots can be extracted.

    "abstract": "For colour vision, retinal circuits separate information about intensity and wavelength. This requires comparison of at least two spectrally distinct photoreceptors, as in the case of most mammals. However, many vertebrates use the full complement of four  ancestral cone-types ( red,  green,  blue,  UV), and in those cases the nature and implementation of this computation remains poorly understood. Here, we establish the complete circuit architecture of outer retinal circuits underlying colour processing in larval zebrafish, which involves the full ancestral complement of four cone- and three horizontal cell types. Our findings reveal that the synaptic outputs of red- and green-cones efficiently rotate the encoding of natural daylight in a principal component analysis (PCA)-like manner to yield primary achromatic and spectrally-opponent axes, respectively. Together, these two cones capture 91.3% of the spectral variance in natural light. Next, blue-cones are tuned so as to capture most remaining variance when opposed to green-cones. Finally, UV-cones present a UV-achromatic axis for prey capture. We note that fruit flies - the only other tetrachromat species where comparable circuit-level information is available - use essentially the same strategy to extract spectral information from their relatively blue-shifted terrestrial visual world. Together, our results suggest that rotating colour space into primary achromatic and chromatic axes at the eyes first synapse may be a fundamental principle of colour vision when using more than two spectrally well-separated photoreceptor types.",

    "abstract": "The pancreas has long been known to be densely innervated with parasympathetic, sympathetic, and visceral afferent fibers that are believed to exert significant influence on local endocrine activity and vascular function. Yet the extent to which these interactions depend on neurovascular dynamics in the normal and pathological states remain largely unknown. Herein we describe a new method for high resolution functional imaging of the rat pancreas in vivo. The method comprises a number of elements: a stability-optimized preparation in dorsal recumbency immobilizing several square centimeters of intact pancreas for upright fluorescent imaging while leaving access for concurrent manipulation of abdominal nerves, a full-frame two-photon imaging protocol and analysis pipeline supporting high-throughput (100+) monitoring of islet and acinar microvessel diameter dynamics simultaneously, and a first adaptation of random-access linescan imaging to the pancreas capable of tracking internal blood flow speeds up to 5 mm/s at 20 Hz across multiple microvessels. These methods were then deployed in concert to characterize the capacity of parasympathetic fibers to modulate pancreatic microvascular dynamics with compartment specificity. Electrical stimulation was repeatedly applied to the abdominal vagal trunks at various current magnitudes while imaging islet and acinar microvascular populations in the pancreas. Vagal stimulation consistently elicited increases in both islet and acinar capillary population motility in a current-dependent manner, with only acinar responsive vessels trending toward dilation. Further, we found vagal stimulation to profoundly and reversibly disrupt all traces of fast-wave vasomotor oscillation across a lobular arteriole-venule pair, and this was associated with a significant increase in average flow speed. Together, these findings add to mounting evidence that vagal projections exert tangible reversible influence on pancreatic microvascular activity and underscore the potential for new neuromodulation-based strategies to address diabetes, pancreatitis, or other diseases of the pancreas under autonomic nervous influence.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is causing a second outbreak so the hope for its complete eradication is far from happening. In the absence of effective vaccines, it is mandatory to find effective treatments with low adverse effects able to treat hospitalized patients with COVID-19 disease. In this work, we determined the existence of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells within the CD45RA- T memory cells from the blood of convalescent donors. Memory T cells can respond quickly to the infection and provide long-term immune protection to reduce the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms. Also, CD45RA- memory T cells confer protection from other pathogens the donors encountered in their life. This is vital to clear other secondary infections usually developed in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 specific memory T cells were found within all the CD45RA- subsets CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and in the central memory and effector memory subpopulations. The procedure to obtain the cells is feasible, easy to implement for small scale manufacture, quick and cost-effective involving minimal manipulation, and without GMP condition requirements. This biobank of specific SARS-CoV-2 memory T cells would be immediately available  off-the-shelf to treat moderate/severe cases of COVID-19 increasing the therapeutic options available for these patients.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies are promising therapeutics for COVID-19. However, little is known about the mechanisms of action of these antibodies or their effective dosing windows. We report the discovery and development of SC31, a potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing IgG1 antibody, originally isolated from a convalescent patient at day 27 after the onset of symptoms. Neutralization occurs via a binding epitope that maps within the ACE2 interface of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, conserved across all common circulating SARS-CoV-2 mutants. In SARS-CoV-2 infected K18-human ACE2 transgenic mice, SC31 demonstrated potent survival benefit by dramatically reducing viral load concomitant with attenuated pro-inflammatory responses linked to severe systemic disease, such as IL-6. Comparison with a Fc-null LALA variant of SC31 demonstrated that optimal therapeutic efficacy of SC31 requires intact Fc-mediated effector functions that can further induce an IFN{gamma}-driven anti-viral immune response. Dose-dependent efficacy for SC31 was observed down to 5mg/kg when dosed before the activation of lung inflammatory responses. Importantly, despite Fc{gamma}R binding, no evidence of antibody dependent enhancement was observed with the Fc-competent SC31 even at sub-therapeutic doses. Therapeutic efficacy was confirmed in SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters, where SC31 again significantly reduced viral load, decreased lung lesions and inhibited progression to severe disease manifestations. This study underlines the potential for significant COVID-19 patient benefit for the SC31 antibody that justifies rapid advancement to the clinic, as well as highlighting the importance of appropriate mechanistic and functional studies during development.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryAnti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG1 antibody SC31 controls infection in vivo by blocking SP:ACE2 binding and triggering a Fc-mediated anti-viral response.",

    "abstract": "There is ample phylogenetic evidence that many critical virus functions, like immune evasion, evolved by the acquisition of genes from their hosts through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). However, the lack of an experimental system has prevented a mechanistic understanding of this process. We developed a model to elucidate the mechanisms of HGT into vaccinia virus, the prototypic poxvirus. All identified gene capture events showed signatures of long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1)-mediated retrotransposition, including spliced-out introns, polyadenylated tails and target site duplications. In one case, the acquired gene integrated together with a polyadenylated host U2 small nuclear RNA. Integrations occurred across the genome, in some cases knocking out essential viral genes. These essential gene knockouts were rescued through a process of complementation by the parent virus followed by non-homologous recombination during serial passaging to generate a single competent virus. This work links multiple evolutionary mechanisms into one adaptive cascade and identifies host retrotransposons as major drivers for virus evolution.",

    "abstract": "Life in a three-dimensional structure such as a biofilm is typical for many bacteria, yet little is known about how strains with different genotypes interact in this context. Here, to systematically explore gene knockdowns across various three-dimensional contexts, we created arrayed libraries of essential-gene CRISPRi knockdowns in the model biofilm-forming bacterium Bacillus subtilis and measured competitive fitness during colony co-culture with a wild type-like parent on different media and at different knockdown levels. Partial knockdown led to a wide range of fitness phenotypes, with targeting of translation-related genes often leading to lower growth rates and rapid out-competition by the parent. Several knockdowns competed differentially in biofilms versus non-biofilm colonies, in some cases due to lack of a particular nutrient in one medium. Cells depleted for the alanine racemase AlrA died in monoculture, but co-cultures survived via nutrient sharing in a biofilm but not in liquid. This rescue was enhanced in biofilm co-culture with a parent unable to produce extracellular matrix, due to a mutualism involving nutrient and matrix sharing. Including alrA, we identified several examples of mutualism involving matrix sharing that occurred in a three-dimensional biofilm colony but not when growth was constrained to two dimensions. These findings demonstrate that growth in a three-dimensional biofilm can promote genetic diversity through sharing of secreted factors, and illustrate the role of matrix production in determining trajectories for biofilm evolution that may be relevant to pathogens and other environmental bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Ralstonia solancearum causes bacterial wilt disease on diverse plant hosts. R. solanacearum cells enter a host from soil or infested water through the roots, then multiply and spread in the water-transporting xylem vessels. Despite the low nutrient content of xylem sap, R. solanacearum grows very well inside the host, using denitrification to respire in this hypoxic environment. R. solanacearum growth in planta also depends on the successful deployment of protein effectors into host cells via a Type III Secretion System (T3SS). The T3SS is absolutely required for R. solanacearum virulence, but it is metabolically costly and can trigger host defenses. Thus, the pathogens success depends on optimized regulation of the T3SS. We found that a byproduct of denitrification, the toxic free-radical nitric oxide (NO), positively regulates the R. solanacearum T3SS both in vitro and in planta. Using chemical treatments and R. solanacearum mutants with altered NO levels, we show that the expression of a key T3SS regulator is induced by NO in culture. Analyzing the transcriptome of R. solanacearum responding to varying levels of NO both in culture and in planta revealed that the T3SS and effectors were broadly upregulated with increasing levels of NO. This regulation was specific to the T3SS and was not shared by other stressors. Our results suggest that R. solanacearum experiences an NO-rich environment in the plant host and may use this NO as a signal to activate T3SS during infection.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19, the clinical syndrome caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has rapidly spread globally causing tens of millions of infections and over a million deaths. The potential animal reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2 are currently unknown, however sequence analysis has provided plausible potential candidate species. SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enable its entry into host cells and establish infection. We analyzed the binding surface of ACE2 from several important animal species to begin to understand the parameters for the ACE2 recognition by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). We employed Shannon entropy analysis to determine the variability of ACE2 across its sequence and particularly in its RBD interacting region, and assessed differences between various species ACE2 and human ACE2. As cattle are a known reservoir for coronaviruses with previous human zoonotic transfer, and has a relatively divergent ACE2 sequence, we compared the binding kinetics of bovine and human ACE2 to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. This revealed a nanomolar binding affinity for bovine ACE2 but an approximate ten-fold reduction of binding compared to human ACE2. Since cows have been experimentally infected by SARS-CoV-2, this lower affinity sets a threshold for sequences with lower homology to human ACE2 to be able to serve as a productive viral receptor for SARS-CoV-2.",

To date, the regulation of sclerostin has been attributed exclusively to the transcriptional downregulation that occurs hours after stimulation. Here, we describe, for the first time, the rapid post-translational degradation of sclerostin protein by the lysosome following mechanical load or PTH. We present a unifying model, integrating both new and established mechanically- and hormonally-activated effectors into the regulated degradation of sclerostin by lysosomes. Using an in vivo mechanical loading model, we find transient inhibition of lysosomal degradation or the upstream mechano-signaling pathway controlling sclerostin abundance impairs subsequent load-induced bone formation. We also link dysfunctional lysosomes to aberrant sclerostin regulation using Gaucher disease iPSCs. These results inform a paradigm shift in how bone anabolic cues post-translationally regulate sclerostin and expands our understanding of how osteocytes regulate this fundamentally important protein to regulate bone formation.",

    "abstract": "Necroptosis is a lytic, inflammatory cell death pathway that is dysregulated in many human pathologies. The pathway is executed by a core machinery comprising the RIPK1 and RIPK3 kinases, which assemble into necrosomes in the cytoplasm, and the terminal effector pseudokinase, MLKL. RIPK3-mediated phosphorylation of MLKL induces oligomerization and translocation to the plasma membrane where MLKL accumulates as hotspots and perturbs the lipid bilayer to cause death. The precise choreography of events in the pathway, where they occur within cells, and pathway differences between species, are of immense interest. However, they have been poorly characterized due to a dearth of validated antibodies for microscopy studies. Here, we describe a toolbox of antibodies for immunofluorescent detection of the core necroptosis effectors, RIPK1, RIPK3 and MLKL, and their phosphorylated forms, in human and mouse cells. By comparing reactivity with endogenous proteins in wild-type cells and knockout controls in basal and necroptosis-inducing conditions, we characterise the specificity of frequently-used commercial and recently-developed antibodies for detection of necroptosis signaling events. Importantly, our findings demonstrate that not all frequently-used antibodies are suitable for monitoring necroptosis by immunofluorescence microscopy, and methanol-is preferable to paraformaldehyde-fixation for robust detection of specific RIPK1, RIPK3 and MLKL signals.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral cortical development is controlled by key transcription factors that specify the neuronal identities in the different cortical layers. These transcription factors are crucial for the identity of the different neurons, but the mechanisms controlling their expression in distinct cells are only partially known. Here we investigate the expression and stability of the mRNAs of Tbr1, Bcl11b, Fezf2, Satb2 and Cux1 in single developing mouse cortical cells. We focus on Satb2 and find that its mRNA expression occurs much earlier than its protein synthesis and in a set of cells broader than expected, suggesting an initially tight control of its translation, which is subsequently de-repressed at late developmental stages. Mechanistically, Satb2 3UTR modulates protein translation of GFP reporters during mouse corticogenesis. By in vitro pull-down of Satb2 3UTR-associated miRNAs, we select putative miRNAs responsible for SATB2 inhibition, focusing on those strongly expressed in early progenitor cells and reduced in late cells. miR-541, an Eutherian-specific miRNA, and miR-92a/b are the best candidates and their inactivation triggers robust and premature SATB2 translation in both mouse and human cortical cells. Our findings indicate that RNA interference plays a major role in the timing of cortical cell identity and may be part of the toolkit involved in specifying supra-granular projection neurons.",

    "abstract": "Regulatory protein access to the DNA duplex  interior depends on local DNA  breathing fluctuations, and the most fundamental of these are thermally-driven base stacking-unstacking interactions. The smallest DNA unit that can undergo such transitions is the dinucleotide, whose structural and dynamic properties are dominated by stacking, while the ion condensation, cooperative stacking and inter-base hydrogen-bonding, present in duplex DNA are not involved. We use dApdA to study stacking-unstacking at the dinucleotide level because the fluctuations observed are likely to resemble those of larger DNA molecules, but in the absence of constraints introduced by cooperativity are likely to be more pronounced, and thus more accessible to measurement. We study these fluctuations with a combination of Molecular Dynamics simulations on the microsecond timescale and Markov State Model analyses, and validate our results by calculations of circular dichroism (CD) spectra, with results that agree well with experiments. Our analyses show that the CD spectrum of dApdA is defined by two distinct chiral conformations that correspond, respectively, to a Watson-Crick form and a hybrid form with one base in a Hoogsteen configuration. We find also that ionic structure and water orientation around dApdA play important roles in controlling its breathing fluctuations.",

    "abstract": "Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) has had remarkable success in imaging cellular structures with nanometer resolution, but the need for activating only single isolated emitters limits imaging speed and labeling density. Here, we overcome this major limitation using deep learning. We developed DECODE, a computational tool that can localize single emitters at high density in 3D with highest accuracy for a large range of imaging modalities and conditions. In a public software benchmark competition, it outperformed all other fitters on 12 out of 12 data-sets when comparing both detection accuracy and localization error, often by a substantial margin. DECODE allowed us to take live-cell SMLM data with reduced light exposure in just 3 seconds and to image microtubules at ultra-high labeling density. Packaged for simple installation and use, DECODE will enable many labs to reduce imaging times and increase localization density in SMLM.",

    "abstract": "Biliary tract cancers (BTCs) are uncommon but highly lethal gastrointestinal malignancies. Gemcitabine/cisplatin is a standard-of-care (SOC) systemic therapy, but has a modest impact on survival and harbor toxicities including myelosuppression, nephropathy, neuropathy and ototoxicity. While BTCs are characterized by aberrations activating the cyclinD1-CDK4/6-CDKN2A-RB pathway, clinical use of CDK4/6 inhibitors as monotherapy is limited by lack of validated biomarkers, diffident pre-clinical efficacy and development of acquired drug resistance. Emerging studies have explored therapeutic strategies to enhance the anti-tumor efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibitors by combination with chemotherapy-regimens but their mechanism of action remains elusive. Here, we report in vitro and in vivo synergy in BTC models, showing enhanced efficacy, reduced toxicity and better survival with a combination comprising gemcitabine/cisplatin and CDK4/6 inhibitors. Furthermore, we demonstrated that abemaciclib monotherapy had only modest efficacy due to autophagy induced resistance. Notably, triplettherapy was able to potentiate efficacy through elimination of the autophagic flux. Correspondingly, abemaciclib potentiated RRM1 reduction, resulting in sensitization to gemcitabine. Conclusions: As such, these data provide robust pre-clinical mechanistic evidence of synergy between gemcitabine/cisplatin and CDK4/6 inhibitors, and delineate a path forward for translation of these findings to preliminary clinical studies in advanced BTC patients.",

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer (Pca) is a highly heterogeneous disease and the second more common tumor in males. Molecular and genetic profiles have been used to identify subtypes and guide therapeutic intervention. However, roughly 26% of primary Pca are driven by unknown molecular lesions. We use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and custom RNAseq-data normalization to identify a gene expression signature which segregates primary PRAD from normal tissues. This Core-Expression Signature (PRAD-CES) includes 33 genes and accounts for 39% of data complexity along the PC1-cancer axis. The PRAD-CES is populated by protein-coding (AMACR, TP63, HPN) and RNA-genes (PCA3, ARLN1), validated/predicted biomarkers (HOXC6, TDRD1, DLX1), and/or cancer drivers (PCA3, ARLN1, PCAT-14). Of note, the PRAD-CES also comprises six over-expressed LncRNAs without previous Pca association, four of them potentially modulating drivers genes TMPRSS2, PRUNE2 and AMACR. Overall, our PCA capture 57% of data complexity within PC1-3. GO enrichment and correlation analysis comprising major clinical features (i.e., Gleason Score, AR Score, TMPRSS2-ERG fusion and Tumor Cellularity) suggest that PC2 and PC3 gene signatures may describe more aggressive and inflammation-prone transitional forms of PRAD. Of note, surfaced genes may entail novel prognostic biomarkers and molecular alterations to intervene. Particularly, our work uncovered RNA genes with appealing implications on Pca biology and progression.",

    "abstract": "In castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), the loss of androgen receptor (AR)-dependence due to lineage plasticity, which has become more prevalent, leads to clinically highly aggressive tumors with few therapeutic options and is mechanistically poorly defined. To identify the master transcription factors (TFs) of CRPC in a subtype-specific manner, we derived and collected 29 metastatic human prostate cancer organoids and cell lines, and generated ATAC-seq, RNA-seq and DNA sequencing data. We identified four subtypes and their master TFs using novel computational algorithms: AR-dependent; Wnt-dependent, driven by TCF; neuroendocrine, driven by ASCL1 and NEUROD1 and stem cell-like (SCL), driven by the AP-1 family. The transcriptomic signatures of these four subtypes enabled the classification of 370 patients. We find that AP-1 co-operates with the inhibitable YAP/TAZ/TEAD pathway in the SCL subtype, the second most common group of CRPC tumors after AR-dependent. Together, this molecular classification reveals new drug targets and can potentially guide therapeutic decisions.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed and exacerbated gender biases in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine. Accumulating evidence suggests that female scientists productivity dropped during the initial lockdown period. With more time being spent on caregiving responsibilities, women may be struggling to collaborate on grant applications and launch new experiments. Scientists with disabilities or who belong to Indigenous nations or communities of color may have less time to devote to research due to health, family, or community needs. Collateral damage in this situation, the appropriate integration of sex, gender, and other identity characteristics in research content may also suffer. Sex and gender are better attended to when female scientists form part of the research team. Research funding agencies have a role to play in mitigating these effects by putting in place gender equity policies that support all applicants and ensure research quality. Accordingly, a national health research funder implemented gender policy changes that included extending deadlines and factoring sex and gender into COVID-19 grant requirements. Following these changes, the funder received more applications from female scientists, awarded a greater proportion of grants to female compared to male scientists, and received and funded more grant applications that considered sex and gender in the content of COVID-19 research. Whether or not these strategies will be sufficient in the long-term to prevent widening of the gender gap in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine requires continued monitoring and oversight. Further work is urgently required to mitigate inequities associated with identity characteristics beyond gender.",

    "abstract": "Proteins generated by localized mRNA translation in axons support nerve regeneration through retrograde injury signaling and localized axon growth mechanisms. RNA binding proteins (RBP) are needed for this and other aspects of post-transcriptional control of localized mRNAs, but only a limited number of axonal RBPs have been reported. We used a targeted mass spectrometry approach to profile the axonal RBPs in naive, injured and regenerating PNS axons. We detected 76 axonal proteins that are reported to have RNA binding activity, with the levels of several of these axonal RBPs changing with axonal injury and regeneration. These axonal RBPs with altered axoplasm levels include KHSRP that we previously reported decreases neurite outgrowth in developing CNS neurons. We show that KHSRP levels rapidly increase in sciatic nerve axons after crush injury and remain elevated increasing in levels out to 28 days post-sciatic nerve crush injury. Khsrp mRNA localizes into axons and the rapid increase in axonal KHSRP after axotomy is mediated by the local translation of its mRNA. KHSRP binds to mRNAs with a 3UTR AU-rich element and targets those mRNAs to the cytoplasmic exosome for degradation. KHSRP knockout mice show increased axonal levels of defined KHSRP target mRNAs, Gap43 and Snap25 mRNAs, following sciatic nerve injury and accelerated nerve regeneration in vivo. These data indicate that axonal translation of Khsrp mRNA following nerve injury serves to destabilize other axonal mRNAs and slow axon regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Seipin is a disk-like oligomeric ER protein important for lipid droplet (LD) biogenesis and triacylglycerol (TAG) delivery to growing LDs. Here we show through biomolecular simulations bridged to experiments that seipin can trap TAGs in the ER bilayer via the luminal hydrophobic helices of the protomers delineating the inner opening of the seipin disk. This promotes the nanoscale sequestration of TAGs at a concentration that by itself is insufficient to induce TAG clustering in a lipid membrane. We identify Ser166 in the 3 helix as a favored TAG occupancy site and show that mutating it compromises the ability of seipin complexes to sequester TAG in silico and to promote TAG transfer to LDs in cells. While seipin-S166D mutant colocalizes poorly with promethin, the association of nascent wild-type seipin complexes with promethin is promoted by TAGs. Together, these results suggest that seipin traps TAGs via its luminal hydrophobic helices, serving as a catalyst for seeding the TAG cluster from dissolved monomers inside the seipin ring, thereby generating a favorable promethin binding interface.",

    "abstract": "The misuse of opioids has reached epidemic proportions over the last decade, with over 2.1 million people in the U.S. suffering from substance use disorders related to prescription opioid pain relievers. This increase in opioid misuse affects all demographics of society, including women of child-bearing age, which has led to a rise in opioid use during pregnancy. Opioid use during pregnancy has been associated with increased risk of obstetric complications and adverse neonatal outcomes, including neonatal abstinence syndrome. Currently, opioid use disorder in pregnant women is treated with long-acting opioid agonists, including buprenorphine. Although buprenorphine reduces illicit opioid use during pregnancy and improves infant outcomes at birth, few long-term studies of the neurodevelopmental consequences have been conducted. The goal of the current experiments was to examine the effects of buprenorphine on the development of the cortex using fetal brain tissue, 3D brain cultures, and rodent models. First, we demonstrated that we can grow cortical and subpallial spheroids, which model the cellular diversity, connectivity, and activity of the developing human brain. Next, we show that cells in the developing human cortex express the nociceptin opioid (NOP) receptor and that buprenorphine can signal through this receptor in cortical spheroids. Using subpallial spheroids to grow inhibitory interneurons, we show that buprenorphine can alter interneuron development and migration into the cortex. Finally, using a rodent model of prenatal buprenorphine exposure, we demonstrate that alterations in interneuron distribution can persist into adulthood. Together, these results suggest that more research is needed into the long-lasting consequences of buprenorphine exposure on the developing human brain.",

We established a map of activating and repressive histone modifications for each cell type. ChromHMM state transition analysis and Pareto-based integration of differential levels of mRNA and epigenetic marks revealed that differentiation associated gene repression is initiated by the addition of H3K27me3 to promoters still carrying substantial levels of activating marks. Moreover, the integrative analysis identified genes specifically expressed in cells undergoing the transition into hypertrophy.\n\nInvestigation of enhancer profiles detected surprising differences in enhancer number, location, and transcription factor binding sites between the two closely related cell types. Furthermore, cell type-specific upregulation of gene expression was associated with a shift from low to high H3K27ac decoration. Pathway analysis identified PC-specific enhancers associated with chondrogenic genes, while HC-specific enhancers mainly control metabolic pathways linking epigenetic signature to biological functions.",

    "abstract": "The distribution of fitness effects for new mutations is one of the most theoretically important but difficult to estimate properties in population genetics. A crucial challenge to inferring the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) from natural genetic variation is the sensitivity of the site frequency spectrum to factors like population size change, population substructure, and non-random mating. Although inference methods aim to control for population size changes, the influence of non-random mating remains incompletely understood, despite being a common feature of many species. We report the distribution of fitness effects estimated from 326 genomes of Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode roundworm with a high rate of self-fertilization. We evaluate the robustness of DFE inferences using simulated data that mimics the genomic structure and reproductive life history of C. elegans. Our observations demonstrate how the combined influence of self-fertilization, genome structure, and natural selection can conspire to compromise estimates of the DFE from extant polymorphisms. These factors together tend to bias inferences towards weakly deleterious mutations, making it challenging to have full confidence in the inferred DFE of new mutations as deduced from standing genetic variation in species like C. elegans. Improved methods for inferring the distribution of fitness effects are needed to appropriately handle strong linked selection and selfing. These results highlight the importance of understanding the combined effects of processes that can bias our interpretations of evolution in natural populations.",

Pharmacological modulation significantly affects the proliferation speed of the cell fronts, and those modulators that promote cell mobility or division also lead to the most rapid evolution of cell front roughness. By comparing our experimental observations to numerical simulations of elastic cell fronts with purely short-range interactions, we demonstrate that the interactions at few-cell lengthscales play a key role. Our methodology provides a simple framework to measure and characterise the biological effects of such interactions, and could be useful in tumour phenotyping.\n\nProliferating cell fronts underpin wound healing, tumour invasion, and morphogenesis, and are governed by a complex and still not fully understood interplay of multiple mechanical and chemical factors. From a physics perspective, these cell fronts can be described as elastic interfaces in disordered media. Thus, analysing their geometric properties and dynamics can reveal the characteristic lengthscales of the dominant interactions, and point towards the underlying biological pathways. Here, we show that the roughness of proliferating fronts of Rat1 fibroblasts is governed by two different hierarchies of interactions, with distinct behaviour at sub-cell and few-cell lengthscales. Using in-vitro scratch assays, we find moreover that pharmacological modulators significantly affect the proliferation speed of the cell fronts as well as the evolution of their roughness, increased when cell-cell communication via gap junctions is perturbed, and decreased when cell division is repressed. We determine that our experimental observations cannot be reproduced by numerical simulations of elastic cell fronts with purely short-range interactions, demonstrating the key role of juxtacellular interactions at few-cell lengthscales. Our approach provides a simple framework to measure and characterise the biological effects of such interactions, and could be useful in tumour phenotyping.",

It is designed to leverage competition between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cells in order to suppress resistance and maintain tumor control for longer. Prompted by encouraging results from a recent pilot clinical trial, we evaluate the design of this initial test of adaptive therapy and identify three simple modifications that should improve performance. These modifications are designed to increase competition and are easy to implement. Using the mathematical model that supported the recent adaptive therapy trial, we show that the suggested modifications further delay time to tumor progression and also increase the range of patients who can benefit from adaptive therapy.",

    "abstract": "In many areas of science, the ability to use computers to process, analyze, and visualize large data sets has become essential. The mismatch between the ability to generate large data sets and the computing skill to analyze them is arguably the most striking within the life sciences. The Digital Image and Vision Applications in Science (DIVAS) project describes a scaffolded series of interventions implemented over the span of a year to build the coding and computing skill of undergraduate students majoring primarily in the natural sciences. The program is designed as a community of practice, providing support within a network of learners. The program focus, images as data, provides a compelling  hook for participating scholars. Scholars begin the program with a one-credit spring semester seminar where they are exposed to image analysis. The program continues in the summer with a one-week, intensive Python and image processing workshop. From there, scholars tackle image analysis problems using a pair programming approach and finish the summer with independent research. Finally, scholars participate in a follow-up seminar the following spring and help onramp the next cohort of incoming scholars. We observed promising growth in participant self-efficacy in computing that was maintained throughout the project as well as significant growth in key computational skills. DIVAS program funding was able to support seventeen DIVAS over three years, with 76% of DIVAS scholars identifying as women and 14% of scholars being members of an underrepresented minority group. Most scholars (82%) entered the program as freshmen, with 89% of DIVAS scholars retained for the duration of the program and 100% of scholars remaining a STEM major one year after completing the program. The outcomes of the DIVAS project support the efficacy of building computational skill through repeated exposure of scholars to relevant applications over an extended period within a community of practice.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of circadian behavior and physiology by the Drosophila brain clock requires communication from central clock neurons to downstream output regions, but the mechanism by which clock cells regulate downstream targets is not known. We show here that the pars intercerebralis (PI), previously identified as a target of the morning cells in the clock network, also receives input from evening cells. We determined that morning and evening clock neurons have time of day dependent connectivity to the PI, which is regulated by specific peptides as well as by fast neurotransmitters. Interestingly, PI cells that secrete the peptide DH44, and control rest:activity rhythms, are inhibited by clock inputs while insulin-producing cells are activated, indicating that the same clock cells can use different mechanisms to drive cycling in output neurons. Inputs of morning cells to the DILP2+ neurons are relevant for the circadian rhythm of feeding, reinforcing the role of the PI as a circadian relay that controls multiple behavioral outputs. Our findings provide mechanisms by which clock neurons signal to non-clock cells to drive rhythms of behavior.\n\nSignificance StatementDespite our growing understanding of how the fly clock network maintains free-running rhythms of behavior and physiology, little is known about how information is communicated from the clock network to the rest of the brain to regulate behavior. We identify glutamate and acetylcholine as key neurotransmitters signaling from clock neurons to the pars interecerebralis (PI), a clock output region regulating circadian rhythms of sleep and metabolism. We report a novel link between Drosophila evening clock neurons and the PI, and find that the effect of clock neurons on output neuron physiology varies, suggesting that the same clock cells use multiple mechanisms simultaneously to drive cycling in output neurons.",

Using Felsensteins 1981 DNA substitution model, we predict a linear restoring force on the mean of an additive phenotype. Remarkably, the mean dynamics are independent of the effect sizes and genotype and are similar to those predicted by the widely-used OU model for stabilizing selection and the house-of-cards model for phenotype evolution. We confirm the predictions empirically using additive molecular phenotypes calculated from ancestral reconstructions of putatively unconstrained DNA sequences in primate genomes. We predict and confirm empirically that the dynamics of the variance are more complicated than those predicted by the OU model, and show that our results for the restoring force of mutation hold even for nonadditive phenotypes, such as number of transcription factor binding sites, longest encoded peptide and folding propensity of the encoded peptide. Our results have implications for efforts to infer selection based on quantitative phenotype dynamics as well as to understand long-term trends in evolution of quantitative molecular traits.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThe present study examined if the expectation for learning enhances reconsolidation of conditioned fear memories using the post-retrieval extinction paradigm in an undergraduate sample (n = 48).\n\nMethodsThe study took place over three consecutive days. The expectation for learning was manipulated through oral instructions prior to memory reactivation. On day one, participants underwent differential fear conditioning to two spider images (CS+ and CS-). On day two, participants were assigned to either a reactivation with expectation for learning group, a reactivation with no expectation for learning group, or a no reactivation group. On day three, return of fear in response to the CS+ spider image was measured following reinstatement (i.e., four shocks). Fear potentiated startle (FPS) and skin conductance response (SCR) were taken as measures of fear.\n\nResultsThe study found evidence that the expectation for learning may enhanced reconsolidation with FPS as a measure of fear as it was only the expectation for learning group in which FPS to the CS+ remained stable following reinstatement, however this effect was small and non-robust. In contrast, no evidence of reconsolidation was observed for SCR, as all participants exhibited a return of fear following reinstatement.\n\nImplicationsThese findings suggest that a verbal manipulation of the expectation for learning may not be salient enough to induce reconsolidation as measured by SCR but may be sufficient as measured by FPS. Additionally, given in the inconsistent findings between SCR and FPS, the studys results bring into question whether the post-retrieval extinction paradigm is appropriate to investigate reconsolidation using both physiological measures concurrently.",

We observed decreased lysine methylation of the translation elongation factor eEF1A1. EEF1AKMT2 and EEF1AKMT3 are known to methylate eEF1A1, and we show here that their expression is dependent on SET-domain function of SETD2. Globally, we observe differential expression of hundreds of proteins in WT versus SETD2-KO cells, including increased expression of many involved in protein translation. Finally, we observe decreased progression free survival and loss of EEF1AKMT2 gene expression in SETD2-mutated tumors. Overall, these data suggest that SETD2-mutated ccRCC, via loss of enzymetic function of the SET domain, displays dysregulation of protein translation as a potentially important component of the transformed phenotype.",

BCP and Pre-C mutations increased HBV replication both in vitro and in vivo. HBV could persist in mice injected with wild type HBV infectious clone for about 7 weeks. However, HBV could persist about 5 weeks in mice injected with BCP HBV infectious clone, and 3 weeks only in mice injected with Pre-C HBV infectious clone. HBV related CD8+ CTL response in BCP HBV infectious clone injected mice only slightly increased, but significantly increased in Pre-C HBV infectious clone injected mice compared with that in wild type HBV infectious clone injected mice. The population of Tregs significantly increased in liver but not in spleen of mice injected with Pre-C HBV infectious clone. In summary, we demonstrate that HBeAg plays an important role in suppressing the CTL response, which is related with increasing the frequency of Tregs in mouse.

    "abstract": "The architectural protein Pita is critical for Drosophila embryogenesis and predominantly binds to gene promoters and insulators. In particular, Pita is involved in the organization of boundaries between regulatory domains that controlled the expression of three hox genes in the Bithorax complex (BX-C). The best-characterized partner for Pita is the BTB/POZ-domain containing protein CP190. Using in vitro pull-down analysis, we precisely mapped two unstructured regions of Pita that interact with the BTB domain of CP190. Then we constructed transgenic lines expressing the Pita protein of the wild-type and mutant variants lacking CP190-interacting regions. The expression of the mutant protein completely complemented the null pita mutation. ChIP-seq experiments with wild-type and mutant embryos showed that the deletion of the CP190-interacting regions did not significantly affect the binding of the mutant Pita protein to most chromatin sites. However, the mutant Pita protein does not support the ability of multimerized Pita sites to prevent cross-talk between the iab-6 and iab-7 regulatory domains that activate the expression of Abdominal-B (Abd-B), one of the genes in the BX-C. The recruitment of a chimeric protein consisting of the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 and CP190-interacting region of the Pita to the GAL4 binding sites on the polytene chromosomes of larvae induces the formation of a new interband, which is a consequence of the formation of open chromatin in this region. These results suggested that the interaction with CP190 is required for the primary Pita activities, but other architectural proteins may also recruit CP190 in flies expressing only the mutant Pita protein.\n\nAuthor SummaryPita is required for Drosophila development and binds specifically to a long motif in active promoters and insulators. Pita belongs to the Drosophila family of zinc-finger architectural proteins, which also includes Su(Hw) and the conserved among higher eukaryotes CTCF. The architectural proteins maintain the active state of regulatory elements and the long-distance interactions between them. The CP190 protein is recruited to chromatin through interaction with the architectural proteins. Here we mapped two regions in Pita that are required for interaction with the CP190 protein. We have demonstrated that CP190-interacting region of the Pita can maintain nucleosome-free open chromatin and is critical for Pita-mediated enhancer blocking activity. At the same time, interaction with CP190 is not required for the in vivo function of the mutant Pita protein, which binds to the same regions of the genome as the wild-type protein. Unexpectedly, we found that CP190 was still associated with the most of genome regions bound by the mutant Pita protein, which suggested that other architectural proteins were continuing to recruit CP190 to these regions. These results support a model in which the regulatory elements are composed of combinations of binding sites that interact with several architectural proteins with similar functions.",

    "abstract": "For sustainable function, each pancreatic islet {beta} cell maintains thousands of insulin granules (IGs) at all times. Glucose stimulation induces the secretion of a small portion of these IGs and simultaneously triggers IG biosynthesis to sustain this stock. The failure of these processes, often induced by sustained high-insulin output, results in type 2 diabetes. Intriguingly, newly synthesized IGs are more likely secreted during glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The older IGs tend to lose releasability and be degraded, which represents a futile metabolic load that can sensitize {beta} cells to workload-induced dysfunction and even death. Here, we examine the factor(s) that allows the preferential secretion of younger IGs. We show that {beta} cells without either microtubules (MTs) or Go signaling secrete a bigger portion of older IGs, which is associated with increased IG docking on plasma membrane. Yet Go inactivation does not alter the {beta}-cell MT network. These findings suggest that Go and MT regulate the preferential release of newer IGs via parallel pathways and provide two potential models to further explore the underlying mechanisms and physiological significance of this regulation in functional {beta} cells.",

However, it is not clear that earthworm abundances can be directly related to their edaphic environment, as noted in Darwins final publication, perhaps limiting or restricting their value as indicators of ecological quality in any given field.\n\nWe present results from a spatially explicit intensive survey of pastures within United Kingdom farms, looking for the main drivers of earthworm density at a range of scales. When describing spatial variability of earthworm abundance within any given field, the best predictor was earthworm abundance itself within 20 - 30 m of the sampling point; there were no consistent environmental correlates with earthworm numbers, suggesting that biological factors (e.g. colonisation rate, competition, predation, parasitism) drive or at least significantly modify earthworm distributions at this spatial level. However, at the national scale, earthworm abundance is well predicted by soil nitrate levels, density, temperature and moisture content, albeit not in a simple linear fashion. This suggests that although land can be managed at the farm scale to promote earthworm abundance and the resulting soil processes that deliver ecosystem services, within a field, earthworm distributions will remain patchy. The divergence in the interpretative value of earthworm abundance as an ecological indicator is a function of spatial scale, corresponding to species specific biological factors as well as a response to environmental pressures. Species abundance can effectively be used as ecological indicators, even if, at first, distributions seem random. However, care must be exercised, in the sampling design for the indicator species, if its abundance is to be used as a proxy for environmental quality at a particular scale (e.g. a management scale such as field scale).",

    "abstract": "Zoonotic disease risk is greatly influenced by cultural practices and belief systems. Yet, few studies have integrated traditional ecological knowledge and ontology with western ways of knowing to better understand potential zoonoses. Here, we integrate molecular phylogenetics, histopathology, and ethnography to characterize a filarial nematode found within the abdominal cavity of spider monkeys (Ateles paniscus). The filarid is recognized as  spider monkey cotton by indigenous Waiwai in the Konashen Community Owned Conservation Area, Guyana. Ethnographic data revealed that the Waiwai perceive of  spider monkey cotton as a normal characteristic within the  spider monkey person. Further, the Waiwai indicated that  cotton was ubiquitous with spider monkeys and is not understood to be infectious nor zoonotic. This distinction is in contrast to other internal parasites found within spider monkeys that the Waiwai know to cause disease in both monkeys and humans. Our morphological and molecular characterization support the classification of the filarid as Dipetalonema caudispina, a minimally studied and seemingly non-zoonotic parasite, consistent with Waiwai beliefs. Thus, our findings allow us to establish commensurability between scientific knowledge and indigenous ontology. More broadly, this work highlights the importance of integrating multiple knowledge systems and leveraging advanced genomics to better understand and prevent emerging zoonotic diseases.",

    "abstract": "DNA replication is a highly regulated process that occurs in the context of chromatin structure and is sensitive to several histone post-translational modifications. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the histone methylase Set1 is responsible for the transcription-dependent deposition of H3K4 methylation (H3K4me) throughout the genome. Here we show that a combination of a hypomorphic replication mutation (orc5-1) with the absence of Set1 (set1{Delta}) compromises the progression through S phase, and this is associated with a large increase in DNA damage. The ensuing DNA damage checkpoint activation, in addition to that of the spindle assembly checkpoint, restricts the growth of orc5-1 set1{Delta}. Interestingly, orc5-1 set1{Delta} is sensitive to the lack of RNase H activity while a reduction of histone levels is able to counterbalance the loss of Set1. We propose that the recently described Set1-dependent mitigation of transcription-replication conflicts becomes critical for growth when the replication forks accelerate due to decreased origin firing in the orc5-1 background. Furthermore, we show that an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, likely a consequence of the elevated DNA damage, is partly responsible for the lethality in orc5-1 set1{Delta}.\n\nAuthor summaryDNA replication, that ensures the duplication of the genetic material, starts at discrete sites, termed origins, before proceeding at replication forks whose progression is carefully controlled in order to avoid conflicts with the transcription of genes. In eukaryotes, DNA replication occurs in the context of chromatin, a structure in which DNA is wrapped around proteins, called histones, that are subjected to various chemical modifications. Among them, the methylation of the lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4) is carried out by Set1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, specifically at transcribed genes. We report that, when the replication fork accelerates in response to a reduction of active origins, the absence of Set1 leads to accumulation of DNA damage. Because H3K4 methylation was recently shown to slow down replication at transcribed genes, we propose that the Set1-dependent becomes crucial to limit the occurrence of conflicts between replication and transcription caused by replication fork acceleration. In agreement with this model, stabilization of transcription-dependent structures or reduction histone levels, to limit replication fork velocity, respectively exacerbates or moderates the effect of Set1 loss. Last, but not least, we show that the oxidative stress associated to DNA damage is partly responsible for cell lethality.",

    "abstract": "Potassium voltage-gated (Kv) channels need to detect and respond to rapidly changing ionic concentrations in their environment. With an essential role in regulating electric signaling, they would be expected to be optimal sensors that evolved to predict the ionic concentrations. To explore these assumptions, we use statistical mechanics in conjunction with information theory to model how animal Kv channels respond to changes in potassium concentrations in their environment. By estimating mutual information in representative Kv channel types across a variety of environments, we find two things. First, under a wide variety of environments, there is an optimal gating current that maximizes mutual information between the sensor and the environment. Second, as Kv channels evolved, they have moved towards decreasing mutual information with the environment. This either suggests that Kv channels do not need to act as sensors of their environment or that Kv channels have other functionalities that interfere with their role as sensors of their environment.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a global health concern. Strains from two internationally circulating sequence types, ST-7363 and ST-1901, have acquired resistance to treatment with third-generation cephalosporins mainly due to the emergence of mosaic penA alleles. These two STs were first detected in Japan; however, when and how the mosaic penA alleles emerged and spread to other countries remains unknown. Here, we addressed the evolution of penA alleles by obtaining complete genomes from three Japanese ST-1901 clinical isolates harboring mosaic penA allele 34 (penA-34) dating from 2005 and generating a phylogenetic representation of 1,075 strains sampled from 37 countries. We also sequenced the genomes of 103 Japanese ST-7363 N. gonorrhoeae isolates from 1996-2005 and reconstructed a phylogeny including 88 previously sequenced genomes. Based on an estimate of the time of emergence of ST-1901 harboring mosaic penA-34 and ST-7363 harboring mosaic penA-10, and >300 additional genome sequences of Japanese strains representing multiple STs isolated in 1996-2015, we suggest that penA-34 in ST-1901 was generated from penA-10 via recombination with another Neisseria species, followed by a second recombination event with a gonococcal strain harboring wildtype penA-1. Following the acquisition of penA-10 in ST-7363, a dominant sub-lineage rapidly acquired fluoroquinolone resistance mutations at GyrA 95 and ParC 87-88, possibly due to independent mutations rather than horizontal gene transfer. Literature data suggest the emergence of these resistance determinants may reflect selection from the standard treatment regimens in Japan at that time. Our findings highlight how recombination and antibiotic use across and within Neisseria species intersect in driving the emergence and spread of drug-resistant gonorrhea.\n\nAuthor summaryAntimicrobial resistance is recognized as one of the greatest threats to human health, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae resistance is classified as one of the most urgent. The two major internationally spreading lineages resistant. to first line drugs likely originated in Japan, but when and how their genetic resistance determinants emerged remain unknown. In this study, we conducted an evolutionary analysis using clinical N. gonorrhoeae isolates from 37 countries, including a historical collection of Japanese isolates, to investigate the emergence of resistance in each of the two major lineages. We showed that the penA allele responsible for resistance to cephalosporins, the first-line treatment for gonorrhea, was possibly generated by two recombination events, one from another Neisseria species and one from another N. gonorrhoeae lineage. We also showed that mutations responsible for resistance to a previously widely used antibiotic treatment occurred twice independently in one of the two major lineages. The emergence of the genetic resistance determinants potentially reflects selection from the standard treatment regimen at that time. Our findings highlight how recombination (horizontal gene transfer) and antibiotic use across and within a bacterial species intersect in driving the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance genes and mutations.",
