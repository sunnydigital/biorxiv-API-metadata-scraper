    "abstract": "Intracellular density impacts the physical nature of the cytoplasm and can globally affect cellular processes, yet density regulation remains poorly understood. Here, using a new quantitative phase imaging method, we determined that dry-mass density varies during the cell cycle in fission yeast. Density decreased during G2, increased in mitosis and cytokinesis, and rapidly dropped at cell birth. These density variations were explained by a constant rate of biomass synthesis, coupled to slowdown of volume growth during cell division and rapid expansion post-cytokinesis. Arrest at specific cell-cycle stages led to continued increases or decreases in density. Spatially heterogeneous patterns of density suggested links between density regulation and tip growth, and septum bending away from higher-density daughters linked density to intracellular osmotic pressure. Our results demonstrate that systematic density variations during the cell cycle are predominantly due to modulation of volume expansion, and reveal functional consequences of density gradients and cell-cycle arrests.",

A simple experiment produced a surprising result that shapes our approach. Changing the size of a target for smooth pursuit eye movements changes the relationship between the variance and mean of the evoked behavior in a way that contradicts the regime of \"signal-dependent noise\" and defies traditional decoding approaches. A theoretical analysis leads us to conclude that sensory decoding circuits for pursuit include multiple parallel pathways and multiple sources of variation. Behavioral and neural responses with biomimetic statistics emerge from a biologically-motivated circuit model with noise in the pathway that is dedicated to flexibly adjusting the strength of visual-motor transmission. Flexible adjustment of transmission strength applies much more broadly to issues in sensory-motor control such as Bayesian integration and control strategies to optimize motor behavior.",

    "abstract": "Reward value is known to modulate learning speed in spatial memory tasks, but little is known about its influence on the dynamical changes in hippocampal spatial representations. Here, we monitored the trial-to-trial changes in hippocampal place cell activity during the acquisition of place-reward associations with varying reward size. We show a faster reorganization and stabilization of the hippocampal place map when a goal location is associated with a large reward. The reorganization is driven by both rate changes and the appearance and disappearance of place fields. The occurrence of hippocampal replay activity largely followed the dynamics of changes in spatial representations. Replay patterns became more selectively tuned towards behaviorally relevant experiences over the course of learning. These results suggests that high reward value enhances memory retention via accelerating the formation and stabilization of the hippocampal cognitive map and enhancing its reactivation during learning.",

    "abstract": "Brain and spinal cord oligodendroglia have distinct functional characteristics, and cell autonomous loss of individual genes can result in different regional phenotypes. However, sequencing studies to date have not revealed distinctions between brain and spinal cord oligodendroglia. Using single-cell analysis of oligodendroglia during myelination, we demonstrate that brain and spinal cord precursors are transcriptionally distinct, defined predominantly by cholesterol biosynthesis. We further identify mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) as a major regulator promoting cholesterol biosynthesis in oligodendroglia. Oligodendroglial-specific loss of mTOR compromises cholesterol biosynthesis in both the brain and spinal cord. Importantly, mTOR loss has a greater impact on cholesterol biosynthesis in spinal cord oligodendroglia that corresponds with more pronounced developmental deficits. However, loss of mTOR in brain oligodendroglia ultimately results in oligodendrocyte death, spontaneous demyelination, and impaired axonal function, demonstrating that mTOR is required for myelin maintenance in the adult brain.",

    "abstract": "In addition to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) role in motor control, STN deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinsons disease (PD) has also uncovered its involvement in cognitive and limbic processing. STN neural oscillations analyzed through local field potential (LFP) recordings have been shown to contribute to emotional (mostly in the alpha band [8-12 Hz]) and cognitive processing (theta [4-7 Hz] and beta [13-30 Hz] bands). In this study, we aimed at testing the hypothesis that STN oscillatory activity is involved in explicit and implicit processing of emotions. To achieve this objective, we used a task that presented patients with fearful emotional facial expressions and asked them to identify the emotion (explicit task) or gender associated with the face (implicit task). We evaluated emotion and task effects on STN neural oscillations power and intertrial phase consistency. Our results revealed that accuracy was lower in the implicit task. Increased STN delta power and decreased alpha and beta power were observed after stimulus presentation. However, there was no influence of emotional facial expression, i.e. neutral versus fear, nor task demands. Intertrial phase consistency in the delta and theta band increased after stimulus onset, in the same time-period as delta power increased. However, similarly to oscillatory power, no changes related to emotional fear expression or task demand were found.\n\nThese findings suggest that STN oscillatory activity is not specifically involved in explicit and/or implicit processing of emotions, and that power and phase synchronization changes might be more related to overall task-execution mechanisms. These conjectures remain to be confirmed.\n\nHighlights- STN LFPs were recorded during an emotional/gender recognition task in PD patients.\n- STN delta power increased, and alpha and beta power decreased after stimulus onset.\n- Power changes were not influenced by emotional fearful expression or task demands.\n- Delta/theta intertrial phase consistency increased after stimulus onset.\n- Intertrial phase consistency was not affected by emotional valence or task demands.\n- The observed STN activity was likely related to general task-execution mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Real-time fMRI neurofeedback is an increasingly popular neuroimaging technique that allows an individual to gain control over his/her own brain signals, which can lead to improvements in behavior in healthy participants as well as to improvements of clinical symptoms in patient populations. However, a considerably large ratio of participants undergoing neurofeedback training do not learn to control their own brain signals and, consequently, do not benefit from neurofeedback interventions, which limits clinical efficacy of neurofeedback interventions. As neurofeedback success varies between studies and participants, it is important to identify factors that might influence neurofeedback success. Here, for the first time, we employed a big data machine learning approach to investigate the influence of 20 different design-specific (e.g. activity vs. connectivity feedback), region of interest-specific (e.g. cortical vs. subcortical) and subject-specific factors (e.g. age) on neurofeedback performance and improvement in 608 participants from 28 independent experiments.\n\nWith a classification accuracy of 60% (considerably different from chance level), we identified two factors that significantly influenced neurofeedback performance: Both the inclusion of a pre-training no-feedback run before neurofeedback training and neurofeedback training of patients as compared to healthy participants were associated with better neurofeedback performance. The positive effect of pre-training no-feedback runs on neurofeedback performance might be due to the familiarization of participants with the neurofeedback setup and the mental imagery task before neurofeedback training runs. Better performance of patients as compared to healthy participants might be driven by higher motivation of patients, higher ranges for the regulation of dysfunctional brain signals, or a more extensive piloting of clinical experimental paradigms. Due to the large heterogeneity of our dataset, these findings likely generalize across neurofeedback studies, thus providing guidance for designing more efficient neurofeedback studies specifically for improving clinical neurofeedback-based interventions. To facilitate the development of data-driven recommendations for specific design details and subpopulations the field would benefit from stronger engagement in Open Science and data sharing.",

    "abstract": "Though SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the respiratory system, it is increasingly appreciated that patients may suffer neurological symptoms of varied severity1-3. However, an unbiased understanding of the molecular processes across brain cell types that could contribute to these symptoms in COVID-19 patients is still missing. Here, we profile 47,678 droplet-based single-nucleus transcriptomes from the frontal cortex and choroid plexus across 10 non-viral, 4 COVID-19, and 1 influenza patient. We complement transcriptomic data with immunohistochemical staining for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. We find that all major cortex parenchymal and choroid plexus cell types are affected transcriptionally with COVID-19. This arises, in part, from SARS-CoV-2 infection of the cortical brain vasculature, meninges, and choroid plexus, stimulating increased inflammatory signaling into the brain. In parallel, peripheral immune cells infiltrate the brain, microglia activate programs mediating the phagocytosis of live neurons, and astrocytes dysregulate genes involved in neurotransmitter homeostasis. Among neurons, layer 2/3 excitatory neurons--evolutionarily expanded in humans4--show a specific downregulation of genes encoding major SNARE and synaptic vesicle components, predicting compromised synaptic transmission. These perturbations are not observed in terminal influenza. Many COVID-19 gene expression changes are shared with those in chronic brain disorders and reside in genetic variants associated with cognitive function, schizophrenia, and depression. Our findings and public dataset provide a molecular framework and new opportunities to understand COVID-19 related neurological disease.",

Despite its cohesive structure, delineating the intranetwork organization and functional diversity of the PMN is crucial for understanding its contributions to multidimensional event cognition. Here, we probed functional connectivity of the PMN during movie watching to identify its pattern of connections and subnetwork functions in a split-sample replication of 136 participants. Consistent with prior findings of default network fractionation, we identified distinct PMN subsystems: a Ventral PM subsystem (retrosplenial cortex, parahippocampal cortex, posterior angular gyrus) and a Dorsal PM subsystem (medial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, anterior angular gyrus). Ventral and Dorsal PM subsystems were differentiated by functional connectivity with parahippocampal cortex and precuneus and integrated by retrosplenial cortex and posterior cingulate cortex, respectively. Finally, the distinction between PMN subsystems is functionally relevant: whereas both Dorsal and Ventral PM connectivity tracked the movie content, only Ventral PM connections increased in strength at event transitions and appeared sensitive to episodic memory. Overall, these findings reveal PMN functional pathways and the distinct functional roles of intranetwork subsystems during event cognition.",

Here, we extend those findings to define cis- and trans-acting factors that regulate BFL-1 in LCLs and reliance on BFL-1 for survival from extrinsic apoptosis. Beyond LCLs, BFL-1 is expressed in B cells maturing in the germinal center (GC). We therefore characterized the gene expression profiles and chromatin landscape of maturing human tonsillar B-cell subsets. While chromatin accessibility at the BFL-1 locus increases as naive B cells enter the GC reaction, BFL-1 expression increases during the transition from dark zone to light zone (LZ) correlating with association between enhancer regions and the transcriptional start site. The relationship between LCLs and LZ B cells suggests that EBV phenocopies GC biology to enhance their survival in establishing latent infection.",

    "abstract": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by devastating and progressive lung parenchymal fibrosis, resulting in poor patient prognosis. An aberrant recapitulation of developmental lung gene expression, including genes for transforming growth factor (TGF)-{beta} and WNT, has been widely implicated in the pathogenic IPF wound healing process that results from repetitive alveolar epithelial injury. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been shown to carry bioactive molecules and to be involved in various physiological and pathological processes. Here, we demonstrate that, by attenuating WNT signaling, human bronchial epithelial cell-derived EVs (HBEC EVs) inhibit TGF-{beta} mediated induction of both myofibroblast differentiation and lung epithelial cellular senescence. This effect of HBEC EVs is more pronounced than that observed with mesenchymal stem cell-derived EVs. Mechanistically, the HBEC EV microRNA (miRNA) cargo is primarily responsible for attenuating both myofibroblast differentiation and cellular senescence. This attenuation occurs via inhibition of canonical and non-canonical WNT signaling pathways. Among enriched miRNA species present in HBEC EVs, miR-16, miR-26a, miR-26b, miR-141, miR-148a, and miR-200a are mechanistically involved in reducing WNT5A and WNT10B expression in LFs, and in reducing WNT3A, WNT5A, and WNT10B expression in HBECs. Mouse models utilizing intratracheal administration of EVs demonstrate efficient attenuation of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis development accompanied by reduced expression of both {beta}-catenin and markers of cellular senescence. These findings indicate that EVs derived from normal resident lung HBECs may possess anti-fibrotic properties. They further suggest that, via miRNA-mediated inhibition of TGF-{beta}-WNT crosstalk, HBEC EVs administration can be a promising anti-fibrotic modality of treatment for IPF.",

The four core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) are conserved across sequenced eukaryotic genomes and therefore thought to be universal to eukaryotes. In the early 1980s, however, a series of biochemical investigations failed to find evidence for histones or nucleosomal structures in the microscopic green alga Nanochlorum eucaryotum. If true, derived histone loss in this lineage would constitute an exceptional case that might help us further understand the principles governing eukaryotic gene regulation. To substantiate these earlier reports of histone loss in N. eucaryotum, we sequenced, assembled and quantified its transcriptome. Following a systematic search for histone-fold domains in the assembled transcriptome, we detect orthologs to all four core histones. We also find histone mRNAs to be highly expressed, comparable to the situation in other eukaryotes. Finally, we obtain characteristic protection patterns when N. eucaryotum chromatin is subjected to micrococcal nuclease digestion, indicating widespread formation of nucleosomal complexes in vivo. We conclude that previous reports of missing histones in N. eucaryotum were mistaken. By all indications, N. eucaryotum has histone-based chromatin characteristic of most eukaryotes.",

Thus, identifying the function-related sites specific to each subunit is essential for understanding the characteristics of the subunits and the receptors assembled by them. In this study, we examined the sequence features of the nine neuronal nAChRs subunits from twelve representative vertebrate species. Analysis revealed that all the subunits were subject to strong purifying selection in evolution, and each was under a unique pattern of selection pressures. At the same time, the functional constraints were not uniform within each subunit, with different domains in the molecule being subject to different selection pressures. Via evolutionary analyses, we also detected potential positive selection events in the subunits or subunit clusters, and identified the sites might be associated with the function specificity of each subunit. Furthermore, positive selection at some domains might contributed to the diversity of subunit function; for example, the {beta}9 strand might be related to the agonist specificity of  subunit in heteromeric receptor and {beta}4-{beta}5 linker could be involved in Ca2+ permeability. Subunits 7, 4 and {beta}2 subunits possess a strong adaptability in vertebrates. Our results highlighted the importance of tracking functional differentiation in protein sequence underlying functional properties of nAChRs. In summary, our work may provide clues on understanding the diversity and the function specificity of the nAChR subunits, as well as the receptors co-assembled by them.",

    "abstract": "Ants exhibit a striking variety of lifestyles, including highly specialist or mutualist species. The minute blind workers of the African genus Melissotarsus chew tunnels in live trees to accommodate their obligate partner scale insects. Their modified legs are adapted for tunneling, but are unsuited for walking outside, confining these ants to their initial host tree. Here, we investigated whether this unique lifestyle results in complex patterns of genetic diversity at different scales, from the same tree to different populations. Using 19 microsatellite markers, we assessed their mating strategy and colony structure among and across populations in South Africa. We showed that only one queen reproduces within a colony, mated with up to three males. Yet, several inseminated dealate queens are present in colonies; one probably replaces the older queen as colonies age. The reproduction of a single queen per colony at a given time results in genetic differentiation between colonies, even those located on the same tree. Overall, we discussed how the slow process of colony digging under the bark and the lack of worker patrolling above the bark might result in reduced competition between colonies and allow several secluded colonies to cohabit in a cramped space on a tree.",

    "abstract": "Commercial hybrid breeding operations can be described as decentralized networks of smaller, more or less isolated breeding programs. There is further a tendency for the disproportionate use of successful inbred lines for generating the next generation of recombinants, which has led to a series of significant bottlenecks, particularly in the history of the North American and European maize germplasm. Both the decentralization and the disproportionate inbred use reduce effective population size and constrain the accessible genetic space. Under these conditions, long term response to selection is not expected to be optimal under the classical infinitesimal model of quantitative genetics. In this study we therefore aim to propose an alternative rational for the success of large breeding operations in the context of genetic complexity arising from the structure and properties of interactive genetic networks. For this we use simulations based on the NK model of genetic architecture. We indeed found that constraining genetic space and reducing effective population size, through program decentralization and disproportionate inbred use, is required to expose additive genetic variation and thus facilitate heritable genetic gains. These results introduce new insights into why the historically grown structure of hybrid breeding programs was successful in improving the yield potential of hybrid crops over the last century. We also hope that a renewed appreciation for \"why things worked\" in the past can guide the adoption of novel technologies and the design of future breeding strategies for navigating biological complexity.",

To understand the mechanisms regulating the extremely intricate biogenesis of this fundamental bioenergetic machine, we analyzed the structural and functional consequences of the ablation of NDUFS3, a non-catalytic core subunit. We prove that in diverse mammalian cell types a small amount of functional CI can still be detected in the complete absence of NDUFS3. In addition, we have determined the dynamics of CI disassembly when the amount of NDUFS3 is gradually decreased. The process of degradation of the complex occurs in a hierarchical and modular fashion where the ND4-module remains stable and bound to TMEM126A. We have thus, uncovered the function of TMEM126A, the product of a disease gene causing recessive optic atrophy, as a factor necessary for the correct assembly and function of CI.",

Here we present a Fast hydrogeL prOjection stereolithogrAphy Technology (FLOAT) that allows the creation of a centimeter-sized, multiscale solid hydrogel model within minutes. Through precisely controlling the photopolymerization condition, we established low suction force-driven, high-velocity flow of the hydrogel prepolymer that supports the continuous replenishment of the prepolymer solution below the curing part and the nonstop part growth. We showed that this process is unique to the hydrogel prepolymer without externally supplemented oxygen. The rapid printing of centimeter-sized hydrogel models using FLOAT was shown to significantly reduce the part deformation and cellular injury caused by the prolonged exposure to the environmental stresses in layer-by-layer based printing methods. Media perfusion in the printed vessel network was shown to promote cell survival and metabolic function in the deep core of the large-sized hydrogel model over long term. The FLOAT is compatible with multiple photocurable hydrogel materials and the printed scaffold supports the endothelialization of prefabricated vascular channels. Together, these studies demonstrate a rapid 3D hydrogel printing method and highlight the potential of this method in the fabrication of large-sized engineered tissue models.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe construction of the compacted de Bruijn graph from collections of reference genomes is a task of increasing interest in genomic analyses. These graphs are increasingly used as sequence indices for short and long read alignment. Also, as we sequence and assemble a greater diversity of genomes, the colored compacted de Bruijn graph is being used as the basis for efficient methods to perform comparative genomic analyses on these genomes. Therefore, designing time and memory efficient algorithms for the construction of this graph from reference sequences is an important problem.\n\nResultsWe introduce a new algorithm, implemented in the toolCuttlefish, to construct the (colored) compacted de Bruijn graph from a collection of one or more genome references. Cuttlefish introduces a novel approach of modeling de Bruijn graph vertices as finite-state automata; it constrains these automatas state-space to enable tracking their transitioning states with very low memory usage. Cuttlefish is fast and highly parallelizable. Experimental results demonstrate that it scales much better than existing approaches, especially as the number and the scale of the input references grow. On our test hardware, Cuttlefish constructed the graph for 100 human genomes in under 9 hours, using ~29 GB of memory while no other tested tool completed this task. On 11 diverse conifer genomes, the compacted graph was constructed by Cuttlefish in under 9 hours, using ~84 GB of memory, while the only other tested tool that completed this construction on our hardware took over 16 hours and ~289 GB of memory.\n\nAvailabilityCuttlefish is written in C++14, and is available under an open source license at https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/cuttlefish.\n\nContactrob@cs.umd.edu\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary text are available at Bioinformatics online.",

Despite the significant biological and biomedical relevance of these proteins, a detailed mechanistic picture for chemo-mechanical couplings involved in substrate/proton transport and protein structural changes is missing. We therefore performed microsecond-level molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of bacterial POT transporter PepTSt, which shares ~80% sequence identity with the human POT, PepT1, in the substrate binding region. Three different conformational states of PepTSt were simulated including, (i) occluded, apo, (ii) inward-facing, apo, and (iii) inward-facingoccluded, Leu-Ala bound. We propose that the interaction of R33 with E299 and E300 acts as a conformational switch (i.e., to trigger the conformational change from an inward-to outward-facing state) in the substrate transport. Additionally, E299 and E400 should disengage from interacting with the substrate either through protonation or through co-ordination with a cation for the substrate to get transported.",

    "abstract": "One of the central functions of the endothelium is to maintain a vascular barrier that prevents fluid leakiness and immune cell influx from the circulating blood into the tissue. The barrier integrity of the endothelium is largely controlled by adherens junctions (AJs) and the key AJ molecule VE-cadherin, which maintains cell cohesion via homotypic trans-interaction with VE-cadherin molecules on neighboring endothelial cells. Tension is required to maintain junction homeostasis, but little is known about the role of endothelial metabolism and bioenergetics in regulating junctional forces. Because glycolysis is the main source of ATP generation in endothelial cells, we examined the bioenergetic control of the mechanics of VE-cadherin junctions, by focusing on the glycolysis regulatory enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3). Results from traction force imbalance measurements and a VE-cadherin tension sensor revealed that inhibiting PFKFB3 significantly reduced the average junctional tension and the force on VE-cadherin complexes. The decrease in tension was largely due to mechanical changes distal from the cell-cell contacts. Specifically, inhibiting glycolysis perturbs focal adhesions and disrupts actin organization, directly impacting the net force on intercellular contacts. These findings identify a critical role of cellular metabolism for the mechanics and integrity of vascular endothelial junctions, by maintaining global cell mechanics.\n\nStatement of SignificanceThis study examines how forces at intercellular junctions are bioenergetically regulated. Results reveal altered mechanical force generation and transmission due to the breakdown of stress-transmitting fibers during lung injury. These junctions control the barrier function of the vascular endothelium, which requires tight inter cellular adhesions to prevent fluid and macromolecules from passing through the endothelial barrier. We determined how the availability of ATP affects the tension between human endothelial cells, by regulating forces produced remotely from the junctions. These global changes alter both the force at the junctions themselves, and the force transmitted across the entire cell through actin fibers.",

    "abstract": "In the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, NG2+/Nestin+ mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) promote hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quiescence1,2. Importantly, the BM can also harbour disseminated tumour cells (DTCs) from multiple cancers, which, like HSCs, can remain dormant3. The BM signals are so growth-restrictive that dormant BM DTCs can persist for years to decades only to awaken and fuel lethal metastasis3-10. The mechanisms and niche components regulating DTC dormancy remain largely unknown. Here, we reveal that periarteriolar BM-resident NG2+/Nestin+ MSCs can instruct breast cancer (BC) DTCs to enter dormancy. NG2+/Nestin+ MSCs produce TGF{beta}2 and BMP7 and activate a quiescence pathway dependent on TGFBRIII and BMPRII, which via p38-kinase result in p27-CDK inhibitor induction. Importantly, genetic depletion of the NG2+/Nestin+ MSCs or conditional knock-out of TGF{beta}2 in the NG2+/Nestin+ MSCs led to awakening and bone metastatic expansion of otherwise dormant p27+/Ki67- DTCs. Our results provide a direct proof that HSC dormancy niches control BC DTC dormancy. Given that aged NG2+/Nestin+ MSCs can lose homeostatic control of HSC dormancy, our results suggest that aging or extrinsic factors that affect the NG2+/Nestin+ MSC niche may result in a break from dormancy and BC bone relapse.",

Mechanistically, this interaction is driven by the LPA/PKD-1 signaling pathway, which promotes arteriolar differentiation and self-renewal.

We propose that collagens promote immune evasion by interacting with LAIR-1 and that LAIR-2 could release LAIR-1 mediated immune suppression. Analysis of public datasets shows high LAIR-2 expression being associated with a favorable outcome in certain tumors. We designed a dimeric LAIR-2 with a functional IgG1 Fc tail, NC410, and showed that NC410 reduces tumor growth and increases T cell expansion and effector function in humanized tumor models. Immunohistochemical analysis of human tumors shows that NC410 binds to collagen-rich areas where LAIR-1+ immune cells are localized.

The protease cathepsin D (cath-D), a marker of poor prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), is aberrantly secreted in the tumor microenvironment. Using degradomic analyses by TAILS, we discovered that the matricellular protein SPARC is a substrate of extracellular cath-D. In vitro, cath-D induced limited proteolysis of SPARC C-terminal extracellular Ca2+ binding domain at acidic pH, leading to the production of SPARC fragments (34-, 27-, 16-, 9-, and 6-kDa). Similarly, cath-D secreted by TNBC cells cleaved fibroblast- and cancer cell-derived SPARC at the tumor pericellular acidic pH. SPARC cleavage also occurred in TNBC tumors. Among these fragments, only the 9-kDa SPARC fragment inhibited TNBC cell adhesion and spreading on fibronectin, and stimulated their migration, endothelial transmigration, and invasion.

    "abstract": "Increasing drought stress poses a severe threat to agricultural productivity. Plants, however, evolved numerous mechanisms to cope with such environmental stress. Here we report that the stress-induced production of a peptide signal contributes to stress tolerance. The expression of phytosulfokine (PSK) peptide precursor genes, and transcripts of three subtilisin-like serine proteases, SBT1.4, SBT3.7 and SBT3.8 were found to be up-regulated in response to osmotic stress. Stress symptoms were enhanced in sbt3.8 loss-of-function mutants and could be alleviated by PSK treatment. Osmotic stress tolerance was improved in plants overexpression the precursor of PSK1 (proPSK1) or SBT3.8 resulting in higher fresh weight and improved lateral root development in the transgenic compared to wild-type plants. We further showed that SBT3.8 is involved in the biogenesis of the bioactive PSK peptide. ProPSK1 was cleaved by SBT3.8 at the C-terminus of the PSK pentapeptide. Processing by SBT3.8 depended on the aspartic acid residue adjacent to the cleavage site. ProPSK1 processing was impaired in the sbt3.8 mutant. The data suggest that increased expression in response to osmotic stress followed by the post-translational processing of proPSK1 by SBT3.8 leads to the production of PSK as a peptide signal for stress mitigation.\n\nHighlightThe expression of phytosulfokine precursor genes and processing by the subtilase SBT3.8 are upregulated in response to osmotic stress for improved drought tolerance in Arabidopsis.",

    "abstract": "Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are innate-like lymphocytes that recognize microbial vitamin B metabolites and have emerging roles in infectious disease, autoimmunity, and cancer. Although MAIT cells are identified by a semi-invariant T cell receptor, their phenotypic and functional heterogeneity is not well understood. Here we present an integrated single cell transcriptomic analysis of over 76,000 human MAIT cells during acute and chronic antigen-specific activation with the MR1 ligand 5-OP-RU and non-specific TCR stimulation. We show that MAIT cells span a broad range of homeostatic, effector, helper, tissue-infiltrating, regulatory, and exhausted phenotypes, with distinct gene expression programs associated with CD4+ or CD8+ co-expression. During acute activation, MAIT cells rapidly adopt a cytotoxic phenotype characterized by high expression of GZMB, IFNG and TNF. In contrast, chronic stimulation induces heterogeneous states defined by proliferation, cytotoxicity, immune modulation, and exhaustion. These scRNAseq-defined MAIT cell subtypes were also detected in individuals recently exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, confirming their presence during human infection. Our study provides the first comprehensive atlas of human MAIT cells in activation conditions and defines substantial functional heterogeneity, suggesting complex roles in health and disease.",

We generated a mouse model lacking lymphatic PD-L1 expression and challenged these mice with two orthotopic tumor models, B16F10 melanoma and MC38 colorectal carcinoma. Lymphatic PD-L1 deficiency resulted in a consistent expansion of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells in tumor-draining LNs in both tumor models, reduced primary tumor growth in the MC38 model, and increased the efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy in the B16F10 model. Strikingly, lymphatic PD-L1 primarily acted via apoptosis induction in tumor-specific CD8+ central memory T cells. Our findings demonstrate that LECs restrain tumor-specific immunity via PD-L1 and may explain why some cancer patients without PD-L1 expression in the tumor microenvironment still respond to PD-L1 / PD-1 targeting immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the destruction of pancreatic {beta}-cells. One of the earliest aspects of this process is development of autoantibodies and T-cells directed at an epitope in the B-chain of insulin (insB:9-23). Analysis of microbial protein sequences with homology to insB:9-23 sequence revealed 17 peptides showing >50% identity to insB:9-23. Of these, one peptide, found in the normal human gut commensal Parabacteroides distasonis, activated both human T cell clones from T1D patients and T-cell hybridomas from non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice specific to insB:9-23. Immunization of NOD mice with P. distasonis insB:9-23 peptide mimic or insB:9-23 peptide verified immune cross-reactivity. Colonization of female NOD mice with P. distasonis accelerated the development of T1D, increasing macrophages, dendritic cells and destructive CD8+ T-cells, while decreasing FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells. Western blot analysis identified P. distasonis reacting antibodies in sera of NOD mice colonized with P. distasonis and human T1D patients. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of splenocytes from P. distasonis treated mice to NOD/SCID mice enhanced disease phenotype in the recipients. Finally, analysis of human infant gut microbiome data revealed that exposure of infants to P. distasonis may modulate disease pathogenesis. Taken together, these data demonstrate the potential role for an insB:9-23-mimimetic peptide from gut microbiota as a molecular trigger or modifier of T1D pathogenesis.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTIn Type 1 diabetes (T1D), immune cells destroy pancreatic {beta}-cells. The trigger of this response, however, is unknown. Some sequences (epitopes) in the insulin molecule form a major target for this autoimmune response. We have identified a sequence in a human gut bacterium that can mimetic this insulin epitope. Immune cells specific to insulin cross-react with this bacterial mimetic. Further, this bacterium can accelerate diabetes onset in a mouse model of T1D, inducing destructive and decreasing protective immune cells. We found this mimetic in the gut of children developing T1D. Furthermore, T1D patients have a stronger immune response to this bacterium compared to healthy individuals. Taken together, this bacterial mimetic in human gut has the potential to trigger/modify T1D onset.",

Furthermore, PHB can be produced completely carbon-neutral when synthesized in the natural producer cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. This model strain has a long history of various attempts to further boost its low amounts of produced intracellular PHB of ~15 % per cell-dry-weight (CDW).\n\nWe have created a new strain that lacks the regulatory protein PirC (gene product of sll0944), which causes a rapid conversion of the intracellular glycogen pools to PHB under nutrient limiting conditions. To further improve the intracellular PHB content, two genes from the PHB metabolism, phaA and phaB from the known production strain Cupriavidus necator, were introduced under the regime of the strong promotor PpsbA2. The created strain, termed PPT1 ({Delta}sll0944-REphaAB), produced high amounts of PHB under continuous light as well under day-night rhythm. When grown in nitrogen and phosphor depleted medium, the cells produced up to 63 % / CDW. Upon the addition of acetate, the content was further increased to 81 % / CDW. The produced polymer consists of pure PHB, which is highly isotactic.\n\nThe achieved amounts were the highest ever reported in any known cyanobacterium and demonstrate the potential of cyanobacteria for a sustainable, industrial production of PHB.",

    "abstract": "Coral reef ecosystems are under threat from the frequent and severe impacts of anthropogenic climate change, particularly rising sea surface temperatures. The effects of thermal stress may be ameliorated by adaptation and/or acclimation of the host, symbiont, or holobiont (host + symbiont) to increased temperatures. We examined the role of the symbiont in promoting thermal tolerance of the holobiont, using Antillogorgia bipinnata (octocoral host) and Breviolum antillogorgium (symbiont) as a model system. We identified five distinct genotypes of B. antillogorgium from symbiont populations isolated from Antillogorgia colonies in the Florida Keys. Three symbiont genotypes were cultured and maintained at 26{degrees}C (ambient historical temperature) and two were cultured and maintained at 30{degrees}C (elevated historical temperature) for two years. Following culturing, we analyzed the growth rate and carrying capacity of each symbiont genotype at both ambient and elevated temperatures in culture (in vitro). All genotypes grew well at both temperatures, indicating thermal tolerance among these B. antillogorgium cultures. Prior culturing at the elevated temperature, however, did not result in increased thermal tolerance. We then inoculated juvenile A. bipinnata polyps with each of the five symbiont genotypes, and reared these polyps at both ambient and elevated temperatures (in hospite experiment). All genotypes were able to establish symbioses with polyps in both temperature treatments. Survivorship of polyps at 30{degrees}C was significantly lower than survivorship at 26{degrees}C, but all treatments had surviving polyps at 56 days post-infection, suggestive of broad thermal tolerance in B. antillogorgium, which may play a part in the increased resilience of Caribbean octocorals during heat stress events.",

Here we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, transport substrate accumulation studies in cell culture, and biochemical activity assays to show that P-gp actively transports A{beta}. We observed transport of A{beta}40 and A{beta}42 monomers by P-gp in explicit MD simulations of a putative catalytic cycle. In in vitro assays with P-gp overexpressing cells, we observed enhanced accumulation of fluorescently labeled A{beta}42 in the presence of Tariquidar, a potent P-gp inhibitor. We also showed that A{beta}42 stimulated the ATP hydrolysis activity of isolated P-gp in nanodiscs. Our findings expand the substrate profile of P-gp, and suggest that P-gp may contribute to the onset and progression of AD.",

    "abstract": "O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), found in the nucleus and cytoplasm of all mammalian cell types, is essential for cell proliferation. Why OGT is required for cell growth is not known. OGT performs two enzymatic reactions in the same active site. In one, it glycosylates thousands of different proteins, and in the other, it proteolytically cleaves another essential protein involved in gene expression. Deconvoluting OGTs myriad cellular roles has been challenging because genetic deletion is lethal; complementation methods have not been established. Here, we developed approaches to replace endogenous OGT with separation-of-function variants to investigate the importance of OGTs enzymatic activities for cell viability. Using genetic complementation, we found that OGTs glycosyltransferase function is required for cell growth but its protease function is dispensable. We next used complementation to construct a cell line with degron-tagged wild-type OGT. When OGT was degraded to very low levels, cells stopped proliferating but remained viable. Adding back catalytically-inactive OGT rescued growth. Therefore, OGT has an essential noncatalytic role that is necessary for cell proliferation. By developing a method to quantify how OGTs catalytic and noncatalytic activities affect protein abundance, we found that OGTs noncatalytic functions often affect different proteins from its catalytic functions. Proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation and the actin cytoskeleton were especially impacted by the noncatalytic functions. We conclude that OGT integrates both catalytic and noncatalytic functions to control cell physiology.\n\nSignificanceMammalian cells contain only one glycosyltransferase, OGT, that operates in the nucleus and cytoplasm rather than the secretory pathway. OGT is required for cell proliferation, but a basic unanswered question is what OGT functions are essential. This question is challenging to address because OGT has thousands of glycosylation substrates, two different enzymatic activities, and a large number of binding partners. Here, by establishing genetic tools to replace endogenous OGT with variants that preserve only a subset of its activities, we show that only a low level of glycosylation activity is required to maintain cell viability; however, cell proliferation requires noncatalytic OGT function(s). The ability to replace OGT with variants provides a path to identifying its essential substrates and binding partners.",

    "abstract": "Here, we demonstrate real-time multiplexed virus detection by applying DNA-directed antibody immobilization technique to a single-particle interferometric reflectance imaging sensor (SP-IRIS). In this technique, the biosensor chip surface spotted with different DNA sequences is converted to a multiplexed antibody array by flowing antibody-DNA conjugates and allowing specific DNA-DNA hybridization. The resulting antibody array is shown to detect three different recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Viruses (rVSVs) genetically engineered to express surface glycoproteins of Ebola, Marburg, and Lassa viruses in real-time in a disposable microfluidic cartridge. We also show that this method can be modified to produce a single-step, homogeneous assay format by mixing the antibody-DNA conjugates with the virus sample in solution phase prior to flowing in the microfluidic cartridge, eliminating the antibody immobilization step. This homogenous approach achieved detection of the model Ebola virus, rVSV-EBOV, at a concentration of 100 PFU/ml in 1 hour. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of this homogeneous technique as a rapid test using a passive microfluidic cartridge. A concentration of 104 PFU/ml was detectable under 10 minutes for the rVSV-Ebola virus. Utilizing DNA microarrays for antibody-based diagnostics is an alternative approach to antibody microarrays and offers advantages such as configurable sensor surface, long-term storage ability, and decreased antibody use. We believe these properties will make SP-IRIS a versatile and robust platform for point-of-care diagnostics applications.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium abscessus (MAB) is a widely disseminated pathogenic non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM). Like with M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC), excreted / secreted (ES) proteins play an essential role for its virulence and survival inside the host. ES proteins contain highly immunogenic proteins, which are of interest for novel diagnostic assays and vaccines. Here, we used a robust bioinformatics pipeline to predict the secretome of the M. abscessus ATCC 19977 reference strain and fifteen clinical isolates belonging to all three MAB subspecies, M. abscessus subsp. abscessus, M. abscessus subsp. bolletii, and M. abscessus subsp. massiliense. We found that ~18% of the proteins encoded in the MAB genomes were predicted as secreted and that the three MAB subspecies shared > 85 % of the predicted secretomes. MAB isolates with a rough (R) colony morphotype showed larger predicted secretomes than isolates with a smooth (S) morphotype. Additionally, proteins exclusive to the secretomes of MAB R variants had higher antigenic densities than those exclusive to S variants, independently of the subspecies. For all investigated isolates, ES proteins had a significantly higher antigenic density than non-ES proteins. We identified 337 MAB ES proteins with homologues in previously investigated M. tuberculosis secretomes. Among these, 222 have previous experimental support of secretion, and some proteins showed homology with protein drug targets reported in the DrugBank database. The predicted MAB secretomes showed a higher abundance of proteins related to quorum-sensing and Mce domains as compared to MTBC indicating the importance of these pathways for MAB pathogenicity and virulence. Comparison of the predicted secretome of M. abscessus ATCC 19977 with the list of essential genes revealed that 99 secreted proteins corresponded to essential proteins required for in vitro growth. All predicted secretomes were deposited in the Secret-AAR web-server (http://microbiomics.ibt.unam.mx/tools/aar/index.php).",

They respond directly to membrane tension by moving from the \"down\" to \"up\" conformation, a transition that is associated with a rise in open-probability. However, the mechanosensitive K2P (mK2P) channels can also open while occupying the down conformation, and although these channels are mostly closed, all structural models represent seemingly open conformations. To understand the dynamics between open/closed and up/down states and determine how membrane tension influences transitions between specific conformations, we use a novel method to analyze tension-driven activation of single purified and reconstituted TREK-2 channels. We screen a panel of prospective schemes to find the mechanism that best accounts for specific TREK-2 characteristics as tension-driven activation, suppression by Nor-fluoxetine, and single-channel kinetics.\n\nTo adequately describe TREK-2 behavior, mechanistic schemes require two separate tension-sensitive transitions, one that occurs between distinct down conformations and one that moves the channel between down and up states. As membrane tension activates TREK-2, it is a transition within the structural down conformations that account for the major increase in open-probability (> 100 fold); the move from down to up further promotes channel opening, but with much lower potency (~3 fold activation).",

    "abstract": "Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease manifesting in the premutation (PM) carriers of the FMR1 gene with alleles bearing 55-200 CGG repeats. The discovery of a broad spectrum of clinical and cell developmental abnormalities among PM carriers with or without FXTAS, and in model systems suggests that neurodegeneration seen in FXTAS could be the inevitable end-result of pathophysiological processes set during early development. Hence, it is imperative to trace early pathological abnormalities. Our previous studies have shown that transgenic Drosophila carrying human-derived fragile X premutation-length CGG repeats are sufficient to cause neurodegeneration. Here, we used the same transgenic Drosophila model to understand the effects of fragile X premutation-length CGG repeats on the structure and function of the developing nervous system. We show that presynaptic expression of the premutation length CGG repeats restricts synaptic growth, reduces the number of synaptic boutons, leads to aberrant presynaptic varicosities, and impairs synaptic transmission at the larval neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). The postsynaptic analysis shows both glutamate receptor and subsynaptic reticulum proteins are normal. However, a high percentage of boutons show the reduced density of Bruchpilot protein, a key component of presynaptic active zones required for vesicle release. The electrophysiological analysis shows a significant reduction in the quantal content, a measure of total synaptic vesicles released per excitation potential. Together these findings endorse that synapse perturbation caused by rCGG repeats mediate presynaptically during larval NMJ development.",

    "abstract": "Root system development is crucial for optimal growth and yield in plants, especially in sub-optimal soil conditions. The architecture of a root system is environmentally responsive, enabling the plant to exploit regions of high nutrient density whilst simultaneously minimizing abiotic stress. Despite the vital contribution of root systems to the growth of both model and crop species, we know little of the mechanisms which regulate their architecture. One factor which is relatively well understood is the transport of auxin, a plant growth regulator which defines the frequency of lateral root (LR) initiation and the rate of LR outgrowth. Here we describe a search for proteins which regulate RSA by interacting directly with a key auxin transporter, PIN1. The native separation of PIN1 identified several co-purifying proteins. Among them, AZG1 was subsequently confirmed as a PIN1 interactor. AZG1-GFP fusions co-localized with PIN1 in procambium cells of the root meristem. Roots of azg1 plants contained less PIN1 and blocking proteolysis restored PIN1 levels, observations which are consistent with PIN1 being stabilized by AZG1 in the plasma membrane. Furthermore, we show that AZG1 is a cytokinin import protein; accordingly, azg1 plants are insensitive to exogenously applied cytokinin. In wild-type plants, the frequency of LRs falls with increasing salt concentration, a response which is not observed in azg1 x azg2 plants, although their drought response is unimpaired. This report therefore identifies a potential point for auxin:cytokinin crosstalk in the environmentally-responsive determination of root system architecture.",

    "abstract": "Longitudinal models have become increasingly popular in recent years because of their power to test theoretically derived hypotheses by modeling within-person processes with repeated measures. Growth models constitute a flexible framework for modeling a range of complex trajectories across time in outcomes of interest, including non-linearities and time-varying covariates. However, these models have not thus far been expanded to include the effects of multiple growth processes at once on a single outcome. Here, I outline such an extension, showing how multiple growth processes can be modeled as a specific case of the general ability to include time-varying covariates in growth models. I show that this extension of growth models cannot be accomplished by statistical models alone, and that study design plays a crucial role in allowing for proper parameter recovery. I demonstrate these principles through simulations to mimic important theoretical conditions where modeling the effects of multiple growth processes can address developmental theory including, disaggregating the effects of age and practice or treatment in repeated assessments and modeling age- and puberty-related effects during adolescence. I compare how these models behave in two common longitudinal designs, cohort-sequential and accelerated, and how planned missingness in observations is key to parameter recovery. I conclude with directions for future substantive research using the method outlined here.",

    "abstract": "Candida albicans is a microbial fungus that exists as a commensal member of the human microbiome and an opportunistic pathogen. Cell surface-associated adhesin proteins play a crucial role in C. albicans ability to undergo cellular morphogenesis, develop robust biofilms, colonize, and cause infection in a host. However, a comprehensive analysis of the role and relationships between these adhesins has not been explored. We previously established a CRISPR-based platform for efficient generation of single- and double-gene deletions in C. albicans, which was used to construct a library of 144 mutants, comprising 12 unique adhesin genes deleted singly, or in every possible combination of double deletions. Here, we exploit this adhesin mutant library to explore the role of adhesin proteins in C. albicans virulence. We perform a comprehensive, high-throughput screen of this library, using Caenorhabditis elegans as a simplified model host system, which identified mutants critical for virulence and significant genetic interactions. We perform follow-up analysis to assess the ability of high- and low-virulence strains to undergo cellular morphogenesis and form biofilms in vitro, as well as to colonize the C. elegans host. We further perform genetic interaction analysis to identify novel significant negative genetic interactions between adhesin mutants, whereby combinatorial perturbation of these genes significantly impairs virulence, more than expected based on virulence of the single mutant constituent strains. Together, this yields important new insight into the role of adhesins, singly and in combinations, in mediating diverse facets of virulence of this critical fungal pathogen.\n\nSummaryCandida albicans is a human fungal pathogen and cause of life-threatening systemic infections.

    "abstract": "During hematopoiesis, stem and progenitor cells become progressively restricted in their differentiation potential. This process is driven by lineage-specific transcription factors and is accompanied by dynamic changes in chromatin structure. The chromatin assembly factor complex CAF-1 is a key regulator of cellular plasticity in various cell lineages in different organisms. However, whether CAF-1 sustains lineage identity during normal homeostasis is unclear. To address this question, we investigated the role of CAF-1 in myeloid progenitor cells. CAF-1 suppression in myeloid progenitors triggered their rapid commitment but incomplete differentiation toward granulocyte, megakaryocyte, and erythrocyte lineages, resulting in a mixed cellular state. Through comparison with a canonical paradigm of directed terminal myeloid differentiation, we define changes in chromatin accessibility that underlie a unique transcriptome of the aberrantly matured CAF-1 deficient cells. We further identify C/EBP and ELF1 as key transcription factors whose control of myeloid lineage commitment is kept in check by CAF-1. These findings shed new light on molecular underpinnings of hematopoiesis and suggest that manipulation of chromatin accessibility through modulating CAF-1 levels may provide a powerful strategy for controlled differentiation of blood cells.",

    "abstract": "The chemosensory system has experienced relevant changes in subterranean animals, facilitating the orientation into darkness via the perception of specific chemical signals critical to survive in this particular environment. However, the genomic basis of chemoreception in cave-dwelling fauna is largely unexplored. We generated de novo transcriptomes for antennae and body samples of the troglobitic beetle Speonomus longicornis (whose characters suggest an extreme adaptation to the deep subterranean) in order to interrogate the evolutionary origin and diversification of the chemosensory gene repertoire across coleopterans through a phylogenomic approach. Our results suggested a diminished diversity of odorant and gustatory gene repertoires compared to polyphagous epigean beetles. Moreover, S. longicornis showed a large diversity of odorant-binding proteins, suggesting an important role of these proteins in capturing airborne chemical cues. We identified a gene duplication in the ionotropic co-receptor I R25a, a highly conserved single-copy gene in protostomes involved in thermal and humidity sensing. In addition, no homologous genes to sugar receptors or the ionotropic receptor IR41a were detected. Our findings suggest that the chemosensory gene repertoire of this cave beetle may have been reshaped by the low complexity of chemical signals of this particular environment, and that gene duplication and loss may have played an important role in the evolution of genes involved in chemoreception. Altogether, our results shed light on the genomic basis of chemoreception in a cave-dwelling invertebrate and pave the road towards understanding the genomic underpinnings of adaptation to the subterranean lifestyle at a deeper level.",

The genome of R. prolixus has been recently sequenced and partially assembled, but few transcriptome analyses have been performed to date. In this study, we describe the stage-specific transcriptomes obtained from previtellogenic stages of oogenesis and from mature eggs. By analyzing ~228 million paired-end RNA-Seq reads, we significantly improved the current genome annotations for 9,206 genes. We provide extended 5 and 3 UTRs, complete Open Reading Frames, and alternative transcript variants. Strikingly, using a combination of genome-guided and de novo transcriptome assembly we found more than two thousand novel genes, thus increasing the number of genes in R. prolixus from 15,738 to 17,864. We used the improved transcriptome to investigate stage-specific gene expression profiles during R. prolixus oogenesis. Our data reveal that 11,127 genes are expressed in the early previtellogenic stage of oogenesis and their transcripts are deposited in the developing egg including key factors regulating germline development, genome integrity, and the maternal-zygotic transition. In addition, GO term analyses show that transcripts encoding components of the steroid hormone receptor pathway, cytoskeleton, and intracellular signaling are abundant in the mature eggs, where they likely control early embryonic development upon fertilization. Our results significantly improve the R. prolixus genome and transcriptome and provide novel insight into oogenesis and early embryogenesis in this medically relevant insect.",

    "abstract": "Inhibitors of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ACE2, which acts as a ligand-receptor pair that initiates the viral attachment and cellular entry of this coronavirus causing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, are of considerable interest as potential antiviral agents. While blockade of such PPIs with small molecules is more challenging than with antibodies, small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) might offer alternatives that are less strain- and mutation-sensitive, suitable for oral or inhaled administration, and more controllable / less immunogenic. Here, we report the identification of SMIs of this PPI by screening our compound-library that is focused on the chemical space of organic dyes. Among promising candidates identified, several dyes (Congo red, direct violet 1, Evans blue) and novel drug-like compounds (DRI-C23041, DRI-C91005) inhibited the interaction of hACE2 with the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV with low micromolar activity in our cell-free ELISA-type assays (IC50s of 0.2-3.0 M); whereas, control compounds, such as sunset yellow FCF, chloroquine, and suramin, showed no activity. Protein thermal shift assays indicated that the SMIs identified here bind SARS-CoV-2-S and not ACE2. Selected promising compounds inhibited the entry of a SARS-CoV-2-S expressing pseudovirus into ACE2-expressing cells in concentration-dependent manner with low micromolar IC50s (6-30 M). This provides proof-of-principle evidence for the feasibility of small-molecule inhibition of PPIs critical for coronavirus attachment/entry and serves as a first guide in the search for SMI-based alternative antiviral therapies for the prevention and treatment of diseases caused by coronaviruses in general and COVID-19 in particular.",

Levels of axonal PTBP1 increased markedly after peripheral nerve injury, and its cargos include mRNAs involved in axonal growth and regeneration, such as importin {beta}1 and RhoA. Perturbation of PTBP1 affects neuronal injury responses, axon outgrowth and sensation in vivo. Thus, PTBP1 has roles in sensory function and regenerative capacity of adult sensory neurons.

    "abstract": "The error-related negativity (ERN) is a response-locked event-related potential, occurring approximately 50 ms following an erroneous response at frontocentral electrode sites. Source localization and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research indicate that the ERN is likely generated by activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). The dACC is thought to be a part of a broader network of brain regions that collectively comprise an error-monitoring network. However, little is known about how intrinsic connectivity within the dACC-based error-monitoring network contributes to variability in ERN amplitude. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between dACC functional connectivity and ERN amplitude. In a sample of 53 highly trait-anxious individuals, the ERN was elicited in a flanker task and functional connectivity was assessed in a 10-minute resting-state fMRI scan. Results suggest that the strength of dACC seeded functional connectivity with the supplementary motor area is correlated with the {Delta}ERN (i.e., incorrect - correct responses) amplitude such that greater {Delta}ERN amplitude was accompanied by greater functional coupling between these regions. In addition to the dACC, exploratory analyses found that functional connectivity in the caudate, cerebellum, and a number of regions in the error-monitoring network were linked to variability in {Delta}ERN amplitude. In sum, ERN amplitude appears to be related to the strength of functional connectivity between error-monitoring and motor control regions of the brain.",

Here, we show that bladder infections induce expression of Ezh2, the methyltransferase of polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2)-dependent epigenetic gene silencing program. In mouse models of UTIs, urothelium-specific inactivation of PRC2 reduces the urine bacteria burden. The mutants exhibit a blunted inflammatory response likely due to the diminished activity of NF-{kappa}B signaling pathway. PRC2 inactivation also improves urothelial differentiation and attenuates basal cell hyperplasia phenotype. Moreover, the Ezh2-specific small molecule inhibitors markedly improve disease outcomes of bladder superinfection and chronic cystitis. Taken together, these findings suggest that the UTI-induced epigenetic reprograming in the bladder urothelium likely contributes to the mucosal imprint, and further suggest that targeting PRC2 methyltransferase offers a non-antibiotic strategy to mitigate UTIs.",

    "abstract": "During development, oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells myelinate central and peripheral nervous system axons, respectively, while motor exit point (MEP) glia are neural tube-derived, peripheral glia that myelinate axonal territory between these populations at MEP transition zones. From which specific neural tube precursors MEP glia are specified, and how they exit the neural tube to migrate onto peripheral motor axons, remain largely unknown. Here, using zebrafish, we found that MEP glia arise from lateral floor plate precursors and require foxd3 to delaminate and exit the spinal cord. Additionally, we show that similar to Schwann cells, MEP glial development depends on axonally-derived neuregulin1. Finally, our data demonstrate that overexpressing axonal cues is sufficient to generate additional MEP glia in the spinal cord. Overall, these studies provide new insight into how a novel population of hybrid, peripheral myelinating glia are generated from neural tube precursors and migrate into the periphery.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptomics has been widely applied in uncovering disease mechanisms and screening potential biomarkers. Internal reference selection determines the accuracy and reproducibility of data analyses. The aim of this study was to identify the most qualified reference genes for the relative quantitation analysis of transcriptomics and real-time quantitative reverse-transcription PCR in fourteen NF1 related cell lines, including non-tumor, benign and malignant Schwann cell lines. The expression characteristics of eleven candidate reference genes (RPS18, ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, PPIA, HPRT1, TBP, UBC, RPLP0, TFRC and RPL32) were screened and analyzed by four software programs: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and RefFinder. Results showed that GAPDH, the most used internal reference gene, was significantly unstable. The combinational use of two reference genes (PPIA and TBP) was optimal in malignant Schwann cell lines and the use of single reference genes (PPIA or PRLP0) alone or in combination was optimal in benign Schwann cell lines. Our recommended internal reference genes may improve the accuracy and reproducibility of the results of transcriptomics and real-time quantitative reverse-transcription PCR in further gene expression analyses of NF1 related tumors.",

To date, no agonist other than the natural effector and the diagnostic regadenoson has been approved for human use. Recently, the structure of the adenosine A1 receptor (A1R) was determined in the active, Gi protein complexed state; this has important repercussions for structure-based drug design. Here, we employed supervised molecular dynamics simulations and mutagenesis experiments to extend the structural knowledge of the binding of selective agonists to A1R. Our results identify new residues involved in the association and dissociation pathway, suggest the binding mode of N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA) related ligands, and highlight the dramatic effect that chemical modifications can have on the overall binding mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Initiation of flowering is a crucial developmental event that requires both internal and environmental signals to determine when floral transition should occur to maximize reproductive success. Ambient temperature is one of the key environmental signals that highly influence flowering time, not only seasonally but also in the context of drastic temperature fluctuation due to global warming. Molecular mechanisms of how high or low constant temperatures affect the flowering time have been largely characterized in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana; however, the effect of natural daily variable temperature outside laboratories is only partly explored. Several groups of flowering genes have been shown to play important roles in temperature responses, including two temperature-responsive transcription factors (TFs), namely PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4) and FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), that act antagonistically to regulate flowering time by activating or repressing floral integrator FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). In this study, we have demonstrated that the daily variable temperature (VAR) causes early flowering in both natural accessions Col-0, C24 and their late flowering hybrid C24xCol, which carries both functional floral repressor FLC and its activator FRIGIDA (FRI), as compared to a constant temperature (CON). The loss-of-function mutation of PIF4 exhibits later flowering in VAR, suggesting that PIF4 at least in part, contributes to acceleration of flowering in response to the daily variable temperature. We find that VAR increases PIF4 transcription at the end of the day when temperature peaks at 32 {degrees}C. The FT transcription is also elevated in VAR, as compared to CON, in agreement with earlier flowering observed in VAR. In addition, VAR causes a decrease in FLC transcription in 4-week-old plants, and we further show that overexpression of PIF4 can reduce FLC transcription, suggesting that PIF4 might also regulate FT indirectly through the repression of FLC. To further conceptualize an overall model of gene regulatory mechanisms involving PIF4 and FLC in controlling flowering in response to temperature changes, we construct a co-expression - transcriptional regulatory network by combining publicly available transcriptomic data and gene regulatory interactions of our flowering genes of interest and their partners. The network model reveals the conserved and tissue-specific regulatory functions of 62 flowering-time-relating genes, namely PIF4, PIF5, FLC, ELF3 and their immediate neighboring genes, which can be useful for confirming and predicting the functions and regulatory interactions between the key flowering genes.",

    "abstract": "Both imagery and execution of motor controls consist of interactions within a neuronal network, including frontal motor-related regions and posterior parietal regions. To reveal neural representation in the frontoparietal motor network, two approaches have been proposed thus far: one is decoding of actions/modes related to motor control from the spatial pattern of brain activity; another is to estimate directed functional connectivity, which means a directed association between two brain regions within motor regions. However, directed connectivity among multiple regions of the motor network during motor imagery (MI) or motor execution (ME) has not been investigated. Here, we attempted to characterize the directed functional connectivity within the frontoparietal motor-related networks between the MI and ME conditions. We developed a delayed sequential movement and imagery task to evoke brain activity associated with data under ME and MI via functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning. We applied a causal discovery approach, linear non-Gaussian acyclic causal model, to identify directed functional connectivity among the frontoparietal motor-related brain regions for each condition. We demonstrated higher directed functional connectivity from the contralateral dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC) to the primary motor cortex (M1) in ME than in MI. We mainly identified significant direct effects of the dPMC and ventral premotor cortex (vPMC) to the parietal regions. In particular, connectivity from the dPMC to the superior parietal lobule in the same hemisphere showed significant positive effects across all conditions. Contrastingly, interlateral connectivities from the vPMC to the superior parietal lobule showed significantly negative effects across all conditions. Finally, we found positive effects from A1 to M1 in the same hemisphere, such as the audio-motor pathway. These results indicated that the sources of motor command originated in d/vPMC influenced M1 and parietal regions as achieving ME and MI. Additionally, sequential sounds may functionally facilitate temporal motor processes.",

    "abstract": "Perceiving speech-in-noise (SIN) demands precise neural coding between brainstem and cortical levels of the hearing system. Attentional processes can then select and prioritize task-relevant cues over competing background noise for successful speech perception. In animal models, brainstem-cortical interplay is achieved via descending corticofugal projections from cortex that shape midbrain responses to behaviorally-relevant sounds. Attentional engagement of corticofugal feedback may assist SIN understanding but has never been confirmed and remains highly controversial in humans. To resolve these issues, we recorded source-level, anatomically constrained brainstem frequency-following responses (FFRs) and cortical event-related potentials (ERPs) to speech via high-density EEG while listeners performed rapid SIN identification tasks. We varied attention with active vs. passive listening scenarios whereas task difficulty was manipulated with additive noise interference. Active listening (but not arousal-control tasks) exaggerated both ERPs and FFRs, confirming attentional gain extends to lower subcortical levels of speech processing. We used functional connectivity to measure the directed strength of coupling between levels and characterize \"bottom-up\" vs. \"top-down\" (corticofugal) signaling within the auditory brainstem-cortical pathway. While attention strengthened connectivity bidirectionally, corticofugal transmission disengaged under passive (but not active) SIN listening. Our findings (i) show attention enhances the brains transcription of speech even prior to cortex and (ii) establish a direct role of the human corticofugal feedback system as an aid to cocktail party speech perception.\n\nEthics statementAll participants provided written informed consent prior in accordance with protocols approved by the University of Memphis IRB.\n\nDeclaration of interestnone",

    "abstract": "Agency, understood as the ability of an organism to control stimuli onset, modulates perceptual and attentional functions. Since stimulus encoding is an essential component of working memory (WM), we conjectured that the perceptual processs agency would positively modulate WM. To corroborate this proposition, we tested twenty-five healthy subjects in a modified-Sternberg WM task under three stimuli presentation conditions: an unpredictable presentation of encoding stimulus, self-initiated presentation of the stimulus, and self-initiation presentation with random-delay stimulus onset. Concurrently, we recorded the subjects electroencephalographic signals during WM encoding. We found that the self-initiation condition was associated with better WM accuracy, and earlier latencies of N100 and P200 evoked potential components representing visual and attentional processes, respectively. Our work demonstrates that agency enhances WM performance and accelerates early visual and attentional processes deployed during WM encoding. We also found that self-initiation presentation correlates with an increased attentional state compared to the other two conditions, suggesting a role for temporal stimuli predictability. Our study remarks on the relevance of agency in sensory and attentional processing for WM.",

    "abstract": "The H5 subtype Avian Influenza Virus has caused huge economic losses to the poultry industry and is a threat to human health. A rapid and simple test is needed to confirm infection in suspected cases during disease outbreaks. In this study, we developed a reverse-transcription recombinase-aided amplification assay for the detection of H5 subtype avian influenza virus. Assays were performed at a single temperature (39{degrees}C), and the results were obtained within 20 min. The assay showed no cross-detection with Newcastle disease virus or infectious bronchitis virus. The analytical sensitivity was 103 RNA copies per reaction at a 95% confidence interval according to probit regression analysis, with 100% specificity. Compared with published reverse-transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays, the {kappa} value of the reverse transcription recombinase-aided amplification assay in 365 avian clinical samples was 0.970 (p < 0.001). The sensitivity for avian clinical sample detection was 94.44% (95%CI, 70.63% - 99.71%), and the specificity was 100% (95%CI, 98.64% - 100%). These results indicated that our reverse-transcription recombinase-aided amplification assay may be a valuable tool for detecting H5 subtype avian influenza virus.",

    "abstract": "In mammalian cells, nutrients and growth factors signal through an array of upstream proteins to regulate the mTORC1 growth control pathway. Because the full complement of these proteins has not been systematically identified, we developed a FACS-based CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screening strategy to pinpoint genes that regulate mTORC1 activity. Along with almost all known positive components of the mTORC1 pathway, we identified many new genes that impact mTORC1 activity, including DCAF7, CSNK2B, SRSF2, IRS4, CCDC43, and HSD17B10. Using the genome-wide screening data, we generated a focused sublibrary containing single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting hundreds of genes and carried out epistasis screens in cells lacking nutrient- and stress-responsive mTORC1 modulators, including GATOR1, AMPK, GCN2, and ATF4. From these data, we pinpointed mitochondrial function as a particularly important input into mTORC1 signaling. While it is well appreciated that mitochondria signal to mTORC1, the mechanisms are not completely clear. We find that the kinases AMPK and HRI signal, with varying kinetics, mitochondrial distress to mTORC1, and that HRI acts through the ATF4-dependent upregulation of both Sestrin2 and Redd1. Loss of both AMPK and HRI is sufficient to make mTORC1 largely resistant to mitochondrial dysfunction. Taken together, our data reveal a catalog of genes that impact the mTORC1 pathway and clarify the multifaceted ways in which mTORC1 senses mitochondrial dysfunction.",
