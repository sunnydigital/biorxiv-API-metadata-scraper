    "abstract": "Sequential region labelling, also known as connected components labelling, is a standard image segmentation problem that joins contiguous foreground pixels into blobs. Despite its long development history and widespread use across diverse domains such as bone biology, materials science, and geology, connected components labelling can still form a bottleneck in image processing pipelines. Here, I describe a multithreaded implementation of classical two-pass sequential region labelling and introduce an efficient collision resolution step,  bucket fountain. Code was validated on test images and against commercial software (Avizo). It was performance tested on images from 2 MB (161 particles) to 6.5 GB (437,508 particles) to determine whether theoretical linear scaling (O(n)) had been achieved, and on 1 - 40 CPU threads to measure speed improvements due to multithreading. The new implementation achieves linear scaling (b = 0.905 - 1.052, time {propto} pixelsb; R2 = 0.985 - 0.996), which improves with increasing thread number up to 8-10 threads, suggesting that it is memory bandwidth limited. This new implementation of sequential region labelling reduces the time required from hours to a few tens of seconds for images of several GB, and is limited only by hardware scale. It is available open source and free of charge in BoneJ.",

    "abstract": "The developing CNS is exposed to physiological hypoxia, under which hypoxia inducible factor alpha (HIF) is stabilized and plays a crucial role in regulating neural development. The cellular and molecular mechanisms of HIF in developmental myelination remain incompletely understood. Previous concept proposes that HIF regulates CNS developmental myelination by activating the autocrine Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Here, by analyzing a battery of genetic mice of both sexes, we presented in vivo evidences supporting an alternative understanding of oligodendroglial HIF-regulated developmental myelination. At the cellular level, we found that HIF was required for developmental myelination by transiently controlling upstream OPC differentiation but not downstream oligodendrocyte maturation and that HIF dysregulation in OPCs but not oligodendrocytes disturbed normal developmental myelination. We demonstrated that HIF played a minor, if any, role in regulating canonical Wnt signaling in the oligodendroglial lineage or in the CNS. At the molecular level, blocking autocrine Wnt signaling did not affect HIF-regulated OPC differentiation and myelination. We further identified HIF-Sox9 regulatory axis as an underlying molecular mechanism in HIF-regulated OPC differentiation. Our findings support a concept shift in our mechanistic understanding of HIF-regulated CNS myelination from the previous Wnt-dependent view to a Wnt-independent one and unveil a previously unappreciated HIF-Sox9 pathway in regulating OPC differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Social animals benefit from their groupmates, so why do they sometimes kill each others offspring? Using 30 years of data from multiple groups of wild spotted hyenas, we address three critical aims for understanding infanticide in any species: (1) quantify the contribution of infanticide to overall mortality (2) describe the circumstances under which infanticide occurs and (3) evaluate hypotheses about the evolution of infanticide. We find that, although observed only rarely, infanticide is in fact a leading source of juvenile mortality. Infanticide accounted for 24% of juvenile mortality, and 1 in 10 hyenas born in our population perished due to infanticide. In all observed cases of infanticide, killers were adult females, but victims could be of both sexes. Of four hypotheses regarding the evolution of infanticide, we found the most support for the hypothesis that infanticide in spotted hyenas reflects competition over social status among matrilines.",

    "abstract": "Annotating all cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) and transcription factor (TF) binding sites(TFBSs) in genomes remains challenging. We tackled the task by integrating putative TFBSs motifs found in available 6,092 datasets covering 77.47% of the human genome. This approach enabled us to partition the covered genome regions into a CRM candidate (CRMC) set (56.84%) and a non-CRMC set (43.16%). Intriguingly, like known enhancers, the predicted 1,404,973 CRMCs are under strong evolutionary constraints, suggesting that they might be cis-regulator. In contrast, the non-CRMCs are largely selectively neutral, suggesting that they might not be cis-regulatory. Our method substantially outperforms three state-of-the-art methods (GeneHancers, EnhancerAtlas and ENCODE phase 3) for recalling VISTA enhancers and ClinVar variants, as well as by measurements of evolutionary constraints. We estimated that the human genome might encode about 1.46 million CRMs and 67 million TFBSs, comprising about 55% and 22% of the genome, respectively; for both of which, we predicted 80%. Therefore, the cis-regulatory genome appears to be more prevalent than originally thought.",

Their comprehensive experimental characterisation is generally not feasible, particularly for unculturable organisms. In principle, the full range of metabolic capabilities can be computed from an organisms annotated genome using metabolic network reconstruction. However, current computational methods cannot deal with genome-scale metabolic networks. Part of the problem is that these methods aim to enumerate all metabolic pathways, while computation of all (elementally balanced) conversions between nutrients and products would suffice. Indeed, the elementary conversion modes (ECMs, defined by Urbanczik and Wagner) capture the full metabolic capabilities of a network, but the use of ECMs has not been accessible, until now. We extend and explain the theory of ECMs, implement their enumeration in ecmtool, and illustrate their applicability. This work contributes to the elucidation of the full metabolic footprint of any cell.",

Furthermore, most patients show features of idiopathic scoliosis, reduced bone mineral density and in a few cases osteopenia. While several clinical cases and studies have documented the skeletal deformities in CHARGE syndrome bearing CHD7 mutations, the underlying mechanisms of the disorder remain elusive. Here, we detect and quantitatively analyze skeletal abnormalities in larval and adult chd7-/- zebrafish.\n\nWe show that young chd7-/- larvae present with abnormal craniofacial development, especially related to cartilage. We also observe scoliosis-like spinal deformations at 9 dpf. Gene expression analysis confirmed the reduction of osteoblast markers and Ppar{gamma} targets. MicroCT analyses identified abnormal craniofacial structures, Weberian apparatus and vertebral body morphology in chd7-/- mutants, with highly mineralized inclusions, along with significant variances in bone mineral density and bone volume. Notably, we detect a specific depletion of Col2a1a in the cartilage of craniofacial regions and vertebrae, in line with a significantly reduced number of chondrocytes.\n\nOur study is the first to elucidate the mechanisms underlying morphological changes in craniofacial structure and vertebrae of adult chd7-/- zebrafish. The chd7-/- mutant zebrafish will be beneficial in future investigations of the underlying pathways of both craniofacial and spinal deformities commonly seen in CHARGE syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance has become a major public health concern as bacteria evolve to evade drugs, leading to recurring infections and a decrease in antibiotic efficacy. Systematic efforts have revealed mechanisms involved in resistance; yet, in many cases, how these specific mechanisms accelerate or slow the evolution of resistance remains unclear. Here, we conducted a systematic study of the impact of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump on the evolution of antibiotic resistance. We mapped how population growth rate and resistance change over time as a function of both the antibiotic concentration and the parent strains genetic background. We compared the wild type strain to a strain overexpressing AcrAB-TolC pumps and a strain lacking functional pumps. In all cases, resistance emerged when cultures were treated with chloramphenicol concentrations near the MIC of their respective parent strain. The genetic background of the parent strain also influenced resistance acquisition. The wild type strain evolved resistance within 24 h through mutations in the acrAB operon and its associated regulators. Meanwhile, the strain overexpressing AcrAB-TolC evolved resistance more slowly than the wild type strain; this strain achieved resistance in part through point mutations in acrB and the acrAB promoter. Surprisingly, the strain without functional AcrAB-TolC efflux pumps still gained resistance, which it achieved through upregulation of redundant efflux pumps. Overall, our results suggest that treatment conditions just above the MIC pose the largest risk for the evolution of resistance and that AcrAB-TolC efflux pumps impact the pathway by which chloramphenicol resistance is achieved.\n\nIMPORTANCECombatting the rise of antibiotic resistance is a significant challenge. Efflux pumps are an important contributor to drug resistance; they exist across many cell types and can export numerous classes of antibiotics. Cells can regulate pump expression to maintain low intracellular drug concentrations. Here, we explored how resistance emerged depending on the antibiotic concentration, as well as the presence of efflux pumps and their regulators. We found that treatments near antibiotic concentrations that inhibit the parent strains growth were most likely to promote resistance. While wild type, pump overexpression, and pump knock out strains were all able to evolve resistance, they differed in the absolute level of resistance evolved, the speed at which they achieved resistance, and the genetic pathways involved. These results indicate that specific treatment regimens may be especially problematic for the evolution of resistance and that the strain background can influence how resistance is achieved.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have successfully addressed several challenges, such as performance, scalability, or sample efficiency associated with the use of this technology. Although RL algorithms bear relevance to psychology and neuroscience in a broader context, they lack biological plausibility. Motivated by recent neural findings demonstrating the capacity of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex to gather space and time information from the environment, this study presents a novel RL model, called spacetime Q-Network (STQN), that exploits predictive spatiotemporal encoding to reliably learn highly uncertain environment. The proposed method consists of two primary components. The first component is the successor representation with theta phase precession implements hippocampal spacetime encoding, acting as a rollout prediction. The second component, called Q switch ensemble, implements prefrontal population coding for reliable reward prediction. We also implement a single learning rule to accommodate both hippocampal-prefrontal replay and synaptic homeostasis, which subserves confidence-based metacognitive learning. To demonstrate the capacity of our model, we design a task array simulating various levels of environmental uncertainty and complexity. Results show that our model significantly outperforms a few state-of-the-art RL models. In the subsequent ablation study, we showed unique contributions of each component to resolving task uncertainty and complexity. Our study has two important implications. First, it provides the theoretical groundwork for closely linking unique characteristics of the distinct brain regions in the context of RL. Second, our implementation is performed in a simple matrix form that accommodates expansion into biologically-plausible, highly-scalable, and generalizable neural architectures.",

    "abstract": "Given the unsurpassed sound-sensitivity of mosquitoes among arthropods and the sound-source power required for long-range hearing, we investigated the distance over which female mosquitoes detect species-specific cues in the sound of station-keeping mating swarms. A common misunderstanding, that mosquitoes cannot hear at long-range because their hearing organs are  particle-velocity receptors, has clouded the fact that particle-velocity is an intrinsic component of sound whatever the distance to the sound source. We exposed free-flying Anopheles coluzzii females to pre-recorded sounds of male An. coluzzii and An. gambiae s.s. swarms over a range of natural sound-levels. Sound-levels tested were related to equivalent distances between the female and the swarm for a given number of males, enabling us to infer distances over which females might hear large male-swarms. We show that females do not respond to swarm sound up to 48 dB SPL and that louder SPLs are not ecologically relevant for a swarm. Considering that swarms are the only mosquito sound-source that would be loud enough to be heard at long-range, we conclude that inter-mosquito acoustic communication is restricted to close-range pair interactions. We also showed that the sensitivity to sound in free-flying males is much enhanced compared to that of tethered ones.",

    "abstract": "Identification and quantification of fish diet diversity was the first step in understanding the food web dynamics and ecosystem energetics, where the contribution of DNA barcoding technique has been important. We used DNA barcoding to identify the stomach contents of a euryhaline, benthophagous catfish Ariius maculatus. From 40 catfish stomach items sampled in two different seasons, we barcoded 67 piscine and macro-invertebrates prey items, identified as belonging to 13 species in 4 major phyla (viz., Chordate, Arthropod, Annelida and Mollusca). It is important to note that the mollusc taxa (Meritrix meritrix and Perna viridis) and a species of fish (Stolephorus indicus) could not be found among the gut contents of A. maculatus sampled during the pre- and post-monsoon season, respectively. Among the piscine diets of A. maculatus, Eubleekeria splendens (23.5%) and Stolephorus indicus (23.5%) were the major prey taxa during pre-monsoon season. The hermit crabs forms the major constituents of both pre- and post-monsoon seasons, among invertebrate taxa. Polychaete, Capitella capitata (25.92%) was abundantly consumed invertebrates next to hermit crabs. We noticed that in pre-monsoon A. maculatus was more piscivorous than post-monsoon. As revealed through Kimura-2 parametric pair{-}wise distance analysis, the diet diversity was relatively higher in post-monsoon. The accumulation curve estimated 57 haplotypes within 14 barcoded species (including the host A. maculatus). Majority of haplotypes were found among fishes (47.36%) followed by Arthropods (28.07%), Annelids (14.03%) and Mollusca (10.52%), respectively. This study also highlights that there is a growing concern about A. maculatuss aggressive predation on commercially important stocks of fish and invertebrates. We will continue to expand the coverage of species barcoded in the reference database, which will become more significant as meta- and environmental DNA barcoding techniques become cheaper and prevalent.",

    "abstract": "Climate change induced increases in global ocean temperature represent the greatest threat to the persistence of reef ecosystems and most coral populations are projected to experience temperatures above their current bleaching thresholds annually by 2050. Adaptation to higher temperatures is necessary if corals are to persist in a warming future. While many aspects of heat stress have been well studied, few data are available for predicting the capacity for adaptive cross-generational responses in corals. Consistent sets of heat tolerant genomic markers that reliably predict thermal tolerance have yet to be identified. To address this knowledge gap, we quantified the heritability and genetic variation associated with heat tolerance in Platygyra daedalea from the Great Barrier Reef. We tracked the survival of quantitative genetic crosses of larvae in a heat tolerance selection experiment. We also identified allelic shifts in heat-selected survivors compared with paired, non-selected controls. The narrow-sense heritability of survival under heat stress was 0.66 and a total of 1,069 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with different survival probabilities. While 148 SNPs were shared between several experimental crosses, no common SNPs were identified for all crosses suggesting that specific combinations of many markers are responsible for heat tolerance. However, we found two regions that overlap with previously identified loci associated with heat tolerance in Persian Gulf populations of P. daedalea reinforcing the importance of these markers for heat tolerance. These results illustrate the importance of high heritability and the complexity of the genomic architecture underpinning host heat tolerance. These findings suggest that this P. daedalea population has the genetic prerequisites for adaptation to increasing temperatures. This study also provides knowledge for the development of high throughput genomic tools to screen for variation within and across populations to enhance adaptation through assisted gene flow and assisted migration.",

However, these target cell-specific properties have not been well investigated in human cortex, where there are major technical challenges in reliably identifying cell types. Here, we take advantage of newly developed methods for human neurosurgical tissue analysis with multiple patch-clamp recordings, post-hoc fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and prospective GABAergic AAV-based labeling to investigate synaptic properties between pyramidal neurons and PVALB- vs. SST- positive interneurons. We find that there are robust molecular differences in synapse-associated genes between these neuron types, and that individual presynaptic pyramidal neurons evoke postsynaptic responses with heterogeneous synaptic dynamics in different postsynaptic cell types. Using molecular identification with FISH and classifiers based on transcriptomically identified PVALB neurons analyzed with Patch-seq methods, we find that PVALB neurons typically show depressing synaptic characteristics, whereas other interneuron types including SST-positive neurons show facilitating characteristics. Together, these data support the existence of target cell-specific synaptic properties in human cortex that are similar to rodent, thereby indicating evolutionary conservation of local circuit connectivity motifs from excitatory to inhibitory neurons and their synaptic dynamics.",

We identified a set of TET2-mediated demethylation events that are specific to toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4 stimulation. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-specific demethylation occurs at genomic sites that have low accessibility in quiescent monocytes, concomitantly with the transcriptional activation of many inflammation-related genes, and they are enriched in binding motifs for several signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family members. Indeed, STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5, elements of the JAK2 pathway, are phosphorylated in association with the acquisition of endotoxin tolerance. Inhibition of the JAK2 pathway impairs the activation of tolerized genes on the first encounter with LPS. This is evidence of a crucial role for this pathway in determining the initial response of these genes to bacterial antigens and provides a pharmacological target to prevent exacerbated responses, allowing regulated responses upon subsequent challenges. Finally, we assess the pathological relevance of the JAK2 pathway in monocytes from patients with sepsis.",

    "abstract": "Studies on \"HIT&RUN\" effects by viral protein are difficult when using traditional affinity precipitation-based techniques under dynamic conditions, because only proteins interacting at a specific instance in time can be precipitated by affinity purification. Recent advances in proximity labeling (PL) have enabled study of both static and dynamic protein-protein interactions. Here we applied PL method with recombinant Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). KSHV, a gamma-herpesvirus, uniquely encodes four interferon regulatory factors (IRFs 1-4) in the genome, and we identified KSHV vIRF-1 and vIRF-4 interacting proteins during reactivation. Fusion of mini-TurboID with vIRF-1 or vIRF-4 did not interfere with KSHV gene expression, DNA replication, or de novo infections. PL identified 213 and 70 proteins for vIRF-1 and vIRF-4 respectively, which possibly interact during KSHV reactivation, and 47 of those were shared between the two vIRFs; the list also includes three viral proteins, ORF17, thymidine kinase, and vIRF-4. Functional annotation of respective interacting proteins showed highly overlapping biological functions such as mRNA processing and transcriptional regulation by TP53. Involvement of commonly interacting 44 cellular proteins in innate immune regulation were examined by siRNAs, and we identified that splicing factor 3B (SF3B) family proteins were clearly involved in interferons transcription and suppressed KSHV reactivation. We propose that recombinant TurboID-KSHV is a powerful tool to probe key cellular proteins that play a role in KSHV replication, and selective splicing factors may have a function beyond connecting two exon sequences to regulate innate immune responses.\n\nImportanceViral protein interaction with a host protein shows at least two sides: (i) taking host protein functions for its own benefit and (ii) disruption of existing host protein complex formation to inhibit undesirable host responses. Due to use of affinity-precipitation approaches, the majority of our studies focused on how the virus takes advantage of the newly-formed protein interactions for its own replication. Proximity labeling (PL) however, can also highlight the transient and negative effects - those interactions which lead to dissociation from the existing protein complex. Here we highlight the power of PL in combination with recombinant KSHV to study viral host interactions.",

Whereas human desmin protein is encoded by a single gene, two desmin paralogs (desma and desmb) exist in zebrafish. Desma and desmb show differential spatiotemporal expression during zebrafish embryonic and larval development, being similarly expressed in skeletal muscle until hatching, after which expression of desmb shifts to gut smooth muscle. We generated knockout (KO) mutant lines carrying loss-of-function mutations for each gene by using CRISPR/Cas9. Mutants are viable and fertile, and lack obvious skeletal muscle, heart or intestinal defects. In contrast to morphants, knockout of each gene did not cause any overt muscular phenotype, but did alter calcium flux in myofibres.

    "abstract": "Landscape structure influences the spread of plant pathogens, primarily by affecting pathogen dispersal. Coffee leaf rust (Hemileia vastatrix), a fungal disease that causes heavy economic losses in the coffee industry, is likely to be affected by landscape structure via dispersal of its wind-borne spores. Previous studies have found positive associations between leaf rust incidence and the proportion of pasture cover, suggesting that deforestation may facilitate rust spore dispersal. We explored this idea by modeling the spread of rust transmission in simulated landscapes. Specifically, we modeled within-patch transmission using a probabilistic cellular automata model, and between-patch transmission using a random walk with spore movement inhibited by forest canopy cover. We used this model to understand how the spread of coffee rust is affected by: 1) clustering of coffee plants, 2) clustering of deforestation, and 3) proportion of landscape deforestation. We found that clustering of coffee plants is the primary driver of rust transmission, affecting the likelihood and severity of rust outbreak. Deforestation is important in landscapes with high clustering of coffee: rust outbreaks are more severe in landscapes with a higher proportion of deforested areas, and more variable in landscapes where deforested areas are more evenly dispersed throughout the landscape.",

    "abstract": "No endemic Madagascar animal with body mass >10 kg survived a relatively recent wave of extinction on the island. From morphological and isotopic analyses of skeletal  subfossil remains we can reconstruct some of the biology and behavioral ecology of giant lemurs (primates; up to ~160 kg), elephant birds (up to ~860 kg), and other extraordinary Malagasy megafauna that survived well into the past millennium. Yet much about the evolutionary biology of these now extinct species remains unknown, along with persistent phylogenetic uncertainty in some cases. Thankfully, despite the challenges of DNA preservation in tropical and sub-tropical environments, technical advances have enabled the recovery of ancient DNA from some Malagasy subfossil specimens. Here we present a nuclear genome sequence (~2X coverage) for one of the largest extinct lemurs, the koala lemur Megaladapis edwardsi (~85kg). To support the testing of key phylogenetic and evolutionary hypotheses we also generated new high-coverage complete nuclear genomes for two extant lemur species, Eulemur rufifrons and Lepilemur mustelinus, and we aligned these sequences with previously published genomes for three other extant lemur species and 47 non-lemur vertebrates. Our phylogenetic results confirm that Megaladapis is most closely related to the extant Lemuridae (typified in our analysis by E. rufifrons) to the exclusion of L. mustelinus, which contradicts morphology-based phylogenies. Our evolutionary analyses identified significant convergent evolution between M. edwardsi and extant folivorous primates (colobine monkeys) and ungulate herbivores (horses) in genes encoding protein products that function in the biodegradation of plant toxins and nutrient absorption. These results suggest that koala lemurs were highly adapted to a leaf-based diet, which may also explain their convergent craniodental morphology with the small-bodied folivore Lepilemur.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive therapy is an evolution-based treatment approach that aims to maintain tumor volume by employing minimum effective drug doses or timed drug holidays. For successful adaptive therapy outcomes, it is critical to find the optimal timing of treatment switch points. Mathematical models are ideal tools to facilitate adaptive therapy dosing and switch time points. We developed two different mathematical models to examine interactions between drug-sensitive and resistant cells in a tumor. The first model assumes genetically fixed drug-sensitive and resistant populations that compete for limited resources. Resistant cell growth is inhibited by sensitive cells. The second model considers phenotypic switching between drug-sensitive and resistant cells. We calibrated each model to fit melanoma patient biomarker changes over time and predicted patient-specific adaptive therapy schedules. Overall, the models predict that adaptive therapy would have delayed time to progression by 6-25 months compared to continuous therapy with dose rates of 6%-74% relative to continuous therapy. We identified predictive factors driving the clinical time gained by adaptive therapy. The first model predicts 6-20 months gained from continuous therapy when the initial population of sensitive cells is large enough, and when the sensitive cells have a large competitive effect on resistant cells. The second model predicts 20-25 months gained from continuous therapy when the switching rate from resistant to sensitive cells is high and the growth rate of sensitive cells is low. This study highlights that there is a range of potential patient specific benefits of adaptive therapy, depending on the underlying mechanism of resistance, and identifies tumor specific parameters that modulate this benefit.",

The narrowing of the lumen of the brain vasculature contributes to the increased incidence of stroke. While hyalinosis represents the major pathological lesions contributing to the vascular lumen narrowing and stroke, the pathogenic mechanism of brain vascular hyalinosis has not been well characterized. Thus, the present study examined the postmortem brain vasculature of human patients who died of ischemic stroke due to systemic hypertension. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry showed the occurrence of brain vascular hyalinosis with infiltrated plasma proteins along with the narrowing of vasa vasorum and oxidative stress. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the endothelial cell bulge protrusion into the vasa vasorum lumen and the occurrence of endocytosis in the vasa vasorum endothelium. The treatment of cultured microvascular endothelial cells with adrenaline also promoted the formation of the bulge as well as endocytic vesicles. siRNA knockdown of sortin nexin-9 (a mediator of clathrin-mediated endocytosis) inhibited the adrenaline-induced endothelial cell bulge formation. Adrenaline promoted protein-protein interactions between sortin nexin-9 and neural Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (a regulator of actin polymerization). We propose that endocytosis-depending endothelial cell bulge narrows the vasa vasorum, resulting in ischemic oxidative damage to the cerebral vessels, the formation of hyalinosis, the occurrence of ischemic stroke, and death in systemic hypertension patients.",

    "abstract": "Over 2.8 million people experience mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the United States each year, which may lead to long-term neurological dysfunction. The mechanical forces that occur due to TBI propagate through the brain to produce diffuse axonal injury (DAI) and trigger secondary neuroinflammatory cascades. The cascades may persist from acute to chronic time points after injury, altering the homeostasis of the brain. However, the relationship between the hallmark axonal pathology of diffuse TBI and potential changes in glial cell activation or morphology have not been established in a clinically relevant large animal model at chronic time points. In this study, we assessed tissue from pigs subjected to rapid head rotation in the coronal plane to generate mild TBI. Neuropathological assessments for axonal pathology, microglial morphological changes, and astrocyte reactivity were conducted in specimens out to 1 year post injury. We detected an increase in overall amyloid precursor protein pathology, as well as periventricular white matter and fimbria/fornix pathology after a single mild TBI. We did not detect changes in corpus callosum integrity or astrocyte reactivity. However, detailed microglial skeletal analysis revealed changes in morphology, most notably increases in the number of microglial branches, junctions, and endpoints. These subtle changes were most evident in periventricular white matter and certain hippocampal subfields, and were observed out to 1 year post injury in some cases. These ongoing morphological alterations suggest persistent change in neuroimmune homeostasis. Additional studies are needed to characterize the underlying molecular and neurophysiological alterations, as well as potential contributions to neurological deficits.",

    "abstract": "Calcium (Ca2+)-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs or CPKs) are a unique family of Ca2+-sensor/kinase-effector proteins with diverse functions in plants. In Arabidopsis thaliana, CPK28 contributes to immune homeostasis by promoting degradation of the key immune signaling receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase BOTRYTIS-INDUCED KINASE 1 (BIK1), and additionally functions in vegetative-to-reproductive stage transition. How CPK28 controls these seemingly disparate pathways is unknown. Here, we identify a single phosphorylation site in the kinase domain of CPK28 (Ser318) that is differentially required for its function in immune homeostasis and stem elongation. We show that CPK28 undergoes intra- and inter-molecular auto-phosphorylation on Ser318 and can additionally be trans-phosphorylated on this residue by BIK1. Analysis of several other phosphorylation sites demonstrates that Ser318 phosphorylation is uniquely required to prime CPK28 for Ca2+ activation at physiological concentrations of Ca2+, possibly through stabilization of the Ca2+-bound active state as indicated by intrinsic fluorescence experiments. Together, our data indicate that phosphorylation of Ser318 is required for the activation of CPK28 at low intracellular [Ca2+] to prevent initiation of an immune response in the absence of infection. By comparison, phosphorylation of Ser318 is not required for stem-elongation, indicating pathway specific requirements for phosphorylation-based Ca2+-sensitivity priming. We additionally provide evidence for a conserved function for Ser318 phosphorylation in related group IV CDPKs which holds promise for biotechnological applications by generating CDPK alleles that enhance resistance to microbial pathogens without consequences to yield.",

Recent evidence suggests that STN can also cancel an already selected action when goals change, a key aspect of cognitive control. However, there is little neurophysiological evidence for a dissociation between selecting and cancelling actions in the human STN. We recorded single neurons in the STN of humans performing a stop-signal task. Movement-related neurons suppressed their activity during successful stopping whereas stop-signal neurons activated at low-latencies regardless of behavioral outcome. In contrast, STN and motor-cortical beta-bursting occurred only later in the stopping process. Task-related neuronal properties varied by recording location from dorsolateral movement to ventromedial stop-signal tuning. Therefore, action selection and cancellation coexist in STN but are anatomically segregated. These results show that human ventromedial STN neurons carry fast stop-related signals suitable for implementing cognitive control.",

    "abstract": "Individual fingers in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) are known to be represented separately and adjacently, forming a cortical hand map. Electrophysiological studies in monkeys show that finger amputation triggers increased selectivity to the neighbouring fingers within the deprived S1, causing local reorganisation. Neuroimaging research in humans, however, shows persistent S1 finger representation of the missing hand, even decades after amputation. We aimed to resolve these apparently contrasting evidence by examining finger representation in humans following pharmacological  amputation using single-finger nerve block and 7T neuroimaging. We hypothesised that beneath the apparent selectivity of individual fingers in the hand map, peripheral and central processing is distributed across fingers. If each finger contributes to the cortical representation of the others, then localised input loss will weaken finger representation across the hand map. For the same reason, the non-blocked fingers will stabilise the blocked fingers representation, resulting in persistent representation of the blocked finger. Using univariate selectivity profiling, we replicated the electrophysiological findings of local S1 reorganisation. However, more comprehensive analyses confirmed that local blocking reduced representation of all fingers across the entire hand area. Importantly, multivariate analysis demonstrated that despite input loss, representation of the blocked finger remained persistent and distinct from the unblocked fingers. Computational modelling suggested that the observed findings are driven by distributed processing underlying the topographic map, combined with homeostatic mechanisms. Our findings suggest that the long-standing depiction of the somatosensory hand map is misleading. As such, accounts for map reorganisation, e.g. following amputation, need to be reconsidered.",

    "abstract": "Hydra vulgaris is an emerging model organism for neuroscience due to its small size, transparency, genetic tractability, and regenerative nervous system; however, fundamental properties of its sensorimotor behaviors remain unknown. Here, we use microfluidic devices combined with fluorescent calcium imaging and surgical resectioning to study how the diffuse nervous system coordinates Hydras mechanosensory response. Mechanical stimuli cause animals to contract, and we find this response relies on at least two distinct networks of neurons in the oral and aboral regions of the animal. Different activity patterns arise in these networks depending on whether the animal is contracting spontaneously or contracting in response to mechanical stimulation. Together, these findings improve our understanding of how Hydras diffuse nervous system coordinates sensorimotor behaviors. These insights help reveal how sensory information is processed in an animal with a diffuse, radially symmetric neural architecture unlike the dense, bilaterally symmetric nervous systems found in most model organisms.",

    "abstract": "Soundscape studies aim to consider the holistic human perception of a sound environment, including both the physical phenomena and how these are mediated by internal factors: the mechanisms underpinning the interactions between these two aspects are not well understood. This study aims to assess the influence of psychological well-being and demographic factors including age, gender, occupation status, and education levels on the dimensions of the soundscape circumplex, i.e., Pleasantness and Eventfulness. Data was collected in eleven urban locations in London through a large-scale (N=1134) soundscape survey according to the ISO 12913-2 technical specifications and incorporating the WHO-5 well-being index. Linear mixed-effects modelling applying backwards-step feature selection was used to model the interactions between internal factors including psychological well-being, age, gender, occupation status, education levels and the soundscape Pleasantness and Eventfulness, while accounting for the random effects of the survey location. The findings suggest that internal factors account for approximately 1.4% of the variance for Pleasantness and 3.9% for Eventfulness, while the influence of the locations accounted for approximately 34% and 14%, respectively. Psychological well-being is positively associated with perceived Pleasantness, while there is a negative association with Eventfulness only for males. Occupation status, in particular retirement as a proxy of age and gender, was identified as a significant factor for both dimensions. These findings offer empirical grounds for developing theories of the interaction between internal factors and soundscape formation whilst highlighting the importance of the location, namely: the context.",

    "abstract": "Normal cellular processes give rise to toxic metabolites that cells must mitigate. Formaldehyde is a universal stressor and potent metabolic toxin that is generated in organisms from bacteria to humans. Methylotrophic bacteria such as Methylorubrum extorquens face an acute challenge due to their production of formaldehyde as an obligate central intermediate of single-carbon metabolism. Mechanisms to sense and respond to formaldehyde were speculated to exist in methylotrophs for decades but had never been discovered. Here we identify a member of the DUF336 domain family, named efgA for enhanced formaldehyde growth, that plays an important role in endogenous formaldehyde stress response in M. extorquens PA1 and is found almost exclusively in methylotrophic taxa. Our experimental analyses reveal that EfgA is a formaldehyde sensor that inhibits translation in response to elevated levels of formaldehyde. Heterologous expression of EfgA in Escherichia coli increases formaldehyde resistance, indicating that its interaction partners are widespread and conserved and may include translational machinery. EfgA represents the first example of a formaldehyde stress response system that does not involve enzymatic detoxification. Thus, EfgA comprises a unique stress response mechanism in bacteria, whereby a single protein directly senses elevated levels of a toxic intracellular metabolite and modulates translational activity.",

Mouse NLRP1B can be activated through proteolytic cleavage by the bacterial Lethal Toxin (LeTx) protease, resulting in degradation of the N-terminal domains of NLRP1B and liberation of the bioactive C-terminal domain, which includes the caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD). However, a natural pathogen-derived effector that can activate human NLRP1 remains unknown. Here, we use an evolutionary model to identify several proteases from diverse picornaviruses that cleave human NLRP1 within a rapidly evolving region of the protein, leading to host-specific and virus-specific activation of the NLRP1 inflammasome. Our work demonstrates that NLRP1 acts as a \"tripwire\" to recognize the enzymatic function of a wide range of viral proteases, and suggests that host mimicry of viral polyprotein cleavage sites can be an evolutionary strategy to activate a robust inflammatory immune response.",

    "abstract": "Predation shapes communities through consumptive and non-consumptive effects, where in the latter prey respond to perceived predation risk through risk management strategies occurring at different spatial and temporal scales. The landscape of fear concept is useful to better understand how predation risk affects prey behavioral decisions and distribution, and more generally the spatial dimension of predator-prey relationships. We assessed the effects of the predation risk landscape in a terrestrial Arctic community, where arctic fox is the main predator of ground-nesting bird species. Using high frequency GPS data, we developed a predator activity landscape resulting from fox space use patterns, and validated with an artificial prey experiment that it generated a predation risk landscape. We then investigated the effects of the fox activity landscape on multiple prey, by assessing the anti-predator behavior of a primary prey (snow goose) and the nest distribution of several incidental prey. Areas highly used by foxes were associated with a stronger level of nest defense by snow geese. We further found a lower probability of occurrence of incidental prey nests in areas highly used by foxes, but only for species nesting in habitats easily accessible to foxes. Species nesting in refuges consisting of micro-habitats limiting fox accessibility, like islets, did not respond to the fox activity landscape. Consistent with the scale of the fox activity landscape, this result reflected the capacity of refuges to allow bird nesting without regard to predation risk in the surrounding area. We demonstrated the value of using predator space use patterns to infer spatial variation in predation risk and better understand its effects on prey in landscape of fear studies. We also exposed the diversity of prey risk management strategies, hence refining our understanding of the mechanisms driving species distribution and community structure.",

    "abstract": "Assessing the phylogenetic compatibility between individual gene families is a crucial and often computationally demanding step in many phylogenomics analyses. Here we describe the Evolutionary Similarity Index (IES) to assess shared evolution between gene families using a weighted Orthogonal Distance Regression applied to sequence distances. This approach allows for straightforward pairing of paralogs between co-evolving gene families without resorting to multiple tests, or a priori assumptions of molecular interactions between protein products from assessed genes. The utilization of pairwise distance matrices, while less informative than phylogenetic trees, circumvents error-prone comparisons between trees whose topologies are inherently uncertain. Analyses of simulated gene family evolution datasets showed that IES was more accurate and less susceptible to noise than popular tree-based methods (Robinson-Foulds and geodesic distance) for assessing evolutionary signal compatibility, since it bypasses phylogenetic reconstruction and its inherent uncertainty. Applying IES to a real dataset of 1,322 genes from 42 archaeal genomes identified eight major clusters of gene families with compatible evolutionary trends. Four of these clusters included genes with a taxonomic distribution across all archaeal phyla, while other clusters included a subset of taxa that do not map to generally accepted archaeal clades, indicating possible shared horizontal transfers by clustered gene families. We identify one strongly connected set of 62 genes from the same cluster, occurring as both single-copy and multiple homologs per genome, with compatible phylogenetic reconstructions closely matching previously published species trees for Archaea.

    "abstract": "The alkylphosphocholine (APC) class of antineoplastic and antiprotozoal drugs, such as edelfosine and miltefosine, are structural mimics of lyso-phosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC), and are inhibitory to the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae at low micromolar concentrations. Cytotoxic effects related to inhibition of phospholipid synthesis, induction of an unfolded protein response, inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation, and disruption of lipid rafts have been attributed to members of this drug class, however the molecular mechanisms of action of these drugs remain incompletely understood. Cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of the alkylphosphocholines exhibit variability with regard to chemical structure, leading to differences in effectiveness against different organisms or cell types. We now report the comprehensive identification of Saccharomyces cerevisiae titratable-essential gene and haploid non-essential gene deletion mutants that are resistant to the APC drug miltefosine (hexadecyl-O-phosphocholine). 58 strains out of ~5600 tested displayed robust and reproducible resistance to miltefosine. This gene set was heavily enriched in functions associated with vesicular transport steps, especially those involving endocytosis and retrograde transport of endosome derived vesicles to the Golgi or vacuole, suggesting a role for these trafficking pathways in transport of miltefosine to potential sites of action in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrion. In addition, we identified mutants with defects in phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate synthesis (TetO::STT4) and hydrolysis (sac1{Delta}), an oxysterol binding protein homolog (osh2{Delta}), a number of ER resident proteins, and multiple components of the eisosome. These findings suggest that ER-plasma membrane contact sites and retrograde vesicle transport are involved in the interorganelle transport of lyso-PtdCho and related lyso-phospholipid-like analogs to their intracellular sites of cytotoxic activity.",

    "abstract": "mRNA translation and degradation are strongly interconnected processes that participate in the fine tuning of gene expression. Particularly, targeting mRNAs to translation-dependent degradation (TDD) could attenuate protein expression by making any increase in mRNA translation self-limiting. However, the extent to which TDD is a general mechanism for limiting protein expression is currently unknown. Here we describe a comprehensive analysis of basal and signal-induced TDD in mouse primary CD4 T cells. Our data indicate that most cellular transcripts are decayed to some extent in a translation-dependent manner, both in resting and activated cells. Our analysis further identifies the length of untranslated regions, the density of ribosomes and the GC content of the coding region as major determinants of TDD magnitude. Consistent with this, all transcripts that undergo changes in ribosome density upon T cell activation display a corresponding change in their TDD level. Surprisingly, the amplitude of translation-independent mRNA decay (TID) appears as a mirror image of TDD. Moreover, TID also responds to changes in ribosome density upon T cell activation but in the opposite direction from the one observed for TDD. Our data demonstrate a strong interconnection between mRNA translation and decay in mammalian cells. Furthermore, they indicate that ribosome density is a major determinant of the pathway by which transcripts are degraded within cells.",

However, as with any type of expression data, cross-dataset benchmarking of spatial data is a crucial first step. Here, we assess the replicability, with reference to canonical brain sub-divisions, between the Allen Institutes in situ hybridization data from the adult mouse brain (ABA) and a similar dataset collected using Spatial Transcriptomics (ST). With the advent of tractable spatial techniques, for the first time we are able to benchmark the Allen Institutes whole-brain, whole-transcriptome spatial expression dataset with a second independent dataset that similarly spans the whole brain and transcriptome.\n\nResultsWe use LASSO, linear regression, and correlation-based feature selection in a supervised learning framework to classify expression samples relative to their assayed location. We show that Allen reference atlas labels are classifiable using transcription, but that performance is higher in the ABA than ST. Further, models trained in one dataset and tested in the opposite dataset do not reproduce classification performance bi-directionally. Finally, while an identifying expression profile can be found for a given brain area, it does not generalize to the opposite dataset.\n\nConclusionsIn general, we found that canonical brain area labels are classifiable in gene expression space within dataset and that our observed performance is not merely reflecting physical distance in the brain. However, we also show that cross-platform classification is not robust. Emerging spatial datasets from the mouse brain will allow further characterization of cross-dataset replicability.",

    "abstract": "MGA, a transcription factor and member of the MYC network, is mutated or deleted in a broad spectrum of malignancies. As a critical test of a tumor suppressive role, we inactivated Mga in two mouse models of non-small cell lung cancer using a CRISPR based approach. MGA loss significantly accelerated tumor growth in both models and led to de-repression of atypical Polycomb PRC1.6, E2F and MYC-MAX targets. Similarly, MGA depletion in human lung adenocarcinoma lines augmented invasive capabilities. We further show that MGA, E2F6 and L3MBTL2 co-occupy thousands of promoters and that MGA stabilizes PRC1.6 subunits. Lastly, we report that MGA loss has also a pro-growth effect in human colon organoids. Our studies establish MGA as a bona fide tumor suppressor in vivo and suggest a tumor suppressive mechanism in adenocarcinomas resulting from widespread transcriptional attenuation of MYC and E2F targets mediated by an atypical Polycomb complex containing MGA-MAX dimers.",

    "abstract": "Plant small RNAs (sRNAs) are important regulatory elements that fine-tune gene expression and maintain genome integrity by silencing transposons. They have critical roles in most pathways involved in plant growth and reproductive development. Reproductive organs of monocots produce abundant phased, small interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs). The 21-nt reproductive phasiRNAs triggered by miR2118 are highly enriched in pre-meiotic anthers, and have not been described in eudicots. The 24-nt reproductive phasiRNAs are triggered by miR2275, and are highly enriched during meiosis in many angiosperms. Here, we describe additional variants of 21-nt reproductive phasiRNAs, including those triggered by miR11308 in wild strawberry, a eudicot, and we validate the presence of this pathway in rose. We report the widespread presence of the 21-nt reproductive phasiRNA pathway in eudicots, with novel biogenesis triggers in the basal eudicot columbine and the rosid flax. In eudicots, these 21-nt phasiRNAs are enriched in pre-meiotic stages, a spatiotemporal distribution consistent with that of monocots and suggesting a role in anther development. Although this pathway is apparently absent in well-studied eudicot families including the Brassicaceae, Solanaceae and Fabaceae, our work in eudicots supports a singular finding in spruce, indicating that the pathway of 21-nt reproductive phasiRNAs emerged in seed plants and was lost in some lineages.",

    "abstract": "One of the most important factors in decision making is estimating the value of available options. Subregions of the prefrontal cortex, including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), have been deemed essential for this process. Value computations require a complex integration across numerous dimensions, including, reward magnitude, effort, internal state, and time. The importance of the temporal dimension is well-illustrated by temporal discounting tasks, in which subjects select between smaller-sooner versus larger-later rewards. The specific role of OFC in telling time and integrating temporal information into decision making remains unclear. Based on the current literature, in this review we reevaluate current theories of OFC function, accounting for the influence of time. Incorporating temporal information into value estimation and decision making requires distinct, yet interrelated, forms of temporal information including the ability to tell time, represent time, create temporal expectations, and the ability to use this information for optimal decision making in a wide range of tasks, including temporal discounting and wagering. We use the term  temporal cognition to refer to the integrated use of these different aspects of temporal information. We suggest that the OFC may be a critical site for the integration of reward magnitude and delay, and thus important for temporal cognition.",

    "abstract": "Upon awakening from nighttime sleep, the stress hormone cortisol exhibits a burst in the morning within 30-minutes in humans. This cortisol awakening response (CAR) is thought to prepare the brain for upcoming challenges. Yet, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the CAR-mediated  preparation function remains unknown. Using blood-oxygen-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI) with a dedicated prospective design and pharmacological manipulation, we investigated this proactive mechanism in humans across two fMRI studies. In Study 1, we found that a robust CAR was predictive of less hippocampal and prefrontal activity, though enhanced functional coupling between those regions and facilitated working memory performance, during a demanding task later in the afternoon. These results implicate the CAR in proactively promoting brain preparedness based on improved neural efficiency. To address the causality of this proactive effect, we conducted a second study (Study 2) in which we suppressed the CAR with a double blind, placebo controlled, randomized design using Dexamethasone. We found that pharmacological suppression of CAR mirrored the proactive effects from Study 1. Dynamic causal modeling analyses further revealed a reduction of prefrontal top-down modulation over hippocampal activity when performing a cognitively demanding task in the afternoon. These findings establish a causal link between the CAR and its proactive role in optimizing brain functional networks involved in neuroendocrine control and memory.",

    "abstract": "White matter hyperintensities (WMH) of presumed vascular origin are frequently found in MRIs of healthy older adults. WMH are also associated with aging and cognitive decline. Here, we compared and validated three freely available algorithms for WMH extraction: FreeSurfer, UBO Detector, and BIANCA (Brain Intensity AbNormality Classification Algorithm) using a longitudinal dataset comprising MRI data of cognitively healthy older adults (baseline N = 231, age range 64-87 years). As reference we manually segmented WMH in T1w, 3D FLAIR, 2D FLAIR images. These manual segmentations were then used to assess the segmentation accuracy of the different automated algorithms. Further, we assessed the relationships of WMH volume estimates provided by the algorithms with Fazekas scores and age. FreeSurfer underestimated the WMH volumes and scored worst in Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC = 0.434) but its WMH volumes strongly correlated with the Fazekas scores (rs = 0.73). BIANCA accomplished the highest DCS (0.602) with 3D FLAIR images. However, the relations with the Fazekas scores were only moderate, especially in the 2D FLAIR images (rs = 0.41), and many outlier WMH volumes were detected when exploring within-person trajectories (2D FLAIR: ~30%). UBO Detector performed similarly to BIANCA in DSC with both modalities and reached the best DSC in 2D FLAIR (0.531) without requiring a tailored training dataset. In addition, it achieved very high associations with the Fazekas scores (2D FLAIR: rs = 0.80).\n\nIn summary, our results emphasize the importance of carefully contemplating the choice of the WMH segmentation algorithm and MR-modality.",

Both effects were PKC-dependent. Parallel recordings of synaptic currents and nitric oxide (NO)-related fluorescence changes indicated that the increased frequency, related to pre-synaptic release, was dependent on a NO-mediated retrograde signaling. Moreover, increased synchronization in NO production was also observed in neurons neighboring those dialyzed with iA{beta}o, indicating that iA{beta}o can increase network excitability at a distance. Current-clamp recordings suggested that iA{beta}o increased neuronal excitability via AMPA-driven synaptic activity without altering membrane intrinsic properties.\n\nConclusionThese results strongly indicate that iA{beta}o causes functional spreading of hyperexcitability through a synaptic-driven mechanism and offer an important neuropathological significance to intracellular species in the initial stages of AD, which include brain hyperexcitability and seizures.",

New genes may quickly build their own network in the genomes, exert important functions, and generate novel phenotypes. Dating gene age and inferring the origination mechanisms of new genes, like primate-specific gene, is the basis for the functional study of the genes. However, no comprehensive resource of gene age estimates across species is available.

We also collected gene age estimate data from other studies and uniformed the gene age estimates to time ranges in million years for comparison across studies. All the data were cataloged into GenOrigin (http://genorigin.chenzxlab.cn/), a userfriendly new database of gene age estimates, where users can browse gene age estimates by species, age and gene ontology. In GenOrigin, the information such as gene age estimates, annotation, gene ontology, ortholog and paralog, as well as detailed gene presence/absence views for gene age inference based on the species tree with evolutionary timescale, was provided to researchers for exploring gene functions.",

    "abstract": "Disseminated tumour cells frequently exhibit a period of dormancy that renders them insensitive to targeting by chemotherapeutic agents, conversely the systemic delivery of chemotherapies can result in normal tissue damage. Using multiple mouse and human breast cancer models, we demonstrate that prior chemotherapy administration enhances metastatic colonisation and outgrowth. In vitro, chemotherapy treatment induces fibroblast senescence associated with a senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that accelerates 3D tumour spheroid growth. These chemotherapy-treated fibroblasts, and their pro-tumourigenic function, can be effectively eliminated by targeting the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-xL. In vivo, chemotherapy treatment induces SASP expression in normal tissues, however the accumulation of senescent cells is limited and BCL-xL inhibitors are unable to reduce chemotherapy-enhanced metastasis. This likely reflects that chemotherapy-exposed normal tissues support metastatic colonisation via the secretion of pro-tumourigenic factors and remodelling of the extracellular matrix, but that damaged stromal cells do not enter a full BCL-xL-dependent senescence or switch their dependency to other anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members. In summary, this study highlights the role of the metastatic microenvironment in controlling outgrowth of disseminated tumour cells and the need to identify novel therapeutic approaches to effectively limit the pro-tumourigenic effects of chemotherapy-induced normal tissue damage.",

    "abstract": "Prostate cancers generally lack T cell infiltration and display resistance to immune checkpoint therapies (ICT). We found that intermittent but not daily dosing of PI3K/{beta}/{delta} inhibitor BAY1082439 on a Pten-null spontaneous prostate cancer model could overcome ICT resistance and unleash CD8+ T cell-dependent anti-tumor immunity in vivo. Mechanistically, BAY1082439 converts Pten-null cancer cell-intrinsic immune-suppression to immune-stimulation by promoting IFN/{gamma} pathway activation, {beta}2-microglubin expression and CXCL10/CCL5 secretion. Together with its preferential Treg inhibition activity, BAY1082439 promotes clonal expansion of tumor-associated CD8+ T cells. Once primed, tumors remain as T cell-inflamed and become responsive to anti-PD-1 therapy. Our data suggest that intermittent PI3K inhibition can alleviate Pten-null cancer cell-intrinsic immunosuppressive activity and turn \"cold\" tumors into T cell-inflamed ones, paving the way for successful ICT.\n\nSignificanceThe combination of ICT and targeted therapies holds great promises for broad and long-lasting therapeutic effects for cancers. However, combining ICT with anti-PI3K inhibitors have been difficult because the multifaceted effects of PI3K on both cancer cells and immune cells within the tumor microenvironment. Here we show a carefully designed anti-PI3K treatment, both in its specificity and dosing schedule, to inhibit cancer cell growth while promoting anti-tumor immunity, is critically important for successful ICT. Since the PI3K pathway is one of the most frequently altered signaling pathways in human cancers, our work may shed light on treating those cancers with PI3K activation and overcome resistance to ICT.\n\nHighlightsO_LIIntermittent PI3K/{beta}/{delta} inhibitor BAY1082439 treatment overcomes ICT resistance\nC_LIO_LIBAY1082439 turns Pten-null prostate cancer from \"cold\" to T cell-inflamed\nC_LIO_LIBAY1082439 inhibits cancer cell-intrinsic immunosuppressive activity and Treg\nC_LIO_LIBAY1082439 promotes clonal expansion and immunity of tumor-associated CD8+ T cells\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Clinical outcomes for patients with ovarian and uterine cancers have not improved greatly in the past twenty years. To identify ovarian and uterine cancer vulnerabilities, we analyzed genome-scale CRISPR/ Cas9 loss-of-function screens across 739 human cancer cell lines. We found that many ovarian cancer cell lines overexpress the phosphate importer SLC34A2, which renders them sensitive to loss of the phosphate exporter XPR1. We extensively validated the XPR1 vulnerability in cancer cell lines and found that the XPR1 dependency was retained in vivo. Overexpression of SLC34A2 is frequently observed in tumor samples and is regulated by PAX8 -a transcription factor required for ovarian cancer survival. XPR1 overexpression and copy number amplifications are also frequently observed. Mechanistically, SLC34A2 overexpression and impaired phosphate efflux leads to the accumulation of intracellular phosphate and cell death. We further show that proper localization and phosphate efflux by XPR1 requires a novel binding partner, KIDINS220. Loss of either XPR1 or KIDINS220 results in acidic vacuolar structures which precede cell death. These data point to the XPR1:KIDINS220 complex - and phosphate dysregulation more broadly -as a therapeutic vulnerability in ovarian cancer.",

    "abstract": "Periods of cognitive disengagement, such as rest or sleep, are thought to support the progressive consolidation of episodic memories. During these states, the hippocampus displays transient high-frequency oscillatory bursts, known as ripples, which are thought to promote interactions with the neocortex, consolidating memory traces. More recent findings have suggested ripples in the human hippocampus may also occur during task engagement, particularly for tasks requiring episodic memory processes. However, it is unclear if hippocampal ripples occur during other cognitive states or whether ripple properties are modulated by specific types of task demands. In addition, identifying genuine hippocampal ripple events in the human brain can be methodological challenging. To address these questions, we used intracranial recordings from the human hippocampus to quantify ripple events across perceptual, memory and resting task states. Using spectro-temporal identification of hippocampal ripples, we observed highly similar ripple event properties across tasks, with a modest yet significant increase in ripple properties (rate, duration & amplitude) during resting task states. These ripple event attributes did not differ between hemisphere, nor across or within the time of day examined. Supporting data further highlighted that while hippocampal ripples occurred during all task states, these rates were typically lower than that observed during sleep. Together, these findings highlight that hippocampal ripples occur consistently, but sparsely, during a broad range of cognitive task states. Such findings may be incorporated into existing models of systems consolidation, whereby hippocampal ripples help to initially establish latent memory traces.",

    "abstract": "The prefrontal cortex and hippocampus are crucial for memory-guided decision-making. Neural activity in the hippocampus exhibits place-cell sequences at multiple timescales, including slow behavioral sequences ([~]seconds) and fast theta sequences ([~]100-200 ms) within theta oscillation cycles. How prefrontal ensembles interact with hippocampal sequences to support decision-making is unclear. Here, we examined simultaneous hippocampal and prefrontal ensemble activity during learning of a spatial working-memory decision task. We found clear theta sequences in prefrontal cortex, nested within its behavioral sequences. In both regions, behavioral sequences maintained representations of current goals during navigation. In contrast, hippocampal theta sequences encoded alternatives for deliberation, and were coordinated with prefrontal theta sequences that predicted upcoming choices. During error trials, these representations were preserved to guide ongoing behavior, whereas replay sequences during inter-trial periods were impaired prior to navigation. These results establish cooperative interaction between hippocampal and prefrontal sequences at multiple timescales for memory-guided decision making.",

    "abstract": "Non-fibrillar oligomers formed via nucleation from amyloid beta (AB) peptides are currently implicated in the neurotoxicity of Alzheimers disease. Thus, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms underlying their formation is important for identifying targets for drug therapies. This is however an enduring challenge due to the inability to detect AB nucleation processes in the lag phase from bulk kinetic assays, while time-course analyses using a series of peptide solutions involve the discontinuous observation of dynamic nucleation processes and pathways. In this study, by adjusting the pH of AB42 peptide samples while simultaneously imaging with high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM), we show the in-situ, continuous visualization of dynamic AB42 nucleation at the molecular level. The process reveals a pH-induced saturation regime, enabling a critical monomer substrate concentration to initiate the birth of nucleation. A number of key nucleation phases are identified, including pre-nucleation, saturation regime (mass surface adsorption), nucleation and post-nucleation growth, eventually leading to the formation of predominately oligomer species. HS-AFM observations further reveal the distinct, molecular processes associated with each nucleation phase that constitute the path-dependent formation of different AB species, namely an intial monomer \"diffuse-like\" surface layer, followed by the emergence of nuclei and then subsequent formation and growth of new complexes and oligomers. In particular, the ability of individual nuclei to undergo surface diffusion and establish new complexes via binding interactions with other species encountered in the system was found to be a significant mechanism influencing the growth of oligomers. Herein, the study contributes to current AB nucleation theories by ascribing new molecular mechanisms. More generally, the knowledge gained from single molecule techniques can greatly assist in our current understanding of various biological processes of AB peptide such as nucleation, growth, aggregation and their related kinetic pathways.",

    "abstract": "CD4 and CD8 co-receptors define distinct lineages of T cells restricted by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class II and I molecules, respectively. Co-receptors interact with the T cell receptor (TCR) at the surface of MHC-restricted T cells to facilitate antigen recognition, thymic selection, and functional differentiation. T cells also recognize lipid antigens presented by CD1 molecules, but the role that CD4 and CD8 play in lipid antigen recognition is unknown. We studied the effect of CD4 and CD8 on the avidity, activation, and function of T cells specific for two CD1b-presented mycobacterial lipid antigens, glucose monomycolate (GMM) and diacylated sulfoglycolipids (SGL). In a human cohort study using SGL-loaded CD1b tetramers, we discovered a hierarchy among SGL-specific T cells in which T cells expressing the CD4 or CD8 co-receptor stain with a higher tetramer mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) than CD4-CD8- T cells. To determine the role of the TCR co-receptor in lipid antigen recognition, we exogenously expressed GMM and SGL-specific TCRs in Jurkat or polyclonal T cells and quantified tetramer staining and activation thresholds. Transduced CD4+ primary T cells bound the lipid-loaded CD1b tetramer with a higher MFI than CD8+ primary T cells, and transduced CD8+ Jurkat cells bound the SGL-CD1b tetramer with higher MFI than CD4-CD8- Jurkat cells. The presence of either co-receptor also decreased the threshold for IFN-{gamma} secretion. Further, co-receptor expression increased surface expression of CD3{varepsilon}, suggesting a mechanism for increased tetramer binding and activation. Finally, we used single-cell sequencing to define the TCR repertoire and ex vivo functional profiles of SGL-specific T cells from individuals with M.tb disease. We found that CD8+ T cells specific for SGL express canonical markers associated with cytotoxic T lymphocytes, while CD4+ T cells could be classified as T regulatory or T follicular helper cells. Among SGL-specific T cells, only those expressing the CD4 co-receptor also expressed Ki67, suggesting that they were actively proliferating at the time of sample collection. Together, these data reveal that expression of CD4 and CD8 co-receptor modulates TCR avidity for lipid antigen, leading to functional diversity and differences in in vivo proliferation during M.tb disease.",

    "abstract": "RNA modifications are dynamic chemical entities that regulate RNA fate, and an avenue for environmental response in neuronal function. However, which RNA modifications may be playing a role in neuronal plasticity and environmental responses is largely unknown. Here we characterize the biochemical function and cellular dynamics of two human RNA methyltransferases previously associated with neurological dysfunction, TRMT1 and its homolog, TRMT1-like (TRMT1L). Using a combination of next-generation sequencing, LC-MS/MS, patient-derived cell lines and knockout mouse models, we confirm the previously reported dimethylguanosine (m 2,2 G) activity of TRMT1 in tRNAs, as well as reveal that TRMT1L, whose activity was unknown, is responsible for methylating a subset of cytosolic tRNA Ala (AGC) isoacceptors at position 26. Using a cellular in vitro model that mimics neuronal activation and long term potentiation, we find that both TRMT1 and TRMT1L change their subcellular localization upon neuronal activation. Specifically, we observe a major subcellular relocalization from mitochondria and other cytoplasmic domains (TRMT1) and nucleoli (TRMT1L) to different small punctate compartments in the nucleus, which are as yet uncharacterized. This phenomenon does not occur upon heat shock, suggesting that the relocalization of TRMT1 and TRMT1L is not a general reaction to stress, but rather a specific response to neuronal activation. Our results suggest that subcellular relocalization of RNA modification enzymes play a role in neuronal plasticity and transmission of information, presumably by addressing new targets.",

    "abstract": "Changes in epidermal pigmentation are associated with eye defects in humans and other vertebrates. In the rock pigeon (Columba livia), the sex-linked Almond color pattern is characterized by hypopigmentation of epidermal structures. The trait is controlled by the classical Stipper (St) locus, and homozygous (ZStZSt) Almond males often have severe eye defects. Heterozygous (ZStZ+) and hemizygous (ZStW) pigeons do not typically have obvious eye defects, suggesting that higher dosage of the mutant allele is deleterious. Because Almond pigeons have pronounced hypopigmentation in epidermal structures, we hypothesized that they might also have reduced eye pigmentation. Here, we examined pigmentation in the iris, ciliary body, anterior retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), and posterior RPE in pigeons with and without Almond alleles. We found that pigmentation of anterior segment structures was reduced in birds with at least one Almond allele. However, posterior eye pigmentation was substantially reduced only in homozygous Almond birds. We postulate that the gradient of effects on eye pigmentation is due to the different embryological origins of anterior and posterior eye pigment-producing cells.",

    "abstract": "Applying quantifiable metrics to validate the success of restoration efforts is crucial for ongoing management programs in anthropogenically fragmented habitats. Estimates of dispersal can provide such baseline data because they measure not only the extent to which restored patches are colonized and interconnected, but also their metapopulation source/sink dynamics. In this context, we estimated dispersal and population connectivity among prairie (Microtus ochrogaster; N=231) and meadow vole (M. pennsylvanicus; N=83), sampled from eight restored plots at five tallgrass prairie sites embedded within the agricultural matrix of midwestern North America. Our expectation was that extensive distances separating these restored habitats (i.e., 48-246 km) would spatially isolate vole metapopulations, resulting in significant genetic differentiation. We first used molecular taxonomy to validate the field-identifications of all sampled individuals, then used pairwise FST derived from 15 microsatellite DNA loci to estimate genetic connectivity among the species-delimited study populations. Metapopulation stability was gauged by assessing migration rates and deriving effective population sizes (Ne). We also calculated relatedness values (r) as a potential surrogate for contact in prairie vole, a primary vector for Lyme disease. Molecular species-assignments contravened field-identifications in 25% of samples (11 prairie/67 meadow) and identified two instances of species-hybridization (0.6%). Local effects (i.e., population crash/drought) were manifested at two sites, as documented by significant temporal declines in Ne and r. Overall, high migration rates and non-significant (10/15) pairwise FST values underscored elevated metapopulation connectivity. A single site that recorded five significant FST values also displayed significant r-values indicating the inadvertent sampling of closely related individuals. This highlights the close social groupings among cooperatively-breeding prairie vole that can exacerbate Lyme disease transmission. Thus, while elevated population connectivity aligns with prairie restoration goals, it also reinforces a need in adaptive management to evaluate environmental matrices for their permeability to vector-borne diseases.",

Impacts of local and regional extirpation of species have been demonstrated to propagate through the complex interaction networks they are part of, subsequently leading to secondary extinctions, exacerbating biodiversity loss. Contemporary ecological theory has developed several measures to analyse the structure and robustness of ecological networks under biodiversity loss. However, a toolbox for direct simulation and quantification of extinction cascades and the creation of novel interactions (i.e. rewiring) remains absent.\nC_LIO_LIHere, we present NetworkExtinction - a novel R package which we have developed to explore the propagation of species extinctions sequences through ecological networks as well as quantify the effects of rewiring potential in response to primary species extinctions. With NetworkExtinction we have integrated ecological theory and computational simulations to develop functionality with which users may analyze and visualize the structure and robustness of ecological networks. The core functions introduced with NetworkExtinction focus on simulations of sequential primary extinctions and associated secondary extinctions while allowing for user-specified secondary extinction thresholds and realisation of rewiring potential.\nC_LIO_LIWith the package NetworkExtinction, users can estimate the robustness of ecological networks after performing species extinction routines based on several algorithms. Moreover, users can compare the number of simulated secondary extinctions against a null model of random extinctions. In-built visualizations enable graphing topological indices calculated by the deletion sequence functions after each simulation step. Finally, the user can define the degree distribution of the network by fitting different common distributions. Here, we illustrate the use of the package and its outputs by analyzing a Chilean coastal marine food web.\nC_LIO_LINetworkExtinction is a compact and easy-to-use R package with which users can quantify changes in ecological network structure in response to different patterns of species loss, thresholds, and rewiring potential. Therefore, this package is particularly useful to evaluate ecosystem responses to anthropogenic and environmental perturbations that produce non-random species extinctions.\nC_LI",

For this purpose, the Open Data Infrastructure for Social Science and Economic Innovations (ODISSEI) consortium has supported the development of the ODISSEI Secure Supercomputer (OSSC) platform that allows researchers to link cohort data to data from Statistics Netherlands and run analyses in a high performance computing (HPC) environment.\n\nMethodsAfter successful record linkage genome-wide association (GWA) analyses were carried out on expenditure for total health, mental health, primary and hospital care and medication. Record linkage for genotype data from 16,726 participants from the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR) with data from Statistics Netherlands was accomplished in the secure OSSC platform, followed by gene-based tests and estimation of total and SNP-based heritability.\n\nResultsThe total heritability of expenditure ranged between 29.4 (SE 0.8) and 37.5 (SE 0.8) per cent, but GWA analyses did not identify single SNPs or genes that were genome-wide significantly associated with health care expenditure. SNP-based heritability was between 0.0 (SE 3.5) and 5.4 (SE 4.0) per cent and was different from zero for mental health care and primary care expenditure.\n\nConclusionsWe successfully linked genotype data to administrative health care expenditure data from Statistics Netherlands and performed a series of analyses on health care expenditure.

This technique has been used to produce large reductions in energy expenditure during walking with exoskeletons but has not yet been applied to prosthetic devices. In this series of case studies, we applied human-in-the-loop optimization to the control of an active ankle-foot prosthesis used by participants with unilateral transtibial amputation. We optimized the parameters of five control architectures that captured aspects of successful exoskeletons and commercial prostheses, but none resulted in significantly lower metabolic rate than generic control. In one control architecture, we increased the exposure time per condition by a factor of five, but the optimized controller still resulted in higher metabolic rate. Finally, we optimized for self-reported comfort instead of metabolic rate, but the resulting controller was not preferred. There are several reasons why human-in-the-loop optimization may have failed for people with amputation. Control architecture is an unlikely cause given the variety of controllers tested. The lack of effect likely relates to adaptation protocol or differences in the learning mechanisms or objectives of people with amputation. Future work should investigate these causes to determine whether human-in-the-loop optimization for prostheses could be successful.",

Positioning up to ten nuclease-dead Cas12a (dCas12a) proteins along a 48.5 kbp DNA template triggers particle growth and full DNA encapsidation at limiting polypeptide concentrations. Particle growth rate was further increased when dCas12a was dimerized with a polymerization silk-like domain. Such improved self-assembly efficiency allows for discrimination between cognate versus non-cognate DNA templates by the synthetic polypeptide.

    "abstract": "MotivationIdentifying regions of the genome that demonstrate significant differences in DNA methylation between groups of samples is an important problem in computational epigenetics. Available methods assume that methylation occurs in a statistically independent manner at individual cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites or perform analysis using empirically estimated joint probability distributions of methylation patterns at no more than 4 contiguous CpG sites. These approaches can lead to poor detection performance and loss of reliability and reproducibility due to reduced specificity and sensitivity in the presence of insufficient data.\n\nResultsTo accommodate data obtained with different bisulfite sequencing technologies, such as RRBS, ERRBS, and WGBS, and improve statistical power, we developed CpelTdm.jl, a Julia package for targeted differential analysis of DNA methylation stochasticity between groups of unmatched or matched samples. This package performs rigorous statistical analysis of methylation patterns within regions of the genome specified by the user that takes into account correlations in methylation and results in robust detection of genomic regions exhibiting statistically significant differences in methylation stochasticity. CpelTdm.jl does not only detect mean methylation differences, as it is commonly done by previous methods, but also differences in methylation entropy and, more generally, between probability distributions of methylation.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationThis Julia package is supported for Windows, MacOS, and Linux, and can be freely downloaded from GitHub: https://github.com/jordiabante/CpelTdm.jl.\n\nContactsjabante1@jhu.edu or goutsias@jhu.edu.",

    "abstract": "Non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphomas (B-NHL) mainly develop within lymph nodes as densely packed aggregates of tumor cells and their surrounding microenvironment, creating a tumor niche specific to each lymphoma subtypes. Until now, in vitro preclinical models mimicking biomechanical forces, cellular microenvironment, and 3D organization of B lymphomas remain scarce while all these parameters constitute key determinants of lymphomagenesis and drug resistance. Using a microfluidic method based on the encapsulation of cells inside permeable, elastic, and hollow alginate microspheres, we developed a new tunable 3D-model incorporating extracellular matrix and/or stromal cells. Lymphoma B cells and stromal cells dynamically formed self-organized 3D spheroids, thus initiating a coevolution of these two cell types, reflecting their bidirectional crosstalk, and recapitulating the heterogeneity of B-NHL subtypes. In addition, this approach makes it suitable to assess in a relevant in vitro model the activity of new therapeutic agents in B-NHL.",

This study was designed 1) to determine the acute toxicity of VX in male rhesus monkeys by subcutaneous administration, 2) to evaluate the efficacy of a transdermal patch containing physostigmine and procyclidine. The median lethal dose (LD50) of the subcutaneous injection of VX was 15.409 ug/kg, which was calculated using the up-and-down dose selection procedure based on deaths occurring within 48 h. To test the efficacy of the transdermal patch, rhesus monkeys were treated with a patch (5x5 cm2) alone or in combination with post-exposure therapy comprising atropine plus 2-pralidoxime (2-PAM), and then administered subcutaneous injection of VX at various doses. The rhesus monkeys pretreated with the patch alone were 100% protected against 1.5xLD50 of VX, while the rhesus monkeys treated with the patch, atropine, and 2-PAM were 100% protected against 50xLD50 of VX. This study demonstrated that patch pretreatment in conjunction with atropine and 2-PAM treatment is an effective regimen against high doses of VX.",

    "abstract": "Functional outcomes (e.g., subjective percepts, emotions, memory retrievals, decisions, etc...) are partly determined by external stimuli and/or cues. But they may also be strongly influenced by (trial-by-trial) uncontrolled variations in brain responses to incoming information. In turn, this variability provides information regarding how stimuli and/or cues are processed by the brain to shape behavioral responses. This can be exploited by brain-behavior mediation analysis to make specific claims regarding the contribution of brain regions to functionally-relevant input-output transformations. In this work, we address four challenges of this type of approach, when applied in the context of mass-univariate fMRI data analysis: (i) we quantify the specificity and sensitivity profiles of different variants of mediation statistical tests, (ii) we evaluate their robustness to hemo-dynamic and other confounds, (iii) we identify the sorts of brain mediators that one can expect to detect, and (iv) we disclose possible interpretational issues and address them using complementary information-theoretic approaches. En passant, we propose a computationally efficient algorithmic implementation of the approach that is amenable to whole-brain exploratory analysis. We also demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of brain-behavior mediation analysis in the context of an fMRI study of decision under risk. Finally, we discuss the limitations and possible extensions of the approach.",

    "abstract": "The localization and translation of mRNAs to dendrites and axons maintains and modifies the local proteome of neurons, and is essential for synaptic plasticity. Although significant efforts have allowed the identification of localized mRNAs in excitatory neurons, it is still unclear whether interneurons also localize a large population of mRNAs. In addition, the variability in the population of localized mRNAs within and between cell-types is unknown. Here we developed a method for the transcriptomic characterization of a single neurons subcellular compartments, which combines laser capture microdissection with scRNA-seq. This allowed us to separately profile the dendritic and somatic transcriptomes of individual rat hippocampal neurons and investigate the relation in mRNA abundances between the soma and dendrites of single glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. We identified two types of glutamatergic and three types of GABAergic interneurons and we found that, like their excitatory counterparts, interneurons contain a rich repertoire of ~4000 mRNAs. The individual somatic transcriptomes exhibited more cell type-specific features than their associated dendritic transcriptomes. The detection and abundance of dendritic mRNAs was not always simply predicted by their somatic counterparts. Finally, using cell-type specific metabolic labelling of isolated neurites, we demonstrated that the processes not only of Glutamatergic but also of GABAergic neurons are capable of local translation, suggesting mRNA localization and local translation is a general property of neurons.",

Previous studies have reported functional segregation along the transverse axis of CA1 correlated with the functional differences in MEC and LEC. pCA1 shows higher spatial selectivity than dCA1 in these studies. We employ a double rotation paradigm, which creates an explicit conflict between local and global cues, to understand differential contributions of these reference frames to the spatial code in pCA1 and dCA1. We show that pCA1 and dCA1 respond differently to this local-global cue conflict. pCA1 shows incoherent response consistent with the strong conflicting inputs it receives from MEC and distal CA3 (dCA3). In contrast, dCA1 shows a more coherent rotation with global cues. In addition, pCA1 and dCA1 display comparable levels of spatial selectivity in this study. This finding differs from the previous studies, perhaps due to richer sensory information available in our behavior arena. Together these observations indicate that the functional segregation along proximodistal axis of CA1 is not merely of the amount of spatial selectivity but that of the nature of the different inputs utilized to create and anchor spatial representations.",

Here, we developed a quantitative image analysis pipeline in concert with mapping of molecular markers for mining >2,000,000 images and >1,300 metagenomes in surface, deep chlorophyll maximum and mesopelagic samples across 6 size fractions (<0.2-2000 m). Imaging and PCR-free molecular data were remarkably congruent. Sequences from diazotrophs were detected from the ultrasmall bacterioplankton (<0.2 m) to mesoplankton (180-2000 m), while images predicted symbiotic and colonial-forming diazotrophs (>20 {micro}m). Imaging and molecular data estimated that polyploidy can significantly impact gene abundances of symbiotic vs colonial-forming diazotrophs. In general our results support the canonical view that larger sized diazotrophs (>10 m) dominate the tropical belts, while sequences from unicellular cyanobacterial and non-cyanobacterial diazotrophs were globally distributed in surface and the mesopelagic. Co-occurring diazotrophic lineages of different lifestyles were frequently encountered, and several new high density regions of diazotrophs were identified in the global ocean. Overall, this work provides an update of marine diazotroph biogeographical diversity and contributes a new bio-imaging-informatic workflow.",

    "abstract": "The bioenergetic function of mitochondrial fission is associated with uncoupled respiration or elimination of damaged mitochondria to maintain a healthy mitochondrial population. In the presence of a high abundance of exogenous fatty acids, cells can either store fatty acids in lipid droplets or oxidize them in mitochondria. Even though carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT1) controls the respiratory capacity of mitochondria in fatty acid oxidation, we observed that it did not dictate the balance of storage and usage of lipids in HeLa cells. On the other hand, inhibition of mitochondrial fission by silencing dynamic-related protein 1 (DRP1) resulted in an increase in fatty acid content of lipid droplets and a decrease in fatty acid oxidation. Mitochondrial fission was not only reflective of the amount of exogenous fatty acid being processed by mitochondria, but also found to be actively involved in the distribution of fatty acids between mitochondria and lipid droplets. Our data reveals a novel function for mitochondrial fission in balancing exogenous fatty acids between usage and storage, assigning a role for mitochondrial dynamics in control of intracellular fuel utilization and partitioning.",

    "abstract": "Dating the tree of life is central to understanding the evolution of life on Earth. Molecular clocks calibrated with fossils represent the state of the art for inferring the ages of major groups. Yet, other information on the timing of species diversification can be used to date the tree of life. For example, horizontal gene transfer events and ancient coevolutionary relationships such as (endo)symbioses can imply temporal relationships between two nodes in a phylogeny (Davin et al. 2018). These alternative sources of temporal constraints can be particularly helpful when the geological record is sparse, e.g. for microorganisms, which represent the vast majority of extant and extinct biodiversity.\n\nHere, we present a new method to combine fossil calibrations and relative age constraints to estimate chronograms. We provide an implementation of relative age constraints in RevBayes (Hohna et al. 2016) that can be combined in a modular manner with the wide range of molecular dating methods available in the software.\n\nWe use both realistic simulations and empirical datasets of 40 Cyanobacteria and 62 Archaea to evaluate our method. We show that the combination of relative age constraints with fossil calibrations significantly improves the estimation of node ages.",

To address this, we undertook multi-omic data profiling of chromatin and expression dynamics across epidermal differentiation to identify 40,103 dynamic CREs associated with 3,609 dynamically expressed genes, then applied an interpretable deep learning framework to model the cis-regulatory logic of chromatin accessibility. This identified cooperative DNA sequence rules in dynamic CREs regulating synchronous gene modules with diverse roles in skin differentiation. Massively parallel reporter analysis validated temporal dynamics and cooperative cis-regulatory logic. Variants linked to human polygenic skin disease were enriched in these time-dependent combinatorial motif rules.

    "abstract": "The relationship between alcohol consumption, circulating proteins, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk has not been well studied. We performed association analyses of alcohol consumption with three CVD risk factors and 71 CVD-related circulating proteins measured in 6,745 Framingham Heart Study participants (mean age, 49 years; 53% women). We found that an increase in alcohol consumption was associated with a higher risk of incident hypertension (P=7.2E-3) but a lower risk of incident obesity (P=5.7E-4) and type 2 diabetes (P=1.4E-5) in a 14-year of follow-up. Using independent discovery (n=4,348) and validation (n=2,397) samples, we identified 20 alcohol-associated proteins (FDR<0.05 in discovery and P<0.05/n in validation), with majority (18 of 20 proteins) inversely associated with alcohol consumption. The alcohol-protein associations remained similar after removing heavy drinkers. Four proteins demonstrated consistent triangular relationships, as expected, with alcohol consumption and CVD risk factors. For example, a greater level of APOA1, which was associated with a higher alcohol consumption (P=1.2E-65), was associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes (P=3.1E-5). However, several others showed inconsistent triangular relationships, e.g., a greater level of GDF15, which was associated with a lower alcohol consumption (P=1.0E-13), was associated with an increased risk of hypertension (P=2.4E-4). In conclusion, we identified 20 alcohol-associated proteins and demonstrated complex relationships between alcohol consumption, circulating proteins and CVD risk factors. Future studies with integration of more proteomic markers and larger sample size are warranted to unravel the complex relationship between alcohol consumption and CVD risk.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide protein-protein interaction (PPI) determination remains a significant unsolved problem in structural biology. The difficulty is twofold since high-throughput experiments (HTEs) have often a high false-positive rate in assigning PPIs, and PPI quaternary structures are more difficult to solve than tertiary structures using traditional structural biology techniques. We proposed a uniform pipeline to address both problems, which first recognizes PPIs by combining multi-chain threading alignments with HTE results using naive Bayesian classifiers, where the quaternary complex structures are then constructed by mapping the monomer models with the dimeric threading frameworks through interface-specific structural alignments. The pipeline was applied to the Escherichia coli genome and created 35,125 confident PPIs which is 4.5-fold higher than HTE alone. Graphic analyses of the PPI networks revealed a scale-free cluster size distribution, which was found critical to the robustness of genome evolution and the centrality of functionally important proteins that are essential to E. coli survival. Furthermore, complex structure models were constructed for all predicted E. coli PPIs based on the quaternary threading alignments, where 6,771 of them were found to have a high confidence score that corresponds to the correct fold of the complexes with a TM-score >0.5 and 93 showed a close consistency with the later released experimental structures with an average TM-score=0.73. These results demonstrated the significant usefulness of threading-based homologous modeling in both genome-wide PPI network detection and complex structural construction.",

However, systematic analysis of ferroptosis related genes (FRGs) in prostate cancer (PCa) remains to be clarified. In our research, we collected the mRNA expression profiles and clinical information of PCa patients from TCGA and MSKCC databases. The univariate, LASSO and multivariate Cox regression method were performed to construct prognostic signature in TCGA cohort. Seven FRGs, AKR1C3, ALOXE3, ATP5MC3, CARS1, MT1G, PTGS2, TFRC, were included to establish the risk model, which was validated in MSKCC dataset. Subsequently, we found that high risk group was strongly correlated with copy number alteration load, tumor burden mutation, immune cell infiltration, mRNAsi, immuetherapy and bicalutamide response. Finally, it was identified that overexpression of TFRC could induce proliferation and invasion in PCa cell lines in vitro. These results demonstrated that this risk model based on recurrence free survival (RFS) could accurately predict prognosis in PCa patients, suggesting that FRGs are promising prognostic biomarkers and drug target genes for PCa patients.",

In this study, we performed genome-wide MYB-domain screening and identified a total of 997 MYBs in wheat (Triticum aestivum), among which 445 were 2-domain MYBs (R2R3-MYBs) that were clustered into 15 subgroups with varied conservation profiles. Homologous genes were highly conserved across the three subgenomes, with minor variations contributed by segmental duplications. Tandem and proximal gene duplications have contributed significantly to the expansion of the wheat Myb gene family. Furthermore, comprehensive transcriptome profiling of R2R3-Myb genes in 61 different tissue and time point samples revealed a clear pattern of temporal and spatial variations within six expression groups. The comprehensive genomic and transcriptional analyses provided valuable insights into the evolution and biological functions of R2R3-Myb genes in wheat. They would serve as a useful guide to further investigate the potential agronomic traits controlled by this large TF family.",

    "abstract": "1.BackgroundThe mothers of owl monkeys sometimes reject their new-borns. When this occurs in captive colonies, the rejected infants are manually raised by veterinarians, allowing them to survive. However, maternal rejection can induce chronic stress, which in turn is associated with infectious diseases. Rescued, rejected owl monkeys might experience high rates of stress and infections which go undetected.\n\nMethodologyTo test this hypothesis, we evaluated the connection between maternal rejection, stress and infections in owl monkeys (Aotus nancymaae) from the IVITA Center for Conservation and Reproduction of Primates (UNMSM, Peru). Specifically, we compared the stress rates and frequency of infection treatment in juveniles (19-24 months) rejected in the first month of life and controls. To assess stress, we compared cortisol levels in hair using a competitive ELISA and recorded behaviours using cameras. We analysed past medical treatments and medication to compare incidence of infection treatment in subjects. We then studied the correlation between the frequency of infection treatments and cortisol using a linear regression.\n\nResultsRejected owl monkeys showed significantly higher cortisol levels (p=0.0123), a higher incidence of stereotypical behaviour and overeating (pacing p=0.0159; head twirling p=0.0476, eating p=0.0238) compared to controls. Rejected owl monkeys also received significantly more treatment for infections than controls per month lived (p=0.0009). Moreover, infection rates observed in this population were positively although weakly associated with concentration of cortisol in hair (R2=0.307, p=0.0075).\n\nConclusionMaternal rejection in the first month of life is associated with high and long-lasting stress levels and infections in the IVITA owl monkey colony. IVITA owl monkeys will be a useful model for studying the long-term effects of early life stress at the population level.",

    "abstract": "To initiate biofilm formation it is critical for bacteria to sense a surface and respond precisely. Type 4 pili (T4P) have been shown to be important in surface sensing, however, mechanism(s) driving downstream changes important for the switch to biofilm growth have not been clearly defined. Here, using macroscopic bulk assays and single cell tracking analyses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we uncover a new role of the T4P alignment complex protein, PilO, in modulating the activity of the diguanylate cyclase (DGC) SadC. Two hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays show that PilO physically interacts with SadC and that the PilO-SadC interaction inhibits SadCs activity resulting in decreased biofilm formation and increased motility. We show that disrupting the PilO-SadC interaction contributes to greater variation of cyclic-di-GMP levels among cells, thereby increasing cell-to-cell heterogeneity in the levels of this signal. Thus, this work shows that P. aeruginosa uses a component of the T4P scaffold to fine-tune the levels of this nucleotide signal during surface commitment. Finally, given our previous findings linking SadC to the flagellar machinery, we propose that this DGC acts as a bridge to integrate T4P and flagellar-derived input signals during initial surface engagement.\n\nSignificance StatementT4P of P. aeruginosa are important for surface sensing and regulating intracellular cyclic-di-GMP levels. This work identifies a new role for the T4P alignment complex, previously known for its role in supporting pili biogenesis, in surface-dependent signaling. Furthermore, our findings indicate that P. aeruginosa uses a single DGC, via a complex web of protein-protein interactions, to integrate signaling through the T4P and the flagellar motor to fine-tune cyclic-di-GMP levels. A key implication of this work is that more than just regulating signal levels, cells must modulate the dynamic range of cyclic-di-GMP to precisely control the transition to a biofilm lifestyle.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRecent reports have established the emergence and dissemination of extensively drug resistant (XDR) H58 Salmonella Typhi clone in Pakistan. In India where typhoid fever is endemic, only sporadic cases of ceftriaxone resistant S. Typhi are reported. This study aimed at elucidating the phylogenetic evolutionary framework of ceftriaxone resistant S. Typhi isolates from India to predict their potential dissemination in endemic regions.\n\nMethodsFive ceftriaxone resistant S. Typhi isolates from three tertiary care hospitals in India were sequenced on an Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM). A core genome single-nucleotide-polymorphism (SNP) based phylogeny of the isolates in comparison to the global collection of MDR and XDR S. Typhi isolates was built. Two of five isolates were additionally sequenced using Oxford Nanopore MinION to completely characterize the plasmid and understand its transmission dynamics within Enterobacteriaceae.\n\nResultsComparative genomic analysis and detailed plasmid characterization indicate that while in Pakistan (4.3.1 lineage I) the XDR trait is associated with blaCTX-M-15 gene on IncY plasmid, in India (4.3.1 lineage II), the ceftriaxone resistance is due to short term adaptation of resistance plasmids such as IncX3 or IncN.\n\nConclusionSince the bacterial acquisition of smaller resistance plasmids such as IncX3 or IncN from other Enterobacteriaceae can be much faster than the larger IncY plasmids, the rapid expansion of these genotypically novel XDR S. Typhi could potentially cause large outbreaks. Therefore, continuous monitoring of S. Typhi lineages carrying cephalosporin resistance on IncX3 or IncN plasmids is vital not just for India but globally.\n\nImportanceGenomic analysis of cephalosporin resistant S. Typhi isolated from India indicates the potential of S. Typhi to develop cephalosporin resistance by acquiring diverse plasmids from other Enterobacteriaceae. We identified the occurrence of independent acquisition of drug-resistant plasmids such as IncX3 and IncN with genes encoding beta-lactamases in H58/4.3.1.2 lineage. A short term adaptation of drug-resistant plasmids in H58/4.3.1.2 lineage can be the reason for the sporadic cases cephalosporin resistant S. Typhi in India. However, the IncY plasmid acquired by isolates that belong to H58/4.3.1.1 lineage appeared to be well adapted as observed in XDR S. Typhi outbreak in Pakistan. Plasmid acquisition and maintenance of cephalosporin resistant S. Typhi appears to be specific to the phylogenetic lineage as lineages differ in compensating the initial cost imposed by the plasmid. The stable maintenance of these resistance plasmids without a fitness cost, are determinant in understanding the future spread of cephalosporin resistance in S. Typhi. Therefore, critical strategies in monitoring and control of cephalosporin resistant S. Typhi is needed to tackle further public health crisis.",
