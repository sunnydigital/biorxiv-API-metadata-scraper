    "abstract": "One of the key challenges in single-cell data analysis is the annotation of cells with their cell types. This task is divided into two different sub-tasks: identifying known cell types and identifying novel cell types. In the former case, we can benefit from being able to transfer annotations from bulk RNA-seq because there are many more types profiled with that more established technology. In the latter case, we would benefit from interpretable models that can describe the reasons for grouping a number of cells together. We propose that both of these problems can be solved by generative Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial models. In the supervised learning context, we propose a generative Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial classifier. We show that such a classifier can effectively transfer cell labels from bulk to single-cell RNA-sequencing data. We also show that alternative well-established machine learning models have difficulty with this transition, even if they are effective within the same regime (i.e. single cell to single cell). In the unsupervised learning context, we propose a Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial mixture model. We show that the proposed model learns meaningful clusters where the automatically learned relationships between cell types and genes overlap with ground truth associations. Furthermore, there are no density or connectivity based clustering assumptions in this model, which differs with almost every approach in this field. Consequently the clustering results from the generative method can effectively represent nuanced differences among cells.\n\nContactmurat.cobanoglu@utsouthwestern.edu",

    "abstract": "To address the need for improved tools for annotation and comparative genomics of bacteriophage genomes, we developed multiPhATE2. As an extension of the multiPhATE code, multiPhATE2 performs gene finding and functional sequence annotation of predicted gene and protein sequences, and additional search algorithms and databases extend the search space of the original functional annotation subsystem. MultiPhATE2 includes comparative genomics codes for gene matching among sets of input bacteriophage genomes, and scales well to large input data sets with the incorporation of multiprocessing in the functional annotation and comparative genomics subsystems.

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA-seq is a powerful tool in the study of the cellular composition of different tissues and organisms. A key step in the analysis pipeline is the annotation of cell-types based on the expression of specific marker genes. Since manual annotation is labor-intensive and does not scale to large datasets, several methods for automated cell-type annotation have been proposed based on supervised learning. However, these methods generally require feature extraction and batch alignment prior to classification, and their performance may become unreliable in the presence of cell-types with very similar transcriptomic profiles, such as differentiating cells. We propose JIND, a framework for automated cell-type identification based on neural networks that directly learns a low-dimensional representation (latent code) in which cell-types can be reliably determined. To account for batch effects, JIND performs a novel asymmetric alignment in which the transcriptomic profile of unseen cells is mapped onto the previously learned latent space, hence avoiding the need of retraining the model whenever a new dataset becomes available. JIND also learns cell-type-specific confidence thresholds to identify and reject cells that cannot be reliably classified. We show on datasets with and without batch effects that JIND classifies cells more accurately than previously proposed methods while rejecting only a small proportion of cells. Moreover, JIND batch alignment is parallelizable, being more than five or six times faster than Seurat integration. Availability: https://github.com/mohit1997/JIND.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSome degree of weight regain is typically observed in human patients who undergo Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG), even if the majority of them do not return to their presurgical body weight. Although the majority of bariatric surgery patients are middle aged, most preclinical models of bariatric surgery utilize juvenile male mice. A long-term characterization of the response of mature, wild type, obese male mice to SG has not been performed.\n\nMethodsEight-month old C57bl/6J obese male mice were randomized to undergo SG, sham surgery without caloric restriction (SH) or sham surgery with caloric restriction to match body weight to the SG group (SWM). Body weight, body composition and glucose tolerance were matched at baseline. Mice were followed for 60 days following their respective surgeries.\n\nResultsSG mice had a more pronounced percent weight loss than the SH group in the first post-operative month (p<0.05), along with fat mass loss (p<0.01). By the second post-operative month, the SG group started to regain fat mass, although it continued to be statistically lower than the SH group (p<0.05). Cumulative food intake was significantly lower in the SG group compared to SH group only in the first post-operative week (p<0.05), with both groups having similar cumulative food intake thereafter (p>0.05). SWM group had a significantly lower cumulative food intake throughout the study, except for week 1 (p<0.01). Glucose tolerance was only demonstrably better in the SG group compared to SH group at 8 weeks post-operatively (p<0.01). Plasma leptin was significantly lower in the SG group compared to both SWM and SH groups group by the second post-operative month (p<0.01), in spite of SGs increasing fat mass accumulation. In the second post-operative month, both FGF-21 and GDF-15 were increased in the SH group compared to the SG and SWM groups (p<0.05), while there was no difference in plasma insulin among the three groups. Heat production was surprisingly higher in the SH group compared to the other two groups (p<0.05), even though brown adipose tissue Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma (PPARg) and Cidea mRNA expression were significantly higher in SG and SWM compared to SH (p<0.01). There was no change in BAT UCP-1 mRNA expression among the groups (p>0.05). There was also no change in fecal lipid content among the groups (p>0.05).\n\nConclusionsSG in obese, middle aged male mice leads is accompanied by fat mass regain in the second post-operative month, while plasma leptin levels continue to be significantly lower. This raises the question of whether the observed fat mass regain consists mostly of visceral adipose tissue.",

    "abstract": "Some neural responses are classified by the stimulus conditions leading up to that response while other neural responses are also classified by the morphology of the responses themselves. However, morphology-based classification may not be appropriate if one can nudge a neural response into looking like another neural response. Morphology-based classification occurs with the N170 and RP (Recognition Potential), ERP components that are studied in separate literatures and yet share much in common in terms of functionality. In this study, we demonstrate a gradual transformation in the morphology of the N170 to the RP using a simple parametric manipulation of forward masks that is unlikely to cause a change in the underlying processing. Both the N170 and RP are N1 components, meaning that they are the first negative deflection of the evoked response. However, the RP is often measured with a forward mask that ends at stimulus onset whereas the N170 is often measured with no masking at all. This study investigates how ISI may delay and distort the N170 into an RP by manipulating the temporal gap (ISI) between forward mask and target. The results revealed reverse relationships between the ISI on the one hand, and the N170 latency, single-trial N1 jitter (an approximation of N1 width) and reaction time on the other hand. Importantly, we find that scalp topographies have a unique signature at the N1 peak across all conditions, from the longest gap (N170) to the shortest (RP). These findings prove that the mask-delayed N1 is still the same N170, even under conditions that are normally associated with a different component like the RP. In general, our results suggest that greater caution should be taken to interpret the time course of a measured effect when forward masks are employed.",

    "abstract": "Dionysia tapetodes, a small cushion-forming mountainous evergreen in the Primulaceae, possesses a vast surface-covering of long silky fibres forming the characteristic \"wooly\" farina. This contrasts with some related Primula which instead possess a powdery farina. Using a combination of cell biology and analytical chemical techniques, we provide a detailed insight of wooly farina formation by glandular trichomes that produce a mixture of flavone and substituted flavone derivatives, including hydroxyflavones. Conversely, our analysis show that the powdery form consist almost entirely of flavone. The wooly farina in D. tapetodes is extruded through specific sites at the surface of the glandular head cell, characterised by a small complete gap in the plasma membrane, cell wall and cuticle. The data is consistent with formation and thread elongation occurring from within the cell. The putative mechanism of wool thread formation and its stability is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Arabidopsis Clade 3 GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-LIKE (GLRs) genes are primary players in wound-induced electrical signaling and jasmonate-activated defense responses. As cation-permeable ion channels, previous studies have focused on resolving their gating properties and structures. However, little is known regarding to the regulatory mechanism of these channel proteins. Here, we report that the C-tail of GLR3.3 contains key elements that control its function in long distance wound signaling. GLR3.3 without its C-tail failed to rescue the glr3.3a mutant. To further investigate the underlying mechanism, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen. IMPAIRED SUCROSE INDUCTION 1 (ISI1) was identified as an interactor with both the C-tail and the full-length GLR3.3 in planta. Reduced function isi1 mutants had enhanced electrical activity and jasmonate-regulated defense responses. Furthermore, we found that a triresidue motif RFL (R884, F885 and L886) in the GLR3.3 C-tail is essential for interacting with ISI1. RFL mutation abolished GLR3.3 function in electrical signaling and jasmonate-mediated defense gene activation. Our study shows the importance of the C-tail in GLR3.3 function, and reveals parallels with the ipnotropic glutamate receptor regulation in animal cells.",

    "abstract": "Understanding photosynthetic light harvesting requires knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that dissipate excess energy in thylakoids. However, it remains unclear how the physical environment of light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) influences the process of chlorophyll de-excitation. Here, we demonstrate that protein-protein interactions between LHCIIs affect the optical properties of LHCII and thus influence the total energy budget. Aggregation of LHCII in the dark altered its absorption properties, independent of the amount of prior light exposure. We also revisited the triplet excited state involved in light-induced fluorescence quenching and found another relaxation pathway involving emission in the green region, which might be related to triplet excited energy transfer to neighboring carotenoids and annihilation processes that result in photoluminescence. LHCII- containing liposomes with different protein densities exhibited altered fluorescence and scattering properties. Our results suggest that macromolecular reorganization affects overall optical properties, which need to be addressed to compare the level of energy dissipation.",

    "abstract": "Recent experiments have uncovered a fundamental information scale for cellular signaling networks: the correlation between input and output concentrations of molecules in a signaling pathway corresponds to at most 1-3 bits of mutual information. Our understanding of the physical constraints and evolutionary pressures that determine this scale remains incomplete. By focusing on a basic element of signaling pathways, the kinase-phosphatase enzymatic push-pull loop, we highlight the pivotal role played by energy resources available for signaling and their expenditure: the chemical potential energy of ATP hydrolysis, and the rate of ATP consumption. Scanning a broad range of reaction parameters based on enzymatic databases, we find that ATP chemical potentials in modern organisms are just above the threshold necessary to achieve empirical mutual information values. We also derive an analytical relation for the minimum ATP consumption required to maintain a certain signal fidelity across a range of input frequencies, where we quantify fidelity either through instantaneous or time-delayed mutual information. Attempting to increase signal fidelity beyond a few bits lowers the bandwidth, the maximum characteristic signal frequency that the network can handle at a given energy cost. The observed information scale thus represents a balancing act between fidelity and the ability to process fast-changing environmental signals. Our analytical relation defines a performance limit for kinase-phosphatase networks, and we find evidence that a component of the yeast osmotic shock pathway may be close to the optimality line. By quantifying the evolutionary pressures that operate on these networks, we argue that this is not a coincidence: natural selection on energy expenditures is capable of pushing signaling systems toward optimality, particularly in unicellular organisms. Our theoretical framework is directly verifiable using existing experimental techniques, and predicts that more examples of such optimality should exist in nature.",

    "abstract": "The auditory steady-state response (ASSR) is an oscillatory brain response generated by periodic auditory stimuli and originates mainly from the temporal auditory cortices. Recent data show that while the auditory cortices are indeed strongly activated by the stimulus when it is present (ON ASSR), the anatomical distribution of ASSR sources involves also parietal and frontal cortices, indicating that the ASSR is a more complex phenomenon than previously believed. Furthermore, while the ASSR typically continues to oscillate even after the stimulus has stopped (OFF ASSR), very little is known about the characteristics of the OFF ASSR and how it compares to the ON ASSR. Here, we assessed whether the OFF and ON ASSR powers are modulated by the stimulus properties (i.e. volume and pitch), selective attention, as well as individual musical sophistication. We also investigated the cortical source distribution of the OFF ASSR using a melody tracking task, in which attention was directed between uniquely amplitude-modulated melody streams that differed in pitch. The ON and OFF ASSRs were recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG) on a group of participants varying from low to high degree of musical sophistication. Our results show that the OFF ASSR is distinctly different from the ON ASSR in nearly every aspect. While the ON ASSR was modulated by the stimulus properties and selective attention, the OFF ASSR was not influenced by any of these factors. Furthermore, while the ON ASSR was generated primarily from temporal sources, the OFF ASSR originated mainly from the frontal cortex. These findings challenge the notion that the OFF ASSR is merely a continuation of the ON ASSR. Rather, they suggest that the OFF ASSR is an internally-driven signal that develops from an initial sensory processing state (ON ASSR), with both types of ASSRs clearly differing in cortical representation and character. Furthermore, our results show that the ON ASSR power was enhanced by selective attention at cortical sources within each of the bilateral frontal, temporal, parietal and insular lobes. Finally, the ON ASSR proved sensitive to musicality, demonstrating positive correlations between musical sophistication and ASSR power, as well as with the degree of attentional ASSR modulation at the left and right parietal cortices. Taken together, these results show new aspects of the ASSR response, and demonstrate its usefulness as an effective tool for analysing how selective attention interacts with individual abilities in music perception.",

    "abstract": "A network of myenteric interstitial cells of Cajal in the corpus of the stomach serves as its \"pacemaker\", continuously generating a ca. 0.05 Hz electrical slow wave, which is transmitted to the brain chiefly by vagal afferents. A recent study combining resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) with concurrent surface electrogastrography (EGG), with cutaneous electrodes placed on the epigastrium, found 12 brain regions with activity that was significantly phase-locked with this gastric basal electrical rhythm. Therefore, we asked whether fluctuations in brain resting state networks (RSNs), estimated using a spatial independent component analysis (ICA) approach, might be synchronized with the stomach. In the present study, in order to determine whether any RSNs are phase-locked with the gastric rhythm, an individual participant underwent 22 scanning sessions; in each, two 15-minute runs of concurrent EGG and rsfMRI data were acquired. EGG data from three sessions had weak gastric signals and were excluded; the other 19 sessions yielded a total of 9.5 hours of data. The rsfMRI data were analyzed using group ICA; RSN time courses were estimated using dual regression; for each run, the phase-locking value (PLV) was computed between each RSN and the gastric signal. To assess statistical significance, PLVs from all pairs of \"mismatched\" data (EGG and rsfMRI data acquired on different days) were used as surrogate data to generate a null distribution for each RSN. Of a total of 18 RSNs, three were found to be significantly phase-locked with the basal gastric rhythm, namely, a cerebellar network, a dorsal somatosensory-motor network, and a default mode network. Disruptions to the gut-brain axis, which sustains interoceptive feedback between the central nervous system and the viscera, are thought to be involved in various disorders; manifestation of the infra-slow rhythm of the stomach in brain rsfMRI data could be useful for studies in clinical populations.",

    "abstract": "Bayesian models successfully account for several of dopamine (DA)s effects on contextual calibration in interval timing and reward estimation. In these models, tonic levels of DA control the precision of stimulus encoding, which is weighed against contextual information when making decisions. When DA levels are high, the animal relies more heavily on the (highly precise) stimulus encoding, whereas when DA levels are low, the context affects decisions more strongly. Here, we extend this idea to intertemporal choice and probability discounting tasks. In intertemporal choice tasks, agents must choose between a small reward delivered soon and a large reward delivered later, whereas in probability discounting tasks, agents must choose between a small reward that is always delivered and a large reward that may be omitted with some probability. Beginning with the principle that animals will seek to maximize their reward rates, we show that the Bayesian model predicts a number of curious empirical findings in both tasks. First, the model predicts that higher DA levels should normally promote selection of the larger/later option, which is often taken to imply that DA decreases  impulsivity, and promote selection of the large/risky option, often taken to imply that DA increases  risk-seeking. However, if the temporal precision is sufficiently decreased, higher DA levels should have the opposite effect--promoting selection of the smaller/sooner option (higher impulsivity) and the small/safe option (lower risk-seeking). Second, high enough levels of DA can result in preference reversals. Third, selectively decreasing the temporal precision, without manipulating DA, should promote selection of the larger/later and large/risky options. Fourth, when a different post-reward delay is associated with each option, animals will not learn the option-delay contingencies, but this learning can be salvaged when the post-reward delays are made more salient. Finally, the Bayesian model predicts correlations among behavioral phenotypes: Animals that are better timers will also appear less impulsive.",

    "abstract": "Synchronization is a fundamental property of biological neural networks, playing a mechanistic role in both healthy and disease brain states. The medullary pacemaker nucleus of the weakly electric fish is a synchronized network of high-frequency neurons, weakly coupled via gap junctions. Synchrony in the pacemaker is behaviourally modulated on millisecond timescales, but how gap junctional connectivity enables such rapid resynchronization speeds is poorly understood. Here, we use a computational model of the pacemaker, along with graph theory and predictive analyses, to investigate how network properties, such as randomness and the directionality of coupling (bidirectional/non-rectifying versus directional/rectifying gap junctions) characterize the fast synchronization of the pacemaker network. Our results provide predictions about connectivity in the pacemaker and insight into the relationship between structural network properties and synchronization dynamics in neural systems more generally.",

Retinal ganglion cell axon degeneration occurs in a number of blinding diseases and the ability to stimulate axon regeneration from surviving ganglion cells could provide the anatomic substrate for restoration of vision. OTX2 is a homeoprotein transcription factor expressed in the retina and previous studies showed that, in response to stress, exogenous OTX2 increases the in vitro and in vivo survival of retinal ganglion cells. The present results show that, in addition to promoting adult retinal ganglion cell survival, OTX2 also stimulates the regeneration of their axons in vitro and in vivo. This dual activity of OTX2 on retinal ganglion cell survival and regeneration is of potential interest for degenerative diseases affecting this cell type.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of germ layers in embryos during gastrulation is a key developmental milestone. How morphogenetic signals engage the regulatory networks responsible for early embryonic tissue patterning is incompletely understood. To understand this, we developed a gene regulatory network (GRN) model of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) lineage commitment and embedded it into  cellular agents that respond to a dynamic signalling microenvironment. We found that cellular pattern order, composition, and dynamics were predictably manipulable based on the GRN wiring. We showed that feedback between OCT4, and BMP and WNT pathways created a dynamic OCT4 front that mediates the spatiotemporal evolution of developmental patterns. Translocation of this radial front can be predictively disrupted in vitro to control germ-layer pattern composition. This work links the emergence of multicellular patterns to regulatory network activity in individual hPSCs. We anticipate our approach will help to understand how GRN structure regulates organogenesis in different contexts.",

    "abstract": "Replacement of synthetic insecticides with transgenic crops for pest management has been both economically and environmentally beneficial. These benefits have often eroded as pests evolved resistance to transgenic crops, but a broad understanding of the timing and complexity of adaptive changes which lead to field-evolved resistance in pest species is lacking. Wild populations of Helicoverpa zea, a major lepidopteran crop pest and the target of transgenic Cry toxin-expressing cotton and corn, have recently evolved widespread, damaging levels of resistance. Here, we quantified patterns of genomic change in wild H. zea collected between 2002 and 2017 when adoption rates of Cry-expressing crops expanded in North America. Using a combination of genomic approaches, we identified significant temporal changes in allele frequency throughout the genomes of field-collected H. zea. Many of these changes occurred concurrently with increasingly damaging levels of resistance to Cry toxins between 2012 and 2016, in a pattern consistent with polygenic selection. Surprisingly, none of the eleven previously described Cry resistance genes showed signatures of selection in wild H. zea. Furthermore, we observed evidence of a very strong selective sweep in one region of the H. zea genome, yet this strongest change was not additively associated with Cry resistance. This first, whole genome analysis of field-collected specimens to study evolution of Cry resistance demonstrates the potential and need for a more holistic approach to examining pest adaptation to changing agricultural practices.\n\nSignificance StatementEvolution of pest resistance to management approaches in agricultural landscapes is common and results in economic losses. Early detection of pest resistance evolution prior to significant crop damage would benefit the agricultural community. It has been hypothesized that new genomic approaches could track molecular signals of emerging resistance problems and trigger efforts to pre-empt widespread damage. We tested this hypothesis by quantifying genomic changes in the pest Helicoverpa zea over a 15 year period concurrent with commercialization and subsequent loss of efficacy of transgenic Bt-expressing crops. Our results demonstrate the complex nature of evolution in agricultural ecosystems and provide insight into the potential for and pitfalls associated with use of genomic approaches for resistance monitoring. We discuss approaches for improvement.",

Here, we report that SHP2 is an essential promoter of endothelial cell survival and growth in the remodeling tumor vasculature. Using genetic and chemical approaches to inhibit SHP2 activity in endothelial cells, we show that SHP2 inhibits pro-apoptotic STAT3 and stimulates proliferative ERK1/2 signaling. Systemic SHP2 inhibition in mice bearing tumors selected for SHP2-independent tumor-cell growth, promotes degeneration of the tumor vasculature and blood extravasation; reduces tumor vascularity and blood perfusion; and increases tumor hypoxia and necrosis. Reduction of tumor growth ensues, independent of SHP2 targeting in the tumor cells, blocking immune checkpoints or recruiting anti-tumor macrophages. We also show that inhibiting the Angiopoietin/TIE2/AKT cascade magnifies the vascular and anti-tumor effects of SHP2 inhibition by blocking tumor endothelial AKT signaling, not a target of SHP2. Since the SHP2 and Ang2/TIE2 pathways are active in vascular endothelial cells of human melanoma and colon carcinoma, SHP2 inhibitors alone or with Ang2/Tie2 inhibitors hold promise to effectively target the tumor endothelium.",

    "abstract": "This is the first revision in nearly 130 years of the African genus Pseudohydrosme, formerly considered endemic to Gabon. Sister to Anchomanes, Pseudohydrosme is distinct from Anchomanes because of its 2-3-locular ovary (not unilocular), peduncle concealed by cataphylls at anthesis and far shorter than the spathe (not exposed, far exceeding the spathe), stipitate fruits and viviparous (vegetatively apomictic) roots (not sessile, roots non-viviparous). Three species, one new to science, are recognised, in two sections. Although doubt has previously been cast on the value of recognising Pseudohydrosme buettneri, of Gabon, it is here accepted and maintained as a distinct species in the monotypic section, Zyganthera. However, it is considered to be probably globally extinct. Pseudohydrosme gabunensis, type species of the genus, also Gabonese, is maintained in Sect. Pseudohydrosme together with Pseudohydrosme ebo sp.nov. of the Ebo Forest, Littoral, Cameroon, the first addition to the genus since the nineteenth century, and which extends the range of the genus 450 km north from Gabon, into the Cross-Sanaga biogeographic area. The discovery of Pseudohydrosme ebo resulted from a series of surveys for conservation management in Cameroon, and triggered this paper. All three species of Pseudohydrosme are morphologically characterised, their habitat and biogeography discussed, and their extinction risks are respectively assessed as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct), Endangered and Critically Endangered using the IUCN standard. Clearance of forest habitat for logging, followed by agriculture or urbanisation are major threats. One of the species may occur in a formally protected areas and is also cultivated widely but infrequently in Europe and the USA for its spectacular inflorescences.",

    "abstract": "Previous research has stressed the importance of uncertainty for controlling the speed of learning, and of how such control depends on the learner inferring the noise properties of the environment, especially volatility: the speed of change. However, learning rates are jointly determined by the comparison between volatility and a second factor, moment-to-moment stochasticity. Yet much previous research has focused on simplified cases corresponding to estimation of either factor alone. Here, we introduce a new learning model, in which both factors are learned simultaneously from experience. By considering the full problem of joint estimation, we highlight a set of previously unappreciated issues, arising from the mutual interdependence of inference about volatility and stochasticity. This interdependence both complicates and enriches the interpretation of previous results, such as those thought to implicate volatility in psychiatric conditions. This provides a novel mechanism for understanding pathological learning in amygdala damage and anxiety disorders.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWDeep neural networks (DNN) have set new standards at predicting responses of neural populations to visual input. Most such DNNs consist of a convolutional network (core) shared across all neurons which learns a representation of neural computation in visual cortex and a neuron-specific readout that linearly combines the relevant features in this representation. The goal of this paper is to test whether such a representation is indeed generally characteristic for visual cortex, i.e. gener-alizes between animals of a species, and what factors contribute to obtaining such a generalizing core. To push all non-linear computations into the core where the generalizing cortical features should be learned, we devise a novel readout that reduces the number of parameters per neuron in the readout by up to two orders of magnitude compared to the previous state-of-the-art. It does so by taking advantage of retinotopy and learns a Gaussian distribution over the neurons receptive field po-sition. With this new readout we train our network on neural responses from mouse primary visual cortex (V1) and obtain a gain in performance of 7% compared to the previous state-of-the-art network. We then investigate whether the convolutional core indeed captures general cortical features by using the core in transfer learning to a different animal. When transferring a core trained on thousands of neurons from various animals and scans we exceed the performance of training directly on that animal by 12%, and outperform a commonly used VGG16 core pre-trained on imagenet by 33%. In addition, transfer learning with our data-driven core is more data-efficient than direct training, achieving the same performance with only 40% of the data. Our model with its novel readout thus sets a new state-of-the-art for neural response prediction in mouse visual cortex from natural images, generalizes between animals, and captures better characteristic cortical features than current task-driven pre-training approaches such as VGG16.",

Regression analysis supports relevance of such non-grain determinants in grain yield under every environment but magnitude of impact can vary. Collective contribution of non-grain parameters can be high in a production environment where growth condition is most favourable for wheat growth and every factor is important in such situations. They contribute less in the environments engrossed with abiotic stress and merely one or two factors can be earmarked for selection. Besides yield, this selection strategy can also enhance grain weight in certain environments. At a time when selection for grain attributes is not providing further push; it would be worth trying to explore these non-grain field indicators as selection strategy for further advancement in productivity and grain weight of bread wheat.",

Though the substrate targets of the viral nucleotidyl transferase are unknown, NiRAN active sites are highly conserved and essential for viral replication 3. We show, for the first time, the detection and sequence location of GMP-modified amino acids in nidovirus RdRP-associated proteins using heavy isotope-assisted MS and MS/MS peptide sequencing. We identified lys-143 in the equine arteritis virus (EAV) protein, nsp7, as a primary site of nucleotidylation in vitro that uses a phosphoramide bond to covalently attach with GMP. In SARS-CoV-2 replicase proteins, we demonstrate a unique O-linked GMP attachment on nsp7 ser-1, whose formation required the presence of nsp12. It is clear that additional nucleotidylation sites remain undiscovered, which includes the possibility that nsp12 itself may form a transient GMP adduct in the NiRAN active site that has eluted detection in these initial studies due to instability of the covalent attachment. Our results demonstrate new strategies for detecting GMP-peptide linkages that can be adapted for higher throughput screening using mass spectrometric technologies. These data are expected to be important for a rapid and timely characterization of a new enzymatic activity in SARS-CoV-2 that may be an attractive drug target aimed at limiting viral replication in infected patients.",

There is currently no biomarker or model for in utero microglial priming and function that might aid in identifying the neonates and children most vulnerable to neurodevelopmental morbidity, as microglia remain inaccessible in fetal life and after birth. This study aimed to generate patient-derived microglial-like cell models unique to each neonate from reprogrammed umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells, adapting and extending a novel methodology previously validated for adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We demonstrate that umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells can be used to create microglial-like cell models morphologically and functionally similar to microglia observed in vivo. We illustrate the application of this approach by generating microglia from cells exposed and unexposed to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our ability to create personalized neonatal models of fetal brain immune programming enables non-invasive insights into fetal brain development and potential childhood neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities for a range of maternal exposures, including COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Many plant pathogenic fungi contain conditionally dispensable (CD) chromosomes that are associated with virulence, but not growth in vitro. Virulence-associated CD chromosomes carry genes encoding effectors and/or host-specific toxin biosynthesis enzymes that may contribute significantly to determining host specificity. Fusarium oxysporum causes devastating diseases of more than 100 plant species. Among a large number of host-specific forms, F. oxysporum f. sp. conglutinans (Focn) can infect Brassicaceae plants including Arabidopsis and cabbage. Here we show that Focn has multiple CD chromosomes involved in virulence but also in vegetative growth, which is an atypical feature of CD chromosomes. We identified specific CD chromosomes that are required for virulence on Arabidopsis, cabbage, or both, and describe a pair of effectors encoded on one of the CD chromosomes that is required for suppression of Arabidopsis-specific phytoalexin-based immunity. The effector pair is highly conserved in F. oxysporum isolates capable of infecting Arabidopsis, but not of other plants. This study provides insight into how host specificity of F. oxysporum may be determined by a pair of effector genes on a transmissible CD chromosome.",

    "abstract": "Mannose-oligosaccharide (MOS) pre-biotics are widely deployed in animal agriculture as immunomodulators as well as to enhance growth and gut health. Their mode of action is thought to be mediated through their impact on host microbial communities and associated metabolism. Bio-MOS is a commercially available pre-biotic currently used in the agri-feed industry. To assay Bio-MOS for potential use as a pre-biotic growth promotor in salmonid aquaculture, we modified an established Atlantic salmon in vitro gut model, SalmoSim, to evaluate its impact on host microbial communities. In biological triplicate, microbial communities were stabilised in SalmoSim followed by twenty-day exposure to the pre-biotic and then an eight day  wash out period. Exposure the MOS resulted in a significant increase in formate (p=0.001), propionate (p=0.037) and isovalerate (p=0.024) levels, correlated with increased abundances of several principally anaerobic microbial genera (Fusobacteria, Agarivorans, Pseudoalteromonas, Myroides). 16S rDNA sequencing confirmed a significant shift in microbial community composition in response to supplementation. In conjunction with previous in vivo studies linking enhanced VFA production alongside MOS supplementation to host growth and performance, our data suggest that Bio-MOS may be of value in salmonid production. Furthermore, our data highlight the potential role of in vitro gut models to augment in vivo trials of microbiome modulators.",

    "abstract": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a dsDNA virus and its high-risk subtypes increase cancer risks. Yet, the mechanism of HPV infection and pathogenesis still remain unclear. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms, and the pathogenesis of HPV are crucial in the prevention of HPV related cancers. In this study, we analyzed cervix squamous cell carcinoma (CESC) and head and neck carcinoma (HNSC) combined data to investigate various HPV induced cancer common feature. We showed that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was downregulated in HPV positive (HPV+) cancer, and that HPV+ cancer patients exhibited better prognosis than HPV negative (HPV-) cancer patients. Our study also showed that TP53 mutation rate is lower in HPV+ cancer than in HPV- cancer and that TP53 can be modulated by HPV E7 protein. However, there was no significant difference in the expression of wildtype TP53 in both groups. Subsequently, we constructed HPV-human interaction network and found that EGFR is a critical factor. From the network, we also noticed that EGFR is regulated by HPV E7 protein and hsa-miR-944. Moreover, while phosphorylated EGFR is associated with a worse prognosis, EGFR total express level is not significantly correlated with prognosis. This indicates that EGFR activation will induce a worse outcome in HPV+ cancer patients. Further enrichment analysis showed that EGFR downstream pathway and cancer relative pathway are diversely activated in HPV+ cancer and HPV- cancer. In summary, HPV E7 protein downregulates EGFR that downregulates phosphorylated EGFR and inhibit EGFR related pathways which in turn and consequently induce better prognosis.\n\nImportanceAlthough HPV infection has been studied in various cancer types, there are only limited studies that have focused on the common effect of HPV related cancer. Consequently, this study focused on CESC and HNSC, two cancer types with high HPV infection proportion in cohort, thereby, intending to dig out the common effects and mechanisms of HPV+ cancers.\n\nUnlike some virus-human interaction prediction studies, the P-HIPSter database provides virus-human protein interaction based on protein structure prediction. Through this data, our interaction network was able to uncover previously unnoticed protein interactions. Our finding revealed that HPV infection caused various gene expression differences, and a great amount of which interact with EGFR, a cancer related gene. Therefore, since EGFR is associated with HPV+ cancer patients survival, some FDA proved EGFR inhibitors would be potential anti-HPV drugs.",

Until recently, this virus was the sole member of the Amnoonviridae, a family within the order Articulavirales comprising segmented negative-sense RNA viruses. We sought to identify additional viruses within the Amnoonviridae through total RNA sequencing (meta-transcriptomics) and data mining of published transcriptomes. Accordingly, we sampled marine fish species from both Australia and China and discovered two new viruses within the Amnoonviridae, tentatively called Flavolineata virus and Piscibus virus, respectively. In addition, by mining vertebrate transcriptome data we identified nine additional virus transcripts matching to multiple genomic segments of TiLV in both marine and freshwater fish. These new viruses retained sequence conservation with the distantly related Orthomyxoviridae in the RdRp subunit PB1, but formed a distinct and diverse phylogenetic group. These data suggest that the Amnoonviridae have a broad host range within fish and that greater animal sampling will identify additional divergent members of the Articulavirales.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDouble-stranded DNA bacteriophages (dsDNA phages) play pivotal roles in structuring human gut microbiomes; yet, the gut phageome is far from being fully characterized, and additional groups of phages, including highly abundant ones, continue to be discovered by metagenome mining. A multilevel framework for taxonomic classification of viruses was recently adopted, facilitating the classification of phages into evolutionary informative taxonomic units based on hallmark genes. Together with advanced approaches for sequence assembly and powerful methods of sequence analysis, this revised framework offers the opportunity to discover and classify unknown phage taxa in the human gut.\n\nResultsA search of human gut metagenomes for circular contigs encoding phage hallmark genes resulted in the identification of 3,738 apparently complete phage genomes that represent 451 putative genera. Several of these phage genera are only distantly related to previously identified phages and are likely to found new families. Two of the candidate families, \"Flandersviridae\" and \"Quimbyviridae\", include some of the most common and abundant members of the human gut virome that infect Bacteroides, Parabacteroides and Prevotella. The third proposed family, \"Gratiaviridae\", consists of less abundant phages that are distantly related to the families Autographiviridae, Drexlerviridae and Chaseviridae. Analysis of CRISPR spacers indicates that phages of all three putative families infect bacteria of the phylum Bacteroidetes. Comparative genomic analysis of the three candidate phage families revealed features without precedent in phage genomes. Some \"Quimbyviridae\" phages possess Diversity-Generating Retroelements (DGRs) that generate hypervariable target genes nested within defense-related genes, whereas the previously known targets of phage-encoded DGRs are structural genes. Several \"Flandersviridae\" phages encode enzymes of the isoprenoid pathway, a lipid biosynthesis pathway that so far has not been known to be manipulated by phages. The \"Gratiaviridae\" phages encode a HipA-family protein kinase and glycosyltransferase, suggesting these phages modify the host cell wall, preventing superinfection by other phages. Hundreds of phages in these three and other families are shown to encode catalases and iron-sequestering enzymes that can be predicted to enhance cellular tolerance to reactive oxygen species.\n\nConclusionsAnalysis of phage genomes identified in whole-community human gut metagenomes resulted in the delineation of at least three new candidate families of Caudovirales and revealed diverse putative mechanisms underlying phage-host interactions in the human gut. Addition of these phylogenetically classified, diverse and distinct phages to public databases will facilitate taxonomic decomposition and functional characterization of human gut viromes.",

    "abstract": "Drug resistance in tuberculosis (TB) poses a major ongoing challenge to public health. The recent inclusion of bedaquiline into TB drug regimens has improved treatment outcomes, but this advance is threatened by the emergence of strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) resistant to bedaquiline. Clinical bedaquiline resistance is most frequently conferred by off-target resistance-associated variants (RAVs) in the mmpR5 gene (Rv0678), the regulator of an efflux pump, which can also confer cross-resistance to clofazimine, another TB drug. We compiled a dataset of 3,682 Mtb genomes, including 157 carrying variants in mmpR5 that have been linked to resistance. We identified nine cases where RAVs were present in the genomes of strains collected prior to the use of bedaquiline in TB treatment regimes. Phylogenetic reconstruction points to multiple emergence events and circulation of RAVs in mmpR5, some estimated to predate the introduction of bedaquiline or clofazimine. However, epistatic interactions can complicate bedaquiline drug-susceptibility prediction from genetic sequence data. Indeed, in one clade of isolates where the RAV Ile67fs is estimated to have emerged prior to the antibiotic era, co-occurrence of mutations in mmpL5 are found to neutralise bedaquiline resistance. The presence of a pre-existing reservoir of Mtb strains carrying bedaquiline RAVs augments the need for rapid drug susceptibility testing and individualised regimen selection to safeguard the use of bedaquiline in TB care and control.",

Current clinical monitoring, however, does not directly measure spinal cord blood flow, resulting in poor sensitivity/specificity, delayed alerts, and delayed intervention. We have developed an epidural device employing diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) to monitor spinal cord ischemia continuously at multiple positions. We investigate the ability of this device to localize spinal cord ischemia in a porcine model and validate DCS versus Laser Doppler Flowmetry (LDF).\n\nSpecifically, we demonstrate continuous (>0.1Hz) spatially resolved (3 locations) monitoring of spinal cord blood flow in a purely ischemic model with an epidural DCS probe. Changes in blood flow measured by DCS and LDF were highly correlated (r=0.83). Spinal cord blood flow measured by DCS caudal to aortic occlusion decreased 62%, with a sensitivity of 0.87 and specificity of 0.91 for detection of a 25% decrease in flow. This technology may enable early identification and critically important localization of spinal cord ischemia.",

    "abstract": "Hypoxic regions (habitats) within tumors are heterogeneously distributed and can be widely variant. Hypoxic habitats are generally pan-therapy resistant. For this reason, hypoxia-activated prodrugs (HAPs) have been developed to target these resistant volumes. The HAP evofosfamide (TH-302) has shown promise in preclinical and early clinical trials of sarcoma. However, in a phase III clinical trial, TH-302 did not improve survival in combination with doxorubicin (dox), most likely due to a lack of patient stratification based on hypoxic status. Herein, our goal was to develop deep-learning (DL) models to identify hypoxic habitats, using multiparametric (mp) MRI and co-registered histology, and to non-invasively monitor response to TH-302 in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) of rhabdomyosarcoma and a syngeneic model of fibrosarcoma (RIF-1). A DL convolutional neural network showed strong correlations (>0.81) between the true hypoxic portion in histology and the predicted hypoxic portion in multiparametric MRI. TH-302 monotherapy or in combination with Dox delayed tumor growth and increased survival in the hypoxic PDX model (p<0.05), but not in the RIF-1 model, which had lower volume of hypoxic habitats. Control studies showed that RIF-1 resistance was due to hypoxia and not to other causes. Notably, PDX tumors developed resistance to TH-302 under prolonged treatment. In conclusion, response to TH-302 can be attributed to differences in hypoxia status prior therapy. Development of non-invasive MR imaging to assess hypoxia is crucial in determining the effectiveness of TH-302 therapy and to follow response. In further studies, our approach can be used to better plan therapeutic schedules to avoid resistance.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryDevelopment of non-invasive MR imaging to assess hypoxia is crucial in determining the effectiveness of TH-302 therapy and to follow response.",

    "abstract": "Magnetoreception, the response to geomagnetic fields is a well described phenomenon in nature. However, it is likely that convergent evolution led to different mechanisms in different organisms. One intriguing example is the unique Electromagnetic Perceptive Gene (EPG) from the glass catfish Kryptopterus vitreolus, that can remotely control cellular function, upon magnetic stimulation in in-vitro and in-vivo. Here, we report for the first time the cellular location and orientation of the EPG protein. We utilized a differential labelling technique to determine that the EPG protein is a membrane anchored protein with an N-terminal extracellular domain. The kinetics and diffusion dynamics of the EPG protein in response to magnetic stimulation was also elucidated using single particle imaging and tracking. Pulse chase labelling and Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) imaging revealed an increase in EPG kinetics post magnetic activation at a single particle level. Trajectory analysis show notably different EPG protein kinetics before and after magnetic stimulation in both 2 (free vs bound particle) and 3 state (free vs intermediate vs bound particle) tracking models. This data provides additional information to support and understand the underlying biophysical mechanisms behind EPG activation by magnetic fields and provides evidence for the basis of magnetoreception in the EPG protein that will aid in future studies that seek to further understand this novel mechanism. This study is important for understanding magnetoreception as well as developing new technologies for magnetogenetics - the utilization of electromagnetic fields to remotely control cellular function.\n\nTable of Contents Graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=126 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/329946v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ce4aborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e8bb89org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1705113org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dadf23_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Cerebellar ataxia is associated with an implicit motor learning dysfunction, specifically, a miscalibration of internal models relating motor commands to state changes of the body. Explicit cognitive strategies could compensate for deficits in implicit calibration. Surprisingly, however, patients with cerebellar ataxia use insufficient strategies compared to healthy controls. We report a candidate physiological phenomenon of disrupted strategy use in cerebellar ataxia, reflected in an interaction of implicit and explicit learning effects on cortical beta oscillations. We recorded electroencephalography in patients with cerebellar ataxia (n=18), age-matched healthy controls (n=19), and young, healthy individuals (n=34) during a visuomotor rotation paradigm in which an aiming strategy was either explicitly instructed, or had to be discovered through learning. In young, healthy individuals, learning a strategy, but not implicit learning from sensory prediction error alone, decreased the post-movement beta rebound. Disrupted learning from sensory prediction error in patients, on the other hand, unmasked effects of explicit and implicit control that are normally balanced. Specifically, the post-movement beta rebound increased during strategy use when implicit learning was disrupted, i.e., in patients, but not controls. We conclude that a network disturbance due to cerebellar degeneration surfaces in imbalanced cortical beta oscillations normally involved in strategy learning.",

    "abstract": "In most animals, the majority of the nervous system is generated and assembled into neuronal circuits during embryonic development. However, during juvenile stages, nervous systems still undergo extensive anatomical and functional changes to eventually form a fully mature nervous system by the adult stage. The molecular changes in post-mitotic neurons across post-embryonic development and the genetic programs that control these temporal transitions are not well understood. Using the model organism C. elegans, we comprehensively characterized the distinct functional states (locomotor behavior) and corresponding distinct molecular states (transcriptome) of the post-mitotic nervous system across temporal transitions from early post-embryonic periods to adulthood. We observed pervasive changes in gene expression, many of which are controlled by the developmental upregulation of the conserved heterochronic miRNA lin-4/mir-125 and the subsequent promotion of a mature neuronal transcriptional program through the repression of its target, the transcription factor lin-14. The functional relevance of these molecular transitions are exemplified by a temporally regulated target gene of the lin-14 transcription factor, nlp-45, a neuropeptide-encoding gene. We found that nlp-45 is required for temporal transitions in exploratory activity across larval stages, across sexual maturation, and into a diapause arrest stage. Our studies provide new insights into regulatory strategies that control neuron-type specific gene batteries to modulate distinct behaviors states across temporal, sex and environmental dimensions of post-embryonic development, and also provides a rich atlas of post-embryonic molecular changes to uncover additional regulatory mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWestern-style diet (WSD), which is high in fat and low in fiber, lacks nutrients to support gut microbiota. Consequently, WSD promotes microbiota encroachment and reduces microbiota density, potentially influencing colonization resistance, immune system readiness, and, consequently host defense against pathogenic bacteria. Additionally, the low-nutrient colonic environment resulting from WSD might impact bacterial pathogens.\n\nAimsExamine impact of WSD on infection and colitis in response to gut bacterial pathogens.\n\nMethodsMice fed grain-based chow (GBC), WSD, or various versions thereof, were orally infected with Citrobacter rodentium or C. difficile. Colonization and its consequences, including inflammation and death were monitored.\n\nResultsWSD delayed Citrobacter growth, reduced its virulence gene expression and ameliorated inflammation. However, while GBC-fed mice uniformly cleared Citrobacter and were impervious to subsequent Citrobacter challenges, most WSD-fed mice remained chronically infected with Citrobacter while those that cleared it were highly prone to re-infection. Such persistent proneness to Citrobacter infection did not reflect reduced immune responsiveness but rather reflected reduced colonization resistance likely from the low microbiota density resulting from WSD feeding. While persistent Citrobacter infection did not cause overt inflammation, it was associated with low-grade inflammation in colon and adipose tissue that was associated with insulin resistance. An analogous pattern was seen in response to C. difficile with WSD resulting in delayed colonization and mortality while enriching WSD with fiber hastened colonization but afforded clearance and survival.\n\nAltering microbiota via diet can profoundly impact the course and consequence of infection following exposure to gut bacterial pathogens.\n\nSynopsisDietary fiber results in a nutrient rich colon that is exploited by gut pathogens including C. rodentium and C. difficile, that rapidly colonize the colon. Hight-fat, low-fiber western-style diet results in a low-density gut microbiota unable to mediate clearance of pathogens from the colon. Inability to clear pathogens from the gut lumen promotes chronic low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance.\n\nGraphic summaryThe low-fiber content of WSD impedes initial colonization of pathogens. Immune system functions appropriately irrespective of diet to clear pathogens from the mucosa. Commensal microbiota of mice fed GBC but not WSD is sufficient to eliminate pathogen from the lumen of the intestine.

    "abstract": "Methane gas (CH4) reservoirs have previously been reported in tropical marine sediments of Saco do Mamangua ria (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). It is known that a methane microbiome can be established in methane seeps sites; however, they are still poorly characterised. In this study, we aimed to investigate the spatial and vertical distribution of the bacterial and archaeal composition and the community structure in the sediments of Saco do Mamangua ria. For this purpose, we collected sediment samples through 100 cm long gravity corer at three different sites and performed community analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, quantification of the methyl coenzyme M reductase-encoding gene (mcrA) and geochemical analysis, including CH4 stable isotope. Our results revealed a biogenic trend for CH4 isotopic signature and a high proportion of archaeal sequences assigned as Bathyarchaeota, with a spatial distribution throughout the inner areas of the channel and the deepest strata. OTUs classified within Bathyarchaeota and Chloroflexi (Dehalococcoidia) showed positive correlation with methane concentrations, sediment depth and oxidation-reduction potential. Due to their prevalence in the microbial community, we also performed phylogenetic analysis to understand the closeness of our Bathyarchaeota OTUs with Bathyarchaeota subgroups, and the results demonstrated a close relationship particularly with Bathy-8 and Bathy-13, which possess genes for acetogenesis and methanogenesis. Although direct relations between microbial populations and the biogenic methane emissions in Saco do Mamangua cannot be assured, our results emphasize the importance of further investigations about the potential role of Bathyarchaeota in the carbon cycling in methane-rich tropical shallow ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "The epicardium is a cell layer found on the external surface of the heart. During development it has an epithelial identity and contains progenitor cells for coronary smooth muscle and cardiac fibroblasts. The epicardium has been suggested to have therapeutic potential in cardiac repair. Study of epicardial development has been difficult because it is dynamic and morphologically complex. We developed a flow cytometry-based method to quantify cardiac development including the epicardial lineage. This provided accurate and sensitive analysis of (1) the emergence of epicardial progenitors within the proepicardium (2) their transfer to the heart to form the epicardium, and (3) their epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to create the subepicardium. Platelet-derived growth factor alpha (Pdgfra) and Wilms tumor protein (Wt1) have both been reported to be pro-mesenchymal during epicardial EMT. Quantitative analysis with flow cytometry confirmed a pro-mesenchymal role for Pdgfra but not for Wt1. Analysis of Wt1 null embryos showed that they had (1) poor formation of proepicardial villi, (2) reduced transfer of proepicardial cells to the heart, (3) a discontinuous epicardium with poor epithelial identity, and (4) a proportionally excessive number of mesenchymal-like cells. This data shows that Wt1 is essential for epicardial formation and maintenance rather than being pro-mesenchymal.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPlaque psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by the development of red scaly plaques. To date psoriasis lesional skin transcriptome has been extensively studied, whereas only few proteomic studies of psoriatic skin are available.\n\nAimThe aim of this study was to compare protein expression patterns of lesional and normally looking skin of psoriasis patients with skin of the healthy volunteers, reveal differentially expressed proteins and identify changes in cell metabolism caused by the disease.\n\nMethodsSkin samples of normally looking and lesional skin donated by psoriasis patients (n = 5) and samples of healthy skin donated by volunteers (n = 5) were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). After protein identification and data processing, the set of differentially expressed proteins was subjected to protein ontology analysis to characterize changes in biological processes, cell components and molecular functions in the patients skin compared to skin of the healthy volunteers.\n\nResultsThe performed analysis identified 405 and 59 differentially expressed proteins in lesional and normally looking psoriatic skin compared to healthy control. We discovered decreased expression of KNG1, APOE, HRG, THBS1 and PLG in normally looking skin of the patients. Presumably, these changes were needed to protect the epidermis from spontaneous activation of kallikrein-kinin system and delay the following development of inflammatory response. In lesional skin, we identified several large groups of proteins with coordinated expression. Mainly, these proteins were involved in different aspects of protein and RNA metabolism, namely ATP synthesis and consumption; intracellular trafficking of membrane-bound vesicles, pre-RNA processing, translation, chaperoning and degradation in proteasomes/immunoproteasomes.\n\nConclusionOur findings explain the molecular basis of metabolic changes caused by disease in skin lesions, such as faster cell turnover and higher metabolic rate. They also indicate on downregulation of kallikrein-kinin system in normally looking skin of the patients that would be needed to delay exacerbation of the disease.

The two founder mutations in exon 13 (c.2299delG and c.2276G>T) collectively account for ~34% of USH2A-associated RP cases. Skipping of exon 13 from the USH2A transcript during pre-mRNA splicing presents a potential treatment modality in which the resulting transcript is predicted to encode a slightly shortened usherin protein. Morpholino-induced skipping of ush2a exon 13 in larvae of the previously published ush2a exon 13 zebrafish mutant resulted in the production of usherin{Delta}exon13 and completely restored retinal function. RNA antisense oligonucleotides were investigated for their potential to specifically induce human USH2A exon 13 skipping. Lead candidate QR-421a induced dose-dependent exon 13 skipping in iPSC-derived photoreceptor precursors from a patient homozygous for the USH2A c.2299delG mutation. Intravitreal delivery of QR-421a in non-human primates showed that QR-421a penetrates the retinal outer nuclear layer and induces detectable levels of exon 13 skipping until at least 3 months post injection. In conclusion, QR-421a-induced exon skipping proves to be a highly promising treatment for RP caused by mutations in exon 13 of the USH2A gene.",

The objectives of research reported in this manuscript were to evaluate the most commonly used genomic prediction method, ridge regression and its equivalent logistic ridge regression method, with algorithmic modeling methods including random forest, gradient boosting, support vector machine, K-nearest neighbors, Naive Bayes, and artificial neural network using the usual comparator metric of prediction accuracy. In addition we compared the methods using metrics of greater importance for decisions about selecting and culling lines for use in variety development and genetic improvement projects. These metrics include specificity, sensitivity, precision, decision accuracy, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.

    "abstract": "Numerous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted to date revealed genetic variants associated with various diseases, including breast and prostate cancers. Despite the availability of these large-scale data, relatively few variants have been functionally characterized, mainly because the majority of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) map to the non-coding regions of the human genome. The functional characterization of these non-coding variants and the identification of their target genes remain challenging. In this communication, we explore the potential functional mechanisms of non-coding SNPs by integrating GWAS with the high-resolution chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data for breast and prostate cancers. We show that more genetic variants map to regulatory elements through the 3D genome structure than the 1D linear genome lacking physical chromatin interactions. Importantly, the association of enhancers, transcription factors, and their target genes with breast and prostate cancers tends to be higher when these regulatory elements are mapped to high-risk SNPs through spatial interactions compared to simply using a linear proximity. Finally, we demonstrate that topologically associating domains (TADs) carrying high-risk SNPs also contain gene regulatory elements whose association with cancer is generally higher than those belonging to control TADs containing no high-risk variants. Our results suggest that many SNPs may contribute to the cancer development by affecting the expression of certain tumor-related genes through long-range chromatin interactions with gene regulatory elements. Integrating large-scale genetic datasets with the 3D genome structure offers an attractive and unique approach to systematically investigate the functional mechanisms of genetic variants in disease risk and progression.",

Here, MSI with high mass resolution together with multiple stable isotope labelling provided spatial analyses of phosphatidylcholine (PC) metabolism in mouse lungs. Dysregulated surfactant metabolism is central to many respiratory diseases. Metabolism and turnover of therapeutic pulmonary surfactants were imaged from distributions of intact and metabolic products of an added tracer, universally 13C-labelled dipalmitoyl PC (U[13C]DPPC). The parenchymal distributions of newly synthesised PC species were also imaged from incorporations of methyl-D9-choline. This dual labelling strategy demonstrated both lack of inhibition of endogenous PC synthesis by exogenous surfactant and location of acyl chain remodelling processes acting on the U[13C]DPPC-labelled surfactant, leading to formation of polyunsaturated PC lipids. This ability to visualise discrete metabolic events will greatly enhance our understanding of lipid metabolism in diverse tissues, and has potential application to both clinical and experimental studies.",

    "abstract": "Approaches for systematizing information of relatedness between organisms is important in biology. Phylogenetic analyses based on sets of highly conserved genes are currently the basis for the Tree of Life. Genome-scale metabolic reconstructions contain high-quality information regarding the metabolic capability of an organism and are typically restricted to metabolically active enzyme-encoding genes. While there are many tools available to generate draft reconstructions, expert-level knowledge is still required to generate and manually curate high-quality genome-scale metabolic models and to fill gaps in their reaction networks. Here, we use the tool AutoKEGGRec to construct 975 genome-scale metabolic draft reconstructions encoded in the KEGG database without further curation. The organisms are selected across all three domains, and their metabolic networks serve as basis for generating phylogenetic trees.\n\nWe find that using all reactions encoded, these metabolism-based comparisons give rise to a phylogenetic tree with close similarity to the Tree of Life. While this tree is quite robust to reasonable levels of noise in the metabolic reaction content of an organism, we find a significant heterogeneity in how much noise an organism may tolerate before it is incorrectly placed in the tree. Furthermore, by using the protein sequences for particular metabolic functions and pathway sets, such as central carbon-, nitrogen-, and sulfur-metabolism, as basis for the organism comparisons, we generate highly specific phylogenetic trees. We believe the generation of phylogenetic trees based on metabolic reaction content, in particular when focused on specific functions and pathways, could aid the identification of functionally important metabolic enzymes and be of value for genome-scale metabolic modellers and enzyme-engineers.",

To test whether Mbd2, which is overexpressed in human breast cancer samples and in MMTV-PyMT mammary pads, plays a causal role in mammary tumor growth and metastasis we depleted Mbd2 in transgenic MMTV-PyMT model of breast cancer by cross-breeding with Mbd2 knockout mice to generate heterozygous (PyMT;Mbd2+/-) and homozygous (PyMT;Mbd2-/-) animals. We found that Mbd2 depletion caused a gene dose-dependent delay in mammary tumor formation, reduced primary tumor burden, and lung metastasis at the experimental endpoint. In addition, animals from the PyMT;Mbd2-/- group survived significantly longer compared to the wildtype (PyMT;Mbd2+/+) and PyMT;Mbd2+/- arms. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of the primary tumors obtained from PyMT;Mbd2+/+ and PyMT;Mbd2+/- groups revealed that Mbd2 depletion alters several key determinants of the molecular signaling networks related to tumorigenesis and metastasis, which thereby demonstrate that Mbd2 is regulating transcriptional programs critical for breast cancer. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating a causal role for a DNA-methylation reader in breast cancer. Results from this study will provide the rationale for further development of first-in-class targeted epigenetic therapies against Mbd2 to inhibit the progression of breast and other common cancers.",

Here, we show that TTM1 is specifically involved in senescence induced by abscisic acid (ABA). Moreover, phosphorylation of TTM1 by multiple mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) regulates its function and turnover. A combination of proteomics and in vitro kinase assays revealed three major phosphorylation sites of TTM1 (S10, S437, and S490), which are phosphorylated upon perception of senescence cues such as ABA and prolonged darkness. S437 is phosphorylated by the MAP kinases MPK3 and MPK4, and S437 phosphorylation is essential for TTM1 function in senescence. These MPKs, together with three additional MAP kinases (MPK1, MPK7, and MPK6), phosphorylate S10 and S490, marking TTM1 for protein turnover, which likely prevents uncontrolled cell death. Taken together, our results show that multiple MPKs regulate the function and turnover of the mitochondrial protein TTM1 during senescence-related PCD, revealing a novel link between mitochondria and PCD.\n\nSummaryEmail addresses: purva.karia@mail.utoronto.ca",

    "abstract": "The spatiotemporal distribution of mitochondria is crucial for precise ATP provision and calcium buffering required to support neuronal signaling. Fast-spiking GABAergic interneurons expressing parvalbumin (PV) have a high mitochondrial content reflecting their large energy utilization. The importance for correct trafficking and precise mitochondrial positioning remains poorly elucidated in inhibitory neurons. Miro1 is a Ca2+-sensing adaptor protein that links mitochondria to the trafficking apparatus, for their microtubule-dependent transport along axons and dendrites, in order to meet the metabolic and Ca2+-buffering requirements of the cell. Here, we explore the role of Miro1 in parvalbumin interneurons and how changes in mitochondrial trafficking could alter brain network activity. By employing live and fixed imaging, we found that the impairments in Miro1-directed trafficking in PV+ interneurons altered their mitochondrial distribution and axonal arborization. These changes were accompanied by an increase in the ex vivo hippocampal {gamma}-oscillation (30 - 80 Hz) frequency and promoted anxiolysis. Our findings show that precise regulation of mitochondrial dynamics in PV+ interneurons is crucial for proper neuronal signaling and network synchronization.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we determined the diversity and dynamics of the gut virome of infants during the first year of life. Fecal samples were collected monthly, from birth to one year of age, from three healthy children living in a semi-rural village in Mexico. Most of the viral reads were classified into six families of bacteriophages including five dsDNA virus families of the order Caudovirales, with Siphoviridae and Podoviridae being the most abundant. Eukaryotic viruses were detected as early as two weeks after birth and remained present all along the first year of life. Thirty-four different eukaryotic virus families were found, where eight of these families accounted for 98% of all eukaryotic viral reads: Anelloviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Genomoviridae, Parvoviridae, Picornaviridae, Reoviridae and the plant-infecting viruses of the Virgaviridae family. Some viruses in these families are known human pathogens, and it is surprising that they were found during the first year of life in infants without gastrointestinal symptoms. The eukaryotic virus species richness found in this work was higher than that observed in previous studies; on average between 7 and 24 virus species were identified per sample. The richness and abundance of the eukaryotic virome significantly increased during the second semester of life, probably because of an increased environmental exposure of infants with age. Our findings suggest an early and permanent contact of infants with a diverse array of bacteriophages and eukaryotic viruses, whose composition changes over time. The bacteriophages and eukaryotic viruses found in these children could represent a metastable virome, whose potential influence on the development of the infants immune system or on the health of the infants later in life, remains to be investigated.",

    "abstract": "Steroidal estrogens are often accumulated in urban estuarine sediments worldwide at microgram per gram levels. These aromatic steroids have been classified as endocrine disruptors with an EC50 at sub-nanomolar concentrations and classified as Group 1 carcinogens by the World Health Organization. Microbial degradation is a naturally occurring mechanism that mineralizes estrogens in the biosphere; however, the corresponding genes in estrogen-degrading actinobacteria remain unidentified. In this study, we identified a gene cluster encoding several putative estrogen-degrading genes in actinobacterium Rhodococcus sp. strain B50. Among them, the oecB and oecC genes involved in estrogenic A-ring cleavage were identified through gene-disruption experiments. We also detected the accumulation of two extracellular estrogenic metabolites, including pyridinestrone acid (PEA) and 3a-H-4(3-propanoate)-7a{beta}-methylhexahydro-1,5-indanedione (HIP), in the estrone-fed strain B50 cultures. Since actinobacterial oecC and proteobacterial oecC shared less than 40% sequence identity, oecC could serve as a specific biomarker to differentiate the contribution of actinobacteria and proteobacteria in environmental estrogen degradation. Therefore, oecC and the extracellular metabolites PEA and HIP were used as biomarkers to investigate estrogen biodegradation in an urban estuarine sediment. Interestingly, our data suggested that actinobacteria, rather than alpha-proteobacteria function in sewage treatment plants, are actively degrading estrogens in the urban estuarine sediment.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=139 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/329094v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (93K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17e1e23org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ecc60borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@be03d4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ed81d6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIIsolation of an estrogen-degrading actinobacterium Rhodococcus sp. strain B50 and establishment of a strain B50 genetic manipulation system.\nC_LIO_LIStrain B50 exhibits a two-fold estrogen degradation rate of that of estrogen-degrading alpha-proteobacteria under the same cultivation conditions.\nC_LIO_LIFunctional characterization of two oxygenase genes, oecB and oecC, involved in estrogenic A-ring cleavage in actinobacteria.\nC_LIO_LIIdentification of two extracellular estrogenic metabolites, PEA and HIP, in the estrone-fed strain B50 cultures.\nC_LIO_LIDetection of actinobacterial oecC sequences as well as PEA and HIP in the estrone-spiked urban estuarine sediments.\nC_LI",

However, the data of genetic diversity and their spatial connectivity of populations in Indonesia are not yet known, which is important to inform unit stock management and sustainable fisheries. This study aimed to determine genetic diversity and differentiation of blue swimming crab across Indonesia populations under different Fishery Management Area, and their spatial genetic connectivity, as well as implications for sustainable fishery. A total of 297 individuals were amplified using cytochrome oxidase I mitochondrial DNA. This study shown highest value of haplotype and nucleotide diversity in the eastern part of Indonesia, where exploitation is relatively low. Significant genetic differentiation between populations (FST = 0.954; p < 0.001) and the fishery management regions (FST = 0.964; p < 0.001) were revealed. Low spatial connectivity was observed between populations in a distance of at least more than 60 kilometers. This study suggests that BSC populations in Indonesia likely have several unit stock, and preferably different fisheries management plan and action across the region thoroughly and simultaneously is effective for management and their sustainable conservation.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria, which are excluded from the secretory pathway, depend on lipid transport proteins for their lipid supply from the ER, where most lipids are synthesized. In yeast, the outer mitochondrial membrane GTPase Gem1 is an accessory factor of ERMES, an ER-mitochondria tethering complex that contains lipid transport domains and that functions, partially redundantly with Vps13, in lipid transfer between the two organelles. In metazoa, where VPS13, but not ERMES, is present, the Gem1 orthologue Miro was linked to mitochondria dynamics but not to lipid transport. Here we show that Miro, including its peroxisome-enriched splice variant, recruits the lipid transport protein VPS13D, which in turn binds the ER in a VAP-dependent way and thus could provide a lipid conduit between the ER and mitochondria. These findings reveal a so far missing link between function(s) of Gem1/Miro in yeast and higher eukaryotes, where Miro is a Parkin substrate, with potential implications for Parkinsons disease pathogenesis.\n\nSummaryVPS13D mutations result in severe mitochondrial defects. Guillen-Samander et al, show that VPS13D binds VAP in the ER, and interacts with Miro on mitochondria and peroxisomes, so that it can provide a bridge for lipid transport between these organelles.",

    "abstract": "Salmonellosis and listeriosis together accounted for more than one third of foodborne illnesses in the United States and almost half the hospitalizations for gastrointestinal diseases in 2018 while tuberculosis afflicted over 10 million people worldwide causing almost 2 million deaths. Regardless of the intrinsic virulence differences among Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, these intracellular pathogens share the ability to survive and persist inside the macrophage and other cells and thrive in iron rich environments. Interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}) is a central cytokine in host defense against intracellular pathogens and has been shown to promote iron export in macrophages. We hypothesize that IFN-{gamma} decreases iron availability to intracellular pathogens consequently limiting replication in these cells. In this study, we show that IFN-{gamma} regulates the expression of iron-related proteins hepcidin, ferroportin, and ferritin to induce iron export from macrophages. Listeria monocytogenes, S. enterica, and M. tuberculosis infections significantly induce iron sequestration in human macrophages. In contrast, IFN-{gamma} significantly reduces hepcidin secretion in S. enterica and M. tuberculosis infected macrophages. Similarly, IFN-{gamma}-activated macrophages express higher ferroportin levels than untreated controls even after infection with L. monocytogenes bacilli; bacterial infection greatly down-regulates ferroportin expression. Collectively, IFN-{gamma} significantly inhibits pathogen-associated intracellular iron sequestration in macrophages and consequently retards the growth of intracellular bacterial pathogens by decreasing iron availability.",

    "abstract": "The fish species Astyanax mexicanus with its sighted and blind eco-morphotypes has become an original model to challenge vertebrate developmental evolution. Recently, we demonstrated that phenotypic evolution can be impacted by early developmental events starting from the production of oocytes in the fish ovaries. A. mexicanus offers an amenable model to test the influence of maternal effect on cell fate decisions during early development, yet the mechanisms by which the information contained in the eggs is translated into specific developmental programs remain obscure due to the lack of specific tools in this emergent model. Here we describe methods for the generation of gastruloids from yolkless-blastoderm explants to test the influence of embryonic and extraembryonic properties on cell fate decisions, as well as the production of chimeric embryos obtained by intermorph cell transplantations to probe cell autonomous or non-autonomous processes. We show that Astyanax gastruloids have the potential to recapitulate the main ontogenetic events observed in intact embryos, including the internalization of mesodermal progenitors and eye development, as followed with Zic:GFP reporter lines. In addition, intermorph cell grafts resulted in proper integration of exogenous cells into the embryonic tissues, with lineages becoming more restricted from mid-blastula to gastrula. The implementation of these approaches in A. mexicanus will bring new light on the cascades of events, from the maternal pre-patterning of the early embryo to the evolution of brain regionalization.",

    "abstract": "Developmental mechanisms that canalize or compensate perturbations of organismal development (targeted or compensatory growth) are widely considered a prerequisite of individual health and the evolution of complex life, but little is known about the nature of these mechanisms. It is even unclear if and how a \"target trajectory\" of individual development is encoded in the organisms genetic-developmental system or, instead, emerges as an epiphenomenon. Here we develop a statistical model of developmental canalization based on an extended autoregressive model. We show that under certain assumptions the strength of canalization and the amount of canalized variance in a population can be estimated, or at least approximated, from longitudinal phenotypic measurements, even if the target trajectories are unobserved. We extend this model to multivariate measures and discuss reifications of the ensuing parameter matrix. We apply these approaches to longitudinal geometric morphometric data on human postnatal craniofacial size and shape as well as to the size of the frontal sinuses. Craniofacial size showed strong developmental canalization during the first 5 years of life, leading to a 50% reduction of cross-sectional size variance, followed by a continual increase in variance during puberty. Frontal sinus size, by contrast, did not show any signs of canalization. Total variance of craniofacial shape decreased slightly until about 5 years of age and increased thereafter. However, different feature of craniofacial shape showed very different developmental dynamics. Whereas the relative dimensions of the nasopharynx showed strong canalization and a reduction of variance throughout postnatal development, facial orientation continually increased in variance. Some of the signals of canalization may owe to independent variation in developmental timing of cranial components, but our results indicate evolved, partly mechanically induced mechanisms of canalization that ensure properly sized upper airways and facial dimensions.\n\nAuthor summaryDevelopmental mechanisms that canalize or compensate perturbations of organismal development are a prerequisite of individual health and the evolution of complex life.

    "abstract": "There is a research gap related to the combined effects of compost produced from coffee husks and inorganic nitrogen fertilizer (urea). The objective of this study was to evaluate the yield and yield components of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under the integrated application of compost and nitrogen fertilizer (urea). A pot experiment was conducted in a lath house to determine the effects of the integrated use of compost produced from coffee husks and nitrogen fertilizer (urea) on the yield and yield components of wheat. The experiment consisted of nine treatments: T1, control (untreated); T2, 5 t ha-1 (8.12 g pot-1) compost; T3, 10 t ha-1 (16.24 g pot-1) compost; T4, 0 t ha-1 compost + 50 kg ha-1 nitrogen fertilizer (NF) (0.09 g pot-1); T5, 5 t ha-1 compost + 50 kg ha-1 NF; T6, 10 t ha-1 compost + 50 kg ha-1 NF; T7, 0 t ha-1 compost + 100 kg ha-1 (0.18 g pot-1) NF; T8, 5 t ha-1 compost + 100 kg ha-1 NF; and T9, 10 t ha-1 compost + 100 kg ha-1 NF. The treatments were arranged in a completely randomized design (CRD) with three replications. The compost was prepared from coffee husks and applied in wet conditions. The findings showed that the addition of compost had little effect on wheat yield and yield components in the absence of nitrogen fertilizer (urea). However, the application of the highest amount of nitrogen fertilizer (urea), which is equivalent to the recommended field rate (100 kg ha-1) (equivalent to 0.18 g pot-1), and compost (5 t ha-1) (equivalent to 8.12 g pot-1) led to a significant (P[&le;]0.05) increase in grain yield. Under this treatment, the grain yield was 26 g pot-1 (equivalent to 14.741 t ha-1) which is a 66.29% increase compared with the control (8.9 g pot-1 (4.969 t ha-1)); in the treatment in which only the recommended amount of nitrogen fertilizer was used (21.98 g pot-1 (12.273 t ha-1)) grain yield increased by 16.74%. Spike length and dry matter yield also significantly (P[&le;]0.05) increased with the application of integrated compost and nitrogen fertilizer (urea). The results of this experiment revealed that compost-based soil management strategies can enhance wheat production, thereby contributing positively to the viability and benefits of agricultural production systems. However, nutrient-compost interactions should receive special attention due to the great variability in the properties of compost, which may depend on the type of organic materials used.",

    "abstract": "For various species, high quality sequences and complete genomes are nowadays available for many individuals. This makes data analysis challenging, as methods need not only to be accurate, but also time efficient given the tremendous amount of data to process. In this article, we introduce an efficient method to infer the evolutionary history of individuals under the multispecies coalescent model in networks (MSNC). Phylogenetic networks are an extension of phylogenetic trees that can contain reticulate nodes, which allow to model complex biological events such as horizontal gene transfer, hybridization, introgression and recombination. We present a novel way to compute the likelihood of biallelic markers sampled along genomes whose evolution involved such events. This likelihood computation is at the heart of a Bayesian network inference method called SO_SCPLOWNAPPC_SCPLOWNO_SCPLOWETC_SCPLOW, as it extends the SO_SCPLOWNAPPC_SCPLOW method [1] inferring evolutionary trees under the multispecies coalescent model, to networks. SO_SCPLOWNAPPC_SCPLOWNO_SCPLOWETC_SCPLOW is available as a package of the well-known beast 2 software.\n\nRecently, the MCMCBiMarkers method [2] also extended SO_SCPLOWNAPPC_SCPLOW to networks. Both methods take biallelic markers as input, rely on the same model of evolution and sample networks in a Bayesian framework, though using different methods for computing priors. However, SO_SCPLOWNAPPC_SCPLOWNO_SCPLOWETC_SCPLOW relies on algorithms that are exponentially more time-efficient on non-trivial networks. Using extensive simulations, we compare performances of SO_SCPLOWNAPPC_SCPLOWNO_SCPLOWETC_SCPLOW and MCMCBiMarkers. We show that both methods enjoy similar abilities to recover simple networks, but SO_SCPLOWNAPPC_SCPLOWNO_SCPLOWETC_SCPLOW is more accurate than MCMCBiMarkers on more complex network scenarios. Also, on complex networks, SO_SCPLOWNAPPC_SCPLOWNO_SCPLOWETC_SCPLOW is found to be extremely faster than MCMCBiMarkers in terms of time required for the likelihood computation. We finally illustrate SO_SCPLOWNAPPC_SCPLOWNO_SCPLOWETC_SCPLOW performances on a rice data set. SO_SCPLOWNAPPC_SCPLOWNO_SCPLOWETC_SCPLOW infers a scenario that is compatible with simpler schemes proposed so far and provides additional understanding of rice evolution.\n\nAuthor summaryNowadays, to make the best use of the vast amount of genomic data at our disposal, there is a real need for methods able to model complex biological mechanisms such as hybridization and introgression. Understanding such mechanisms can help geneticists to elaborate strategies in crop improvement that may help reducing poverty and dealing with climate change. However, reconstructing such evolution scenarios is challenging. Indeed, the inference of phylogenetic networks, which explicitly model reticulation events such as hybridization and introgression, requires high computational resources. Then, on large data sets, biologists generally deduce reticulation events indirectly using species tree inference tools.\n\nIn this context, we present a new Bayesian method, called SO_SCPLOWNAPPC_SCPLOWNO_SCPLOWETC_SCPLOW, dedicated to phylogenetic network inference. Our method is competitive in terms of execution speed with respect to its competitors. This speed gain enables us to consider more complex evolution scenarios during Bayesian analyses. When applied to rice genomic data, SO_SCPLOWNAPPC_SCPLOWNO_SCPLOWETC_SCPLOW suggested a new evolution scenario, compatible with the existing ones: it posits cAus as the result of an early combination between the Indica and Japonica lineages, followed by a later combination between the cAus and Japonica lineages to derive cBasmati. This accounts for the well-documented wide hybrid compatibility of cAus.",

    "abstract": "The Hippo pathway is an important regulator of organ growth and cell fate. In the R8 photoreceptor cells of the Drosophila melanogaster eye, the Hippo pathway controls the fate choice between one of two subtypes that express either the blue light-sensitive Rhodopsin 5 (Hippo inactive) or the green light-sensitive Rhodopsin 6 (Hippo active). The degree to which the mechanism of Hippo signal transduction and the proteins that mediate it are conserved in organ growth and R8 cell fate choice is currently unclear. Here, we identify Crumbs and the apical spectrin cytoskeleton as regulators of R8 cell fate. By contrast, other proteins that influence Hippo-dependent organ growth, such as the basolateral spectrin cytoskeleton and Ajuba, are dispensable for the R8 cell fate choice. Surprisingly, Crumbs promotes the Rhodopsin 5 cell fate, which is driven by Yorkie, rather than the Rhodopsin 6 cell fate, which is driven by Warts and the Hippo pathway, which contrasts with its impact on Hippo activity in organ growth. Furthermore, neither the apical spectrin cytoskeleton nor Crumbs regulate the Hippo pathway through mechanisms that have been reported to operate in growing organs. Together, these results show that only a subset of Hippo pathway proteins regulate the R8 binary cell fate decision and that aspects of Hippo pathway signalling appear to differ between growing organs and post-mitotic R8 cells.",

Here, the Michaelis-Menten constants (kcat, KM, and kcat/KM) and thermal stability (TM) of five new mutations of {beta}-glucosidase B from Paenibacillus polymyxa (BglB) are characterized. Foldit software was used to create molecular models of the mutants, for which synthetic genes were constructed and the corresponding proteins produced and purified from E. coli. It was found that mutations that disrupted pre-existing hydrogen bonds near the active site had reduced expression in contrast to mutations at the same site that did not affect native hydrogen bonding. This is consistent with previous results showing the relationship between hydrogen bonding and enzyme functionality. These mutants contribute to a growing data set of >100 mutants that have been characterized for expression, kinetic, and thermal properties",

    "abstract": "Unraveling molecular regulatory networks underlying disease progression is critically important for understanding disease mechanisms and identifying drug targets. The existing methods for inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) rely mainly on time-course gene expression data. However, most available omics data from cross-sectional studies of cancer patients often lack sufficient temporal information, leading to a key challenge for GRN inference. Through quantifying the latent progression using random walks-based manifold distance, we propose a latent-temporal progression-based Bayesian method, PROB, for inferring GRNs from the cross-sectional transcriptomic data of tumor samples. The robustness of PROB to the measurement variabilities in the data is mathematically proved and numerically verified. Performance evaluation on real data indicates that PROB outperforms other methods in both pseudotime inference and GRN inference. Applications to bladder cancer and breast cancer demonstrate that our method is effective to identify key regulators of cancer progression or drug targets. The identified ACSS1 is experimentally validated to promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of bladder cancer cells, and the predicted FOXM1-targets interactions are verified and are predictive of relapse in breast cancer. Our study suggests new effective ways to clinical transcriptomic data modeling for characterizing cancer progression and facilitates the translation of regulatory network-based approaches into precision medicine.\n\nAuthor summaryReconstructing gene regulatory network (GRN) is an essential question in systems biology. The lack of temporal information in sample-based transcriptomic data leads to a major challenge for inferring GRN and its translation to precision medicine. To address the above challenge, we propose to decode the latent temporal information underlying cancer progression via ordering patient samples based on transcriptomic similarity, and design a latent-temporal progression-based Bayesian method to infer GRNs from sample-based transcriptomic data of cancer patients. The advantages of our method include its capability to infer causal GRNs (with directed and signed edges) and its robustness to the measurement variability in the data. Performance evaluation using both simulated data and real data demonstrate that our method outperforms other existing methods in both pseudotime inference and GRN inference. Our method is then applied to reconstruct EMT regulatory networks in bladder cancer and to identify key regulators underlying progression of breast cancer. Importantly, the predicted key regulators/interactions are experimentally validated. Our study suggests that inferring dynamic progression trajectory from static expression data of tumor samples helps to uncover regulatory mechanisms underlying cancer progression and to discovery key regulators which may be used as candidate drug targets.",

    "abstract": "The unexplored saline lagoons of the north of Peru harbor a rich microbiome, due to reported studies of different extreme environments around the world. In these regions, there are several ecosystems and microhabitats not yet explored, and little is known about the diversity of actinobacteria and other microorganisms. We suggest that the endemic bacteria present in this extreme environment could be source of active molecules with anticancer, antimicrobial, antiparasitic properties. Using phenotypic and genotypic characterization techniques including the 16S rRNA were identified into the genera Streptomyces 39 (78%), Pseudonocardia 3 (6%), Staphylococcus 4 (8%), Bacillus 2 (4%), and Pseudomonas 2 (4%). All isolated bacteria for the genotypic data were preliminarily identified. Actinobacteria strains were found dominantly in both sites (Lagoon1-3 = 16 isolates and lagoon 4 = 12 isolates). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 28 isolates were exclusively affiliated to eleven different clusters of Actinobacteria of the major genus Streptomyces. Three Streptomyces sp. strains M-92, B-146, and B-81, were tested for antibacterial and antiproliferative activities. The results showed antiproliferative activities against three tumor cell lines, U251 glioma; MCF7 breast; NCI-H460 lung non-small type of cells, and the antibacterial activity to Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, E. coli ATCC 10536, and Acinetobacter baumanni AC-972 which is resistant to multiple drugs. The promising results belong to Streptomyces sp. B-81 strain in the R2A medium using a doxorubicin with control positive, the best result was from the latter (TGI = 0,57 {micro}g/mL) for glioma; NCI-H460 lung of type non-small cells (TGI = 0,61 {micro}g/mL), and breast cancer (TGI =0,80 {micro}g/mL), this strain was selected to be fractionated because it had better antiproliferative and antibacterial activity, and its fractions were evaluated concerning antiproliferative activity against nine types of tumor cells and one non-tumor. The methanolic fraction showed a better result in the antiproliferative activity and was able to inhibit U251 (glioma) (TGI = 38.3 {micro}g/mL), OVCAR-03 (ovary) (TGI = 62.1 {micro}g/mL), and K562 (leukemia) (TGI = 81.5 {micro}g/mL). The methanol 50% - acetate 50% fraction (Fraction 4) inhibited U251 (glioma) (TGI = 73.5 {micro}g/mL) and UACC-62 (melanoma) (TGI = 89.4 {micro}g/mL). Moreover, the UHPLC-MS/MS data and molecular networking of Streptomyces sp. B-81 isolate extract revealed the production cholic acid, Lobophorin A, Lobophorin B, Lobophorin E, Lobophorin K and compound 6. Extremophilic environments such as the Morrope and Bayovar Salt Flats are promising sources of new bacteria with promising pharmaceutical potential; These compounds could be useful to treat various infectious diseases or even some type of cancer.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation of unfolded proteins within the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) activates a signal transduction pathway termed the unfolded protein response (UPR), which attempts to restore ER homeostasis. If homeostasis cannot be restored, UPR signalling ultimately induces apoptosis. Ca2+ depletion in the ER is a potent inducer of ER stress. Despite the ubiquity of Ca2+ as intracellular messenger, the precise mechanism (s) by which Ca2+ release affects the UPR remains unknown. Use of a genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator (GCamP6) that is tethered to the ER membrane, uncovered novel Ca2+ signalling events initiated by Ca2+ microdomains in human astrocytes under ER stress, as well as in a cell model deficient in all three IP3 Receptor isoforms. Pharmacological and molecular studies indicate that these local events are mediated by translocons. Together, these data reveal the existence of a previously unrecognized mechanism by which stressor-mediated Ca2+ release regulates ER stress.",

    "abstract": "In the African trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei, the cytoskeletal protein TbKHARON is required for trafficking of a putative Ca2+ channel to the flagellar membrane, and it is essential for parasite viability in both the mammalian stage bloodstream forms and the tsetse fly procyclic forms. This protein is located at the base of the flagellum, in the pellicular cytoskeleton, and in the mitotic spindle in both life cycle forms, and it likely serves multiple functions for these parasites. To begin to deconvolve the functions of KHARON, we have investigated partners associated with this protein and their roles in parasite biology. One KHARON associated protein, TbKHAP1, is a close interaction partner that can be crosslinked to KHARON by formaldehyde and pulled down in a molecular complex, and it colocalizes with TbKHARON in the basal body at the base of the flagellum. Knockdown of TbKHAP1 mRNA has similar phenotypes to knockdown of its partner TbKHARON, impairing trafficking of the Ca2+ channel to the flagellar membrane and blocking cytokinesis, implying that the TbKHARON/TbKHAP1 complex mediates trafficking of flagellar membrane proteins. Two other KHAPs, TbKHAP2 and TbKHAP3, are in close proximity to TbKHARON, but knockdown of their mRNAs does not affect trafficking of the Ca2+ channel. Two different flagellar membrane proteins, which are extruded from the flagellar membrane into extracellular vesicles, are also dependent upon TbKHARON for flagellar trafficking. These studies confirm that TbKHARON acts in complexes with other proteins to carry out various biological functions, and that some partners are involved in the core activity of targeting membrane proteins to the flagellum.",

    "abstract": "The abscission checkpoint regulates the ESCRT membrane fission machinery and thereby delays cytokinetic abscission to protect genomic integrity in response to residual mitotic errors. The checkpoint is maintained by Aurora B kinase, which phosphorylates multiple targets, including CHMP4C, a regulatory ESCRT-III subunit necessary for this checkpoint. We now report the discovery that cytoplasmic abscission checkpoint bodies (ACBs) containing phospho-Aurora B and tri-phospho-CHMP4C develop in telophase under an active checkpoint. ACBs are derived from Mitotic Interchromatin Granules (MIGs), transient mitotic structures whose components are housed in splicing-related nuclear speckles during interphase. ACB formation requires CHMP4C, and the ESCRT factor ALIX also contributes. ACB formation is conserved across cell types and under multiple circumstances that activate the checkpoint. Finally, ACBs retain a population of ALIX, and their presence correlates with delayed recruitment of ALIX to the midbody where it would normally promote abscission. Thus, a cytoplasmic mechanism helps regulate midbody machinery to delay abscission.",

    "abstract": "Centrosomes are composed of a centriolar core surrounded by a pericentriolar material (PCM) matrix that docks microtubule-nucleating {gamma}-tubulin complexes. During mitotic entry, the PCM matrix increases in size and nucleating capacity in a process called centrosome maturation. Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) localizes to centrosomes and phosphorylates PCM matrix proteins to drive their self-assembly, which leads to PCM expansion; this expansion has been assumed to passively increase microtubule nucleation to support spindle assembly. Here, we show that PLK1 directly controls the generation of binding sites for {gamma}-tubulin complexes on the PCM matrix, independently of PCM expansion. Selective inhibition of PLK1-dependent {gamma}-tubulin docking leads to spindle defects and impaired chromosome segregation, without affecting PCM expansion, highlighting the importance of phospho-regulated centrosomal {gamma}-tubulin docking sites in spindle assembly. Inhibiting both {gamma}-tubulin docking and PCM expansion by mutating substrate target sites fully accounts for the actions of PLK-1 in transforming the centrosome during mitotic entry.\n\nSummary StatementPolo-like kinase 1-mediated physical expansion of centrosomes during mitotic entry is proposed to passively increase their microtubule nucleating capacity. Ohta et al. show instead that generation of microtubule-nucleating sites is directly controlled by Polo-like kinase 1, independently of centrosome size.",

    "abstract": "Microtubules, polymers of alpha- and beta-tubulin, are essential cellular components. When microtubule polymerization is hindered, cells are delayed in mitosis, but eventually they manage to proliferate with massive chromosome missegregation. Several studies have analyzed the first cell division upon microtubules impairing conditions. Here, we asked how cells cope on the long term. Taking advantage of mutations in beta-tubulin, we evolved in the lab for [~]150 generations 24 populations of yeast cells unable to properly polymerize microtubules. At the end of the evolution experiment, cells re-gained the ability to form microtubules, and were less sensitive to microtubule depolymerizing drugs. Whole genome sequencing allowed us to identify genes recurrently mutated (tubulins and kinesins) as well as the pervasive duplication of chromosome VIII. We confirmed that mutations found in these genes and disomy of chromosome VIII allow cells to compensate for the original mutation in beta-tubulin. The mutations we identified were mostly gain-of-function, likely re-allowing the proper use of the mutated form of beta-tubulin. When we analyzed the temporal order of mutations leading to resistance in independent populations, we observed multiple times the same series of events: disomy of chromosome VIII followed by one additional adaptive mutation in either tubulins or kinesins. Analyzing the epistatic interactions among different mutations, we observed that some mutations benefited from the disomy of chromosome VIII and others did not. Given that tubulins are highly conserved among eukaryotes, our results are potentially relevant for understanding the emergence of resistance to drugs targeting microtubules, widely used for cancer treatment.",

We examined whether time spent grooming with others in a highly social mammal species was associated with infection status for gastrointestinal parasites.

Individuals infected with Trichuris sp. spent significantly less time grooming conspecifics than those not infected, and time in direct contact with others was the major predictor of infection status. One model correctly predicted infection status for Trichuris sp. with a reliability of 95.17% overall when the variables used were time spent in direct contact and time spent grooming others. This decrease in time spent grooming and interacting with others is likely a sickness behavior displayed by individuals with less energy or motivation for non-essential behaviors.
