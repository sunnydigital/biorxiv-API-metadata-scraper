    "abstract": "1Engineered gene drive techniques for population replacement and/or suppression have potential for tackling complex challenges, including reducing the spread of diseases and invasive species. Unfortunately, the self-propelled behavior of drives can lead to the spread of transgenic elements beyond the target population, which is concerning. Gene drive systems with a low threshold frequency for invasion, such as homing-based gene drive systems, require initially few transgenic individuals to spread and are therefore easy to implement. However their ease of spread presents a double-edged sword; their low threshold makes these drives much more susceptible to spread outside of the target population (spillover). We model a proposed drive system that transitions in time from a low threshold drive system (homing-based gene drive) to a high threshold drive system (underdominance) using daisy chain technology. This combination leads to a spatially restricted drive strategy, while maintaining an attainable release threshold. We develop and analyze a discrete-time model as proof of concept and find that this technique effectively generates stable local population suppression, while preventing the spread of transgenic elements beyond the target population under biologically realistic parameters.",

    "abstract": "Here we present the devised BC-store - a program for analyzing and selecting sets of barcodes for sequencing on platforms manufactured by MGI Tech (China). The app is available as an open source in Python3 and as a desktop version. The application allows analyzing the compatibility of barcodes on a single lane of a flow cell in a set in the case of equal and arbitrary fractions. In addition, with the help of this tool barcodes can be added to an existing set with custom share options. In this paper we describe how BC-store works for different tasks and consider the effectiveness of using BC-store in sequence lab routine tasks.\n\nAuthor summaryThe performance of modern NGS machines allows considerable amount of data to be obtained which exceed the data required for one specific sample. To pool multiple samples on a single lane of the flow cell, barcoding is used - adapters carrying a unique nucleotide sequence are introduced by ligation [1]. Adapters are sequenced from their specific primers. Their sequences are used for demultiplexing the sequencing results for individual fastq files by programs like zebracall [2] or bcl2fastq [3]. The task of selecting the adapters for a set is similar to sequencing low diversity libraries [4]: if all adapters on the lane have the same nucleotide during this sequencing cycle, the quality of its reading drops dramatically. Therefore, manufacturers recommend grouping the adapters by sets. However, the sets offered by MGI Tech [5] are far from routine practice, as they do not allow for non-equimolar sample pooling by default, and they have other disadvantages (more on them later in the text). To overcome these problems, we created the BC-store program, which allows analyzing the sets of MGI Tech barcodes entered by the user to be further used in sequencing. This tool also provides the opportunity to vary the number of simultaneously sequenced samples, to use reagents more efficiently, and, as a result, to correctly distribute reads across samples, which helps to increase both the quality of sequencing and the level of data interpretation.",

    "abstract": "Molecular mechanisms of virus-related diseases involve multiple factors, including viral mutation accumulation and integration of a viral genome into the host DNA. With increasing attention being paid to virus-mediated pathogenesis and the development of many useful technologies to identify virus mutations (VMs) and viral integration sites (VISs), abundant literatures on these topics are available in PubMed. However, knowledge of VMs and VISs is widely scattered in numerous published papers, and the association of VMs with VISs in the viral genome or the functional annotation of VISs still lacks integration and curation. To address these challenges, we built a database of human disease-related Virus Mutations, Integration sites and Cis-effects (ViMIC), which specialize in three features: virus mutation sites, viral integration sites and target genes. In total, the ViMIC provides information on 6,461 VMs, 79,089 VISs, and 15,056 viral target genes of 8 viruses in 65 human diseases obtained from literatures. Furthermore, in ViMIC, users are allowed to explore the cis-effects of virus-host interactions by surveying 78 histone modifications, binding of 1,358 transcription regulators, and chromatin accessibility on these VISs. We believe ViMIC will become a valuable resource for the virus research community. The database is available at http://bmtongji.cn/ViMIC/index.php.",

    "abstract": "In living cells, liquid condensates form in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm via phase separation and regulate physiological processes. They also regulate aberrant aggregation of amyloid fibrils, a process linked to Alzheimers and Parkinsons diseases. In the absence of condensates it has been shown that amyloid aggregation can be inhibited by molecular chaperones and rationally designed drugs. However it remains unknown how this drug- or chaperone-mediated inhibition of amyloid fibril aggregation is affected by phase-separated condensates. Here we study the interplay between protein aggregation, its inhibition and liquid-liquid phase separation. Our key finding is that the potency of inhibitors of amyloid formation can be strongly enhanced. We show that the corresponding mechanism relies on the colocalization of inhibitors and aggregates inside the liquid condensate. We provide experimentally testable physicochemical conditions under which the increase of inhibitor potency is most pronounced. Our work highlights the role of spatio-temporal heterogeneity in curtailing aberrant protein aggregation and suggests design principles for amyloid inhibitors accounting for partitioning of drugs into liquid condensates.",

However, the contributions of chemotherapeutic agents to the mutation burden of healthy cells and to clonal expansions in somatic tissues are not clear. Here, we exploit the mutational footprint of some chemotherapies to explore their influence on the evolution of hematopoietic cells. Cells of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) secondary to treatment with platinum-based drugs showed a clear mutational footprint of these drugs, indicating that healthy blood cells received chemotherapy mutations. In contrast, no trace of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) mutational signature was found in AML secondary to exposure to 5-FU, suggesting that cells establishing the AML were quiescent during treatment. We used the platinum-based mutational signature as a barcode to precisely time clonal expansions with respect to the moment of exposure to the drug. The enrichment for clonal mutations among treatment-related mutations in all platinum-treated AMLs shows that these secondary neoplasms begin their clonal expansion after the start of the cytotoxic treatment. In contrast, the absence of detectable platinum-related mutations in healthy blood samples with clonal hematopoiesis is consistent with a clonal expansion that predates the exposure to the cytotoxic agent, which favours particular pre-existing clones.",

To optimally apply these drugs, information about their tissue-specific disposition is required, and one approach to predict these pharmacokinetic characteristics is physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling. In this study, a whole-body PBPK model was developed to simulate the time-dependent tissue concentrations of artesunate (AS) and its active metabolite, dihydroartemisinin (DHA). The model was developed for both rats and humans and incorporated drug metabolism of the parent compound and major metabolite. Model calibration was conducted using data from the literature in a Bayesian framework, and model verification was assessed using separate sets of data. Results showed good agreement between model predictions and the validation data, demonstrating the capability of the model in predicting the blood, plasma, and tissue pharmacokinetics of AS and DHA. It is expected that such a tool will be useful in characterizing the disposition of these chemicals and ultimately improve dosing regimens by enabling a quantitative assessment of the tissue-specific drug levels critical in the evaluation of efficacy and toxicity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are macronutrients essential for crop growth and productivity. In cultivated fields, N and P levels are rarely sufficient, contributing to the yield gap between realized and potential production. Fertilizer application increases nutrient availability, but not all farmers have access to fertilizers, nor are current rates of application sustainable or environmentally desirable. Transcriptomic studies of cereal crops have revealed dramatic responses to either low N or low P single stress treatments. In the field, however, levels of both N and P may be suboptimal. The interaction between N and P starvation responses remains to be fully characterized.\n\nResultsWe characterized growth and root and leaf transcriptomes of young maize plants under nutrient replete, low N, low P or combined low NP conditions. We identified 1,555 genes to respond to our nutrient treatments, in one or both tissues. A large group of genes, including many classical P starvation response genes, were regulated antagonistically between low N and P conditions. An additional experiment over a range of N availability indicated that a mild reduction in N levels was sufficient to repress the low P induction of P starvation genes. Although expression of P transporter genes was repressed under low N or low NP, we confirmed earlier reports of P hyper accumulation under N limitation.\n\nConclusionsTranscriptional responses to low N or P were distinct, with few genes responding in a similar way to the two single stress treatments. In combined NP stress, the low N response dominated, and the P starvation response was largely suppressed. A reduction in N availability was sufficient to repress the induction of P starvation associated genes. We conclude that activation of the transcriptional response to P starvation in maize is contingent on sufficient N availability.",

However, few studies have directly compared the effectiveness of these strategies in forgetting specific items, and it remains an open question if the neural mechanisms supporting these strategies differ. Here, we developed a novel item-method directed forgetting paradigm with Remember, Forget, and Imagine cues, and recorded EEG to directly compare these strategies. Behaviorally, Forget and Imagine cues produced similar forgetting compared to Remember cues, but through separable neural processes; Forget cues elicited frontal oscillatory power changes that were predictive of future forgetting, whereas item-cue representational similarity was predictive of later accuracy for Imagine cues. These results suggest that both strategies can lead to intentional forgetting, but directed forgetting may rely on frontally-mediated suppression, while thought substitution may lead to contextual shifting, impairing successful retrieval.",

Previous studies have linked infant functional connectivity to cognitive abilities in toddlerhood. However, little is known regarding the long-term relevance of functional connections established in infancy for the protracted development of higher-order abilities of language and literacy. Employing a five-year longitudinal imaging project starting in infancy, this study utilizes resting-state functional MRI to demonstrate prospective associations between infant functional connectivity fingerprints and subsequent language and foundational literacy skills at a mean age of 6.5. These longitudinal associations are preserved when key environmental influences are controlled for and are independent of emergent language abilities in infancy, suggesting early development of functional network characteristics in supporting the acquisition of high-order language and pre-literacy skills. Altogether, the current results highlight the importance of functional organization established in infancy as a neural scaffold underlying the learning process of complex cognitive functions.",

    "abstract": "For individuals with misophonia, specific innocuous sensory stimuli - such as hearing another person chewing or breathing - evoke strong negative emotional and physiological responses, such as extreme anger, disgust, stress and anxiety. Instead people with misophonia do not experience or display atypical reactions to generic aversive sounds such as screams or nails scratching on a blackboard. Misophonia appears to be unrelated to neurological trauma or hearing deficit, and features a characteristic developmental pattern. Its aetiology is currently unknown.\n\nThe few previous fMRI studies on misophonia showed that sufferers feature increased dorsal anterior insula activity during trigger vs. generic aversive sounds. While this effect likely reflects the saliency associated with the perception of trigger sounds in people with misophonia, in the present fMRI study we investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the emotional reaction to trigger stimuli. To this aim, we probe the task-dependent connectivity of mid-cingulate, medial premotor and ventrolateral premotor cortex. We observe that only in participants with misophonia the presentation of trigger audio-visuals prompts an increased interaction of these three brain regions with the lateral orbitofrontal cortex. This brain region is crucial for behavioural inhibition mediated by cognitive and emotional content (such as in reward-reversal learning) and is part of the temporo-amygdala-orbitofrontal network, which integrates visceral and emotional states with cognition and behaviour. We also observe that in people with misophonia trigger sounds prompt a significant increase in the interaction between mid-cingulate and the primary auditory cortex.\n\nOur study replicates previous results and expands the network of brain regions involved in misophonia. The involvement of the orbitofrontal cortex suggests a defective functioning of high-order integrative processes allowing the reappraisal of experience-dependent negative emotional association with harmless sensory stimuli, and sheds light on the mechanisms underlying the compulsive nature of the misophonic reaction. The increased interaction, rather than the overall activity, of the primary auditory cortex with the mid-cingulate supports the hypothesis that the emotional response in misophonia is subserved by an indirect auditory-limbic pathway processing the subjective valence of specific sounds, rather than their physical properties alone.",

The striatum is integral to habit formation, and interspersed throughout the striatum are patches, or striosomes, which are characterized by unique gene expression relative to the surrounding matrix. Recent work has indicated that patches are necessary for habit formation, but how patches contribute to habits remains partially understood. Here, using optogenetics, we modulated striatal patches in Sepw1-NP67 mice during habit formation. We find that patch activation during operant training impairs habit formation, and conversely, that acute patch stimulation after reward devaluation can drive habitual reward seeking. Patch stimulation invigorates general locomotion but is not inherently rewarding. Finally, we use fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to demonstrate that patch stimulation suppresses dopamine release in dorsal striatum in vivo. Overall, this work provides novel insight into the role of the patch compartment in habit formation, and potential interactions with dopamine signaling.",

It has been posited that polarization arises because holding extreme political views satisfies a need for certain and stable beliefs about the world. We examined the relationship between uncertainty tolerance and political polarization using brain-to-brain synchrony analysis, which measured committed liberals and conservatives subjective interpretation of a continuous political narrative. Participants (N=44) watched a political debate while undergoing fMRI. Shared ideology between participants increased neural synchrony in many brain areas including key regions of the valuation and theory-of-mind networks (e.g. temporoparietal junction). The degree of neural synchrony was modulated by uncertainty aversion: Uncertainty-intolerant individuals experienced greater brain-to-brain synchrony with politically like-minded peers and lower synchrony with political opponents. This effect was observed for liberals and conservatives alike. Moreover, increasing neural synchrony between committed partisans predicted subsequent polarized attitude formation about the debate after the scanning session. These results suggest that uncertainty attitudes gate the shared neural processing of political narratives, thereby fueling polarized attitude formation about hot-button issues.",

Examples of possible choices include the motion regression approach used and smoothing and threshold factors applied during the processing pipeline. Although it is possible to perform a multiverse analysis that evaluates all possible analytic choices, this can be computationally challenging and repeated sequential analyses on the same data can compromise inferential and predictive power. Here, we establish how active learning on a low-dimensional space that captures the inter-relationships between analysis approaches can be used to efficiently approximate the whole multiverse of analyses. This approach balances the benefits of a multiverse analysis without the accompanying cost to statistical power, computational power and the integrity of inferences. We illustrate this approach with a functional MRI dataset of functional connectivity across adolescence, demonstrating how a multiverse of graph theoretic and simple pre-processing steps can be efficiently navigated using active learning. Our study shows how this approach can identify the subset of analysis techniques (i.e., pipelines) which are best able to predict participants ages, as well as allowing the performance of different approaches to be quantified.",

    "abstract": "Humans differ in their capability to judge the accuracy of their own choices via confidence judgments. Signal detection theory has been used to quantify the extent to which confidence tracks accuracy via M-ratio, often referred to as metacognitive efficiency. This measure, however, is static in that it does not consider the dynamics of decision making. This could be problematic because humans may shift their level of response caution to alter the tradeoff between speed and accuracy. Such shifts could induce unaccounted-for sources of variation in the assessment of metacognition. Instead, evidence accumulation frameworks consider decision making, including the computation of confidence, as a dynamic process unfolding over time. We draw on evidence accumulation frameworks to examine the influence of response caution on metacognition. Simulation results demonstrate that response caution has an influence on M-ratio. We then tested and confirmed that this was also the case in human participants who were explicitly instructed to either focus on speed or accuracy. We next demonstrated that this association between M-ratio and response caution was also present in an experiment without any reference towards speed. The latter finding was replicated in an independent dataset. In contrast, when data were analyzed with a novel dynamic measure of metacognition, which we refer to as v-ratio, in all of the three studies there was no effect of speed-accuracy tradeoff. These findings have important implications for research on metacognition, such as its measurement, domain-generality, individual differences, and neural correlates.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, research on voice processing, particularly the study of temporal voice areas (TVA), was dedicated almost exclusively to human voice. To characterize commonalities and differences regarding primate vocalization representations in the human brain, the inclusion of closely related primates, especially chimpanzees and bonobos, is needed. We hypothesized that commonalities would depend on both phylogenetic and acoustic proximity, with chimpanzees ranking the closest to Homo. Presenting human participants with four primate species vocalizations (rhesus macaques, chimpanzees, bonobos and humans) and taking into account acoustic distance or removing voxels explained solely by vocalization low-level acoustics, we observed within-TVA enhanced left and right anterior superior temporal gyrus activity for chimpanzee compared to all other species, and chimpanzee compared to human vocalizations. Our results provide evidence for a common neural basis in the TVA for the processing of phylogenetically and acoustically close vocalizations, namely those of humans and chimpanzees.",

    "abstract": "Conservative repair of stalled replication forks is important for the maintenance of a stable genome. However, the mechanisms that regulate repair pathway \"choice\" at stalled mammalian forks remain poorly understood. The Fanconi anemia complementation group M gene, FANCM, encodes a multi-domain scaffolding and motor protein that interacts with several distinct repair protein complexes at stalled forks. Here we use a chromosomally integrated reporter of stalled fork repair, in combination with defined mutations engineered within the endogenous Fancm gene in primary mammalian cells, to study how Fancm regulates stalled fork repair. We identify separation-of-function Fancm mutants, which reveal that distinct repair functions of FANCM are enacted by modular, molecularly separable scaffolding domains. These findings define FANCM as a key mediator of repair pathway choice at stalled replication forks and reveal its molecular mechanism. Notably, a mutation that inactivates the ATPase function of FANCM disables all FANCM-mediated repair functions and appears to \"trap\" FANCM at stalled forks. We find that Fancm null cells do not survive genetic inactivation of Brca1. This synthetic lethal interaction is recapitulated in Fancm ATPase-defective mutants. The ATPase function of FANCM may therefore represent a promising \"druggable\" target for therapy of BRCA1 mutant cancers.",

We developed a cellular model of BBS using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs)-derived hypothalamic arcuate-like neurons. BBS mutations BBS1M390R and BBS10C91fsX95 did not affect neuron differentiation efficiency but caused morphological defects including impaired neurite outgrowth and longer primary cilia. Expression of intact BBS10 normalized cilia length. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of BBS1M390R hypothalamic neurons identified several down regulated pathways including insulin and cAMP signaling, and axon guidance. In agreement with scRNA-seq data, insulin-induced AKT phosphorylation at Thr308 was reduced in BBS1M390R and BBS10c91fsX95 human fibroblasts and iPSC-derived neurons, as well as in BBS10 knockdown iPSC-derived neurons. Overexpression of intact BBS10 fully restored insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in BBS10c91fsX95 neurons. Mutations in BBS1 and BBS10 impaired leptin-mediated p-STAT3 activation in both human primary fibroblasts and iPSC-derived hypothalamic neurons. Correction of the BBS mutation by CRISPR rescued leptin signaling. POMC expression in BBS1M390R and BBS10 C91fsX95 iPSC-derived hypothalamic neurons was downregulated, as was hypothalamic Pomc in BBS1M390R knockin (KI) mice. In the aggregate, these data provide insights into the anatomic and functional mechanisms by which components of the BBsome in CNS primary cilia mediate effects on energy homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "The use of diverse datasets in phylogenetic studies aiming for understanding evolutionary histories of species can yield conflicting inference. Phylogenetic conflicts observed in animal and plant systems have often been explained by hybridization, incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), or horizontal gene transfer. Here, we employed target enrichment data, species tree and species network approaches to infer the backbone phylogeny of the family Caprifoliaceae, while distinguishing among sources of incongruence. We used 713 nuclear loci and 46 complete plastome sequence data from 43 samples representing 38 species from all major clades to reconstruct the phylogeny of the family using concatenation and coalescence approaches. We found significant nuclear gene tree conflict as well as cytonuclear discordance. Additionally, coalescent simulations and phylogenetic species network analyses suggested putative ancient hybridization among subfamilies of Caprifoliaceae, which seems to be the main source of phylogenetic discordance. Ancestral state reconstruction of six morphological characters revealed some homoplasy for each character examined. By dating the branching events, we inferred the origin of Caprifoliaceae at approximately 66.65 Ma in the late Cretaceous. By integrating evidence from molecular phylogeny, divergence times, and morphology, we herein recognize Zabelioideae as a new subfamily in Caprifoliaceae. This work shows the necessity of using a combination of multiple approaches to identify the sources of gene tree discordance. Our study also highlights the importance of using data from both nuclear and chloroplast genomes to reconstruct deep and shallow phylogenies of plants.",

Here, we reanalyzed the previously reported QTLs with increased marker density. The highest LOD score (26.66) peaked at a synonymous coding and splice-site variant, c.753G>A (rs257098870), in the Cdh23 gene on chromosome 10; the c.753G (C3H) allele showed a PPI-lowering effect. Bayesian multiple QTL mapping also supported the same variant with a posterior probability of 1. Thus, we engineered the c.753G (C3H) allele into the B6 genetic background, which led to dampened PPI. We also revealed an e-QTL (expression-QTL) effect imparted by the c.753G>A variant for the Cdh23 expression in the brain. In a human study, a homologous variant (c.753G>A; rs769896655) in CDH23 showed a nominally significant enrichment in individuals with schizophrenia. We also identified multiple potentially deleterious CDH23 variants in individuals with schizophrenia. Collectively, the present study reveals a PPI-regulating Cdh23 variant and a possible contribution of CDH23 to schizophrenia susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "The host range of parasites is an important factor in assessing the dynamics of disease epidemics. The evolution of pathogens to accommodate new hosts may lead to host range expansion, a process the molecular bases of which are largely enigmatic. The fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum parasitizes more than 400 plant species from diverse eudicot families while its close relative, S. trifoliorum, is restricted to plants from the Fabaceae family. We analyzed S. sclerotiorum global transcriptome reprogramming on hosts from six botanical families and reveal a flexible, host-specific transcriptional program driven by core and host-response co-expression (SPREx) gene clusters. We generated a chromosome-level genome assembly for S. trifoliorum and found near-complete gene space conservation in broad and narrow host range Sclerotinia species. However, S. trifoliorum showed increased sensitivity to the Brassicaceae defense compound camalexin. Inter-specific transcriptome analyses revealed a lack of transcriptional response to camalexin in S. trifoliorum and provide evidence that cis-regulatory variation associates with the genetic accommodation of Brassicaceae in the Sclerotinia host range. Our work demonstrates adaptive plasticity of a broad host range pathogen with specific responses to different host plants and demonstrates the co-existence of signatures for generalist and polyspecialist life styles in the genome of a plant pathogen. We reason that this mechanism enables the emergence of new disease with no or limited gene flow between strains and species, and could underlie the emergence of new epidemics originating from wild plants in agricultural settings.",

    "abstract": "MotivationCross-(multi)platform normalization of gene-expression microarray data remains an unresolved issue. Despite the existence of several algorithms, they are either constrained by the need to normalize all samples of all platforms together, compromising scalability and reuse, by adherence to the platforms of a specific provider, or simply by poor performance. In addition, many of the methods presented in the literature have not been specifically tested against multi-platform data and/or other methods applicable in this context. Thus, we set out to develop a normalization algorithm appropriate for gene-expression studies based on multiple, potentially large microarray sets collected along multiple platforms and at different times, applicable in systematic studies aimed at extracting knowledge from the wealth of microarray data available in public repositories; for example, for the extraction of Real-World Data to complement data from Randomized Controlled Trials. Our main focus or criterion for performance was on the capacity of the algorithm to properly separate samples from different biological groups.\n\nResultsWe present CuBlock, an algorithm addressing this objective, together with a strategy to validate cross-platform normalization methods. To validate the algorithm and benchmark it against existing methods, we used two distinct data sets, one specifically generated for testing and standardization purposes and one from an actual experimental study. Using these data sets, we benchmarked CuBlock against ComBat (Johnson et al., 2007), YuGene (Le Cao et al., 2014), DBNorm (Meng et al., 2017), Shambhala (Borisov et al., 2019) and a simple log2 transform as reference. We note that many other popular normalization methods are not applicable in this context. CuBlock was the only algorithm in this group that could always and clearly differentiate the underlying biological groups after mixing the data, from up to six different platforms in this study.\n\nAvailabilityCuBlock can be downloaded from https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/77882-cublock\n\nContactxouse@anaxomics.com, xavier.daura@uab.cat\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at bioRxiv online.",

The method allowed significant squeezing of the proteome-wide analysis to a few minute time frame at the depth of quantitative proteome coverage of 1000 proteins at 1% FDR. In this work, to further increase the capabilities of the DirectMS1 method, we explored the opportunities presented by the recent progress in the machine learning area and applied the LightGBM tree-based learning algorithm into the scoring of peptide-feature matches when processing MS1 spectra. Further, we integrated the peptide feature identification algorithm of DirectMS1 with the recently introduced peptide retention time prediction utility, DeepLC. Additional approaches to improve performance of the DirectMS1 method are discussed and demonstrated, such as FAIMS coupled to the Orbitrap mass analyzer. As a result of all improvements to DirectMS1, we succeeded in identifying more than 2000 proteins at 1% FDR from the HeLa cell line in a 5 minute LC-MS1 analysis.",

    "abstract": "Oogenesis is one of the first processes to fail during aging. In women, most oocytes cannot successfully complete meiotic divisions during the fourth decade of life. Studies of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have uncovered conserved genetic pathways that control lifespan, but our knowledge regarding reproductive aging in worms and humans is limited. Specifically, little is known about germline internal signals that dictate the oogonial biological clock. Here, we report a thorough characterization of the changes in the worm germline during aging. We found that shortly after ovulation halts, germline proliferation declines, while apoptosis continues, leading to a gradual reduction in germ-cell numbers. In late aging stages, we observed that meiotic progression is disturbed and crossover designation and DNA double-strand break repair decrease. In addition, we detected a decline in the quality of mature oocytes during aging, as reflected by decreasing size and elongation of interhomolog distance, a phenotype also observed in human oocytes. Many of these altered processes were previously attributed to MAPK signaling variations in young worms. In support of this, we observed changes in activation dynamics of MPK-1 during aging. We therefore tested the hypothesis that MAPK controls oocyte quality in aged worms using both genetic and pharmacological tools. We found that in mutants with high levels of activated MPK-1, oocyte quality deteriorates more rapidly than in wild-type worms, whereas reduction of MPK-1 levels enhances quality. Thus, our data indicate that MAPK signaling controls germline aging and could be used to attenuate the rate of oogenesis quality decline.",

    "abstract": "1Collective dynamics in multicellular systems such as biological organs and tissues plays a key role in biological development, regeneration, and pathological conditions. Collective tissue dynamics - understood as population behaviour arising from the interplay of the constituting discrete cells - can be studied with on- and off-lattice agent-based models. However, classical on-lattice agent-based models, also known as cellular automata, fail to replicate key aspects of collective migration, which is a central instance of collective behaviour in multicellular systems.\n\nTo overcome drawbacks of classical on-lattice models, we introduce an on-lattice, agent-based modelling class for collective cell migration, which we call biological lattice-gas cellular automaton (BIO-LGCA). The BIO-LGCA is characterised by synchronous time updates, and the explicit consideration of individual cell velocities. While rules in classical cellular automata are typically chosen ad hoc, rules for cell-cell and cell-environment interactions in the BIO-LGCA can also be derived from experimental cell migration data or biophysical laws for individual cell migration. We introduce elementary BIO-LGCA models of fundamental cell interactions, which may be combined in a modular fashion to model complex multicellular phenomena. We exemplify the mathematical mean-field analysis of specific BIO-LGCA models, which allows to explain collective behaviour. The first example predicts the formation of clusters in adhesively interacting cells. The second example is based on a novel BIO-LGCA combining adhesive interactions and alignment. For this model, our analysis clarifies the nature of the recently discovered invasion plasticity of breast cancer cells in heterogeneous environments. A Python package which implements various interaction rules and visualisations of BIO-LGCA model simulations we have developed is available at https://github.com/sisyga/BIO-LGCA.\n\n2 Author summaryPattern formation during embryonic development and pathological tissue dynamics, such as cancer invasion, emerge from individual inter-cellular interactions. In order to study the impact of single cell dynamics and cell-cell interactions on tissue behaviour, one needs to develop space-time-dependent on- or off-lattice agent-based models (ABMs), which consider the behaviour of individual cells. However, classical on-lattice agent-based models also known as cellular automata fail to replicate key aspects of collective migration, which is a central instance of collective behaviour in multicellular systems. Here, we present the rule- and lattice-based BIO-LGCA modelling class which allows for (i) rigorous derivation of rules from biophysical laws and/or experimental data, (ii) mathematical analysis of collective migration, and (iii) computationally efficient simulations.",

    "abstract": "Long Interspersed Nuclear Element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) is a retrotransposable element that autonomously replicates in the human genome, resulting in DNA damage and genomic instability. Activation of L1 in senescent cells triggers a type I interferon response and age-associated inflammation. Two open reading frames encode an ORF1 protein functioning as mRNA chaperone and an ORF2 protein providing catalytic activities necessary for retrotransposition. No function has been identified for the conserved, disordered N-terminal region of ORF1. Using microscopy and NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that ORF1 forms liquid droplets in vitro in a salt-dependent manner and that interactions between its N-terminal region and coiled-coil domain are necessary for phase separation. Mutations disrupting blocks of charged residues within the N-terminus impair phase separation while some mutations within the coiled-coil domain enhance phase separation. Demixing of the L1 particle from the cytosol may provide a mechanism to protect the L1 transcript from degradation.\n\nStatement of significanceOver half of the human genome is comprised of repetitive sequences. The Long Interspersed Nuclear Element-1 (L1) is an autonomous mobile DNA element that can alter its genomic location, resulting in genomic instability and DNA damage. L1 encodes two proteins that are required for this function: the ORF1 RNA chaperone and the enzymatic ORF2. Here, we demonstrate that ORF1 forms liquid-liquid phase separated states in vitro, which is mediated by electrostatic interactions between the conserved, disordered N-terminus and coiled-coil domain. This work provides a framework to explore how L1 phase separation may enhance the ability of the retrotransposable element to colonize the genome by preventing degradation of the L1 transcript and evasion of host immune responses.",

    "abstract": "The K+/Cl- co-transporter KCC2 (SLC12A5) allows mature neurons in the CNS to maintain low intracellular Cl- levels that are critical in mediating fast hyperpolarizing synaptic inhibition via type A {gamma}-aminobutyric acid receptors GABAARs. In accordance with this, compromised KCC2 activity results in seizures but whether such deficits directly contribute to the subsequent changes in neuronal viability that lead to epileptogenesis, remains to be assessed. Canonical hyperpolarizing GABAAR currents develop postnatally which reflect a progressive increase in KCC2 expression levels and activity. To investigate the role that KCC2 plays in regulating neuronal viability and architecture we have conditionally ablated KCC2 expression in developing and mature neurons. Decreasing KCC2 expression resulted in the rapid activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, in mature hippocampal neurons. Intriguingly, direct pharmacological inhibition of KCC2 in mature neurons resulted in the rapid activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. In contrast, ablating KCC2 expression in immature neurons had no discernable effects on their subsequent development, arborization or dendritic structure. However ablating KCC2 expression in immature neurons was sufficient to prevent the subsequent postnatal development of hyperpolarizing GABAAR currents. Collectively, our results demonstrate that KCC2 plays a critical role in neuronal survival by limiting apoptosis, and mature neurons are highly sensitive to loss of KCC2 function. In contrast KCC2 appears to play a minimal role in mediating neuronal development or architecture.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWDopaminergic signaling plays an important role in associative learning including fear and extinction learning. Dopaminergic midbrain neurons encode prediction error-like signals when threats differ from expectations. Within the amygdala, GABAergic intercalated cell (ITC) clusters receive the densest dopaminergic projections, but their physiological consequences are incompletely understood. ITCs are important for fear extinction, a function thought to be supported by activation of ventromedial cluster ITCs that inhibit central amygdala fear output. In mice, we reveal two distinct mechanisms how mesencephalic dopaminergic afferents control ITCs. Firstly, they co-release GABA to mediate rapid, direct inhibition. Secondly, dopamine suppresses inhibitory interactions between distinct ITC clusters via presynaptic D1-receptors. Early extinction training augments both, GABA co-release onto dorso-medial ITCs and dopamine-mediated suppression of dorso- to ventromedial inhibition between ITC clusters. These findings provide novel insights into dopaminergic mechanisms shaping the activity balance between distinct ITC clusters that could support their opposing roles in fear behavior.",

    "abstract": "While SARS-CoV-2 infection has pleiotropic and systemic effects in some patients, many others experience milder symptoms. We sought a holistic understanding of the severe/mild distinction in COVID-19 pathology, and its origins. We performed a whole-blood preserving single-cell analysis protocol to integrate contributions from all major cell types including neutrophils, monocytes, platelets, lymphocytes and the contents of serum. Patients with mild COVID-19 disease display a coordinated pattern of interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression across every cell population and these cells are systemically absent in patients with severe disease. Severe COVID-19 patients also paradoxically produce very high anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and have lower viral load as compared to mild disease. Examination of the serum from severe patients demonstrates that they uniquely produce antibodies with multiple patterns of specificity against interferon-stimulated cells and that those antibodies functionally block the production of the mild disease-associated ISG-expressing cells. Overzealous and auto-directed antibody responses pit the immune system against itself in many COVID-19 patients and this defines targets for immunotherapies to allow immune systems to provide viral defense.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryIn severe COVID-19 patients, the immune system fails to generate cells that define mild disease; antibodies in their serum actively prevents the successful production of those cells.",

    "abstract": "We have previously reported that the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody, STI-2020, potently inhibits cytopathic effects of infection by genetically diverse clinical SARS-CoV-2 pandemic isolates in vitro, and has demonstrated efficacy in a hamster model of COVID-19 when administered by the intravenous route immediately following infection. We now have extended our in vivo studies of STI-2020 to include disease treatment efficacy, profiling of biodistribution of STI-2020 in mice when antibody is delivered intranasally (IN) or intravenously (IV), as well as pharmacokinetics in mice following IN antibody administration. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters were treated with STI-2020 using these routes, and treatment effects on severity and duration of COVID-19-like disease in this model were evaluated. In SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters, treatment with STI-2020 12 hours post-infection using the IN route led to a decrease in severity of clinical disease signs and a more robust recovery during 9 days of infection as compared to animals treated with an isotype control antibody. Treatment via the IV route using the same dose and timing regimen resulted in a decrease in the average number of consecutive days that infected animals experienced weight loss, shortening the duration of disease and allowing recovery to begin more rapidly in STI-2020 treated animals. Following IN administration in mice, STI-2020 was detected within 10 minutes in both lung tissue and lung lavage. The half-life of STI-2020 in lung tissue is approximately 25 hours. We are currently investigating the minimum effective dose of IN-delivered STI-2020 in the hamster model as well as establishing the relative benefit of delivering neutralizing antibodies by both IV and IN routes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCurrent transmission rates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are still increasing and many countries are facing second waves of infections. Rapid SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is often unavailable but could support public health organizations and hospitals in monitoring and determining transmission links. Here we report the use of reverse complement polymerase chain reaction (RC-PCR), a novel technology for WGS of SARS-CoV-2 enabling library preparation in a single PCR saving time, resources and enables high throughput screening. Additionally, we show SARS-CoV-2 diversity and possible transmission within the Radboud university medical center (Radboudumc) during September 2020 using RC-PCR WGS.\n\nMethodsA total of 173 samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March and September 2020 were selected for whole-genome sequencing. Ct values of the samples ranged from 16 to 42. They were collected from 83 healthcare workers and three patients at the Radboudumc, in addition to 64 people living in the area around the hospital and tested by the local health services. For validation purposes, nineteen of the included samples were previously sequenced using Oxford Nanopore Technologies and compared to RC-PCR WGS results. The applicability of RC-PCR WGS in outbreak analysis for public health service and hospitals was tested on six suspected clusters containing samples of healthcare workers and patients with an epidemiological link.\n\nFindingsRC-PCR resulted in sequencing data for 146 samples. It showed a genome coverage of up to 98,2% for samples with a maximum Ct value of 32. Comparison to Oxford Nanopore technologies gives a near-perfect agreement on 95% of the samples (18 out of 19). Three out of six clusters with a suspected epidemiological link were fully confirmed, in the others, four healthcare workers were not associated. In the public health service samples, a previously unknown chain of transmission was confirmed.\n\nSignificance statementSAR-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing using RC-PCR is a reliable technique and applicable for use in outbreak analysis and surveillance. Its ease of use, high-trough screening capacity and wide applicability makes it a valuable addition or replacement during this ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.\n\nFundingNone\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSAt present whole genome sequencing techniques for SARS-CoV-2 have a large turnover time and are not widely available. Only a few laboratories are currently able to perform large scale SARS-CoV-2 sequencing. This restricts the use of sequencing to aid hospital and community infection prevention.\n\nAdded value of this studyHere we present clinical and technical data on a novel Whole Genome Sequencing technology, implementing reverse-complement PCR. It is able to obtain high genome coverage of SARS-CoV-2 and confirm and exclude epidemiological links in 173 healthcare workers and patients. The RC-PCR technology simplifies the workflow thereby reducing hands on time. It combines targeted PCR and sequence library construction in a single PCR, which normally takes several steps. Additionally, this technology can be used in concordance with the widely available range of Illumina sequencers.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceRC-PCR whole genome sequencing technology enables rapid and targeted surveillance and response to an ongoing outbreak that has great impact on public health and society. Increased use of sequencing technologies in local laboratories can help prevent increase of SARS-CoV-2 spreading by better understanding modes of transmission.",

    "abstract": "Gut microbial-derived metabolites have been shown to play key roles in human physiology and disease. However, establishing mechanistic links between gut microbial metabolites and disease pathogenesis in animal models presents many challenges. The major route of absorption for microbe-derived small molecules is venous drainage via the portal vein to the liver. In the event of extensive liver first pass- or presystemic hepatic metabolism, the route of administration of these metabolites becomes critical. Here we describe a novel portal vein cannulation technique using a subcutaneously implanted osmotic pump to achieve continuous portal vein infusion in mice. First, the microbial metabolite trimethylamine (TMA) was administered over 4 weeks and compared to a vehicle control. Using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), an increase in peripheral plasma levels of TMA and its host liver-derived co-metabolite trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) were observed in a sexually-dimorphic manner. Next, 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4-HPAA), a structurally distinct microbial metabolite that undergoes extensive hepatic first pass metabolism, was administered intraportally to examine effects on hepatic gene expression. As expected, there was no difference in peripheral plasma 4-HPAA levels yet liver tissue demonstrated higher levels of 4-HPAA when compared to the control group. More importantly, significant changes were observed in hepatic gene expression using an unbiased RNA sequencing approach. Collectively, this work describes a novel method for administering gut microbe-derived metabolites via the portal vein, mimicking their physiologic delivery in vivo.\n\nImportanceRecent efforts have underscored the importance of the gut microbial community as a meta-endocrine organ impacting host physiology through systemic delivery of gut-microbial metabolites [Brown and Hazen, 2015]. Microbial metabolites are first delivered to the liver via the portal vein following venous drainage of the gastrointestinal tract. This route of absorption is often crucial by allowing the liver to biotransfrom these molecules prior to entering the peripheral circulation. Microbial metabolites are frequently studied in animal models by incorporation into diet or drinking water. This method falls short as inconsistent oral intake, inconsistent gastrointestinal absorption, and further modification of the metabolite by gut microbes yield imprecise levels of drug delivery. In efforts to overcome this, the physiological impact of microbial metabolites is often studied by intermittent exogenous administration of a metabolite in a non-physiologically relevant manner such as intravenous injection, intraperitoneal injection, or subcutaneous administration, all placing a relatively large proportion of the metabolite directly into the peripheral circulation. Although these approaches can effectively raise circulating metabolites levels in some cases, they do not mimic the natural delivery of gut microbial-derived small molecules through the portal circulation to the liver. Here we describe a novel surgical method to continuously deliver precise amounts of gut microbial metabolites intraportally to better recapitulate the natural systemic delivery route of microbial metabolites to the liver. This model will improve the interrogation of gut microbial metabolites and their associations to disease by providing an unmatched level of resolution when manipulating the portal blood metabolome.",

    "abstract": "Wolbachia, a widespread bacterium that can reduce pathogen transmission in mosquitoes, has been detected within populations of Anopheles (An.) malaria vectors. In the An. gambiae complex, the primary vectors in Sub-Saharan Africa, Wolbachia strains are at low density and infection frequencies in wild populations. PCR-independent evidence is required to determine whether Wolbachia strains are true endosymbionts in Anopheles given most studies to date have used nested-PCR to identify strains. Here we report high-density strains found in geographically diverse populations of An. moucheti and An. demeilloni. Fluorescent in situ hybridization localized a heavy infection in the ovaries of An. moucheti and maternal transmission was observed. Genome sequencing of both strains obtained genome depths and coverages comparable to other known infections. Notably, homologs of cytoplasmic incompatibility factor (cif) genes were present indicating these strains possess the capacity to induce the phenotype cytoplasmic incompatibility which allows Wolbachia to spread through populations. The characteristics of these two strains suggest they are ideal candidates for Wolbachia biocontrol strategies in Anopheles.",

BPDCN occurs at least three times more frequently in men than women, but the reasons for this sex bias are unknown. Here, studying genomics of primary BPDCN and modeling disease-associated mutations, we link acquired alterations in RNA splicing to abnormal pDC development and inflammatory response through Toll-like receptors. Loss-of-function mutations in ZRSR2, an X chromosome gene encoding a splicing factor, are enriched in BPDCN and nearly all mutations occur in males. ZRSR2 mutation impairs pDC activation and apoptosis after inflammatory stimuli, associated with intron retention and inability to upregulate the transcription factor IRF7. In vivo, BPDCN-associated mutations promote pDC expansion and signatures of decreased activation. These data support a model in which male-biased mutations in hematopoietic progenitors alter pDC function and confer protection from apoptosis, which may impair immunity and predispose to leukemic transformation.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCESex bias in cancer is well recognized but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely defined.

We then combined physiological experiments and mathematical modeling of the O2 transport pathway to examine links between cardiorespiratory traits and V{square}O2max.\n\nResultsPhysiological experiments revealed that increases in Hb-O2 affinity of red blood cells improved blood oxygenation in hypoxia, but were not associated with an enhancement in V{square}O2max. Sensitivity analyses performed using mathematical modeling showed that the influence of Hb-O2 affinity on V{square}O2max in hypoxia was contingent on the capacity for O2 diffusion in active tissues.\n\nConclusionsThese results suggest that increases in Hb-O2 affinity would only have adaptive value in hypoxic conditions if concurrent with or preceded by increases in tissue O2 diffusing capacity. In high-altitude deer mice, the adaptive benefit of increasing Hb-O2 affinity is contingent on the capacity to extract O2 from the blood, which helps resolve controversies about the general role of hemoglobin function in hypoxia tolerance.",

    "abstract": "People with the genetic disorder cystic fibrosis (CF) harbor lifelong respiratory infections, with morbidity and mortality frequently linked to chronic lung infections dominated by the opportunistically pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. During chronic CF lung infections, a single clone of P. aeruginosa can persist for decades and dominate end-stage CF lung disease due to its propensity to adaptively evolve to the respiratory environment, a process termed \"pathoadaptation\". Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), chronic inflammation and infection of the sinonasal space, is highly prevalent in CF and the sinuses may serve as the first site in the respiratory tract to become colonized by bacteria that then proceed to seed lung infections. We identified three evolutionary genetic routes by which P. aeruginosa evolves in the sinuses of people with CF, including through the evolution of mutator lineages and proliferative insertion sequences and culminating in early genomic signatures of host-restriction. Our findings raise the question of whether a significant portion of the pathoadaptive phenotypes previously thought to have evolved in response to selective pressures in the CF lungs may have first arisen in the sinuses and underscore the link between sinonasal and lung disease in CF.\n\nGraphical abstract and highlightsO_LIPseudomonas aeruginosa undergoes adaptive evolution in the sinuses of people with CF\nC_LIO_LIOver time, pathoadapted strains display early signatures of genome degradation consistent with recent host restriction\nC_LIO_LIMutations previously thought to occur in CF lungs may have first evolved in sinuses\nC_LI\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/359844v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (50K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13b36aborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8230e1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1570c3eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e4e530_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHuntingtons Disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the HTT gene for which no therapies are available. This mutation causes HTT protein misfolding and aggregation, preferentially affecting medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the basal ganglia. Transcriptional perturbations in synaptic genes and neuroinflammation are key processes that precede MSN dysfunction and motor symptom onset. Understanding the interplay between these processes is crucial to develop effective therapeutic strategies to treat HD. We investigated whether protein kinase CK2, a kinase upregulated in MSNs in HD and previously associated with Parkinsons disease (PD), participates in the regulation of neuroinflammation and synaptic function during HD progression.\n\nMethodsWe used the heterozygous knock-in zQ175 HD mouse model and compared that to zQ175 mice lacking one allele of CK2. We performed neuropathological analyses using immunohistochemistry, cytokine proteome profiling, RNA-seq analyses in the striatum, electrophysiological recordings, and behavioral analyses. We also used the murine immortalized striatal cell lines STHdhQ7 and STHdhQ111 and studied the expression of various synaptic genes dysregulated by CK2.\n\nResultsWe showed that CK2 haploinsufficiency in zQ175 mice ameliorated neuroinflammation, HTT aggregation, transcriptional alterations, excitatory synaptic transmission, and motor coordination deficits. RNA-seq analyses also revealed a connection between -syn, a protein associated with PD, and the transcriptional perturbations mediated by CK2 in HD. We also found increased -syn serine 129 phosphorylation (pS129--syn), a post-translational modification linked to -synucleinopathy, in the nuclei of MSNs in zQ175 mice and in patients with HD. Levels of pS129--syn were ameliorated in zQ175 lacking one allele of CK2.\n\nConclusionsOur data demonstrated that CK2 contributes to transcriptional dysregulation of synaptic genes and neuroinflammation in zQ175 mice and its depletion improved several HD-like phenotypes in this mouse model. These effects were related to increased phosphorylation of S129--syn in the striatum of HD mice, suggesting that CK2 contributes to worsening HD by mediating synucleinopathy. Our study highlights a possible convergent mechanism of neurodegeneration between HD and PD and suggests targeting CK2 as a potential therapeutic strategy to ameliorate synaptic dysfunction in HD as well as other neurodegenerative diseases.",

The dominant immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 were targeted to regions spanning the Spike protein, Nucleocapsid, and ORF1ab.

    "abstract": "Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) are emerging as a critical player in type 2 immunity at barrier sites in response to microbial infections and allergen exposures. Although their classical activators are known to be host epithelial-derived alarmin cytokines IL-33, IL-25 or TSLP, it remains elusive whether ILC2 cells can be activated by directly sensing microbial ligands via pattern-recognition receptors such as toll-like receptors (TLRs). Here we report that toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a potent activating receptor of human ILC2. We found that among many microbial ligands examined, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from multiple species of Gram-negative bacteria, was found to potently stimulate human, but not murine ILC2, to proliferate and produce massive amounts of type 2 effector cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. LPS-activated ILC2 also had greatly enhanced the CD40 ligand (CD154) expression and were able to promote the proliferation and antibody production of human B cells in culture. In a humanized mouse model, LPS activated the adoptively transferred human ILC2 in mouse lungs. Both NF-kB and JAK pathways, but not the IL-33-ST2 pathway, were required for LPS to activate human ILC2. RNA-seq data further revealed that LPS induced a large set of genes overlapped significantly with those induced by IL-33. Collectively, these findings support a non-classical mode of activating human ILC2 cells via the LPS-TLR4 signaling axis. Thus, targeting TLR4 signaling pathway might be developed as a new approach by modulating ILC2 activation in treating various type 2 immunity-associated diseases.",

To gain insight in the pulmonary immune response we analysed BALF samples and paired blood samples from 17 severe COVID-19 patients. Macrophages and T cells were the most abundant cells in BALF. In the lungs, both CD4 and CD8 T cells were predominantly effector memory cells and expressed higher levels of the exhaustion marker PD-1 than in peripheral blood. Prolonged ICU stay associated with a reduced proportion of activated T cells in peripheral blood and even more so in BALF. T cell activation in blood, but not in BALF, was higher in fatal COVID-19 cases. Increased levels of inflammatory mediators were more pronounced in BALF than in plasma. In conclusion, the bronchoalveolar immune response in COVID-19 has a unique local profile that strongly differs from the immune profile in peripheral blood.\n\nSummaryThe bronchoalveolar immune response in severe COVID-19 strongly differs from the peripheral blood immune profile.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant morbidity and mortality. Currently, there is a critical shortage of proven treatment options and an urgent need to understand the pathogenesis of multi-organ failure and lung damage. Cytokine storm is associated with severe inflammation and organ damage during COVID-19. However, a detailed molecular pathway defining this cytokine storm is lacking, and gaining mechanistic understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 elicits a hyperactive inflammatory response is critical to develop effective therapeutics. Of the multiple inflammatory cytokines produced by innate immune cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection, we found that the combined production of TNF- and IFN-{gamma} specifically induced inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis, characterized by gasdermin-mediated pyroptosis, caspase-8-mediated apoptosis, and MLKL-mediated necroptosis. Deletion of pyroptosis, apoptosis, or necroptosis mediators individually was not sufficient to protect against cell death. However, cells deficient in both RIPK3 and caspase-8 or RIPK3 and FADD were resistant to this cell death. Mechanistically, the JAK/STAT1/IRF1 axis activated by TNF- and IFN-{gamma} co-treatment induced iNOS for the production of nitric oxide. Pharmacological and genetic deletion of this pathway inhibited pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis in macrophages. Moreover, inhibition of PANoptosis protected mice from TNF- and IFN-{gamma}-induced lethal cytokine shock that mirrors the pathological symptoms of COVID-19. In vivo neutralization of both TNF- and IFN-{gamma} in multiple disease models associated with cytokine storm showed that this treatment provided substantial protection against not only SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also sepsis, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and cytokine shock models, demonstrating the broad physiological relevance of this mechanism. Collectively, our findings suggest that blocking the cytokine-mediated inflammatory cell death signaling pathway identified here may benefit patients with COVID-19 or other cytokine storm-driven syndromes by limiting inflammation and tissue damage. The findings also provide a molecular and mechanistic description for the term cytokine storm. Additionally, these results open new avenues for the treatment of other infectious and autoinflammatory diseases and cancers where TNF- and IFN-{gamma} synergism play key pathological roles.",

We find that net charge modulates the formation, morphology and solvent properties of model Ddx4 condensates in cells and in vitro and that a net negative charge is conserved across germ cell-specific Ddx4 orthologues. This conserved net charge provides a sensitivity to multivalent cations that is not observed in somatic paralogues. The disfavouring effect of a net negative charge in Ddx4 orthologues appears to be offset by increased charge patterning, indicating that fine tuning of both attractive and repulsive interactions can create responsive solvent environments inside biomolecular condensates.",

We find that Rab34 is required for formation of the ciliary vesicle at the mother centriole and that Rab34 marks the ciliary sheath, a unique sub-domain of assembling intracellular cilia. Rab34 activity is modulated by divergent residues within its GTPase domain, and ciliogenesis requires GTP binding and turnover by Rab34. Because Rab34 is found on assembly intermediates that are unique to intracellular ciliogenesis, we tested its role in the extracellular pathway used by MDCK cells. Consistent with Rab34 acting specifically in the intracellular pathway, MDCK cells ciliate independently of Rab34 and paralog Rab36. Together, these findings reveal a new context-specific molecular requirement for ciliary membrane biogenesis.",

How dystrophin absence leads to muscle wasting remains unclear. Here, we describe an optimized protocol to differentiate human induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSC) to a late myogenic stage. This allows to recapitulate classical DMD phenotypes (mislocalization of proteins of the Dystrophin-glycoprotein associated complex (DGC), increased fusion, myofiber branching, force contraction defects and calcium hyperactivation) in isogenic DMD-mutant iPSC lines in vitro. Treatment of the myogenic cultures with prednisolone (the standard of care for DMD) can dramatically rescue force contraction, fusion and branching defects in DMD iPSC lines. This argues that prednisolone acts directly on myofibers, challenging the largely prevalent view that its beneficial effects are due to anti-inflammatory properties. Our work introduces a new human in vitro model to study the onset of DMD pathology and test novel therapeutic approaches.",

Although reproduction and mate choice are key components of vector population dynamics and control, our understanding of the mechanisms of sexual selection in mosquitoes remains poor. In \"good genes\" models of sexual selection, females use male cues as an indicator of both mate and offspring inherent genetic quality. Recent studies in Ae. aegypti provide evidence that male wingbeat acoustics signal aspects of offspring quality and performance during mate selection in a process known as harmonic convergence. However, the extent to which harmonic convergence may signal overall inherent quality of mates and their offspring remains unknown. To examine this, we measured the potential acoustic signaling and heritability of a broad panel of parent and offspring fitness traits in two generations of field-derived Ae. aegypti originating from dengue endemic field sites in Thailand. Our data show that in this population of mosquitoes, harmonic convergence does not signal male fertility, female fecundity, and male flight performance traits, which despite displaying robust variability in both parents and their offspring were only weakly heritable. Together with previous work, our findings suggest that vector reproductive control programs should treat harmonic convergence as an indicator of some, but not all aspects of inherent quality, and that multiple forms of sexual selection are likely at play in Ae. aegypti in a trait, population, and environment dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "Heliconius butterflies (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) are a group of 48 neotropical species widely studied in evolutionary research. Despite the wealth of genomic data generated in past years, chromosomal level genome assemblies currently exist for only two species, Heliconius melpomene and H. erato, each a representative of one of the two major clades of the genus. Here, we use these reference genomes to improve the contiguity of previously published draft genome assemblies of 16 Heliconius species. Using a reference-assisted scaffolding approach, we place and order the scaffolds of these genomes onto chromosomes, resulting in 95.7-99.9% of their genomes anchored to chromosomes. Genome sizes are somewhat variable among species (270-422 Mb) and in one small group of species (H. hecale, H. elevatus and H. pardalinus) differences in genome size are mainly driven by a few restricted repetitive regions. Genes within these repeat regions show an increase in exon copy number, an absence of internal stop codons, evidence of constraint on non-synonymous changes, and increased expression, all of which suggest that the extra copies are functional. Finally, we conducted a systematic search for inversions and identified five moderately large inversions fixed between the two major Heliconius clades. We infer that one of these inversions was transferred by introgression between the lineages leading to the erato/sara and burneyi/doris clades. These reference-guided assemblies represent a major improvement in Heliconius genomic resources that should aid further genetic and evolutionary studies in this genus.",

    "abstract": "The TREK subfamily of Two-Pore Domain (K2P) K+ channels are inhibited by fluoxetine and its metabolite, norfluoxetine (NFx). Although not the principal targets of this antidepressant, TREK channel inhibition by NFx has provided important insights into the conformational changes associated with channel gating and highlighted the role of the selectivity filter in this process. But despite the availability of TREK-2 crystal structures with NFx bound, the precise mechanisms underlying NFx inhibition remain elusive. NFx has previously been proposed to be a state-dependent inhibitor, but its binding site suggests many possible ways in which this positively charged drug might inhibit channel activity. Here we show that NFx exerts multiple effects on single channel behavior that influence both the open and closed states of the channel, and that the channel can become highly activated by 2-APB whilst remaining in the down conformation. We also show that that the inhibitory effects of NFx are unrelated to its positive charge, but can be influenced by agonists such as ML335 which alter filter stability, as well as by an intrinsic voltage-dependent gating process within the filter. NFx therefore not only inhibits channel activity by altering the equilibrium between up and down conformations, but can also directly influence filter gating. These results provide further insight into the complex allosteric mechanisms that modulate filter-gating in TREK K2P channels and highlight the different ways that filter gating can be regulated to permit polymodal regulation.",

    "abstract": "Sea turtle fibropapillomatosis (FP) is a tumor promoting disease that is one of several threats globally to endangered sea turtle populations. The prevalence of FP is highest in green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) populations, and historically has shown considerable temporal growth. FP tumors can significantly affect the ability of turtles to forage for food and avoid predation and can grow to debilitating sizes. In the current study, based in South Texas, we have applied transcriptome sequencing to FP tumors and healthy control tissue to study the gene expression profiles of FP. By identifying differentially expressed turtle genes in FP, and matching these genes to their closest human ortholog we draw on the wealth of human based knowledge, specifically human cancer, to identify new insights into the biology of sea turtle FP. We show that several genes aberrantly expressed in FP tumors have known tumor promoting biology in humans, including CTHRC1 and NLRC5, and provide support that disruption of the Wnt signaling pathway is a feature of FP. Further, we profiled the expression of current targets of immune checkpoint inhibitors from human oncology in FP tumors and identified potential candidates for future studies.",

    "abstract": "Osteocyte produced fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is the key regulator of serum phosphate (Pi) homeostasis. The interplay between parathyroid hormone (PTH), FGF23 and other proteins that regulate FGF23 production and serum Pi levels is complex and incompletely characterised. Evidence suggests that the protein product of the SOST gene, sclerostin (SCL), also a PTH target and also produced by osteocytes, plays a role in FGF23 expression, however the mechanism for this effect is unclear. Part of the problem of understanding the interplay of these mediators is the complex multi-organ system that achieves Pi homeostasis in vivo. In the current study, we sought to address this using a unique cell line model of the osteocyte, IDG-SW3, known to express FGF23 at both the mRNA and protein levels. In cultures of differentiated IDG-SW3 cells, both PTH1-34 and recombinant human (rh) SCL remarkably induced Fgf23 mRNA expression dose-dependently within 3 hours. Both rhPTH1-34 and rhSCL also strongly induced C-terminal FGF23 protein secretion. Secreted intact FGF23 levels remained unchanged, consistent with constitutive post-translational cleavage of FGF23 in this cell model. Both rhPTH1-34 and rhSCL treatments significantly suppressed mRNA levels of Phex, Dmp1 and Enpp1 mRNA, encoding putative negative regulators of FGF23 levels, and induced Galnt3 mRNA expression, encoding N-acetylgalactosaminyl-transferase 3 (GalNAc-T3), which protects FGF23 from furin-like proprotein convertase-mediated cleavage. The effect of both rhPTH1-34 and rhSCL was antagonised by pre-treatment with the NF-{kappa}{beta} signalling inhibitors, BAY11 and TPCK. RhSCL also stimulated FGF23 mRNA expression in ex vivo cultures of human bone. These findings provide evidence for the direct regulation of FGF23 expression by sclerostin. Locally expressed sclerostin via the induction of FGF23 in osteocytes thus has the potential to contribute to the regulation of Pi homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "The adaptation of ganglion cells to increasing light levels is a crucial property of the retina. The retina must respond to light intensities that vary by 10-12 orders of magnitude, but the dynamic range of ganglion cell responses covers only [~]3 orders of magnitude. Dopamine is a crucial neuromodulator for light adaptation and activates receptors in the D1 and D2 families. D1Rs are expressed on horizontal cells and some bipolar, amacrine and ganglion cells. In the D2 family D2Rs are expressed on dopaminergic amacrine cells and D4Rs are primarily expressed on photoreceptors. However, the roles of activating these receptors to modulate the synaptic properties of the inputs to ganglion cells are not yet clear. Here we used single cell retinal patch-clamp recordings from the mouse retina to determine how activating D1Rs and D4Rs changed the light-evoked and spontaneous excitatory inputs to ON-sustained (ON-s) ganglion cells. We found that both D1R and D4R activation decrease the light-evoked excitatory inputs to ON-s ganglion cells, but that only the sum of the peak response decrease due to activating the two receptors was similar to the effect of light adaptation to a rod-saturating background. The largest effects on spontaneous excitatory activity of both D1R and D4R agonists was on the frequency of events, suggesting that both D1Rs and D4Rs are acting upstream of the ganglion cells.\n\nNew and NoteworthyDopamine by bright light conditions allows retinal neurons to reduce sensitivity to adapt to bright light conditions. It is not clear how and why dopamine receptors modulate retinal ganglion cell signaling. We found that both D1 and D4 dopamine receptors in photoreceptors and inner retinal neurons contribute significantly to the reduction in sensitivity of ganglion cells with light adaptation. However, light adaptation also requires dopamine independent mechanisms that could reflect inherent sensitivity changes in photoreceptors.",

    "abstract": "Microorganisms can potentially colonize volcanic rocks using the chemical energy in reduced gases such as methane, hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO). In this study, we analysed soil metagenomes from Chilean volcanic soils, representing three different successional stages with ages of 380, 269 and 63 years, respectively. A total of 19 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were retrieved from all stages with a higher number observed in the youngest soil (1640: 2 MAGs, 1751: 1 MAG, 1957: 16 MAGs). Genomic similarity indices showed that several MAGs had amino-acid identity (AAI) values >50% to the phyla Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, Proteobacteria and Chloroflexi. Three MAGs from the youngest site (1957) belonged to the class Ktedonobacteria (Chloroflexi). Complete cellular functions of all the MAGs were characterised, including carbon fixation, terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, formate oxidation and CO oxidation. All 19 environmental genomes contained at least one gene encoding a putative carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH). Three MAGs had form I coxL operon (encoding the large subunit CO-dehydrogenase). One of these MAGs (MAG-1957-2.1, Ktedonobacterales) was highly abundant in the youngest soil. MAG-1957-2.1 also contained genes encoding a [NiFe]-hydrogenase and hyp genes encoding accessory enzymes and proteins. Little is known about the Ktedonobacterales through cultivated isolates, but some species can utilize H2 and CO for growth. Our results strongly suggest that the remote volcanic sites in Chile represent a natural habitat for Ktedonobacteria and they may use reduced gases for growth.",

    "abstract": "Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is the most common cause of urinary tract infections (UTIs) requiring antibiotic therapy. Recurrent infections, which occur in a quarter of treated individuals, may arise from \"quiescent intracellular reservoirs\" of bacteria that invade deeper layers of the bladder wall following infection and exfoliation of superficial umbrella cells. Here, we present a novel bladder organoid model of UPEC infection that recapitulates the stratified bladder architecture within a small volume suitable for live-cell imaging of host-pathogen dynamics with high spatiotemporal resolution. We confirm that bacteria injected into the organoid lumen rapidly enter superficial cells that resemble umbrella cells and proliferate to generate tightly packed colonies that resemble intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs), a hallmark of UPEC pathogenesis. Unexpectedly, at early stages of infection we detect individual \"solitary\" bacteria that penetrate deeper layers of the organoid wall, where they evade killing by antibiotics and neutrophils. Volumetric serial block face scanning electron microscopy of infected organoids reveals that solitary bacteria can be found throughout the bladder wall and may be intracellular or pericellular (sandwiched between uroepithelial cells). Unlike bacteria within IBCs, which are coccoid-shaped and non-flagellated, solitary bacteria within the bladder wall are rod-shaped and flagellated. We conclude that early invasion of deeper layers of the bladder wall, independent of IBC formation, results in the establishment of reservoirs of solitary bacteria that resist elimination by antibiotics and the host innate immune response.",

    "abstract": "Seagrasses are marine flowering plants that provide critical ecosystem services in coastal environments worldwide. Marine fungi are often overlooked in microbiome and seagrass studies, despite terrestrial fungi having critical functional roles as decomposers, pathogens or endophytes in global ecosystems. Here we characterize the distribution of fungi associated with the seagrass, Zostera marina, using leaves, roots, and rhizosphere sediment from 16 locations across its full biogeographic range. Using high throughput sequencing of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and 18S ribosomal RNA gene, we first measured fungal community composition and diversity, then we tested hypotheses of neutral community assembly theory and the degree to which deviations suggested amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were plant-selected or dispersal-limited, and finally we identified a core mycobiome and investigated the global distribution of differentially abundant ASVs. Our results show that the fungal community is significantly different between sites and follows a weak, but significant pattern of distance decay. Generally, there was evidence for both deterministic and stochastic factors contributing to community assembly of the mycobiome. The Z. marina core leaf and root mycobiomes are dominated by unclassified Sordariomycetes spp., unclassified Chytridiomycota lineages (including Lobulomycetaceae spp.), unclassified Capnodiales spp. and Saccharomyces sp. A few ASVs (e.g. Lobulomyces sp.) appear restricted to one or a handful of locations (e.g. possibly due to local adaptation, deterministic dispersal limitation or seasonal bloom events), while others (e.g. Saccharomyces sp.) are more ubiquitous across all locations suggesting a true global distribution and possible plant-selection. Fungal guilds associated with Z. marina were only weakly identified (10.12% of ITS region and 3.4% 18S rRNA gene ASV guild assignments were considered highly probable) including wood saprotrophs, ectomycorrhizal fungi, endophytic fungi and plant pathogens. Our results are similar to those found for other seagrass species. It is clear from the many unclassified fungal ASVs and fungal functional guilds, that our knowledge of marine fungi is still rudimentary. Further studies characterizing seagrass-associated fungi are needed to understand the roles of these microorganisms generally and when associated with seagrasses.",

How these toxin-bearing organisms avoid autointoxication remains poorly understood. In poison frogs, a Nav DIVS6 pore-forming helix N[-&gt;]T mutation has been proposed as the BTX resistance mechanism. Here, we show that this variant is absent from Pitohui and poison frog Navs, incurs a strong cost that compromises channel function, and fails to produce BTX-resistant channels when tested in the context of poison frog Navs. We further show that captive-raised poison frogs are BTX resistant, even though they bear BTX-sensitive Navs. Hence, our data refute the hypothesis that BTX autoresistance is rooted in Nav mutations and instead suggest that more generalizable mechanisms such as toxin sequestration act to protect BTX-bearing species from autointoxication.",

In Arabidopsis thaliana, transcriptional silencing is performed by the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway. In this process, two specialized RNA polymerases, Pol IV and Pol V, produce non-coding RNAs, which recruit several RNA-binding proteins and lead to the establishment of repressive chromatin marks. An important feature of chromatin is nucleosome positioning, which has also been implicated in RdDM. We show that RdDM affects nucleosomes via the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. This leads to the establishment of nucleosomes on methylated regions, which counteracts the general depletion of DNA methylation on nucleosomal regions. Nucleosome placement by RdDM has no detectable effects on the pattern of DNA methylation. Instead, DNA methylation by RdDM and other pathways affects nucleosome positioning. We propose a model where DNA methylation serves as one of the determinants of nucleosome positioning.",

    "abstract": "Women are underrepresented in the top ranks of the scientific career, including the biomedical disciplines. This is not generally the result of explicit and easily recognizable gender biases but the outcome of decisions with many components of unconscious nature that are difficult to assess. Evidence suggests that implicit gender stereotypes influence perceptions as well as decisions. To explore these potential reasons of womens underrepresentation in life sciences we analyzed the outcome of gender-science and gender-career Implicit Association Tests (IAT) taken by 2,589 scientists working in high profile biomedical research centers. We found that male-science association is less pronounced among researchers than in the general population (34% below the level of the general population). However, this difference is mostly explained by the low level of the IAT score among female researchers. Despite the highly meritocratic view of the academic career, male scientists have a high level of male-science association (261% the level among women scientists), similar to the general population.",

    "abstract": "Whole cell biosensors (WCBs) have become prominent in many fields from environmental analysis to biomedical diagnostics thanks to advanced genetic circuit design principles. Despite increasing demand on cost effective and easy-to-use assessment methods, a considerable amount of WCBs retains certain drawbacks such as long response time, low precision and accuracy. Furthermore, the output signal level does not correspond to a specific analyte concentration value but shows comparative quantification. Here, we utilized a neural network-based architecture to improve the aforementioned features of WCBs and engineered a gold sensing WCB which has a long response time (18 h). Two Long-Short Term-Memory (LSTM)-based networks were integrated to assess both ON/OFF and concentration dependent states of the sensor output, respectively. We demonstrated that binary (ON/OFF) network was able to distinguish between ON/OFF states as early as 30 min with 78% accuracy and over 98% in 3 h. Furthermore, when analyzed in analog manner, we demonstrated that network can classify the raw fluorescence data into pre-defined analyte concentration groups with high precision (82%) in 3 h. This approach can be applied to a wide range of WCBs and improve rapidness, simplicity and accuracy which are the main challenges in synthetic biology enabled biosensing.",

    "abstract": "Proteins that drive processes like clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) are expressed at various copy numbers within a cell, from hundreds (e.g. auxilin) to millions (e.g. clathrin). Between cell types with identical genomes, copy numbers further vary significantly both in absolute and relative abundance. These variations contain essential information about each proteins function, but how significant are these variations and how can they be quantified to infer useful functional behavior? Here, we address this by quantifying the stoichiometry of proteins involved in the CME network. We find robust trends across three cell types in proteins that are sub- vs super-stoichiometric in terms of protein function, network topology (e.g. hubs), and abundance. To perform this analysis, we first constructed the interface resolved network of 82 proteins involved in CME in mammals, plus lipid and cargo binding partners, totaling over 600 specific binding interactions. Our model solves for stoichiometric balance by optimizing each copy of a protein interface to match up to its partner interfaces, keeping the optimized copies as close as possible to observed copies. We find highly expressed, structure-forming proteins such as actin and clathrin do tend to be super-stoichiometric, or in excess of their partners, but they are not the most extreme cases. We test sensitivity of network stoichiometry to protein removal and find that hub proteins tend to be less sensitive to removal of any single partner, thus acting as buffers that compensate dosage changes. As expected, tightly coupled protein pairs (e.g. CAPZA2 and CAPZB) are strongly correlated. Unexpectedly, removal of functionally similar cargo adaptor proteins produces widely variable levels of disruption to the network stoichiometry. Our results predict that knockdown of the adaptor protein DAB2 will globally impact the stoichiometry of most other cargo adaptor proteins in Hela cells, with significantly less impact in fibroblast cells. This inexpensive analysis can be applied to any protein network, synthesizing disparate sources of biological data into a relatively simple and intuitive model of binding stoichiometry that can aid in dynamical modeling and experimental design.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionLarge datasets, consisting of hundreds or thousands of subjects, are becoming the new data standard within the neuroimaging community. While big data creates numerous benefits, such as detecting smaller effects, many of these big datasets have focused on non-clinical populations. The heterogeneity of clinical populations makes creating datasets of equal size and quality more challenging. There is a need for methods to connect these robust large datasets with the carefully curated clinical datasets collected over the past decades.\n\nMethodsIn this study, resting-state fMRI data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study (N=1509) and the Human Connectome Project (N=910) is used to discover generalizable brain features for use in an out-of-sample (N=121) multivariate predictive model to classify young (3-10yrs) children who stutter from fluent peers.\n\nResultsAccuracy up to 72% classification is achieved using 10-fold cross validation. This study suggests that big data has the potential to yield generalizable biomarkers that are clinically meaningful. Specifically, this is the first study to demonstrate that big data-derived brain features can differentiate children who stutter from their fluent peers and provide novel information on brain networks relevant to stuttering pathophysiology.\n\nDiscussionThe results provide a significant expansion to previous understanding of the neural bases of stuttering. In addition to auditory, somatomotor, and subcortical networks, the big data-based models highlight the importance of considering large scale brain networks supporting error sensitivity, attention, cognitive control, and emotion regulation/self-inspection in the neural bases of stuttering.",

    "abstract": "Spatially structured communities of microbes - biofilms - are widespread in nature, and biofilm-dwelling microbes often respond to their environments in ways that are different from their planktonic counterparts. Further, most natural biofilms are multi-species mixtures of microorganisms; the ecology of intra- and inter-species interactions in these consortia, and the resulting effects on total community properties, are often not well understood. A common site of polymicrobial biofilm infections is the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is a genetic disorder in humans that leads to colonization of the lungs by a variety of microorganisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. These opportunistic pathogens are frequently co-isolated from infected lungs, in addition to other infection sites including urinary and intravenous catheters. To study how these microbes behave together in biofilms, we developed a modified artificial sputum medium that is optically clear for use with microfluidic culture. In addition, we engineered strains with optimized fluorescent protein expression constructs allowing for single-cell resolution confocal microscopy. Using these tools and recently developed methods for spatial analysis of 3-D image data, we found that both P. aeruginosa and C. albicans display increased biovolume accumulation in multi-species biofilms relative to single-species biofilms. This pattern did not occur in planktonic co-culture and was thus specific to the biofilm environment. Interestingly, introduction of P. aeruginosa supernatants over dual-species biofilms strongly reduced C. albicans biovolume. This suggests that products that accumulate in batch culture were still inhibitory to C. albicans under a flow regime, but that they their de novo production in mixed species biofilms was not sufficient to inhibit C. albicans biofilm accumulation. Altogether our results indicate a critical impact of flow environment for the outcome of polymicrobial interactions and the need for high-resolution analysis of such communities in future work.",

    "abstract": "Circadian clocks in fungi and animals are driven by a functionally conserved transcription-translation feedback loop. In Neurospora crassa, negative feedback is executed by a complex of Frequency (FRQ), FRQ-interacting RNA helicase (FRH), and Casein Kinase I (CKI), which inhibits the activity of the clocks positive arm, the White Collar Complex (WCC). Here, we show that the period-2 gene, whose mutation is characterized by recessive inheritance of a long 26-hour period phenotype, encodes an RNA-binding protein that stabilizes the ck-1a transcript, resulting in CKI protein levels sufficient for normal rhythmicity. Moreover, by examining the molecular basis for the short circadian period of period-6 mutants, we uncovered a strong influence of the Nonsense Mediated Decay pathway on CKI levels. The finding that circadian period defects in two classically-derived Neurospora clock mutants each arise from disruption of ck-1a regulation is consistent with circadian period being exquisitely sensitive to levels of casein kinase I.",

Inhibition of PAINT decreased cell migration and reduced expression of Slug and Vimentin. Ectopic expression of PAINT suppressed E-cadherin, increased S-phase progression and cell migration. PAINT expression in PCa cells induced larger colony formation and higher expression of mesenchymal markers.

    "abstract": "Bryophytes were among the first plants that colonized earth and they evolved key defense mechanisms to counteract microbial pathogens present in the new environment. Although great advances have been made on pathogen perception and subsequent defense activation in angiosperms, limited information is available in early divergent land plants. In this study, a transcriptomic approach uncovered the molecular mechanisms underlying the defense response of the bryophyte Physcomitrium patens against the important plant pathogen Botrytis cinerea. A total of 3.072 differentially expressed genes were significantly affected during B. cinerea infection, including genes encoding proteins with known function in angiosperm immunity and involved in pathogen perception, signaling, transcription, hormonal signaling, metabolic pathways such as shikimate and phenylpropanoid, and proteins with diverse role in defense against biotic stress. Similarly as in other plants, B. cinerea infection leads to downregulation of genes involved in photosynthesis and cell cycle progression. These results highlight the existence of evolutionary conserved defense responses to pathogens throughout the green plant lineage, suggesting that they were probably present in the common ancestors of land plants. Moreover, several genes acquired by horizontal transfer from prokaryotes and fungi, and a high number of P. patens-specific orphan genes were differentially expressed during B. cinerea infection, indicating that they are part of the moss immune response and probably played an ancestral role related to effective adaptation mechanisms to cope with pathogen invasion during the conquest of land.\n\nKey MessageEvolutionary conserved defense mechanisms present in extant bryophytes and angiosperms, as well as moss-specific defenses are part of the immune response of the early divergent land plant Physcomitrium patens.",

    "abstract": "The unfolded protein response in the endoplasmic reticulum (UPRER) is involved in a number of metabolic diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Here, we characterize the UPRER induced metabolic changes in mouse liver through in vivo metabolic labeling and mass spectrometric analysis of proteome and lipid fluxes. We induced ER stress in vivo via tunicamycin treatment and measured rates of proteome-wide protein synthesis, de novo lipogenesis and cholesterol synthesis serially over a three-day period, thereby generating a metabolic \"signature\" of the UPRER over time. Synthesis of most proteins was suppressed under ER stress conditions, including proteins involved in lipogenesis, consistent with reduced de novo lipogenesis at 48 and 72 hours. Electron microscopy revealed striking morphological changes to ER and H&E staining showed lipid droplet enriched livers under ER stress. Pre-labeling of adipose tissue prior to ER stress induction revealed mobilization of lipids from adipose to the liver. Interestingly, the source of these lipids was uptake of free fatty acids, not whole triglycerides or phospholipids from lipoproteins, as demonstrated by replacement of the triglyceride-glycerol moiety in liver concurrently with increased incorporation of labeled palmitate from adipose. We also induced ER stress by a high-fat diet and observed similar metabolic flux signatures, suggesting that this mechanism may play a role in the progression of fatty liver disease. This flux-based approach provides a powerful tool to identify novel regulators of ER stress and potential targets for pharmacological intervention.",
