    "abstract": "CRISPR/Cas9-mediated beta-globin (HBB) gene correction of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) patient-derived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in combination with autologous transplantation represents a novel paradigm in gene therapy. Although several Cas9-based HBB-correction approaches have been proposed, functional correction of in vivo erythropoiesis has not been investigated. Here, we used a humanized globin-cluster SCD mouse model to study Cas9-AAV6-mediated HBB-correction in functional HSCs within the context of autologous transplantation. We discover that long-term multipotent HSCs can be gene corrected ex vivo and stable hemoglobin-A production can be achieved in vivo from HBB-corrected HSCs following autologous transplantation. We observed a direct correlation between increased HBB-corrected myeloid chimerism and normalized in vivo RBC features, but even low levels of chimerism resulted in robust hemoglobin-A levels. Moreover, this study offers a platform for gene editing of mouse HSCs for both basic and translational research.",

    "abstract": "MutS and its homologues, from prokaryotes to humans, recognize and bind to DNA mismatches generated during DNA replication, initiate DNA mismatch repair and ensures 100-200 fold increase in replication fidelity. In E.coli, through post transcriptional regulation, at least three mechanisms mediate decline of MutS intracellular concentrations during stress conditions. To understand the significance of this multifold regulation, we overexpressed MutS in E.coli and found that it led to impairment of DNA mismatch repair as reflected by preferential accumulation of transition mutations in spontaneous base pair substitution spectrum. This phenomenon was dependent on MutS-mismatch affinity and interaction. Higher MutS overexpression levels promoted DNA double strand breaks, inhibited cell division and resultantly caused a manifold increase in E.coli cell length. This cell division defect involved a novel MutS-FtsZ interaction and impediment of FtsZ ring function. Our findings may have relevance for cancers where mismatch proteins are known to be overexpressed.",

    "abstract": "The current CoVid-19 crisis is revealing the strengths and the weaknesses of the worlds capacity to respond to a global health crisis. A critical weakness has resulted from the excessive centralization of the current biomanufacturing capacities, a matter of great concern, if not a source of nationalistic tensions. On the positive side, scientific data and information have been shared at an unprecedented speed fuelled by the preprint phenomena, and this has considerably strengthened our ability to develop new technology-based solutions. In this work we explore how, in a context of rapid exchange of scientific information, plant biofactories can serve as a rapid and easily adaptable solution for local manufacturing of bioreagents, more specifically recombinant antibodies. For this purpose, we tested our ability to produce, in the framework of an academic lab and in a matter of weeks, milligram amounts of six different recombinant monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in Nicotiana benthamiana. For the design of the antibodies we took advantage, among other data sources, of the DNA sequence information made rapidly available by other groups in preprint publications. mAbs were all engineered as single-chain fragments fused to a human gamma Fc and transiently expressed using a viral vector. In parallel, we also produced the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 N protein and its Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) in planta and used them to test the binding specificity of the recombinant mAbs. Finally, for two of the antibodies we assayed a simple scale-up production protocol based on the extraction of apoplastic fluid. Our results indicate that gram amounts of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could be easily produced in little more than 6 weeks in repurposed greenhouses with little infrastructure requirements using N. benthamiana as production platform. Similar procedures could be easily deployed to produce diagnostic reagents and, eventually, could be adapted for rapid therapeutic responses.",

    "abstract": "Mould is a common phenomenon in stored wheat. First, mould will decrease the quality of wheat kernels. Second, the mycotoxins metabolized by mycetes are very harmful for humans. Therefore, the fast and accurate examination of wheat mould is vitally important to evaluating its storage quality and subsequent processing safety. Existing methods for examining wheat mould mainly rely on chemical methods, which always involve complex and long pretreatment processes, and the auxiliary chemical materials used in these methods may pollute our environment. To improve the determination of wheat mould, this paper proposed a type of green and nondestructive determination method based on biophotons. The specific implementation process is as follows: first, the ultra-weak luminescence between healthy and mouldy wheat samples are measured repeatedly by a biophotonic analyser, and then, the approximate entropy and multiscale approximate entropy are separately introduced as the main classification features. Finally, the classification performances have been tested using the support vector machine(SVM). The ROC curve of the newly established classification model shows that the highest recognition rate can reach 93.6%, which shows that our proposed classification model is feasible and promising for detecting wheat mould.",

    "abstract": "Neural tube closure defects are a major cause of infant mortality, with exencephaly accounting for nearly one-third of cases. However, the mechanisms of cranial neural tube closure are not well understood. Here we show that this process involves a tissue-wide pattern of apical constriction controlled by Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling. Midline cells in the mouse midbrain neuroepithelium are short with large apical surfaces, whereas lateral cells are taller and undergo synchronous apical constriction, driving neural fold elevation. Embryos lacking the Shh effector Gli2 fail to produce appropriate midline cell architecture, whereas embryos with expanded Shh signaling, including the IFT-A complex mutants Ift122 and Ttc21b and embryos expressing activated Smoothened, display apical constriction defects in lateral cells. Disruption of lateral, but not midline, cell remodeling results in exencephaly. These results reveal a morphogenetic program of patterned apical constriction governed by Shh signaling that generates structural changes in the developing mammalian brain.",

    "abstract": "A substantial fraction of the human genome is difficult to interrogate with short-read DNA sequencing technologies due to paralogy, complex haplotype structures, or tandem repeats. Long-read sequencing technologies, such as Oxford Nanopores MinION, enable direct measurement of complex loci without introducing many of the biases inherent to short-read methods, though they suffer from relatively lower throughput. This limitation has motivated recent efforts to develop amplification-free strategies to target and enrich loci of interest for subsequent sequencing with long reads. Here, we present CaBagE, a novel method for target enrichment that is efficient and useful for sequencing large, structurally complex targets. The CaBagE method leverages the stable binding of Cas9 to its DNA target to protect desired fragments from digestion with exonuclease. Enriched DNA fragments are then sequenced with Oxford Nanopores MinION long-read sequencing technology. Enrichment with CaBagE resulted in up to 416X coverage of target loci when tested on five genomic targets ranging from 4-20kb in length using healthy donor DNA. Four cancer gene targets were enriched in a single reaction and multiplexed on a single MinION flow cell. We further demonstrate the utility of CaBagE in two ALS patients with C9orf72 short tandem repeat expansions to produce genotype estimates commensurate with genotypes derived from repeat-primed PCR for each individual. With CaBagE there is a physical enrichment of on-target DNA in a given sample prior to sequencing. This feature allows adaptability across sequencing platforms and potential use as an enrichment strategy for applications beyond sequencing. CaBagE is a rapid enrichment method that can illuminate regions of the  hidden genome underlying human disease.",

    "abstract": "Dendrolimus punctatus is an important pest affecting Masson pine (Pinus massoniana L.) forests and can cause serious economic and ecological losses. WRKY transcription factors play important roles in coping with various environmental stresses. In particular, recent studies have shown that WRKY transcription factors play an important role in plant responses against herbivorous insects. However, the mechanisms underlying the actions of these genes in the defense responses of P. massoniana L. are still unclear. Our previous study provided evidence that WRKY may play an important role in the insect resistance of P. massoniana L. In this study, application of semiochemicals such as exogenous hormones and Ca2+ by spraying increased the concentrations of endogenous hormones, terpenoid synthases, and volatile substances in P. massoniana L. and effectively improved its resistance to D. punctatus. After analyzing the WRKY family of P. massoniana L., the PmWRKY31 gene was selected and studied. Yeast two-hybrid assays showed that the LP8 gene interacted with PmWRKY31. Fluorescence-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed that after treatment with exogenous hormones and Ca2+, the expression levels of the PmWRKY31 gene, hormonal signal-related genes, and terpene biosynthetic pathway-related genes were significantly increased, whereas the expression of the LP8 gene was decreased. Therefore, the PmWRKY31 and LP8 genes affected downstream gene expression by positively and negatively regulating the hormone signaling pathways, respectively. This result provides theoretical support for the involvement of WRKY transcription factors in the insect resistance of P. massoniana L. through their regulation of hormone signaling.",

    "abstract": "Potato cyst nematodes (PCN) from the genus Globodera spp. cause major losses in potato (Solanum tuberosum) industry worldwide. Despite their importance, at present little is known about the status of this plant pathogen in cultivated potatoes in Colombia. In this study, a total of 589 samples collected from 75 geographic localities from nine potato producing departments of Colombia were assayed for the presence of potato cyst nematodes. Fifty-seven percent of samples tested positive for PCN. All populations but one were identified as Globodera pallida, with conspicuous morphometric variation found among populations. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) of the rRNA gene and D2-D3 expansion segments of the 28S rRNA gene, G. pallida from Colombia formed a monophyletic group closely related to Peruvian populations, with the lowest average number of nucleotide substitutions per site (Dxy= 0.002) and net nucleotide substitutions per site (Da= 0.001), when compared to G. pallida populations from South, North America and Europe. A single sample formed a well-supported subclade along with G. rostochiensis and G. tabacum from Japan, USA and Argentina. To our knowledge this is the first comprehensive survey of Globodera populations from Colombia that includes morphological and genetic data. Our findings on species diversity and phylogenetic relationships of Globodera populations from Colombia may help elucidate the status and distribution of Globodera species, and lead to the development of accurate management strategies for the potato cyst nematodes.",

    "abstract": "Speech understanding in noisy situations is compromised in old age. This study investigated the energetic and informational masking components of multi-talker babble noise and their influence on neural tracking of the speech envelope in a sample of healthy older adults. Twenty-three older adults (age range 65 - 80 years) listened to an audiobook embedded in noise while their electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Energetic masking was manipulated by varying the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) between target speech and background talkers and informational masking was manipulated by varying the number of background talkers. Neural envelope tracking was measured by calculating temporal response functions (TRFs) between speech envelope and EEG. Number of background talkers, but not SNR modulated the amplitude of an earlier (around 50 ms time lag) and a later (around 300 ms time lag) peak in the TRFs. Selective attention, but not working memory or peripheral hearing additionally modulated the amplitude of the later TRF peak. Finally, amplitude of the later TRF peak was positively related to accuracy in the comprehension task. The results suggest that stronger envelope tracking is beneficial for speech-in-noise understanding and that selective attention is an important ability supporting speech-in-noise understanding in multi-talker scenes.",

    "abstract": "The HIV-1 epidemic originated from a cross-species transmission of a primate lentivirus from chimpanzees to humans near the turn of the 18th century. Simian immunodeficiency viruses have been jumping between old world monkeys in West/Central Africa for thousands of years. So why did HIV-1 only emerge in the past century? This study examined the replicative fitness, transmission, restriction, and cytopathogenicity of 26 primate lentiviruses. Pairwise competitions of these primate lentiviruses revealed that SIVcpz had the highest replicative fitness in human or chimpanzee peripheral blood mononuclear cells, even higher fitness than HIV-1 group M strains responsible for 37 million infections worldwide. In contrast the \"HIV-2 lineage\" (SIVsmm, SIVmac, SIVagm, and HIV-2) had the lowest replicative fitness. SIVcpz strains were less inhibited by human restriction factors than the \"HIV-2 lineage\" strains, a restriction that was inversely correlated with replicative fitness. SIVcpz from the chimpanzee subspecies Pan troglodytes troglodytes (Ptt) was slightly more fit in human cells than the strains from Pt schweinfurthii (Pts). However, unlike all other primate lentiviruses (including the HIV-2 lineage), SIVcpz was nonpathogenic in human tonsillar tissue and did not deplete CD4+ T-cells, consistent with the slow or nonpathogenic disease observed in chimpanzees. Despite the close phylogenetic relationship between SIVcpz_Ptt and HIV-1, this epidemic was either caused by cross species transmission of a rare, undiscovered SIVcpz strain of higher virulence or higher virulence differentially evolved among HIV-1 subtypes during the human epidemic.\n\nAuthor summaryInvasion of wild animal habitats by humans can have devastating consequences for the human population as evident by the HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 epidemics. With SARS-CoV-2, a recent zoonotic jump, likely from bats, will help to identify a coronavirus progenitor. In contrast, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) jumped into humans over 100 years ago from a possibly extinct sub-species of chimpanzees and/or extinct lineage of SIV. We examined replicative fitness and pathogenesis of 26 different primate lentiviruses in human and chimpanzee primary lymphoid cells from blood and within tonsils. SIV from a specific chimpanzee species and lowland gorillas were the most capable of infecting and replicating in human and chimp lymphoid cells but they did not result in the pathogenesis related to disease in humans. In contrast, SIV from other old world monkeys were pathogenic but could not replicate efficiently in human cells. We propose the main HIV-1 is derived from a distinct jump of a very rare SIV strain in chimps leading to AIDS pandemic.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAnti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests are being increasingly used for sero-epidemiological purposes to provide better understanding of the extent of the infection in the community, and monitoring the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic. We conducted sero-prevalence study to estimate prior infection with with SARS-CoV-2 in Addis Ababa.\n\nMethodsA cross-sectional study was done from April 23 to 28, 2020 among 301 randomly selected residents of Addis Ababa; with no known history of contact with confirmed COVID-19 person. Interviews on socio demographic and behavioural risk factor followed by serological tests were performed for SARS-CoV-2 IgM, and IgG antibodies, using COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette. The test has sensitivity of 87{middle dot}9% and specificity of 100% for lgM; and a sensitivity of 97{middle dot}2% and specificity of 100% for IgG. RT-PCR test was also done on combined nasopharyngeal and oropharengeal swabs as an important public health consideration.\n\nFindingsThe unadjusted antibody-based crude SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was 7{middle dot}6% and the adjusted true SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was estimated at 8{middle dot}8% (95% CI 5{middle dot}5%-11{middle dot}6%) for the study population. Higher sero-prevalence were observed for males (9.0%), age below 50 years (8.2%), students and unemployed (15.6%), those with primary education (12.1%), smokers (7.8%), alcohol consumers (8.6%), chatt-chewers (13.6%) and shish smokers (18.8%). Seroprevalence was not significantly associated neither with socio-demographic not behavioral characteristics. According to the findings, possibly more individuals had been infected in Addis Ababa than what was being detected and reported by RT-PCR test suggestive of community transmission. The use of serological test for epidemiological estimation of the extent of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic gives a more precise estimate of magnitude which would be used for further monitoring and surveillance of the magnitude of the SARS CoV-2 infection.",

Structural information on how proteins form MCS is scarce. We designed an in vitro MCS with two membranes and a pair of tethering proteins suitable for cryo-tomography analysis. It includes VAP-A, an ER transmembrane protein interacting with a myriad of cytosolic proteins, and oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP), a lipid transfer protein that transports cholesterol from the ER to the trans Golgi network. We show that VAP-A is a highly flexible protein, allowing formation of MCS of variable intermembrane distance. The tethering part of OSBP contains a central, dimeric, and helical T-shape region. We propose that the molecular flexibility of VAP-A enables the recruitment of partners of different sizes within MCS of adjustable thickness, whereas the T geometry of the OSBP dimer facilitates the movement of the two lipid-transfer domains between membranes.",

    "abstract": "Blood flow governs transport of oxygen and nutrients into tissues. Hypoxic tissues secrete VEGFs to promote angiogenesis during development and in tissue homeostasis. In contrast, tumors enhance pathologic angiogenesis during growth and metastasis, suggesting suppression of tumor angiogenesis could limit tumor growth. In line with these observations, various factors have been identified to control vessel formation in the last decades. However, their impact on the vascular transport properties of oxygen remain elusive. Here, we take a computational approach to examine the effects of vascular branching on blood flow in the growing vasculature. First of all, we reconstruct the 3D vascular model from the 2D confocal images of the growing vasculature at P6 mouse retina, then simulate blood flow in the vasculature, which is applied for the gene targeting mouse models causing hypo- or hyper-branching vascular formation. Interestingly, hyper-branching morphology attenuates effective blood flow at the angiogenic front and promotes tissue hypoxia. In contrast, vascular hypo-branching enhances blood supply at the angiogenic front of the growing vasculature. Oxygen supply by newly formed blood vessels improves local hypoxia and decreases VEGF expression at the angiogenic front during angiogenesis. Consistent with the simulation results indicating improved blood flow in the hypo-branching vasculature, VEGF expression around the angiogenic front is reduced in those mouse retinas. Conversely, VEGF expression was enhanced in the hyper-branching vasculature in the mouse retina. Our results indicate the importance of detailed flow analysis in evaluating the vascular transport properties of branching morphology of the blood vessels.\n\nAuthor SummaryBlood vessels are important for the transport of various substances, such as oxygen, nutrients, and cells, to the entire body. Control of blood vessel formation is thought to be important in health and disease. In the last decades, various factors which regulate blood vessel branching morphology have been identified. Gene modification of some of these identified factors results in hyper-branching of the vasculature while others cause hypo-branching of the vessel. Given the importance of the transport property of the blood vessel, it is important to examine the effect of these identified factors on the transport property of the affected vascular morphology. In line with these facts, we reconstruct 3D vessel structures from 2D confocal microscopy images. We then simulate blood flow in the structures numerically. Interestingly, our results suggest vessel network complexity negatively affects the blood perfusion efficiency and tissue oxygenation during angiogenesis. Thus, our results highlight the importance of flow analysis considering the detailed 3D branching pattern of the vascular network to quantitatively evaluate its transport properties.",

    "abstract": "MotivationKlebsiella species are increasingly multidrug resistant pathogens affecting human and animal health and are widely distributed in the environment. Among these, the Klebsiella pneumoniae species complex (KpSC), which includes seven phylogroups, is an important cause of community and hospital infections. In addition, the Klebsiella oxytoca species complex (KoSC) also causes hospital infections and antibiotic-associated haemorrhagic colitis. The unsuitability of widely used clinical microbiology methods to distinguish species within each of these species complexes leads to high rates of misidentifications that are masking the true clinical significance and potential epidemiological specificities of individual species.\n\nResultsWe developed a web-based tool, Klebsiella MALDI TypeR, a platform-independent and user-friendly application that enables uploading raw data from MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer to identify Klebsiella isolates at the species complex and phylogroup levels. The tool is based on a database of previously identified biomarkers that are specific for either the species complex, individual phylogroups, or related phylogroups, and is available at https://maldityper.pasteur.fr.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMugwort and house dust mite (HDM) are two of the most common inhalant allergens in Asia; however, whether or not mugwort affects polysensitized HDM+ allergic rhinitis (AR) patients has not been elucidated.\n\nMethodsOverall, 15884 AR outpatients were assessed for clinical status. Amino acid sequences of mugwort were determined by mass spectrometry. Afterward, cross-reactivity between mugwort tropomyosin and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus 10 (Der p10) was analysed by ELISA inhibition and basophils activation experiments. To compare immunologic responses eliciting by two different tropomyosins, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of HDM-monosensitized patients were stimulated by mugwort, HDM, Der p10 and synthetic peptides representing mugwort tropomyosin respectively.\n\nResultsPolysensitized HDM+AR patients were mainly sensitized to cat and mugwort, and the positive rate of monosensitized HDM+AR out-clinic patients was increased during the mugwort pollen season. Mugwort tropomyosin protein had similar structural domains to HDM tropomyosin, Der p10. ELISA inhibition experiment showed synthetic mugwort tropomyosin peptide inhibited IgE binding to Der p10; mugwort tropomyosin peptide activated basophils which were primed by HDM-specific IgE. Unlike HDM and Derp 10, mugwort and mugwort tropomyosin mainly induced IFN-{gamma} and IL-17, release in PBMCs of monosensitized HDM+AR patients, but not IL-5.\n\nConclusionsPan-allergen tropomyosin is a major protein accounting for the cross-reactivity between mugwort and HDM, which reminds HDM+ patients to reduce mugwort exposure in mugwort pollen season in virtue of the tropomyosin induced mild inflammation.",
