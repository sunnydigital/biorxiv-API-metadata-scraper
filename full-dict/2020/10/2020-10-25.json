    "abstract": "Mitochondria control eukaryotic cell fate by producing the energy needed to support life and the signals required to execute programmed cell death. The biochemical milieu is known to affect mitochondrial function and contribute to the dysfunctional mitochondrial phenotypes implicated in cancer and the morbidities of ageing. However, the physical characteristics of the extracellular matrix are also altered in cancer and in aging tissues. We demonstrate that cells sense the physical properties of the extracellular matrix and activate a mitochondrial stress response that adaptively tunes mitochondrial function via SLC9A1-dependent ion exchange and HSF1-dependent transcription. Overall, our data indicate that adhesion-mediated mechanosignaling may play an unappreciated role in the altered mitochondrial functions observed in aging and cancer.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=154 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/979583v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (41K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ecdaceorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1112c32org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6c99a1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1da1e5f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Hypoxic adaptation mediated by HIF transcription factors has been shown to require mitochondria. Current models suggest that mitochondria regulate oxygen sensor (HIF prolyl hydroxylase) activity and HIF1 stability during hypoxia by either increasing mitochondrial peroxide as a second messenger or by serving as oxygen consumers that enhance the kinetics of cytoplasmic oxygen reduction. Here, we address the role of mitochondrial peroxide specifically in regulating HIF1 stability. We use state-of-the-art tools to evaluate the role of peroxide and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) in regulating HIF1 stability. We show that antioxidant enzymes are not homeostatically induced nor are peroxide levels increased in hypoxia. Forced expression of diverse antioxidant enzymes, all of which diminish peroxide, had disparate effects on HIF1 protein stability. Reduction of lipid peroxides by glutathione peroxidase-4 or superoxide by mitochondrial SOD failed to influence HIF1 protein stability. These data showed that mitochondrial, cytosolic and lipid ROS are dispensable for HIF1 stability and should affirm therapeutic efforts to activate the HIF pathway in disease states by HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Auditory de-afferentation, a permanent reduction in the number of innerhair-cells and auditory-nerve synapses due to cochlear damage or synaptopathy, can reliably be quantified using temporal bone histology and immunostaining. However, there is an urgent need for non-invasive markers of synaptopathy to study its perceptual consequences in live humans and to develop effective therapeutic interventions. While animal studies have identified candidate auditory-evoked-potential (AEP) markers for synaptopathy, their interpretation in humans has suffered from translational issues related to neural generator differences, unknown hearing-damage histopathologies or lack of measurement sensitivity. To render AEP-based markers of synaptopathy more sensitive and differential to the synaptopathy aspect of sensorineural hearing loss, we followed a combined computational and experimental approach. Starting from the known characteristics of auditory-nerve physiology, we optimized the stimulus envelope to stimulate the available auditory-nerve population optimally and synchronously to generate strong envelope-following-responses (EFRs). We further used model simulations to explore which stimuli evoked a response that was sensitive to synaptopathy, while being maximally insensitive to possible co-existing outer-hair-cell pathologies. We compared the model-predicted trends to AEPs recorded in younger and older listeners (N=44, 24f) who had normal or impaired audiograms with suspected age-related synaptopathy in the older cohort. We conclude that optimal stimulation paradigms for EFR-based quantification of synaptopathy should have sharply rising envelope shapes, a minimal plateau duration of 1.7-2.1 ms for a 120-Hz modulation rate, and inter-peak intervals which contain near-zero amplitudes. From our recordings, the optimal EFR-evoking stimulus had a rectangular envelope shape with a 25% duty cycle and a 95% modulation depth. Older listeners with normal or impaired audiometric thresholds showed significantly reduced EFRs, which were consistent with how (age-induced) synaptopathy affected these responses in the model.\n\nSignificance StatementCochlear synaptopathy was in 2009 identified as a new form of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) that also affects primates and humans. However, clinical practice does not routinely screen for synaptopathy, and hence its consequences for degraded sound and speech perception remain unclear. Cochlear synaptopathy may thus remain undiagnosed and untreated in the aging population who often report self-reported hearing difficulties. To enable an EEG-based differential diagnosis of synaptopathy in humans, it is crucial to develop a recording method that evokes a robust response and emphasizes inter-individual differences. These differences should reflect the synaptopathy aspect of SNHL, while being insensitive to other aspects of SNHL (e.g. outer-hair-cell damage). This study uniquely combines computational modeling with experiments in normal and hearing-impaired listeners to design an EFR stimulation and recording paradigm that can be used for the diagnosis of synaptopathy in humans.",

    "abstract": "Single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) of molecular motors provides transformative insights into their dynamics and conformational changes both at high temporal and spatial resolution simultaneously. However, a key challenge of such FRET investigations is to observe a molecule in action for long enough without restricting its natural function. The Anti-Brownian ELectrokinetic Trap (ABEL trap) sets out to combine smFRET with molecular confinement to enable observation times of up to several seconds while removing any requirement of tethered surface attachment of the molecule in question. In addition, the ABEL traps inherent ability to selectively capture FRET active molecules accelerates the data acquisition process. In this work we exemplify the capabilities of the ABEL trap in performing extended timescale smFRET measurements on the molecular motor Rep, which is crucial for removing protein blocks ahead of the advancing DNA replication machinery and for restarting stalled DNA replication. We are able to monitor single Rep molecules up to 6 s with sub-millisecond time resolution capturing multiple conformational switching events during the observation time. Here we provide a step-by-step guide for the rational design, construction and implementation of the ABEL trap for smFRET detection of Rep in vitro. We include details of how to model the electric potential at the trap site and use Hidden Markov analysis of the smFRET trajectories.",

    "abstract": "The intrinsic genetic programme of a cell is not sufficient to explain all of the cells activities. External mechanical stimuli are increasingly recognized as determinants of cell behaviour. In the epithelial folding event that constitutes the beginning of gastrulation in Drosophila, the genetic programme of the future mesoderm leads to the establishment of a contractile actomyosin network that triggers apical constriction of cells, and thereby, tissue folding. However, some cells do not constrict but instead stretch, even though they share the same genetic programme as their constricting neighbours. We show here that tissue-wide interactions force these cells to expand even when an otherwise sufficient amount of apical, active actomyosin is present. Models based on contractile forces and linear stress-strain responses do not reproduce experimental observations, but simulations in which cells behave as ductile materials with non-linear mechanical properties do. Our models show that this behaviour is a general emergent property of actomyosin networks [in a supracellular context, in accordance with our experimental observations of actin reorganisation within stretching cells.",

    "abstract": "Missing genotypes can affect the efficacy of machine learning approaches to identify the risk genetic variants of common diseases and traits. The problem occurs when genotypic data are collected from different experiments with different DNA microarrays, each being characterised by its pattern of uncalled (missing) genotypes. This can prevent the machine learning classifier from assigning the classes correctly. To tackle this issue, we used well-developed notions of object-attribute biclusters and formal concepts that correspond to dense subrelations in the binary relation patients x SNPs. The paper contains experimental results on applying a biclustering algorithm to a large real-world dataset collected for studying the genetic bases of ischemic stroke. The algorithm could identify large dense biclusters in the genotypic matrix for further processing, which in return significantly improved the quality of machine learning classifiers. The proposed algorithm was also able to generate biclusters for the whole dataset without size constraints in comparison to the In-Close4 algorithm for generation of formal concepts.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria use intercellular signaling, or quorum sensing (QS), to share information and respond collectively to aspects of their surroundings. The autoinducers that carry this information are exposed to the external environment; consequently, they are affected by factors such as removal through fluid flow, a ubiquitous feature of bacterial habitats ranging from the gut and lungs to lakes and oceans. To understand how QS genetic architectures in cells promote appropriate populationlevel phenotypes throughout the bacterial life cycle requires knowledge of how these architectures determine the QS response in realistic spatiotemporally varying flow conditions. Here, we develop and apply a general theory that identifies and quantifies the conditions required for QS activation in fluid flow by systematically linking cell- and population-level genetic and physical processes. We predict that, when a subset of the population meets these conditions, cell-level positive feedback promotes a robust collective response by overcoming flow-induced autoinducer concentration gradients. By accounting for a dynamic flow in our theory, we predict that positive feedback in cells acts as a low-pass filter at the population level in oscillatory flow, allowing a population to respond only to changes in flow that occur over slow enough timescales. Our theory is readily extendable, and provides a framework for assessing the functional roles of diverse QS network architectures in realistic flow conditions.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 alongside the outbreaks of SARS in 2003 and MERS in 2012 underscore the significance to understand betacoronaviruses as a global health challenge. SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent for COVID-19, has infected more than 29 million individuals worldwide with nearly ~1 million fatalities. Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 initiates viral pathogenesis is of the utmost importance for development of antiviral drugs. Autophagy modulators have emerged as potential therapeutic candidates against SARS-CoV-2 but recent clinical setbacks underline the urgent need for better understanding the mechanism of viral subversion of autophagy. Using murine hepatitis virus-A59 (MHV-A59) as a model betacoronavirus, time-course infections revealed a significant loss in the protein level of ULK1, a canonical autophagy regulating serine-threonine kinase, and the concomitant appearance of a possible cleavage fragment. To investigate whether virus-encoded proteases target this protein, we conducted in vitro and cellular cleavage assays and identified ULK1 as a novel bona fide substrate of SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro). Mutagenesis studies discovered that ULK1 is cleaved at a conserved PLpro recognition sequence (LGGG) after G499, separating its N-terminal kinase domain from the C-terminal substrate recognition region. Consistent with this, over-expression of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro is sufficient to impair starvation-induced canonical autophagy and disrupt formation of ULK1-ATG13 complex. Finally, we demonstrated a dual role for ULK1 in MHV-A59 replication, serving a pro-viral functions during early replication that is inactivated at late stages of infection.

    "abstract": "Orphan species that are evolutionarily distant from their closest sequenced/assembled neighbour provide a significant challenge in terms of gene or transcript assembly for functional analysis. This is because 30% sequence divergence from the closest available reference sequence means that, even with a complete genome or transcriptome sequence, mapping-based or reference-based approaches to gene assembly and gene identification break down.\n\nA new approach is required for reference-guided gene and transcript assembly in such orphan species, or species that are evolutionarily very divergent from their closest relatives. When annotating genes, the protein sequence is often preferred as it diverges less than the DNA/RNA sequence and it is often simpler to find meaningful homology at the protein level. This greater conservation of protein sequence across evolutionary time also makes proteins a prime candidate for use as the basis for sequence assembly. A protein-based pipeline was developed for transcript assembly between distantly related species. This was tested on three evolutionarily divergent species with little sequence information available for them and for which the closest genome representatives were at least 40 million years divergent as well as one species (Azolla filiculoides) for which a genome assembly is available. All the species have the potential to be weeds and herbicide targets were chosen as functional genes, whilst low copy number genes were chosen for evolutionary studies. Transcriptomic sequences were assembled using a bait and assemble strategy and final assemblies were verified by direct sequencing.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionTuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally, responsible for an estimated annual 10.0 million new cases and 1.3 million deaths among infectious diseases with Africa contributing a quarter of these cases in 2019. Classification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) strains is important in understanding their geographical predominance and pathogenicity. Different studies have gone ahead to classify MTB using different methods. Some of these include; RFLP, spoligotyping, MIRU-VNTR and SNP set based phylogeny. The SNP set based classification has been found to be in concordance with the region of difference (RD) analysis of MTB complex classification system. In Uganda, the most common cause of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is Uganda genotype of MTB and accounts for up to 70 % of isolates.\n\nMethodsSequenced MTB genome samples were retrieved from NCBI and others from local sequencing projects. The genomes were subjected to snippy (a rapid haploid variant calling and core genome alignment) to call variants and annotate them. Outputs from snippy were used to classify the isolates into Uganda genotypes and Non Ugandan genotypes based on 62 SNP set. The Ugandan genotype isolates were later subjected to 413 SNP set and then to a pan genome wide association analysis.\n\nResults6 Uganda genotype isolates were found not to classify as either Uganda I or II genotypes based on the 62 SNP set. Using the 413 SNP set, the 6 Uganda genotype isolates were found to have only one SNP out of the 7 SNPs that classify the Uganda I genotypes. They were also found to have both missense and frameshift mutations within the ctpH gene whereas the rest of Uganda I that had a mutation within this gene, was a missense.\n\nConclusionAmong the Uganda genotypes genomes, Uganda I genomes are unstable. We used publicly available datasets to perform analysis like mapping, variant calling, mixed infection, pan-genome analysis to investigate and compare evolution of the Ugandan genotype.",

We identify the contributions of mutational processes to each oncogenic variant, quantifying responsibility for origination of changes at oncogenic variant sites contributing to tumorigenesis in 23 cancer types. We demonstrate that the variants driving melanomas and lung cancers are predominantly attributable to the actionable, preventable, exogenous mutational processes of ultraviolet light and tobacco exposure, whereas gliomas and prostate adenocarcinomas are largely attributable to endogenous processes associated with aging. Preventable mutations associated with pathogen exposure and APOBEC activity account for a large proportion of the cancer effect within head and neck, bladder, cervical, and breast cancers. These attributions complement epidemiological approaches--revealing the burden of cancer driven by single-nucleotide variants caused by either endogenous or exogenous, non-actionable or actionable processes, and crucially inform cancer prevention.",

In this study, we systemically investigated A. annua L. for its antimicrobial activity and assessed it as a source of bioactive natural products for anti-mycobacterial activity.\n\nWe used a silica gel column to perform antimicrobial activity-guided purification of the A. annua leaf, whose identity was confirmed by rbcL DNA barcoding, and used UHPLC-HRMS and NMR to elucidate the structure of purified active compounds. The antimicrobial activity of crude extracts, isolated compounds and the control artemisinin (Apollo Scientific Ltd) was assessed against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Mycobacterium smegmatis strains by serial micro dilution method (31.25-1000 g/mL). The isolated compounds were tested for synergistic effects against mycobacterium.\n\nBioactive compounds were purified and identified as deoxyartemisinin and artemisinic acid. Artemisinic acid (MIC 250 g/mL) was more effective in comparison to deoxyartemisinin (MIC 500 g/mL) and artemisinin (MIC 1000 g/mL) against M. smegmatis. We used a molecular docking approach to investigate the interactions between selected anti-mycobacterial compounds and proteins involved in vital physiological functions in M. tuberculosis, namely MtPks13, MtPknB, MtPanK, MtKasA, MtInhA and MtDprE1 and found artemisinic acid showed docking scores superior to the control inhibiters for MtKasA, suggesting it to be a potential nick for further in vitro biological evaluation and anti-TB drug design.",

The diversity of leaf shape, and the range of applications for data on this trait, requires frequent methodological developments so that researchers have an up-to-date toolkit with which to quantify leaf shape. We generated a dataset of 468 leaves produced by Ginkgo biloba, and 24 fossil leaves produced by evolutionary relatives of extant Ginkgo. We quantified the shape of each leaf by developing a geometric method based on elastic curves and a topological method based on persistent homology. Our geometric method indicates that shape variation in our modern sample is dominated by leaf size, furrow depth, and the angle of the two lobes at the base of the leaf that is also related to leaf width. Our topological method indicates that shape variation in our modern sample is dominated by leaf size and furrow depth. We have applied both methods to modern and fossil material: the methods are complementary, identifying similar primary patterns of variation, but also revealing some different aspects of morphological variation. Our topological approach distinguishes long-shoot leaves from short-shoot leaves and both methods indicate that leaf shape influences or is at least related to leaf area.",

    "abstract": "The chemical master equation and the Gillespie algorithm are widely used to model the reaction kinetics inside living cells. It is thereby assumed that cell growth and division can be modelled through effective dilution reactions and extrinsic noise sources. We here re-examine these paradigms through developing an analytical agent-based framework of growing and dividing cells accompanied by an exact simulation algorithm, which allows us to quantify the dynamics of virtually any intracellular reaction network affected by stochastic cell size control and division noise. We find that the solution of the chemical master equation - including static extrinsic noise - exactly agrees with the agent-based formulation when the network under study exhibits stochastic concentration homeostasis, a novel condition that generalises concentration homeostasis in deterministic systems to higher order moments and distributions. We illustrate stochastic concentration homeostasis for a range of common gene expression networks. When this condition is not met, we demonstrate by extending the linear noise approximation to agent-based models that the dependence of gene expression noise on cell size can qualitatively deviate from the chemical master equation. Surprisingly, the total noise of the agent-based approach can still be well approximated by extrinsic noise models.",

However, the fundamental cellular, molecular, and mechanistic bases of ultrasonic neuromodulation are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate ultrasound activation of the mechanosensitive K+ channel TRAAK with sub-millisecond kinetics to an extent comparable to canonical mechanical activation. Single channel recordings reveal a common basis for ultrasonic and mechanical activation with stimulus-graded destabilization of long-duration closures and promotion of full conductance openings. Ultrasonic energy is transduced to TRAAK directly through the membrane in the absence of other cellular components, likely increasing membrane tension to promote channel opening. We further demonstrate ultrasonic modulation of neuronally expressed TRAAK. These results suggest mechanosensitive channels underlie physiological responses to ultrasound and provides a framework for developing channel-based sonogentic actuators for acoustic neuromodulation of genetically targeted cells.",

    "abstract": "Homeostatic plasticity plays important roles in regulating synaptic and intrinsic neuronal function to stabilize output following perturbations to circuit activity. In glaucoma, a neurodegenerative disease of the visual system commonly associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), early disease is associated with altered synaptic inputs to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), changes in RGC intrinsic excitability, and deficits in optic nerve transport and energy metabolism. These early functional changes can precede RGC degeneration and are likely to alter RGC outputs to their target structures in the brain and thereby trigger homeostatic changes in synaptic and neuronal properties in those brain regions. In this study, we sought to determine whether and how neuronal and synaptic function is altered in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), an important RGC projection target in the thalamus, and how functional changes relate to IOP. We accomplished this using patch-clamp recordings from thalamocortical (TC) relay neurons in the dLGN in two established mouse models of glaucoma - the DBA/2J (D2) genetic mouse model and an inducible glaucoma model with intracameral microbead injections to elevate IOP. We found that the intrinsic excitability of TC neurons was enhanced in D2 mice and these functional changes were mirrored in recordings of TC neurons from microbead-injected mice. Notably, many neuronal properties were correlated with IOP in older D2 mice, but not younger D2 mice or microbead-injected mice. The frequency of miniature excitatory synaptic currents (mEPSCs) was reduced in both ages of D2 mice, and vGlut2 staining of RGC synaptic terminals was reduced in an IOP-dependent manner in older D2 mice. Among D2 mice, functional changes observed in younger mice without elevated IOP were distinct from those observed in older mice with elevated IOP and RGC degeneration, suggesting that glaucoma-associated changes to neurons in the dLGN might represent a combination of stabilizing/homeostatic plasticity at earlier stages and pathological dysfunction at later stages.",

    "abstract": "Adversity early in life substantially impacts prefrontal cortex (PFC) development and vulnerability to later-life psychopathology. Importantly, repeated adverse experiences throughout childhood increase the risk for PFC-mediated behavioral deficits more commonly in women. Evidence from animal models points to effects of adversity on later-life neural and behavioral dysfunction; however, few studies have investigated the neurobiological underpinnings of sex-specific, long term consequences of multiple developmental stressors. We modeled early life adversity in rats via maternal separation (postnatal day (P)2-20) and juvenile social isolation (P21-35). Adult (P85) male and female rats were assessed for differences in the presence and structural integrity of PFC perineuronal nets (PNNs) enwrapping parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons. PNNs are extracellular matrix structures formed during critical periods in postnatal development that play a key role in the plasticity of PV cells. Females - but not males - exposed to multiple hits of adversity demonstrated a reduction in PFC PV cells in adulthood. We also observed a sex-specific, potentiated reduction in PV+ PNN structural integrity. Moreover, correlations between neural disruption and hyperactivity/risk-assessment behavior were altered by adversity differently in males and females. These findings suggest a sex-specific impact of repeated adversity on neurostructural development and implicate PNNs as a contributor to associated behavioral dysfunction.",

In meropenem-resistant bacteria of the family Enterobacteriales, NDM-1 is considerably more common than IMP-1, despite both metallo-{beta}-lactamases (MBLs) hydrolysing meropenem with almost identical kinetics. We show that blaNDM-1 consistently confers meropenem resistance in wild-type Enterobacteriales, but blaIMP-1 does not. The reason is higher blaNDM-1 expression because of its stronger promoter. However, the cost of meropenem resistance is reduced fitness of blaNDM-1 positive Enterobacteriales because of amino acid starvation. In parallel, from a clinical case, we identified multiple Enterobacter spp. isolates carrying a plasmid-encoded blaNDM-1 having a modified promoter region. This modification lowered MBL production to a level associated with zero fitness cost but, consequently, the isolates were not meropenem resistant. However, we identified a Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate from this same clinical case carrying the same blaNDM-1 plasmid. This isolate was meropenem resistant despite low-level NDM-1 production because of a ramR mutation, reducing envelope permeability. Overall, therefore, we show how the resistance/fitness trade-off for MBL carriage can be resolved. The result is sporadic emergence of meropenem resistance in a clinical setting.",

A complete understanding of their antimicrobial activity is required before these molecules can be used in therapy. Lysozyme coated Ag NPs were synthesized and characterized by TEM-EDS, XRD, UV-vis, FTIR spectroscopy, zeta potential and oxidative potential assay. Biochemical assays and deep level transcriptional analysis using RNA sequencing were used to decipher how Ag NPs exert their antibacterial action against multi-drug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae MGH78578. RNAseq data revealed that Ag NPs induced a triclosan-like bactericidal mechanism responsible for the inhibition of the type II fatty acid biosynthesis. Additionally, released Ag+ generated oxidative stress both extra- and intracellularly in K. pneumoniae. The data showed that triclosan-like activity and oxidative stress cumulatively underpinned the antibacterial activity of Ag NPs. This result was confirmed by the analysis of the bactericidal effect of Ag NPs against the isogenic K. pneumoniae MGH78578{Delta} soxS mutant, which exhibits a compromised oxidative stress response compared to the wild type. Silver nanoparticles induce a triclosan-like antibacterial action mechanism in multi-drug resistant K. pneumoniae. This study extends our understanding of anti-Klebsiella mechanisms associated with exposure to Ag NPs. This allowed us to model how bacteria might develop resistance against silver nanoparticles, should the latter be used in therapy.",

The genus Psychrobacter (family Moraxellaceae, phylum Gamma-Proteobacteria) includes species inhabiting diverse and mostly polar environments, such as sea ice and marine animals. To probe Psychrobacters evolutionary history, we analyzed 85 Psychrobacter strains by comparative genomics and phenotyping under 24 different growth conditions. Genome-based phylogeny shows Psychrobacter are derived from Moraxella, which are warm-adapted pathobionts. Psychrobacter strains form two ecotypes based on growth temperature: flexible (FE, growth at 4 - 37{degrees}C), and restricted (RE, 4 - 25{degrees}C). FE strains, which can be either phylogenetically basal or derived, have smaller genomes and higher transposon copy numbers. RE strains have larger genomes, and show genomic adaptations towards a psychrophilic lifestyle and are phylogenetically derived only. We then assessed Psychrobacter abundance in 86 mostly wild polar bear stools and tested persistence of select strains in germfree mice. Psychrobacter (both FE and RE) was enriched in stool of polar bears feeding on mammals, but only FE strains persisted in germfree mice. Together these results indicate growth at 37{degrees}C is ancestral in Psychrobacter, lost in many derived species, and likely necessary to colonize the mammalian gut.",

    "abstract": "The use of sensitive methods is key for the detection of target taxa, from trace amounts of environmental DNA (eDNA) in a sample. In this context, digital PCR (dPCR) enables direct quantification and is commonly perceived as more sensitive than endpoint PCR. However, endpoint PCR coupled with capillary electrophoresis (celPCR) potentially embodies a viable alternative as it quantitatively measures signal strength in Relative Fluorescence Units (RFU). Provided comparable levels of sensitivity are reached, celPCR permits the development of cost-efficient multiplex PCRs, enabling the simultaneous detection of several target taxa.\n\nHere, we compared the sensitivity of singleplex and multiplex celPCR to dPCR for species-specific primer pairs amplifying mitochondrial DNA (COI) of fish species occurring in European freshwaters by analysing dilution series of DNA extracts and field-collected water samples. Both singleplex and multiplex celPCR and dPCR displayed comparable sensitivity with reliable positive amplifications starting at two to 10 target DNA copies per {micro}l DNA extract. celPCR was suitable for quantifying target DNA and direct inference of DNA concentrations from RFU was possible after accounting for primer effects. Furthermore, multiplex celPCRs and dPCRs were successfully used for the detection and quantification of fish-eDNA in field-collected water samples, confirming the results of the dilution series experiment and exemplifying the high sensitivity of the two approaches.\n\nThe possibility of detection and quantification via multiplex celPCR is appealing for the cost-efficient screening of high sample numbers. The present results confirm the sensitivity of this approach thus enabling its application for future eDNA-based monitoring efforts.",

    "abstract": "N-myristoylation refers to the attachment of a 14-carbon fatty acid onto the N-terminal glycine residue of a target protein. The myristoylation reaction, catalyzed by N-myristoyltrasnferase (NMT), is essential for regulating cellular activities such as signal transduction, proliferation, migration, differentiation, and transformation. Although a considerable amount of research is performed on the overexpression of NMT in pathogenic conditions, a fundamental knowledge gap exists on the evolution of NMT and the functional impact of myristoylation for normal cellular development and functions. We performed evolutionary analyses of the NMT gene and found that most non-vertebrates harbor a single nmt gene and all vertebrates examined harbor two genes; nmt1 and nmt2. For the first time, we report that teleosts harbor two copies of nmt1, named nmt1a and nmt1b. We traced the evolutionary history of the chromosomal fragments hosting NMT1 and NMT2 in humans and found that NMT1 and NMT2 trace back to a single vertebrate ancestral chromosome. We also report the presence of putative nuclear localization sequence (NLS) and amino acid residues flanking NLS. The presence of phosphorylatable amino acid residues flanking the NLS suggests that nuclear localization of NMT is regulated by phosphorylation. The nuclear localization of NMT suggest its potential role in gene transcription.",

However, the parasitoids ability to evolve towards increased success on a given host simultaneously with the evolution of the composition of its venom has never been demonstrated. Here, we designed an experimental evolution to address this question. We crossed two parasitoid lines of Leptopilina boulardi differing both in parasitic success on different Drosophila hosts and venom composition. F2 descendants were reared on three different Drosophila species for nine generations. We tested for evolution of parasitic success over the generations and for the capacity of parasitoids selected on a given host to succeed on another host. We also tested whether the venom composition - based on a statistical analysis of the variation in intensity of the venom protein bands on SDS-PAGE 1D - evolved in response to different host species. Results showed a specialization of the parasitoids on their selection host and a rapid and differential evolution of the venom composition according to the host. Overall, data suggest a high potential for parasitoids to adapt to a new host, which may have important consequences in the field as well in the context of biological control.",

    "abstract": "Four species of spotted skunks (Carnivora, Mephitidae, Spilogale) are currently recognized: Spilogale angustifrons, S. gracilis, S. putorius, and S. pygmaea. Understanding species boundaries within this group is critical for effective conservation given that regional populations or subspecies (e.g., S. p. interrupta) have experienced significant population declines. Further, there may be currently unrecognized diversity within this genus as some taxa (e.g., S. angustifrons) and geographic regions (e.g., Central America) never have been assessed using DNA sequence data. We analyzed species limits and diversification patterns in spotted skunks using multilocus nuclear (ultraconserved elements) and mitochondrial (whole mitogenomes and single gene analysis) data sets from broad geographic sampling representing all currently recognized species and subspecies. We found a high degree of genetic divergence among Spilogale that reflects seven distinct species and eight unique mitochondrial lineages. Initial divergence between S. pygmaea and all other Spilogale occurred 29 in the Early Pliocene (~ 5.0 million years ago) which was followed by subsequent diversification of the remaining Spilogale into an \"eastern\" and \"western\" lineage during the Early Pleistocene (~1.5 million years ago). These two lineages experienced temporally coincident patterns of diversification at ~0.66 and ~0.35 million years ago into two and ultimately three distinct evolutionary units, respectively. Diversification was confined almost entirely within the Pleistocene during a timeframe characterized by alternating glacial-interglacial cycles, with the origin of this diversity occurring in northeastern Mexico and the southwestern United States of America. Mitochondrial-nuclear discordance was recovered across three lineages in geographic regions consistent with secondary contact, including a distinct mitochondrial lineage confined to the Sonoran Desert. Our results have direct consequences for conservation of threatened populations, or species, as well as for our understanding of the evolution of delayed implantation in this enigmatic group of small carnivores.",

While alignment-based methods are fundamentally limited in their applicability to polyploids, alignment-free methods bypass most of these limits. We investigated the use of Mash, a k-mer analysis tool that uses the MinHash method to reduce complexity in large genomic datasets, for basic population genetic analyses of polyploid sequences. We measured the degree to which Mash correctly estimated pairwise genetic distance in simulated diploid and polyploid short-read sequences with various levels of missing data. Mash-based estimates of genetic distance were comparable to alignment-based estimates, and were less impacted by missing data. We also used Mash to analyze publicly available short-read data for three polyploid and one diploid species, then compared Mash results to published results. For both simulated and real data, Mash accurately estimated pairwise genetic differences for polyploids as well as diploids as much as 476 times faster than alignment-based methods, though we found that Mash genetic distance estimates could be biased by per-sample read depth. Mash may be a particularly useful addition to the toolkit of polyploid geneticists for rapid confirmation of alignment-based results and for basic population genetics in reference-free systems with poor quality DNA.",

Three measures to common scab reaction were assessed, namely percentage of scabby tubers, and disease area and lesion indices, which were highly correlated (>0.76). Due to large environmental effect, heritability values were zero for all three traits in MN11, but moderate to high in PA11 and ME12 (0.44~0.79). We identified a single quantitative trait locus (QTL) for lesion index in PA11, ME12 and joint analyses on linkage group 3, explaining 22~30% of the total variation.

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 140 prostate cancer (PrCa) risk regions which provide potential insights into causal mechanisms. Multiple lines of evidence show that a significant proportion of PrCa risk can be explained by germline causal variants that dysregulate nearby target genes in prostate-relevant tissues thus altering disease risk. The traditional approach to explore this hypothesis has been correlating GWAS variants with steady-state transcript levels, referred to as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). In this work, we assess the utility of chromosome conformation capture (3C) coupled with immunoprecipitation (HiChIP) to identify target genes for PrCa GWAS risk loci. We find that interactome data confirms previously reported PrCa target genes identified through GWAS/eQTL overlap (e.g., MLPH). Interestingly, HiChIP identified links between PrCa GWAS variants and genes well-known to play a role in prostate cancer biology (e.g., AR) that are not detected by eQTL-based methods. We validate these findings through CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) perturbation of the variant-containing regulatory elements for NKX3-1 and AR in the LNCaP cell line. Our results demonstrate that looping data harbor additional information beyond eQTLs and expand the number of PrCa GWAS loci that can be linked to candidate susceptibility genes.",

    "abstract": "Species harbor extensive structural variation underpinning recent adaptive evolution and major disease phenotypes. Most sequence rearrangements are generated non-randomly along the genome through non-allelic recombination and transposable element activity. However, the causality between genomic features and the induction of new rearrangements is poorly established. Here, we analyze a global set of telomere-to-telomere genome assemblies of a major fungal pathogen of wheat to establish a nucleotide-level map of structural variation. We show that the recent emergence of pesticide resistance has been disproportionally driven by rearrangements. We used machine-learning to train a model on structural variation events based on 30 chromosomal sequence features. We show that base composition and gene density are the major determinants of structural variation. Low-copy LINE and Gypsy retrotransposons explain most inversion, indel and duplication events. We retrain our model on Arabidopsis thaliana and show that our modelling approach can be extended to more complex genomes. Finally, we analyzed complete genomes of haploid offspring in a four-generation pedigree. Meiotic crossover locations were enriched for newly generated structural variation consistent with crossovers being mutational hotspots. The model trained on species-wide structural variation predicted the position of >74% of the newly generated variants along the pedigree. The predictive power highlights causality between specific sequence features and the induction of chromosomal rearrangements. Our work demonstrates that training sequence-derived models can accurately identify regions of intrinsic DNA instability in eukaryotic genomes.",

While we know something about genetic variation and structure of many species of conservation importance, we know very little about the non-genetic contributions to variation. Rhizophora mangle is a foundation species that occurs in coastal estuarine habitats throughout the neotropics where it provides critical ecosystem functions, and is potentially threatened by climate change. Several studies have documented landscape level patterns of genetic variation in this species, but we know virtually nothing about the inheritance of non-genetic variation. To assess one type of non-genetic variation, we examined the patterns of DNA sequence and DNA methylation in maternal plants and offspring from natural populations of R. mangle from the Gulf Coast of Florida. We used a reduced representation bisulfite sequencing approach (epi-genotyping by sequencing or epiGBS) to address the following questions: a) What are the levels of genetic and epigenetic diversity in natural populations of R. mangle? b) How are genetic and epigenetic variation structured within and among populations? c) How faithfully is epigenetic variation inherited? We found low genetic diversity but high epigenetic diversity from natural populations of maternal plants in the field and that a large portion (up to ~25%) of epigenetic differences among offspring grown in common garden was explained by maternal family. Therefore, epigenetic variation could be an important source of response to challenging environments in the genetically depauperate populations of this foundation species.",

    "abstract": "MotivationMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that have a key role in the regulation of gene expression. The importance of miRNAs is widely acknowledged by the community nowadays, and the precise prediction of novel candidates with computational methods is still very needed. This could be done by searching homologous with sequence alignment tools, but this will be restricted only to sequences very similar to the known miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs). Further-more, other important properties of pre-miRNAs, such as the secondary structure, are not taken into account by these methods. Many machine learning approaches were proposed in the last years to fill this gap, but these methods were tested in very controlled conditions, which are not fulfilled, for example, when predicting in newly sequenced genomes, where no miRNAs are known. If these methods are used under real conditions, the precision achieved is far from the one published.\n\nResultsThis work provides a novel approach for dealing with the computational prediction of pre-miRNAs: a convolutional deep residual neural network. The proposed model has been tested on several complete genomes of animals and plants, achieving a precision up to 5 times higher than other approaches at the same recall rates. Also, a novel validation methodology is used to ensure that the performance reported can be achieved when using the method on new unknown species.\n\nAvailabilityTo provide fast an easy access to mirDNN, a web demo is available here. It can process fasta files with multiple sequences to calculate the prediction scores, and can generate the nucleotide importance plots.

    "abstract": "The computation of tautomer ratios of druglike molecules is enormously important in computer-aided drug discovery, as over a quarter of all approved drugs can populate multiple tautomeric species in solution. Unfortunately, accurate calculations of aqueous tautomer ratios--the degree to which these species must be penalized in order to correctly account for tautomers in modeling binding for computer-aided drug discovery--is surprisingly diffcult. While quantum chemical approaches to computing aqueous tautomer ratios using continuum solvent models and rigid-rotor harmonic-oscillator thermochemistry are currently state of the art, these methods are still surprisingly inaccurate despite their enormous computational expense. Here, we show that a major source of this inaccuracy lies in the breakdown of the standard approach to accounting for quantum chemical thermochemistry using rigid rotor harmonic oscillator (RRHO) approximations, which are frustrated by the complex conformational landscape introduced by the migration of double bonds, creation of stereocenters, and introduction of multiple conformations separated by low energetic barriers induced by migration of a single proton. Using quantum machine learning (QML) methods that allow us to compute potential energies with quantum chemical accuracy at a fraction of the cost, we show how rigorous relative alchemical free energy calculations can be used to compute tautomer ratios in vacuum free from the limitations introduced by RRHO approximations. Furthermore, since the parameters of QML methods are tunable, we show how we can train these models to correct limitations in the underlying learned quantum chemical potential energy surface using free energies, enabling these methods to learn to generalize tautomer free energies across a broader range of predictions.",

    "abstract": "Studying the effect of perturbations on protein structure is a basic approach in protein research. Important problems, such as predicting pathological mutations and understanding patterns structural evolution, have been addressed by computational simulations based on modelling mutations as forces and predicting deformations using the Linear Response Approximation. In single mutation-response scanning simulations, a sensitivity matrix is obtained by averaging deformations over point mutations. In double mutation-response scanning simulations, a compensation matrix is obtained by minimizing deformations over pairs of mutations. These very useful simulation-based methods may be too slow to deal with large supra-molecular complexes, such as a ribosome or a virus capsid, or large number of proteins, such as the human proteome, which limits their applicability. To address this issue, I derived analytical closed formulas to calculate the sensitivity and compensation matrices directly, without simulations. Here, I present these derivations and show that the resulting analytical methods are much faster than their simulation counterparts, and that where the simulation methods are approximate, the analytical methods are exact by design.",

    "abstract": "With over 15,000 extant species, Decapoda--or ten-legged crustaceans such as crabs, shrimp, lobsters, and relatives-- are among the most speciose and economically important group of crustaceans. Despite of their diversity, anatomical disparity, and remarkable fossil record extending back to the Late Paleozoic, the origins of Decapoda and their phylogenetic relationships with eumalacostracans remains elusive and inconclusive. Molecular dating suggests that decapods originated in the Late Ordovician (~450 Mya), but no reliable fossil crown groups are found until the Late Devonian. Moreover, there is no consensus on which lineages belong to stem groups, obscuring our understanding of the roots of the ten-legged decapod body plans as a whole, and how they relate to other non-decapod crustaceans. We present new, exceptional fossils from the Late Devonian of Czech Republic and Poland that belong to {dagger}Angustidontida, an odd shrimp-looking crustacean with a combination of anatomical features unlike those of any crown eumalacostracan known--extinct or extant. Our phylogenetic analyses, including representatives of all major lineages of crown eumalacostracans plus {dagger}Angustidontida, identify angustidontids as the only known stem-group decapod, and give hints about the transformation series, polarity of change, and evolutionary pathways leading to the modern decapod body plans seen today.",

    "abstract": "Processing time-dependent information requires cells to quantify the duration of past regulatory events and program the time span of future signals. At the single-cell level, timer mechanisms can be implemented with genetic circuits: sets of genes connected to achieve specific tasks. However, such systems are difficult to implement in single cells due to saturation in molecular components and stochasticity in the limited intracellular space. Multicellular implementations, on the other hand, outsource some of the components of information-processing circuits to the extracellular space, and thereby might escape those constraints. Here we develop a theoretical framework, based on a trilinear coordinate representation, to study the collective behavior of a cellular population composed of three cell types under stationary conditions. This framework reveals that distributing different processes (in our case the production, detection and degradation of a time-encoding signal) across distinct cell types enables the robust implementation of a multicellular timer. Our analysis also shows the circuit to be easily tunable by varying the cellular composition of the consortium.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities that metabolise pentose and hexose sugars are useful in producing high-value chemicals, as this can result in the effective conversion of raw materials to the product, a reduction in the production cost, and increased yield. Here, we present a computational approach called CAMP (Co-culture/Community Analyses for Metabolite Production) that simulates and identifies appropriate communities to produce a metabolite of interest. To demonstrate this approach, we focus on optimal production of lactate from various Lactic Acid Bacteria. We used genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs) belonging to Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, and Pediococcus species from the Virtual Metabolic Human (VMH; https://vmh.life/) resource and well-curated GSMMs of L. plantarum WCSF1 and L. reuteri JCM 1112. We studied 1176 two-species communities using a constraint-based modelling method for steady-state flux-balance analysis of communities. Flux variability analysis was used to detect the maximum lactate flux in a community. Using glucose or xylose as substrates separately or in combination resulted in either parasitism, amensalism, or mutualism being the dominant interaction behaviour in the communities. Interaction behaviour between members of the community was deduced based on variations in the predicted growth rates of monocultures and co-cultures. Acetaldehyde, ethanol, NH4+, among other metabolites, were found to be cross-fed between community members. L. plantarum WCSF1 was a member of communities with high lactate yields. In silico community optimisation strategies to predict reaction knock-outs for improving lactate flux were implemented. Reaction knock-outs of acetate kinase, phosphate acetyltransferase, and fumarate reductase in the communities were found to enhance lactate production.\n\nImportanceUnderstanding compatibility and interactions based on growth between the members of a microbial community is imperative to exploit these communities for biotechnological applications. Towards this goal, here, we introduce a computational analysis framework that evaluates all possible two-species communities generated from a given set of microbial species on single or multiple substrates to achieve optimal production of a target metabolite. As a case study, we analysed communities of Lactic Acid Bacteria to produce lactate. Lactate is a platform chemical produced experimentally from lignocellulosic biomass, which constitutes pentoses and hexoses, such as xylose and glucose. Metabolic engineering strategies, such as reaction knock-outs that can improve product flux while retaining the communitys viability are identified using in silico optimisation methods. Our approach can guide in the selection of most promising communities for experimental testing and validation to produce valuable bio-based chemicals.",

This study also aimed to reveal potential predictors for insulin sensitivity or give perceptive insight into disease processes.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a lipidomics evaluation of molecularly distinct SPs in the serum of 86 consecutive Chinese adults with or without obesity and diabetes using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry coupled with liquid chromatography. The GIR30 was measured under steady conditions to assess insulin sensitivity by the gold standard hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. We created the ROC curves to detect the serum SMs diagnostic value and establish the diagnosis of insulin sensitivity.\n\nResultsDifferential correlation network analysis illustrated correlations amongst lipids, insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion and other clinical indexes. Total and subspecies of serum SMs and globotriaosylceramides (Gb3s) were positively related to GIR30, free FAs (FFA 16:1, FFA20:4), some long chain GM3 and complex ceramide GluCers showed strong negative correlations with GIR30. Notably, ROC curves showed that SM/Cer and SM d18:0/26:0 may be good serum lipid predictors of diagnostic indicators of insulin sensitivity close to conventional clinical indexes such as 1/HOMA-IR (all areas under the curve >0.80) based on GIR30 as standard diagnostic criteria.\n\nConclusionsThese results provide novel associations between serum sphingolipid between insulin sensitivity measured by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. We further identify two specific SPs that may represent prognostic biomarkers for insulin sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "There is growing evidence that humans use olfactory chemosensory signals for social communication, but their role in affective associative learning is largely unknown. To examine this, women implicitly learned face-odor associations by pairing different neutral male faces with either a male chemosignal presumably involved in human mating behavior (dissolved {Delta}4,16-androstadien-3-one, \"AND\"), a pleasant smell (dissolved vanillin) or the neutral solvent alone. After learning, women rated faces previously paired with AND or vanillin as more attractive than faces paired with solvent, even though they were unable to identify the contingency of face-odor pairings above chance level. On a neurophysiological level, both AND- and vanillin-associated faces evoked stronger magnetoencephalographic correlates of enhanced emotional attention than solvent-associated faces at early (<120 ms) and mid-latency (140-270 ms) processing stages. This study stresses the role of AND as a human chemosignal in implicit social communication and demonstrates its effectiveness in modulating emotional learning.",

    "abstract": "Research on neurodegenerative disorders has been hampered by the limited access to patients brain tissue and the absence of relevant physiological models with human neurons, accounting for the little success of clinical trials. Moreover, post-mortem samples cannot provide a detailed picture of the complex pathological mechanisms taking place throughout the course of the disease. This holds particularly true for Huntingtons disease (HD), an incurable inherited brain disorder marked by a massive striatal degeneration due to abnormal accumulation of misfolded huntingtin protein. To characterize progressive human neurodegeneration in vivo, we transplanted induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) from control (CTR-hNPCs) and HD patients (HD-hNPCs) into the striatum of neonatal wild-type mice. Implanted human cells were examined by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy, and chimeric mice were subjected to behavioral testing. Most grafted hNPCs differentiated into striatal neurons that sent axonal projections to their natural targets and established synaptic connections within the host basal ganglia circuitry. HD-hNPCs first showed developmental abnormalities characterized by an increased proliferation and accelerated medium spiny neuron (MSN) differentiation, mimicking the initial striatal hypertrophy of child mutant huntingtin (mHTT) carriers. HD human striatal neurons progressively developed mHTT oligomers and aggregates, which primarily targeted mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear membrane to cause structural alterations. Five months after transplantation, selective death of human MSNs and striatal degeneration altered mouse behavior, suggesting disease propagation to non-mutated host cells. Histological analysis and co-culture experiments revealed that HD-hNPCs secreted extracellular vesicles containing soluble mHTT oligomers, which were internalized by mouse striatal neurons triggering cell death. Finally, in vivo pharmacological inhibition of the exosomal secretory pathway through sphingosine-1 phosphate receptor functional antagonism, limited the spreading of apoptosis within the host striatum. Our findings cast new light on human neurodegeneration, unveiling cell and non-cell autonomous mechanisms that drive HD progression in patients.",

In this work, we explored a formulation of LDSC that replaces the r2 measure of LD with a recently-proposed unbiased estimator of the D2 statistic. In addition to modest statistical difference across estimators, this derivation highlighted implicit and unrealistic assumptions about the relationship between allele frequency, effect size, and annotation status. We carry out a systematic comparison of alternative LDSC formulations by applying them to summary statistics from 47 GWAS traits. Our results show that commonly used models likely underestimate functional enrichment. These results highlight the importance of calibrating the LDSC model to achieve a more robust understanding of polygenic traits.",

    "abstract": "Modern DNA sequencing is used as a readout for diverse assays, with the count of aligned sequences, or \"read depth\", serving as the quantitative signal for many underlying cellular phenomena. Despite wide use and thousands of datasets, existing formats used for the storage and analysis of read depths are limited with respect to both file size and analysis speed. For example, it is faster to recalculate sequencing depth from an alignment file than it is to analyze the text output from that calculation. We sought to improve on existing formats such as BigWig and compressed BED files by creating the Dense Depth Data Dump (D4) format and tool suite. The D4 format is adaptive in that it profiles a random sample of aligned sequence depth from the input BAM or CRAM file to determine an optimal encoding that often affords reductions in file size, while also enabling fast data access. We show that D4 uses less storage for both RNA-Seq and whole-genome sequencing and offers 3 to 440-fold speed improvements over existing formats for random access, aggregation and summarization. This performance enables scalable downstream analyses that would be otherwise difficult. The D4 tool suite (d4tools) is freely available under an MIT license at: https://github.com/38/d4-format.",

    "abstract": "Predation is one of the strongest selection pressures, forcing prey organisms to detect predators and to display various antipredator behaviours, such as refuge-use or decreased activity. To recognise predators, chemosensory cues play a pivotal role, particularly in aquatic ecosystems. However, it is less known whether the ability to use these cues to respond with adequate antipredator behaviour varies between individuals occupying different habitats that are dissimilar in predation risk. Using field experiments, we examined antipredator behaviour of larval fire salamanders (Salamandra salamandra) from two different habitats, ponds and streams. Among other differences, ponds and streams are inhabited by habitat-specific predators, such as alpine newts (Ichthyosaura alpestris) occurring in ponds. We exposed larvae from both habitats to either chemical cues from alpine newts or a blank control (tap water) and investigated potential differences in their behavioural responses in two experiments. Pond larvae, but not stream larvae, became significantly less active when faced with chemical cues from newts compared to those faced with a control stimulus. Moreover, larvae from both habitats tested in water containing chemical cues spent significantly less time outside a shelter than those in control water. Our results demonstrate that larval fire salamanders recognise predatory newts through kairomones and alter their behaviour accordingly. However, experience with predatory newts may not be necessary to differentiate kairomones from control water, but may be beneficial for larvae to further develop their antipredator behaviour, thus representing conformance to a niche.",

    "abstract": "Considerable evidence shows that the vestibular system contributes to adjusting sympathetic nervous system activity to maintain adequate blood pressure during movement and changes in posture. However, only a few prior experiments entailed recordings in conscious animals from brainstem neurons presumed to convey baroreceptor and vestibular inputs to neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) that provide inputs to sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord. In this study, recordings were made in conscious felines from neurons in the medullary lateral tegmental field (LTF) and nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) identified as regulating sympathetic nervous system activity by exhibiting changes in firing rate related to the cardiac cycle, or cardiac-related activity (CRA). Approximately 38% of LTF and NTS neurons responded to static 40{degrees} head up tilts with a change in firing rate of ~50%. However, few of these neurons responded to 10{degrees} sinusoidal rotations in the pitch plane, in contrast to prior findings in decerebrate animals that the firing rates of both NTS and LTF neurons are modulated by small-amplitude body rotations. Thus, as previously demonstrated for RVLM neurons, in conscious animals NTS and LTF neurons only respond to large rotations that lead to changes in sympathetic nervous system activity. The similar responses to head-up rotations of LTF and NTS neurons with those documented for RVLM neurons suggest that LTF and NTS neurons are components of the vestibulo-sympathetic reflex pathway. However, a difference between NTS/LTF neurons and RVLM was variability in CRA over time. This variability was significantly greater for RVLM neurons, raising the hypothesis that the responsiveness of these neurons to baroreceptor input is adjusted based on the animals vigilance and alertness.",

Ripples have been defined based on mathematically engineered features, such as magnitudes, durations, and cycles per event. However, the \"ripples\" could vary from laboratory to laboratory because their definition is subject to human bias, including the arbitrary choice of parameters and thresholds. In addition, local field potentials are often influenced by myoelectric noise arising from animal movement, making it difficult to distinguish ripples from high-frequency noises. To overcome these problems, we extracted ripple candidates under few constraints and labeled them as binary or stochastic \"true\" or \"false\" ripples using Gaussian mixed model clustering and a deep convolutional neural network in a weakly supervised fashion. Our automatic method separated ripples and myoelectric noise and was able to detect ripples even when the animals were moving. Moreover, we confirmed that a convolutional neural network was able to detect ripples defined by our method. Leave-one-animal-out cross-validation estimated the area under the precision-recall curve for ripple detection to be 0.72. Finally, our model establishes an appropriate threshold for the ripple magnitude in the case of the conventional detection of ripples.",

    "abstract": "Despite recognized layered structure and increasing evidence for criticality in the cortex, how the specification of input, output and computational layers affects the self-organized criticality has been surprisingly neglected. By constructing heterogeneous structures with a well-accepted model of leaky neurons, we found that the specification can lead to robust criticality almost insensitive to the strength of external stimuli. This naturally unifies the adaptation to strong inputs without extra synaptic plasticity mechanisms. Presence of output neurons constitutes an alternative explanation to subcriticality other than the high frequency inputs. Degree of recurrence is proposed as a network metric to account for the signal termination due to output neurons. Unlike fully recurrent networks where external stimuli always render subcriticality, the dynamics of networks with sufficient feed-forward connections can be driven to criticality and supercriticality. These findings indicate that functional and structural specification and their interplay with external stimuli are of crucial importance for the network dynamics. The robust criticality puts forward networks of the leaky neurons as a promising platform for realizing artificial neural networks that work in the vicinity of critical points.",

    "abstract": "Rigid and affine registrations to a common template are the essential steps during pre-processing of brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Manual quality check (QC) of these registrations is quite tedious if the data contains several thousands of images. Therefore, we propose a machine learning (ML) framework for fully automatic QC of these registrations via local computation of the similarity functions such as normalized cross-correlation, normalized mutual-information, and correlation ratio, and using these as features for training of different ML classifiers. To facilitate supervised learning, misaligned images are generated. A structural MRI dataset consisting of 215 subjects from autism brain imaging data exchange is used for 5-fold cross-validation and testing. Few classifiers such as kNN, AdaBoost, and random forest reached testing F1-scores of 0.98 for QC of both rigid and affine registrations. These tested ML models could be deployed for practical use.",

    "abstract": "Meter-resolution imagery of our world and myriad biodiversity records collected through citizen scientists and automated sensors belie the fact that much of the planets biodiversity remains undiscovered. Conservative estimates suggest only 13 to 18% of all living species may be known at this point 1-4, although this number could be as low as 1.5% 5. This biodiversity shortfall 6,7 strongly impedes the sustainable management of our planets resources, as the potential ecological and economic relevance of undiscovered species remains unrecognized 8. Here we use model-based predictions of terrestrial vertebrate species discovery to estimate future taxonomic and geographic discovery opportunities. Our model identifies distinct taxonomic and geographic unevenness in future discovery potential, with greatest opportunities for amphibians and reptiles and for Neotropical and IndoMalayan forests. Brazil, Indonesia, Madagascar, and Colombia emerge as holding greatest discovery opportunities, with a quarter of future species descriptions expected there. These findings highlight the significance of international support for taxonomic initiatives and the potential of quantitative models to aid the discovery of species before their functions are lost in ignorance 8. As nations draw up new policy goals under the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, a better understanding of the magnitude and geography of this known unknown is critical to inform goals and priorities 9 and to minimize future discoveries lost to extinction10.",

The important sources of measurement- and sampling uncertainties have been included using a hierarchical model structure. Furthermore, the measurement- and sampling uncertainties are separated from the process uncertainty, which is important when generating ecological predictions. Generally, increasing atmospheric nitrogen deposition leads to more grass-dominated acid grassland habitats at the expense of the cover of forbs. Sandy soils are relatively more acidic, and the effect of soil type on the vegetation includes both direct effects of soil type and indirect effects mediated by the effect of soil type on soil pH. Both soil type and soil pH affected the vegetation of acid grasslands. Even though only a small part of the temporal variation in cover was explained by the model, it will still be useful to quantify the uncertainties when using the model for generating local ecological predictions and adaptive management plans.",

    "abstract": "India led the global tiger conservation initiatives since last decade and has doubled its wild tiger population to 2967 (2603-3346). The survival of these growing populations residing inside the continuously shrinking habitats is a major concern, which can only be tackled through focused landscape-scale conservation planning across five major extant Indian tiger landscapes. The Terai-Arc landscape (TAL) is one of the  global priority tiger conservation landscapes holding 22% of the countrys wild tigers. We used intensive field-sampling, genetic analyses and GIS modelling to investigate tiger population structure, source-sink dynamics and functionality of the existing corridors across TAL. Genetic analyses with 219 tigers revealed three low, but sigficantly differentiated tiger subpopulations. Overall, we identified Seven source and 10 sink areas in TAL through genetic migrant and gene flow analyses. GIS modelling identified total 19 (10 high, three medium and six low conductance) corridors in this landscape, with 10 being critical to maintain landscape connectivity. We suggest urgent management attention towards 2707 sq. km. non-protected habitat, mitigation measures associated with ongoing linear infrastructure developments and transboundary coordination with Nepal to ensure habitat and genetic connectivity and long-term sustainability of tigers in this globally important landscape.",

    "abstract": "Cultural processes of change bear many resemblances to biological evolution. Identifying underlying units of evolution, however, has remained elusive in non-biological domains, especially in music, where music evolution is often considered to be a loose metaphor. Here we introduce a general framework to jointly identify underlying units and their associated evolutionary processes using a latent modeling approach. Musical styles and principles of organization in dimensions such as harmony, melody and rhythm can be modeled as partly following an evolutionary process. Furthermore, we propose that such processes can be identified by extracting latent evolutionary signatures from musical corpora, analogous to the analysis of mutational signatures in evolutionary genomics, particularly in cancer. These latent signatures provide a generative code for each song, which allows us to identify broad trends and associations between songs and genres. To provide a test case, we analyze songs from the McGill Billboard dataset, in order to find popular chord transitions (k-mers), associate them with music genres and identify latent evolutionary signatures related to these transitions. First, we use a generalized singular value decomposition to identify associations between songs, motifs and genres, and then we use a deep generative model based on a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework to extract a latent code for each song. We tie these latent representations together across the dataset by incorporating an energy-based prior, which encourages songs close in evolutionary space to share similar codes. Using this framework, we are able to identify broad trends and genre-specific features of the dataset. Further, our evolutionary model outperforms non-evolutionary models in tasks such as period and genre prediction. To our knowledge, ours is the first computational approach to identify and quantify patterns of music evolution de novo.",

    "abstract": "Reproductive division of labor has been proposed to play a key role for evolutionary transitions in individuality (ETIs). This chapter provides a guide to a theoretical model that addresses the role of a tradeoff between life-history traits in selecting for a reproductive division of labor during the transition from unicellular to multicellular organisms. In particular, it focuses on the five key assumptions of the model, namely (1) fitness is viability times fecundity; (2) collective traits are linear functions of their cellular counterparts; (3) there is a tradeoff between cell viability and fecundity; (4) cell contribution to the collective is optimal; and (5) there is an initial reproductive cost in large collectives. Thereafter the chapter contrasts two interpretations of the model in the context of ETIs. Originally, the model was interpreted as showing that during the transition to multicellularity the fitness of the lower-level (the cells) is \"transferred\" to the higher level (the collective). Despite its apparent intuitiveness, fitness transfer may obscure actual mechanisms in metaphorical language. Thus, an alternative and more conservative interpretation of the model that focuses on cell traits and the evolutionary constraints that link them is advocated. In addition, it allows for pursuing subsequent questions, such as the evolution of development.",

    "abstract": "The mapping from protein sequence to function is highly complex, making it challenging to predict how sequence changes will affect a proteins behavior and properties. We present a supervised deep learning framework to learn the sequence-function mapping from deep mutational scanning data and make predictions for new, uncharacterized sequence variants. We test multiple neural network architectures, including a graph convolutional network that incorporates protein structure, to explore how a networks internal representation affects its ability to learn the sequence-function mapping. Our supervised learning approach displays superior performance over physics-based and unsupervised prediction methods. We find networks that capture nonlinear interactions and share parameters across sequence positions are important for learning the relationship between sequence and function. Further analysis of the trained models reveals the networks ability to learn biologically meaningful information about protein structure and mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate the models ability to navigate sequence space and design new proteins beyond the training set. We applied the GB1 models to design a sequence that binds to IgG with substantially higher affinity than wild-type GB1. Our software is available from https://github.com/gitter-lab/nn4dms.\n\nSignificanceUnderstanding the relationship between protein sequence and function is necessary to design new and useful proteins with applications in bioenergy, medicine, and agriculture. The mapping from sequence to function is tremendously complex because it involves thousands of molecular interactions that are coupled over multiple lengths and timescales. In this work, we show neural networks can learn the sequence-function mapping from large protein datasets. Neural networks are appealing for this task because they can learn complicated relationships from data, make few assumptions about the nature of the sequencefunction relationship, and can learn general rules that apply across the length of the protein sequence. We demonstrate the learned models can be applied to design new proteins with properties that exceed natural sequences.",

The composition of a microbial population is often quantified through measures of species diversity, which summarize the number of species along with their relative abundances into a single value. In a microbiome sample there will certainly be species missing from the target population which will affect the diversity estimates.\n\nMethodsWe employ a model based on the hierarchical Pitman-Yor (HPY) process to model the species abundance distributions over multiple populations. The model parameters are estimated using a Gibbs sampler. We also derive estimates of species diversity, conditional and unconditional on the observed data, as a function of the HPY parameters Finally, we derive a general formula for the Hill numbers in the HPY context.\n\nResultsWe show that the Gibbs sampler for the HPY model performs well in simulations. We also show that the conditional estimates of diversity from the HPY model improve over naive estimates when species are missing. Similarly the conditional HPY estimates tend to perform better than the naive estimates especially when the number of individuals sampled from a population is small.",

We present Alleloscope, a method for allele-specific copy number estimation that can be applied to single cell DNA and ATAC sequencing data, either separately or in combination. This approach allows for integrative multi-omic analysis of allele-specific copy number and chromatin accessibility on the same cell. On scDNA-seq data from gastric, colorectal, and breast cancer samples, with extensive validation using matched linked-read sequencing, Alleloscope finds pervasive occurrence of highly complex, multi-allelic copy number aberrations, where cells that carry varying allelic configurations adding to the same total copy number co-evolve within a tumor. The contributions of such allele-specific events to intratumor heterogeneity have been under-reported and under-studied due to the lack of methods for their detection. On scATAC-seq from two basal cell carcinoma samples and a gastric cancer cell line, Alleloscope detects multi-allelic copy number events and copy neutral loss-of-heterozygosity, enabling the dissection of the contributions of chromosomal instability and chromatin remodeling in tumor evolution.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasound or shockwave-induced cavitation is used therapeutically to stimulate neural and muscle tissue, but the mechanisms underlying this mechanotransduction are unclear. Intracellular Ca2+ signaling is one of the earliest events in mechanotransduction. In this study, we investigate the mechanism of Ca2+ signaling in individual HEK293T cells stimulated by single cavitation bubbles. Ca2+ responses are rare at cell-bubble distance that avoids membrane poration, even with overexpression of the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1, but could be increased in frequency to 42% of cells by attaching RGD beads to the apical surface of the cells. By using Piezo1 knockout and Piezo1-expressing cells, integrin-blocking antibodies, and inhibitors of P2X ion channels, key molecular players are identified in the RGD bead-enhanced Ca2+ response: increased integrin ligation by substrate ECM triggers ATP release and activation of P2X--but not Piezo1--ion channels. These molecular players have not been examined previously in cavitation-induced Ca2+ signaling. The resultant Ca2+ influx causes dynamic changes in cell spread area. This approach to eliciting a Ca2+ response with cavitation microbubbles without cell injury, and the uncovered mechanotransduction mechanism by which increased integrin-ligation mediates ATP release and Ca2+ signaling will inform new strategies to stimulate tissues with ultrasound and shockwaves.",

    "abstract": "Biophysics experiments performed at single-molecule resolution contain exceptional insight into the structural details and dynamic behavior of biological systems. However, extracting this information from the corresponding experimental data unequivocally requires applying a biophysical model. Here, we discuss how to use probability theory to apply these models to single-molecule data. Many current single-molecule data analysis methods apply parts of probability theory, sometimes unknowingly, and thus miss out on the full set of benefits provided by this self-consistent framework. The full application of probability theory involves a process called Bayesian inference that fully accounts for the uncertainties inherent to single-molecule experiments. Additionally, using Bayesian inference provides a scientifically rigorous manner to incorporate information from multiple experiments into a single analysis and to find the best biophysical model for an experiment without the risk of overfitting the data. These benefits make the Bayesian approach ideal for analyzing any type of single-molecule experiment.",

    "abstract": "Haustoriid amphipods, despite their ubiquity in coastal sand or mud, have received little recent attention and their systematics and phylogenetics are largely unresolved. Some efforts have been made at classifying the family within the broader Amphipoda, but there is persistent incongruence in its placement among different authors and techniques. Furthermore, there exists no phylogenetic hypothesis of intrafamilial relationships despite the potential for rich biogeographic information to be gained given the specific habitat requirements of haustoriids and their limited dispersal abilities. In this work, we evaluate the competing hypotheses on the phylogenetic position of the Haustoriidae within Amphipoda by examining new and previously published sequences of nearly 100 species across 38 families. We find strong support for the Haustoriidae as basal gammarids, and that other families placed within the parvorder \"Haustoriidira\" are spread across Amphipoda. The radiation began during the Eocene and may have been driven in North America by the rapid filling of a coastal niche opened by the Chesapeake Bay impact crater. Unlike previous work, we find that the Pacific-endemic genus Eohaustorius is the most basal haustoriid, and that it separated from the rest of the family ~31 Mya. Finally, based on ancestral reconstructions, we provide taxonomic recommendations for relationships within Haustoriidae, including the elevation of a new genus, Cryptohaustorius. We conclude by recommending that the \"Haustoriidira\" be abandoned.",

    "abstract": "The search for biologically faithful synaptic plasticity rules has resulted in a large body of models. They are usually inspired by - and fitted to - experimental data, but they rarely produce neural dynamics that serve complex functions. These failures suggest that current plasticity models are still under-constrained by existing data. Here, we present an alternative approach that uses meta-learning to discover plausible synaptic plasticity rules. Instead of experimental data, the rules are constrained by the functions they implement and the structure they are meant to produce. Briefly, we parameterize synaptic plasticity rules by a Volterra expansion and then use supervised learning methods (gradient descent or evolutionary strategies) to minimize a problem-dependent loss function that quantifies how effectively a candidate plasticity rule transforms an initially random network into one with the desired function. We first validate our approach by re-discovering previously described plasticity rules, starting at the single-neuron level and \"Ojas rule\", a simple Hebbian plasticity rule that captures the direction of most variability of inputs to a neuron (i.e., the first principal component). We expand the problem to the network level and ask the framework to find Ojas rule together with an anti-Hebbian rule such that an initially random two-layer firing-rate network will recover several principal components of the input space after learning. Next, we move to networks of integrate-and-fire neurons with plastic inhibitory afferents. We train for rules that achieve a target firing rate by countering tuned excitation. Our algorithm discovers a specific subset of the manifold of rules that can solve this task. Our work is a proof of principle of an automated and unbiased approach to unveil synaptic plasticity rules that obey biological constraints and can solve complex functions.",

In contrast to the hierarchical organization of primates, the visual system of the mouse has flatter hierarchy. Since mice are capable of visually guided behavior, this raises questions about the role of architecture in neural computation. In this work, we introduce a framework for building a biologically constrained convolutional neural network model of lateral areas of the mouse visual cortex. The structural parameters of the network are derived from experimental measurements, specifically estimates of numbers of neurons in each area and cortical layer, the interareal connec-tome, and the statistics of connections between cortical layers.

    "abstract": "BackgroundPatients with major depressive disorder (MDD) exhibit concurrent deficits in sensory processing and high-order cognitive functions such as self-awareness and rumination. Connectome mapping studies have suggested a principal primary-to-transmodal gradient in functional brain networks, supporting the spectrum from sensation to cognition. However, whether this principal connectome gradient is disrupted in patients with MDD and how this disruption is associated with gene expression profiles remain unclear.\n\nMethodsUsing a large cohort of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 2,234 participants (1,150 patients with MDD and 1,084 healthy controls) recruited at 10 sites, we investigated MDD-related alterations in the principal connectome gradient. We further used Neurosynth and postmortem gene expression data to assess the cognitive functions and transcriptional profiles related to the gradient alterations in MDD, respectively.\n\nResultsRelative to controls, patients with MDD exhibited abnormal global topography of the principal primary-to-transmodal gradient, as indicated by reduced explanation ratio, gradient range, and gradient variation (Cohens d = -0.16[~]-0.21). Focal alterations of gradient scores were mostly in the primary systems involved in sensory processing and in the transmodal systems implicated in high-order cognition. The transcriptional profiles explained 53.9% of the spatial variance in the altered gradient patterns, with the most correlated genes enriched in transsynaptic signaling and calcium ion binding.\n\nConclusionsThese results highlight the dysfunction of the core connectome hierarchy in MDD and its linkage with gene expression profiles, providing insights into the neurobiological and molecular genetic underpinnings of sensory-cognitive deficits in this disorder.",

For monitoring stimulus-driven activations of a brain region, MRS signals and mesoscopic neural activities were measured during two consecutive sessions of 15-min prolonged sensory stimulations. In the first session, putative excitatory neuronal activities were increased, while inhibitory neuronal activities remained at the baseline level. In the second half, while excitatory neuronal activities remained elevated, inhibitory neuronal activities were significantly enhanced. We also assessed regional neurochemical and functional statuses related to spontaneous neural firing by measuring MRS signals and neuronal activities in a mouse model of Dravet syndrome under a resting condition. Mesoscopic assessments showed that activities of inhibitory neurons in the cortex were diminished relative to wild-type mice in contrast to spared activities of excitatory neurons. Consistent with these observations, the Dravet model exhibited lower concentrations of GABA than wild-type controls. Collectively, the current investigations demonstrate that the MRS-measured Glu and GABA can reflect spontaneous and stimulated activities of neurons producing and releasing these neurotransmitters in an awake condition.",

Here, we asked if developmental changes in axon initial segment spines (AISS) could be modified by neonatal maternal separation through stress hormones and microglial activation and examined the potential behavioral consequences. We examined AISS densities at postnatal day (PND) 15 and 50, using Golgi-Cox staining and anatomical analysis. Neuron-microglial interaction was assessed using antibodies against ankyrinG, PSD95 and Iba1, for AIS, AISS and microglia, respectively, in normally reared and neonatal maternally separated (MS) male and female rats. We observed a higher density of AISS in MS groups at both PND15 and PND50 compared to control. Effects were more pronounced in female than in male rats. AIS-associated microglia showed a hyper-ramified morphology and less co-localization with PSD95 in MS compared to normally reared animals at PND 15. An MS-like alteration in microglial morphology and synaptic pruning could be produced ex vivo by vasopressin application in acute hippocampal slices from normally reared animals. MS rats exhibited increased freezing behavior during auditory fear memory testing which, like effects on AISS density, was more pronounced in females than males. Freezing behavior was associated with Fos expression in dorsal and ventral dentate GC. In summary, AIS associated microglial activity is altered by MS. Sex differences in the long-term effects of MS on AISS density are penetrant to a behavioral phenotype of increased stimulus reactivity in adult female subjects.",

    "abstract": "Brain activation mapping using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been extensively studied in brain gray matter (GM), whereas in large disregarded for probing white matter (WM). This unbalanced treatment has been in part due to controversies in relation to the nature of the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast in WM and its detachability. However, an accumulating body of studies has provided solid evidence of the functional significance of the BOLD signal in WM and has revealed that it exhibits anisotropic spatio-temporal correlations and structure-specific fluctuations concomitant with those of the cortical BOLD signal. In this work, we present an anisotropic spatial filtering scheme for smoothing fMRI data in WM that accounts for known spatial constraints on the BOLD signal in WM. In particular, the spatial correlation structure of the BOLD signal in WM is highly anisotropic and closely linked to local axonal structure in terms of shape and orientation, suggesting that isotropic Gaussian filters conventionally used for smoothing fMRI data are inadequate for denoising the BOLD signal in WM. The fundamental element in the proposed method is a graph-based description of WM that encodes the underlying anisotropy observed across WM, derived from diffusion-weighted MRI data. Based on this representation, and leveraging graph signal processing principles, we design subject-specific spatial filters that adapt to a subjects unique WM structure at each position in the WM that they are applied at. We use the proposed filters to spatially smooth fMRI data in WM, as an alternative to the conventional practice of using isotropic Gaussian filters. We test the proposed filtering approach on two sets of simulated phantoms, showcasing its greater sensitivity and specificity for the detection of slender anisotropic activations, compared to that achieved with isotropic Gaussian filters. We also present WM activation mapping results on the Human Connectome Projects 100-unrelated subject dataset, across seven functional tasks, showing that the proposed method enables the detection of streamline-like activations within axonal bundles.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampal mossy fiber synapse is a key synapse of the trisynaptic circuit of the hippocampus. Post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) is the most powerful form of plasticity at this synaptic connection. It is widely believed that mossy fiber PTP is an entirely presynaptic phenomenon, implying that PTP induction is input-specific, and requires neither activity of multiple inputs nor stimulation of postsynaptic neurons for induction. Thus, mossy fiber PTP appears to lack cooperativity and associativity that characterize other forms of plasticity. To directly test these predictions, we made paired recordings between single mossy fiber terminals and postsynaptic CA3 pyramidal neurons in rat brain slices. By stimulating parallel but non-overlapping mossy fiber bouton (MFB) inputs converging onto single CA3 neurons, we confirmed that PTP was inputspecific and non-cooperative. Unexpectedly, mossy fiber PTP showed anti-associative induction properties. Mossy fiber excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) showed only minimal PTP after combined pre- and postsynaptic high-frequency stimulation (HFS) with intact postsynaptic Ca2+ signaling (0.1 mM EGTA), but marked PTP in the absence of postsynaptic spiking and after suppression of postsynaptic Ca2+ signaling (10 mM EGTA). PTP was rescued by blocking Ca2+ entry via voltage-gated R-type and to a smaller extent L-type Ca2+channels. PTP was also recovered by extracellular application of group II metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) antagonists and vacuolar-type (v-type) H+-ATPase inhibitors, suggesting the involvement of retrograde vesicular glutamate signaling. Transsynaptic regulation of PTP induction may increase the computational power of mossy fiber synapses, and implement a break on hippocampal mossy fiber detonation.",

Of note, antibiotic resistance genes are significantly popular in clinical isolates of A. baumannii. Therefore, rapid identification of A. baumannii and determination of antibiotic resistance genes will help to make effective clinical decisions related to antibiotic use. This paper proposes a multiplex PCR to identify Acinetobacter baumannii and detect their {beta}-lactam antibiotic resistance genes in clinical isolates. Multiplex PCR was applied to amplified recA gene and region ITS 16S - 23S rDNA for Rapid detection of A. baumannii. The two antibiotic resistance genes - blaOXA-51-like, ampC gene - were detected by multiplex PCR and three genes coding Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases - blaCTX-M, blaTEM, blaSHV genes - were subjected to PCR. 49 bacteria strains were subjected to colony PCR. The result showed that 46 strains were A. baumannii and 3 strains belonged to the genus Acinetobacter. The multiplex PCR showed that all of 46 A. baumannii containing the blaOXA-51-like gene and the AmpC gene; 34 strains possess the gene blaTEM and none of them has blaCTX-M and blaSHV genes. The results of the multiplex PCR are the same as those of the in vitro antibiotic sensitivity testing of A. baumannii.

    "abstract": "The adaptor protein complex AP-4 mediates anterograde axonal transport and is essential for axon health. AP-4-deficient patients suffer from a severe neurological disorder, which encompasses neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative features. While impaired autophagy has been suggested to account for axon degeneration in AP-4 deficiency, axon growth defects occur through an unknown mechanism. Here we use orthogonal proteomic and imaging methods to identify DAGLB (diacylglycerol lipase-beta) as a cargo of AP-4 vesicles. DAGLB is a key enzyme for the generation of 2-AG (2-arachidonoylglycerol), the most abundant endocannabinoid in brain. During normal development, DAGLB is targeted to the axon, where 2-AG signalling drives axonal growth. We show that DAGLB accumulates at the TGN of AP-4-deficient cells, including in iPSC-derived neurons from a patient with AP-4 deficiency syndrome. Our data thus support that AP-4 mediates axonal targeting of DAGLB, and we propose that axon growth defects in AP-4 deficiency may arise through spatial dysregulation of endocannabinoid signalling.",

    "abstract": "The GeneMax (GMX) Advantage test, developed by Zoetis, uses approximately 50,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) to predict the genomic potential of a commercial Angus heifer. Genetic predictions are provided for Calving Ease Maternal, Weaning Weight, Heifer Pregnancy, Milk, Mature Weight, Dry Matter Intake, Carcass Weight, Marbling, Yield, and three economic selection indices. Test results can inform selection and culling decisions made by commercial beef cattle producers. To measure the accuracy of the trait predictions, data from commercial Angus females and their progeny at the University of Missouri Thompson Research Center were utilized to analyze weaning weight, milk, marbling, fat, ribeye area, and carcass weight. Progeny phenotypic data were matched to the respective dam, then the cows genomic predictions were compared to the calfs age-adjusted phenotypes using correlation and linear model effect sizes. All tested GeneMax scores of the dam were significantly correlated with and predicted calf performance. Our predicted effect sizes, except for fat thickness, were similar to those reported by Zoetis. In conclusion, the GeneMax Advantage test accurately ranks animals based on their genetic merit and is an effective selection tool in commercial cowherds.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDeep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) is considered to be the most relevant therapeutic option for patients with severe dystonias, which are thought to arise from a disturbance in striatal control of the GPi, possibly resulting in thalamic disinhibition. The mechanisms of GPi-DBS are far from understood. Hypotheses range from an overall silencing of target nuclei (due to e.g. depolarisation block), via differential alterations in thalamic firing, to disruption of oscillatory activity in the {beta}-range. Although a disturbance of striatal function is thought to play a key role in dystonia, the effects of DBS on cortico-striatal function are unknown.\n\nObjectiveWe hypothesised that DBS, via axonal backfiring, or indirectly via thalamic and cortical coupling, alters striatal network function. We aimed to test this hypothesis in the dtsz-hamster, an animal model of inherited generalised, paroxysmal dystonia.\n\nMethodsHamsters (dtsz-dystonic and non-dystonic controls) were bilaterally implanted with stimulation electrodes targeting the entopeduncular nucleus (EPN, equivalent of human GPi). DBS (130 Hz), and sham DBS, were performed in unanaesthetised animals for 3 hours. Synaptic cortico-striatal field potential responses, as well as miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSC) and firing properties of medium spiny striatal neurons were subsequently recorded in brain slice preparations obtained from these animals immediately after EPN-DBS, to gauge synaptic responsiveness of cortico-striatal projections, their inhibitory control, and striatal neuronal excitability.\n\nResultsDBS increased cortico-striatal responses in slices from control, but not dystonic animals. Inhibitory control of these responses, in turn, was differentially affected: DBS increased inhibitory control in dystonic, and decreased it in healthy tissue. A modulation of presynaptic mechanisms is likely involved, as mEPSC frequency was reduced strongly in dystonic, and less prominently in healthy tissues, while cellular properties of medium-spiny neurons remained unchanged.\n\nConclusionDBS leads to dampening of cortico-striatal communication with restored inhibitory tone.",

    "abstract": "Multiphoton microscopy is one of several new technologies providing unprecedented insight into the activity dynamics and function of neural circuits. Unfortunately, many of these technologies require experimentation in head-restrained animals, greatly limiting the behavioral repertoire that can be studied with each approach. This issue is especially evident in drug addiction research, as no laboratories have coupled multiphoton microscopy with simultaneous intravenous drug self-administration, the gold standard of behavioral paradigms for investigating the neural mechanisms of drug addiction. Such experiments would be transformative for addiction research as one could measure or perturb an array of behavior and drug-related adaptations in precisely defined neural circuit elements over time, including but not limited to dendritic spine plasticity, neurotransmitter release, and neuronal activity. Here, we describe a new experimental assay wherein mice self-administer drugs of abuse while head-restrained, allowing for simultaneous multiphoton imaging. We demonstrate that this approach enables longitudinal tracking of activity in single neurons from the onset of drug use to relapse. The assay can be easily replicated by interested labs for relatively little cost with readily available materials and can provide unprecedented insight into the neural underpinnings of substance use disorder.",

    "abstract": "RNA as an effector of biological functions often adopts secondary and tertiary structural folds. Plasmodium falciparum is a deadly human pathogen responsible for the devastating disease called malaria. In this study, we measured the differential accumulation of RNA secondary structures in coding and noncoding transcripts from the asexual developmental cycle in P. falciparum in human red blood cells. Our comprehensive analysis, combining high-throughput nuclease mapping of RNA structures by duplex RNA-seq, immunoaffinity purification and RNA analysis, collectively measured differentially base-paired RNA regions during the parasite development. Our mapping data not only aligned to a diverse pool of RNAs with known structures but also enabled us to identify new structural RNA regions in the malaria genome. On average, ~71% of the genes with secondary structures are found to be protein coding mRNAs. Mapping pattern of these base-paired RNAs corresponded to all parts of protein-coding mRNAs, including 5 UTR, CDS and 3 UTR. In addition to histone family genes which are known to form secondary structures in their mRNAs, transcripts from genes which are important for transcriptional and post-transcriptional control, such as unique plant-like transcription factor family, ApiAP2, DNA/RNA binding protein family, Alba, ribosomal proteins and eukaryotic initiation factors involved in translational control and the ones important for RBC invasion and cytoadherence also show strong accumulation of duplex RNA reads in various asexual stages. Intriguingly, our study determined a positive relationship between mRNA structural contents and translation efficiency in P. falciparum asexual blood stages, suggesting an essential role of RNA structural changes in malaria gene expression programs.",

    "abstract": "Nosema ceranae is a widespread fungal parasite for adult honeybees, severely damaging bee health and sustainable development of apiculture. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of newly discovered noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) that regulate a number of biological processes such as immune defense and development. In this current work, based on previously obtained whole transcriptome data, 8 199 and 8 711 circRNAs were predicted from the midguts of Apis mellifera ligustica workers at 7 days (AmT1) and 10 days (AmT2) post inoculation (dpi) with N. ceranae using bioinformatics. Additionally, in combination with transcriptome data from uninfected midguts (AmCK1 and AmCK2) (Xiong et al., 2018), 4 464 circRNAs were found to be shared by the aforementioned four groups, whereas the numbers of specifically transcribed circRNAs in each group were 1 389, 1 696, 1 019 and 1 871, respectively. Furthermore, 10 226 circRNAs were homologous to Apis cerana cerana circRNAs, while 20 circRNAs had homology with Homo sapiens circRNAs; in addition, 16 circRNAs were highly conserved in these three species. Differential expression analysis showed that 168 (306) differentially expressed circRNAs (DEcircRNAs) were identified in AmCK1 vs AmT1 (AmCK2 vs AmT2) comparison group, including 61 (143) upregulated circRNAs and 107 (163) downregulated circRNAs. Moreover, RT-qPCR results showed that the expression trend of eight DEcircRNAs was consistent with that of the transcriptome dataset. Based on GO database annotation, we observed that source genes of DEcircRNAs in AmCK1 vs AmT1 (AmCK2 vs AmT2) were engaged in 27 (35) functional terms, including two (two) cell renewal-associated terms, seven (seven) cell structure-associated terms, and one (one) immunity-associated terms. Additionally, DEcircRNA source genes in AmCK1 vs AmT1 were involved in two cell renewal-related pathways, Hippo and Wnt signaling pathways, and three carbohydrate metabolism-related pathways, galactose metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, fructose and mannose metabolism, only one energy metabolism-related pathway (oxidative phosphorylation pathway), three cellular immune-related pathways, endocytosis, phagosome, and lysosome, and a humoral immune-related pathway (FoxO signaling pathway). In AmCK2 vs AmT2 comparison group, more source genes of DEcircRNAs were associated with the abovementioned pathways relative to cell renewal, carbohydrate metabolism, and cellular and humoral immune pathways. In addition, 122 (234) DEcircRNAs in the host midgut at 7 dpi (10 dpi) with N. ceranae targeted 82 (106) miRNAs. Furthermore, 75 (103) miRNAs targeted by 86 (178) DEcircRNAs in AmCK1 vs AmT1 (AmCK2 vs AmT2) further bound to 215 (305) mRNAs. These targets could be annotated as an array of functional terms and pathways related to cellular renewal, cellular structure, carbohydrate and energy metabolism, and cellular and humoral immunity. In a word, we for the first time explored immune responses mediated by DEcircRNAs in the midguts of A. m. ligustica workers to N. ceranae infection. Our data provide a foundation for clarifying the molecular mechanism underlying immune response of western honeybee to N. ceranae invasion, but also a new insight into further understanding the host-pathogen interaction during bee microsporidiosis.",

Here, we describe a label-free method based on quantitative phase microscopy to measure the composition of condensates with an arbitrarily large number of components. We first validate the method empirically in binary mixtures, revealing sequence-encoded density variation and complex aging dynamics for condensates composed of full-length proteins. In simplified multi-component protein/RNA condensates, we uncover a regime of constant condensate density and a large range of protein:RNA stoichiometry when varying average composition. The unexpected decoupling of density and composition highlights the need to determine molecular stoichiometry in multi-component condensates.

    "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains incurable, largely due to its resistance to conventional treatments. Here, we found that increased expression and abundance of the ubiquitin ligase RNF5 contributes to AML development and survival. High RNF5 expression in AML patients correlated with poor prognosis. RNF5 inhibition decreased AML cell growth in culture and in vivo, and blocked development of MLL-AF9-driven leukemogenesis in mice, prolonging their survival. RNF5 inhibition led to transcriptional changes that overlapped with those seen upon HDAC1 inhibition. RNF5 induced the formation of K29 ubiquitin chains on the histone-binding protein RBBP4, promoting its recruitment and subsequent epigenetic regulation of genes involved in AML development and maintenance. Correspondingly, RNF5 or RBBP4 knockdown enhanced the sensitivity of AML cells to histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. Notably, low expression of RNF5 and HDAC coincided with a favorable prognosis. Our studies identified ERAD-independent role for RNF5, demonstrating that its control of RBBP4 constitutes an epigenetic pathway that drives AML while highlighting RNF5/RBBP4 as markers to stratify patients for treatment with HDAC inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Plasticity within the corticostriatal network is known to regulate the balance between behavioral flexibility and automaticity. Repeated training of an action has been shown to bias behavior towards automaticity, suggesting that training may trigger activity-dependent corticostriatal plasticity. However, surprisingly little is known about the natural activity patterns that may drive plasticity or when they occur during long-term training. Here we chronically monitored neural activity from primary motor cortex (M1) and the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) during both training and offline periods, i.e., time away from training including sleep, throughout the development of an automatic reaching action. We first show that blocking striatal NMDA receptors during offline periods prevents the emergence of behavioral consistency, a hallmark of automaticity. We then show that, throughout the development of an automatic reaching action, corticostriatal functional connectivity increases during offline periods. Such increases track the emergence of consistent behavior and predictable cross-area neural dynamics. We then identify sleep spindles during non-REM sleep (NREM) as uniquely poised to mediate corticostriatal plasticity during offline periods. We show that sleep spindles are periods of maximal corticostriatal transmission within offline periods, that sleep spindles in post-training NREM reactivate neurons across areas, and that sleep-spindle modulation in post-training NREM is linked to observable changes in spiking relationships between individual pairs of M1 and DLS neurons. Our results indicate that offline periods, in general, and sleep spindles, specifically, play an important role in regulating behavioral flexibility through corticostriatal network plasticity.",

These results lay the foundation for achieving cell type-specific transgenesis in the primate striatum and provide a blueprint for investigating circuit-specific processing.",

    "abstract": "Knowing when the brain learns is crucial for both the comprehension of memory formation and consolidation, and for developing new training and neurorehabilitation strategies in healthy and patient populations. Recently, a rapid form of offline learning developing during short rest periods has been shown to account for most of procedural learning, leading to the hypothesis that the brain mainly learns during rest between practice periods. Nonetheless, procedural learning has several subcomponents not disentangled in previous studies investigating learning dynamics, such as acquiring the statistical regularities of the task, or else the high-order rules that regulate its organization. Here, we analyzed 506 behavioral sessions of implicit visuomotor deterministic and probabilistic sequence learning tasks, allowing the distinction between general skill learning, statistical learning and high-order rule learning. Our results show that the temporal dynamics of apparently simultaneous learning processes differ. While general skill and high-order rule learning are acquired offline, statistical learning is evidenced online. These findings open new avenues on the short-scale temporal dynamics of learning and memory consolidation and reveal a fundamental distinction between statistical and high-order rule learning, the former benefiting from online evidence accumulation and the latter requiring short rest periods for rapid consolidation.",

    "abstract": "Perineuronal nets (PNNs) surrounding fast-spiking, parvalbumin (PV) inhibitory interneurons are vital for providing excitatory:inhibitory balance within cortical circuits, and this balance is impaired in disorders such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, and substance use disorders. These disorders are also associated with altered diurnal rhythms, yet few studies have examined the diurnal rhythms of PNNs or PV cells. We measured the intensity and number of PV cells and PNNs labeled with Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) in the rat prelimbic medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) at Zeitgeber times (ZT) ZT0, 6, 12, and 18. We also measured the oxidative stress marker 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG). Relative to ZT0, the intensities of PNN and PV staining were increased in the dark (active) phase compared with the light (inactive) phase. The intensity of 8-oxo-dG was decreased from ZT0 at all time points (ZT6,12,18), in both PV cells and non-PV cells. To examine corresponding changes in inhibitory and excitatory inputs, we measured GAD 65/67 and vGlut1 puncta apposed to PV cells with and without PNNs. Relative to ZT6, there were more excitatory puncta on PV cells surrounded by PNNs at ZT18, but no changes in PV cells devoid of PNNs. No changes in inhibitory puncta were observed. Whole-cell slice recordings in fast-spiking (PV) cells with PNNs showed an increased ratio of -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor:N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (AMPA:NMDA) at ZT18 vs. ZT6. The number of PV cells and co-labeled PV/PNN cells containing the transcription factor orthodenticle homeobox 2 (OTX2), which maintains PNNs, showed a strong trend toward an increase from ZT6 to ZT18. These diurnal fluctuations in PNNs and PV cells are expected to alter cortical excitatory:inhibitory balance and provide new insights into treatment approaches for diseases impacted by imbalances in sleep and circadian rhythms.",

    "abstract": "The KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KHSRP) is an RNA-binding protein linked to decay of AU-rich element containing mRNAs. We have previously shown that KHSRP destabilizes the mRNA encoding the growth-associated protein GAP-43 and decreases neurite growth in cultured embryonic neurons. In contrast, loss of KHSRP stabilizes Gap43 mRNA and increases neurite growth. Here, we have tested functions of neural KHSRP in vivo. We find upregulation of 1460 mRNAs in the neocortex of adult Khsrp-/- mice, of which 527 bind to KHSRP with high specificity. These KHSRP targets are involved in pathways for neuronal morphology, axon guidance, neurotransmission and long-term memory. Neocortical neurons show increased axon growth and dendritic spine density in Khsrp-/- mice. Analyses of neuronal cultures from embryonic Khsrp-/- mice point to a neuron-intrinsic alteration in axonal and dendritic growth and elevations in KHSRP-target mRNAs, including subcellularly localized mRNAs. Hippocampus and infralimbic cortex of Khsrp-/- mice show presynaptic elevations in neurotransmission. The Khsrp-/- mice have significant deficits in both trace conditioning and attention set-shifting tasks compared Khsrp+/+ mice, indicating impaired prefrontal- and hippocampal-dependent memory consolidation with loss of KHSRP. Overall, our results indicate that prenatal deletion of KHSRP impairs neuronal development resulting in alterations in neuronal morphology and function by changing post-transcriptional control of neuronal gene expression.",

Allosteric mechanisms predominated, with one peptide selectively inhibiting C5 cleavage by the alternative pathway C5 convertase, revealing a targetable mechanistic difference between the classical and alternative pathway C5 convertases. Taking a hybrid biophysical approach, we present C5-knob domain co-crystal structures and, by solution methods, observed allosteric effects propagating >50 [A] from the binding sites.

    "abstract": "BackgroundA Cross sectional study of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Corona virus (MERS-CoV) in Camel was conducted between February 2018 to April 2019 in three selected sites of Amibara district of Afar region, Northeast Ethiopia. The study was aimed to observe the current sero-prevalence status of MERS-CoV, assess the presence of active cases through detection RNA Viral particle and investigate possible risk factors of MERS-CoV in camels. A total of 589 sera were collected and tested with indirect Enzyme linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (iELISA).\n\nResultThe overall seroprevalance of MERS-CoV was 87.3% (n=514/589, 95% CI: 84.5-89.9). Association of different risk factors with seroprevalance revealed that origin (X2=13.39,P=0.001), sex (X2=4.5 P=0.034), age ((X2=185.7, P=0.001) season (X2=41.7, P=0.000) and reproduction status (X2=96.1, P=0.001) displayed a statistical significant difference among the groups (P<0.05) while herd size did not show a Significant difference among groups (p>0.05). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, age (OR=7.39, 95% CI:3.43-15.91), season (OR=4.83, 95% CI:-2.14-10.90), and in adult female camel reproduction status (OR=7.39,95% C I:3.43-15.91) showed statistically significant difference among the groups for MERS CoV antibody detection while risk factors of origin, animal sex and herd size difference were statistically insignificant. A total of 857 nasal swab samples were collected for the detection of MERS-CoV RNA particle. However, all swab samples tested by Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique were Negative for the virus.\n\nConclusionIn conclusion, the present study revealed a high seroprevalance of MERS CoV in adult camels. However, in spite of high seroprevalance the lack of any RNA viral particle in the study suggests the need for further in depth longitudinal study to detect the circulating virus focusing on juveniles and young camels whereby seroprevalance of antibody is low when compared with adult camel in order to get the active virus before the camel develop antibody. Moreover, the zoonotic significance and potential transmission routes of MERS CoV to pastoral communities should also be investigated and design strategy for the preparedness in control of the diseases in Ethiopia.",

    "abstract": "O_LIIncreasingly severe forest fires are recruiting more heavily burned wood into streams. Wood affects every ecological and physical process in streams differently throughout seasons. However, little is known about the seasonality of wood functions in fire-prone biomes and how it combines with wood burning level to guide future postfire restoration efforts.\nC_LIO_LIThrough an extensive three-year seasonal tracking of stream wood following forest fires in central Portugal, we examined for the first time the influence of burning level, season, and a large suite of driving factors on the likelihood of each of four functions with primary ecological consequences -- retention of organic matter, serving as substrate for aquatic biota, being key pieces forming wood jams, and deflecting flow including pool habitat formation.\nC_LIO_LIOur results strongly support that one of the main ecological functions of wood in rivers, i.e. to provide substrate for biological organisms -- namely for vegetation, periphyton, biofilms, and ovipositions -- can be negatively affected in heavily burned wood.\nC_LIO_LIExcept for jam formation, the probability of each stream wood function changed markedly with season and the probability of non-function was nearly twice as high in the Euro-Mediterranean dry as in the wet season.\nC_LIO_LIMore anchored and decayed wood increased the probability of all functions, whereas the effect of submergence depended on the function. Challenging the \"size paradigm\" assuming larger-sized pieces to provide more function, our data suggest the effect of size to be function-specific.\nC_LIO_LISynthesis and applications. We show how postfire restoration success can be maximized by selecting the most appropriate wood, taking advantage of attribute-function relationships and choosing the right timing for operations. We urge managers to refrain from removing wood or to selectively remove the most heavily carbonized only, allowing the persistence of great potential to provide substrate for stream biota. The non-attraction of heavily burned wood as substrate can be compensated for by other wood with attributes enhancing this function, such as wood deeper within the bankfull area, and with large diameters. These results help to inform successful management, as is increasingly asked from restoration ecology.\nC_LI",
