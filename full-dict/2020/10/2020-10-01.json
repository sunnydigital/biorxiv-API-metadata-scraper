    "abstract": "0The prediction of sensory feedback is known to involve the cerebellum, but its precise nature and timing have remained unclear due to the scarcity of time-sensitive cerebellar neuroimaging studies. We here, using magnetoencephalography in human participants, investigated the working hypothesis that one function of the cerebellum is to predict exactly when rhythmic stimuli are expected to impinge on sensory receptors.\n\nWe compared the cerebellums response between somatosensory omissions embedded in perfectly rhythmic versus jittered trains of stimulation. At the precise moment that an omitted stimulus would have appeared, the cerebellum exhibited a beta band (14-30 Hz) response that was stronger when preceded by a perfectly rhythmic sequence. Meanwhile, the rhythm of new stimulation sequences induced theta band (4-7 Hz) activity in the cerebellum.\n\nOur results provide evidence that the cerebellum acts as a clock that entrains to rhythmic stimuli, likely for the purpose of detecting any deviations from that rhythm.",

    "abstract": "Treg are critical regulators of immune homeostasis, and increasing evidence demonstrates that environment-driven Treg differentiation into effector (e)Treg is crucial for optimal functioning. However, human Treg programming under inflammatory conditions remains poorly understood. Here, we combine transcriptional and epigenetic profiling to identify the human eTreg core signature. Functional autoimmune inflammation-derived Treg display a unique transcriptional profile characterized by upregulation of both a core Treg (FOXP3, CTLA-4, TIGIT) and effector program (GITR, BLIMP-1, BATF). We identified a specific human eTreg signature that includes the vitamin D receptor (VDR) as predicted key-regulator in eTreg differentiation. H3K27ac/H3K4me1 occupancy revealed pronounced changes in the (super-)enhancer landscape, including enrichment of the binding motif for VDR and BATF. The observed Treg profile showed striking overlap with tumor-infiltrating Treg. Our data demonstrate that human inflammation-derived Treg acquire a specific eTreg profile guided by epigenetic changes. The core eTreg profile is conserved, and fine-tuned by environment-specific adaptations.",

    "abstract": "Interleukin-13 plays a critical role in mediating many biological processes responsible for allergic inflammation. Mast cells express Il13 mRNA and produce IL-13 protein in response to antigenic stimulation. Enhancers are essential in promoting gene transcription and are thought to activate transcription by delivering essential accessory co-factors to the promoter to potentiate gene transcription. However, enhancers mediating Il13 have not been identified. Furthermore, which Il13 enhancers detect signals triggered by antigenic stimulation have not yet been defined. In this study, we identified potential Il13 enhancers using histone modification monomethylation at lysine residue 4 on histone 3 (H3K4me1) ChIP-seq and acetylation at lysine residue 27 on histone 3 (H3K27ac) ChIP-seq. We used Omni-ATAC-seq to determine which accessible regions within the potential Il13 enhancers that responded to IgE receptor crosslinking. We also demonstrated that the transcription factor (TF) cluster consisting of the NFATC2, STAT5, GATA2, AP1, and RUNX1 binding sites at the proximal Il13 enhancer, the TF cluster consisting of the EGR2-binding site at the distal Il13 E+6.5 enhancer, are critical in sensing the signals triggered by antigenic stimulation. Those enhancers, which are responsive to antigenic stimulation and constitutively active, cooperate to generate greater transcriptional outputs. Our study reveals a novel mechanism underlying how antigenic stimulation induces robust Il13 mRNA expression in mast cells.",

It is unclear if the microbiota can influence the manifestation of diarrhea during a Cryptosporidium infection.\n\nMethodsTo characterize the role of the gut microbiota in diarrheal cryptosporidiosis, the microbiome composition of both diarrheal and surveillance Cryptosporidium-positive fecal samples was evaluated using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Additionally, the microbiome composition prior to infection was examined to test whether a preexisting microbiome profile could influence the Cryptosporidium infection phenotype.\n\nResultsFecal microbiome composition was associated with diarrheal symptoms at two timepoints. Megasphaera was significantly less abundant in diarrheal samples when compared to subclinical samples at the time of Cryptosporidium detection (log2(fold change) = -4.3, p=10-10) and prior to infection (log2(fold change) = -2.0, p=10-4). Random forest classification also identified Megasphaera abundance in the pre- and post-exposure microbiota.as predictive of a subclinical infection.\n\nConclusionsMicrobiome composition broadly, and specifically low Megasphaera abundance, was associated with diarrheal symptoms prior to and at the time of Cryptosporidium detection. This observation suggests that the gut microenvironment may play a role in determining the severity of a Cryptosporidium infection.\n\nSummaryMegasphaera abundance in the stool of Bangladeshi infants is associated with the development of diarrhea upon infection with the Cryptosporidium parasite.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) are a rich source of genetic variability. Among TEs, Miniature Inverted- repeat Transposable Elements (MITEs) are of particular interest as they are present in high copy numbers in plant genomes and are closely associated with genes. MITEs are deletion derivatives of class II transposons, and can be mobilized by the transposases encoded by the latters through a typical cut-and-paste mechanism. However, this mechanism cannot account for the high copy number MITEs attain in plant genomes, and the mechanism by which MITEs amplify remains elusive.\n\nWe present here an analysis of 103,109 Transposon Insertion Polymorphisms (TIPs) in 1,059 O. sativa genomes representing the main rice population groups. We show that an important fraction of MITE insertions has been fixed in rice concomitantly with rice domestication. However, another fraction of MITE insertions is present at low frequencies. We performed MITE TIP-GWAS to study the impact of these elements on agronomically important traits and found that these elements uncover more trait associations than SNPs on important phenotypes such as grain width. Finally, using SNP-GWAS and TIP-GWAS we provide evidences of the replicative amplification of MITEs, suggesting a mechanism of amplification uncoupled from the typical cut-and-paste mechanism of class II transposons.",

In this study, we discovered that miR-375 is among the most enriched miRNAs in intestinal crypts and stem cells (ISCs), especially facultative ISCs. We then showed by multiple manipulations, including CRISPR/Cas9 editing, that miR-375 is strongly suppressed by Wnt-signaling. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of SI crypt-enriched cells from miR-375 knockout (375-KO) mice revealed elevated numbers of tuft cells and increased expression of pro-proliferative genes in ISCs. Accordingly, the genetic loss of miR-375 promoted resistance to helminth infection and enhanced the regenerative response to irradiation. The conserved effects of miR-375 were confirmed by gain-of-function studies in Drosophila midgut stem cells in vivo. Moreover, functional experiments in enteroids uncovered a regulatory relationship between miR-375 and Yap1 that controls cell survival.

    "abstract": "Innate immunity requires a balance of positive and negative regulators of cytokine transcription. Keap1 deletion in mice alters innate immunity and inflammation. We investigated the influence of Keap1 on cytokine gene induction by Sendai virus infection in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). Keap1 bound to the Ifnb1, Tnf and Il6 promoters upon virus infection, and moderated viral induction of their transcription. Keap1 was required for viral induction of NF{kappa}B p50 and G9a-GLP lysine methyltransferase binding to these genes. Keap1 formed BiFC complexes with NF{kappa}B p50 that were localized to the nuclei in a subset of cells. Nrf2 counteracted viral induction of Keap1 binding to the promoters, and the effects of Keap1 on NF{kappa}B p50 and on G9a-GLP recruitment. Lysine methyltransferase inhibitors enhanced viral induction of transcription of the genes that were bound by Keap1 only in MEFs with intact Keap1, and not in Keap1-/- MEFs. They also enhanced NF{kappa}B p50 and NF{kappa}B p65 recruitment to these genes only in MEFs with intact Keap1, whereas they inhibited G9a-GLP recruitment. The reciprocal effects of Keap1 and of G9a-GLP lysine methyltransferase activity on chromatin binding by each other constitute a feedback circuit that moderates viral induction of cytokine transcription.\n\nSummaryVirus infection induces Keap1 binding to cytokine promoters, which recruits NF{kappa}B p50 and G9a-GLP and moderates their transcription.",

    "abstract": "Excessive synthesis of type I collagen characterizes fibrotic diseases. Binding of LARP6 to the 5 stem-loop (5SL) of collagen mRNAs regulates their translation and the high rate of biosynthesis in fibrosis. LARP6 needs two domains to form stable complex with 5SL RNA, the La-domain and the juxtaposed RRM domain (jointly called the La-module). We describe that the La-domain of LARP6 is necessary and sufficient for recognition of 5SL in sequence specific manner. The three amino acid motif, RNK, located in the flexible loop which connects the second -helix to the {beta}-sheet of the La domain is critical for binding. Mutation of any of these three amino acids abolishes the binding of La-domain to 5SL. The major site of crosslinking of LARP6 to 5SL RNA was mapped to this motif. The RNK motif is not found in other LARPs, which can not bind 5SL. Presence of RRM increases the stability of complex between La-domain and 5SL RNA and RRM domain does not make extensive contacts with 5SL RNA. We propose a model in which the initial recognition of 5SL by LARP6 is mediated by the RNK epitope and further stabilized by the RRM domain. This discovery suggests that the interaction between LARP6 and collagen mRNAs can be blocked by small molecules that target the RNK epitope and will help rational design of the LARP6 binding inhibitors as specific antifibrotic drugs.",

    "abstract": "Vision begins when light is captured by the outer segment organelle of photoreceptor cells in the retina. Outer segments are modified cilia filled with hundreds of flattened disc-shaped membranes. Disc membranes are separated from the surrounding plasma membrane and each membrane type has unique protein components. The mechanisms underlying this protein sorting remain entirely unknown. In this study, we investigated the outer segment delivery of the rod cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel, which is located in the outer segment plasma membrane where it mediates the electrical response to light. We now show that the targeted delivery of the CNG channel to the outer segment requires pre-assembly of its constituent 1 and {beta}1 subunits and that CNG{beta}1 contains specific targeting information encoded within the glutamic acid-rich region of its N-terminal GARP domain. We also found that the GARP domain connects the CNG channel to photoreceptor disc rims likely through an interaction with peripherin-2 and demonstrated that this function is performed by a proline-enriched region adjacent to the GARP domain. Our data reveal fine functional specializations within the structural domains of the CNG channel and suggest that channel delivery to the outer segment is independent of peripherin-2 interactions.\n\nSignificance StatementThe precise delivery and organization of signaling proteins in the ciliary outer segment organelle of photoreceptor cells is critical for light detection. We report that the CNG channel, mediating the electrical response to light in rods, contains a region within the N-terminus of its CNG{beta}1 subunit that encodes the outer segment targeting information for the entire channel. This targeting region is adjacent to a region that connects CNG{beta}1 to the rims of photoreceptor discs, likely determining the subcellular compartmentalization of the CNG channel into the outer segment plasma membrane.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle has the intrinsic ability to self-repair through a multifactorial process, but many aspects of its cellular and molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. There is increasing evidence that some members of the mammalian {beta}-galactoside-binding protein family (galectins) are involved in the muscular repair process (MRP), including galectin-3 (Gal-3). However, there are many questions about the role of this protein on muscle self-repair. Here, we demonstrate that endogenous Gal-3 is required for: i) muscle repair in vivo using a chloride-barium myolesion mouse model, and ii) mouse primary myoblasts myogenic programming. Injured muscle from Gal-3 knockout mice (GAL3KO) showed persistent inflammation associated with compromised muscle repair and the formation of fibrotic tissue on the lesion site. In GAL3KO mice, osteopontin expression remained high even after 7 and 14 days of the myolesion, while MyoD and myogenin had decreased their expression. In GAL3KO mouse primary myoblast cell culture, Pax7 detection seems to sustain even when cells are stimulated to differentiation and MyoD expression is drastically reduced. These findings suggest that the detection and temporal expression levels of these transcriptional factors appear to be altered in Gal-3-deficient myoblast cell culture compared to Wild Type (WT) cells. We observed Gal-3 expression in WT states, both in vivo and in vitro, in sarcoplasm/cytoplasm and myonuclei; as differentiation proceeds, Gal-3 expression is drastically reduced, and its location is confined to the sarcolemma/plasma cell membrane. We also observed a change in the temporal-spatial profile of Gal-3 expression and muscle transcription factors levels during the myolesion. Overall, these results demonstrate that endogenous Gal-3 is required for the skeletal muscle repair process.",

We show that Longshanks skulls became longer, flatter, and narrower in a stepwise process. Moreover, we show that these morphological changes likely resulted from developmental changes in the growth plates of the Longshanks cranial base, mirroring changes observed in its tibia. Thus, indirect and non-adaptive morphological changes can occur due to developmental overlap among distant skeletal elements, with important implications for interpreting the evolutionary history of vertebrate skeletal form.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is predicted to have a negative effect on the grasslands of the United States and will be detrimental to the economy and environment. The changing precipitation levels would also have an effect on the structural and functional potential of associated soil microbiome communities, which in turn will regulate the health of the plants during stressful conditions. In this study, we applied metagenomics analyses to capture the responses of the bacterial populations under drier soil conditions. We collected soil from two sites (dry and wet) at the Konza Long-Term Ecological Research field station in Kansas, which had characteristic features of the native prairies. Soil drying resulted in a significant shift in the bacterial population at the community level. Following that, fifteen bacterial genomes were short-listed based on the availability in the public database, higher relative abundance in dry soils than in wet, and also according to their contributions in drier soil. The potential microbial mechanisms were elucidated when an in-depth analysis of the functional genes was performed. Translation elongation factor EF-Tu, thiamine biosynthesis protein, and catalase were identified as a part of the overall stress functional responses in the bacterial population in this study. We speculate that these identified bacterial populations are important for maintaining the health of the soil under dry conditions. Genes and/or pathways found in this study provide insights into microbial mechanisms that these bacterial populations might employ to resist challenging drought conditions.",

    "abstract": "Oxytocin (OT) neurons regulate diverse physiological responses via direct connections with different neural circuits. However, the lack of comprehensive input-output wiring diagrams of OT neurons and their quantitative relationship with OT receptor (OTR) expression presents challenges to understanding circuit specific OT functions. Here, we establish a whole-brain distribution and anatomical connectivity map of OT neurons, and their relationship with OTR expression using cell type specific viral tools and high-resolution 3D mapping methods. We utilize a flatmap to describe OT neuronal expression in four hypothalamic domains including under-characterized OT neurons in the tuberal nucleus. OT neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) broadly project to nine functional circuits that control cognition, brain state, and somatic visceral response. In contrast, OT neurons in the supraoptic (SO) and accessory nuclei have limited central projection to a small subset of the nine circuits. Surprisingly, quantitative comparison between OT output and OTR expression showed no significant correlation across the whole brain, suggesting abundant indirect OT signaling in OTR expressing areas. Unlike output, OT neurons in both the PVH and SO receive similar mono-synaptic inputs from a subset of the nine circuits mainly in the thalamic, hypothalamic, and cerebral nuclei areas. Our results suggest that PVH-OT neurons serve as a central modulator to integrate external and internal information via largely reciprocal connection with the nine circuits while the SO-OT neurons act mainly as unidirectional OT hormonal output. In summary, our OT wiring diagram provides anatomical insights about distinct behavioral functions of OT signaling in the brain.\n\nSignificance StatementOxytocin (OT) neurons regulate diverse physiological functions from pro-social behavior to pain sensation via central projection in the brain. Thus, understanding detailed anatomical connectivity of OT neurons can provide insight on circuit specific roles of OT signaling in regulating different physiological functions. Here, we utilize high resolution mapping methods to describe the 3D distribution, mono-synaptic input and long-range output of OT neurons, and their relationship with OT receptor (OTR) expression across the entire mouse brain. We found OT connections with nine functional circuits controlling cognition, brain state, and somatic visceral response. Furthermore, we identified a quantitatively unmatched OT-OTR relationship, suggesting broad indirect OT signaling. Together, our comprehensive OT wiring diagram advances our understanding of circuit specific roles of OT neurons.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological studies suggest a link between type-2 diabetes and Parkinsons disease (PD) risk. Treatment of type-2 diabetes with insulin sensitizing drugs lowers the risk of PD. We previously showed that the insulin sensitizing drug, MSDC-0160, ameliorates pathogenesis in some animal models of PD. MSDC-0160 reversibly binds the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) protein complex, which has an anti-inflammatory effect and restores metabolic deficits. Since PD is characterized by the deposition of -synuclein (Syn), we hypothesized that inhibiting the MPC might directly inhibit Syn aggregation in vivo in mammals. To answer if modulation of MPC can reduce the development of Syn assemblies, and reduce neurodegeneration, we treated two chronic and progressive mouse models; a viral vector-based Syn overexpressing model and a pre-formed fibril (PFF) Syn seeding model with MSDC-0160. These two models present with distinct types of Syn pathology but lack inflammatory or autophagy deficits. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that a modulation of MPC in these models did not reduce the accumulation Syn aggregates or mitigate neurotoxicity. Instead, MSDC-0160 changed the post-translational modification and aggregation features of the Syn. These results are consistent with the lack of a direct effect on MPC modulation on synuclein clearance in these models.",

For example, speech and music play a unique role in human hearing, yet it is unclear how auditory representations of speech and music differ between humans and other animals. Using functional Ultrasound imaging, we measured responses in ferrets to a set of natural and spectrotemporally-matched synthetic sounds previously tested in humans. Ferrets showed similar lower-level frequency and modulation tuning to that observed in humans. But while humans showed prominent selectivity for natural vs. synthetic speech and music in non-primary regions, ferret responses to natural and synthetic sounds were closely matched throughout primary and non-primary auditory cortex, even when tested with ferret vocalizations. This finding reveals that auditory representations in humans and ferrets diverge sharply at late stages of cortical processing, potentially driven by higher-order processing demands in speech and music.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal excitability is tightly regulated, requiring rapidly activating and inactivating voltage-gated sodium channels to allow accurate temporal encoding of information. Alternative splicing greatly broadens the repertoire of channels, but the adaptive significance of this phenomenon is incompletely understood. An alternative splicing event that is conserved across vertebrates affects part of the first domain of sodium channels and modulates their availability after inactivation. Here we use this conserved splicing event to ask whether this modulation has consistent effects in different neuronal backgrounds, or whether a conserved splicing event can be exploited to produce distinct effects in different cell types. We show that the consequences of alternate splicing of human Nav1.1 and Nav1.2 for neuronal activity depend on whether they are expressed in the cell types where they normally predominate (interneurons or excitatory neurons, respectively). Splicing in the  adult isoform in both channels is sufficient to slow action potential rise times in all neurons. However, changes to both action potential half width and maximal firing rate are specific to cell type and channel, with each channel appearing tuned to mediate effects in its predominant neuronal background. Finally, we use dynamic clamp to demonstrate that alternative splicing in Nav1.1 changes how interneurons fire during epileptiform events. Our data show that, for sodium channels, despite conserved amino acid changes and similar effects on channel gating, alternative splicing has distinct impacts on neuronal properties, thus highlighting how closely sodium channels are tuned to distinct cellular backgrounds.",

We demonstrate that these unconventional responses resulted from a chance genetic rearrangement in 68-1 RhCMV that abrogated the function of eight distinct immunomodulatory gene products encoded in two RhCMV genomic regions (Rh157.5/.4 and Rh158-161). Differential repair of these genes with either RhCMV-derived or orthologous human CMV (HCMV)-derived sequences (UL128/130; UL146/147) leads to either of two distinct CD8+ T cell response types - MHC-Ia-restricted-only, or a mix of MHC-II- and MHC-Ia-restricted CD8+ T cells. Despite response magnitude and functional differentiation being similar to RhCMV 68-1, neither alternative response type mediated protection against SIV challenge. These findings implicate MHC-E-restricted CD8+ T cell responses as mediators of anti-SIV efficacy and indicate that translation of RhCMV/SIV vector efficacy to humans will likely require deletion of all the genes that inhibit these responses from the HCMV/HIV vector.\n\nOne-sentence summaryEight genes in two spatially distinct RhCMV gene regions control induction of unconventionally restricted CD8+ T cell responses and the efficacy of RhCMV/SIV vaccine vectors against SIV challenge.",

Despite high industrial relevance owing to broad bioactive potential of these metabolites, their ecological roles remain largely unexplored. We analyze all available genomes for BGCs of phage origin. The BGCs predominantly reside within temperate phages infecting certain commensal and pathogenic bacteria. Nearly all phage BGCs encode bacteriocins, which appear to serve as a strong proxy for phage specificity. Using the gut-associated bacterium Bacillus subtilis, we demonstrate how a temperate phage equips its host with a functional BGC, providing it with a competitive fitness advantage over close relatives. Therefore, certain temperate phages use BGCs to weaponize their bacteria against close relatives, leading to evolutionary benefits from lysogeny to the infected host, and hence, to the phage itself. Our study is a large step towards understanding the natural role of specialized metabolites, as well as mutualistic phage-host relationships.",

    "abstract": "The inner nuclear membrane is functionalized by diverse transmembrane proteins that associate with nuclear lamins and/or chromatin. When cells enter mitosis, membrane-chromatin contacts must be broken to allow for proper chromosome segregation; yet how this occurs remains ill-understood. Unexpectedly, we observed that an imbalance in the levels of the lamina-associated polypeptide 1 (LAP1), an activator of ER-resident Torsin AAA+-ATPases, causes a failure in membrane removal from mitotic chromatin, accompanied by chromosome segregation errors and changes in post-mitotic nuclear morphology. These defects are dependent on a hitherto unknown chromatin-binding region of LAP1 that we have delineated. LAP1-induced NE abnormalities are efficiently suppressed by expression of wild-type but not ATPase-deficient Torsins. Furthermore, a dominant-negative Torsin induces chromosome segregation defects in a LAP1-dependent manner. These results indicate that association of LAP1 with chromatin in the nucleus can be modulated by Torsins in the perinuclear space, shedding new light on the LAP1-Torsin interplay.",

All animals were kept under standard conditions and received the same feed for pregnant females. In contrast, females from the HMB group between 70 and 90 days were supplemented with 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyle in the amount of 0.2g/kg b.w/day. Immediately after birth, the piglets were also divided into groups based on: sex, and presence or lack HMB supplementation, and subsequently were euthanized and humerus bones from all piglets were collected.\n\nMothers HMB supplementation during pregnancy affected the multiple index of their offspring. The higher humerus mass and length was observed with the greater effect in males. Maternal supplementation also influenced on the geometrical and mechanical properties of the humerus as in the case of mass, this effect was higher in males.

Maternal supplementation also affected the expression of selected proteins in growth cartilage and trabecular bone. The obtained results show that the administration to the mother during pregnancy by the HMB significantly affects the development of the humerus in many ways. The obtained results also confirm the utility of such experiments in understanding of the importance of the pregnancy diet as an develop and adaptable factor of offspring organisms and are the base for further research in that area as well as in the protein markers expression area.",

Considering the potential technologies for crop improvement could close the rooms of poverty in developing countries in particular and around the globe at large. This review aimed to assess the site-directed mutation creation methods and to show the potential tools for future crop improvement programs. Site-directed mutagenesis was found to be an efficient process to create targeted mutation on cereal crops, horticultural crops, oilseed crops, and others. Agronomic traits such as yield, quality, and stress tolerance have been improved using site-directed mutagenesis. Besides, selectable marker elimination was also reported from transgenic crops by targeted mutation. Most of the reports on site-directed mutagenesis is focusing on cereal crops (58.339%) followed by horticultural crops (22.92%). Among the four mutagenic tools that have been reported, the CRISPR/Ca9 technology was found to be frequently used (66.67%) followed by TALENs. This tool is potential since it is efficient in creating targeted mutagenesis and less likely off-target effect, so it is repeatedly used in different research works. TALENs were used usually to knockout genes with bad traits. Moreover, the mutation created by mutagenic tools found to be efficient, and the mutated traits proved as it was heritable to generations. Hence, site-directed mutagenesis by the CRISPR/Cas9 system is advisable for agricultural development thereby ensuring food sustainability around the world.",

Further investigation revealed that lymph glands and circulating hemocytes from egr3 mutant larvae were completely devoid of NimC1 staining, a marker of phagocytic hemocytes. Genome sequencing uncovered mutations in the NimC1 coding region that are predicted to truncate the NimC1 protein before its transmembrane domain, and provide an explanation for the lack of NimC staining. The work that we report here demonstrates the presence of these NimC1 mutations in the widely used egr3 mutant, its sister allele, egr1, and its parental strain, Regg1GS9830.

    "abstract": "Members of the differential screening-selected gene aberrative in neuroblastoma (DAN) protein family are developmentally conserved extracellular binding proteins that antagonize bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. This protein family includes the Gremlin proteins, GREM1 and GREM2, which are known to have key functions during embryogenesis and adult physiology. While BMPs play essential roles in adult female reproductive physiology, the role of the DAN family in ovarian function is less understood. We generated mice null for Grem2 to study its role in female fertility in addition to screening patients with primary ovarian insufficiency for variants in GREM2. Grem2-/- mice are viable and female Grem2-/- mice have diminished fecundity and irregular estrous cycles. This is accompanied by reduced serum levels of anti-Mullerian hormone, a marker of the ovarian reserve, in adult mice. Alterations in ovarian expression of inhibin and activin subunit genes, which are required for regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis, were identified. While Grem2 mRNA transcript was not detected in the pituitary, Grem2 was expressed in the hypothalami of wild type female mice. Additionally, screening 106 women with primary ovarian insufficiency identified one individual with a heterozygous variant in GREM2 that lies within the predicted BMP-GREM2 interface. In total, these data suggest that Grem2 is necessary for female fecundity by playing a novel role in regulating the HPO axis and possibly contributing to female reproductive disease.",

    "abstract": "Physical stress, such as from the cold-pressor test, has been robustly associated with altered memory retrieval, but it is not yet clear whether the same happens following psychosocial stress. Studies using psychosocial stressors report mixed effects on memory, leading to uncertainty about the common cognitive impact of both forms of stress. The current study uses a stepped replication design, with four near-identical experiments, each differing by a single critical factor. In three experiments we induced psychosocial stress after participants encoded word stimuli, then assessed retrieval after a prolonged delay. These experiments found no group level influence of postencoding stress on recognition of neutral words or cued recall of word-pairs, but a small effect on recollection of semantically-related words. There was, however, some indication of positive relationships within the stress group between measures of stress (cortisol in experiment 1 and self-reported-anxiety in experiment 3) and recollection of single word stimuli. In the fourth experiment, we found that psychosocial stress immediately before retrieval did not influence word recognition. Overall, our findings demonstrate that psychosocial stress has a typically modest impact on memory, lower than previously claimed, but that individual differences in stress responsivity, particularly for tasks that tap recollection, may help to explain variability in previous findings.",

    "abstract": "Transplantation of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons for the treatment of Parkinsons disease (PD) is a strategy that has being extensively explored and clinical trials using fetal and stem cell-derived DA neurons are ongoing. An increased understanding of the mechanisms promoting the generation of distinct subtypes of midbrain DA during normal development will be essential for guiding future efforts to precisely generate molecularly defined and subtype specific DA neurons from pluripotent stem cells. In this study, we used droplet-based scRNA-seq to transcriptionally profile a large number of fetal cells from human embryos at different stages of ventral midbrain (VM) development (6, 8, and 11 weeks post conception). This revealed that the emergence of transcriptionally distinct cellular populations was evident already at these early timepoints. To study late events of human DA differentiation and functional maturation, we established a primary fetal 3D culture system that recapitulates key molecular aspects of late human DA neurogenesis and sustains differentiation and functional maturation of DA neurons in a physiologically relevant cellular context. This approach allowed us to define the molecular identities of distinct human DA progenitors and neurons at single cell resolution and construct developmental trajectories of cell types in the developing fetal VM.\n\nOverall these findings provide a unique transcriptional profile of developing fetal VM and functionally mature human DA neurons, which can be used to quality control stem cell-derived DA neurons and guide stem cell-based therapies and disease modeling approaches in PD.",

    "abstract": "Glycosylation is essential to brain development and function, though prior studies have often been limited to a single analytical technique. Using several methodologies, we analyzed Asn-linked (N-glycans) and Ser/Thr/Tyr-linked (O-glycans) protein glycosylation between brain regions and sexes in mice. Brain N-glycans were surprisingly less complex in sequence and variety compared to other tissues, consisting predominantly of high-mannose precursors and fucosylated/bisected structures. Most brain O-glycans were unbranched, sialylated O-GalNAc and O-mannose structures. A consistent pattern was observed between regions, and sex differences were minimal compared to those observed in plasma. Brain glycans correlate with RNA expression of their synthetic enzymes, and analysis of all glycosylation genes in humans showed a global downregulation in the brain compared to other tissues. We hypothesize that the restricted repertoire of protein glycans arises from their tight regulation in the brain. These results provide a roadmap for future studies of glycosylation in neurodevelopment and disease.",

    "abstract": "The immune response towards infection is a dynamic system combating invading pathogens to maintain homeostasis and the integrity of the body. Unbalanced immune response profiles determine many clinical syndromes including sepsis and thus present a major challenge in management of life threatening infections. Consequently, there is a high demand to determine a patients immune status and identifying functional parameters for immune dysfunction.\n\nHere, we quantified the global functional status of human innate immune responses by using a human whole-blood model of infection combined with biomathematical modeling. By determining functional parameters of innate immune cell populations after ex vivo whole-blood bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus) and fungal (Candida albicans) infection, we examined cell-specific functional parameters including migration rates or phagocytosis rates in patients that underwent cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation. This intervention is known to pose a transient but strong inflammatory stimulus. In addition to a post-operative increase in white blood cell count mainly caused by mobilization of immature neutrophils we find that the surgery induced pro-inflammatory stimulus results in a mitigation of pathogen-specific response patterns that are characteristic for healthy people and baseline results in our patients. Moreover, our model revealed changing rates for pathogen immune evasion, indicating increased inter-pathogenic differences after surgery. This effect was specific for C. albicans and could not be observed for S. aureus. In summary, our model gives insight into immune functionality and might serve as a functional immune assay to record and evaluate innate response patterns towards infection.\n\nAuthor summaryAssessment of a patients immune function is critical in many clinical situations. One prominent example is sepsis, which results from a loss of immune homeostasis due to microbial infection. Sepsis is characterized by a plethora of pro- and anti-inflammatory simuli that may occur consecutively or simultaneously and thus any immunomodulatory therapy would require in depth knowledge of an individual patients immune status at a given time. Whereas lab-test based immune profiling often relies solely on quantification of cell numbers, we have used an ex vivo whole-blood infection model in combination with biomathematical modeling to quantify functional parameters of innate immune cells in patient blood. A small blood sample of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, which is known to constitute an inflammatory stimulus was infected ex vivo. Functional immune cell parameters were determined using a combination of experimental assays and biomathematical modeling. We show that these parameters change after an inflammatory insult triggered by cardiac surgery and extracorporeal circulation. This does not only interfere with pathogen elimination from blood but also selectively augments the escape of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans from phagocytosis.",

Recent studies showed that while small wounds in fetal skin heal regeneratively, large wounds heal with fibrosis. We posit large wounds generate higher mechanical tension which alters HA metabolism in the fetal fibroblasts and lead to a pro-fibrotic phenotype.\n\nApproachC57BL/6J murine fetal (FFB; E14.5) and adult (AFB; 8wk) dermal fibroblasts were subjected to +/-10% tonic strain. Changes in PCM, HA enzymes and molecular weight, and fibrotic gene expression were measured.\n\nResultsFFB pericellular matrix reduced upon exposure to increased tension, and the HA profile shifted from high to lower molecular weight. Under static conditions, AFB had higher expression of HA synthases (HAS) 1 and 2 and degradation enzymes KIAA1199, HYAL1, and TMEM2 than FFB, suggesting more HA turnover in AFB. Tension resulted in an increase in HAS1, HAS3, KIAA1199, and HYAL2 expression and a decrease in HAS2 and TMEM2 expression in FFB. CD26, a marker associated with scar production, increased in FFB under tension, along with altered fibrotic gene expression profile and reorganized cytoskeletal f-actin and increased -SMA that resembled AFB.\n\nInnovationThis study elucidates the differences in how biomechanical tension alters HA metabolism and fibrotic phenotype of FFB vs AFB, providing further understanding of the fetal regenerative wound healing phenotype.\n\nConclusionUnderstanding the intrinsic differences in HA metabolism and fibrotic phenotype among FFB and AFB in response to wound mechanical stimuli may yield new insights to promote regenerative wound healing.",

While the highly abundant N6-methyladonsine (m6A) modification affects most aspects of mRNA function, the precise functions of the rarer 5-methylcytosine (m5C) remains largely unknown. Here, we map m5C in the human transcriptome using methylation-dependent individual-nucleotide resolution cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (miCLIP) combined with RNA bisulfite sequencing. We identify NSUN6 as a methyltransferase with strong substrate specificity towards mRNA. NSUN6 primarily targeted three prime untranslated regions (3UTR) at the consensus sequence motif CTCCA, located in loops of hairpin structures. Knockout and rescue experiments revealed that only mRNA methylation sites containing the consensus motif depended on the presence of NSUN6. Furthermore, ribosome profiling demonstrated that NSUN6-specific consensus motifs marked translation termination. However, even though NSUN6-methylated mRNAs were reduced in NSUN6 knockout cells, NSUN6 was dispensable for mouse embryonic development. Thus, our study identifies NSUN6 as methyltransferase targeting mRNA in a sequence- and structure-specific manner.",

Down-regulation of PLIN2 decreased specific OXPHOS proteins in all three models and reduced oxygen consumption rates in INS1 cells and mouse islets. Moreover, we found that PLIN2 deficient INS1 cells increased the distribution of a fluorescent oleic acid analog to mitochondria and showed signs of mitochondrial stress as indicated by susceptibility to fragmentation and alterations of acyl-carnitines and glucose metabolites.

    "abstract": "Several reports emphasized the importance of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) in hindering osteoblast differentiation and bone matrix mineralization. Its ubiquitous presence is thought to prevent \"soft\" tissue calcification, whereas its degradation to Pi in bones and teeth by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) may facilitate crystal growth. While the inhibiting role of PPi on osteoblast differentiation and function is largely understood, less is known about its effects on osteoclast determination and activity. In this study, we investigated the role of PPi in bone resorption using calverial organ cultures ex vivo. We present an evidence that PPi stimulated calvarial bone resorption marked by calcium (Ca2+) release in the condition media (CM). We then examined PPi effects on osteoclast differentiation using mouse bone marrow-derived monocytes (BMMs). Our results revealed that PPi enhanced osteoclast differentiation ex vivo, marked by increased number and size of TRAP-stained mature osteoclasts. Moreover, PPi stimulated osteoclastogenesis in BMMs co-cultured with osteoblasts. These data supported the increased osteoclast activity in bone resorption using functional osteo-assays. The finding of PU.1-Egr-1 dependent up-regulation of c-FMS and RANK receptors in BMMs supported the enhanced pre-osteoclast commitment and differentiation. Moreover, osteoclast survival was enhanced by activation of MITF-BCL-2 pathway that was mediated by MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling. Last, our data showed that PPi up-regulated ANK; PPi transporter, during osteoclast differentiation through ERK1/2 phosphorylation whereas mutation of ANK inhibited osteoclastogenesis. Collectively, our data suggest that PPi promotes osteoclast differentiation, survival, and function through PU.1 up-regulation and MITF phosphorylation whereas ANK loss-of-function inhibited osteoclastogenesis.",

However, the extent of its contribution to this expansion during primate evolution is unknown. Here we addressed this issue by genetic manipulation of ARHGAP11B levels and function in chimpanzee and human cerebral organoids. Interference with ARHGAP11Bs function in human cerebral organoids caused a massive decrease, down to a chimpanzee level, in the proliferation and abundance of basal progenitors, the progenitors thought to have a key role in neocortex expansion. Conversely, ARHGAP11B expression in chimpanzee cerebral organoids resulted in a doubling of cycling basal progenitors. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that ARHGAP11B is necessary and sufficient to maintain the elevated basal progenitor levels that characterize the fetal human neocortex, suggesting that this human-specific gene was a major contributor to neocortex expansion during human evolution.",

Because the Hi-C map with restriction fragment resolution is intrinsically associated with sparsity and stochastic noise, Hi-C data are usually binned at particular intervals; however, the binning method has limited reliability, especially at high resolution. Here, we describe a new method called HiCORE, which provides simple pipelines and algorithms to overcome the limitations of single-layered binning and predict core chromatin regions with 3D physical interactions. In this approach, multiple layers of binning with slightly shifted genome coverage are generated, and interacting bins at each layer are integrated to infer narrower regions of chromatin interactions. HiCORE predicts chromatin looping regions with higher resolution and contributes to the identification of the precise positions of potential genomic elements.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe Hi-C analysis has enabled to obtain information on 3D interaction of genomes.

We here developed HiCORE algorithm that generates multiple layers of bin-array and specifies core chromatin regions with 3D interactions. We validated our algorithm and provided advantages over conventional binning method.

    "abstract": "A direct way to spot structural features that are universally shared among proteins is to find proper analogues from simpler condensed matter systems. In most cases, sphere-packing arguments provide a straightforward route for structural comparison, as they successfully characterize a wide array of materials such as close packed crystals, dense liquids, and structural glasses. In the current study, the feasibility of creating ensembles of artificial structures that can automatically reproduce a large number of geometrical and topological descriptors of globular proteins is investigated. Towards this aim, a simple cubic (SC) arrangement is shown to provide the best background lattice after a careful analysis of the residue packing trends from 210 proteins. It is shown that a minimalistic set of ground rules imposed on this lattice is sufficient to generate structures that can mimic real proteins. In the proposed method, 210 such structures are generated by randomly removing residues (beads) from clusters that have a SC lattice arrangement until a predetermined residue concentration is achieved. All generated structures are checked for residue connectivity such that a path exists between any two residues. Two additional sets are prepared from the initial structures via random relaxation and a reverse Monte Carlo simulated annealing (RMC-SA) algorithm, which targets the average radial distribution function (RDF) of 210 globular proteins. The initial and relaxed structures are compared to real proteins via RDF, bond orientational order parameters, and several descriptors of network topology. Based on these features, results indicate that the structures generated with 40% occupancy via the proposed method closely resemble real residue networks. The broad correspondence established this way indicates a non-superficial link between the residue networks and the defect laden cubic crystalline order. The presented approach of identifying a minimalistic set of operations performed on a target lattice such that each resulting cluster possess structural characteristics largely indistinguishable from that of a coarse-grained globular protein opens up new venues in structural characterization, native state recognition, and rational design of proteins.",

    "abstract": "An opioid epidemic is spreading in North America with millions of opioid overdoses annually. Opioid drugs, like fentanyl, target the mu opioid receptor system and induce potentially lethal respiratory depression. The challenge in opioid research is to find a safe pain therapy with analgesic properties but no respiratory depression. Current discoveries are limited by lack of amenable animal models to screen candidate drugs. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is an emerging animal model with high reproduction and fast development, which shares remarkable similarity in their physiology and genome to mammals. However, it is unknown whether zebrafish possesses similar opioid system, respiratory and analgesic responses to opioids than mammals. In freely-behaving larval zebrafish, fentanyl depresses the rate of respiratory mandible movements and induces analgesia, effects reversed by mu-opioid receptor antagonists. Zebrafish presents evolutionary conserved mechanisms of action of opioid drugs, also found in mammals, and constitute amenable models for phenotype-based drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "{gamma}-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human brain. It has been shown that altered GABA concentration plays an important role in a variety of psychiatric and neurological disorders. The main purpose of this study was to propose a combination of PRESS and MEGA-PRESS acquisitions for absolute GABA quantification and to compare GABA estimations obtained using total choline (tCho), total creatine (tCr), and total N-acetyl aspartate (tNAA) as the internal concentration references with water referenced quantification. The second aim was to demonstrate the fitting approach of MEGA-PRESS spectra with QuasarX algorithm using a basis set of GABA, glutamate, glutamine, and NAA in vitro spectra. Thirteen volunteers were scanned with the MEGA-PRESS sequence at 3T. Interleaved water referencing was used for quantification, B0 drift correction and to update the carrier frequency of RF pulses in real time. Reference metabolite concentrations were acquired using a PRESS sequence with short TE (30 ms) and long TR (5000 ms). Absolute concentration were corrected for cerebrospinal fluid, gray and white matter water fractions and relaxation effects. Water referenced GABA estimations were significantly higher compared to the values obtained by metabolite references. We conclude that QuasarX algorithm together with the basis set of in vitro spectra improves reliability of GABA+ fitting. The proposed GABA quantification method with PRESS and MEGA-PRESS acquisitions enables the utilization of tCho, tCr, and tNAA as internal concentration references. The use of different concentration references have a good potential to improve the reliability of GABA estimation.",

    "abstract": "O-GlcNAc modification plays important roles in metabolic regulation of cellular status. Two homologs of O-GlcNAc transferase, SECRET AGENT (SEC) and SPINDLY (SPY), which have O-GlcNAc and O-fucosyl transferase activities, respectively, are essential in Arabidopsis but have largely unknown cellular targets. Here we show that AtACINUS is O-GlcNAcylated and O-fucosylated and mediates regulation of transcription, alternative splicing (AS), and developmental transitions. Knocking-out both AtACINUS and its distant paralog AtPININ causes severe growth defects including dwarfism, delayed seed germination and flowering, and abscisic acid (ABA) hypersensitivity. Transcriptomic and protein-DNA/RNA interaction analyses demonstrate that AtACINUS represses transcription of the flowering repressor FLC and mediates AS of ABH1 and HAB1, two negative regulators of ABA signaling. Proteomic analyses show AtACINUSs O-GlcNAcylation, O-fucosylation, and association with splicing factors, chromatin remodelers, and transcriptional regulators. Some AtACINUS/AtPININ-dependent AS events are altered in the sec and spy mutants, demonstrating a function of O-glycosylation in regulating alternative RNA splicing.",
