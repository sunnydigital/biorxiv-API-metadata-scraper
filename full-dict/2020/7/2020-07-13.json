    "abstract": "The major goal of this paper is to focus on the existing literature regarding the linkage between maritime, trade liberalization and industrial development in the context of CO2 by using econometrical model. In this context, it is attempted to reveal the effects of independent variables on CO2 (dependent variable) for China from 1980 to 2013 (annual data) by implementing Phillips-Perron (PP), Zivot-Andrews unit root tests, FMOLS, DOLS, CCR, ARDL and GMM methods. According to results of FMOLS, DOLS and CCR models there is a long-term stable relationship between sea transportation, trade liberalization, industrial development and carbon dioxide emissions which is proved empirically. Similarly, Short term ARDL estimation results reveal that the main determinants of CO2 in the short-run are changed in industrial development and maritime transport at 1% significance level. Table 6 summarizes the short-term ARDL results and the findings regarding the error correction model. According to Table 6, error correction model works in order to reach short-run adjustment. In the short term, approximately 78% of shocks in industrial development, maritime transport and trade liberalization are compensated within a period of time and the system is re-established in the long term. China produced half of the 1.2 million electric media used worldwide; the government directs its attention to the rehabilitation and reuse of all these lithium-ion batteries. Large-scale production of biofuels can still be several years away. Crude oil might be very difficult to promote alternative fuels on a national scale unless crude oil prices surge so high as to become unaffordable. Authorities underline: China will become the worlds number one economy. Now renewable energy will be more important, which should be encouraged to use by government on transportation so as to reduce the CO2 emissions. However, China can be leader excess oil use for transport if they want to dominate the economy worldwide.\n\nO_TBL View this table:\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1eb895corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@872f65org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@138912eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c3a12eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18b0cd8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_TBL O_FLOATNOTable 6.C_FLOATNO O_TABLECAPTIONShort Term ARDL Results and Error Correction Model of China.\n\nC_TABLECAPTION C_TBL",

    "abstract": "Anti-Trypanosoma brucei brucei and anti-Trypanosoma congolense activities of sera from two species of uninfected zoo-primates, Erythrocebus patas (red patas monkey) and Chlorocebus tantalus (tantalus monkey) were investigated. The sera were screened using thick films and haematocrit centrifugation technique (HCT), to ensure that the donor primates were not infected with trypanosomes. Trypanosoma brucei brucei (Federe strain) and Trypanosoma congolense were suspended in supplemented RPMI (Rossvelt Park Memorial Institute) 1640 medium and the motility of the parasite was used as index of viability after the addition of each test serum. The selected primate sera exhibited some degree of anti-Trypanosoma brucei brucei activities in vitro. Red patas monkey serum had an inhibition index of 0.27, while that of Tantalus monkey was 0.34, against Trypanosoma brucei brucei, with mean survival times of 22.00{+/-}1.73 hours for red patas monkey serum and 19.67{+/-}0.58 hours for tantalus monkey serum, which are significantly lower (P<0.05) than that of the control (30.00{+/-}0.00 hours). The selected primate sera had pronounced inhibitory activities against Trypanosoma congolense. Sera from the two species of primate had very high anti-Trypanosoma congolense activity showing an inhibition index of 0.91 for Red patas monkey serum and 0.90 for Tantalus monkey serum, with marked and significant reduction (P<0.05) in survival time of 7.00{+/-}1.73 hours in Red patas monkey serum and 7.67{+/-}0.58 hours in Tantalus monkey serum, compared with the control (74.00{+/-}1.00 hours). The in vitro anti-trypanosomal activity of the serum samples was shown to be cidal in nature. The activity was not associated with xanthine oxidase. This study revealed that sera from red patas monkey and tantalus monkey had a moderate anti-Trypanosoma brucei brucei activity and a very high anti-Trypanosoma congolense activity in vitro suggesting the presence of some non-specific materials.\n\nAuthors SummaryThe mechanisms that allow trypanosomiasis-resistant animals to control blood trypanosomes are being investigated, to identify non-specific factors that kill trypanosomes or limit their proliferation, contributing to host resistance. For instance, xanthine oxidase has been isolated and identified as the protein that kills trypanosomes in Cape buffalo. Humans and several other primates are also known to be resistant to infection by several animal-specific trypanosome species. In this study, sera from some zoo primates, red patas monkey and tantalus monkey, tested on Trypanosoma brucei brucei and Trypanosoma congolense in vitro, showed a slight anti-Trypanosoma brucei brucei activity and a very high anti-Trypanosoma congolense activity. These activities were shown to be cidal in nature and not associated with the protein xanthine oxidase. The authors suggest that non-specific factors other than the enzyme xanthine oxidase might have accounted for the sera anti-trypanosomal activities.",

    "abstract": "Asexual blood stages of the malaria parasite are readily amenable to genetic modification via homologous recombination, allowing functional studies of parasite genes that are not essential in this part of the life cycle. However, conventional reverse genetics cannot be applied for the functional analysis of genes that are essential during asexual blood-stage replication. Various strategies have been developed for conditional mutagenesis of Plasmodium, including recombinase-based gene deletion, regulatable promoters, and mRNA or protein destabilization systems. Among these, the dimerisable Cre (DiCre) recombinase system has emerged as a powerful approach for conditional gene targeting in P. falciparum. In this system, the bacteriophage Cre is expressed in the form of two separate, enzymatically inactive polypeptides, each fused to a different rapamycin-binding protein. Rapamycin-induced heterodimerization of the two components restores recombinase activity. We have implemented the DiCre system in the rodent malaria parasite P. berghei, and show that rapamycin-induced excision of floxed DNA sequences can be achieved with very high efficiency in both mammalian and mosquito parasite stages. This tool can be used to investigate the function of essential genes not only in asexual blood stages, but also in other parts of the malaria parasite life cycle.",

    "abstract": "A precisely balanced activity of canonical Wnt signaling is essential for a number of biological processes and its perturbation leads to developmental defects or diseases. Here, we demonstrate that alternative isoforms of the KDM2A and KDM2B lysine demethylases have the ability to negatively regulate canonical Wnt signaling. These KDM2A and KDM2B isoforms (KDM2A-SF and KDM2B-SF) lack the N-terminal demethylase domain, but they are able to bind to activated promoters in order to repress them. We have observed that KDM2A-SF and KDM2B-SF bind to and repress the promoters of AXIN2 and CYCLIN D1, two canonical Wnt signaling target genes. Moreover, KDM2A-SF and KDM2B-SF can repress a Wnt-responsive luciferase reporter. The transcriptional repression mediated by KDM2A-SF and KDM2B-SF, but also by KDM2A-LF, is dependent on their DNA binding domain, while the N-terminal demethylase domain is dispensable for this process. Surprisingly, KDM2B-LF is unable to repress both the endogenous promoters and the luciferase reporter. Finally, we show that both KDM2A-SF and KDM2B-SF are able to interact with TCF7L1, one of the transcriptional mediators of canonical Wnt signaling. KDM2A-SF and KDM2B-SF are thus likely to affect the transcription of the TCF7L1 target genes also through this interaction.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the locomotor activity and responses under stressful conditions to assess marijuana-induced abnormal behavior in zebrafish larvae (Danio rerio), as an alternative to the standard rodent model. To induce the desired symptoms, cannabidiol and WIN55,212-2, two chemical components derived from marijuana plants, were used. A repeated light and dark test was used to assess how drug exposure influenced locomotive responses. Subjects were examined after moderate cannabidiol and WIN55,212-2 exposure and 24 h after relocation into untreated water. Cannabidiol did not produce a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on locomotor activity; 0.5 and 10 g/mL cannabidiol decreased total distance and velocity, and 10 g/mL cannabidiol attenuated responses in the darkness. No differences between the control and cannabidiol-treated groups were apparent after 24 h in fresh water. WIN55,212-2 at 0.5 and 1 g/mL almost completely stopped fish activity even in darkness and at 10 g/mL induced mortality. Spending 24 h in fresh water almost reversed drug-induced immobilization, even in WIN55,212-2-treated groups. Subjects were evaluated for responses to additional cannabidiol after WIN55,212-2 exposure. Cannabidiol attenuated WIN55,212-2-induced abnormal immobilization, whereas commensurate doses of cannabidiol and WIN55,212-2 produced a mixed response. In conclusion, the behavioral effects of marijuana depend on the ratio of the two different cannabinoid properties. The repeated light and dark test might be a suitable method for drug-induced behavioral assay.",

    "abstract": "Conventionally, non-judicious and blanket fertilizer nitrogen (N) used in rainfed maize lead to higher N losses, low N use efficiency (NUEs) and poor yields due to substandard agronomic management practices. To avoid such N losses, fertilizer additions are synchronized with plant uptake requirements. In this context, agronomic based management focused on optimizing N rates and biochar application is essential for improved NUEs and crop productivity. Keeping this in view, a field experiment was conducted during 2014, 2015 and 2016 in rainfed maize (Zea mays L.) grown in Vertisols of India. In this study, twelve treatments that comprised of N omission plot (N0), skipping of basal rate, multi-split topdressing at varying time as broadcast and band placement, soil test crop response (STCR) based NPK with target yield 6.0 t ha-1 in maize and biochar application (10 t ha-1) were investigated. The experiment was conducted following a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) set up with three replications. Pooled analysis of three years data revealed that the application of N rates (120 kg Nha-1) in 2 equal splits (60 kg Nha-1) at knee high (V8) and tasseling (VT) stages with skipped basal N rate, achieved higher maize grain yield (5.29 t ha-1) ascribed to the greater growth parameters, yield components and N uptake compared to the recommended practices. Biochar application (10 t ha-1) as soil amendments along with multi top dressed N (120 kg N ha-1) into 3 splits also increased the grain yield. Delayed N application at V8 and VT growth stages, resulted in higher N uptake, agronomy efficiency (AE), partial factor productivity (PFP), physiology efficiency (PE) and recovery efficiency (RE). Biochar along with N fertilizer also improved the soil organic carbon (5.47g kg-1), ammonium-N (2.40 mg kg-1) and nitrate-N (0.52 mg kg-1) concentration in soil (P<0.05) as compared to non-biochar treatments. Application of biochar along with chemical fertilizer (120 kg Nha-1) significantly increased the concentration of ammonium (2.40 mg kg-1) and nitrate (0.52 mg kg-1) in soil (P<0.05) as compared to non-biochar treatments. The perfect positive linear relationship illustrated that the grain yield of rainfed maize was highly dependent (R2=0.99 at p<0.0001) on N availability, as indicated by the fitted regression line of maize grain yield on N uptake. On the other hand, factor analysis revealed, the one to one positive function relationship of biomass with N uptake at V8 and VT growth stages. Principal Component Regression (PCR) analysis showed that PC1 acted as a major predictor variable for total dry matter yield (TDMY) and dominated by LAI and N uptake. Consequently, these results expressed that the agronomic management based multi-top dressed N application and biochar application to achieve higher yield and greater NUEs in rainfed maize is strongly linked with N application into splits.",

Methods: Cylindrical samples of TM were produced and immersed in TRIS buffer and artificial saliva (AS) for selected time periods. This was followed by characterisation of the phases formed using 31P Magic Angle - Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Dentine discs treated with the material were analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to evaluate crystal shape and tubules occlusion. Results: SEM analysis showed the formation of plate-like crystals occluding the dentinal tubules. Solid-state characterisation analyses showed that TM cement samples immersed in TRIS-buffer (pH: 7.3) formed hydroxyapatite phases within approximately six hours of immersion. HA formation was less rapid for the samples stored in AS (pH: 6.5). Conclusions: This study shows that a TTCP-DCPA based desensitising product (TM) converts to HA in vitro and provides an effective option for the treatment of dentine hypersensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Computational modelling is an important research tool, helping predict the outcome of proposed treatment plans or to illuminate the mechanics of tumour growth. In silico modelling has been used in every aspect of cancer research from DNA damage and repair, tumour growth, drug/tumour interactions, and mutational status. Indeed, modelling even holds potential in understanding the interactions between individual proteins on a single cell basis. Here, we present a computational model of the cell cycle network of the cyclin family of proteins (cyclin A, B, D and E). This model has been quantised using western blot and flow cytometry data from a synchronised HUVEC line to enable the determination of the absolute number of cyclin protein molecules per cell. This quantification allows the model to have stringent controls over the thresholds between transitions. The results show that the peak values obtained for the four cyclins are similar with cyclin B having a peak values of 5x106 to 9x106 molecules per cell. Comparing this value with the number of actin proteins, 5E8, shows that despite their importance, the level of cyclin family proteins are approximately 2 orders of magnitude lower. The efficiency of the model presented would also allow for its use as an internal component in more complex models such as a tumour growth model, in which each individual cell would have its own cell cycle calculated independently from neighbouring cells. Additionally, the model can also be used to help understand the impact of novel therapeutic interventions on cell cycle progression.\n\nAuthor SummaryProtein and gene networks control every physiological behaviour of cells, with the cell cycle being controlled by the network of genes that promote the cyclin family of proteins. These networks hold the key to creating accurate and relevant biological models. Normally these models are presented with relative protein concentrations without any real world counterpart to their outputs. The model presented within shows and advancement of this approach by calculating the absolute concentration of each cyclin protein in one cell as it progresses through the cell cycle. This model employs Boolean variables to represent the genetic network, either the gene is active or not, and continuous variables to represent the concentrations of the proteins. This hybridised approach allows for rapid calculations of the protein concentrations and of the cell cycle progression allowing for a model that could be easily incorporated into larger tumour models, allowing for the tracking of discrete cells within the tumour.",

    "abstract": "In organ transplantation, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatch grafts not only induce the activation of cellular mediated immune response but also the development of chronic antibody-mediated rejection due to the donor-specific anti-HLA antibody (DSA) produced by B cells and plasma cells interacting with the graft endothelium.\n\nSignificant improvement in long-term survival after transplantation can be expected if antibody-mediated rejection due to the DSA can be overcome. However, the mechanism of producing or controlling the DSA remains to be elucidated.\n\nIn recent decades, \"humanized mouse model\" have been widely used for the basic research of human immune systems, but a humanized mouse model to analyze the mechanism of DSA production has not been established yet. Thus, we aimed to create a humanized mouse using a severe immunodeficiency mouse (NSG mouse) administered with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Initially, we detected very low level of human total-IgG and no anti-HLA antibodies (Abs) in these mice. The responder PBMCs with antibody-producing B cell activating factors added or regulatory T cells depleted were subsequently co-cultured with the irradiated stimulator PBMCs in vitro, and these whole cells were administered into naive NSG mice. The humanized model with sufficient human total-IgG and anti-HLA antibody production was consequently established. Interestingly, in all these mouse models, allo-specific anti-HLA Abs production was prominently suppressed, whereas non-allo-specific anti-HLA Abs were sufficiently detectable.\n\nTherefore, this novel humanized mouse model might be useful for analyzing the mechanism of anti-allogeneic human B cell tolerance induction.",

    "abstract": "Computational modeling in neuroscience has largely focused on simulating the electrical activity of neurons, while ignoring other components of brain tissue, such as glial cells and the extracellular space. As such, most existing models can not be used to address pathological conditions, such as spreading depression, which involves dramatic changes in ion concentrations, large extracellular potential gradients, and glial buffering processes. We here present the electrodiffusive neuron-extracellular-glia (edNEG) model, which we believe is the first model to combine multicompartmental neuron modeling with an electrodiffusive framework for intra- and extracellular ion concentration dynamics in a local piece of neuro-glial brain tissue. The edNEG model (i) keeps track of all intraneuronal, intraglial, and extracellular ion concentrations and electrical potentials, (ii) accounts for neuronal somatic action potentials, and dendritic calcium spikes, (iii) contains a neuronal and glial homeostatic machinery that gives physiologically realistic ion concentration dynamics, (iv) accounts for electrodiffusive transmembrane, intracellular, and extracellular ionic movements, and (v) accounts for glial and neuronal swelling caused by osmotic transmembrane pressure gradients. We demonstrate that the edNEG model performs realistically as a local and closed system, i.e., that it maintains a steady state for moderate neural activity, but experiences concentration-dependent effects, such as altered firing patterns and homeostatic breakdown, when the activity level becomes too intense. Furthermore, we study the role of glia in making the neuron more tolerable to hyperactive firing and in limiting neuronal swelling. Finally, we discuss how the edNEG model can be integrated with previous spatial continuum models of spreading depression to account for effects of neuronal morphology, action potential generation, and dendritic Ca2+ spikes which are currently not included in these models.\n\nAuthor summaryNeurons communicate by electrical signals mediated by the movement of ions across the cell membranes. The ionic flow changes the ion concentrations on both sides of the cell membranes, but most modelers of neurons assume ion concentrations to remain constant. Since the neuronal membrane contains structures called ion pumps and cotransporters that work to maintain close-to baseline ion concentrations, and the brain contains a cell type called astrocytes that contribute in keeping an appropriate ionic environment for neurons, the assumption is justifiable in many scenarios. However, for several pathological conditions, such as epilepsy and spreading depression, the ion concentrations may vary dramatically. To study these scenarios, we need models that account for changes in ion concentrations. In this paper, we present what we call the electrodiffusive neuron-extracellular-glia model (edNEG), which keeps track of all ions in a closed system containing a neuron, the extracellular space surrounding it, and an astrocytic \"domain\". The edNEG model ensures a complete and consistent relationship between ion concentrations and charge conservation. We envision that the model can be used to study a range of pathological conditions such as spreading depression and, hence, be of great value for the field of neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "Since the identification of SARS-CoV-2, a large number of genomes have been sequenced with unprecedented speed around the world. This marks a unique opportunity to analyze virus spreading and evolution in a worldwide context. Currently, there is not a useful haplotype description to help to track important and globally scattered mutations. Also, differences in the number of sequenced genomes between countries and/or months make it difficult to identify the emergence of haplotypes in regions where few genomes are sequenced but a large number of cases are reported. We propose an approach based on the normalization by COVID-19 cases of relative frequencies of mutations using all the available data to identify major haplotypes. Furthermore, we can use a similar normalization approach to tracking the temporal and geographic distribution of haplotypes in the world. Using 171 461 genomes, we identify five major haplotypes (OTUs) based on nine high-frequency mutations. OTU_3 characterized by mutations R203K and G204R is currently the most frequent haplotype circulating in four of the six continents analyzed. On the other hand, during almost all months analyzed, OTU_5 characterized by the mutation T85I in nsp2 is the most frequent in North America. Recently (since September), OTU_2 has been established as the most frequent in Europe. OTU_1, the ancestor haplotype is near to extinction showed by its low number of isolations since May. Also, we analyzed whether age, gender, or patient status is more related to a specific OTU. We did not find OTUs preference for any age group, gender, or patient status. Finally, we discuss structural and functional hypotheses in the most frequently identified mutations, none of those mutations show a clear effect on the transmissibility or pathogenicity.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionUntil the first two weeks of October 2019, 1.489,457 probable dengue cases have been reported in Brazil, with an incidence rate of 708.8 cases per 100 thousand inhabitants. Still in 2019, in the same period, 123.407 probable cases of chikungunya were reported, with 15 deaths confirmed by clinical and epidemiological criteria. Regarding Zika, in that period, 10.441 probable cases were recorded, been the northeast region with the highest number of notifications, followed by the midwest one. It is well known that current policies to control the vectors of those arboviruses are not effective. Studies for use of light-activated photosensitizers as an alternative to conventional insecticides for sustainable control of mosquitoes vector such as Aedes (dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, zika), Anopheles (malaria), Culex (yellow fever) can already be found showing advantages over conventional insecticides (efficacy, safety, non-mutagenicity and fast degradation).\n\nObjectiveTo evaluate the effectiveness of Photodynamic Therapy (PDT), mediated by curcumin and blue LED (460nm) in mortality of wild mosquitoes larvae of genus Aedes and also to verify, through confocal microscopy, how the photosensitizer internalizes in larvae organism. In addition to evaluating the action of PDT on the larvae with Raman spectroscopy and histological technique.\n\nMaterials and methodsOvitraps were placed in the city of Vitoria da Conquista, Bahia, and the larvae collected in stages L2 and L3 were fed for 24 hours with curcumin in concentrations of 10, 20 and 50% mixed with fish feed and then subjected to irradiation with blue LED for 2h (22mW / cm2 and 158.4 J / cm2). The larvae were placed in a container with dechlorinated water and mortality was monitored for 24 and 48 hours. Control groups in which only the larvae were exposed to blue LED for 2 hours and in which the larvae were only fed with fish feed mixed with curcumin (10, 20 and 50%) were included in the study, in addition to the group without treatment. All experiments were repeated after a 2-month interval to confirm the results, totaling 240 tests (tests 1 and 2, n = 15) between groups PDT 10%, PDT 20%, PDT 50%, curcumin 10%, curcumin 20%, curcumin 50%, blue LED and untreated group. The larvae belonging to the PDT 20% group, 20% curcumin, blue LED and control were submitted to histological slides, confocal microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Larvae mortality rates were compared between groups using univariate descriptive analysis.\n\nResultsAll PDT groups showed larvicidal activity, with the PDT group 20% showing the highest larval mortality in the shortest time. The images from confocal microscopy by laser scanning showed that curcumin was distributed throughout the digestive system of larvae and the analysis by Raman microspectroscopy have shown patterns of alteration and cell death, corroborated by histological sections.\n\nConclusionIt was concluded that PDT in all concentrations was effective in larval mortality, with PDT 20% having the best activity with mortality of 100% in 24 hours.",

    "abstract": "Beat gestures - spontaneously produced biphasic movements of the hand - are among the most frequently encountered co-speech gestures in human communication. They are closely temporally aligned to the prosodic characteristics of the speech signal, typically occurring on lexically stressed syllables. Despite their prevalence across speakers of the worlds languages, how beat gestures impact spoken word recognition is unclear. Can these simple  flicks of the hand influence speech perception? Across six experiments, we demonstrate that beat gestures influence the explicit and implicit perception of lexical stress (e.g., distinguishing OBject from obJECT), and in turn, can influence what vowels listeners hear. Thus, we provide converging evidence for a manual McGurk effect: even the simplest  flicks of the hands influence which speech sounds we hear.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTBeat gestures are very common in human face-to-face communication. Yet we know little about their behavioral consequences for spoken language comprehension. We demonstrate that beat gestures influence the explicit and implicit perception of lexical stress, and, in turn, can even shape what vowels we think we hear. This demonstration of a manual McGurk effect provides some of the first empirical support for a recent multimodal, situated psycholinguistic framework of human communication, while challenging current models of spoken word recognition that do not yet incorporate multimodal prosody. Moreover, it has the potential to enrich human-computer interaction and improve multimodal speech recognition systems.",

    "abstract": "Sound is caused by physical events in the world. Do humans infer these causes when recognizing sound sources? We tested whether the recognition of common environmental sounds depends on the inference of a basic physical variable - the source intensity (i.e., the power that produces a sound). A sources intensity can be inferred from the intensity it produces at the ear and its distance, which is normally conveyed by reverberation. Listeners could thus use intensity at the ear and reverberation to constrain recognition by inferring the underlying source intensity. Alternatively, listeners might separate these acoustic cues from their representation of a sounds identity in the interest of invariant recognition. We compared these two hypotheses by measuring recognition accuracy for sounds with typically low or high source intensity (e.g., pepper grinders vs. trucks) that were presented across a range of intensities at the ear or with reverberation cues to distance. The recognition of low-intensity sources (e.g., pepper grinders) was impaired by high presentation intensities or reverberation that conveyed distance, either of which imply high source intensity. Neither effect occurred for high-intensity sources. The results suggest that listeners implicitly use the intensity at the ear along with distance cues to infer a sources power and constrain its identity. The recognition of real-world sounds thus appears to depend upon the inference of their physical generative parameters, even generative parameters whose cues might otherwise be separated from the representation of a sounds identity.",

    "abstract": "Topoisomerases maintain topological homeostasis of bacterial chromosomes by catalysing changes in DNA linking number. The resolution of RNA entanglements occurring in the cell would also require catalytic action of topoisomerases. We describe RNA topoisomerase and hydrolysis activities in DNA topoisomerase I (topo I) from mycobacteria. The interaction of topo I with mRNA, tRNA and rRNA suggested its role in some aspect of RNA metabolism; the enzyme participates in rRNA maturation via its RNA hydrolysis activity. Accumulation of rRNA precursors in a topo I knockdown strain and the rescue of rRNA processing deficiency in RNaseE knockdown cells by topo I expression, indicated the enzymes back-up support to RNases involved in rRNA processing. We demonstrate that the active site tyrosine of the enzyme mediates catalytic reactions with both DNA/RNA substrates, and RNA topoisomerase activity can follow two reaction paths in contrast to its DNA topoisomerase activity. Mutation in the canonical proton relay pathway impacts DNA topoisomerase activity while retaining activity on RNA substrates. The mycobacterial topo I thus exemplifies the resourcefulness and parsimony of biological catalysis in harnessing the limited chemical repertoire at its disposal to find common solutions to mechanistically-related challenges of phosphodiester breakage/exchange reactions in DNA and RNA that are essential for cell survival.",

    "abstract": "Temperate phages are pervasive in bacterial genomes, existing as vertically-inherited islands called prophages. Prophages are vulnerable to the predation of their host bacterium by exogenous phages. Here we identify BstA, a novel family of prophage-encoded phage defense proteins found in diverse Gram-negative bacteria. BstA drives potent suppression of phage epidemics through abortive infection. During lytic replication, the bstA-encoding prophage is not itself inhibited by BstA due to a self-immunity mechanism conferred by the anti-BstA (aba) element, a short stretch of DNA within the bstA locus. Inhibition of phage replication by distinct BstA proteins from Salmonella, Klebsiella and Escherichia prophages is functionally interchangeable, but each possesses a cognate aba element. The specificity of the aba element ensures that immunity is exclusive to the replicating prophage, and cannot be exploited by heterologous BstA-encoding phages. BstA allows prophages to defend host cells against exogenous phage attack, without sacrificing their own lytic autonomy.",

We concentrated particles less than 0.2 m from grassland soil, enabling targeted metagenomic analysis of these organisms, which are almost totally unexplored in soil. We recovered a diversity of CPR bacteria and some nanoarchaea sequences, but no sequences from other cellular organisms. The sampled sequences include Doudnabacteria (SM2F11) and Pacearchaeota, organisms not previously reported in soil, as well as Saccharibacteria, Parcubacteria and Microgenomates. CPR and DPANN (an acronym of the names of the first included archaea phyla) enrichments of 100-1000-fold were achieved compared to bulk soil, in which we estimate these organisms comprise about 1 to 100 cells per gram of soil. Like most CPR and DPANN sequenced to date, we predict these microorganisms live symbiotic, anaerobic lifestyles. However, Saccharibacteria, Parcubacteria, and Doudnabacteria genomes sampled here also encode ubiquinol oxidase operons that may have been acquired from other bacteria, likely during adaptation to aerobic soil environments. We posit that although present at low abundance, CPR bacteria and DPANN archaea could impact overall soil microbial community function by modulating host organism abundances and activity.",

However, the most practicable current approaches rely on the generation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which can give rise to a poorly characterized spectrum of structural chromosomal abnormalities. Here, we show that a catastrophic mutational process called chromothripsis is a previously unappreciated consequence of CRISPR-Cas9-mediated DSBs. Chromothripsis is extensive chromosome rearrangement restricted to one or a few chromosomes that can cause human congenital disease and cancer (3-6). Using model cell systems and a genome editing protocol similar to ones in clinical trials (7) (NCT03655678, NCT03745287) we show that CRISPR-Cas9-mediated DNA breaks generate abnormal nuclear structures--micronuclei and chromosome bridges--that trigger chromothripsis. Chromothripsis is an on-target toxicity that may be minimized by cell manipulation protocols or screening but cannot be completely avoided in many genome editing applications.",

    "abstract": "The milk of lactating cows presents a complex ecosystem of interconnected microbial communities which can impose a significant influence on the pathophysiology of mastitis. Previously, we reported the alteration of microbiome (bacteria, archaea, virus) composition between clinical mastitis (CM) and healthy (H) milk. We hypothesized possible dynamic shifts of microbiome compositions with the progress of different pathological states of mastitis (CM, Recurrent CM; RCM, Subclinical Mastitis; SCM) determined by its favoring genomic potentials. To evaluate this hypothesis, we employed whole metagenome sequencing (WMS) in 20 milk samples (CM = 5, RCM = 6, SCM = 4, H = 5) to unravel the microbiome dynamics, interrelation, and relevant metabolic functions. PathoScope (PS) and MG-RAST (MR) analyses mapped the WMS data to 442 bacterial, 58 archaeal and 48 viral genomes with distinct variation in microbiome composition and abundances across these metagenomes (CM>H>RCM>SCM). PS analysis identified 385, 65, 80 and 144 bacterial strains in CM, RCM, SCM, and H milk, respectively, with an inclusion of 67.19% previously unreported opportunistic strains in mastitis metagenomes. Moreover, MR detected 56, 13, 9 and 46 archaeal, and 40, 24, 11 and 37 viral genera in CM, RCM, SCM and H-milk metagenomes, respectively. The CM-microbiomes had closest association with RCM-microbiomes followed by SCM, and H-microbiomes. Furthermore, we identified 333, 304, 183 and 50 virulence factors-associated genes (VFGs), and 48, 31, 11 and 6 antibiotic resistance genes (AGRs) in CM, RCM, SCM, and H-microbiomes, respectively, showing a significant correlation between the relative abundances of VFGs (p = 0.001), ARGs (p = 0.0001), and associated bacterial taxa. We also detected correlated variations in the presence and abundance of several metabolic functional genes related to bacterial colonization, proliferation, chemotaxis, motility and invasion, oxidative stress, virulence and pathogenicity, phage integration and excision, biofilm-formation, and quorum-sensing to be associated with different episodes of mastitis. Therefore, profiling the dynamics of microbiome in different states of mastitis, concurrent VFGs, ARGs, and genomic functional correlations will contribute to developing microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutics for bovine mastitis, and carries significant implications on curtailing the economic fallout from this disease.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent of Covid-19, has fired up a global pandemic. The virus interacts with the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for invasion via receptor binding domain (RBD) on its spike protein. To provide a deeper understanding of this interaction, we performed microsecond simulations of the RBD-ACE2 complex for SARS- CoV-2 and compared it with the closely related SARS-CoV discovered in 2003. We show residues in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 that were mutated from SARS-CoV, collectively help make RBD anchor much stronger to the N-terminal part of ACE2 than the corresponding residues on RBD of SARS-CoV. This would result in reduced dissociation rate of SARS-CoV-2 from human recep- tor protein compared to SARS-CoV. This phenomenon was consistently observed in simulations beyond 500 ns and was reproducible across different force fields. Altogether, our study shed light on the key residues and their dynamics at the virus spike and human receptor binding interface and advance our knowledge for the development of diagnostics and therapeutics to combat the pandemic efficiently.",

    "abstract": "Treatment of diseases that affect the CNS by gene therapy requires delivery of oligonucleotides to target cells within the brain. As the blood brain barrier prevents movement of large biomolecules, current approaches involve direct injection of the oligonucleotides, which is invasive and may have only a localised effect. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of 2 nm galactose-coated gold nanoparticles (NP-Gal) as a delivery system of oligonucleotides across brain endothelium.\n\nDNA oligonucleotides of different types were attached to NP-Gal by the place exchange reaction and were characterised by EMSA (electrophoretic mobility shift assay). Several nanoparticle formulations were created, with single-or double-stranded (20nt or 40nt) DNA oligonucleotides, or with different amounts of DNA attached to the carriers. These nanocarriers were applied to transwell cultures of human brain endothelium in vitro (hCMEC/D3 cell-line) or to a 3D-hydrogel model of the blood-brain barrier including astrocytes. Transfer rates were measured by quantitative electron microscopy for the nanoparticles and qPCR for DNA.\n\nDespite the increase in nanoparticle size caused by attachment of oligonucleotides to the NP-Gal carrier, the rates of endocytosis and transcytosis of nanoparticles were both considerably increased when they carried an oligonucleotide cargo. Carriers with 40nt dsDNA were most efficient, accumulating in vesicles, in the cytosol and beneath the basal membrane of the endothelium. The oligonucleotide cargo remained attached to the nanocarriers during transcytosis and the transport rate across the endothelial cells was increased at least 50fold compared with free DNA. The nanoparticles entered the extracellular matrix and were taken up by the astrocytes in biologically functional amounts.\n\nAttachment of DNA confers a strong negative charge to the nanoparticles which may explain the enhanced binding to the endothelium and transcytosis by both vesicular transport and the transmembrane/cytosol pathway. These gold nanoparticles have the potential to transport therapeutic amounts of nucleic acids into the CNS.",
