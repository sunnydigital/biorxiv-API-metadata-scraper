    "abstract": "The connexins form intercellular communication channels, known as gap junctions (GJs), that facilitate diverse physiological roles in vertebrate species, ranging from electrical coupling and long-range chemical signaling, to coordinating development and nutrient exchange. GJs formed by different connexins are expressed throughout the body and harbor unique channel properties that have not been fully defined mechanistically. Recent structural studies have implicated the amino-terminal (NT) domain as contributing to isoform-specific functional differences that exist between the lens connexins, Cx50 and Cx46. To better understand the structural and functional differences in the two closely related, yet functionally distinct GJs, we constructed models corresponding to CryoEM-based structures of the wildtype Cx50 and Cx46 GJs, NT domain swapped chimeras (Cx46-50NT and Cx50-46NT), and point variants at the 9th residue (Cx46-R9N and Cx50-N9R) for comparative MD simulation and electrophysiology studies. All of these constructs formed functional GJ channels, except Cx46-50NT, which correlated with increased dynamical behavior (instability) of the NT domain observed by MD simulation. Single channel conductance (\u03b3j) also correlated well with free-energy landscapes predicted by MD, where \u03b3j of Cx46-R9N was increased from Cx46 and the \u03b3js of Cx50-46NT and Cx50-N9R was decreased from Cx50, but to a surprisingly greater degree. Additionally, we observed significant effects on transjunctional voltage-dependent gating (Vj-gating) and open-state dwell times induced by the designed NT domain variants. Together, these studies indicate that the NT domains of Cx46 and Cx50 play an important role in defining channel properties related to open-state stability and single channel conductance.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.AbbreviationsGJgap junctionGjgap junctional coupling conductance\u03b3jsingle gap junction channel conductanceIjmacroscopic transjunctional currentijsingle gap junction channel currentCx46sheep connexin 46Cx50sheep connexin 50Vjtransjunctional voltageMDmolecular dynamicsr.m.s.d.root mean square deviationr.m.s.f.root mean square fluctuationPMFpotential of mean forceView Full Text",

    "abstract": "SummaryIn addition to the conserved translation elongation factors eEF1A and eEF2, fungi require a third essential elongation factor, eEF3. While eEF3 has been implicated in tRNA binding and release at the A and E sites, its exact mechanism of action is unclear. Here we show that eEF3 acts at the mRNA\u2013tRNA translocation step by promoting the dissociation of the tRNA from the E site, but independent of aminoacyl-tRNA recruitment to the A site. Depletion of eEF3 in vivo leads to a general slow-down in translation elongation due to accumulation of ribosomes with an occupied A site. Cryo-EM analysis of ex vivo eEF3-ribosome complexes shows that eEF3 facilitates late steps of translocation by favoring non-rotated ribosomal states as well as by opening the L1 stalk to release the E-site tRNA. Additionally, our analysis provides structural insights into novel translation elongation states, enabling presentation of a revised yeast translation elongation cycle.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Interactions between the sexes negatively impact health in many species, including mammals1\u20139. In mice, sexual interactions induce weight gain and shorten lifespan in females, independent of fertilization6,9. In Caenorhabditis, males shorten the lifespan of the opposite sex (females or hermaphrodites)1\u20133,8. However, the mechanisms underlying the negative influence of males on lifespan \u2013 and their overlap with known longevity pathways \u2013 are still largely unknown. Here, we use transcriptomic profiling and targeted screens to systematically uncover new conserved genes involved in male-induced demise. Interestingly, deficiency of these genes individually, and especially in combination, induces strong protection, highlighting the benefit of combining interventions to extend lifespan. Some genes (e.g. acbp-3, col-43) only extend hermaphrodite lifespan when knocked-down in the presence of males, suggesting specific protective mechanisms against male-induced demise. However, we also uncover two previously unknown longevity genes (sri-40 and delm-2) that, when knocked-down, extend hermaphrodite lifespan both with and without males, which points to new broad mechanisms of resistance. In sharp contrast, many classical long-lived mutants are actually short-lived in the presence of males, suggesting that males hijack and suppress known longevity pathways. This systematic analysis reveals striking differences in longevity in single sex versus mixed sex environments and uncovers the elaborate network of functional regulation elicited by sexual interactions, which could extend to other species.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Decellularized extracellular matrix (ECM) hydrogels present a novel, clinical intervention for a myriad of regenerative medicine applications. The source of ECM is typically the same tissue to which the treatment is applied; however, the need for tissue specific ECM sources has not been rigorously studied. We hypothesized that tissue specific ECM would improve regeneration through preferentially stimulating physiologically relevant processes (e.g. progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation). One of two decellularized hydrogels (tissue specific skeletal muscle or non mesoderm-derived lung) or saline were injected intramuscularly two days after notexin injection in mice (n=7 per time point) and muscle was harvested at days 5 and 14 for histological and gene expression analysis. Both injectable hydrogels were decellularized using the same detergent and were controlled for donor characteristics (i.e. species, age). At day 5, the skeletal muscle ECM hydrogel significantly increased the density of Pax7+ satellite cells in the muscle. Gene expression analysis at day 5 showed that skeletal muscle ECM hydrogels increased expression of genes implicated in muscle contractility. By day 14, skeletal muscle ECM hydrogels improved muscle regeneration over saline and lung ECM hydrogels as shown through a shift in fiber cross sectional area distribution towards larger fibers. This data indicates a potential role for muscle-specific regenerative capacity of decellularized, injectable muscle hydrogels. Further transcriptomic analysis of whole muscle mRNA indicates the mechanism of tissue specific ECM-mediated tissue repair may be immune and metabolism pathway-driven. Taken together, this suggests there is benefit in using tissue specific ECM for regenerative medicine applications.Competing Interest StatementKLC is co-founder, board member, consultant, receives income, and has equity interest in Ventrix, Inc.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Mammalian genomes are subdivided into large (50-2000 kb) regions of chromatin referred to as Topologically Associating Domains (TADs or sub-TADs). Chromatin within an individual TAD contacts itself more frequently than with regions in surrounding TADs thereby directing enhancer-promoter interactions. In many cases, the borders of TADs are defined by convergently orientated boundary elements associated with CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), which stabilises the cohesin complex on chromatin and prevents its translocation. This delimits chromatin loop extrusion which is thought to underlie the formation of TADs. However, not all CTCF-bound sites act as boundaries and, importantly, not all TADs are flanked by convergent CTCF sites. Here, we examined the CTCF binding sites within a [~]70 kb sub-TAD containing the duplicated mouse -like globin genes and their five enhancers (5-R1-R2-R3-Rm-R4-1-2-3). The 5 border of this sub-TAD is defined by a pair of CTCF sites. Surprisingly, we show that deletion of the CTCF binding sites within and downstream of the -globin locus leaves the sub-TAD largely intact. The predominant 3 border of the sub-TAD is defined by a steep reduction in contacts: this corresponds to the transcribed 2-globin gene rather than the CTCF sites at the 3-end of the sub-TAD. Of interest, the almost identical 1- and 2-globin genes interact differently with the enhancers, resulting in preferential expression of the proximal 1-globin gene which behaves as a partial boundary between the enhancers and the distal 2-globin gene. Together, these observations provide direct evidence that actively transcribed genes can behave as boundary elements.\n\nSignificance StatementMammalian genomes are complex, organised 3D structures, partitioned into Topologically Associating Domains (TADs): chromatin regions that preferentially self-interact. These chromatin interactions are thought to be driven by a mechanism that continuously extrudes chromatin loops, forming structures delimited by chromatin boundary elements and reflecting the activity of enhancers and promoters. Boundary elements bind architectural proteins such as CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF). Previously, an overlap between the functional roles of enhancers and promoters has been shown. However, whether there is overlap between enhancers/promoters and boundary elements is not known. Here, we show that actively transcribed genes can also behave as boundary elements, similar to CTCF boundaries. In both cases, multi-protein complexes bound to these regions may stall the process of chromatin loop extrusion.",

Treatment of APP/PS1 mice with complex I inhibitor after the onset of AD-like neuropathology improved energy homeostasis, synaptic activity, long-term potentiation, dendritic spine maturation, cognitive function and proteostasis, and reduced oxidative stress and inflammation in brain and periphery, ultimately blocking the ongoing neurodegeneration. Therapeutic efficacy in vivo was monitored using translational biomarkers FDG-PET, 31P NMR, and metabolomics.

    "abstract": "Human listeners achieve quick and effortless speech comprehension through computations of conditional probability using Bayes rule. However, the neural implementation of Bayesian perceptual inference remains unclear. Competitive-selection accounts (e.g. TRACE) propose that word recognition is achieved through direct inhibitory connections between units representing candidate words that share segments (e.g. hygiene and hijack share /haid{ezh}/). Manipulations that increase lexical uncertainty should increase neural responses associated with word recognition when words cannot be uniquely identified. In contrast, predictive-selection accounts (e.g. Predictive-Coding) proposes that spoken word recognition involves comparing heard and predicted speech sounds and using prediction error to update lexical representations. Increased lexical uncertainty in words like hygiene and hijack will increase prediction error and hence neural activity only at later time points when different segments are predicted. We collected MEG data from male and female listeners to test these two Bayesian mechanisms and used a competitor priming manipulation to change the prior probability of specific words. Lexical decision responses showed delayed recognition of target words (hygiene) following presentation of a neighbouring prime word (hijack) several minutes earlier. However, this effect was not observed with pseudoword primes (higent) or targets (hijure). Crucially, MEG responses in the STG showed greater neural responses for word-primed words after the point at which they were uniquely identified (after /haid{ezh}/ in hygiene) but not before while similar changes were again absent for pseudowords. These findings are consistent with accounts of spoken word recognition in which neural computations of prediction error play a central role.\n\nSignificance StatementEffective speech perception is critical to daily life and involves computations that combine speech signals with prior knowledge of spoken words; that is, Bayesian perceptual inference. This study specifies the neural mechanisms that support spoken word recognition by testing two distinct implementations of Bayes perceptual inference. Most established theories propose direct competition between lexical units such that inhibition of irrelevant candidates leads to selection of critical words. Our results instead support predictive-selection theories (e.g. Predictive-Coding): by comparing heard and predicted speech sounds, neural computations of prediction error can help listeners continuously update lexical probabilities, allowing for more rapid word identification.",

    "abstract": "In the two cell divisions of meiosis, diploid genomes are reduced into complementary haploid sets through the discrete, two-step removal of chromosome cohesion, a task carried out in most eukaryotes by protecting cohesion at the centromere until the second division. In eukaryotes without defined centromeres, however, alternative strategies have been innovated. The best-understood of these is that used by the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, where upon division of the chromosome into two segments or arms by the single off-center crossover, several chromosome-associated proteins or post-translational modifications become specifically partitioned to either the short or long arm, where they affect the timing of cohesion loss through as-yet unknown mechanisms. Here, we investigate the meiotic axis HORMA-domain protein HIM-3 and show that it becomes phosphorylated at its C-terminus, within the conserved \u201cclosure motif\u201d region bound by the related HORMA-domain proteins HTP-1 and HTP-2. Binding of HTP-2 is abrogated by phosphorylation of the closure motif in in vitro assays, strongly suggesting that in vivo phosphorylation of HIM-3 likely modulates the hierarchical structure of the chromosome axis. Phosphorylation of HIM-3 only occurs on synapsed chromosomes, and similarly to previously-described phosphorylated proteins of the synaptonemal complex, becomes restricted to the short arm after designation of crossover recombination sites. Regulation of HIM-3 phosphorylation status is required for timely disassembly of synaptonemal complex central elements from the long arm, and is also required for proper timing of HTP-1 and HTP-2 dissociation from the short arm. Phosphorylation of HIM-3 thus plays a role in establishing the identity of short and long arms, thereby contributing to the robustness of the two-step chromosome segregation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in genetics have increased our understanding of epistasis as important in the genetics of complex phenotypes. However, current analytical methods often cannot detect epistasis, given the multiple testing burden. To address this, we extended our previous method, Evolutionary Triangulation (ET), that uses differences among populations in both disease prevalence and allele frequencies to filter SNPs from association studies to generate novel interaction models. We show that two-locus ET identified several co-evolving gene pairs, where both genes associate with the same disease, and that the number of such pairs is significantly greater than expected by chance. Traits found by two-locus ET included those related to pigmentation and schizophrenia. We then applied two-locus ET to the analysis of preterm birth (PTB) genetics. Using ET to filter SNPs at loci identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we showed that ET derived PTB two-locus models are novel and were not seen when only the index SNPs were used to generate epistatic models. One gene pair, ADCY5 and KCNAB1 5\u2019, was identified as significantly interacting in a model of gestational age (p as low as 3 \u00d7 10\u22123). Notably, the same ET SNPs in these genes showed significant interactions in three of four cohorts analyzed. The robustness of this gene pair and others, demonstrated that the ET method can be used without prior biological hypotheses based on SNP function to select variants for epistasis testing that could not be identified otherwise. Two-locus ET clearly increased the ability to identify epistasis in complex traits.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTWR99210, a former antimalarial drug candidate now widely used for the selection of Plasmodium transfectants, selectively targets the parasite dihydrofolate reductase thymidine synthase bifunctional enzyme (DHFR-TS) but not human DHFR, which is not fused with TS. Accordingly, WR99210 and plasmids expressing human dhfr have become valued tools for the genetic modification of parasites in the laboratory. Concerns over the ineffectiveness of WR99210 from some sources encouraged us to investigate the biological and chemical differences of supplies from two different companies (compounds 1 and 2). Compound 1 proved effective at low nanomolar concentrations against Plasmodium falciparum parasites, whereas compound 2 was ineffective even at micromolar concentrations. Intact and fragmented mass spectra indicated identical molecular formulae of the unprotonated (free base) structures of 1 and 2; however, the compounds displayed differences by thin layer chromatography, reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, indicating important isomeric differences. Structural evaluations by 1H, 13C, and 15N nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy confirmed 1 as WR99210 and 2 as an isomeric dihydrotriazine. Induced fit, computational docking models showed that 1 binds tightly and specifically in the P. falciparum DHFR active site whereas 2 fits poorly to the active site in loose and varied orientations. Stocks and concentrates of WR99210 should be monitored for the presence of isomer 2, particularly when they are not supplied as the hydrochloride salt or are exposed to basic conditions that can promote isomerization. Absorption spectroscopy may serve for assays of the unrearranged and rearranged triazines.Competing Interest StatementOne author, Gavin Heffernan, is an employee of Jacobus Pharmaceutical Company, Inc.

    "abstract": "Colocalization analysis has emerged as a powerful tool to uncover the overlapping of causal variants responsible for both molecular and complex disease phenotypes. The findings from colocalization analysis yield insights into the molecular pathways of complex diseases. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth investigation of the promise and limitations of the available colocalization analysis approaches. Focusing on variant-level colocalization approaches, we first establish the connections between various existing methods. We proceed to discuss the impacts of various controllable analytical factors and uncontrollable practical factors on outcomes of colocalization analysis through realistic simulations and real data examples. We identify a single analytical factor, the specification of prior enrichment levels, which can lead to severe inflation of false-positive colocalization findings. Meanwhile, the combination of many other analytical and practical factors all lead to diminished power. Consequently, we recommend the following strategies for the best practice of colocalization analysis: i) estimating prior enrichment level from the observed data; and ii) separating fine-mapping and colocalization analysis. Our analysis of 4,091 complex traits and the multi-tissue eQTL data from the GTEx (version 8) suggests that colocalizations of molecular QTLs and GWAS traits are widespread in many complex traits. However, only a small proportion can be confidently identified from currently available data due to a lack of power. Our findings should serve as an important benchmark for the current and future integrative genetic association analysis applications.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Current protocols for producing cerebellar neurons from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are reliant on animal co-culture and mostly exist as monolayers, which have limited capability to recapitulate the complex arrangement of the brain. We developed a method to differentiate hPSCs into cerebellar organoids that display hallmarks of in vivo cerebellar development. Single-cell profiling followed by comparison to an atlas of the developing murine cerebellum revealed transcriptionally-discrete populations encompassing all major cerebellar cell types. Matrigel encapsulation altered organoid growth dynamics, resulting in differential regulation of cell cycle, migration and cell-death pathways. However, this was at the expense of reproducibility. Furthermore, we showed the contribution of basement membrane signalling to both cellular composition of the organoids and developmentally-relevant gene expression programmes. This model system has exciting implications for studying cerebellar development and disease most notably by providing xeno-free conditions, representing a more biologically relevant and therapeutically tractable culture setting.",
