    "abstract": "Extracting calcium traces from populations of neurons is a critical step in the study of the large-scale neural dynamics that govern behavior. Accurate activity extraction requires the correction of motion and movement-induced deformations as well as demixing of signals that may overlap spatially due to limitations in optical resolution. Traditionally, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) methods have been successful in demixing and denoising cellular calcium activity in relatively motionless or pre-registered videos. However, standard NMF methods fail in animals undergoing significant non-rigid motion; similarly, standard image registration methods based on template matching can fail when large changes in activity lead to mismatches with the image template. To address these issues simultaneously, we introduce a deformable non-negative matrix factorization (dNMF) framework that jointly optimizes registration with signal demixing. On simulated data and real semi-immobilized C. elegans microscopy videos, dNMF outperforms traditional demixing methods that account for motion and demixing separately. Finally, following the extraction of neural traces from multiple imaging experiments, we develop a quantile regression time-series normalization technique to account for varying neural signal intensity baselines across different animals or different imaging setups.

    "abstract": "Emotions selective effects on memory go beyond the simple enhancement of threatening or rewarding stimuli. They can also rescue otherwise forgettable memories that share overlapping features. Here, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the brain mechanisms that support this retrograde memory enhancement. In a two-phase incidental encoding paradigm, participants first view images of neutral tools and animals. During Phase 1, these images are intermixed with neutral scenes, which provides a unique  context tag for this specific phase of encoding. A few minutes later, during Phase 2, new pictures from one category are paired with a mild shock (fear-conditioned stimulus; CS+), while pictures from the other category are not shocked. fMRI analyses reveal that, across participants, retroactive memory benefits for Phase 1 CS+ items are associated with greater phasic reinstatement of the prior mental context during Phase 2 CS+ items. We also see that greater VTA/SN activation during Phase 2 CS+ items relates to this retroactive memory enhancement, suggesting that emotion promotes both the encoding and ongoing consolidation of overlapping representations. Additionally, we find that emotional experience-dependent changes in post-encoding hippocampal functional coupling with CS+ category-selective cortex relate to the magnitude of the retroactive memory effect. These hippocampal connectivity patterns also mediate the relationship between dopaminergic emotional encoding effects and across-participant variability in the retroactive memory benefit. Collectively, our findings suggest that an interplay between online and offline brain mechanisms may enable emotion to preserve seemingly mundane memories that become significant in the future.",

    "abstract": "In patients with focal drug-resistant epilepsy, electrical stimulation from intracranial electrodes is frequently used for the localization of seizure onset zones and related pathological networks. The ability of electrically stimulated tissue to generate beta and gamma range oscillations, called rapid-discharges, is a frequent indication of an epileptogenic zone. However, a limit of intracranial stimulation is the fixed physical location and number of implanted electrodes, leaving numerous clinically and functionally relevant brain regions unexplored. Here, we demonstrate an alternative technique relying exclusively on nonpenetrating surface electrodes, namely an orientation-tunable form of temporally-interfering (TI) electric fields to target the CA3 of the mouse hippocampus which focally evokes seizure-like events (SLEs) having the characteristic frequencies of rapid-discharges, but without the necessity of the implanted electrodes. The orientation of the topical electrodes with respect to the orientation of the hippocampus is demonstrated to strongly control the threshold for evoking SLEs. Additionally, we demonstrate the use of square waves as an alternative to sine waves for TI stimulation. An orientation-dependent analysis of classic implanted electrodes to evoke SLEs in the hippocampus is subsequently utilized to support the results of the minimally-invasive temporally-interfering fields. The principles of orientation-tunable TI stimulation seen here can be generally applicable in a wide range of other excitable tissues and brain regions, overcoming several limitations of fixed electrodes which penetrate tissue.",

Here, we present a complete description of the acquisition of multimodal MRI data along with the quality assurance (QA) and quality check (QC) procedures that we are following in this study.\n\nMethodsThe QA procedure consists of monitoring of different quantitative measurements using an agar gel and a geometrical phantom. For the already acquired data from human subjects, we describe QC steps for each imaging modality. To quantify reliability of outcome measurements, we perform test-retest reliability on human volunteers.\n\nResultsWe have presented results from analysis of phantom data and test-retest reliability on a human volunteer. Results show consistency in data acquisition and reliable quantification of different outcome measurements.\n\nConclusionThe acquisition protocol and QA-QC procedures described here can yield consistent and reliable outcome measures. We hope to acquire and eventually release high quality longitudinal neuroimaging dataset that will serve the scientific community and pave the way for interesting discoveries.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian sensory neocortex consists of hierarchically organized areas reciprocally connected via feedforward (FF) and feedback (FB) circuits. Several theories of hierarchical computation ascribe the bulk of the computational work of the cortex to looped FF-FB circuits between pairs of cortical areas. However, whether such corticocortical loops exist remains unclear. In higher mammals, individual FF-projection neurons send afferents almost exclusively to a single higher-level area. However, it is unclear whether FB-projection neurons show similar area specificity, and whether they influence FF-projection neurons directly or indirectly. Using viral-mediated monosynaptic circuit tracing in macaque primary visual cortex (V1), we show that V1 neurons sending FF projections to area V2 receive monosynaptic FB inputs from V2, but not other V1-projecting areas. We also find monosynaptic FB-to-FB neuron contacts as a second motif of FB connectivity. Our results support the existence of FF-FB loops in primate cortex, and suggest that FB can rapidly and selectively influence the activity of incoming FF signals.",

    "abstract": "Dominant-active mutations in Ras Homolog Enriched in Brain 1 (RHEB), such as the recently identified RHEBp.P37L mutation, can cause malformations of cortical development (MCD) with associated epilepsy and intellectual disability through a yet unknown mechanism. We found that focal expression of RHEBp.P37L in mouse somatosensory cortex results in an MCD-like phenotype, with increased mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, ectopic localization of neurons and generalized seizures. In addition, the RHEBp.P37L expressing neurons showed increased axonal length and branching. By temporally controlling RHEBp.P37L expression, we found that the cortical malformation by itself was neither necessary nor sufficient to generate seizures. Rather, seizures were contingent on persistent mTOR activation and enhanced axonal connectivity of RHEBp.P37L expressing neurons, causing hyperexcitability of distally connected neurons. These results provide new evidence of the extent of anatomical and physiological abnormalities caused by mTOR hyperactivity, beyond local malformations, that can lead to generalized epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "Advances in the development of three-dimensional (3D) brain organoids maintained in vitro have provided excellent opportunities to study brain development and neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimers disease (AD). However, there remains a need to generate AD organoids bearing patient-specific genomic backgrounds that can functionally recapitulate key features observed in the AD patients brain. To address this need, we successfully generated cerebral organoids from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) derived from a familial AD patient with a mutation in presenilin 2 (PSEN2). An isogenic control hPSC line was generated using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Both organoids were characterized by analysing their morphology, A{beta}42/A{beta}40 ratio and functional neuronal network activity. It was found that AD organoids had a higher A{beta}42/A{beta}40 ratio, asynchronous calcium transients and enhanced neuronal hyperactivity, successfully recapitulating some aspects of AD pathology. Therefore, our study presents a promising organoid-based biosystem for the study of the pathophysiology of AD and a platform for drug development for neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "Ultra high-field MRI enables sub-millimetre resolution imaging of the human brain, allowing for the resolution of functional circuits at the meso-scale of cortical layers. An essential step in many functional and structural neuroimaging studies is segmentation, the operation of partitioning the MR brain images to delineate anatomical structures. Despite recent efforts in brain imaging analysis, the literature lacks of accurate and fast methods for segmenting 7 Tesla (7T) brain MRI. We here present CEREBRUM-7T, an optimised end-to-end Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, that allows for the segmentation of a whole 7T T1w MRI brain volume at once, thus overcoming the drawbacks of partitioning the volume into 2D or 3D tiles. Training is performed in a weakly supervised fashion, exploiting labelling with errors obtained with automatic state-of-the-art methods. The trained model is able to produce accurate multi-structure segmentation masks on six different classes in only a few seconds. In the experimental part, a combination of objective numerical evaluations and subjective analysis carried out by experienced neuroimaging users, confirms that the proposed solution outperforms the training labels it was trained on in segmentation accuracy, and is suitable for neuroimaging studies, such as layer fMRI studies. Taking advantage of a fine-tuning operation on a reduced set of volumes, we also show how it is possible to efficiently and effectively apply CEREBRUM-7T to data from different sites. Furthermore, to allow replicability and encourage extensions, we release the code, 7T data (142 volumes), and other materials, including the training labels and the Turing test.",
