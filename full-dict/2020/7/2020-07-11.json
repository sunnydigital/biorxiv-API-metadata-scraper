    "abstract": "The default mode network (DMN) is thought to capture intrinsic activity of the brain and has been instrumental in understanding the dynamics of the brain. However, the DMN has not been without critics; both conceptual and empirical. The empirical criticisms caution against physiological noise as a source for the reported connectivity in the DMN. Smaller flip angles (FAs) have been modelled and shown to reduce physiological noise in BOLD signal recordings. A previous functional MRI (fMRI) study with flickering checkerboard stimuli, manipulated FAs to show that activity in the posterior-cingulate cortex (PCC) and precuneus is prone to physiological noise. This raises questions about studies that show activations in these areas (PCC and precuneus) with a fixed FA and the role of these areas in brain networks like DMN. Given the prominent role of PCC and precuneus in DMN, we studied the effect of FAs on the resting-state functional connectivity involving these areas in DMN. We used four FAs and recorded resting-state activity in a 3-T scanner. The results show PCC and precuneus BOLD functional connectivity is inconsistent. We lend support to previous empirical criticisms of DMN, linking its activity to physiological noise. Our results add to concerns about PCC and precuneus related BOLD activity and their putative role in DMN. Alongside previous studies we advocate using smaller flip angles as an empirical tool to investigate physiological noise in fMRI studies.",

    "abstract": "Stroke is a debilitating condition affecting millions of people worldwide. The development of improved rehabilitation therapies rests on finding biomarkers suitable for tracking functional damage and recovery. To achieve this goal, we perform a spatiotemporal analysis of cortical activity obtained by wide-field calcium images in mice before and after stroke. We compared spontaneous recovery with three different post-stroke rehabilitation paradigms, motor training alone, pharmacological contralesional inactivation and both combined. We identify three novel indicators that are able to track how movement-evoked global activation patterns are impaired by stroke and evolve during rehabilitation: the duration, the smoothness, and the angle of individual propagation events. Results show that, compared to pre-stroke conditions, propagation of cortical activity in the acute phase right after stroke is slowed down and more irregular. When comparing rehabilitation paradigms, we find that mice treated with both motor training and pharmacological intervention, the only group associated with generalized recovery, manifest new propagation patterns, that are even faster and smoother than before the stroke. In conclusion, our new spatiotemporal propagation indicators act as biomarkers that are able to uncover neural correlates not only of motor deficits caused by stroke but also of functional recovery during rehabilitation. These insights could pave the way towards more targeted post-stroke therapies.",

    "abstract": "Nogo-A is a well-characterized myelin-associated membrane protein that restricts fibre growth and the regenerative capacity of the adult central nervous system after injury. To date Nogo-A post-receptor signalling pathway research focused on the RhoA/ROCK cascade, which can lead to growth cone collapse and neurite retraction. Much less is known about continued intracellular Nogo-A signalling mediating long-term neurite outgrowth inhibition resulting from transcriptional and translational changes. Here, we propose a simple but highly reproducible in vitro assay to study Nogo-A related signaling and neurite outgrowth inhibition in general. Furthermore, we identified ERK1/2 as downstream effector of Nogo-A, partially mediating its neurite outgrowth inhibition. We describe ERK1/2 dependent changes of translational events such as elevation of RhoA levels within the growth cone, which may potentiate the cells responses to Nogo-A. We also observed Nogo-A dependent upregulation of the JAK/STAT pathway inhibitors SOCS3 and KLF4 and downregulation of insulin mediated phosphorylation of AKT, indicating direct negative crosstalk between Nogo-A signalling and the growth promoting JAK/STAT and AKT/mTORC1 pathways.",

    "abstract": "As our understanding of how motor output is generated increases, it is clear that there is a need to understand the interactions of multiple distinct regions rather than just the output properties of primary motor cortex. This becomes even more imperative when trying to understand how different regions may contribute to recovery following injury. In this study we used a technique that promotes functional motor recovery after injury, activity-dependent stimulation (ADS), to determine the short- and long-term effects on network activity and neuroplasticity of intracortical connections. ADS uses recorded neural activity to trigger stimulation of the brain and may be utilized to manipulate neuronal connectivity in vivo, representing a novel technique to shape intrinsic neuroplasticity. The aim of this work was to compare the effect of ADS to randomly-generated stimulation (RS) of the somatosensory area (S1) on the single units patterns of activity taking place in the premotor cortex (RFA) and to investigate whether synaptic plasticity changes occur in S1 as a consequence of 21 consecutive days of stimulation. In particular, we examined both firing rate changes and correlation between spiking activity and stimuli in chronically-implanted healthy ambulatory rats during both spontaneous and evoked activity, resulting from the two stimulation paradigms. Finally, we evaluated changes in expression of synaptophysin at the end of the treatment. This experimental procedure demonstrated the ability of ADS to modulate firing properties of RFA within daily recording sessions and to promote synaptogenesis in S1, further strengthening the idea that this Hebbian-inspired protocol can be used to effectively modulate cortical connectivity and thus suggesting its translational potential for promoting recovery after brain injury.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWA challenge in neuroscience is to describe the contribution of the brain anatomical wiring to the emergence of coordinated neural activity underlying complex behavior. Indeed, patterns of remote coactivations that adjust with the ongoing task-demand do not systematically match direct, static anatomical links. Here, we propose that observed coactivation patterns, known as Functional Connectivity (FC), can be explained by a linear diffusion dynamics defined on the brain architecture and driven by control regions. Our model, termed structure-informed FC, is based on a novel interpretation of functional connectivity according to which different sets of brain regions controlling the information flow on a fixed anatomical wiring enable the emergence of state-specific FC. This observation leads us to introduce a framework for the identification of potential control centers in the brain. We find that well-defined, sparse and robust sets of control regions, which partially overlap across several task conditions and resting-state, produce FC patterns comparable to empirical ones. In conclusion, this work introduces a principled method for identifying brain regions underlying the task-specific control of brain activity.\n\nSignificance statementUnderstanding how brain anatomy promotes particular patterns of coactivations among neural regions is a key challenge in neuroscience. This challenge can be addressed using network science and systems theory. Here, we propose that coactivations result from the diffusion of information through the network of anatomical links connecting brain regions, with certain regions controlling the dynamics. We translate this hypothesis into a model called structure-informed functional connectivity, and we introduce a framework for identifying control regions based on empirical data. We find that our model produces coactivation patterns comparable to empirical ones, and that distinct sets of control regions are associated with different functional states. These findings suggest that controllability is an important feature allowing the brain to reach different states.",

    "abstract": "The limited regenerative capacity of neuronal cells requires tight orchestration of cell death and survival regulation in the context of longevity, as well as age-associated and neurodegenerative diseases. Subordinate to genetic networks, epigenetic mechanisms, like DNA methylation and histone modifications, are involved in the regulation of neuronal functionality, and emerge as key contributors to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. DNA methylation, a dynamic and reversible process, is executed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). DNMT1 was previously shown to regulate neuronal survival in the aged brain, whereby a DNMT1-dependent modulation of processes relevant for protein degradation was proposed as underlying mechanism. Functional proteostasis networks are a mandatory prerequisite for the functionality and long-term survival of neurons. Malfunctioning proteostasis is found, inter alia, in neurodegenerative contexts. Here, we investigated whether DNMT1 affects critical aspects of the proteostasis network by a combination of expression studies, life cell imaging and biochemical analyses. We found that DNMT1 negatively impacts retrograde trafficking and autophagy, both being involved in the clearance of aggregation-prone proteins by the aggresome-autophagy pathway. In line with this, we found that the transport of GFP-labeled mutant HTT to perinuclear regions, proposed to by cytoprotective, also depends on DNMT1. Depletion of Dnmt1 accelerated HTT perinuclear HTT aggregation and improved the survival of cells transfected with mutant HTT. This suggests that mutant HTT-induced cytotoxicity is at least in part mediated by DNMT1-dependent modulation of degradative pathways.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental scientific question concerns the neuronal basis of perceptual consciousness, which encompasses the perceptual experience and reflexive monitoring associated with a sensory event. Although recent human studies identified individual neurons reflecting stimulus visibility, their functional role for perceptual consciousness remains unknown. Here, we provide neuronal and computational evidence indicating that perceptual and reflexive consciousness are governed by an all-or-none process involving accumulation of perceptual evidence. We recorded single-neuron activity in a participant with a microelectrode implant in the posterior parietal cortex, considered a substrate for evidence accumulation, while he detected vibrotactile stimuli around detection threshold and provided confidence estimates. We found that detected stimuli elicited firing rate patterns resembling evidence accumulation during decision-making, irrespective of response effectors. Similar neurons encoded the intensity of task-irrelevant stimuli, suggesting their role for consciousness per se, irrespective of report. We generalized these findings in healthy volunteers using electroencephalography and reproduced their behavioral and neural responses with a computational model. This model considered stimulus detection if accumulated evidence reached a bound, and confidence as the distance between maximal evidence and that bound. Applying this mechanism to our neuronal data, we were able to decode single-trial confidence ratings both for detected and undetected stimuli. Our results show that the specific gradual changes in neuronal dynamics during evidence accumulation govern perceptual consciousness and reflexive monitoring in humans.",

    "abstract": "Nonlinearity plays a fundamental role in the performance of both natural and synthetic biological networks. Key functional motifs in living microbial systems, such as the emergence of bistability or oscillations, rely on nonlinear molecular dynamics. Despite its core importance, the rational design of nonlinearity remains an unmet challenge. This is largely due to a lack of mathematical modelling that accounts for the mechanistic basics of nonlinearity. We introduce a model for gene regulatory circuits that explicitly simulates protein dimerization--a well-known source of nonlinear dynamics. Specifically, our approach focusses on modelling co-translational dimerization: the formation of protein dimers during--and not after--translation. This is in contrast to the prevailing assumption that dimer generation is only viable between freely diffusing monomers (i.e., post-translational dimerization). We provide a method for fine-tuning nonlinearity on demand by balancing the impact of co- versus post-translational dimerization. Furthermore, we suggest design rules, such as protein length or physical separation between genes, that may be used to adjust dimerization dynamics in-vivo. The design, build and test of genetic circuits with on-demand nonlinear dynamics will greatly improve the programmability of synthetic biological systems.",

    "abstract": "Allostery is a fundamental biophysical mechanism that underlies cellular sensing, signaling, and metabolism. Quantitative methods to characterize the genotype-phenotype relationships for allosteric proteins would provide data needed to improve engineering of biological systems, to uncover the role of allosteric mis-regulation in disease, and to develop allosterically targeted drugs1. Here we report the large-scale measurement of the genotype-phenotype landscape for an allosteric protein: the lac repressor from Escherichia coli, LacI. Using a method that combines long-read and short-read DNA sequencing, we quantitatively determine the dose-response curves for nearly 105 variants of the LacI sensor. With the resulting data, we train a deep neural network (DNN) capable of predicting the dose-response curves for additional LacI genotypes in silico. We then map the impact of amino acid substitutions on the allosteric function of LacI. Additionally, we demonstrate engineering of allosteric function with unprecedented accuracy by identifying LacI variants from the measured landscape with quantitatively specified dose-response curves. Finally, we discover sensors with previously unreported band-stop dose-response curves. Overall, our results provide the first high-coverage, quantitative view of genotype-phenotype relationships for an allosteric protein, revealing a surprising diversity of phenotypes and showing that each phenotype is accessible via multiple distinct genotypes.",

Here, we introduce an efficient, generalizable method (COMBINES-LID) for creating highly specific light-induced dimerization systems. Proof-of-principle was provided by creating nanobody-based, red light-induced dimerization (nanoReD) systems comprising a truncated bacterial phytochrome sensory module using a mammalian endogenous chromophore, biliverdin, and light-form specific nanobodies. Selected nanoReD systems were biochemically characterized and exhibited low dark activity and high induction specificity for in vivo activation of gene expression. Overall, COMBINES-LID opens new opportunities for creating genetically encoded actuators for the optical manipulation of biological processes.",
