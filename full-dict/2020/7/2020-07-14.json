    "abstract": "Enrofloxacin is an important antibiotic used for prevention and treatment of Salmonella infection in poultry in many countries. However, oral administration of enrofloxacin may lead to the alterations in the microbiota and metabolome in the chicks intestine, thereby reducing colonization resistance to the Salmonella infection. To study the effects of enrofloxacin on chicken cecal Salmonella, we used different concentrations of enrofloxacin to feed 1-day-old chickens, followed by oral challenge with Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium). We then explored the distribution patterns of S. Typhimurium in vivo in intestinal contents using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and microbial 16S amplicon sequencing on days 7, 14, and 21. Metabolome sequencing was used to explore the gut metabolome on day 14. Faecalibacterium and Anaerostipes, which are closely related to the chicken intestinal metabolome, were screened using a multi-omics technique. The abundance of S. Typhimurium was significantly higher in the enrofloxacin-treated group than in the untreated group, and S. Typhimurium persisted longer. Moreover, the cecal colony structures of the three groups exhibited different characteristics, with Lactobacillus reaching its highest abundance on day 21. Notably, S. Typhimurium infection is known to affect the fecal metabolome of chickens differently. Thus, our results suggested that enrofloxacin and Salmonella infections completely altered the intestinal metabolism of chickens.\n\nIMPORTANCEIn this study, we examined the effects of S. Typhimurium infection and enrofloxacin treatment on the microbial flora and metabolite synthesis in chicken guts in order to identify target metabolites that may cause S. Typhimurium colonization and severe inflammation and to evaluate the important flora that may be associated with these metabolites. Our findings may facilitate the use of antibiotics to prevent S. Typhimurium infection.",

    "abstract": "Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) benzalkonium (BZK) and cetrimide (CET) are common disinfectants used to inhibit or eradicate Gram-negative bacteria in clinical and agricultural products. QAC tolerance in Escherichia coli and other Enterobacterales species can confer cross-resistance to various clinically used antibiotics, making it important to understand mechanisms of QAC tolerance in greater depth. QAC adaptation by E. coli is hypothesized to alter MarRAB regulated genes that converge on the outer membrane, specifically, lipid A biosynthesis and transport genes, porins, and efflux pump systems. To test this, we performed a  multi-omics and phenotypic characterization of E. coli K-12 adapted to BZK and CET, to assess how QACs alter cell growth, genomics, and proteomics. E. coli adapted to either BZK and CET resulted in strains with stable QAC tolerance when either drug was omitted, elongated and narrower cell morphologies by scanning electron microscopy, and reduced growth fitness when compared to un-adapted E. coli. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that QAC adaptation increased E. coli tolerance by [&ge;]4-fold to BZK, CET, and other QACs but no antibiotic cross-resistance. Single nucleotide variants identified by whole genome sequencing and differentially accumulated proteins by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry identified alterations to various QAC-adapted E. coli genes and proteins belonging to: lipid A biosynthesis and transport (lpxLM, msbA, mla), the mar-sox-rob regulatory pathway (marR, rob), DNA/protein translation (gyrA, rpsA, rpoB, rapA). These alterations validate the hypothesis that mar-sox-rob network plays a role in QAC tolerance and identifies additional stress inducible genetic and protein QAC tolerant biomarkers.\n\nImportanceBacterial tolerance mechanisms associated with disinfectant QAC adaptation is hypothesized to overlap with the mar-sox-rob multiple antimicrobial resistance pathway but has not been directly shown. Here, we generate QAC tolerant E. coli strains and identify phenotypic changes associated with protein and genetic alterations caused by prolonged QAC exposure. We identified genes that overlap with known antibiotic resistance mechanisms as well as distinct genes and proteins specific to QAC adaptation that are useful for future bacterial disinfectant tolerance mechanism studies. However, these altered genes and proteins implicate MarR and Rob pathways specifically in QAC tolerance but, surprisingly, the involvement of mar-sox-rob pathways did not increase antibiotic cross-resistance. Many altered genes we identified were essential genes in lipid A biosynthesis/transport, DNA and RNA transcription, and protein regulation systems potentially explaining why only QAC cross-tolerance was observed and why we observed greater cell fitness costs despite MarR and Rob pathway involvement.",

    "abstract": "This paper tests the hypothesis that ungulate-UAV interaction depends strongly on flight altitude, that there may be a lowest altitude range for which the ungulates are not exceedingly disturbed, dictating a practically achievable level of discernibility in flight observation. This question strongly influences the future viability of the UAV in the study and protection of the ungulates in Africas arid savanna. This paper examined the behavioral responses of a group of free ranging ungulate species (Oryx, Kudu, Springbok, Giraffe, Eland, Hartebeest, and Impala) found in an animal reserve in Namibia to the presence of different in-flight UAV models. The study included 99 flights (337 passes) at altitudes ranging from 15 to 55 meters. The ungulates were unhabituated to the UAVs and the study was conducted in the presence of stress-inducing events that occur naturally in the environment. The results suggest strong correlations between flight altitude and response across the different ungulates and anecdotal evidence suggests in some cases rapid habituation to the UAVs.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical loading affects tendon healing and recovery. However, our understanding about how physical loading affects recovery of viscoelastic functions, collagen production and tissue organisation is limited. The objective of this study was to investigate how different magnitudes of loading affects biomechanical and collagen properties of healing Achilles tendons over time.\n\nAchilles tendon from female Sprague Dawley rats were cut transversely and divided into two groups; normal loading (control) and reduced loading by Botox (unloading). The rats were sacrificed at 1, 2- and 4-weeks post-injury and mechanical testing (creep test and load to failure), small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and histological analysis were performed.\n\nThe effect of unloading was primarily seen at the early time points, with inferior mechanical and collagen properties (SAXS), and reduced histological maturation of the tissue in unloaded compared to loaded tendons. However, by 4 weeks no differences remained. SAXS and histology revealed heterogeneous tissue maturation with more mature tissue at the peripheral region compared to the center of the callus. Thus, mechanical loading advances Achilles tendon biomechanical and collagen properties earlier compared to unloaded tendons, and the spatial variation in tissue maturation and collagen organization across the callus suggests important regional (mechano-) biological activities that require more investigation.",

    "abstract": "Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) orf13 (ac13) is a conserved gene in all sequenced alphabaculoviruses. However, its function in the viral life cycle remains unknown. In this study we found that ac13 was a late gene and that the encoded protein, bearing a putative nuclear localization signal motif in the DUF3627 domain, colocalized with the nuclear membrane. Deletion of ac13 did not affect viral DNA replication, gene transcription, nucleocapsid assembly or occlusion body (OB) formation, but reduced virion budding from infected cells by approximately 400-fold compared with the wild-type virus. Deletion of ac13 substantially impaired the egress of nucleocapsids from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, while the number of occlusion-derived viruses embedded within OBs was unaffected. Taken together, our results indicated that ac13 was required for efficient nuclear egress of nucleocapsids during virion budding, but was dispensable for OB formation.\n\nIMPORTANCEEgress of baculovirus nucleocapsids from the nucleus is an essential process for morphogenesis of mature budded viruses, which is required to spread infection within susceptible cells and tissues. Although many viral and host proteins are required for nucleocapsid egress, the specific mechanisms underlying this process in baculoviruses remain somewhat enigmatic. In the present study, we found that the ac13 gene, in addition to ac11, ac51, ac66, ac75, ac78, gp41, ac93, p48, exon0 and ac142, was required for efficient nuclear egress of nucleocapsids. Our results contribute to a better understanding of nucleocapsid egress in baculoviruses.",

    "abstract": "Due to rapid industrialization and global urbanization, heavy metal pollution of water reservoirs is a severe environmental threat. Moreover, the removal of these heavy metal ions of copper from the wastewaters using conventional methods are costly, time taking, and less effective. Whereas, biosorption proved as a better alternative technique over the traditional methods for the removal of metal ions from the water bodies. Biological materials or biosorbents have been used for the adsorption of metal ions from the aquatic system. Therefore, Rhizopus arrhizus (living biomass) for the biosorption of copper (Cu) metal was used as biosorbent in the present investigation. The pH and temperature at which biosorption occurs are critical. In case of R. arrhizus the maximum adsorption was recorded at pH 7.0, and a temperature of 35{degrees}C.Whereas, the maximum adsorption capacity (Q value) of 100 mg biomass of Rhizopus arrhizus was observed as 94.46 % at 80 ppm concentration. The maximum adsorption capacity of 200 mg biomass of test fungi was reported as 97.32 % at the metal concentration of 80 ppm. Maximum Q value (biosorption capacity, i.e. mg metal per g biosorbent) was 37.785 mg/g at an 80-ppm concentration in case of 100 mg biomass. In the case of 200 mg biomass, the maximum Q value was 19.464 mg/g observed at 80 ppm concentration. Overall, the present study showed that 100 mg and 200 mg Rhizopus arrhizus biomass acts as an excellent adsorbing material for the adsorption of Cu metal ions.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of the isoelectric point (pI) of viruses is beneficial for modeling virus behavior in environmental transport and physical/chemical treatment applications. However, the empirically measured pIs of many viruses have thus far defied simple explanation, let alone prediction, based on the ionizable amino acid composition of the virus capsid. Here, we suggest an approach for predicting virus pI by excluding capsid regions that stabilize the virus polynucleotide via electrostatic interactions. This method was applied first to viruses with known polynucleotide-binding regions (PBRs) and/or 3D structures. Then, PBRs were predicted in a group of 32 unique viral capsid proteome sequences via conserved structures and sequence motifs. Removing predicted PBRs resulted in a significantly better fit to empirical pI values. After modification, mean differences between theoretical and empirical pI values were reduced from 2.1 {+/-} 2.4 to 0.1 {+/-} 1.7 pH units.\n\nImportanceThis model is the first to fit predicted pIs to empirical values for a diverse set of viruses. The results suggest that many previously-reported discrepancies between theoretical and empirical virus pIs can be explained by coulombic neutralization of PBRs of the inner capsid. Given the diversity of virus capsid structures, this nonarbitrary, heuristic approach to predicting virus pI offers an effective alternative to a simplistic, one-size-fits-all charge model of the virion. The accurate, structure-based prediction of PBRs of the virus capsid employed here may also be of general interest to structural virologists.",

Its reduced levels in diet-induced obesity (DIO) contributes to hyperleptinemia and leptin resistance, effects that are known to be regulated by the endocannabinoid (eCB)/CB1R system. Here we show that pharmacological activation/blockade as well as genetic overexpression/deletion of hepatic CB1R modulates sOb-R levels and consequently hepatic leptin resistance. Interestingly, peripheral CB1R blockade failed to reverse DIO-induced reduction of sOb-R levels, fat mass, dyslipidemia, and hepatic steatosis in mice lacking C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), whereas direct activation of CB1R in hepatocytes reduced sOb-R levels in a CHOP-dependent manner. Moreover, CHOP stimulation increased sOb-R expression and release via a direct regulation of its promoter, while CHOP deletion reduced leptin sensitivity. Our findings highlight a novel molecular aspect by which the hepatic eCB/CB1R system involves in the development of hepatic leptin resistance by regulating sOb-R levels via CHOP.\n\nSummaryHere we describe a novel molecular aspect by which the hepatic endocannabinoid/CB1R system contributes to hepatic leptin resistance by regulating soluble leptin receptor levels via CHOP.",

    "abstract": "The hormone ghrelin and its receptor, the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) are expressed in myocardium. GHSR binding activates signalling pathways coupled to cardiomyocyte survival and contractility. These properties have made the ghrelin-GHSR axis a candidate for a biomarker of cardiac function. The dynamics of ghrelin-GHSR are altered significantly in late stages of heart failure and cardiomyopathy, when left ventricular (LV) function is failing. We examined the relationship of GHSR with ghrelin in cardiac tissue from patients with valvular disease with no detectable changes in LV function. Biopsy samples from the LV and left atrium (LA) were obtained from 25 patients with valvular disease (of whom 13 also had coronary artery disease) and preserved LV ejection fraction, and compared control samples obtained via autopsy. Using quantitative confocal fluorescence microscopy, levels of GHSR were determined using a fluorescent peptide analog of ghrelin, Cy5-ghrelin(1-19); ghrelin, the heart failure marker natriuretic peptide type-b (BNP), and contractility marker sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase pump (SERCA2a) were measured by immunofluorescence. A positive correlation between GHSR and ghrelin was apparent in only diseased tissue. Ghrelin and BNP significantly correlated in the LV and strongly co-localized to the same intracellular compartment in both diseased and control tissue. GHSR, ghrelin and BNP all strongly and significantly correlated with SERCA2a in the LV of diseased tissue only. Our results suggest that the dynamics of the myocardial ghrelin/GHSR axis is altered in cardiovascular disease in the absence of measurable changes in heart function, and may accompany a regional shift in endocrine programming.",

    "abstract": "Abstract/SummaryProtein synthesis rate and accuracy are essential for bona fide protein synthesis and proteome homeostasis (proteostasis), however the mRNA translation elongation factors that prevent protein mistranslation, misfolding and aggregation are poorly understood. To address this question, we evaluated the role of 70 yeast tRNA modifying enzyme genes on protein aggregation and used mass spectrometry to identify the aggregated and mistranslated proteins. We show that the mitochondrial tRNA-modifying enzyme Slm3 thiolates the cytoplasmic tRNAs at position 34 and that decreased levels of mcm5s2U34 in SLM3 mutants are compensated by increasing mcm5U34, ncm5U34 and ncm5Um34 levels. In the tRNA gene knockout strains, stress response proteins are overrepresented in protein aggregates and their genes are enriched in codons decoded by tRNAs lacking mcm5U34, mcm5s2U34, ncm5U34, ncm5Um34, modifications. Increased rates of amino acid misincorporation were detected in the yeast ELP1, SLM3 and TRM9 gene knockout mutants at protein sites that specifically mapped to the codons sites that are decoded by the hypomodified tRNAs, demonstrating that U34 tRNA modifications safeguard the proteome from translational errors, misfolding and cellular proteotoxic stress.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDCommercially-made low-cost electroencephalography (EEG) devices have become increasingly available over the last decade. One of these devices, Emotiv EPOC, is currently used in a wide variety of settings, including brain-computer interface (BCI) and cognitive neuroscience research.\n\nPURPOSEThe aim of this study was to chart peer-reviewed reports of Emotiv EPOC projects to provide an informed summary on the use of this device for scientific purposes.\n\nMETHODSWe followed a five-stage methodological framework for a scoping review that included a systematic search using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. We searched the following electronic databases: PsychINFO, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore. We charted study data according to application (BCI, clinical, signal processing, experimental research, and validation) and location of use (as indexed by the first authors address).\n\nRESULTSWe identified 382 relevant studies. The top five publishing countries were the United States (n = 35), India (n = 25), China (n = 20), Poland (n = 17), and Pakistan (n = 17). The top five publishing cities were Islamabad (n = 11), Singapore (n = 10), Cairo, Sydney, and Bandung (n = 7 each). Most of these studies used Emotiv EPOC for BCI purposes (n = 277), followed by experimental research (n = 51). Thirty-one studies were aimed at validating EPOC as an EEG device and a handful of studies used EPOC for improving EEG signal processing (n = 12) or for clinical purposes (n = 11).\n\nCONCLUSIONSIn its first 10 years, Emotiv EPOC has been used around the world in diverse applications, from control of robotic limbs and wheelchairs to user authentication in security systems to identification of emotional states. Given the widespread use and breadth of applications, it is clear that researchers are embracing this technology.",

    "abstract": "To distinguish between somatic stimuli, the primary somatosensory cortex should process dissimilar stimuli with distinct patterns of neuronal activation. Two-photon calcium imaging permits simultaneous optical recording of sensory evoked activity in hundreds of cortical neurons during varied sensory stimulation. Hence, it allows a visualization of patterns of activity in individual neurons and local cortical networks in response to distinct stimulation. Here, flavoprotein autofluorescence imaging was used to map the somatosensory cortex of anaesthetized C57BL/6 mice, and in vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging was used to define patterns of neuronal activation during mechanical stimulation of the contralateral forelimb or hindlimb at various frequencies (3, 10, 100, 200, and 300 Hz). The data revealed that neurons within the limb associated somatosensory cortex exhibit stimulus-specific patterns of activity. Subsets of neurons were found to have sensory-evoked activity that is either primarily responsive to single stimulus frequencies or broadly responsive to multiple frequencies of limb movement. High frequency stimuli were shown to elicit more activation across the population, with a greater percentage of the population responding and greater percentage of cells with high amplitude responses. Stimulus-evoked cell-cell correlations within these neuronal networks varied as a function of frequency of stimulation, such that each stimulus elicited a distinct pattern that was more consistent across multiple trials of the same stimulus compared to trials at different frequencies of stimulation. The variation in cortical response to these artificial stimuli can thus be represented by the population pattern of supra-threshold Ca2+ transients, the magnitude and temporal properties of the evoked activity, and the structure of the stimulus-evoked correlation between responsive neurons.",

    "abstract": "To a crucial extent, the efficiency of reading results from the fact that visual word recognition is faster in predictive contexts. Predictive coding models suggest that this facilitation results from pre-activation of predictable stimulus features across multiple representational levels before stimulus onset. Still, it is not sufficiently understood which aspects of the rich set of linguistic representations that are activated during reading - visual, orthographic, phonological, and/or lexical-semantic - contribute to context-dependent facilitation. To investigate in detail which linguistic representations are pre-activated in a predictive context and how they affect subsequent stimulus processing, we combined a well-controlled repetition priming paradigm, including words and pseudowords (i.e., pronounceable nonwords), with behavioral and magnetoencephalography measurements. For statistical analysis, we used linear mixed modeling, which we found had a higher statistical power compared to conventional multivariate pattern decoding analysis. Behavioral data from 49 participants indicate that word predictability (i.e., context present vs. absent) facilitated orthographic and lexical-semantic, but not visual or phonological processes. Magnetoencephalography data from 38 participants show sustained activation of orthographic and lexical-semantic representations in the interval before processing the predicted stimulus, suggesting selective pre-activation at multiple levels of linguistic representation as proposed by predictive coding. However, we found more robust lexical-semantic representations when processing predictable in contrast to unpredictable letter strings, and pre-activation effects mainly resembled brain responses elicited when processing the expected letter string. This finding suggests that pre-activation did not result in  explaining away predictable stimulus features, but rather in a  sharpening of brain responses involved in word processing.",

    "abstract": "Currently, several human brain functional atlases are used to define the spatial constituents of the resting-state networks (RSNs). However, the only brain atlases available are derived from samples of young adults. As brain networks are continuously reconfigured throughout life, the lack of brain atlases derived from older populations may influence RSN results in late adulthood. To address this gap, the aim of the study was to construct a reliable brain atlas derived only from older participants. We leveraged resting-state functional MRI data from three cohorts of healthy older adults (total N=563; age=55-95years) and a younger-adult cohort (N=128; age=18-35 years). We identified the major RSNs and their subdivisions across all older-adult cohorts. We demonstrated high spatial reproducibility of these RSNs with an average spatial overlap of 67%. Importantly, the RSNs derived from the older-adult cohorts were spatially different from those derived from the younger-adult cohort (p=2.3x10-3). Lastly, we constructed a novel brain atlas, called Atlas55+, which includes the consensus of the major RSNs and their subdivisions across the older-adult cohorts. Thus, Atlas55+ provides a reliable age-appropriate template for RSNs in late adulthood and is publicly available. Our results confirm the need for age-appropriate functional atlases for studies investigating aging-related brain mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Achieving optimal behavior requires animals to flexibly retrieve prior knowledge. Here we show that adult newborn granule cells (anbGCs) mediate emotional-state-dependent plasticity of memory retrieval. We find that acute social reward (aSR) enhances memory retrieval by increasing the reactivation of engram cells, while acute social stress (aSS) weakens retrieval and reduces the reactivation. Such bidirectional regulation relies on the activation of distinct populations of anbGCs by aSR and aSS, triggering opposing modifications of dDG activity, which is sufficient to regulate and predict the performance of memory retrieval. Concordantly, in emotional disorder models, aSR-dependent memory plasticity is impaired, while the effect of aSS remains intact. Together, our data revealed that anbGCs mediate plasticity of memory retrieval, allowing animals to flexibly retrieve memory according to the current emotional state, and suggested the essential roles of anbGCs in translating emotional information to the regulation of memory expression.",

Using cell-specific manipulations of inhibitory neuronal activity, we discovered a key role of the dentate gyrus (DG) in coordinating dispersed neuronal populations during memory formation. In whole-brain fMRI and electrophysiological experiments, we found that parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in the DG control the functional coupling of the hippocampus within a wider network of neocortical and subcortical structures including the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc). In a novel object-location task, regulation of PV interneuron activity enhanced or prevented memory encoding and, without effect upon the total number of task activated c-Fos+ cells, revealed a correlation between activated neuronal populations in the hippocampus-PFC-NAc network. These data suggest a critical regulatory role of PV interneurons in the dentate gyrus in brain-wide polysynaptic communication channels and the association of cell assemblies across multiple brain regions.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the similarity of cortico-subcortical networks topologies between humans and nonhuman primate species is critical to study the origin of network alternations underlying human neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases. The New World common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has become popular as a non-human primate model for human brain function. Most marmoset connectomic research, however, has exclusively focused on cortical areas, with connectivity to subcortical networks less extensively explored. In this study, we aimed to first isolate patterns of subcortical connectivity with cortical resting-state networks (RSNs) in awake marmosets using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI), then to compare these networks to those in humans using connectivity fingerprinting. While we could match several marmoset and human RSNs based on their functional fingerprints, we also found a few striking differences, for example strong functional connectivity of the default mode network with the superior colliculus in marmosets that was much weaker in humans. Together, these findings demonstrate that many of the core cortico-subcortical networks in humans are also present in marmosets, but that small, potentially functionally relevant differences exist.",

    "abstract": "Writing systems are a recent cultural invention, which makes it unlikely that specific cognitive mechanisms have developed through selective pressure for reading itself. Instead, reading might capitalize on evolutionary older mechanisms that originally supported other tasks. Accordingly, animals such as baboons can be trained to perform visual word recognition. This suggests that the visual mechanisms supporting reading might be phylogenetically old and domain-general. Here we propose that if the human reading system relies on domain-general visual mechanisms, effects that are typically found within the domain of reading should also be observable with non-orthographic visual stimuli. To test this hypothesis, we systematically tested different types of visual material with the same experimental design. Subjects were passively familiarized with a set of composite visual items, and then tested in an oddball paradigm for their ability to detect novel stimuli. Some of these novel stimuli shared their statistical structure with the familiar items, and were found to be hard to detect in two experiments using strings of letter-like symbols; this replicates the well-known, and supposedly reading-specific, bigram effect. Crucially, in two further experiments we show that the same effect emerges with made-up, 3D objects and sinusoidal gratings. The effect size was equivalent across experiments, despite the use of radically different stimuli. These data suggest that a fundamental mechanism behind visual word learning also supports the learning of other visual stimuli, implying that such mechanism is general-purpose. This mechanism would enable the statistical learning of regularities in the visual environment.",

Recent advances in neural recording techniques have made it possible to monitor the activities of a large number of neurons across different brain regions as animals perform behavioural tasks. This poses the critical challenge of establishing links between neural activity at a microscopic scale, which might for instance represent sensory input, and at a macroscopic scale, which then generates behaviour. Predominant modeling methods apply rather disjoint techniques to these scales; by contrast, we suggest an end-to-end model which exploits recent developments of flexible, but tractable, neural network point-process models to characterize dependencies between stimuli, actions, and neural data. We apply this model to a public dataset collected using Neuropixel probes in mice performing a visually-guided behavioural task as well as a synthetic dataset produced from a hierarchical network model with reciprocally connected sensory and integration circuits intended to characterize animal behaviour in a fixed-duration motion discrimination task. We show that our model outperforms previous approaches and contributes novel insights into the relationships between neural activities and behaviour.",

Using knockout mice and pharmacological inhibitors, we identified transient receptor canonical 5 (TRPC5) as a key contributor to the persistent tactile pain that occurs in many inflammatory and neuropathic preclinical rodent models. TRPC5 inhibition was effective in injuries associated with elevated levels of the bioactive phospholipid lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). Exogenous application of LPC induced TRPC5-dependent behavioral mechanical allodynia, neuronal mechanical hypersensitivity, and spontaneous pain. In vitro, LPC activated both homomeric mouse and human TRPC5 channels, which upon examination of human dorsal root ganglia tissue, were expressed in 75% of human sensory neurons. Based on these results, TRPC5 inhibitors should be pursued as personalized therapy for spontaneous and tactile pain in conditions where elevated LPC is a biomarker.",

    "abstract": "Near-threshold perception is a paradigm case of perceptual reports diverging from reality - perception of an unchanging stimulus can vacillate from undetected to clearly perceived. Among the many factors that predict whether a stimulus will reach awareness, the amplitude of low-frequency brain oscillations - particularly in the alpha frequency band (8-13 Hz) - has emerged as a reliable predictor of trial-to-trial variability in perceptual decisions. Analysis grounded in signal detection theory suggest that strong prestimulus alpha oscillations diminish subjective perception without affecting the accuracy or sensitivity (d) of perceptual decisions. These results, coupled with recent studies on sensory responses, point to an inhibitory influence of alpha-band amplitude on early visuocortical activity. The findings to date have been based on simple, low-level visual stimuli, which warrant a focus on early visual processing. However, the physiology of alpha in higher-level visual areas is known to be distinct from early visual cortex, with evidence indicating that alpha amplitude in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex is excitatory (rather than inhibitory, as in early visual cortex). Here, we addressed the question of how spontaneous oscillatory amplitude impacts subjective and objective aspects of perception using a high-level perceptual decision task. Human observers completed a near-threshold face/house discrimination task with subjective visibility ratings while electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded. Using a single-trial multiple regression analysis, we found that spontaneous fluctuations in pre-stimulus alpha-band amplitude were negatively related to visibility ratings but did not predict trial-by-trial accuracy. These results suggest that the inhibitory influence of prestimulus alpha activity in early visual cortex, rather than the excitatory influence of alpha in IT, comes to bias high-level perceptual reports. Our findings provide further evidence that ongoing alpha amplitude dissociates subjective and objective measures of visual perception.",

    "abstract": "The organization of sensory maps in the cerebral cortex depends on experience, which drives homeostatic and long-term synaptic plasticity of cortico-cortical circuits. In the mouse primary somatosensory cortex (S1) afferents from the higher-order, posterior medial thalamic nucleus (POm) gate synaptic plasticity in layer (L) 2/3 pyramidal neurons via disinhibition and the production of dendritic plateau potentials. Here we address whether these thalamocortically mediated responses play a role in whisker map plasticity in S1. We find that trimming all but two whiskers causes a partial fusion of the representations of the two spared whiskers, concomitantly with an increase in the occurrence of POm-driven, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent plateau potentials. Blocking the plateau potentials restores the archetypical organization of the sensory map. Our results reveal a novel mechanism for experience-dependent cortical map plasticity in which higher-order thalamocortically mediated plateau potentials facilitate the fusion of normally segregated cortical representations.",

    "abstract": "Acute stress is ubiquitous in everyday life, but the extent to which acute stress affects how people learn from the outcomes of their choices is still poorly understood. Here, we investigate how acute stress impacts reward and punishment learning in men using a reinforcement-learning task. Sixty-two male participants performed the task whilst under stress and control conditions. We observed that acute stress impaired participants choice performance towards monetary gains, but not losses. To unravel the mechanism(s) underlying such impairment, we fitted a reinforcement-learning model to participants trial-by-trial choices. Computational modeling indicated that under acute stress participants learned more slowly from positive prediction errors -- when the outcomes were better than expected -- consistent with stress-induced dopamine disruptions. Such mechanistic understanding of how acute stress impairs reward learning is particularly important given the pervasiveness of stress in our daily life and the impact that stress can have on our wellbeing and mental health.",

    "abstract": "Various models (e.g., scalar, state-dependent network, and vector models) have been proposed to explain the global aspects of time perception, but they have not been tested against specific visual phenomena like perisaccadic time compression and novel stimulus time dilation. Here, in two separate experiments (N=31), we tested how the perceived duration of a novel stimulus is influenced by 1) a simultaneous saccade, in combination with 2) a prior series of repeated stimuli in human participants. This yielded a novel behavioral interaction: pre-saccadic stimulus repetition neutralizes perisaccadic time compression. We then tested these results against simulations of the above models. Our data yielded low correlations against scalar model simulations, high but non-specific correlations for our feedforward neural network, and correlations that were both high and specific for a vector model based on identity of objective and subjective time. These results demonstrate the power of global time perception models in explaining disparate empirical phenomena and suggest that subjective time has a similar essence to times physical vector.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDParkinsons disease (PD) is characterized by motor impairment, affecting quality of life and increasing fall risk, due to ineffective postural control. To this day, the diagnosis remains based on clinical approach. Similarly, motor evaluation is based on heterogeneous, operator-dependent observational criteria. A synthetic, replicable index to quantify motor impairment is still lacking. In this paper, we build upon the idea that the trunk is crucial in balance control. Hence, we have designed a new measure of postural stability which assesses the trunk displacement in relation to the center of mass, that we named trunk displacement index (TDI).\n\nMETHODSTwenty-three PD patients and twenty-three healthy controls underwent clinical (UPDRS-III) and motor examination (3D gait analysis). The TDI was extracted from kinematic measurements using a stereophotogrammetric system. A correlation analysis was performed to assess the relationship of TDI with typical gait parameters, to verify its biomechanical value, and UPDRS-III, to observe its clinical relevance. Finally, its sensitivity was measured, comparing pre- and post-L-DOPA subclinical intake.\n\nRESULTSThe TDI showed significant correlations with many gait parameters, including both velocity and stability characteristics of gait, and with the UPDRS-III. Finally, the TDI resulted capable in discriminating between off and on state in PD, whereas typical gait parameters failed two show any difference between those two conditions.\n\nCONCLUSIONSOur results suggest that the TDI may be considered a highly sensitive biomechanical index, reflecting the overall motor condition in PD, and provided of clinical relevance due to the correlation with the clinical evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Healthy ageing involves degeneration of the neuromuscular system which impacts movement control and proprioception. Yet the relationship between these sensory and motor deficits in upper limb reaching has not been examined in detail. Recently, we reported that age-related proprioceptive deficits were unrelated to accuracy in rapid arm movements, but whether this applied in motor tasks more heavily dependent on proprioceptive feedback was not clear. To address this, we have tested groups of younger and older adults on a force-field adaptation task under either full or limited visual feedback conditions and examined how performance related to dynamic proprioceptive acuity. Adaptive performance was similar between the age groups, regardless of visual feedback condition, although older adults showed increased after-effects. Physically inactive individuals made larger systematic (but not variable) proprioceptive errors, irrespective of age. However, dynamic proprioceptive acuity was unrelated to adaptation and there was no consistent evidence of proprioceptive recalibration with adaptation to the force-field for any group. Finally, in spite of clear age-dependent loss of spatial working memory capacity, we found no relationship between memory capacity and adaptive performance or proprioceptive acuity. Thus, non-clinical levels of deficit in dynamic proprioception, due to age or physical inactivity, do not affect force-field adaptation, even under conditions of limited visual feedback that might require greater proprioceptive control.",

    "abstract": "The cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as an attractive drug repurposing target for COVID-19. Here we combine genetics and chemical perturbation to demonstrate that ACE2-mediated entry of SARS-CoV and CoV-2 requires the cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) as an assisting cofactor: ablation of genes involved in HS biosynthesis or incubating cells with a HS mimetic both inhibit Spike-mediated viral entry. We show that heparin/HS binds to Spike directly, facilitates the attachment of viral particles to the cell surface to promote cell entry. We screened approved drugs and identified two classes of inhibitors that act via distinct mechanisms to target this entry pathway. Among the drugs characterized, Mitoxantrone is a potent HS inhibitor, while Sunitinib and BNTX disrupt the actin network to indirectly abrogate HS-assisted viral entry. We further show that drugs of the two classes can be combined to generate a synergized activity against SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathic effect. Altogether, our study establishes HS as an attachment factor that assists SARS coronavirus cell entry, and reveals drugs capable of targeting this important step in the viral life cycle.",

    "abstract": "It is aimed to deepen the understanding of the consumption carbon emissions of Chinese provinces, establish an accurate and feasible carbon emission prediction model, develop an urban low-carbon economy, and ensure the sustainable development of Chinese cities. Through the national statistical data information, based on the artificial neural network model, mathematical statistics and deep learning methods are used to learn and analyze the carbon emission data of various provinces in China from 1999 to 2019. The neural network toolbox in Matlab is used to program separately to realize the prediction of carbon emissions by different neural network models. After comparing and analyzing the accuracy and prediction performance, the optimal model for the prediction effect is selected. Finally, based on ArcGIS Engine (Arc Geographic Information Science Engine) and C#.NET platform, the call to Matlab neural network toolbox is realized. The selected model is embedded in the prediction system to complete the development of the entire system. The results show that the carbon emissions of residents in the north are distinctly higher than those in the south. Also, with the passage of time, the rate of carbon emissions continues to accelerate. Compared with other models, Elman neural network has higher accuracy and smaller error in carbon emission prediction. Compared to BP (Back Propagation) neural network, the accuracy is improved by 55.93%, and the prediction performance is improved by 19.48%. The prediction results show that China is expected to reach the peak of carbon emissions from 2027 to 2032. This investigation will provide a theoretical basis to control and plan carbon emissions from Chinese urban residents.",

We show that the human brain has experienced pronounced reduction of CG methylation during evolution, which significantly contributed to cell-type specific active regulatory regions. On the other hand, a substantial increase of CH methylation occurred during human brain evolution, associated with fine-tuning expression in development and neuronal subtypes. The majority of differential CG methylation between neurons and oligodendrocytes originated before the divergence of hominoids and catarrhine monkeys, and carries strong signal for genetic risk for schizophrenia. Remarkably, a substantial portion of differential CG methylation between neurons and oligodendrocytes emerged in the human lineage and harbors additional genetic risk for schizophrenia, implicating epigenetic evolution of human cortex in increased vulnerability to neuropsychiatric diseases.",

This short communication demonstrates how the mutation frequency patterns are evolving in 2,457 SAR-CoV-2 strains isolated from COVID-19 patients across diverse Indian states. We have identified 19 such variants showing contrasting mutational probabilities in the span of seven months. Out of these, 14 variants are showing increasing mutational probabilities suggesting their propagation with time due to their unexplored evolutionary advantages. Whereas mutational probabilities of five variants have significantly decreased in June onwards as compared to March/April, suggesting their termination with time. Further in-depth investigation of these identified variants will provide valuable knowledge about the evolution, infection strategies, transmission rates, and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.",

The learned conservation states show distinct enrichment patterns for genes, protein domains, and other regions of interest.

    "abstract": "PD-1 signalling downregulates the T cell response, promoting an exhausted state in tumor-infiltrating T cells, through mostly unveiled molecular mechanisms. Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission plays a crucial role to sustain T cell motility, proliferation, survival and glycolytic engagement and, interestingly, such processes are exactly those inhibited by PD-1 in tumor-infiltrating T cells. Here we show that the signature of PD-1pos CD8+ T cells infiltrating MC38-derived murine tumor mass is having downregulated Drp1 activity and more fused mitochondria, compared to PD-1neg counterparts. Also, PD-1pos lymphocytic elements infiltrating human colon cancer rarely express active Drp1. Mechanistically, PD-1 signalling directly prevents mitochondria fragmentation following T cell stimulation by downregulating Drp1 phosphorylation on Ser616, via regulation of the ERK1/2 and mTOR pathways. In addition, downregulation of Drp1 activity in tumor-infiltrating PD-1pos CD8+ T cells seems to be a mechanism exploited by PD-1 signalling to reduce motility and proliferation of these cells. Overall, our data indicate that the modulation of Drp1 activity in tumor-infiltrating T cells may become a valuable target to ameliorate the anti-cancer immune response in future immunotherapy approaches.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected millions of people worldwide. The characterization of the immunological mechanisms involved in disease symptomatology and protective response is important to advance in disease control and prevention. Humans evolved by losing the capacity to synthesize the glycan Gal1-3Gal{beta}1-(3)4GlcNAc-R (-Gal), which resulted in the development of a protective response against pathogenic viruses and other microorganisms containing this modification on membrane proteins mediated by anti--Gal IgM/IgG antibodies produced in response to bacterial microbiota. In addition to anti--Gal antibody-mediated pathogen opsonization, this glycan induces various immune mechanisms that have shown protection in animal models against infectious diseases without inflammatory responses. In this study, we hypothesized that the immune response to -Gal may contribute to the control of COVID-19. To address this hypothesis, we characterized the antibody response to -Gal in patients at different stages of COVID-19 and in comparison with healthy control individuals. The results showed that while the inflammatory response and the anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Spike) IgG antibody titers increased, reduction in anti--Gal IgE, IgM and IgG antibody titers and alteration of anti--Gal antibody isotype composition correlated with COVID-19 severity. The results suggested that the inhibition of the -Gal-induced immune response may translate into more aggressive viremia and severe disease inflammatory symptoms. These results support the proposal of developing interventions such as probiotics based on commensal bacteria with -Gal epitopes to modify the microbiota and increase the -Gal-induced protective immune response and reduce the severity of COVID-19.",

HERVs, which are transcribed in early embryos, are epigenetically silenced in somatic cells, except in pathological contexts. HERV-K is thought to protect the embryo from exogenous viral infection. However, uncontrollable HERV-K expression in somatic cells has been implicated in several diseases. Here, we show that SOX2, which plays a key role in maintaining pluripotency of stem cells, is critical for the transcription of HERV-K LTR5Hs. HERV-K can undergo retrotransposition within producer cells in the absence of Env expression. Furthermore, new HERV-K integration sites were identified in a long-term culture of induced pluripotent stem cells, which express SOX2. Together, these results suggest the possibility that the strict dependence of HERV-K on SOX2 have allowed contribution of HERV-K to the protection of early embryos during evolution while limiting potentially harmful effects of HERV-K retrotransposition on host genome integrity to these early embryos.",

Expression of S without any other viral proteins triggers syncytia formation. Type-I interferon (IFN)-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs), a family of restriction factors that block the entry of many viruses, inhibit S-mediated fusion, with IFITM1 being more active than IFITM2 and IFITM3. On the contrary, the TMPRSS2 serine protease, which is known to enhance infectivity of cell-free virions, processes both S and ACE2 and increases syncytia formation by accelerating the fusion process. TMPRSS2 thwarts the antiviral effect of IFITMs. Our results show that the pathological effects of SARS-CoV-2 are modulated by cellular proteins that either inhibit or facilitate syncytia formation.\n\nOne Sentence SummarySyncytia produced by SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and regulation of their formation by IFITMs and TMPRSS2.",

    "abstract": "The escape response and rhythmic swimming in zebrafish are distinct behaviors mediated by two functionally distinct motoneuron (Mn) types. The primary (1{degrees}Mn) type depresses, has a large quantal content (Qc), and a high release probability (Pr). Conversely, the secondary (2{degrees}Mn) type facilitates and has low and variable Qc and Pr. This functional duality matches well the distinct associated behaviors, with the 1{degrees}Mn providing the strong, singular C-bend initiating escape and the 2{degrees}Mn confers weaker, rhythmic contractions. Contributing to these functional distinctions is our identification of P/Q type calcium channels mediating transmitter release in 1{degrees}Mns and N type channels in 2{degrees}Mns. Remarkably, despite these functional and behavioral distinctions, all ~15 individual synapses on each muscle cell are shared by a 1{degrees}Mn bouton and at least one 2{degrees}Mn bouton. This novel blueprint of synaptic sharing provides an efficient way of controlling two different behaviors at the level of a single postsynaptic cell.",

    "abstract": "Oxytocin (OXT) is a neuropeptide originating in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, with a role in influencing various social behaviors. However, pinpointing its actions only during the time animals are performing specific behaviors has been difficult to study. Here we developed an optogenetic gene expression system designed to selectively label neuronal populations activated by OXT in the presence of blue-light, named \"OXTR-iTango2\". The OXTR-iTango2 was capable of inducing gene expression of a reporter gene in both human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells and neurons in a quantitative manner. In vivo expression of OXTR-iTango2 selectively labeled OXT-sensitive neurons in a blue-light dependent manner. Furthermore, we were able to detect a subset of dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) that receive OXT activation during social interaction. Thus, we provide a genetically-encoded, scalable optogenetic toolset to target neural circuits activated by OXT in behaving animals with a high temporal resolution.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies provide an increasingly understanding of how visual objects categories like faces or bodies are represented in the brain but also raised the question whether a category based or more network inspired models are more powerful. Two important and so far sidestepped issues in this debate concern, first, how major category attributes like the emotional expression directly influence category representation and second, whether category and attribute representation are sensitive to task demands. This study investigated the impact of a crucial category attribute like emotional expression on category activity and whether this varies with the participants task. Using (fMRI) we measured BOLD responses while participants viewed whole body expressions and performed either an explicit (emotion) or an implicit (shape) recognition task. Our results based on multivariate methods show that the type of task is the strongest determinant of brain activity and can be decoded in EBA, VLPFC and IPL. Brain activity was higher for the explicit task condition in VLPFC and was not emotion specific. This pattern suggests that during explicit recognition of the body expression, body category representation may be strengthened, and emotion and action related activity suppressed. Taken together these results stress the importance of the task and of the role of category attributes for understanding the functional organization of high level visual cortex.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMachine-assisted recognition of colorectal cancer (CRC) has been mainly focused on supervised deep learning that suffers from a significant bottleneck of requiring massive labeled data. We hypothesize that semi-supervised deep learning leveraging a small amount of labeled data with abundant available unlabeled data can provide a powerful alternative strategy.\n\nMethodWe proposed a semi-supervised model based on the mean teacher architecture that provides pathological predictions at both patch- and patient-levels. We demonstrated the general utility of the model utilizing 13,111 CRC whole slide images from 8,803 subjects gathered from 13 independent centers. We compared our proposed method with the prevailing supervised learning and six pathologists. Two extended evaluations on 15,000 lung and 294,912 lymph node images were also performed to confirm the generality of utility of semi-supervised learning for different cancers.\n\nResultsWith a small amount of labeled training patches ([~]3,150 labeled, [~]40,950 unlabeled or [~]6,300 labeled, [~]37,800 unlabeled), the semi-supervised learning (SSL) performed significantly better than the supervised learning (SL, which only used the labeled data) (area under the curve, AUC: 0.90 {+/-} 0.06 vs. 0.84 {+/-} 0.07, P value = 0.02 or AUC: 0.98 {+/-} 0.01 vs. 0.92 {+/-} 0.04, P value = 0.0004). Moreover, we found no significant difference between SL using massive [~]44,100 labeled patches and SSL ([~]6,300 labeled, [~]37,800 unlabeled) at patch-level diagnoses (AUC:0.98 {+/-} 0.01 vs. 0.987 {+/-} 0.01, P value = 0.134) and patient-level diagnoses (average AUC: 0.974 vs. 0.980, P value = 0.117). SSL was close to human pathologists in diagnosis performance (average AUC: 0.972 vs. 0.969). This extended evaluation on lung and lymph node also confirmed when a small amount of labeled data were used, SSL was better than SL, and achieved similar performance as that of SL with massive labeling.\n\nConclusionsWe reported that SSL can achieve excellent performance through a multi-center study. Because SSL dramatically reduces the need and cost of pathological image annotation, it has great potential to effectively build pathological artificial intelligence (AI) platforms in practice.",

Folding deficiencies are amenable to pharmacological correction (pharmacochaperoning), but the underlying mechanisms remain enigmatic. Ibogaine and its active metabolite noribogaine correct folding defects in the dopamine transporter (DAT), but they rescue only a very limited number of folding-deficient DAT mutants, which give rise to infantile Parkinsonism and dystonia. Herein, a series of analogs was generated by reconfiguring the complex ibogaine ring system and exploring the structural requirements for binding to wild type transporters, and for rescuing two equivalent synthetic folding-deficient mutants, SERT-PG601,602AA and DAT-PG584,585AA. The most active tropane-based analog (9b) was also an effective pharmacochaperone in vivo, in Drosophila harboring DAT-PG584,585AA and rescued six out of 13 disease-associated human DAT mutants in vitro. Hence, a novel lead pharmacochaperone has been identified that demonstrates medication development potential for patients harboring DAT mutants.",

    "abstract": "Type I collagen is the major structural component of bone where it exists as an (1)2(2)1 heterotrimer in all vertebrates. The osteogenesis imperfecta (oim) mouse model comprising solely homotrimeric (1)3 type I collagen, due to a dysfunctional 2 chain, has a brittle bone phenotype implying that the heterotrimeric form is required for physiological bone function. However, humans with rare null alleles preventing synthesis of the 2 chain have connective tissue and cardiovascular abnormalities (cardiac valvular Ehlers Danlos Syndrome), without evident bone fragility. Conversely a prevalent human single nucleotide polymorphism leading to increased homotrimer synthesis is associated with osteoporosis. Whilst the oim line is well-studied, whether homotrimeric type I collagen is functionally equivalent to the heterotrimeric form in bone has not been demonstrated. Col1a2 null and oim mouse lines were used in this study and bones analysed by microCT and 3-point bending. RNA was also extracted from heterozygote tissues and allelic discrimination analyses performed using qRT-PCR. Here we comprehensively show for the first time that mice lacking the 2(I) chain do not have impaired bone biomechanical or structural properties, unlike oim homozygous mice. However Mendelian inheritance was affected in male mice of both lines and male mice null for the 2 chain exhibited age-related loss of condition. The brittle bone phenotype of oim homozygotes could result from detrimental effects of the oim mutant allele, however, the phenotype of oim heterozygotes is known to be less severe. We used allelic discrimination to show that the oim mutant allele is not downregulated in heterozygotes. We then tested whether gene dosage was responsible for the less severe phenotype of oim heterozygotes by generating compound heterozygotes. Data showed that compound heterozygotes had impaired bone structural properties as compared to oim heterozygotes, albeit to a lesser extent than oim homozygotes. Hence, we concluded that the presence of heterotrimeric collagen-1 in oim heterozygotes alleviates the effect of the oim mutant allele but a genetic interaction between homotrimeric collagen-1 and the oim mutant allele leads to bone fragility.",

    "abstract": "Pregnancy requires adaptation of maternal physiology to enable normal fetal development. These adaptations are driven, in part, by the production of placental hormones. Failures in maternal adaptation and placental function lead to pregnancy complications including abnormal birthweight and gestational diabetes. However, we lack information on the full identity of hormones secreted by the placenta that mediate changes in maternal physiology. This study used an unbiased approach to characterise the secretory output of mouse placental endocrine cells and examined whether these data could identify placental hormones that are important for determining pregnancy outcome in humans. Secretome and cell peptidome analyses were performed using mass spectrometry on cultured primary trophoblast and fluorescence-activated sorted endocrine cells from pregnant mouse dams, and a placenta secretome map containing 319 proteins was generated. Gene ontology analyses showed that a high proportion of placental secretome proteins are involved in metabolic and immune modulation, signalling and growth. The majority of proteins identified are also expressed by human placenta and several have been reported to be dysregulated in pregnancy complications. Moreover, in proof of concept studies, we found that the relative abundance of secreted placental proteins (sFLT1/MIF and ANGPT2/MIF ratios) was increased in women at 12 weeks of pregnancy, prior to diagnosis of gestational diabetes. Finally, we identified several transcription factors that may be important for controlling hormone production by the placenta and associate with pregnancy outcome. Thus, our observations suggest that analysis of the placental secretome could lead to the identification of new placental biomarkers of pregnancy complications.",

It is thus vital to fully understand the biology of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 uses its spike glycoprotein to interact with the cell surface as a first step in the infection process. Using purified spike glycoprotein and lentivirus pseudotyped with spike glycoprotein, we now demonstrate that following engagement with the plasma membrane, SARS-CoV-2 undergoes rapid clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This suggests that transfer of viral RNA to the cell cytosol occurs from the lumen of the endosomal system, and importantly clathrin-heavy chain knockdown, which blocks clathrin-mediated endocytosis, reduces viral infectivity.

    "abstract": "Piwi proteins use guide piRNAs to repress selfish genomic elements, protecting the genomic integrity of gametes and ensuring the fertility of animal species. Efficient transposon repression depends on amplification of piRNA guides in the ping-pong cycle, which in Drosophila entails tight cooperation between two Piwi proteins, Aub and Ago3. Here we show that post-translational modification, symmetric dimethylarginine (sDMA), of Aub is essential for piRNA biogenesis, transposon silencing and fertility. Methylation is triggered by loading of a piRNA guide into Aub, which exposes its unstructured N-terminal region to the PRMT5 methylosome complex. Thus, sDMA modification is a signal that Aub is loaded with piRNA guide. Amplification of piRNA in the ping-pong cycle requires assembly of a tertiary complex scaffolded by Krimper, which simultaneously binds the N-terminal regions of Aub and Ago3. To promote generation of new piRNA, Krimp uses its two Tudor domains to bind Aub and Ago3 in opposite modification and piRNA-loading states. Our results reveal that post-translational modifications in unstructured regions of Piwi proteins and their binding by Tudor domains that are capable of discriminating between modification states is essential for piRNA biogenesis and silencing.\n\nHighlightsO_LIsDMA modification of Aub is essential for ping-pong cycle, transposon silencing and fertility.\nC_LIO_LIpiRNA loading triggers Aub sDMA modification by exposing its unstructured N terminal region to the methylosome complex.\nC_LIO_LIA single molecule of Krimp simultaneously binds piRNA-bound Aub and empty Ago3 to assemble ping-pong complex.\nC_LIO_LIThe distinct structure of two Tudor domains of Krimp ensures binding of Ago3 and Aub in opposite modification and piRNA-loading states.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Animals display remarkable diversity in rest and activity patterns that are regulated by endogenous foraging strategies, social behaviors, and predator avoidance. Alteration in the circadian timing of activity or the duration of rest-wake cycles provide a central mechanism for animals to exploit novel niches. The diversity of the 3000+ cichlid species throughout the world provides a unique opportunity to examine variation in locomotor activity and rest. Lake Malawi alone is home to over 500 species of cichlids that display divergent behaviors and inhabit well-defined niches throughout the lake. These species are presumed to be diurnal, though this has never been tested systematically. Here, we measure locomotor activity across the circadian cycle in 12 cichlid species from divergent lineages and distinct habitats. We document surprising variability in the circadian time of locomotor activity and the duration of rest. In particular, we identify a single species, Tropheops sp. \"red cheek\" that is nocturnal. Nocturnal behavior was maintained when fish were provided shelter, but not under constant darkness, suggesting it results from acute response to light rather than an endogenous circadian rhythm. Finally, we show that nocturnality is associated with increased eye size, suggesting a link between visual processing and nighttime activity. Together, these findings identify diversity of locomotor behavior in Lake Malawi cichlids and provide a system for investigating the molecular and neural basis underlying the evolution of nocturnal activity.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila melanogaster egg production, a proxy for fecundity, is an extensively studied life-history trait with a strong genetic basis. As eggs develop into larvae and adults, space and resource constraints can put pressure on the developing offspring, leading to a decrease in viability, body size, and lifespan. Our goal was to map the genetic basis of offspring number and weight under the restriction of a standard laboratory vial. We screened 143 lines from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel for offspring numbers and weights to create an  offspring index that captured the number vs. weight trade-off. We found 30 associated variants in 18 genes. Validation of hid, Sox21b, CG8312, and mub candidate genes using gene disruption mutants demonstrated a role in adult stage viability, while mutations in Ih and Rbp increased offspring number and increased weight, respectively. The polygenic basis of offspring number and weight, with many variants of small effect, as well as the involvement of genes with varied functional roles, support the notion of Fishers \"infinitesimal model\" for this life-history trait.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial flagellar protein export machinery promotes H+-coupled translocation of flagellar proteins to the cell exterior. When the cytoplasmic ATPase complex does not function, the transmembrane export gate complex opens its Na+ channel and continues protein transport. However, it remains unknown how. Here we report that the FlgN chaperone acts as a switch to activate a backup export mechanism for the ATPase complex by activating the Na+-driven engine. Impaired interaction of FlhA with the FliJ subunit of the ATPase complex increased Na+-dependence of flagellar protein export. Deletion of FlgN inhibited protein export in the absence of the ATPase complex but not in its presence. Gain-of-function mutations in FlhA restored not only the FlgN defect but also the FliJ defect. We propose that the interaction of FlgN with FlhA opens the Na+ channel in the export engine, thereby maintaining the protein export activity in the absence of the active ATPase complex.",

G4s form in the herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) genome during its viral cycle. Here by cross-linking/pull-down assay we identified ICP4 as the protein that most interacts with viral G4s during infection. In vitro and in infected cells, ICP4 specifically and directly bound and unfolded parallel G4s, including those present in HSV-1 immediate early gene promoters, and consequently induced transcription. This mechanism was also exploited by ICP4 to promote its own transcription. By proximity ligation assay we visualized ICP4 interaction at the single G4 in cells. G4 ligands inhibited ICP4 binding to G4s. Our results indicate the existence of a well-defined G4-viral protein network that regulates the productive HSV-1 cycle. They also point to G4s as elements that recruit transcription factors to activate transcription in cells.",

    "abstract": "In Escherichia coli, the operon responsible for the catabolism of L-arabinose is regulated by the dimeric DNA-binding protein AraC. In the absence of L-arabinose, AraC binds to the distal I1 and O2 half-sites, leading to repression of the downstream PBAD promoter. In the presence of the sugar, the dimer changes conformation and binds to the adjacent I1 and I2 half-sites, resulting in the activation of PBAD. Here we engineer blue light-inducible AraC dimers in Escherichia coli (BLADE) by swapping the dimerization domain of AraC with blue light-inducible dimerization domains. Using BLADE to overexpress proteins important for cell shape and division site selection, we reversibly control cell morphology with light. We demonstrate the exquisite light responsiveness of BLADE by employing it to create bacteriographs with an unprecedented quality. We then employ it to perform a medium-throughput characterization of 39 E. coli genes with poorly defined or completely unknown function. Finally, we expand the initial library and create a whole family of BLADE transcription factors (TFs), which we characterize using a novel 96-well light induction setup. Since the PBAD promoter is commonly used by microbiologists, we envisage that the BLADE TFs will bring the many advantages of optogenetic gene expression to the field of microbiology.",

    "abstract": "The arthropod melanization immune response is activated by extracellular protease cascades predominantly comprised of CLIP-domain serine proteases (CLIP-SPs) and serine protease homologs (CLIP-SPHs). In the malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae, the CLIP-SPHs SPCLIP1, CLIPA8, and CLIPA28 form the core of a hierarchical cascade downstream of mosquito complement that is required for melanization. However, our understanding of the regulatory relationship of the CLIP-SPH cascade with the catalytic CLIP-SPs driving melanization is incomplete. Here, we report on the development of a novel screen to identify melanization pathway components based on the quantitation of infection-induced excreta, eliminating the need for microdissections or hemolymph enzymatic assays. Using this screen, we identified CLIPC9 and subsequent functional analyses established that this protease is essential for the melanization of both Escherichia coli and the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei. Mechanistically, septic infection with E. coli promotes CLIPC9 cleavage and both full-length and cleaved CLIPC9 localize to this bacterium in a CLIPA8-dependent manner. The steady state level of CLIPC9 in the hemolymph is regulated by thioester-containing protein 1 (TEP1), suggesting it functions downstream of mosquito complement. In support, CLIPC9 cleavage is inhibited following SPCLIP1, CLIPA8, and CLIPA28 knockdown positioning it downstream of the CLIP-SPH cascade. Moreover, like CLIPA8 and CLIPA28, CLIPC9 processing is negatively regulated by serine protease inhibitor 2 (SRPN2). This report demonstrates how our novel excretion-based approach can be utilized to dissect the complex protease networks regulating mosquito melanization. Collectively, our findings establish that CLIPC9 is required for An. gambiae melanization and shed light on how the CLIP-SPH cascade regulates this potent immune response.\n\nAuthor SummaryMosquito vector competence for Plasmodium, antifungal defense, and lifespan are all influenced by the melanization response. Despite its importance, our understanding of the proteins comprising the An. gambiae melanization cascade is incomplete. To streamline the discovery of melanization pathway components in this disease vector, we developed a screening method that is able to identify proteins with far fewer mosquitoes than other approaches. This technique facilitated our discovery that the serine protease CLIPC9 is required for the melanization of bacteria and malaria parasites. CLIPC9 activation and localization to bacteria is regulated by members of the CLIPA subfamily, highlighting that these serine protease homologs broadly regulate the melanization immune response. Traditionally viewed as  co-factors for the prophenoloxidase activating CLIPBs, this work demonstrates that CLIPAs can also control the activation of the catalytic proteases driving melanization. This work identifies a new player in the melanization hierarchy and provides the field with an efficient approach for dissecting the complex protease cascades controlling this important immune response.",

    "abstract": "We show that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interacts with cell surface heparan sulfate and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) through its Receptor Binding Domain. Docking studies suggest a putative heparin/heparan sulfate-binding site adjacent to the domain that binds to ACE2. In vitro, binding of ACE2 and heparin to spike protein ectodomains occurs independently and a ternary complex can be generated using heparin as a template. Contrary to studies with purified components, spike protein binding to heparan sulfate and ACE2 on cells occurs codependently. Unfractionated heparin, non-anticoagulant heparin, treatment with heparin lyases, and purified lung heparan sulfate potently block spike protein binding and infection by spike protein-pseudotyped virus and SARS-CoV-2 virus. These findings support a model for SARS-CoV-2 infection in which viral attachment and infection involves formation of a complex between heparan sulfate and ACE2. Manipulation of heparan sulfate or inhibition of viral adhesion by exogenous heparin may represent new therapeutic opportunities.",

    "abstract": "Ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) are essential components of the ribosome and are among the most abundant macromolecules in the cell. To ensure high rRNA level, eukaryotic genomes contain dozens to hundreds of rDNA genes, however, only a fraction of the rRNA genes seems to be active, while others are transcriptionally silent. We found that individual rDNA genes have high level of cell-to-cell heterogeneity in their expression in Drosophila melanogaster. Insertion of heterologous sequences into rDNA leads to repression associated with reduced expression in individual cells and decreased number of cells expressing rDNA with insertions. We found that SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier) and SUMO ligase Ubc9 are required for efficient repression of interrupted rDNA units and variable expression of intact rDNA. Disruption of the SUMO pathway abolishes discrimination of interrupted and intact rDNAs and removes cell-to-cell heterogeneity leading to uniformly high expression of individual rDNA in single cells. Our results suggest that the SUMO pathway is responsible for both repression of interrupted units and control of intact rDNA expression.",

In this study, we performed a systematic review of published quantitative validation studies to clarify how different these measures are when compared to the underlying histology. We analysed the results from 43 studies applying meta-analysis tools, controlling for study sample size and using interactive visualization (https://neurolibre.github.io/myelin-meta-analysis). We report the overall estimates and the prediction intervals for the coefficient of determination and find that MT and relaxometry-based measures exhibit the highest correlations with myelin content.

    "abstract": "Despite decades of discussion in the neuroanatomical literature, the role of the synaptic  spinule in synaptic development and function remains elusive. Canonically, spinules are finger-like projections that emerge from postsynaptic spines and can become enveloped by presynaptic boutons. When a presynaptic bouton encapsulates a spinule in this manner, the membrane apposition between the spinule and surrounding bouton can be significantly larger than the membrane interface at the synaptic active zone. Hence, spinules may represent a mechanism for extrasynaptic neuronal communication, and/or may function as structural  anchors that increase the stability of cortical synapses. Yet despite their potential to impact synaptic function, we have little information on the percentages of developing and adult cortical bouton populations that contain spinules, the percentages of these cortical spinule-bearing boutons (SBBs) that contain spinules from distinct neuronal/glial origins, or whether the onset of activity or cortical plasticity are correlated with increased prevalence of cortical SBBs. Here, we employed 2D and 3D electron microscopy to determine the prevalence of spinules in excitatory presynaptic boutons at key developmental time points in the primary visual cortex (V1) of female and male ferrets. We find that the prevalence of SBBs in V1 increases across postnatal development, such that ~25% of excitatory boutons in late adolescent ferret V1 contain spinules. In addition, we find that a majority of spinules within SBBs at later developmental time points emerge from postsynaptic spines and adjacent boutons/axons, suggesting that synaptic spinules may enhance synaptic stability and allow for axo-axonal communication in mature sensory cortex.\n\nSignificance StatementSynaptic spinules are finger-like projections from neurites that can become completely embedded within presynaptic boutons, potentially enhancing synaptic communication and stability. Yet while their existence has been discussed for decades, spinule prevalence, projection origins, and relationship to neocortical sensory activity remain unknown. In this study, we employed 2D and 3D electron microscopy techniques to characterize the development of excitatory cortical spinule-bearing boutons (SBBs) and their relationship to sensory activity and plasticity. Our results demonstrate that neocortical presynaptic SBB prevalence is not correlated with the onset of sensory activity or heightened cortical plasticity, and that by late adolescence nearly one-quarter of presynaptic boutons contain a spinule. Hence, synaptic spinules may play progressively important roles in cortical function as these synapses mature.",

    "abstract": "Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is a major staple root crop of the tropics, originating from the Amazonas region. In this study, 3,354 cassava landraces and modern breeding lines from the Embrapa Cassava Germplasm Bank (CGB) were characterized. All individuals were subjected to genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), identifying 27,045 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). Identity-by-state and population structure analyses revealed a unique set of 1,536 individuals and 10 distinct genetic groups with heterogeneous linkage disequilibrium (LD). On this basis, 1,300 to 4,700 SNP markers were selected for large quantitative trait loci (QTL) detection. Identified genetic groups were further characterized for population genetics parameters including minor allele frequency (MAF), observed heterozygosity (Ho), effective population size estimate [Formula] and polymorphism information content (PIC). Selection footprints and introgressions of M. glaziovii were detected. Spatial population structure analysis revealed five ancestral populations related to distinct Brazilian ecoregions. Estimation of historical relationships among identified populations suggest earliest population split from Amazonas to Atlantic forest and Caatinga eco-regions and active gene flows. This study provides a thorough genetic characterization of ex situ germplasm resources from cassava center of origin, South America, with results shedding light on Brazilian cassava characteristics and its biogeographical landscape. These Findings support and facilitate the use of genetic resources in modern breeding programs including implementation of association mapping and genomic selection strategies.\n\nKey messageBrazilian cassava diversity was characterized through population genetics and clustering approaches, highlighting contrasted genetic groups, and spatial genetic differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Plant long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as important regulators of chromatin dynamics, impacting on transcriptional programs leading to different developmental outputs. The lncRNA AUXIN REGULATED PROMOTER LOOP (APOLO) directly recognizes multiple independent loci across the Arabidopsis genome and modulates their three-dimensional chromatin conformation, leading to transcriptional shifts. Here, we show that APOLO recognizes the locus encoding the root hair (RH) master regulator ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE 6 (RHD6) and controls RHD6 transcriptional activity leading to cold-enhanced RH elongation through the consequent activation of the transcription factor gene RHD6-like RSL4. Furthermore, we demonstrate that APOLO interacts with the transcription factor WRKY42 and modulates its binding to the RHD6 promoter. WRKY42 is required for the activation of RHD6 by low temperatures and WRKY42 deregulation impairs cold-induced RH expansion. Collectively, our results indicate that a novel ribonucleoprotein complex involving APOLO and WRKY42 forms a regulatory hub which activates RHD6 by shaping its epigenetic environment and integrates signals governing RH growth and development.\n\nSUMMARYThe lncRNA APOLO directly regulates the transcription of the root hair-master gene RHD6. In response to cold, APOLO is induced and it decoys the H3K27me3-binding protein LHP1 away from RHD6.

It is widely utilised across multiple fields of biology, with applications ranging from plants, to mammals, to microbes. A key feature of this system is its ability to allow recombination between mutant lox sites, traditionally named lox66 and lox71, to create a functionally inactive double mutant lox72 site. However, a large portion of the published literature has incorrectly annotated these mutant lox sites, which in turn can lead to difficulties in replication of methods, design of proper vectors, and confusion over the proper nomenclature.

Premature execution of a NOT gate before completion of its upstream computation introduces an irreversible error into the circuit. We developed a novel DNA gate design utilizing photocaging groups that prevents gate function until irradiation at a certain time-point. Optical activation provides temporal control over circuit performance by preventing premature computation and is orthogonal to all components of DNA computation devices.

    "abstract": "The Wolbachia Incompatible Insect Technique (IIT) shows promise as a method for eliminating invasive mosquitoes such as Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus)(Diptera: Culicidae) and reducing the incidence of vector-borne diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Successful implementation of this biological control strategy relies on high-fidelity separation of male from female insects in mass production systems for inundative release into landscapes. Processes for sex-separating mosquitoes are typically error prone, laborious and IIT programs run the risk of releasing Wolbachia infected females and replacing wild mosquito populations. We introduce a simple Markov Population Process (MPP) model for studying mosquito populations subjected to a Wolbachia-IIT program which exhibit an unstable equilibrium threshold. The model is used to study, in silico, scenarios that are likely to yield a successful elimination result. Our results suggest that elimination is best achieved by releasing males at rates that adapt to the ever-decreasing wild population, thus reducing the risk of releasing Wolbachia-infected females while reducing costs. While very high-fidelity sex-separation is required to avoid establishment, release programs tend to be robust to the release of a small number of Wolbachia-infected females. These findings will inform and enhance the next generation of Wolbachia-IIT control strategies that are already showing great promise in field trials.",
