    "abstract": "{beta}-Coronaviruses are a family of positive-strand enveloped RNA viruses that include the severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV2 (SARS-CoV2). While much is known regarding their cellular entry and replication pathways, their mode of egress remains uncertain; however, this is assumed to be via the biosynthetic secretory pathway by analogy to other enveloped viruses. Using imaging methodologies in combination with virus-specific reporters, we demonstrate that {beta}-Coronaviruses utilize lysosomal trafficking for egress from cells. This pathway is regulated by the Arf-like small GTPase Arl8b; thus, virus egress is insensitive to inhibitors of the biosynthetic secretory pathway. Coronavirus infection results in lysosome deacidification, inactivation of lysosomal degradation and disruption of antigen presentation pathways. This coronavirus-induced exploitation of lysosomes provides insights into the cellular and immunological abnormalities observed in patients and suggests new therapeutic modalities.",

    "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects cells through interaction of its spike protein (SARS2-S) with Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and activation by proteases, in particular transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Viruses can also spread through fusion of infected with uninfected cells. We compared the requirements of ACE2 expression, proteolytic activation, and the sensitivity to inhibitors for SARS2-S-mediated and SARS-CoV-S(SARS1-S)-mediated cell-cell fusion. SARS2-S-driven fusion was moderately increased by TMPRSS2 and strongly by ACE2, while SARS1-S-driven fusion was strongly increased by TMPRSS2 and less so by ACE2 expression. In contrast to SARS1-S, SARS2-S-mediated cell-cell fusion was efficiently activated by Batimastat-sensitive metalloproteases. Mutation of the S1/S2 proteolytic cleavage site reduced effector-target-cell fusion when ACE2 or TMPRSS2 were limiting and rendered SARS2-S-driven cell-cell fusion more dependent on TMPRSS2. When both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were abundant, initial target-effector-cell fusion was unaltered compared to wt SARS2-S, but syncytia remained smaller. Mutation of the S2 site specifically abrogated activation by TMPRSS2 for both cell-cell fusion and SARS2-S-driven pseudoparticle entry but still allowed for activation by metalloproteases for cell-cell fusion and by cathepsins for particle entry. Finally, we found that the TMPRSS2 inhibitor Bromhexine was unable to reduce TMPRSS2-activated cell-cell fusion by SARS1-S and SARS2-S as opposed to the inhibitor Camostat. Paradoxically, Bromhexine enhanced cell-cell fusion in the presence of TMPRSS2, while its metabolite Ambroxol exhibited inhibitory activity in some conditions. On Calu-3 lung cells, Ambroxol weakly inhibited SARS2-S-driven lentiviral pseudoparticle entry, and both substances exhibited a dose-dependent trend towards weak inhibition of authentic SARS-CoV-2.\n\nIMPORTANCECell-cell fusion allows the virus to infect neighboring cells without the need to produce free virus and contributes to tissue damage by creating virus-infected syncytia. Our results demonstrate that the S2 cleavage site is essential for activation by TMPRSS2 and unravel important differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, among those greater dependence of SARS-CoV-2 on ACE2 expression and activation by metalloproteases for cell-cell fusion. Bromhexine, reportedly an inhibitor of TMPRSS2, is currently tested in clinical trials against coronavirus disease 2019. Our results indicate that Bromhexine enhances fusion in some conditions. We therefore caution against use of Bromhexine in higher dosage until its effects on SARS-CoV-2 spike activation are better understood. The related compound Ambroxol, which similarly to Bromhexine is clinically used as an expectorant, did not exhibit activating effects on cell-cell fusion. Both compounds exhibited weak inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection at high concentrations, which might be clinically attainable for Ambroxol.",

    "abstract": "Perfusion of convalescent plasma (CP) has demonstrated a potential to improve the pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV-2, but procurement and standardization of CP are barriers to its wide usage. Many monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been developed but appear insufficient to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 unless two or three of them are being combined. Therefore, heterologous polyclonal antibodies of animal origin, that have been used for decades to fight against infectious agents might represent a highly efficient alternative to the use of CP or mAbs in COVID-19 by targeting multiple antigen epitopes. However, conventional heterologous polyclonal antibodies trigger human natural xenogeneic antibody responses particularly directed against animal-type carbohydrate epitopes, mainly the N-glycolyl form of the neuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) and the Gal 1,3-galactose (Gal), ultimately forming immune complexes and potentially leading to serum sickness or allergy. To circumvent these drawbacks, we engineered animals lacking the genes coding for the cytidine monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) and 1,3-galactosyl-transferase (GGTA1) enzymes to produce glyco-humanized polyclonal antibodies (GH-pAb) lacking Neu5Gc and -Gal epitopes. We found that pig IgG Fc domains fail to interact with human Fc receptors and thereby should confer the safety advantage to avoiding macrophage dependent exacerbated inflammatory responses, a drawback possibly associated with antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 or to avoiding a possible antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Therefore, we immunized CMAH/GGTA1 double knockout (DKO) pigs with the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) to elicit neutralizing antibodies. Animals rapidly developed a hyperimmune response with anti-SARS-CoV-2 end-titers binding dilutions over one to a million and end-titers neutralizing dilutions of 1:10,000. The IgG fraction purified and formulated following clinical Good Manufacturing Practices, named XAV-19, neutralized Spike/angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) interaction at a concentration < 1g/mL and inhibited infection of human cells by SARS-CoV-2 in cytopathic assays. These data and the accumulating safety advantages of using glyco-humanized swine antibodies in humans warranted clinical assessment of XAV-19 to fight against COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation is known to play critical roles in key biological processes. Most of our knowledge on regulatory impacts of DNA methylation has come from laboratory-bred model organisms, which may not exhibit the full extent of variation found in wild populations. Here, we investigated naturally-occurring variation in DNA methylation in a wild avian species, the white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis). This species offers exceptional opportunities for studying the link between genetic differentiation and phenotypic traits because of a non-recombining chromosome pair linked to both plumage and behavioral phenotypes. Using novel single-nucleotide resolution methylation maps and gene expression data, we show that DNA methylation and the expression of DNA methyltransferases are significantly higher in adults than in nestlings. Genes for which DNA methylation varied between nestlings and adults were implicated in development and cell differentiation and were located throughout the genome. In contrast, differential methylation between plumage morphs was localized to the non-recombining chromosome pair. One subset of CpGs on the non-recombining chromosome was extremely hypomethylated and localized to transposable elements. Changes in methylation predicted changes in gene expression for both chromosomes. In summary, we demonstrate changes in genome-wide DNA methylation that are associated with development and with specific functional categories of genes in white-throated sparrows. Moreover, we observe substantial DNA methylation reprogramming associated with the suppression of recombination, with implications for genome integrity and gene expression divergence. These results offer an unprecedented view of ongoing epigenetic reprogramming in a wild population.",

    "abstract": "Maximal growth rate is a basic parameter of microbial lifestyle that varies over several orders of magnitude, with doubling times ranging from a matter of minutes to multiple days. Growth rates are typically measured using laboratory culture experiments. Yet, we lack sufficient understanding of the physiology of most microbes to design appropriate culture conditions for them, severely limiting our ability to assess the global diversity of microbial growth rates. Genomic estimators of maximal growth rate provide a practical solution to survey the distribution of microbial growth potential, regardless of cultivation status. We developed an improved maximal growth rate estimator, and implement this estimator in an easy-to-use R package (gRodon), which outperforms the state-of-the-art growth estimator in multiple settings, including in a community context where we implement a novel species abundance correction for metagenomes. Additionally, we estimate maximal growth rates from over 200,000 genomes, metagenome-assembled genomes, and single-cell amplified genomes to survey growth potential across the range of prokaryotic diversity. We provide these compiled maximal growth rates in a publicly-available database (EGGO), which we use to illustrate how culture collections show a strong bias towards organisms capable of rapid growth. We demonstrate how this database can be used to propagate maximal growth rate predictions to organisms for which we lack genomic information, on the basis of 16S rRNA sequence alone. Finally, we observe a bias in growth predictions for extremely slow-growing organisms, ultimately leading us to suggest a novel evolutionary definition of oligotrophy based on the selective regime an organism occupies.\n\nSignificanceDespite the wide perception that microbes have rapid growth rates, many environments like seawater and soil are often dominated by microorganisms that can only grow very slowly. Our knowledge about growth is necessarily biased towards easily culturable organisms, which turn out to be those that tend to grow fast, because microbial growth rates have traditionally been measured using lab growth experiments. But how are potential growth rates distributed in nature? We developed a tool to predict maximum growth rate from an organisms genome sequence (gRodon). We predicted the growth rates of over 200,000 organisms and compiled these predictions in a publicly-available database (EGGO), which illustrates how current collections of cultured microbes are strongly biased towards fast-growing organisms.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRecently, a 23-month-old girl presented with increased granulocyte cystine levels, metabolic acidosis and symptoms of renal Fanconi syndrome. Cystinosis was suspected and treatment with electrolytes and cysteamine, a cystine depleting agent, was started that appeared effective. However, genetic testing did not detect any variants in CTNS (the gene affected in cystinosis) but instead revealed pathogenic variants in ATP6V1B1. ATP6V1B1 encodes the B1 subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), that is linked to autosomal recessive distal renal tubular acidosis, a metabolic disorder with an inappropriately alkaline urine and deafness. Here, the unknown link between ATP6V1B1 gene deficiency and proximal tubulopathy as well as a possible link to cystinosis pathophysiology was investigated.\n\nMethodsWe used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to selectively knockout the ATP6V1B1 or CTNS gene in human renal proximal tubule cells and compare their proteomic and metabolomic profile with isogenic wild type proximal tubule cells.\n\nResultsATP6V1B1 was expressed along the human distal but also the proximal segments of the nephron. Consistent with the clinical data, loss of ATP6V1B1 in renal proximal tubule cells resulted in increased cystine levels with autophagy activation. Further, omics profiling showed that both ATP6V1B1-/- and CTNS-/- cells are in metabolic acidosis with impaired autophagy and signs of proximal tubular epithelial dysfunction.\n\nConclusionWe identified the lysosomal V-ATPase B1 subunit to play an important role in proximal tubule function, regulating cystine transport and autophagy in human renal proximal tubule cells through its interaction with cystinosin and mTOR-signaling.",

Total mRNA and protein were extracted and effects of TSG on the expression levels of osteopontin (OPN), osteocalcin (OCN), Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), Osterix and Col1a1 were detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR. Western Blotting was used to detect the inhibitory effect of TSG on KDM5A. BMSCs were transfected with Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting KDM5A (si-KMD5A) and pcDNA3.1 KMD5A. TSG significantly increased the activity of ALP and the number of alkaline phosphatase clones and calcified nodule formation. The OPN, OCN, Runx2 and Osterix expression levels were significantly increased among the osteoblasts after TSG treatment. The mechanism study showed that the effect of TSG is realized by inhibiting KDM5A. KDM5A signaling may be involved in the regulation of osteogenic differentiation of rBMSC.

    "abstract": "Investigations using noninvasive functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have provided significant insights into the unique functional organization and profound importance of the human default mode network (DMN), yet these methods are limited in their ability to resolve network dynamics across multiple timescales. Electrophysiological techniques are critical to address these challenges, yet few studies have explored the neurophysiological underpinnings of the DMN. Here we investigate the brain-wide electrophysiological organization of the DMN in a common large-scale network framework consistent with prior fMRI studies. We used brain-wide intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings, and evaluated intra- and cross-network interactions during the resting-state and cognition. Our analysis revealed significantly greater intra-DMN phase iEEG synchronization in the slow-wave (< 4 Hz) while DMN interactions with other brain networks was higher in all higher frequencies. Crucially, slow-wave intra-DMN synchronization was observed in the task-free resting-state and during verbal memory encoding and recall. Compared to resting-state, intra-DMN phase synchronization was significantly higher during both memory encoding and recall. Slow-wave intra-DMN phase synchronization increased during successful memory retrieval, highlighting its behavioral relevance. Finally, analysis of nonlinear dynamic causal interactions revealed that the DMN is a causal outflow network during both memory encoding and recall. Our findings identify dynamic spectro-temporal network features that allow the DMN to maintain a balance between stability and flexibility, intrinsically and during task-based cognition, provide novel insights into the neurophysiological foundations of the human DMN, and elucidate network mechanisms by which it supports cognition.",

Our results show that the amyloid plaque formation is critically dependent on the secretion rate of amyloid {beta} (A{beta}), which is proportional to the product of neural density and neural activity. Neural atrophy is similarly related to the secretion rate of A{beta}. Due to a heterogeneous distribution of neural density and brain activity throughout the brain, amyloid plaque formation and neural death occurs heterogeneously in the brain. The geometry of the brain and microglia migration in the parenchyma bring more complexity into the system and result in a diverse amyloidosis and dementia pattern of different brain regions. Although the pattern of amyloidosis in the brain cortex from in-silico results is similar to experimental autopsy findings, they mismatch at the central regions of the brain, suggesting that ACH is not able to explain the whole course of AD without considering other factors, such as tau-protein aggregation or neuroinflammation.",

    "abstract": "Inhibitory interneurons are believed to realize critical gating functions in cortical circuits, but it has been difficult to ascertain the content of gated information for well characterized interneurons in primate cortex. Here, we address this question by characterizing putative interneurons in primate prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex while monkeys engaged in attention demanding reversal learning. We find that subclasses of narrow spiking neurons have a relative suppressive effect on the local circuit indicating they are inhibitory interneurons. One of these interneuron subclasses showed prominent firing rate modulations and (35-45 Hz) gamma synchronous spiking during periods of uncertainty in both, lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In LPFC this interneuron subclass activated when the uncertainty of attention cues was resolved during flexible learning, whereas in ACC it fired and gamma-synchronized when outcomes were uncertain and prediction errors were high during learning. Computational modeling of this interneuron-specific gamma band activity in simple circuit motifs suggests it could reflect a soft winner-take-all gating of information having high degree of uncertainty. Together, these findings elucidate an electrophysiologically-characterized interneuron subclass in the primate, that forms gamma synchronous networks in two different areas when resolving uncertainty during adaptive goal-directed behavior.",
