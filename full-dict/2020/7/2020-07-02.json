    "abstract": "The ethylene response factor (ERF) transcription factor is a subfamily of AP2/ERF superfamily in plants, which plays multiple roles in plant growth and development as well as stress response. In this study, we found that the GsERF gene from BW69 line of wild soybean held a constitutive expression pattern and induced by aluminum stress with more transcripts in soybean root. The putative GsERF protein containing an AP2 domain was in the nucleus and transactivation activity. In addition, the overexpression of the GsERF gene enhanced root relative length rate in Arabidopsis and shallow staining by hematoxylin under the treatments of AlCl3. The ethylene synthesis related genes such as ACS4, ACS5 and ACS6 are upregulated in the GsERF overexpressed plants than those in wild type plants under the treatment of AlCl3. Furthermore, expression levels of stress/ABA-responsive marker genes, including ABI1, ABI2, ABI4, ABI5, RD29B and RD22 in transgenic lines compared with those in wild type Arabidopsis were affected by AlCl3 treatments. Taken together, the results indicate that overexpression of GsERF may enhance aluminum tolerance through an ethylene-mediated pathway and/or ABA signaling pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "To adopt terminal neural fates, neural progenitors respond to a combination of molecular factors, the interplay between which remains difficult to untangle. In this work, we interrogated the type-II neuroblast lineages in the developing Drosophila brain using targeted single-cell mRNA sequencing. We used pseudotime analysis to group cells by their differentiation state and subsequently used marker gene analysis to identify genes that may play a role in neural fate specification. To aid the candidate gene selection process, we created MiCV, a scRNA-seq data visualization web tool that integrates results from the multifaceted analysis, displays the co-expression pattern of multiple genes, and provides an automated gene function curating feature. In situ profiling of these mRNAs further recovered the spatial information lacking in the single-cell data. Combining prior knowledge, in silico analysis, and in situ evidence, we characterize the molecular landscape of the developing Drosophila type-II neuroblast lineages and provide a roadmap for navigating the more complex brains.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPain is one of the primary symptoms of endometriosis, a chronic inflammatory condition characterised by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus. Endometriosis-associated pain is commonly considered as nociceptive in nature but its clinical presentation suggests that it might have neuropathic-like properties in a subgroup of patients.\n\nMethodsThis is a cross sectional study using an online survey. The survey was distributed by patient support websites. The survey was composed of validated questionnaires assessing pain symptoms, psychological measures and questions about number of surgeries.\n\nMain results and the role of chanceWe had 1417 responses which met the inclusion criteria. Using standard painDETECT cut-off scores, we found that pain was classified as neuropathic in 40% of patients and as mixed neuropathic/nociceptive in a further 35%. In line with observations in other neuropathic conditions, the neuropathic subgroup reported higher pain intensities, greater psychological distress and cognitive impairment. Neuropathic pain was also more likely in those with more surgeries to the abdomen and a longer history of pain. As revealed by a cluster analysis, those with a neuropathic pain component could further be divided into two subgroups based on their sensory profile.\n\nConclusionsThe data presented here indicate that endometriosis-associated pain includes a neuropathic-like component in a substantial proportion of women. Although further investigation is required, our finding challenges the current conceptualisation of endometriosis-associated pain as nociceptive and advocates for a new perspective on this type of pain, which is so debilitating to a large number of women.",

    "abstract": "Simple sensory stimuli or motor outputs engage large populations of neurons in the mammalian cortex. When stimuli or outputs repeat, the robust population response contrasts with fluctuating responses of individual neurons, known as trial-by-trial variability. To understand this apparent discrepancy, a detailed identification of the underlying spatiotemporal correlations is required. Here, we analyze spatial correlations in the instantaneous fluctuations between neurons relative to the neuronal population. Using 2-photon imaging of visual and auditory responses in primary cortices of awake mice, we show that these correlations grow linearly with the size of the observed cortical area. We extend these observations to the cortical mesoscale by analyzing local field potentials in behaving nonhuman primates. In network simulations, we demonstrate this linear growth in spatial correlation to emerge at criticality. Our findings suggest that trial-by-trial variability is a signature of critical dynamics in cortex maintaining robust, long-range spatial correlations among neurons.",

    "abstract": "There has been increasing interest in jointly studying structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) derived from diffusion and functional MRI. However, several fundamental problems are still not well considered when conducting such connectome integration analyses, e.g., \"Which structure (e.g., gray matter, white matter, white surface or pial surface) should be used for defining SC and FC and exploring their relationships\", \"Which brain parcellation should be used\", and \"How do the SC and FC correlate with each other and how do such correlations vary in different locations of the brain?\". In this work, we develop a new framework called surface-based connectivity integration (SBCI) to facilitate the integrative analysis of SC and FC with a re-thinking of these problems. We propose to use the white surface (the interface of white matter and gray matter) to build both SC and FC since diffusion signals are in the white matter while functional signals are more present in the gray matter. SBCI also represents both SC and FC in a continuous manner at very high spatial resolution on the white surface, avoiding the need of pre-specified atlases which may bias the comparison of SC and FC. Using data from the Human Connectome Project, we show that SBCI can create reproducible, high quality SC and FC, in addition to three novel imaging biomarkers reflective of the similarity between SC and FC throughout the brain, called global, local, and discrete SC-FC coupling. Further, we demonstrate the usefulness of these biomarkers in finding group effects due to biological sex throughout the brain.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionThe purpose of this study was to reveal a functional role for arm-swing asymmetry during gait in healthy adults. The primary aim was to identify differences in propulsive and collision work between sides at either end of the double-support phase of slow-walking (WDS). The secondary aim was to identify differences between sides in propulsive and collision work done at either end of the single-support phase (WSS) and the effect of arm-swing asymmetry on this difference. It was hypothesized that differences between sides would be evident during the double-support phase and that these differences would be coherent with differences in single-support control symmetry. It was also hypothesized that left-side dominant arm-swing would reduce the collision work done on the dominant lower-limb side.\n\nMethodsA secondary analysis of slow-walking trials of 25 healthy, uninjured adults was undertaken where a principal component analysis of kinematic data was carried out to generate the movement synergies (PMk). Independent variables included the tightness of neuromuscular control (Nk) which was formulated from the first PMk and arm-swing asymmetry which was quantified using the directional Arm-swing asymmetry index (dASI). Dependent variables included the difference between double-support collision and propulsive work (WDS) and a ratio consisting of the difference between single-support collision and propulsive work of both sides (WSS). A linear mixed-effects model was utilized for aim 1 while a multiple linear regression analysis was undertaken for aim 2.\n\nResultsHealthy adult gait was accompanied by a left-side dominant arm-swing on average as seen elsewhere. For aim 1, Nk demonstrated a significant negative effect on WDS while sidedness had a direct negative effect and indirect positive effect through Nk on WDS. The most notable finding was the effect of a crossover interaction between dASI and Nk which demonstrated a highly significant positive effect on Wss. All main-effects in aim 2 were in the hypothesized direction but were insignificant.\n\nInterpretationThe aim 1 hypothesis was supported while the aim 2 hypothesis was not supported. Nk exhibited opposing signs between ipsilateral and contralateral WBAM regulation, revealing a differential control strategy while the effect of sidedness on WDS was evident. The findings from aim 2 describe a relationship between arm-swing asymmetry and the magnitude of lower-limb mechanical work asymmetry that is cohesive with the sidedness effect found in aim 1. Individuals with left-side dominant arm-swing had an increased collision work indicative of a lateralised preference for WBAM regulation. Evidence was therefore put forward that arm-swing asymmetry during gait is related to footedness. Future studies should look to formally confirm this finding. Implications for further research into dynamic balance control mechanisms are also discussed.\n\nHighlightsO_LILeft-side dominant arm-swing was found to be related to the degree of lower-limb mechanical work asymmetry.\nC_LIO_LIThe relationship between arm-swing asymmetry and lower-limb mechanical work symmetry was explained by a moderating effect of neuromuscular control.\nC_LIO_LIA differential control on single-and double-support phases was demonstrated by the neuromuscular system, supporting previous studies and this control may be heavily influenced by sidedness.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Benefiting from advances in high-throughput experimental techniques, important regulatory roles of miRNAs, lncRNAs, and proteins, as well as biological property information, are gradually being complemented. As the key data support to promote biomedical research, domain knowledge such as intermolecular relationships that are increasingly revealed by molecular genome-wide analysis is often used to guide the discovery of potential associations. However, the method of performing network representation learning from the perspective of the global biological network is scarce. These methods cover a very limited type of molecular associations and are therefore not suitable for more comprehensive analysis of molecular network representation information. In this study, we propose a computational model based on the Biological network for predicting potential associations between miRNAs and diseases called iMDA-BN. The iMDA-BN has three significant advantages: I) It uses a new method to describe disease and miRNA characteristics which analyzes node representation information for disease and miRNA from the perspective of biological networks. II) It can predict unproven associations even if miRNAs and diseases do not appear in the biological network. III) Accurate description of miRNA characteristics from biological properties based on high-throughput sequence information. The iMDA-BN predictor achieves an AUC of 0.9145 and an accuracy of 84.49% on the miRNA-disease association baseline dataset, and it can also achieve an AUC of 0.8765 and an accuracy of 80.96% when predicting unknown diseases and miRNAs in the biological network. Compared to existing miRNA-disease association prediction methods, iMDA-BN has higher accuracy and the advantage of predicting unknown associations. In addition, 45, 49, and 49 of the top 50 miRNA-disease associations with the highest predicted scores were confirmed in the case studies, respectively.",

A rigorous methodology could thus be of great interest, that is at the aim of our study which consists of evaluating the physico-chemical parameters of different phases used to make thus multiple emulsions.In our study, physico chemical parameters such as conductivity, pH, density, viscosity, and surface tension have been studied by direct measurement using equipment and also by means of suitable mounting.The results showed that the pH and the surface tension have an important role in the prediction of the stability of emulsions, these latter must be of the same order of magnitude. For all phases conductivity does not have too much interest apart from helping to determine the type of the emulsion.STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE Multiple emulsions are of great therapeutic interest especially in the administration of medicament which can be inactivated by digestive enzymes, moreover the researches of formulation not being often easy, a control of the physicochemical parameters of the different phases would be of great interest in rapid formulations and at low cost.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flows through the perivascular spaces (PVSs) surrounding cerebral arteries. Revealing the mechanisms driving that flow could bring improved understanding of brain waste transport and insights for disorders including Alzheimers disease and stroke. In vivo velocity measurements of CSF in surface PVSs in mice have been used to argue that flow is driven primarily by the pulsatile motion of artery walls -- perivascular pumping. However, fluid dynamics theory and simulation have predicted that perivascular pumping produces flows differing from in vivo observations starkly, particularly in the phase and relative amplitude of flow oscillation. Here we show that coupling theoretical and simulated flows to realistic end boundary conditions, using resistance and compliance values measured in mice, results in velocities that match observations closely in phase, relative amplitude of oscillation, and mean flow speed. This new, quantitative agreement among theory, simulation, and in vivo measurement further supports the idea that perivascular pumping is a primary CSF driver in physiological conditions.",

Activation of allatostatin receptor type C (AstR-C), a G Protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), upon stimulation with its endogenous ligand, allatostatin C (AST-C), leads to the inhibition of juvenile hormone (JH) secretion that consequently regulates physiology of insects. Here we conducted in silico and in vitro approaches to characterize the structure and function of AstR-C of Thaumetopoea pityocampa (T.pit), a well-known pest in Mediterranean countries. The sequence of AstR-C and AST-C were derived from whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. Resonance energy transfer (RET) methods were used to investigate the downstream effectors of the receptor and the temporal kinetics of G protein activation. Three-dimensional (3D) structure of AstR-C constructed via homology modeling methods was subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and docking studies to identify the orthosteric pocket. Our results showed that T.pit AstR-C couples to Gi/o subtype of G proteins at sub-nanomolar ranges of the the ligand with the G protein recruitment and activation kinetics of [~]4 and 6 seconds, respectively, when 1 nM AST-C is administered. At the increasing concentration of native ligand, {beta}arrestin was shown to be recruited at nanomolar ranges the ligand. Docking and MD simulation studies revealed the importance of extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) in T.pit AstRC/AST-C interaction, and combination of in silico and in vitro methods supported the accuracy of the built model and the predicted orthosteric pocket. Q2716.55 (Ballesteros-Weinstein generic numbering) was found to have a substantial role in G protein dependent activation of AstR-C possibly via contributing to the flexibility of the structure.",

    "abstract": "The Ebola virus (EBOV) hijacks normal physiological processes by apoptotic mimicry in order to be taken up by the cell it infects. The initial adhesion of the virus to the cell is based on the interaction between T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain protein, TIM, on the cell-surface and phosphatidylserine (PS) on the viral outer surface. Therefore, it is important to understand the interaction between EBOV/PS and TIM, with selective blocking of the interaction as a potential therapy. Recent experimental studies have shown that for TIM-dependent EBOV entry, a Mucin-like Domain (MLD) with a length of at least 120 amino acids is required, possibly due to the increase of area of the PS-coated surface sampled. We examine this hypothesis by modeling the process of TIM-PS adhesion using a coarse-grained molecular model. We find that the strength of bound PS\u2212TIM pairs is essentially independent of TIM length. TIMs with longer MLDs have higher average binding strengths because of an increase in the probability of binding between EBOV and TIM proteins. Similarly, we find that for larger persistence length (less flexible) the average binding force decreases, again because of a reduction in the probability of binding.Statement of Significance This work studies the mechanism of TIM-dependent adhesion of the Ebola virus to a cell. Through coarse grained modeling we show that longer TIM stalks adhere more easily as they can sample a larger area, thus offering a mechanistic interpretation of an experimental finding. Better mechanistic understanding can lead to therapeutic ideas for blocking adhesion.View Full Text",

In addition, planarians have other features that share morphology and function with the tissues of many other animals, including an outer mucociliary epithelium that drives planarian locomotion and is very similar to the epithelial linings of the human lung and oviduct. Planarians occupy a broad range of ecological habitats and are known to be sensitive to changes in their environment. Yet, despite their potential to provide valuable insight to many different fields, very few planarian species have been developed as laboratory models for mechanism-based research.\n\nHere we describe a previously undocumented planarian isolate, Girardia sp.

    "abstract": "The perturbations of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) were found to be the main cause of cancer. Previous gene relationship prediction methods which were trained with non-disease gene interaction data were not compatible to map the PPI network in cancer. Therefore, we established a novel cancer specific PPI prediction method dubbed NECARE, which was based on relational graph convolutional network (R-GCN) with knowledge-based features. It achieved the best performance with a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) = 0.84{+/-}0.03 and an F1 = 91{+/-}2% comparing with other methods. With NECARE, we mapped the cancer interactome atlas and revealed that the perturbations of PPIs were enriched on 1362 genes, which were named cancer hub genes. Those genes were found to over-represent with mutations occurring at protein-macromolecules binding interfaces. Furthermore, over 42% of cancer treatment-related genes belonged to hub genes, which were significantly related to the prognosis of 32 types of cancers. Finally, by coimmunoprecipitation, we confirmed that the NECARE prediction method was highly reliable with a 90% accuracy. Overall, we provided the novel network-based protein-protein interaction prediction method and mapped the perturbation of cancer interactome.

    "abstract": "The bilaterally symmetric animals (Bilateria) are considered to comprise two monophyletic groups, Protostomia and Deuterostomia. Protostomia contains the Ecdysozoa and the Lophotrochozoa; Deuterostomia contains the Chordata and the Xenambulacraria (Hemichordata, Echinodermata and Xenacoelomorpha). Their names refer to a supposed distinct origin of the mouth (stoma) in the two clades, but these groups have been differentiated by other embryological characters including embryonic cleavage patterns and different ways of forming their mesoderm and coeloms. Deuterostome monophyly is not consistently supported by recent studies. Here we compare support for Protostomia and Deuterostomia using five recently published, phylogenomic datasets. Protostomia is always strongly supported, especially by longer and higher quality genes. Support for Deuterostomia is always equivocal and barely higher than support for paraphyletic alternatives. Conditions that can cause tree reconstruction errors - inadequate models, short internal branch, faster evolving genes, and unequal branch lengths - correlate with statistical support for monophyletic deuterostomes. Simulation experiments show that support for Deuterostomia could be explained by systematic error. A survey of molecular characters supposedly diagnostic of deuterostomes shows many are not valid synapomorphies. The branch between bilaterian and deuterostome common ancestors, if real, is very short. This finding fits with growing evidence suggesting the common ancestor of all Bilateria had many deuterostome characteristics. This finding has important implications for our understanding of early animal evolution and for the interpretation of some enigmatic Cambrian fossils such as vetulicolians and banffiids.",

In this study, we investigated over 7,000 SARS-CoV-2 datasets to unveil both intrahost and interhost diversity. Our intrahost and interhost diversity analyses yielded three major observations. First, the mutational profile of SARS-CoV-2 highlights iSNV and SNP similarity, albeit with high variability in C>T changes. Second, iSNV and SNP patterns in SARS-CoV-2 are more similar to MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV-1. Third, a significant fraction of small indels fuel the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTThe COVID-19 pandemic took us ill-prepared and tackling the many challenges it poses in a timely manner requires world-wide collaboration. Our ability to study the SARS-COV-2 virus and its interactions with its human host in molecular terms efficiently and collaboratively becomes indispensable and mission-critical in the race to develop vaccines, drugs, and neutralizing antibodies. There is already a significant corpus of 3D structures related to SARS and MERS coronaviruses, and the rapid generation of new structures demands the use of efficient tools to expedite the sharing of structural analyses and molecular designs and convey them in their native 3D context in sync with sequence data and annotations. We developed iCn3D (pronounced \u201cI see in 3D\u201d) 1 to take full advantage of web technologies and allow scientists of different backgrounds to perform and share sequence-structure analyses over the Internet and engage in collaborations through a simple mechanism of exchanging \u201clifelong\u201d web links (URLs). This approach solves the very old problem of \u201csharing of molecular scenes\u201d in a reliable and convenient manner. iCn3D links are sharable over the Internet and make data and entire analyses findable, accessible, and reproducible, with various levels of interoperability. Links and underlying data are FAIR 2 and can be embedded in preprints and papers, bringing a 3D live and interactive dimension to a world of text and static images used in current publications, eliminating at the same time the need for arcane supplemental materials. This paper exemplifies iCn3D capabilities in visualization, analysis, and sharing of COVID-19 related structures, sequence variability, and molecular interactions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Introduction Commercially available SARS-CoV-2 serological assays based on different viral antigens have been approved for the qualitative determination of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. However, there is limited published data associating the results from commercial assays with neutralizing antibodies.Methods 67 specimens from 48 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and a positive result by the Roche Elecsys SARS-CoV-2, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, or EUROIMMUN SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays and 5 control specimens were analyzed for the presence of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Correlation, concordance, positive percent agreement (PPA), and negative percent agreement (NPA) were calculated at several cutoffs. Results were compared in patients categorized by clinical outcomes.Results The correlation between SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titer (EC50) and the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays was 0.29, 0.47, and 0.46 respectively. At an EC50 of 1:32, the concordance kappa with Roche was 0.49 (95% CI; 0.23-0.75), with Abbott was 0.52 (0.28-0.77), and with EUROIMMUN was 0.61 (0.4-0.82). At the same neutralizing titer, the PPA and NPA for the Roche was 100% (94-100) &amp; 56% (30-80); Abbott was 96% (88-99) &amp; 69% (44-86); and EUROIMMUN was 91% (80-96) &amp; 81% (57-93) for distinguishing neutralizing antibodies. Patients who died, were intubated, or had a cardiac injury from COVID-19 infection had significantly higher neutralizing titers relative to those with mild symptoms.Conclusion COVID-19 patients generate an antibody response to multiple viral proteins such that the calibrator ratios on the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays are all associated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Nevertheless, commercial serological assays have poor NPA for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, making them imperfect proxies for neutralization.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Diet selection is a fundamental aspect of animal behavior with numerous ecological and evolutionary implications. While the underlying mechanisms are complex, the availability of essential dietary nutrients can strongly influence diet selection behavior. The gut microbiome has been shown to metabolize many of these same nutrients, leading to the untested hypothesis that intestinal microbiota may influence diet selection. Here we show that germ-free mice colonized by gut microbiota from three rodent species with distinct foraging strategies differentially selected diets that varied in macronutrient composition. Specifically, we found that herbivore-conventionalized mice voluntarily selected a higher protein:carbohydrate ratio diet, while omnivore- and carnivore-conventionalized mice selected a lower P:C ratio diet. In support of the long-standing hypothesis that tryptophan - the essential amino acid precursor of serotonin - serves as a peripheral signal regulating diet selection, bacterial genes involved in tryptophan metabolism and plasma tryptophan availability prior to the selection trial were significantly correlated with subsequent voluntary carbohydrate intake. Finally, herbivore-conventionalized mice exhibited larger intestinal compartments associated with microbial fermentation, broadly reflecting the intestinal morphology of their donor species. Together, these results demonstrate that gut microbiome can influence host diet selection behavior, perhaps by mediating the availability of essential amino acids, thereby revealing a novel mechanism by which the gut microbiota can influence host foraging behavior.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEThe behavior of diet choice or diet selection can have wide-reaching implications, scaling from individual animals to ecological and evolutionary processes. Previous work in this area has largely ignored the potential for intestinal microbiota to modulate these signals. This notion has been highly speculated for years but has not yet been explicitly tested. Here we show that germ-free mice colonized by differential microbiomes (from wild rodents with varying natural feeding strategies) exhibited significant differences in their voluntary dietary selection. Specifically, differences in voluntary carbohydrate selection were associated with plasma amino acid levels and bacterial genes involved in the metabolism of tryptophan. Together, these results demonstrate a role for the microbiome in host nutritional physiology and behavior.",

    "abstract": "Regulatory sRNAs in photosynthetic cyanobacteria have been reported, but the lack of plausible RNA chaperones involved in this regulation appears enigmatic. Here, we analyzed the full ensemble of cellular RNAs and proteins using gradient profiling by sequencing (Grad-seq) in Synechocystis 6803. Complexes with overlapping subunits such as the CpcG1-type versus the CpcL-type phycobilisomes or the PsaK1 versus PsaK2 photosystem I pre(complexes) could be distinguished supporting a high quality of the approach. Clustering of the in-gradient distribution profiles followed by several additional criteria yielded a short list of potential RNA chaperones that include a YlxR homolog and a cyanobacterial homolog of the KhpA/B complex. The data suggest previously undetected complexes between accessory proteins and CRISPR-Cas systems, such as a Csx1-Csm6 ribonucleolytic defense complex. Moreover, the exclusive association of either RpoZ or 6S RNA with the core RNA polymerase complex and the existence of a reservoir of inactive sigma-antisigma complexes is suggested.

    "abstract": "Reactivation of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) from latently infected T cells is a critical barrier to successfully eradicate HIV-1 from patients. Latency models in Jurkat T-cells reveal that individual cells reactivate in an all-or-none fashion when exposed to latency reversal agents (LRAs). Remarkably, this heterogeneity arises within a clonal cell population of genetically identical cells containing a single copy of the provirus integrated at the same genomic site. To characterize these single-cell responses, we leverage the classical Luria-Delbr\u00fcck fluctuation test where single cells are isolated from a clonal population, and exposed to LRAs after a period of colony expansion. If cellular responses are purely random, then the fraction of reactivating cells should have minimal colony-to-colony fluctuations given the large number of cells present after weeks of colony growth. In contrast, data shows considerable colony-to-colony fluctuations with the fraction of reactivating cells following a skewed distribution. Systematic measurements of fluctuations over time in combination with mathematical modeling uncovers the existence of a heritable memory that regulates HIV-1 reactivation, where single cells are in a LRA-responsive state for a few weeks before switching back to an irresponsive state. These results have enormous implications for designing therapies to purge the latent reservoir and illustrate the utility of fluctuation-based assays to uncover hidden transient cellular states underlying phenotypic heterogeneity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesThis study aimed to measure the variability in carbapenem susceptibility conferred by different OxaAb variants, characterise the molecular evolution of oxaAb and elucidate the contribution of OxaAb and other possible carbapenem resistance factors in the clinical isolates using WGS and LC-MS/MS.\n\nMethodsDisc susceptibility and MIC broth microdilution tests were performed on ten clinical A. baumannii isolates and interpreted according to CLSI guidelines. Imipenem and meropenem MICs were evaluated for all oxaAb variants cloned into susceptible A. baumannii CIP70.10 and increased adeABC efflux pump gene expression BM4547 backgrounds, with and without their natural promoters. Molecular evolution analysis of the oxaAb variants was performed using FastTree and SplitsTree4. Resistance determinants were studied in the clinical isolates using WGS and LC-MS/MS analysis.\n\nResultsOxaAb(82), OxaAb(83), OxaAb(107), and OxaAb(110) carrying I129L and L167V substitutions increased carbapenem MICs when transferred into susceptible A. baumannii backgrounds without an upstream IS element. Carbapenem resistance was conferred with the addition of their natural upstream ISAba1 promoter. LC-MS/MS analysis on the original clinical isolates showed no differences in expression levels of proteins commonly associated with carbapenem resistance.\n\nConclusionsISAba1-driven overexpression of OxaAb variants with substitutions I129L and L167V confers carbapenem resistance with no need for additional resistance mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1 elite controllers (EC) are a rare but heterogeneous group of HIV-1-infected individuals who are able to suppress viral replication in the absence of antiretroviral therapy. The mechanisms of how EC achieve undetectable viral loads remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate host plasma metabolomics and targeted plasma proteomics in a Swedish HIV-1 cohort including EC and treatment-naive viremic progressors (VP) as well as HIV-negative individuals (HC) to get insights into mechanisms governing EC status. Metabolites belonging to antioxidant defense had higher levels in EC relative to VP while inflammation markers were increased in VP compared to EC. Only four plasma proteins (CCL4, CCL7, CCL20, and NOS3) were increased in EC compared to HC and CCL20/CCR6 axis can play important role. Our study suggests that low-level inflammation and oxidative stress at physiological levels could be important factors contributing to control of viral replication.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryHIV-1 elite controllers had a distinct lipid profile, reduced inflammation, and increased antioxidant defense that might contribute to elite control status.",

    "abstract": "The nosocomial pathogen, Clostridioides difficile, is a spore-forming obligate anaerobe that depends on its aerotolerant spore form to transmit infections. Functional spore formation depends on the assembly of a proteinaceous layer known as the coat around the developing spore. In C. difficile, coat assembly depends on the conserved coat protein, SpoIVA, and the clostridial-specific coat protein, SipL, which directly interact. Mutations that disrupt their interaction cause coat to mislocalize and decrease functional spore formation. In B. subtilis, SpoIVA is an ATPase that uses ATP hydrolysis to help drive its polymerization around the forespore. Loss of SpoIVA ATPase activity impairs B. subtilis SpoIVA encasement of the forespore and activates a quality control mechanism that eliminates these defective cells. Since this mechanism is lacking in C. difficile, we tested whether mutations in C. difficiles SpoIVA ATPase motifs impair functional spore formation. Disrupting C. difficile SpoIVA ATPase motifs resulted in phenotypes that were typically >104 less severe than the equivalent mutations in B. subtilis. Interestingly, mutation of ATPase motif residues predicted to abrogate SpoIVA binding to ATP decreased SpoIVA-SipL interaction, whereas mutation of ATPase motif residues predicted to disrupt ATP hydrolysis but retain binding to ATP enhanced SpoIVA-SipL interaction. When a sipL mutation known to reduce binding to SpoIVA was combined with a spoIVA mutation predicted to prevent SpoIVA binding to ATP, spore formation was severely exacerbated. Since this phenotype is allele-specific, our data implies that SipL recognizes the ATP-bound form of SpoIVA and highlights the importance of this interaction for functional C. difficile spore formation.\n\nImportanceThe aerotolerant spores formed by the major nosocomial pathogen Clostridioides difficile are its primary infectious particle. However, the mechanism by which this critical cell type is assembled remains poorly characterized, especially with respect to its protective coat layer. We previously showed that binding between the spore morphogenetic proteins, SpoIVA and SipL, regulates coat assembly around the forespore. SpoIVA is widely conserved among spore-forming bacteria, and its ATPase activity is essential for Bacillus subtilis to form functional spores. In this study, we determined that mutations in C. difficile SpoIVAs ATPase motifs result in relatively minor defects in spore formation in contrast with B. subtilis. Nevertheless, our data suggest that SipL preferentially recognizes the ATP-bound form of SpoIVA and identify a specific residue in SipLs C-terminal LysM domain that is critical for recognizing the ATP-bound form of SpoIVA. These findings advance our understanding of how SpoIVA-SipL interactions regulate C. difficile spore assembly.",

    "abstract": "SummaryCRISPR-Cas defense systems have been coopted multiple times in nature for guide RNA-directed transposition by Tn7-like elements. Prototypic Tn7 uses dedicated proteins for two targeting pathways, one targeting a neutral and conserved attachment site in the chromosome and a second directing transposition into mobile plasmids facilitating cell-to-cell transfer. We show that Tn7-CRISPR-Cas elements evolved a system of guide RNA categorization to accomplish the same two-pathway lifestyle. Selective regulation of specialized guide RNAs allows long-term memory for access to chromosomal sites upon entry into a new host, while conventional CRISPR features maintain the ability to continually acquire guide RNAs to new plasmid and phage targets. Transposon-encoded guide RNAs are also privatized to be recognized only by the transposon-adapted system working with selective regulation to guard against toxic self-targeting by endogenous CRISPR-Cas defense systems. This information reveals new avenues to engineer guide RNAs for enhanced CRISPR-Cas functionality for genome modification.Competing Interest StatementCornell University has filed patent applications related to this work with JEP as inventor.View Full Text",

Here we show that mice with liver-specific Zfp125 knockdown exhibited lower respiratory quotient, reduced glycemia and pyruvate-stimulated liver glucose output, and higher levels of {beta}-hydroxyl-butyrate. Microarray and ChIP-seq studies identified Zfp125 peaks in the promoter of 135 metabolically relevant genes, including genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis, e.g. Ppara, Cpt1a, Bdh1 and Hmgcs2. Repression by Zfp125 involved recruitment of the corepressors Kap1 and the histone methyl transferase Setdb1, increasing the levels of H3K9me3, a heterochromatin marker of gene silencing. The resulting increase in acetyl-CoA levels accelerated gluconeogenesis through allosteric activation of pyruvate carboxylase. Zfp125 knockdown in isolated mouse hepatocytes amplified the induction of ketogenesis by glucagon or insulin resistance, whereas the expression of key gluconeogenic genes Pck1 and G6pc was amplified by Zfp125.

    "abstract": "Crown birds are subdivided into two main groups, Palaeognathae and Neognathae, that can be distinguished, among other means, by the organization of the bones in their pterygoidpalatine complex (PPC). Shape variation of the vomer, which is the most anterior part of the PPC, was recently analysed with help of geometric morphometrics to discover morphological differences between palaeognath and neognath birds. Based on this study, the vomer was identified as sufficient to distinguish the two main groups (and even some inclusive neognath groups) and their cranial kinetic system. As there are notable size differences between the skulls of Palaeognathae and Neognathae, we here investigate the impact of allometry on vomeral shape and its implication for taxonomic classification by re-analysing the data of the previous study. Different types of multivariate statistical analyses reveal that taxonomic identification based on vomeral shape is strongly impaired by allometry, as the error of correct identification is high when shape data is corrected for size. This finding is evidenced by a great overlap between palaeognath and neognath subclades in morphospace. Correct taxonomic identification is further impeded by the convergent presence of a flattened vomeral morphotype in multiple neognath subclades. As the evolution of cranial kinesis has been linked to vomeral shape in the original study, the correlation between shape and size of the vomer across different bird groups found in the present study questions this conclusion. In fact, cranial kinesis in crown birds results from the loss of the jugal-postorbital bar in the temporal region and ectopterygoid in the PPC and the combination of a mobilized quadratezygomatic arch complex and a flexible PPC. Therefore, we can conclude that vomer shape itself is not a suitable proxy for exploring the evolution of cranial kinesis in crown birds and their ancestors. In contrast, the evolution of cranial kinesis needs to be viewed in context of the braincase, quadrate-zygomatic arch and the whole pterygoid-palatine complex.",

Increasingly, researchers in synthetic biology are relying on and developing massive libraries of plasmids as vectors for directed evolution, combinatorial gene circuit tests, and for CRISPR multiplexing.

Crucially, researchers often elect to forego the cumbersome verification step, potentially leading to reproducibility and\u2014 depending on the application\u2014security issues. In order to facilitate plasmid verification to improve the quality and reproducibility of life science research, we developed a fast, simple, and open source pipeline for assembly and verification of plasmid sequences from Illumina reads. We demonstrate that our pipeline, which relies on de novo assembly, can also be used to detect contaminating sequences in plasmid samples. In addition to presenting our pipeline, we discuss the role for verification and quality control in the increasingly complex life science workflows ushered in by synthetic biology.Competing Interest StatementJP holds an equity stake in GenoFAB Inc., a company that may benefit or may be perceived to benefit from the publication of this article.

We apply confocal and electron microscopy to create a developmental time-series in the glasswing butterfly, Greta oto, comparing transparent and non-transparent wing regions. We find that scale precursor cell density is reduced in transparent regions, and cytoskeletal organization differs between flat scales in opaque regions, and thin, bristle-like scales in transparent regions. We also reveal that sub-wavelength nanopillars on the wing membrane are wax-based, derive from wing epithelial cells and their associated microvillar projections, and demonstrate their role in enhancing-anti-reflective properties.

We show here that a novel RyR1-selective inhibitor, 6,7-(methylenedioxy)-1-octyl-4-quinolone-3-carboxylic acid (Compound 1, Cpd1), effectively prevents and treats MH and heat stroke in several mouse models relevant to MH. Cpd1 reduced resting intracellular Ca2+, inhibited halothane- and isoflurane-induced Ca2+ release, suppressed caffeine-induced contracture in skeletal muscle, reduced sarcolemmal cation influx, and prevented or reversed the fulminant MH crisis induced by isoflurane anesthesia and rescued animals from heat stroke caused by environmental heat stress. Notably, Cpd1 has great advantages of better water solubility and rapid clearance in vivo over dantrolene.

The circular peptide backbone contributes to remarkable stability, conferring partial proteolytic resistance and structural integrity under a wide temperature and pH range.

The protein was crystallised using the hanging drop vapour diffusion method and the structure solved to a resolution of 1.8 \u00c5. Sequence alignment against 17 previously characterised circular bacteriocins revealed the presence of conserved charged and aromatic residues. Alanine substitution mutagenesis validated the importance of these residues. Minimum inhibitory concentration analysis of these Ala mutants showed Phe8Ala and Trp45Ala mutants displayed a 48- and 32-fold reduction in activity, compared to wild type. Lys19Ala mutant displayed the weakest activity, with a 128-fold reduction.

We report a novel pooled screening approach for a wider range of cellular and subtle subcellular phenotypes. Machine learning and convolutional neural network models are trained on the subcellular phenotype to be queried. Genome-wide screening then utilizes cells stably expressing dCas9 (CRISPRi), photoactivatable fluorescent protein (PA-mCherry), and a lentiviral guide RNA (gRNA) pool. Cells are screened by microscopy and classified by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, which precisely identify the genetically altered phenotype. Cells with the phenotype of interest are photoactivated, isolated via flow cytometry, and the gRNAs are identified by sequencing. A proof-of-concept screen accurately identified PINK1 as essential for Parkin recruitment to mitochondria. A genome-wide screen identified factors mediating TFEB relocation from the nucleus to the cytosol upon prolonged starvation. Twenty of the sixty-four hits called by the neural network model were independently validated, revealing new effectors of TFEB subcellular localization.

    "abstract": "Although several studies have explored microbial communities in different terrestrial subsurface ecosystems, little is known about the diversity of their metabolic processes and survival strategies. The advance of bioinformatic tools is allowing the description of novel and not-yet cultivated microbial lineages in different ecosystems, due to the genome reconstruction approach from metagenomic data. The recovery of genomes has the potential of revealing novel lifestyles, metabolic processes and ecological roles of microorganisms, mainly in ecosystems that are largely unknown, and in which cultivation could be not viable. In this study, through shotgun metagenomic data, it was possible to reconstruct several genomes of cultivated and not-yet cultivated prokaryotic lineages from a quartzite cave, located in Minas Gerais state, Brazil, which showed to possess a high diversity of genes involved with different biogeochemical cycles, including reductive and oxidative pathways related to carbon, sulfur, nitrogen and iron. Tree genomes were selected, assigned as Truepera sp., Ca. Methylomirabilis sp. and Ca. Koribacter sp. based on their lifestyles (radiation resistance, anaerobic methane oxidation and potential iron oxidation) for pangenomic analysis, which exhibited genes involved with different DNA repair strategies, starvation and stress response. Since these groups have few reference genomes deposited in databases, our study adds important genomic information about these lineages. The combination of techniques applied in this study allowed us to unveil the potential relationships between microbial genomes and their ecological processes with the cave mineralogy, as well as to discuss their implications for the search for extant lifeforms outside our planet, in silica- and iron-rich environments, especially on Mars.",

    "abstract": "Astrocytes are essential cells of the central nervous system, characterized by dynamic relationships with neurons that range from functional metabolic interactions and regulation of neuronal firing activities, to the release of neurotrophic and neuroprotective factors. In Parkinsons disease (PD), dopaminergic neurons are progressively lost during the course of the disease, but the effects of PD on astrocytes and astrocyte-to-neuron communication remains largely unknown. This study focuses on the effects of the PD-related mutation LRRK2 G2019S in astrocytes generated from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells. We report the alteration of extracellular vesicle (EV) biogenesis in astrocytes, and we identify the abnormal accumulation of key PD-related proteins within multi vesicular bodies (MVBs). We found that dopaminergic neurons internalize astrocyte-secreted EVs and that LRRK2 G2019S EVs are abnormally enriched in neurites and fail to provide full neurotrophic support to dopaminergic neurons. Thus, dysfunctional astrocyte-to-neuron communication via altered EV biological properties may participate in the progression of PD.",

    "abstract": "Atypical Aeromonas salmonicida (aAs) and Vibrionaceae related species are bacteria routinely recovered from diseased ballan wrasse used as cleaner fish in Atlantic salmon farming. Autogenous multivalent vaccines formulated from these microorganisms are widely used by the industry to protect farmed wrasse despite limited experimental proof that they are primary pathogens. In this study, the components of a commercial multivalent injection wrasse vaccine were tested for infectivity, pathogenicity and virulence via intra peritoneal injection at pre-deployment size (25-50g) and the efficacy of the vaccine for protection against aAs assessed. Injection with 3.5x109, 8x109 1.8x109 and 5x109 cfu/fish of Vibrio splendidus, V. ichthyoenteri, Aliivibrio logeii and A. salmonicida, respectively, did not cause significant mortalities, lesions or clinical signs after a period of 14 days. IP injection with both aAs and Photobacterium indicum successfully reproduced the clinical signs and internal lesions observed during natural outbreaks of the disease. Differences in virulence (LD50 at day 8-post infection of 3.6x106 cfu/fish and 1.6x107 cfu/fish) were observed for two aAs vapA type V isolates. In addition, the LD50 for Photobacterium indicum was 2.2x107 cfu/fish. The autogenous vaccine was highly protective against the two aAs vapA type V isolates after 700-degree days of immunisation. The RPSFINAL values for the first isolate were 95 and 91% at 1x106 cfu/fish and 1x107 cfu/fish, respectively, and 79% at 1x107 cfu/fish for the second isolate tested. In addition, significantly higher anti aAs seral antibodies (IgM), were detected by ELISA in vaccinated fish in contrast with control (mock vaccinated) fish. These results suggest wrasse can be effectively immunised and protected against aAs infection by injection with oil adjuvanted vaccines prepared with inactivated homologous isolates. Further work should assess the efficacy of vaccination against other isolates that have proven to be pathogenic such as aAs type VI and Photobacterium indicum and explore the feasibility of immersion vaccination. In addition, a full characterisation of aAs isolates within the same vapA types should be performed as differences in virulence between vapA type V isolates were observed and partial genome analysis indicated small but potentially important genomic differences in these isolates.",

Here we develop a fitness model that predicts growth rates of common resistance mutants from their effects on cell metabolism. We map metabolic effects of resistance mutations in drug-free environments and under drug challenge; the resulting fitness trade-off defines a Pareto surface of resistance evolution. We predict evolutionary trajectories of dosage-dependent growth rates and resistance levels, as well as the prevalent resistance mechanism depending on drug and nutrient levels. These predictions are confirmed by empirical growth curves and genomic data of E. coli populations.

However, the molecular logic that governs the establishment and organization of cortical cell types remains elusive, largely due to the large number of cell classes undergoing dynamic cell-state transitions over extended developmental timelines. Here, we have generated a comprehensive single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell ATAC-seq atlas of the developing mouse neocortex, sampled every day throughout embryonic corticogenesis. We computationally reconstruct developmental trajectories across the diversity of cortical cell classes, and infer the gene regulatory programs that accompany their lineage bifurcation decisions and their differentiation trajectories. Finally, we demonstrate how this developmental map pinpoints the origin of lineage-specific developmental abnormalities linked to aberrant corticogenesis in mutant animals. The data provides the first global picture of the regulatory mechanisms governing cellular diversification in the neocortex.Competing Interest StatementP.A. is a SAB member in System 1 Biosciences and Foresite Labs and is a co-founder of FL60.

    "abstract": "Paired fins are a defining feature of the jawed vertebrate body plan, but their evolutionary origin remains unresolved. Gegenbaur proposed that paired fins evolved as gill arch serial homologues, but this hypothesis is now widely discounted, owing largely to the presumed distinct embryonic origins of these structures from mesoderm and neural crest, respectively. Here, we use cell lineage tracing to test the embryonic origin of the pharyngeal and paired fin skeleton in the skate (Leucoraja erinacea). We find that while the jaw and hyoid arch skeleton derive from neural crest, and the pectoral fin skeleton from mesoderm, the gill arches are of dual origin, receiving contributions from both germ layers. We propose that gill arches and paired fins are serially homologous as derivatives of a continuous, dual-origin mesenchyme with common skeletogenic competence, and that this serial homology accounts for their parallel anatomical organization and shared responses to axial patterning signals.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The genetic risk for prostate cancer has been governed by a few rare variants with high penetrance and over 150 commonly occurring variants with lower impact on risk; however, most of these variants have been identified in studies containing exclusively European individuals. People of non-European ancestries make up less than 15% of prostate cancer GWAS subjects. Across the globe, incidence of prostate cancer varies with population due to environmental and genetic factors. The discrepancy between disease incidence and representation in genetics highlights the need for more studies of the genetic risk for prostate cancer across diverse populations. To better understand the genetic risk for prostate cancer across diverse populations, we performed PrediXcan and GWAS in a cohort of 4,769 self-identified African American (2,463 cases and 2,306 controls), 2,199 Japanese American (1,106 cases and 1,093 controls), and 2,147 Latin American (1,081 cases and 1,066 controls) individuals from the Multiethnic Genome-wide Scan of Prostate Cancer. We used prediction models from 46 tissues in GTEx version 8 and five models from monocyte transcriptomes in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Artherosclerosis. Across the three populations, we predicted 19 gene-tissue pairs, including five unique genes, to be significantly (lfsr &lt; 0.05) associated with prostate cancer. One of these genes, NKX3-1, replicated in a larger European cohort. At the SNP level, 110 SNPs met genome-wide significance in the African American cohort while 123 SNPs met significance in the Japanese American cohort. Fine mapping revealed three significant independent loci in the African American cohort and two significant independent loci in the Japanese American cohort. These identified loci confirm findings from previous GWAS of prostate cancer in diverse cohorts while PrediXcan-identified genes suggest potential new directions for prostate cancer research in populations across the globe.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "PurposeExome and genome sequencing have proven to be effective tools for the diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), but large fractions of NDDs cannot be attributed to currently detectable genetic variation. This is likely, at least in part, a result of the fact that many genetic variants are difficult or impossible to detect through typical short-read sequencing approaches.\n\nMethodsHere, we describe a genomic analysis using Pacific Biosciences circular consensus sequencing (CCS) reads, which are both long (>10 kb) and accurate (>99% bp accuracy). We used CCS on six proband-parent trios with NDDs that were unexplained despite extensive testing, including genome sequencing with short reads.\n\nResultsWe identified variants and created de novo assemblies in each trio, with global metrics indicating these data sets are more accurate and comprehensive than those provided by short-read data. In one proband, we identified a likely pathogenic (LP), de novo L1-mediated insertion in CDKL5 that results in duplication of exon 3, leading to a frameshift. In a second proband, we identified multiple large de novo structural variants, including insertion-translocations affecting DGKB and MLLT3, which we show disrupt MLLT3 transcript levels. We consider this extensive structural variation likely pathogenic.\n\nConclusionThe breadth and quality of variant detection, coupled to finding variants of clinical and research interest in two of six probands with unexplained NDDs strongly support the value of long-read genome sequencing for understanding rare disease.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTInflammatory control is critical to recovery from respiratory viral infection. Acetylcholine (ACh) secreted from non-neuronal sources, including lymphocytes, plays an important, albeit underappreciated, role in regulating immune-mediated inflammation. This study was designed to explore the role of ACh in acute viral infection and recovery. Using the murine model of influenza A, cholinergic status in the lungs and airway was examined over the course of infection and recovery. The results showed that airway ACh remained constant through the early stage of infection and increased during the peak of the acquired immune response. As the concentration of ACh increased, cholinergic lymphocytes appeared in the airway and lungs. Cholinergic capacity was found primarily in CD4 T cells, but also in B cells and CD8 T cells. The cholinergic CD4+ T cells bound to influenza-specific tetramers at the same frequency as their conventional (i.e., non-cholinergic) counterparts. In addition, they were retained in the lungs throughout the recovery phase and could still be detected in the resident memory regions of the lung up to two months after infection. Histologically, cholinergic lymphocytes were found in direct physical contact with activated macrophages throughout the lung. When ACh production was inhibited, mice exhibited increased tissue inflammation, altered lung architecture, and delayed recovery. Together, these findings point to a previously unrecognized role for ACh in the transition from active immunity to recovery and pulmonary repair following respiratory viral infection.View Full Text",

In our previous study, the uptake of the cow\u2019s milk protein \u03b2-lactoglobulin (BLG) by THP-1 macrophages varied after applying different processing methods and was positively correlated with hydrophobicity and aggregation. Here we applied the same 3 processing methods: wet heating (60 \u00b0C) and low- or high-temperature (50 \u00b0C or 130 \u00b0C, respectively) dry heating in absence or presence of reducing sugars (i.e. glucose, lactose or galacto-oligosaccharide) to lysozyme and thyroglobulin, which have different pI or molecular weight compared to BLG, respectively. Uptake of the soluble fraction was tested in two types of, genetically homogeneous, antigen-presenting cells (macrophages and dendritic cells derived from THP-1 monocytes). This revealed a strong correlation between the uptake of the different protein samples by macrophages and dendritic cells, and confirmed the key role of hydrophobicity, over aggregation, in determining the uptake. Several uptake routes were shown to contribute to the uptake of BLG by macrophages. However, cytokine responses following exposure of macrophages to BLG samples were not related to the levels of uptake. Heat-treatment-mediated increases in uptake did thus not induce a response in our read-out systems. Together, our results demonstrate that heat-treatment-induced increased hydrophobicity is the prime driving factor in uptake, but not in cytokine production, by THP-1 macrophages.View Full Text",

Some metabolites often have interesting health-promoting activities. This study addressed the anti-tumoural properties of Penicillium purpurogenum isolated from a polluted lagoon in Northeastern Brazil.\n\nMethodsThe extract obtained from the polished environment strain P. purpurogenum was fermented, filtered, concentrated and lyophilized, giving rise to the Ethyl Acetate Extracellular Extract (EAE). The metabolites of the extracellular extract of P. purpurogenum were studied using direct infusion mass spectrometry. The solid Ehrlic tumor model was used to evaluate the extract antitumor activity. Female Swiss mice were divided in groups (n=10/group) as follow: Negative control (CTL-) treated with phosphate buffered solution; Positive Control (CTL+) treated with cyclophosphamide (25mg/mL); Extracts treatment at doses 4, 20 and 100mg/Kg; Animals without tumor or treatment (Sham); and animals without tumor treated with intermediate dose (EAE20). All treatments were performed intraperitoneally, daily during 15 days. After, the animals were eutanized and the tumor, lymphoid organs and serum were used for immunological, histological and biochemical parameters evaluation.\n\nResultsThe extract was rich in meroterpenoids. All doses of the extract significantly reduced tumor size compared to CLT- and were associated with 100% survival. Histologically, the 20 and 100mg/kg doses reduced tumour-associated inflammation and tumour necrosis. The extract also reduced cellular infiltration of lymphoid organs and circulating TNF- levels when compared with CLT-. The extract did not induce weight loss and renal or hepatic toxic changes.\n\nConclusionsThese results indicate that P. purpurogenum from a polluted marine environment produce hybrid natural products of the terpenoid pathway that exhibits immunomodulatory and antitumor properties in vivo. Thus, fungal fermentation is a biotechnological approach for the production of antitumour agents.",

    "abstract": "Anatomically and biophysically detailed data-driven neuronal models have become widely used tools for understanding and predicting the behavior and function of neurons. Due to the increasing availability of experimental data from anatomical and electrophysiological measurements as well as the growing number of computational and software tools that enable accurate neuronal modeling, there are now a large number of different models of many cell types available in the literature. These models were usually built to capture a few important or interesting properties of the given neuron type, and it is often unknown how they would behave outside their original context. In addition, there is currently no simple way of quantitatively comparing different models regarding how closely they match specific experimental observations. This limits the evaluation, re-use and further development of the existing models. Further, the development of new models could also be significantly facilitated by the ability to rapidly test the behavior of model candidates against the relevant collection of experimental data. We address these problems for the representative case of the CA1 pyramidal cell of the rat hippocampus by developing an open-source Python test suite, which makes it possible to automatically and systematically test multiple properties of models by making quantitative comparisons between the models and electrophysiological data. The tests cover various aspects of somatic behavior, and signal propagation and integration in apical dendrites. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we applied our tests to compare the behavior of several different hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell models from the ModelDB database against electrophysiological data available in the literature, and concluded that each of these models provides a good match to experimental results in some domains but not in others. We also show how we employed the test suite to aid the development of models within the European Human Brain Project (HBP), and describe the integration of the tests into the validation framework developed in the HBP, with the aim of facilitating more reproducible and transparent model building in the neuroscience community.\n\nAuthor summary\n\nAnatomically and biophysically detailed neuronal models are useful tools in neuroscience because they allow the prediction of the behavior and the function of the studied cell type under circumstances that are hard to investigate experimentally. However, most detailed biophysical models have been built to capture a few selected properties of the real neuron, and it is often unknown how they would behave under different circumstances, or whether they can be used to successfully answer different scientific questions. To help the modeling community develop better neural models, and make the process of model building more reproducible and transparent, we developed a test suite that enables the comparison of the behavior of models of neurons in the rat hippocampus and their evaluation against experimental data. Applying our tests to several models available in the literature, we show that each model is able to capture some of the important properties of the real neuron but fails to match experimental data in other domains. We also use the test suite in the model development workflow of the European Human Brain Project to aid the construction of better models of hippocampal neurons and networks.",

    "abstract": "The present research aims at quantifying the impact of practicing a new coordination pattern with an online visual feedback on the postural coordination performed on a mechanical horse. Forty-four voluntary participants were recruited in this study. They were randomly assigned to four practice groups based on i) with or without feedback (i.e., group 1, control, did not receive the feedback; group 2, 3 and 4 received an online feedback during practice) and ii) the specific trunk/horse coordination to target during practice (group 1, target coordination = 180{degrees} (without feedback); group 2, target coordination = 0{degrees}; group 3, target coordination = 90{degrees}; group 4, target coordination = 180{degrees}). All participants performed pre-, practice, post- and retention sessions. The pre-, post- and retention sessions consisted of four trials, with one trial corresponding to one specific target coordination to maintain between their own oscillations and the horse oscillations (spontaneous, 0{degrees}, 90{degrees}, and 180{degrees}). The practice phase was composed of three different sessions during which participants received an online feedback about the coordination between their own oscillations and the horse oscillations.\n\nResults showed a significant change with practice in the trunk/horse coordination patterns which persisted even after one month (retention-test). However, all the groups did not show the same nature of change, evidenced by a high postural variability during post-test for 0{degrees} and 90{degrees} target coordination groups, in opposition to the 180{degrees} and spontaneous groups who showed a decrease in coordination variability for the 180{degrees} group. The coordination in anti-phase was characterized as spontaneously adopted by participants on the mechanical horse, explaining the ease of performing this coordination (compared to the 0{degrees} and 90{degrees} target coordination). The effect of online visual feedback appeared not only on the coordination pattern itself, but most importantly on its variability during practice, including concerning initially stable coordination patterns.",

Despite this, there are little data on the effect of antimicrobial use (AMU) on disease incidence and mortality rate.\n\nObjectiveWe investigated the relationships between AMU and disease and between AMU and mortality using data from a large (n=322 flocks) cohort of small-scale chicken flocks in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, that were followed longitudinally from day-old to slaughter (5,566 observation weeks).\n\nMethodsWe developed a parameterized algorithm to categorize the observation weeks into  non-AMU,  prophylactic AMU and  therapeutic AMU. To evaluate the prophylactic AMU effect, we compared the frequencies of clinical signs in  non-AMU and  prophylactic AMU periods. To analyse therapeutic AMU, we compared mortality rates between the weeks of disease episodes before and after AMU. Analyses were stratified by clinical signs (4) and antimicrobial classes (13).\n\nResultsProphylactic AMU never reduced the probability of disease, some antimicrobial classes such as lincosamides, amphenicols and penicillins increased the risk. The risk of diarrhoea consistently increased with prophylactic AMU. Therapeutic AMU often had an effect on mortality but the pattern was inconsistent across the combinations of antimicrobial classes and clinical signs with 14/29 decreasing and 11/29 increasing the mortality rate. Lincosamides, methenamines and cephalosporins were the only three antimicrobial classes that always decreased the mortality rate when used therapeutically. Results were robust respective to the parameters values of the weeks categorization algorithm.\n\nConclusionThis information should help support policy efforts and interventions aiming at reducing AMU in animal production.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a medical condition associated with serious medical and psycho-social consequences and an augmented body fat mass. Several compounds were suggested to counteract obesity and fat accumulation with variable degrees of success. Searching for a safe and effective anti-adipogenic substance, we found that cuminaldehyde-rich essential oil extracted from Calligonum comosum potentially mediate activities. The results showed that C. comosum essential oil and its major component cuminaldehyde, selectively caused significant reduction in the viability of 3T3-L1 cells when compared to fibroblasts. Furthermore, cuminaldehyde caused significant reduction in the lipid content, glucose uptake and levels of both triglycerides and cholesterol in adipocytes. Moreover, the formation of 3D-adipocyte pellets in the presence of cuminaldeyde was affected. Adipocytes matured in the presence of cuminaldehyde have significant reduction in the expression of adipocyte-specific transcripts, CAAT-enhancer binding protein alpha (CEBPa) and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg). Taken together, these results demonstrate a potential inhibitory role of cuminaldehyde extracted from C. comosum oil on lipid accumulation. Consequently, cuminaldeyde can be considered as a new potential anti-adipogenic agent for prevention and treatment of obesity.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the conceptual capability of Moistube irrigation to discharge under zero applied positive pressure under varied climatic conditions by inducing an artificial evaporative demand (Ed) or negative pressure around moistube tubing. This was premised on the null hypothesis that an artificially induced Ed or negative pressure does not impact moistube discharge. Moistube tubing was enclosed in a 1 m long PVC conduit. A 20 l water reservoir placed on an electronic balance provided a continuous supply of water whilst a three-speed hot air blower facilitated the radiative factor and advection process. The procedure was conducted under varied climatic conditions of air velocities (ua) 1.2 m.s-1, 2.5 m.s-1, and 3.0 m.s-1 and the experiment run times were 159 h, 134 h and 10 h, respectively. The average temperature (Tave) and relative humidity (RH) data for ua = 1.2 m.s-1 were 53{degrees}C and 7.31%, whilst for ua = 2.5 m.s-1, Tave was 56{degrees}C and RH = 7.19%, and for ua = 3.0 m.s-1, Tave was 63{degrees}C and RH = 6.16%. The experimental data was input into the four variable Penman-Monteith method to compute the evaporative demand (Ed). For each of the air velocities, the respective Ed values obtained were 0.16, 0.31 and 0.36 mm.d-1. The Bowen ratios (r) were well below 1 (r < 1), which suggested a sufficient supply of moisture to evaporate. For Ed = 0.16 mm.d-1 the vapour pressure deficit (VPD) was 113.08 mbars, whilst for Ed = 0.31 mm.d-1 and for Ed = 0.36 mm.d-1 the VPD were 129.93 mbars and 150.14 mbars, respectively. The recorded discharges (q) at t = 10 hrs for Ed= 0.16 mm.d-1 was 7.67*10-3 l.hr-1.m-1, whilst for Ed = 0.31 mm.d-1 q = 14.5*10-3 l.hr-1.m-1, and for Ed = 0.36 mm.d-1 q = 20.8*10-3 l.hr-1.m-1. The imposed negative pressure causes an exponential increase in moistube discharge, thus disproving the null hypothesis. The higher the evaporative demand the higher the discharge. This phenomenon allows moistube irrigation to be used for deficit irrigation purposes and allows irrigators to capitalize on realistic soil matric potential irrigation scheduling approach.",

    "abstract": "The RNA-binding protein CsrA is a post-transcriptional regulator that is encoded in genomes throughout the bacterial phylogeny. In the gamma-proteobacteria, the activity of CsrA is inhibited by small RNAs that competitively sequester CsrA binding. In contrast, the firmicute Bacillus subtilis encodes a protein inhibitor of CsrA called FliW, that non-competitively inhibits CsrA activity but the precise mechanism of antagonism is unclear. Here we take an unbiased genetic approach to identify residues of FliW important for CsrA inhibition that fall into two distinct spatial and functional classes. Most loss-of-function alleles mutated FliW residues that surround the critical regulatory CsrA residue N55 and abolished CsrA interaction. Two loss-of-function alleles however mutated FliW residues near the CsrA core dimerization domain and maintained interaction with CsrA. One of these two alleles reversed charge at what appeared to be a salt bridge with the CsrA core region, charge reversal of the CsrA partner residue phenocopied the FliW allele, and charge reversal of both residues simultaneously restored antagonism. We propose a model in which initial interaction between FliW and CsrA is necessary but not sufficient for antagonism which also requires salt bridge formation with, and deformation of, the CsrA core domain to allosterically abolish RNA binding activity.\n\nSummaryCsrA is a small dimeric protein that binds RNA and is one of the few known examples of transcript-specific translational regulators in bacteria. A protein called FliW binds to and antagonizes CsrA; despite having a high-resolution three-dimensional structure of the FliW-CsrA complex, the mechanism of non-competitive inhibition remains unresolved. Here we identify FliW residues required for antagonism and we find that the residues make a linear connection in the complex from initial binding interaction with CsrA to a critical salt bridge near the core of the CsrA dimer. We propose that the salt bridge represents an allosteric contact that distorts the CsrA core to prevent RNA binding.",

    "abstract": "7 Tesla (7T) magnetic resonance imaging holds great promise for improved visualization of the human brain for clinical purposes. To assess whether 7T is superior regarding localization procedures of small brain structures, we compared manual parcellations of the red nucleus, subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, globus pallidus interna and externa, created on a commonly used clinical anisotropic clinical 3T with an optimized isotropic (o)3T and standard 7T scan. While the clinical 3T MRI scan did not allow delineation of an anatomical plausible structure due to its limited spatial resolution, optimized 3T and 7T parcellations could be directly compared. We found that 7T outperformed the o3T MRI as reflected by higher Dice scores, which were used as a measurement of interrater agreement for manual parcellations on quantitative susceptibility maps. This increase in agreement was associated with higher contrast to noise ratios for smaller structures, but not for the larger globus pallidus segments. Additionally, control-analyses were performed to account for potential biases in manual parcellations by assessing semi-automatic parcellations. These results did not confirm increased Dice scores for 7T, although they revealed a higher consistency for structure volumes for 7T compared to optimized 3T, potentially indicative of more agreement with increased field strength. Together these results indicate the importance of the use of isotropic voxels with both 3T and 7T, and the potential for clinical applications.",

Recent network-based approaches have shown that a phenotypes PPI networks resilience to environmental perturbations is related to its placement in the tree of life; though we still do not know how or why certain intra-cellular factors can bring about this resilience. Here, we explore the influence of gene expression and network properties on PPI networks resilience. We use publicly-available data of PPIs for E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and H. sapiens, where we compute changes in network resilience as new nodes (proteins) are added to the networks under three node addition mechanisms--random, degree-based, and gene-expression-based attachments. By calculating the resilience of the resulting networks, we estimate the effectiveness of these node addition mechanisms. We demonstrate that adding nodes with gene-expression-based preferential attachment (as opposed to random or degree-based) preserves and can increase the original resilience of PPI network in all three species, regardless of gene expression distribution or network structure. These findings introduce a general notion of prospective resilience, which highlights the key role of network structures in understanding the evolvability of phenotypic traits.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARYDNA methylation is implicated in neuronal biology via the protein MeCP2, mutation of which causes Rett syndrome. MeCP2 recruits the NCOR1/2 corepressor complexes to methylated cytosine in the CG dinucleotide, but also to non-CG methylation, which is abundant specifically in neuronal genomes. To test the biological significance of its dual binding specificity, we replaced the MeCP2 DNA binding domain with an orthologous domain whose specificity is restricted to mCG motifs. Knock-in mice expressing the domain-swap protein displayed severe Rett syndrome-like phenotypes, demonstrating that interaction with sites of non-CG methylation, specifically the mCAC trinucleotide, is critical for normal brain function. The results support the notion that the delayed onset of Rett syndrome is due to the late accumulation of both mCAC and its reader MeCP2. Intriguingly, genes dysregulated in both Mecp2-null and domain-swap mice are implicated in other neurological disorders, potentially highlighting targets of particular relevance to the Rett syndrome phenotype.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Trypanosome Lytic Factor (TLF) is a primate-specific high-density lipoprotein complex that contains APOL1, the lytic component. Human TLF confers sterile immunity to many animal-infective extracellular Trypanosoma Ssp, which have been extensively investigated. Here, we have dissected the underappreciated role of TLF and neutrophils against intracellular Leishmania in intradermal infection. Our data show that mice producing human or baboon TLF have reduced parasite burdens when infected intradermally with metacyclic promastigotes of L. major. This TLF-mediated reduction in parasite burden was lost in neutrophil-depleted TLF mice, suggesting that early recruitment of neutrophils is required for TLF-mediated killing of L. major. Neutrophils and macrophages are the predominant phagocytes recruited to the site of infection. Our data show that acidification of the macrophage phagosome is essential for TLF-mediated lysis of metacyclic promastigotes. In vitro we find that only metacyclic promastigotes co-incubated with TLF in an acidic milieu were lysed. However, amastigotes were not killed by TLF at any pH. These findings correlated with binding experiments, revealing that labeled TLF binds specifically to the surface of metacyclic promastigotes, but not to amastigotes. During differentiation to the amastigote stage, the parasites shed their surface glycoconjugates. Metacyclic promastigotes of L. major deficient in the synthesis of surface glycoconjugates (lpg1- and lpg5A-/lpg5B-) were partially resistant to TLF lysis. We propose that TLF binds to the outer surface glycoconjugates of metacyclic promastigotes, whereupon APOL1 forms a pH-gated ion channel in the plasma membrane, resulting in osmotic lysis. We hypothesize that resistance to TLF requires shedding of the surface glycoconjugates, which occurs upon phagocytosis by immune cells.\n\nAuthor SummaryLeishmaniasis is a common term used for disease caused by parasites of the genus Leishmania. Depending on the parasite species and the clinical outcome of the disease, leishmaniasis can be divided into cutaneous, muco-cutaneous and visceral. Of the three, cutaneous leishmaniasis is the most common form, which is usually characterized by a localized lesion due to the infection of immune cells, primarily macrophages of the dermis and local lymph nodes. Sometimes, infected individuals can remain asymptomatic and do not show visible lesions. Moreover, the time between the infection and appearance of lesions are also variable and range from a few weeks to months and a few years in some cases. This subclinical stage of leishmaniasis depends on a variety of factors: parasite virulence, infectious dose, and host immune response. Therefore, it is important to understand the host-parasite interaction and its role in the clinical outcome of the disease. Here, we analyze the interaction between a cutaneous strain of Leishmania and a host innate immune factor called Trypanosome Lytic Factor (TLF). TLF is a type of High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) complex that circulates in our plasma. TLF kills extracellular African Trypanosomes by lysing the parasites. The lytic ability of TLF is due to the primate specific protein APOL1 that forms pH gated ion channels. APOL1 inserts into biological membranes at acidic pH and forms a closed ion-channel that opens when the membrane associated APOL1 is exposed to neutral pH.\n\nUsing transgenic mice producing primate TLF, we show both human and baboon TLFs ameliorate cutaneous Leishmania major infection. The reduction in parasite burden correlated with: 1. infectious dose of metacyclic promastigotes and 2. the concentration of circulating TLF in mouse plasma. The early recruitment of neutrophils at the site of infection was required for the reduction of parasite burden by TLF. Macrophages, another major cell that phagocytoses metacyclic promastigotes at the site of infection require an acidified phagosome for TLF mediated killing of L. major. The acidification step is also essential for TLF mediated lysis of axenic metacyclic promastigotes of Leishmania in vitro. The susceptibility of metacyclic promastigotes to TLF mediated lysis is governed by the surface glycoconjugates of Leishmania. We find that surface glycoconjugate deficient Leishmania are resistant to TLF mediated killing. Based on these data, we conclude that the shedding of surface glycoconjugates while transitioning from metacyclic promastigotes to amastigotes results in parasite resistance to TLF mediated lysis. Whether TLF is effective at killing metacyclic promastigotes of other experimentally tractable Leishmania sp. such as L. infantum, and L. donovani, which have slightly different surface glycoconjugate structures is yet to be tested. Our data raise the possibility that TLF can have lytic activity against a broad range of pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites with surface glycoconjugates that transit through intracellular acidic compartments.",

    "abstract": "SummaryThe HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer is decorated with N-linked glycans, which are attached to asparagine residues in the amino acid sequon NxT/S by oligosaccharyltransferases (OST). Artificial glycan \u201choles\u201d exist when a PNGS is under-occupied on recombinant Env-based vaccines, but not on their viral counterpart. Native-like SOSIP trimers, including clinical candidates, have these artificial holes in the glycan shield that induce strain-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) or non-NAbs. To increase PNGS occupancy, eliminate artificial glycan holes, and mimic the glycosylation of native BG505 Env, we replaced all 12 NxS sequons on the BG505 SOSIP trimer with NxT, thereby increasing the affinity of the sequons for OST. All PNGS, except N133 and N160, were nearly fully occupied on the modified trimer. Occupancy of the N133 site could be increased by changing N133 to NxS, while occupancy of the N160 site could be restored by reverting the nearby N156 sequon to NxS. Hence, OST affinity can influence glycan occupancy when two PNGS are in close proximity. Increasing glycan occupancy should reduce off-target immune responses to artificial glycan holes on vaccine antigens.Competing Interest StatementR. W. S. and J. P. M. are listed on patents concerning stabilized Env trimers.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Malaria is responsible for half a million deaths annually and poses a huge economic burden on the developing world. The mosquito-borne parasites (Plasmodium spp.) that cause the disease depend upon an unconventional actomyosin motor for both gliding motility and host cell invasion. The motor system, often referred to as the glideosome complex, remains to be understood in molecular terms and is an attractive target for new drugs that might block the infection pathway. Here, we present the first high-resolution structure of the actomyosin motor complex from Plasmodium falciparum. Our structure includes the malaria parasite actin filament (PfAct1) complexed with the myosin motor (PfMyoA) and its two associated light-chains. The high-resolution core structure reveals the PfAct1:PfMyoA interface in atomic detail, while at lower-resolution, we visualize the PfMyoA light-chain binding region, including the essential light chain (PfELC) and the myosin tail interacting protein (PfMTIP). Finally, we report a bare PfAct1 filament structure at an improved resolution, which gives new information about the nucleotide-binding site, including the orientation of the ATP/ADP sensor, Ser15, and the presence of a channel, which we propose as a possible phosphate exit path after ATP hydrolysis.Significance statement We present the first structure of the malaria parasite motor complex; actin 1 (PfAct1) and myosin A (PfMyoA) with its two light chains. We also report a high-resolution structure of filamentous PfAct1 that reveals new atomic details of the ATPase site, including a channel, which may provide an exit route for phosphate and explain why phosphate release is faster in PfAct1 compared to canonical actins. PfAct1 goes through no conformational changes upon PfMyoA binding. Our PfMyoA structure also superimposes with a recent crystal structure of PfMyoA alone, though there are small but important conformational changes at the interface. Our structures serve as an excellent starting point for drug design against malaria, which is one of the most devastating infectious diseases.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Activated Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin (ERM) proteins link the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton to generate apical structures, including microvilli. Among many kinases implicated in ERM activation are the homologs LOK and SLK. CRISPR/Cas9 was used to knockout all ERM proteins or LOK/SLK in human cells. LOK/SLK knockout eliminates all ERM activating phosphorylation. The apical domain of cells lacking LOK/SLK or ERMs is strikingly similar and selectively altered, with loss of microvill, and junctional actin replaced by ectopic myosin-II containing apical stress-fiber-like structures. Constitutively active ezrin can reverse the phenotypes of either ERMs or LOK/SLK knockouts, showing that the major function of LOK/SLK is to activate ERMs. Both knockout lines have elevated active RhoA with concomitant enhanced myosin light chain phosphorylation, revealing that active ERMs are negative regulators of RhoA. As RhoA-GTP activates LOK/SLK to activate ERM proteins, the ability of active ERMs to negatively regulate RhoA-GTP represents a novel local feedback loop necessary for the proper apical morphology of epithelial cells.",

    "abstract": "Bacillus cereus is recognized as a causative agent of gastrointestinal syndromes, but can also cause a devastating form of intraocular infection known as endophthalmitis. We have previously reported that the PlcR/PapR master virulence factor regulator system regulates intraocular virulence, and that the S-layer protein (SlpA) contributes to the severity of B. cereus endophthalmitis. To begin to better understand the role of other B. cereus virulence genes in endophthalmitis, expression levels of a subset of factors was measured at the midpoint of disease progression in a murine model of experimental endophthalmitis by RNA-Seq. Several cytolytic toxins were expressed at significantly higher levels in vivo than in BHI. The virulence regulators codY, gntR, and nprR were also expressed in vivo. However, at this timepoint, plcR/papR was not detectable, we previously reported that a B. cereus mutant deficient in PlcR was attenuated in the eye. The motility-related genes fla, fliF, and motB, and the chemotaxis-related gene cheA were detected during infection. We have shown previously that motility and chemotaxis phenotypes are important in B. cereus endophthalmitis. The sodA2 variant of manganese superoxide dismutase was the most highly expression gene in vivo, suggesting that this gene is criticial for intraocular survival, potentially through inhibition of neutrophil activity. Expression of the surface layer protein gene, slpA, an activator of Toll-like receptors (TLR) -2 and -4, and a potent contributor to intraocular inflammation and disease severvity, was also detected during infection, albeit at low levels. In summary, genes expressed in a mouse model of Bacillus endophthalmitis might prove to play crucial roles in the unique virulence of B. cereus endophthalmitis, and serve as candidates for novel therapies designed attenuate the severity of this often blinding infection.\n\nImpact statementB. cereus causes a potent and rapid infection of the eye that usually results in blindness or enucleation, even with the utilization of current treatment modalities. This necessitates the development of new treatment modalities based on new targets. To begin to better define those B. cereus factors with roles in intraocular infection, we analyzed the expression of genes with both known and hypothesized roles in intraocular infection at the midpoint of infection using a murine model of Bacillus endophthalmitis. Potentially targetable candidate genes were demonstrated to be expressed in vivo, which suggests that these genes might contribute to the unique virulence of B. cereus endophthalmitis. Importantly, our results begin to define the virulome of B. cereus in intraocular infections and identify previously uncharacterized factors with potential roles in the severity and outcome of Bacillus endophthalmitis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDespite the marked inter-individual variability in the clinical presentation of schizophrenia, it remains unclear the extent to which individual dimensions of psychopathology may be reflected in variability across the collective set of functional brain connections. Here, we address this question using network-based predictive modeling of individual psychopathology along four data-driven symptom dimensions. Follow-up analyses assess the molecular underpinnings of predictive networks by relating them to neurotransmitter-receptor distribution patterns.\n\nMethodsWe investigated resting-state fMRI data from 147 schizophrenia patients recruited at seven sites. Individual expression along negative, positive, affective, and cognitive symptom dimensions was predicted using relevance vector machine based on functional connectivity within 17 meta-analytic task-networks following a repeated 10-fold cross-validation and leave-one-site-out analyses. Results were validated in an independent sample. Networks robustly predicting individual symptom dimensions were spatially correlated with density maps of nine receptors/transporters from prior molecular imaging in healthy populations.\n\nResultsTen-fold and leave-one-site-out analyses revealed five predictive network-symptom associations. Connectivity within theory-of-mind, cognitive reappraisal, and mirror neuron networks predicted negative, positive, and affective symptom dimensions, respectively. Cognitive dimension was predicted by theory-of-mind and socio-affective-default networks. Importantly, these predictions generalized to the independent sample. Intriguingly, these two networks were positively associated with D1 dopamine receptor and serotonin reuptake transporter densities as well as dopamine-synthesis-capacity.\n\nConclusionsWe revealed a robust association between intrinsic functional connectivity within networks for socio-affective processes and the cognitive dimension of psychopathology. By investigating the molecular architecture, the present work links dopaminergic and serotonergic systems with the functional topography of brain networks underlying cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Oxygen field evaluation is important in modeling and simulation of many important physiological processes of animals, such as angiogenesis. However, numerical simulation of the oxygen field in animal tissue is usually limited by the unusual coupling of different mechanisms, the nonlinearity of the model, and the complex geometry of refined blood vessel networks. In this work, a fast numerical method is designed for the simulation of oxygen supply in tissue with a large-scale complex vessel network. This method employs an implicit finite-difference scheme to compute the oxygen field. By virtue of an oxygen source distribution technique from vessel center lines to mesh points and a corresponding post-processing technique that eliminate the local numerical error induced by source distribution, square mesh with relatively large mesh sizes can be applied while sufficient numerical accuracy is maintained. The new method has computational complexity which is slightly higher than linear with respect to the number of mesh points and has a convergence order which is slightly lower than second order with respect to the mesh size. As an example, the oxygen field of a tissue irrigated by a blood vessel network with more than four thousand blood vessels can be accurately computed within one minute with our new method. The new method will definitely promote further researches based on evaluation of oxygen field, such as modeling of angiogenesis and pathogenesis of many cardiovascular diseases.",
