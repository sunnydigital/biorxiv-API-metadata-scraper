Manual methods to quantify climbing performance are slow, tedious, and may be systematically biased, while available computational methods have inflexible hardware or software requirements. We present an alternative: FreeClimber. This open source, Python-based pipeline subtracts a video\u2019s static background to improve spot detection for moving flies in heterogeneous backgrounds. FreeClimber calculates a cohort\u2019s velocity as the slope of the most linear portion of a mean-vertical position vs. time plot. It can run from a graphical user interface for parameter optimization or a command line interface for high-throughput and automated batch processing. It outputs calculated slopes, spot locations for follow up analyses such as tracking, and several visualizations and diagnostic plots. We demonstrate FreeClimber\u2019s utility in a longitudinal study for endurance exercise performance in Drosophila using six distinct mitochondrial haplotypes paired with a common w1118 nuclear background.Summary statement FreeClimber quantifies the climbing velocity for a group of flies, eliminating systematic biases associated with traditional manual methods in a high throughput and automated (graphical and/or command line-based) platform.List of Symbols and AbbreviationsecceccentricityGUIGraphical User Interfacemito-nuclearMitochondrial-nuclearmitotypesMitochondrial haplotypeOreROregon RROIRegion of InterestyakyakubaZimZimbabwe53View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The seven-transmembrane G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) relays short-term non-genomic responses in target cells and tissues. It is a proposed tumor suppressor, which frequently undergoes down-modulation in primary tumors of the breast, ovary, and endometrium. A study by Liu and co-workers reported the loss of GPER expression in colorectal cancer and attributed it to DNA methylation-dependent silencing. The present study is based on the hypothesis that GPER expression is inversely correlated with methylation in the upstream CpG island (upCpGi) in the GPER locus. Methylation in the upCpGi was analysed by bisulfite sequencing and correlated with GPER expression in a panel of colon cancer cell lines The bisulfite sequencing results show the presence of a differentially methylated region (DMR) comprising of the downstream eight CpGs of the upCpGi. Methylation in the DMR correlated inversely with GPER expression. We compared two cell lines, namely SW620 and COLO-320DM, in terms of their viability in response to varying concentrations of G1, a GPER specific agonist, which is known to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in colon cancer cell lines. SW-620 cells, which had the least methylated DMR and the highest level of GPER expression, showed significant loss of viability with 1 \u03bcM G1. On the other hand, COLO-320DM, which had the most methylated DMR and the lowest level of GPER expression, did not show a significant response to 1 \u03bcM G1. At 5 \u03bcM G1, SW620 cells showed a greater reduction in viability than COLO-320DM cells. Our study demonstrates the inverse correlation between DNA methylation in the DMR and GPER expression. GPER is a non-canonical form of estrogen receptor, and estrogen is believed to exert its oncoprotective effect in the colon via GPER. DNA methylation-dependent silencing of GPER may, at least in part, the underlying reason behind the loss of estrogen\u2019s oncoprotective effect in the colon. Future studies should explore the utility of DNA methylation in the upCpGi, particularly the DMR, in diagnosis or prognosis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a type III intermediate filament (IF) protein that is highly expressed in astrocytes, neural stem cells, and in gliomas. Gliomas are a heterogeneous group of primary brain tumors that arise from glia cells or neural stem cells and rely on accurate diagnosis for prognosis and treatment strategies. GFAP is differentially expressed between glioma subtypes and therefore often used as a diagnostic marker. However, GFAP is highly regulated by the process of alternative splicing; many different isoforms have been identified. Differential expression of GFAP isoforms between glioma subtypes suggests that GFAP isoform-specific analyses could benefit diagnostics. In this study we report on the differential expression of a new GFAP isoform between glioma subtypes, GFAP\u03bc. A short GFAP transcript resulting from GFAP exon 2 skipping was detected by RNA sequencing of human glioma. We show that GFAP\u03bc mRNA is expressed in healthy brain tissue, glioma cell lines, and primary glioma cells and that it translates into a ~21 kDa GFAP protein. 21 kDa GFAP protein was detected in the IF protein fraction isolated from human spinal cord as well. We further show that induced GFAP\u03bc expression disrupts the GFAP IF network. The characterization of this new GFAP isoform adds on to the numerous previously identified GFAP splice isoforms. It emphasizes the importance of studying the contribution of IF splice variants to specialized functions of the IF network and to glioma diagnostics.Summary statement RNA sequencing data of glioma patient material reveals the differential expression of a short GFAP splice isoform, GFAP\u03bc, between glioma subtypes. GFAP\u03bc translates into a 21 kDa N-terminal GFAP protein which can disrupt the GFAP intermediate filament network.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "To understand the mechanisms of information coding in single neurons, it is necessary to analyze subthreshold synaptic events, action potentials (APs), and the interrelation between these two forms of activity in different behavioral states. However, detecting excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) or currents (EPSCs) in awake, behaving animals remains challenging, because of unfavorable signal-to-noise ratio, high frequency, fluctuating amplitude, and variable time course of synaptic events. Here, we developed a new method for synaptic event detection, termed MOD (Machine-learning Optimal-filtering Detection-procedure), which combines concepts of supervised machine learning and optimal Wiener filtering. First, experts were asked to manually score short epochs of data. Second, the algorithm was trained to obtain the optimal filter coefficients of a Wiener filter and the optimal detection threshold. Third, scored and unscored data were processed with the optimal filter, and events were detected as peaks above threshold. Finally, the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was used to quantify accuracy and efficiency of detection. Additionally, cross-validation was performed to exclude overfitting of the scored data, a potential concern with machine-learning approaches. We then challenged the new detection method with EPSP traces in vivo in mice during spatial navigation and EPSC traces in vitro in slices under conditions of enhanced transmitter release. When benchmarked using a (1-AUC)-1 metric, MOD outperformed previous methods (template-fit and deconvolution) by a factor of up to 3. Thus, MOD may become an important tool for large-scale analysis of synaptic activity in vivo and in vitro.\n\nHighlightsO_LIA new method for detection of synaptic events, termed MOD, is described\nC_LIO_LIThe method combines the concepts of supervised machine learning and optimal filtering\nC_LIO_LIThe method is useful for analysis of both in vitro and in vivo data sets\nC_LIO_LIMOD outperforms previously published methods for synaptic event detection by a factor of up to 3\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "While many tissues fold in vivo in a highly reproducible and robust way, epithelial folds remain difficult to reproduce in vitro, so that the effects and underlying mechanisms of local curvature on the epithelial tissue remains unclear. Here, we photoreticulated polyacrylamide hydrogels though an optical photomask to create corrugated hydrogels with isotropic wavy patterns, allowed us to show that concave and convex curvatures affect cellular and nuclear shape. By culturing MDCK epithelial cells at confluency on corrugated hydrogels, we showed that the substrate curvature leads to thicker epithelial zones in the valleys and thinner ones on the crest, as well as corresponding density, which can be generically explained by a simple 2D vertex model, leading us to hypothesize that curvature sensing could arise from resulting density/thickness changes. Additionally, positive and negative local curvatures lead to significant modulations of the nuclear morphology and positioning, which can also be well-explained by an extension of vertex models taking into account membrane-nucleus interactions, where thickness/density modulation generically translate into the corresponding changes in nuclear aspect ratio and position, as seen in the data. Consequently, we find that the spatial distribution of Yes associated proteins (YAP), the main transcriptional effector of the Hippo signaling pathway, is modulated in folded epithelial tissues according to the resulting thickness modulation, an effect that disappears at high cell density. Finally, we showed that these deformations are also associated with changes of A-type and B-type lamin expression, significant chromatin condensation and to lower cell proliferation rate. These findings show that active cell mechanics and nuclear mechanoadaptation are key players of the mechanistic regulation of epithelial monolayers to substrate curvature, with potential application for a number of in vivo situations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Autophagy induction involves extensive molecular and membrane reorganization. Despite significant progress, the mechanism underlying autophagy initiation remains poorly understood. Here, we used quantitative Photoactivated Localization Microscopy with single-molecule sensitivity to analyze the nanoscopic distribution of endogenous ULK1, the kinase that triggers autophagy. Under amino acid starvation, ULK1 formed large clusters containing up to 161 molecules at the endoplasmic reticulum. Cross-correlation analysis revealed that ULK1 clusters engaging in autophagosome formation require 30 or more molecules. The ULK1 structures with more than the threshold number contained varying levels of Atg13, Atg14, Atg16, LC3B, GEC1 and WIPI2. We found that ULK1 activity is dispensable for the initial clustering of ULK1, but necessary for the subsequent expansion of the clusters, which involves interaction with Atg14, Atg16, and LC3B and relies on Vps34 activity. This quantitative analysis at the single molecule level has provided unprecedented insights into the behavior of ULK1 during autophagy initiation.",

Although highly heritable, risk for this polygenic disorder depends on the complex interplay of hundreds of common and rare variants. Translating the growing list of genetic loci significantly associated with disease into medically actionable information remains an important challenge. Thus, establishing platforms with which to validate the impact of risk variants in cell-type-specific and donor-dependent contexts is critical. Towards this, we selected and characterize a collection of twelve human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines derived from control donors with extremely low and high SZ polygenic risk scores (PRS). These hiPSC lines are publicly available at the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM). The suitability of these extreme PRS hiPSCs for CRISPR-based isogenic comparisons of neurons and glia was evaluated across three independent laboratories, identifying 9 out of 12 meeting our criteria. We report a standardized resource of publicly available hiPSCs, with which we collectively commit to conducting future CRISPR-engineering, in order to facilitate comparison and integration of functional validation studies across the field of psychiatric genetics.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Information is coded in the brain at different scales for different phenomena: locally, distributed across regions and networks, and globally. For pain, the scale of representation is controversial. Although generally believed to be an integrated cognitive and sensory phenomenon implicating diverse brain systems, quantitative characterizations of which regions and networks are sufficient to represent pain are lacking. In this meta-analysis (or mega-analysis) using data from 289 participants across 10 studies, we use model comparison combined with multivariate predictive models to investigate the spatial scale and location of acute pain representation. We compare models based on (a) a single most pain-predictive module, either previously identified elementary regions or a single best large-scale cortical resting-state network module; (b) selected cortical-subcortical systems related to evoked pain in prior literature ( multi-system models); and (c) a model spanning the full brain. We estimate the accuracy of pain intensity predictions using cross validation (7 studies) and subsequently validate in three independent holdout studies. All spatial scales convey information about pain intensity, but distributed, multi-system models better characterize pain representations than any individual region or network (e.g. multisystem models explain >20% more of individual subject pain ratings than the best elementary region). Full brain models showed no predictive advantage over multi-system models. These findings quantify the extent that representation of evoked pain experience is distributed across multiple cortical and subcortical systems, show that pain representation is not circumscribed by any elementary region or conical network, and provide a blueprint for identifying the spatial scale of information in other domains.\n\nSignificance StatementWe define modular, multisystem and global views of brain function, use multivariate fMRI decoding to characterize pain representations at each level, and provide evidence for a multisystem representation of evoked pain. We further show that local views necessarily exclude important components of pain representation, while a global full brain representation is superfluous, even though both are viable frameworks for representing pain. These findings quantitatively juxtapose and reconcile divergent conclusions from evoked pain studies within a generalized neuroscientific framework, and provide a blueprint for investigating representational architecture for diverse brain processes.",

Here we show the influence of gender, parenthood and race in academics productivity during the pandemic period, based on a survey answered by 3,345 Brazilian academics from various knowledge areas and research institutions. Findings revealed that male academics - especially childless ones - were the least affected group, whereas female academics, especially Black women and mothers, were the most impacted group. This scenario will leave long-term effects on the career progression of the most affected groups. The results presented here are crucial for the development of actions and policies that aim to avoid further deepening the gender gap in science. This particular situation we are facing during the pandemic demands institutional flexibility and academia should foster the discussion about actions to benefit Black scientists and academics with families in the post-pandemic scenario.",

Here we show that D614G was more infectious than the ancestral form on human lung cells, colon cells, and cells rendered permissive by ectopic expression of various mammalian ACE2 orthologs. Nonetheless, D614G affinity for ACE2 was reduced due to a faster dissociation rate. Assessment of the S protein trimer by cryo-electron microscopy showed that D614G disrupts a critical interprotomer contact and that this dramatically shifts the S protein trimer conformation toward an ACE2-binding and fusion-competent state. Consistent with the more open conformation, neutralization potency of antibodies targeting the S protein receptor-binding domain was not attenuated. These results indicate that D614G adopts conformations that make virion membrane fusion with the target cell membrane more probable but that D614G retains susceptibility to therapies that disrupt interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein with the ACE2 receptor.",

    "abstract": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal lung disease characterized by progressive and excessive accumulation of myofibroblasts and extracellular matrix in the lung. Connective-tissue growth factor (CTGF) is known to exacerbate pulmonary fibrosis in radiation-induced lung fibrosis, and in this study, we show the upregulation of CTGF from a rat lung fibrosis model induced by adenovirus vector encoding active TGF-\u03b21 (AdTGF-\u03b21), and also in patients with IPF. The expression of CTGF was upregulated in vascular smooth muscle cells cultured from fibrotic lungs on days 7 or 14 as well as endothelial cells sorted from fibrotic lungs on day 14 or 28 respectively. These findings suggest the role of different cells in maintaining the fibrotic phenotype during fibrogenesis. Treatment of fibroblasts with recombinant CTGF along with TGF-\u03b2 increases pro-fibrotic markers in fibroblasts, confirming the synergistic effect of recombinant CTGF with TGF-\u03b2 in inducing pulmonary fibrosis. Also, fibrotic extracellular matrix upregulated the expression of CTGF, as compared to normal extracellular matrix, suggesting that not only profibrotic mediators but also a profibrotic environment contributes to fibrogenesis. We also showed that pamrevlumab, a CTGF inhibitory antibody, partially attenuates fibrosis in the model. These results suggest that pamrevlumab could be an option for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.Competing Interest StatementT.

    "abstract": "The evolution of sex chromosomes in the XY or ZW systems shall lead to gene expression dosage problems, as in at least one of the sexes, the sex-linked gene dose has been reduced by half. It has been proposed, most notably by Susumu Ohno for mammals, that the transcriptional output of the whole sex chromosome should be doubled for a complete dosage compensation. However, due to the variability of the existing methods to determine the transcriptional differences between Sex chromosomes and Autosomes (S:A ratios) in different studies, whether clade-specific results are comparable and whether there is a more general model to explain dosage compensation states remain unanswered. In this study, we collected more than 500 public RNA-seq datasets from multiple tissues and species in major clades (including mammals, birds, fishes, insects, and worms) and proposed a unified computational framework for unbiased and comparable measurement of the S:A ratios of multiple species. We also tested the evolution of dosage compensation more directly by assessing changes in the expression levels of the current sex-linked genes relative to those of the ancestral sex-linked genes. We found that in mammals and birds, the S:A ratio is approximately 0.5, while in insects, fishes and flatworms, the S:A ratio is approximately 1. Further analysis showed that the fraction of dosage-sensitive housekeeping genes on the sex chromosome is significantly correlated with the S:A ratio. In addition, the degree of degradation of the Y chromosome may be responsible for the change in the S:A ratio in mammals without a dosage-compensation mechanism. Our observations offer unequivocal support for the sex chromosome insensitivity hypothesis in animals and suggest that the dosage sensitivity states of sex chromosomes is a major factor underlying different evolutionary strategies of dosage compensation.",

    "abstract": "DNA replication in eukaryotic cells initiates from chromosomal locations, called replication origins, that bind the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) prior to S phase. Origin establishment is guided by well-defined DNA sequence motifs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and some other budding yeasts, but most eukaryotes lack sequence-specific origins. At present, the mechanistic and evolutionary reasons for this difference are unclear. A 3.9 \u00c5 structure of S. cerevisiae ORC-Cdc6-Cdt1-Mcm2-7 (OCCM) bound to origin DNA revealed, among other things, that a loop within Orc2 inserts into a DNA minor groove and an \u03b1-helix within Orc4 inserts into a DNA major groove1. We show that this Orc4 \u03b1-helix mediates the sequence-specificity of origins in S. cerevisiae. Specifically, mutations were identified within this \u03b1-helix that alter the sequence-dependent activity of individual origins as well as change global genomic origin firing patterns. This was accomplished using a massively parallel origin selection assay analyzed using a custom mutual-information-based modeling approach and a separate analysis of whole-genome replication profiling and statistics. Interestingly, the sequence specificity of DNA replication initiation, as mediated by the Orc4 \u03b1-helix, has evolved in close conjunction with the gain of ORC-Sir4-mediated gene silencing and the loss of RNA interference.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a gain-of-function protein with toxic activities, containing an expanded polyQ tract in the coding region. Actually, there are no treatments available to delay the onset, stop or slow down the progression of this pathology. Many approaches developed over the years involve the use of siRNAs and antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). Here we develop and validate a CRISPR/Cas9 therapeutic strategy in fibroblasts isolated from SCA1 patients. We started from the screening of 10 different sgRNAs able to recognize regions upstream and downstream the CAG repeats, in exon 8 of ATXN1 gene. The two most promising sgRNAs, G3 and G8, whose efficiency was evaluated with an in vitro system, significantly downregulated the ATXN 1 protein expression. This downregulation was due to the introduction of indels mutations into the ATXN1 gene. Notably, with an RNA-seq analysis, we demonstrated minimal off-target effects of our sgRNAs. These preliminary results support CRISPR/Cas9 as a promising approach for treated polyQ-expanded diseases.",

    "abstract": "Perceiving the temporal regularity in a sequence of repetitive sensory events facilitates the preparation and execution of relevant behaviors with tight temporal constraints. How we estimate temporal regularity from repeating patterns of sensory stimuli is not completely understood. We developed a decision-making task in which participants had to decide whether a train of visual, auditory, or tactile pulses, had a regular or an irregular temporal pattern. We tested the hypothesis that subjects categorize stimuli as irregular by accumulating the time differences between the predicted and observed times of sensory pulses defining a temporal rhythm. Results show that instead of waiting for a single large temporal deviation, participants accumulate timing-error signals and judge a pattern as irregular when the amount of evidence reaches a decision threshold. Model fits of bounded integration showed that this accumulation occurs with negligible leak of evidence. Consistent with previous findings, we show that participants perform better when evaluating the regularity of auditory pulses, as compared with visual or tactile stimuli. Our results suggest that temporal regularity is estimated by comparing expected and measured pulse onset times, and that each prediction error is accumulated towards a threshold to generate a behavioral choice.",

    "abstract": "The Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin by sequencing (ATAC-seq) is becoming increasingly popular in the neuroscience field where chromatin regulation is thought to be involved in neurodevelopment, activity-dependent gene regulation, hormonal and environmental responses, and the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. The advantages of using this assay include a small amount of material needed, relatively simple and fast protocol, and the ability to capture a range of gene regulatory elements with a single assay. However, with increasing interest in chromatin research, it is an imperative to have feasible, reliable assays that are compatible with a range of neuroscience study designs in both animals and humans. Here we tested three different protocols for neuronal chromatin accessibility analysis, including a varying brain tissue freezing method followed by fluorescent-activated nuclei sorting (FANS) and the ATAC-seq analysis. Our study shows that the cryopreservation method impacts the number of open chromatin regions that can be identified from frozen brain tissue using the cell-type specific ATAC-seq assay. However, we show that all three protocols generate consistent and robust data and enable the identification of functional regulatory elements, promoters and enhancers, in neuronal cells. Our study also implies that the broad biological interpretation of chromatin accessibility data is not significantly affected by the freezing condition. In comparison to the mouse brain analysis, we reveal the additional challenges of doing chromatin analysis on post mortem human brain tissue. However, we also show that these studies are revealing important cell type-specific information about gene regulation in the human brain. Overall, the ATAC-seq coupled with FANS is a powerful method to capture cell-type specific chromatin accessibility information in the mouse and human brain. Our study provides alternative brain preservation methods that generate high quality ATAC-seq data while fitting in different study designs, and further encourages the use of this method to uncover the role of epigenetic (dys)regulation in healthy and malfunctioning brain.",

    "abstract": "In a high-speed single-molecule experiment, a protein is tethered between two substrates that are manipulated to exert force on the system. To avoid nonspecific interactions between the protein and nearby substrates, the protein is usually attached to the substrates through long, flexible linkers. This approach precludes measurements of mechanical properties with high spatial and temporal resolution, for rapidly exerted forces are dissipated into the linkers. Because mammalian hearing operates at frequencies reaching tens to hundreds of kilohertz, the mechanical processes that occur during transduction are of very short duration. Single-molecule experiments on the relevant proteins therefore cannot involve long tethers. We previously characterized the mechanical properties of protocadherin 15 (PCDH15), a protein essential for human hearing, by tethering an individual monomer through very short linkers between a probe bead held in an optical trap and a pedestal bead immobilized on a glass coverslip. Because the two confining surfaces were separated by only the length of the tethered protein, hydrodynamic coupling between those surfaces complicated the interpretation of the data. To facilitate our experiments, we characterize here the anisotropic and position-dependent diffusion coefficient of a probe in the presence of an effectively infinite wall, the coverslip, and of the immobile pedestal.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "In the study of molecular features like epigenetic marks, it is appealing to ascribe observed patterns to the action of natural selection. However, this conclusion requires a test for selection based on a well-defined notion of neutrality. Here, focusing on epigenetic marks at gene loci, we formalize what it means for an epigenetic mark to be neutral, and develop a test for selection. Our test respects the foundational aspect of epigenetics: trans-regulation by transcription factors and chromatin modifiers. It also enables adjustment for confounders. We establish that promoter DNA methylation, promoter H3K4me3 and exonic H3K36me3 are all under selection, and that this is unlikely to be a passive consequence of selection on gene expression. The effect of these epigenetic marks on fitness is arguably partly explained by a causal involvement in gene regulation. However, we also investigate the complementary explanation that DNA methylation and H3K36me3 are under selection in part because they modify the mutation rate of important genomic regions. We show that this explanation is consistent with empirical observations as well as population genetics theory, because of the trans-regulation. Exemplifying the protection of important regions from high mutability, we demonstrate that in humans the more intolerant to loss-of-function mutations a gene is, the lower its coding mutation rate is. Our framework for selection inference is simple but general, and we speculate that its core ideas will be useful for additional molecular features beyond epigenetic marks.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. The treatment of lung cancer patients harboring mutant EGFR with orally administered EGFR TKIs has been a paradigm shift. Osimertinib and rociletinib are 3rd generation irreversible EGFR TKIs targeting the EGFR T790M mutation. Osimertinib is the current standard care for patients with EGFR mutations due to increased efficacy, lower side effects, and enhanced brain penetrance. Unfortunately, all patients develop resistance. Genomic approaches have primarily been used to interrogate resistance mechanisms. Here, we have characterized the proteome and phosphoproteome of a series of isogenic EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma cell lines that are either sensitive or resistant to these drugs. To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive proteomic dataset resource to date to investigate 3rd generation EGFR TKI resistance in lung adenocarcinoma. We have interrogated this unbiased global quantitative mass spectrometry dataset to uncover alterations in signaling pathways, reveal a proteomic signature of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and identify kinases and phosphatases with altered expression and phosphorylation in TKI resistant cells. Decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of key sites in the phosphatase SHP2 suggests its inhibition resulting in inhibition of RAS/MAPK and activation of PI3K/AKT pathways. Furthermore, we performed anticorrelation analyses of this phosphoproteomic dataset with the published drug-induced P100 phosphoproteomic datasets from the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program to predict drugs with the potential to overcome EGFR TKI resistance. We identified dactolisib, a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, which in combination with osimertinib overcomes resistance both in vitro and in vivo.One Sentence Summary Global quantitative proteome and phosphoproteome analyses to examine altered signaling pathways in isogenic 3rd generation EGFR TKI sensitive and resistant cells.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Each approach used to synchronise cell cycle progression of human cell lines presents a unique set of challenges. Induction synchrony with agents that transiently block progression through key cell cycle stages are popular, but change stoichiometries of cell cycle regulators, invoke compensatory changes in growth rate and, for DNA replication inhibitors, damage DNA. The production, replacement, or manipulation of a target molecule must be exceptionally rapid if the interpretation of phenotypes in the cycle under study are to remain independent of impacts upon progression through the preceding cycle. We show how these challenges are avoided by exploiting the ability of the Cdk4/6 inhibitors, palbociclib, ribociclib and abemaciclib to arrest cell cycle progression at the natural control point for cell cycle commitment: the restriction point. After previous work found no change in the coupling of growth and division during recovery from CDK4/6 inhibition, we find high degrees of synchrony in cell cycle progression. Although we validate CDK4/6 induction synchronisation with hTERT-RPE-1, THP1 and H1299, it is effective in other lines and avoids the DNA damage that accompanies synchronisation by thymidine block/release. Competence to return to cycle after 72 hours arrest enables out of cycle target induction/manipulation, without impacting upon preceding cycles.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The human brain has undergone rapid expansion since humans diverged from other great apes, but the mechanism of this human-specific enlargement is still unknown. Here, we use cerebral organoids derived from human, gorilla and chimpanzee cells to study developmental mechanisms driving evolutionary brain expansion. We find that the differentiation of neuroepithelial cells to neurogenic radial glia is a protracted process in apes, involving a previously unrecognized transition state characterized by a change in cell shape. Furthermore, we show that human organoids are larger due to a delay in this transition. Temporally resolved RNA-seq from human and gorilla organoids reveals differences in gene expression patterns associated with cell morphogenesis, and in particular highlights ZEB2, a known regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cell shape. We show, through loss- and gain-of-function experiments, that ZEB2 promotes the progression of neuroepithelial differentiation, and its ectopic overexpression in human is sufficient to trigger a premature transition. Thus, by mimicking the nonhuman ape expression in human organoids, we are able to force the acquisition of nonhuman ape architecture, establishing for the first time, an instructive role of neuroepithelial cell shape in human brain expansion.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTBackground Nicotine biosynthesis is mainly regulated by jasmonate (JA) signaling cascade in Nicotiana tabacum. As an allotetraploid species, the regulation of nicotine biosynthesis has been genetically verified via two unlinked NIC loci (named as NIC1 and NIC2) which are possibly originated from its two ancestral diploids. Previously, a N. tomentosiformis originated ethylene response factor (ERF) gene cluster was identified as the NIC2-locus which has been demonstrated positively regulates nicotine accumulation in N. tabacum.Results Here, we describe the genetic mapping of NIC1-locus, the major nicotine regulatory locus, by using a NIC1-locus segregating population through bulked segregant analysis. We identified two linkage marker TM23004 and TM22038 were delimited the NIC1-locus within a ~34.3-Mb genomic region at pseudochromosome 07 of tobacco genome. Genomic scan within this region revealed a NIC2-like locus ERF gene cluster exist in. To verify this ERF gene cluster is the genetically called \u201cNIC1-locus\u201d, different functional experiments based on most of the ERFs in regulating nicotine biosynthesis and their influences on alkaloid accumulations have been carried out. Collinearity analysis showed that NIC1-locus ERF genes are originated from N. sylvestris and exclusively expressed in root tissues. In addition, transcriptomic results indicate that NIC1-locus ERF genes are coexpressed with the NIC2-locus ERF genes and other nicotine biosynthetic genes and regulators after JA induction. Furthermore, the suppressed expression of four ERFs of the NIC1-locus genes corresponding with decreased NtPMT and NtQPT expression in NtMYC2-RNAi lines indicates the selected NIC1-locus ERFs function in downstream of NtMYC2 in the JA signaling cascades. In the meanwhile, the alkaloid levels are also determined by the amplitude of the four ERF gene expressions in both wild type and LA mutant. Additionally, in vitro binding assays, transient activation assays, and ectopic expression in transgenic plants demonstrate that these ERF genes are able to bind the GCC-box elements residing in the step-limiting gene promoters (such as NtPMT2, NtQPT2) and functional redundant but quantitatively transactivate nicotine biosynthetic gene expression. For nic1-locus mutation, two different sizes of deletions (nic1-S and nic1-B) were identified which occurred at the surrounding regions of the NIC1-locus gene cluster, which might disrupt, to some extent, chromosomal microenvironment and change gene expression around the deletion regions (including NIC1-locus ERFs), resulting in the decreased expression levels of NIC1-locus ERFs (such as NtERF199) and reduced alkaloid accumulation in the nic1-locus mutant.Conclusions Our findings not only provide insight in to the mechanism of the NIC1-locus ERFs in the regulatory network of nicotine biosynthesis, but also unraveled the theoretical basis of the nic1-locus mutation in low nicotine mutant. These functional verified NIC1-locus ERF genes can be further used as potential target(s) for ethyl methanesulfonate-based mutagenesis to manipulate nicotine level in tobacco variety in tobacco breeding program.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.AbbreviationsA622a PIP family oxidoredutase for nicotine precursors condensationODCornithine decarboxylaseADCarginine decarboxylasePMTputrescine N-methyltransferaseMPON-methylputrescine oxidaseAOaspartate oxidaseQSquinolinic acid synthaseQPTqunolinic acid phosphoribosyl transferaseSPDSspermidine synthaseSAMSS-adenosylmethionine synthaseSAMDCS-adenosylmethione decarboxylasePCRPolymerase chain reactionRNA-seqRNA SequencingRPKMReads Per Kilobase per Million mapped readsSSRsimple sequence repeatqRT-PCRQuantitative real-time PCRCRchromosome rearrangementCNVcopy number variantView Full Text",
