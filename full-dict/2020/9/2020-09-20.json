    "abstract": "Antibodies are essential tools in research and diagnostics. While antibody fragments can be rapidly produced in Escherichia coli, full-length antibodies with an Fc region or antibodies modified with probes are time and labor intensive in production.\n\nSpyTag/SpyCatcher protein ligation technology could covalently attach such functionalities to antibody fragments equipped with a SpyTag. However, we found that the necessarily periplasmic expression of such antibody fragments in E. coli led to rapid cleavage of the SpyTag by proteases.\n\nHere we show how this cleavage can be prevented, making the SpyTag technology accessible for E. coli produced antibodies. We demonstrate a modular toolbox for rapid creation of synthetic IgGs, oligomerized antibodies, and antibodies with different tags or enzymatic functionalities and measure their performance in a variety of immunoassays. Furthermore, we demonstrate surface immobilization, high-throughput screening of antibody libraries, and rapid prototyping of antibodies based on modular antibody assembly.",

    "abstract": "Registration of histology images from multiple sources is a pressing problem in large-scale studies of spatial -omics data. Researchers often perform \"common coordinate registration,\" akin to segmentation, in which samples are partitioned based on tissue type to allow for quantitative comparison of similar regions across samples. Accuracy in such registration requires both high image resolution and global awareness, which mark a difficult balancing act for contemporary deep learning architectures. We present a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that combines (1) a local classification CNN that extracts features from image patches sampled sparsely across the tissue surface, and (2) a global segmentation CNN that operates on these extracted features. This hybrid network can be trained in an end-to-end manner, and we demonstrate its relative merits over competing approaches on a reference histology dataset as well as two published spatial transcriptomics datasets. We believe that this paradigm will greatly enhance our ability to process spatial -omics data, and has general purpose applications for the processing of high-resolution histology images on commercially available GPUs.",

    "abstract": "Identifying genetic markers for cancer is one of the main challenges in the recent researches. Between different cohorts of genetic markers such as genes or a group of genes like pathways or sub-network, identifying functional modules like subnetwork markers has been more challenging. Network-based classification methods have been successfully used for finding effective cancer subnetwork markers. Combination of metabolic networks and molecular profiles of tumor samples has led researchers to a more accurate prediction of subnetwork markers. However, topological features of the network have not been considered in the activity of the subnetwork. Here, we apply a novel protein-protein interaction network-based classification method that considers topological features of the network in addition to the expression profiles of the samples. We have considered the problem of identifying cancer subnetwork markers as a multi-objective problem which in this approach, each subnetworks activity level is measured according to both objectives of the problem; Differential expression level of the genes and topological features of the nodes in the network. We found that the subnetwork markers identified by this method achieve higher performance in the classification of cancer outcome in comparison to the other subnetwork markers.",

    "abstract": "The RNA velocity provides a new avenue to study the stemness and lineage of cells in the development in scRNA-seq data analysis. Some promising extensions of it are proposed and the community is experiencing a fast developing period. However, in this stage, it is of prime importance to revisit the whole process of RNA velocity analysis from the mathematical point of view, which will help to understand the rationale and drawbacks of different proposals. The current paper is devoted to this purpose. We present a thorough mathematical study on the RNA velocity model from dynamics to downstream data analysis. We derived the analytical solution of the RNA velocity model from both deterministic and stochastic point of view. We presented the parameter inference framework based on the maximum likelihood estimate. We also derived the continuum limit of different downstream analysis methods, which provides insights on the construction of transition probability matrix, root and endingcells identification, and the development routes finding. The overall analysis aims at providing a mathematical basis for more advanced design and development of RNA velocity type methods in the future.",

Using cryo-EM, we visualized the structure of the mysterious viral tRNA-like structure (TLS) from brome mosaic virus (BMV), which affects replication, translation, and genome encapsidation. Structures in isolation and bound to tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) show that this [~]55 kDa purported tRNA mimic undergoes large conformational rearrangements to bind TyrRS in a form that differs dramatically from tRNA.

    "abstract": "Interactions between liquids and surfaces generate forces1,2 that are crucial for many processes in biology, physics, and engineering, including the motion of insects on the surface of water3, modulation of the material properties of spider silk4, and self-assembly of microstructures5. Recent studies have shown that cells assemble biomolecular condensates via phase separation6. In the nucleus, these condensates are thought to drive transcription7, heterochromatin formation8, nucleolus assembly9, and DNA repair10. Here, we show that the interaction between liquid-like condensates and DNA generates forces that might play a role in bringing distant regulatory elements of DNA together, a key step in transcriptional regulation. We combine quantitative microscopy, in vitro reconstitution, optical tweezers, and theory to show that the transcription factor FoxA1 mediates the condensation of a DNA-protein phase via a mesoscopic first- order phase transition. After nucleation, co-condensation forces drive growth of this phase by pulling non-condensed DNA. Altering the tension on the DNA strand enlarges or dissolves the condensates, revealing their mechanosensitive nature. These findings show that DNA condensation mediated by transcription factors could bring distant regions of DNA in close proximity, suggesting that this physical mechanism is a possible general regulatory principle for chromatin organization that may be relevant in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Structure determination methods are needed to resolve the atomic details that underlie protein function. X-ray crystallography has provided most of our knowledge of protein structure but is constrained by the need for large, well-ordered crystals and the loss of phase information. The rapidly developing methods of serial femtosecond crystallography, micro-electron diffraction, and single-particle reconstruction circumvent the first of these limitations by enabling data collection from nanocrystals or purified proteins. However, the first two methods also suffer from the phase problem, while many proteins fall below the molecular weight threshold required by single-particle reconstruction. Cryo-electron tomography of protein nanocrystals has the potential to overcome these obstacles of mainstream structure determination methods. Here we present a data processing scheme that combines routines from X-ray crystallography and new algorithms we developed to solve structures from tomograms of nanocrystals. This pipeline handles image processing challenges specific to tomographic sampling of periodic specimens and is validated using simulated crystals. We also assess the tolerance of this workflow to the effects of radiation damage. Our simulations indicate a trade-off between a wider tilt-range to facilitate merging data from multiple tomograms and a smaller tilt increment to improve phase accuracy. Since phase errors but not merging errors can be overcome with additional datasets, these results recommend distributing the dose over a wide angular range rather than using a finer sampling interval to solve the protein structure.",

    "abstract": "The Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control (DMCC) project provides an ambitious and rigorous empirical test of a theoretical framework that posits two key cognitive control modes: proactive and reactive. The frameworks central tenets are that proactive and reactive control reflect domain-general dimensions of individual variation, with distinctive neural signatures, involving lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) in interactions with other brain networks and circuits (e.g., frontoparietal, cingulo-opercular). In the DMCC project, each participant is scanned while performing theoretically-targeted variants of multiple well-established cognitive control tasks (Stroop, Cued Task-Switching, AX-CPT, Sternberg Working Memory) in three separate imaging sessions, that each encourage utilization of different control modes, plus also completes an extensive out-of-scanner individual differences battery. Additional key features of the project include a high spatio-temporal resolution (multiband) acquisition protocol, and a sample that includes a substantial subset of monozygotic twin pairs and participants recruited from the Human Connectome Project. Although data collection is still continuing (target N=200), we provide an overview of the study design and protocol, planned analytic approaches and methodological development, along with initial results (N=80) revealing novel evidence of a domain-general neural signature of reactive control. In the interests of scientific community building, the dataset will be made public at project completion, so it can serve as a valuable resource.",

    "abstract": "Acute caffeine intake can attenuate homeostatic sleep pressure and worsen sleep quality. Besides, caffeine intake - particularly in high doses and close to bedtime - may also affect circadian-regulated REM sleep promotion, an important determinant of subjective sleep quality. However, it is not known whether such changes persist under chronic caffeine consumption during daytime. Twenty male caffeine consumers (26.4 {+/-} 4 years old, habitual caffeine intake 478.1 {+/-} 102.8 mg/day) participated in a double-blind crossover study. Each volunteer completed a caffeine (3 x 150 mg caffeine daily), a withdrawal (3 x 150 mg caffeine for eight days then placebo), and a placebo condition. After ten days of controlled intake and a fixed sleep-wake cycle, we recorded 8 h of electroencephalography starting 5 h after habitual bedtime (i.e., start on average at 04:22 am which is around the peak of circadian REM sleep promotion). A 60 min evening nap preceded each sleep episode and reduced high sleep pressure levels. While total sleep time and sleep architecture did not significantly differ between the three conditions, REM latency was longer after daily caffeine intake compared to both placebo and withdrawal. Moreover, the accumulation of REM sleep proportion was slower, and volunteers reported more difficulties at awakening after sleep and feeling more tired upon wake-up in the caffeine condition compared to placebo. Our data indicate that besides acute also regular daytime caffeine intake affects REM sleep regulation in men. We have evidence that regular caffeine intake during daytime weakens circadian sleep promotion when compared to placebo. Moreover, the observed caffeine-induced deterioration in the quality of awakening may suggest a potential motive to reinstate caffeine intake after sleep.",

Oral contraceptives (OC) and hormone therapy (HT) and are both common sources of exogenous estrogen for women in reproductive and post-menopausal years, respectively. Here we examined the association of exogenous sex hormone exposure with the brains white matter (WM) aging trajectories in postmenopausal women using and not using OC and HT (HT users: n=3,033, non-users n=5,093; OC users: n=6,964; non-users n=1,156), while also investigating multiple dMRI models. Cross-sectional brain dMRI data was analyzed from the UK Biobank using conventional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), the tensor distribution function (TDF), and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI). Mean skeletonized diffusivity measures were extracted across the whole brain, and fractional polynomial regressions were used to characterize age-related trajectories for WM microstructural measures. Advanced dMRI model NODDI revealed a steeper WM aging trajectory in HT users relative to non-users, and for those using unopposed estrogens relative to combined estrogens treatment. By contrast, no interaction was detected between OC status and age effects on the diffusivity measures we examined. Exogenous sex hormone exposure may negatively impact WM microstructure aging in postmenopausal women. We also present normative reference curves for white matter microarchitectural parameters in women, to help identify individuals with microstructural anomalies.",

    "abstract": "Though dividing ones attention between two input streams typically impairs performance, detecting a behaviorally relevant stimulus can sometimes enhance the encoding of unrelated information presented at the same time. Previous research has shown that selection of this kind boosts visual cortical activity and memory for concurrent items. An important unanswered question is whether such effects are reflected in processing quality and functional connectivity in visual regions and in the hippocampus. In this fMRI study, participants were asked to memorize a stream of naturalistic images and press a button only when they heard a predefined target tone (400 or 1200 Hz, counterbalanced). Images could be presented with a target tone, with a distractor tone, or without a tone. Auditory target detection increased activity throughout the ventral visual cortex but lowered it in the hippocampus. Enhancements in functional connectivity between the ventral visual cortex and the hippocampus were also observed following auditory targets. Multi-voxel pattern classification of image category was more accurate on target tone trials than on distractor and no tone trials in the fusiform gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus. This effect was stronger in visual cortical clusters whose activity was more correlated with the hippocampus on target tone than on distractor tone trials. In agreement with accounts suggesting that subcortical noradrenergic influences play a role in the attentional boost effect, auditory target detection also caused an increase in locus coeruleus activity and phasic pupil responses. These findings outline a network of cortical and subcortical regions that are involved in the selection and processing of information presented at behaviorally relevant moments.",

    "abstract": "Soon after Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) skin infection, neutrophils infiltrate the LN via the high endothelial venules (HEVs) to restrain and kill the invading microbes to prevent systemic spread of microbes. In this study, we found that rapid neutrophil migration depends on lymph flow, through which inflammatory chemokines/cytokines produced in the infected tissue are transported to the LN. Without lymph flow, bacteria accumulation in the LN was insufficient to stimulate chemokine production or neutrophil migration. Oxazolone (OX)-induced skin inflammation impaired lymphatic function, and reduced chemokines in the LN after a secondary infection with S. aureus. Due to LN reconstruction and impaired conduit-mediated lymph flow, neutrophil preferentially transmigrated in HEVs located in the medullary sinus, where the HEVs remained exposed to lymph-borne chemokines. Altered neutrophil migration resulted in persistent infection in the LN. Our studies showed that lymph flow directed chemokine dispersal in the LN and ensured rapid neutrophil migration for timely immune protection in infection. The impaired lymph flow and neutrophil migration may contribute to the frequent infection in skin inflammation, such as atopic dermatitis.",

    "abstract": "Coral reefs are experiencing declines due to climate change and local human impacts. While at local scale biodiversity loss induces shifts in community structure, previous biogeographical analyses recorded consistent taxonomic structure of fish communities across global coral reefs. This suggest that regional communities represent a random subset of the global species and traits pool, whatever their species richness. Using distributional data on 3,586 fish species and latest advances in species distribution models we show that the global distribution of reef fishes is influenced by two major traits (body size and diet) and produces a strong divergence in the trait structure of assemblages across the biodiversity gradient. This divergence is best explained by the isolation of reefs during past unfavorable climatic conditions and highlights the risk of a global community re-organization if the ongoing climate-induced reef fragmentation is not halted.",

    "abstract": "Animal movement and resource use are tightly linked. Investigating these links to understand how animals utilize space and select habitats is especially relevant in areas that have been affected by habitat fragmentation and agricultural conversion. We set out to explore the space use and habitat selection of Burmese pythons (Python bivittatus) in a patchy land use matrix dominated by agricultural crops and human settlements. We used radio telemetry to record daily locations of seven Burmese pythons over the course of our study period of approximately 22 months. We created dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Models (dBBMMs) for all individuals, using occurrence distributions to estimate extent of movements and motion variance to reveal temporal patterns. Then we used integrated step selection functions to determine whether individual movements were associated with particular landscape features (aquatic agriculture, forest, roads, settlements, terrestrial agriculture, water), and whether there were consistent associations at the population level. Our dBBMM estimates suggested that Burmese pythons made use of small areas (98.97 {+/-} 35.42 ha), with low mean individual motion variance characterized by infrequent moves and long periods at a single location. At both the individual and population level, Burmese pythons in the agricultural matrix were associated with aquatic environments. Only one individual showed a strong avoidance for human settlements which is troublesome from a human-wildlife conflict angle, especially as Burmese pythons have been observed entering human settlements and consuming livestock in our study site. Our study is one of the first to contribute to the knowledge of Burmese python ecology in their native range as the majority of studies have focused on invasive populations.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMigration from one environment to another often causes marked changes in developmental conditions. Here we compare epigenetic ageing and stability of the epigenetic maintenance system among British-Bangladeshi women who grew up in Bangladesh (adult migrants), where there are higher pathogen loads and poorer health care, to second-generation Bangladeshis who grew up in the UK. In our previous studies of these migrants, those who spent their childhoods in Bangladesh also had lower levels of reproductive hormones and a shorter reproductive lifespan compared to those who grew up in the UK, suggesting life history trade-offs during development. In the present study, we hypothesised that women who grew up in Bangladesh would have i) an older epigenetic/biological age compared to the women with a childhood in the UK and ii) that differences in the pace of epigenetic ageing might also be reflected by altered stability of DNA methylation marks.\n\nResultsIllumina EPIC array methylation data from buccal tissue was used to establish epigenetic age estimates from 15 adult migrants and 11 second-generation migrants, aged 18-35 years. Using residuals from linear regression of DNA methylation-based biological age (DNAm age) on the chronological age, the results showed significant differences (p=0.016) in epigenetic age estimates: women whose childhood was in Bangladesh are on average 6.02 ({+/-} 2.34) years older, than those who grew up in London. We further investigated the efficiency of the epigenetic maintenance system which purportedly is reflected by epigenetic clocks. Methylation states of CpGs at the LHCGR/LHR locus, which contributes to Horvaths multi tissue epigenetic clock were evaluated. Based on the Ratio of Concordance Preference (RCP) approach that uses double-stranded methylation data, we find that maintenance of epigenetic information is more stable in women who grew up in Bangladesh.\n\nConclusionsThe work supports earlier findings that adverse childhood environments lead to phenotypic life history trade-offs. The data indicate that childhood environments can induce subtle changes to the epigenetic maintenance system that are detectable long after exposure occurred. The implication of such a finding warrants further investigation as it implies that a less flexible epigenetic memory system established early in life could reduce the capacity to respond to different environmental conditions in adult life.",

    "abstract": "The reference sequence of structurally complex regions can only be obtained through a highly accurate clone-based approach that we call Single-Haplotype Iterative Mapping and Sequencing (SHIMS). In recent years, improvements to SHIMS have reduced the cost and time required by two orders of magnitude, but internally repetitive clones still require extensive manual effort to transform draft assemblies into reference-quality finished sequences. Here we describe SHIMS 3.0, an extension of our SHIMS sequencing strategy, using ultra-long nanopore reads to augment the Illumina data from SHIMS 2.0 assemblies and resolve internally repetitive structures. This greatly minimizes the need for manual finishing of Illumina-based draft assemblies, allowing a small team with no prior finishing experience to sequence challenging targets with high accuracy. This protocol proceeds from clone-picking to finished assemblies in 2 weeks for about 80 dollars per clone. We recently used this protocol to produce reference sequence of structurally complex palindromes on chimpanzee and rhesus macaque X chromosomes; as a further demonstration of the capabilities of SHIMS 3.0, we finish the TSPY array on the human Y chromosome, which could not be resolved by previous sequencing methods. Our protocol provides access to structurally complex regions that would otherwise be inaccessible from whole-genome shotgun data or require an impractical amount of manual effort to generate an accurate assembly.",

In these experiments, often performed with mass spectrometry (MS), data must be corrected for natural abundance of isotopes. Various stand-alone tools with their own separate data formats and learning curves exist for correction of data collected at different resolutions, for tandem MS, and for different number of tracer elements.\n\nResultsWe present a Python package, Corna, that combines natural abundance correction workflows for several experimental conditions and can be used as a one-stop-shop for stable isotope labeled experiments. We validate the algorithms in Corna with published tools, where available, and include new features, such as correction of two tracer elements, that are not yet implemented in any existing software application as per our knowledge.

    "abstract": "Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) has a key function in the reverse cholesterol transport mediated by the high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. However, aggregation of apoA-I single point mutants can lead to hereditary amyloid pathology. Although several studies have tackled the biophysical and structural impacts introduced by these mutations, there is little information addressing the relationship between the evolutionary and structural features that contribute to the amyloid behavior of apoA-I. We combined evolutionary studies, in silico mutagenesis and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to provide a comprehensive analysis of the conservation and pathogenic role of the aggregation-prone regions (APRs) present in apoA-I. Sequence analysis demonstrated that among the four amyloidogenic regions described for human apoA-I, only two (APR1 and APR4) are evolutionary conserved across different species of Sarcopterygii. Moreover, stability analysis carried out with the FoldX engine showed that APR1 contributes to the marginal stability of apoA-I. Structural properties of the full-length apoA-I model suggest that aggregation is avoided by placing APRs into highly packed and rigid portions of its native fold. Following we set up to study the effect of natural mutations on protein conformation and stability. Compared to natural silent variants extracted from the gnomAD database, the thermodynamic and pathogenic impact of apoA-I amyloid mutations showed evidence of a higher destabilizing effect. MD simulations of the amyloid variant G26R evidenced the partial unfolding of the alpha-helix bundle with the concomitant exposure of APR1 to the solvent and the formation of beta-sheet segments at the C-terminus of apoA-I, giving a possible hint about the early steps involved in its aggregation. Our findings highlight APR1 as a relevant component for apoA-I structural integrity and emphasize a destabilizing effect of amyloid variants that leads to the exposure of this region. This information contributes to our understanding of how apoA-I, with its high degree of structural flexibility, maintains a delicate equilibrium between its monomeric native structure and intrinsic tendency to form amyloid aggregates. In addition, our stability measurements could be used as a proxy to interpret the structural impact of new mutations.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental question in biology is how morphogenesis integrates the multitude of distinct processes that act at different scales, ranging from the molecular control of gene expression to cellular coordination in a tissue. Investigating morphogenesis of complex organs strongly benefits from three-dimensional representations of the organ under study. Here, we present a digital analysis of ovule development from Arabidopsis thaliana as a paradigm for a complex morphogenetic process. Using machine-learning-based image analysis we generated a three-dimensional atlas of ovule development with cellular resolution. It allows quantitative stage- and tissue-specific analysis of cellular patterns. Exploiting a fluorescent reporter enabled precise spatial determination of gene expression patterns, revealing subepidermal expression of WUSCHEL. Underlying the power of our approach, we found that primordium outgrowth progresses evenly, discovered a novel mode of forming a new cell layer, and detected a new function of INNER NO OUTER in restricting cell proliferation in the nucellus. Moreover, we identified two distinct subepidermal cell populations that make crucial contributions to ovule curvature. Our work demonstrates the expedience of a three-dimensional digital representation when studying the morphogenesis of an organ of complex cellular architecture and shape that eventually consists of 1,900 cells.",

    "abstract": "Network inference is a notoriously challenging problem. Inferred networks are associated with high uncertainty and likely riddled with false positive and false negative interactions. Especially for biological networks we do not have good ways of judging the performance of inference methods against real networks, and instead we often rely solely on the performance against simulated data. Gaining confidence in networks inferred from real data nevertheless thus requires establishing reliable validation methods. Here, we argue that the expectation of mixing patterns in biological networks such as gene regulatory networks offers a reasonable starting point: interactions are more likely to occur between nodes with similar biological functions. We can quantify this behaviour using the assortativity coefficient, and here we show that the resulting heuristic, functional assortativity, offers a reliable and informative route for comparing different inference algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Genome-scale reaction network models are available for many prokaryotic organisms. Yet, to predict the proteome and metabolome of the cell from them, additional information about (i) the nonlinear enzyme kinetics and (ii) the regulation of protein expression by metabolic signals is necessary. Knowledge about the latter could be sidestepped by assuming that expression regulation has evolved to achieve the protein composition that maximizes cellular growth rate. A general mathematical framework for optimizing the growth rate of models comprising an arbitrarily complex metabolic network and a relatively simple protein-synthesis network was recently formulated independently by two research groups [de Groot et al., PLoS Comput. Biol. 16, e1007559 (2020); Dourado & Lercher, Nature Commun. 11, 1226 (2020)]. Here, this formalism is further developed with particular focus on carrying out the optimization numerically. To this end, we identify the concentrations of the enzymes as the independent variables of the optimization problem and propose novel multiplicative updates for the iterative calculation of the dependent metabolite concentrations. The reduced gradient method, with analytical derivatives, is employed for the numerical optimization. Additionally, the roles of the dilution of the metabolite concentrations by growth and the commonly invoked constraint on the cell dry mass density are clarified. These developments should lay the basis for the practical optimization of large-scale kinetic models, thus formally connecting the physiological \"macrostate\" of the cell, characterized by its growth rate, to its \"microstate\", described by the cell proteome and metabolome.\n\nAuthor summaryAn evolving population of non-interacting, unicellular organisms in a constant environment will maximize its growth rate. By expressing the growth rate as a mathematical function of the cellular composition, it becomes possible to formulate an optimization problem whose solution yields the cell proteome and metabolome at the maximal growth rate. The formulation and solution of such an optimization problem has the potential to elucidate fundamental optimality principles in living cells and to enable the engineering of complex biological systems. Building on previous work, here we address the task of solving this optimization problem numerically. In the process, we elucidate the mathematical role of some common simplifying approximations. This allows us to organize many of the existing formulations of the optimization problem into a hierarchy, whose lower levels are reached by invoking these approximations.",

    "abstract": "The highly neurotropic rabies virus (RABV) enters peripheral neurons at axon termini and requires long distance axonal transport and trans-synaptic spread between neurons for the infection of the central nervous system (CNS). Whereas laboratory strains are almost exclusively detected in neurons, recent 3D imaging of field RABV-infected brains revealed an remarkably high proportion of infected astroglia, indicating that in contrast to attenuated lab strains highly virulent field viruses are able to suppress astrocyte mediated innate immune responses and virus elimination pathways. While fundamental for CNS invasion, in vivo field RABV spread and tropism in peripheral tissues is understudied. Here, we used three-dimensional light sheet and confocal laser scanning microscopy to investigate the in vivo distribution patterns of a field RABV clone in cleared high-volume tissue samples after infection via a natural (intramuscular; hind leg) and an artificial (intracranial) inoculation route. Immunostaining of virus and host markers provided a comprehensive overview of RABV infection in the CNS and peripheral nerves after centripetal and centrifugal virus spread. Importantly, we identified non-neuronal,axon-ensheathing neuroglia (Schwann cells, SCs) in peripheral nerves of the hind leg and facial regions as a target cell population of field RABV. This suggest that virus release from axons and infected SCs is part of the RABV in vivo cycle and may affect RABV-related demyelination of peripheral neurons and local innate immune responses. Detection of RABV in axon surrounding myelinating SCs after i.c. infection further provided evidence for anterograde spread of RABV, highlighting that RABV axonal transport and spread of infectious virus in peripheral nerves is not exclusively retrograde. Our data support a new model in which, comparable to CNS neuroglia, SC infection in peripheral nerves suppresses glia-mediated innate immunity and delays antiviral host responses required for successful transport from the peripheral infection sites to the brain.",

    "abstract": "Loading of the MCM replicative helicase onto origins of replication is a highly regulated process that precedes DNA replication in all eukaryotes. The number of MCM loaded on origins has been proposed to be a key determinant of when those origins initiate replication during S phase. Nevertheless, the genome-wide characteristics of MCM loading and their direct effect on replication timing remain unclear. In order to probe MCM loading dynamics and its effect on replication timing, we perturbed MCM levels in budding yeast cells and, for the first time, directly measured MCM levels and replication timing in the same experiment. Reduction of MCM levels through degradation of Mcm4, one of the six obligate components of the MCM complex, slowed progression through S phase and increased sensitivity to replication stress. Reduction of MCM levels also led to differential loading at origins during G1, revealing origins that are sensitive to reductions in MCM and others that are not. Sensitive origins loaded less MCM under normal conditions and correlated with a weak ability to recruit the origin recognition complex (ORC). Moreover, reduction of MCM loading at specific origins of replication led to a delay in their initiation during S phase. In contrast, overexpression of MCM had no effects on cell cycle progression, relative MCM levels at origins, or replication timing, suggesting that, under optimal growth conditions, cellular MCM levels not limiting for MCM loading. Our results support a model in which the loading activity of origins, controlled by their ability to recruit ORC and compete for MCM, determines the number of helicases loaded, which in turn affects replication timing.",

    "abstract": "Filopodia are actin-rich structures, present on the surface of practically every known eukaryotic cell. These structures play a pivotal role in specific cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions by allowing cells to explore their environment, generate mechanical forces, perform chemical signaling, or convey signals via intercellular tunneling nano-bridges. The dynamics of filopodia appear quite complex as they exhibit a rich behavior of buckling, pulling, length and shape changes. Here, we find that filopodia additionally explore their 3D extracellular space by combining growth and shrinking with axial twisting and buckling of their actin rich core. Importantly, we show the rotational dynamics of the filamentous actin inside filopodia for a range of highly distinct and cognate cell types spanning from earliest development to highly differentiated tissue cells. Non-equilibrium physical modeling of actin and myosin confirm that twist, and hence rotation, is an emergent phenomenon of active filaments confined in a narrow channel which points to a generic mechanism present in all cells. Our measurements confirm that filopodia exert traction forces and form helical buckles in a range of different cell types that can be ascribed to accumulation of sufficient twist. These results lead us to conclude that activity induced twisting of the actin shaft is a general mechanism underlying fundamental functions of filopodia.",

    "abstract": "Signaling networks mediate many aspects of cellular function. The conventional, mechanistically motivated approach to modeling such networks is through mass-action chemistry, which maps directly to biological entities and facilitates experimental tests and predictions. However such models are complex, need many parameters, and are computationally costly. Here we introduce the HillTau form for signaling models. HillTau retains the direct mapping to biological observables, but it uses far fewer parameters, and is 100 to over 1000 times faster than ODE-based methods. In the HillTau formalism, the steady-state concentration of signaling molecules is approximated by the Hill equation, and the dynamics by a time-course tau. We demonstrate its use in implementing several biochemical motifs, including association, inhibition, feedforward and feedback inhibition, bistability, oscillations, and a synaptic switch obeying the BCM rule. The major use-cases for HillTau are system abstraction, model reduction, scaffolds for data-driven optimization, and fast approximations to complex cellular signaling.\n\nAuthor summaryChemical signals mediate many computations in cells, from housekeeping functions in all cells to memory and pattern selectivity in neurons. These signals form complex networks of interactions. Computer models are a powerful way to study how such networks behave, but it is hard to get all the chemical details for typical models, and it is slow to run them with standard numerical approaches to chemical kinetics. We introduce HillTau as a simplified way to model complex chemical networks. HillTau models condense multiple reaction steps into single steps defined by a small number of parameters for activation and settling time. As a result the models are simple, easy to find values for, and they run quickly. Remarkably, they fit the full chemical formulations rather well. We illustrate the utility of HillTau for modeling several signaling network functions, and for fitting complicated signaling networks.",

    "abstract": "It is registered for the first time, the encounter of Lutzomyia edwardsi (Mangabeira) species of sandfly considered as a probable vector of Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis (Vianna), main etiological agent of American cutaneous leishmaniasis in humans, for the municipality of Sumidouro, State of Rio of Janeiro. Leishmaniasis is currently considered a neglected tropical disease in the Americas. The objective of this study was to know the phlebotomine fauna in an area of Atlantic forest, with a cave in this municipality. From the sandflies collected, in 2009 and 2010, with a light trap, type CDC it is reported in a unique way, the encounter of a female L. edwardsi, infected with nematodes in a cave in the locality of Sao Caetano, in Sumidouro, state of Rio of Janeiro, Brazil. The description of sandfly and nematodes was carried out. The presence of this species in areas of leishmaniasis cases in the municipality of Sumidouro and its surroundings, requires the adoption of relevant entomological and / or epidemiological surveillance, by the Municipal Health Department of the region, when registering this disease.",

Many studies have investigated the process of adult neurogenesis, but factors deciding between neuronal and astroglial fate are incompletely understood. Here, we evaluate the functions of the transcription factor zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) in adult hippocampal RGL cells using a conditional-inducible mouse model. We find that ZEB1 is necessary for self-renewal of active RGL cells as well as for astroglial lineage specification. Genetic deletion of Zeb1 causes differentiation-coupled depletion of RGL cells resulting in an increase of newborn neurons at the expense of newly generated astrocytes. This is due to a shift towards symmetric cell divisions that consume the RGL cell and generate pro-neuronal progenies. We identify ZEB1 as a regulator of stem cell self-renewal and lineage specification in the adult hippocampus.",

    "abstract": "Culicoides imicola (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) is an important Afrotropical and Palearctic vector of disease, transmitting viruses of animal health and economic significance. The apparent incursions of C. imicola into mainland Europe via wind-movement events has made it important to trace this species to better predict new areas of arbovirus outbreaks. A widely used method for tracking dispersal patterns of C. imicola employs a phylogeographic approach anchored on the mtDNA marker COI (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I). However, a problem with this approach is that maternally-inherited symbiotic bacteria can alter the frequency of COI mitochondrial haplotypes (mitotypes), masking the true patterns of movement and gene flow. In this study, we investigate possible associations of the symbiont Cardinium with C. imicola mitotype distribution. Haplotype network analysis indicates the concordance of specific mitotypes with Cardinium infection status in C. imicola populations from the Mediterranean basin and South Africa. This observation urges caution on the single usage of the COI marker to determine population structure and movement in C. imicola, and instead suggests the complementary utilisation of additional molecular markers (e.g. microsatellites and nuclear markers).",

    "abstract": "Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs), as antihypertensive drugs, have drawn attention for their benefits to individuals with diabetes and prediabetes. However, the effects of ARBs on insulin secretion remain unclear. Here, we investigated the insulinotropic effects of ARBs (telmisartan, valsartan, and irbesartan) and the underlying electrophysiological mechanism in rat islets. We found that only telmisartan among the three ARBs exhibited an insulin secretagogue role. Distinct from other ARBs, telmisartan exerted effects on ion channels including voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels to promote extracellular Ca2+ influx, thereby potentiating insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. We observed that the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor {gamma} pathway was not involved in these telmisartan-induced effects. Furthermore, we identified that telmisartan at least directly inhibited Kv2.1 channel through construction of a Chinese hamster ovary cell line with Kv2.1 channel overexpression. Acute exposure of type 2 diabetes model (db/db) mice to a telmisartan dose equivalent to therapeutic doses in humans resulted in lower blood glucose and increased plasma insulin concentration in the oral glucose tolerance test. We further observed the telmisartan-induced insulinotropic and electrophysiological effects on pathological pancreatic islets isolated from db/db mice. Collectively, our results establish an important function of telmisartan distinct from other ARBs in the treatment of diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Statistical methodology for testing Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at X chromosomal variants has recently experienced considerable development. Up to a few years ago, testing X chromosomal variants for equilibrium was basically done by applying autosomal test procedures to females only. At present, male alleles can be taken into account in asymptotic and exact test procedures for both the bi- and multiallelic case. However, current X chromosomal exact procedures for multiple alleles rely on a classical full enumeration algorithm and are computationally expensive, and in practice not feasible for more than three alleles. In this article we extend the autosomal network algorithm for exact Hardy-Weinberg testing with multiple alleles to the X chromosome, achieving considerable reduction in computation times for multiallelic variants with up to five alleles. The performance of the X-chromosomal network algorithm is assessed in a simulation study. Beyond four alleles, a permutation test is, in general, the more feasible approach. A detailed description of the algorithm is given and examples of X chromosomal indels and microsatellites are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Reversible phosphorylation has emerged as an important mechanism for regulating 26S proteasome function in health and disease. Over 100 phospho-tyrosine (pTyr) sites of the human proteasome have been detected, and yet their function and regulation remain poorly understood. Here we show that the 19S subunit Rpt2 is phosphorylated at Tyr439, a strictly conserved residue within the C-terminal HbYX motif of Rpt2 that is essential for 26S proteasome assembly. Unexpectedly, we found that Y439 phosphorylation depends on Rpt2 membrane localization mediated by its N-myristoylation. Multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) can trigger Rpt2-Y439 phosphorylation by activating Src, a N-myristoylated tyrosine kinase. Src directly phosphorylates Rpt2-Y439 in vitro and negatively regulates 26S proteasome integrity and activity at cellular membranes, which can be reversed by the membrane-associated isoform of protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2). In H1975 lung cancer cells with activated Src, blocking Rpt2-Y439 phosphorylation by the Y439F mutation conferred partial resistance to the Src inhibitor saracatinib both in vitro and in a mouse xenograft tumor model, and caused significant changes of cellular responses to saracatinib at the proteome level. Our study has defined a novel mechanism involved in the spatial regulation of proteasome function and provided new insights into tyrosine kinase inhibitor-based anti-cancer therapies.",

Relative to the original method, microbead-based SiMPull is considerably faster, easier to use, and more reproducible and yet provides similar sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio; specifically, with the new method, sample-preparation time is substantially decreased (from [~]10 to [~]3 h). These crucial features should facilitate wide application of powerful and versatile SiMPull in common biological and clinical laboratories. Notably, by exploiting the simplicity and ultrahigh sensitivity of microbead-based SiMPull, we used this method in the study of rare auditory hair cells for the first time.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies underline the contribution of brain-computer interface (BCI) applications to the enhancement process of the life quality of physically impaired subjects. In this context, to design an effective stroke rehabilitation or assistance system, the classification of motor imagery (MI) tasks are performed through deep learning (DL) algorithms. Although the utilization of DL in the BCI field remains relatively premature as compared to the fields related to natural language processing, object detection, etc., DL has proven its effectiveness in carrying out this task. In this paper, a hybrid method, which fuses the one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) with the long short-term memory (LSTM), was performed for classifying four different MI tasks, i.e. left hand, right hand, tongue, and feet movements. The time representation of MI tasks is extracted through the hybrid deep learning model training after principal component analysis (PCA)-based artefact removal process. The performance criteria given in the BCI Competition IV dataset A are estimated. 10-folded Cross-validation (CV) results show that the proposed method outperforms in classifying electroencephalogram (EEG)-electrooculogram (EOG) combined motor imagery tasks compared to the state of art methods and is robust against data variations. The CNN-LSTM classification model reached 95.62 % ({+/-}1.2290742) accuracy and 0.9462 ({+/-}0.01216265) kappa value for datasets with four MI-based class validated using 10-fold CV. Also, the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) score, and confusion matrix are evaluated for further interpretations.",

    "abstract": "Automatic cerebral cortical surface reconstruction is a useful tool for cortical anatomy quantification, analysis and visualization. Recently, the Human Connectome Project and several studies have shown the advantages of using T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images with sub-millimeter isotropic spatial resolution instead of the standard 1-millimeter isotropic resolution for improved accuracy of cortical surface positioning and thickness estimation. Nonetheless, sub-millimeter resolution images are noisy by nature and require averaging multiple repetitions to increase the signal-to-noise ratio for precisely delineating the cortical boundary. The prolonged acquisition time and potential motion artifacts pose significant barriers to the wide adoption of cortical surface reconstruction at sub-millimeter resolution for a broad range of neuroscientific and clinical applications. We address this challenge by evaluating the cortical surface reconstruction resulting from denoised single-repetition sub-millimeter T1-weighted images. We systematically characterized the effects of image denoising on empirical data acquired at 0.6 mm isotropic resolution using three classical denoising methods, including denoising convolutional neural network (DnCNN), block-matching and 4-dimensional filtering (BM4D) and adaptive optimized non-local means (AONLM). The denoised single-repetition images were found to be highly similar to 6-repetition averaged images, with a low whole-brain averaged mean absolute difference of [~]0.016, high whole-brain averaged peak signal-to-noise ratio of [~]33.5 dB and structural similarity index of 0.92, and minimal gray matter-white matter contrast loss (2% to 9%). The whole-brain mean absolute discrepancies in gray-white surface placement, gray-CSF surface placement and cortical thickness estimation were lower than 165 m, 155 m and 145 m--sufficiently accurate for most applications. The denoising performance is equivalent to averaging [~]2.5 repetitions of the data in terms of image similarity, and 1.6-2.2 repetitions in terms of the cortical surface placement accuracy. The scan-rescan precision of the cortical surface positioning and thickness estimation was lower than 170 m. Our unique dataset and systematic characterization support the use of denoising methods for improved cortical surface reconstruction sub-millimeter resolution.",

    "abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest class of transmembrane proteins, making them an important target for therapeutics. Activation of these receptors is modulated by orthosteric ligands, which stabilize one or several states within a complex conformational ensemble. The intra-and inter-state dynamics, however, is not well documented. Here, we used single-molecule fluorescence to measure ligand-modulated conformational dynamics of the adenosine A2A Receptor (A2AR) on nanosecond to millisecond timescales. Experiments were performed on detergent-purified A2R in either the ligand-free (apo) state, or when bound to an inverse, partial or full agonist ligand. Single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) was performed on detergent-solubilized A2AR to resolve active and inactive states via the separation between transmembrane (TM) helices 4 and 6. The ligand-dependent changes of the smFRET distributions are consistent with conformational selection and with inter-state exchange lifetimes [&ge;] 3 ms. Local conformational dynamics around residue 229 on TM6 was measured using Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS), which captures dynamic quenching due to photoinduced electron transfer (PET) between a covalently-attached dye and proximal aromatic residues. Global analysis of PET-FCS data revealed fast (150-350 ns), intermediate (50-60 s) and slow (200-300 s) conformational dynamics in A2AR, with lifetimes and amplitudes modulated by ligands and a G-protein mimetic (mini-Gs). Most notably, the agonist binding and the coupling to mini-Gs accelerates and increases the relative contribution of the sub-microsecond phase. Molecular dynamics simulations identified three tyrosine residues (Y112, Y288, and Y290) as being responsible for the dynamic quenching observed by PET-FCS and revealed associated helical motions around residue 229 on TM6. This study provides a quantitative description of conformational dynamics in A2AR and supports the idea that ligands bias not only GPCR conformations but also the dynamics within and between distinct conformational states of the receptor.",

Although each motor domain of dynein contains three active AAA+ ATPases (AAA1, 3, and 4), only the functions of AAA1 and 3 are known. Here, we use single-molecule fluorescence and optical tweezers studies to elucidate the role of AAA4 in dyneins mechanochemical cycle. We demonstrate that AAA4 controls the priming stroke of the motion-generating linker, which connects the dimerizing tail of the motor to the AAA+ ring. Before ATP binds to AAA4, dynein remains incapable of generating motion. However, when AAA4 is bound to ATP, the gating of AAA1 by AAA3 prevails and dynein motion can occur. Thus, AAA1, 3, and 4 work together to regulate dynein function. Our work elucidates an essential role for AAA4 in dyneins stepping cycle and underscores the complexity and crosstalk among the motors multiple AAA+ domains.",

Here, we extended a previously developed three-bead lipid model into a five-bead model and parametrized it for two phospholipids, POPC and DPPC. The developed model, iSoLF, reproduced the area per lipid, hydrophobic thickness, and phase behaviors of the target phospholipid bilayer membranes at the physiological temperature. The model POPC and DPPC membranes were in liquid and gel phases, respectively, in accordance with experiments. We further examined the spontaneous formation of a membrane bilayer, the temperature dependence of physical properties, vesicle dynamics, and the POPC/DPPC two-component membrane dynamics of the CG lipid model, showing some promise. Once combined with standard C protein models, the iSoLF model will be a powerful tool to simulate large biological membrane systems made of lipids and proteins.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGlioblastoma (GBM) is marked by cellular heterogeneity, including metabolic heterogeneity, that varies among cellular microenvironments in the same tumor. Altered cellular metabolism in cancer is well-established, but how lipid metabolism is altered to suit different microenvironmental conditions and cellular states within a tumor remains unexplored.\n\nMethodsWe assessed GBM organoid models that mimic the transition zone between nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor pseudopalisading/perinecrotic tumor zones and performed spatial RNA-sequencing of cells to interrogate lipid metabolism. Using targeted lipidomic analysis, we assessed differences in acutely enriched cancer stem cells (CSCs) and non-CSCs from multiple patient-derived models to explore the link between the stem cell state and lipid metabolism.\n\nResultsSpatial analysis revealed a striking difference in lipid content between microenvironments, with lipid enrichment in the hypoxic organoid cores and the perinecrotic and pseudopalisading regions of primary patient tumors. This was accompanied by regionally restricted upregulation of hypoxia-inducible lipid droplet-associated (HILPDA) gene expression in organoid cores and in clinical GBM specimens, but not lower-grade brain tumors, that was specifically localized to pseudopalisading regions of patient tumors. CSCs have low lipid droplet accumulation compared to non-CSCs in organoid models and xenograft tumors, and prospectively sorted lipid-low GBM cells are functionally enriched for stem cell activity. Targeted lipidomic analysis revealed that CSCs had decreased levels of major classes of neutral lipids compared to non-CSCs but had significantly increased polyunsaturated fatty acid production due to high fatty acid desaturase (FADS1/2) expression.\n\nConclusionsOur data demonstrate that lipid metabolism is differentially altered across GBM microenvironments and cellular hierarchies, providing guidance for targeting of these altered lipid metabolic pathways.\n\nKey pointsO_LIGBM cells in nutrient-poor tumor regions have increased accumulation of lipid droplets.\nC_LIO_LICSCs have reduced lipid content compared to non-CSCs.\nC_LIO_LIGBM CSCs and non-CSCs have disparate lipid metabolisms that may be uniquely targetable.\nC_LI\n\nImportance of the StudyMetabolic targeting has long been advocated as a therapy against many tumors including GBM, and it remains an outstanding question whether cancer stem cells (CSCs) have altered lipid metabolism. We demonstrated striking differences in lipid metabolism between diverse cell populations from the same patient. These spatially and phenotypically distinct lipid phenotypes occur clinically in the majority of patients and can be recapitulated in laboratory models. Lipidomic analysis of multiple patient-derived models shows a significant shift in lipid metabolism between GBM CSCs and non-CSCs, suggesting that lipid levels may not be simply a product of the microenvironment but also may be a reflection of cellular state. Our results suggest that therapeutic targeting of GBM lipid metabolism must consider multiple separate tumor cell populations to be effective, and we provide a methodologic framework for studying these metabolically diverse cellular populations.",

    "abstract": "Rho GTPase signaling promotes proliferation, invasion, and metastasis in a broad spectrum of cancers. Rho GTPase activity is regulated by the Deleted in Liver Cancer (DLC) family of bonafide tumor suppressors which directly inactivate Rho GTPases by stimulating GTP hydrolysis. In addition to a RhoGAP domain, DLC proteins contain a StAR-related lipid transfer (START) domain. START domains in other organisms bind hydrophobic small molecules and can regulate interacting partners or co-occurring domains through a variety of mechanisms. In the case of DLC proteins, their START domain appears to contribute to tumor suppressive activity. However, the nature of this START-directed mechanism, as well as the identities of relevant functional residues, remain virtually unknown. Using the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) dataset, and evolutionary and structure-function analyses, we identify several conserved residues likely to be required for START-directed regulation of DLC-1 and DLC-2 tumor suppressive capability. This pan-cancer analysis shows that conserved residues of both START domains are highly-overrepresented in cancer cells from a wide range tissues. Interestingly, in DLC-1 and DLC-2, three of these residues form multiple interactions at the tertiary structural level. Further, mutation of any of these residues is predicted to disrupt interactions and thus destabilize the START domain. As such, these mutations would not have emerged from traditional hotspot scans of COSMIC. We propose that evolutionary and structure-function analyses are an underutilized strategy which could be used to unmask cancer-relevant mutations within COSMIC. Our data also suggest DLC-1 and DLC-2 as high- priority candidates for development of novel therapeutics targeting their START domain.\n\nSimple SummaryDeleted in Liver Cancer (DLC) proteins are tumor suppressors that contain a StAR-related lipid transfer (START) domain. Little is known about the DLC START domain including the residues that mediate its activation. Using the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) dataset, evolutionary, and structure-function analyses, we identify key functional residues of DLC START domains. Mutations in these residues are significantly overrepresented in numerous cancers in multiple tissue types. In other contexts, START domains bind hydrophobic small molecules and stimulate regulatory outputs of interacting partners or co-occurring domains. The identification of functional residues in the DLC START domain may thus have implications for targeted manipulation of DLC tumor suppressive activity. Critically, these residues would not have been identified using traditional queries of COSMIC. Thus, we propose tandem evolutionary and structure-function approaches are an underutilized strategy to unmask cancer-relevant mutations within COSMIC.",

    "abstract": "Single cell transcriptomics is revolutionizing our understanding of development and response to environmental cues1-3. Recent advances in single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology have enabled profiling gene expression pattern of heterogenous tissues and organs at single cellular level and have been widely applied in human and animal research4,5. Nevertheless, the existence of cell walls significantly encumbered its application in plant research. Protoplasts have been applied for scRNA-seq analysis, but mostly restricted to tissues amenable for wall digestion, such as root tips6-10. However, many cell types are resistant to protoplasting, and protoplasting may yield ectopic gene expression and bias proportions of cell types. Here we demonstrate a method with minimal artifacts for high-throughput single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-Seq) that we use to profile tomato shoot apex cells. The obtained high-resolution expression atlas identifies numerous distinct cell types covering major shoot tissues and developmental stages, delineates developmental trajectories of mesophyll cells, vasculature cells, epidermal cells, and trichome cells. In addition, we identify key developmental regulators and reveal their hierarchy. Collectively, this study demonstrates the power of snRNA-seq to plant research and provides an unprecedented spatiotemporal gene expression atlas of heterogeneous shoot cells.",

    "abstract": "Humans can seamlessly combine value signals from diverse motivational incentives, yet it is not well-understood how these signals are \"bundled\" in the brain to modulate cognitive control. The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) is theorized to integrate motivational value dimensions in the service of goal-directed action, though this hypothesis has yet to receive rigorous confirmation. In the present study, we examined the role of human dACC in motivational incentive integration. Healthy young adult men and women were scanned with fMRI while engaged in an experimental paradigm that quantifies the combined effects of liquid (e.g., juice, neutral, saltwater) and monetary incentives on cognitive task performance. Monetary incentives modulated trial-by-trial dACC activation, whereas block-related effects of liquid incentives on dACC activity were observed. When bundled together, incentive-related dACC modulation predicted fluctuations in both cognitive performance and self-report motivation ratings. Statistical mediation analyses suggest that dACC encoded the incentives in terms of their integrated subjective motivational value, and that this value signal was most proximally associated with task performance. Finally, we confirmed that these incentive integration effects were selectively present in dACC. Together, the results support an account in which dACC integrates motivational signals to compute the expected value of goal-directed cognitive control.\n\nSignificance StatementHow are primary and secondary incentives integrated in the brain to influence goal-directed behavior? Using an innovative experimental fMRI paradigm that combines motivational incentives that have historically been studied independently between species (e.g., monetary rewards for humans, food rewards for animals), we examine the relationship between incentive motivational value and cognitive control allocation. We find evidence that the integrated incentive motivational value of combined incentives is encoded in human dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Further, self-reported motivational shifts mediated the effects of incentive-modulated dACC activity on task performance, revealing convergence in how self-reported and experimentally-induced motivation are encoded in the human brain. Our findings may inform future translational studies examining affective/motivational and cognitive impairments in psychopathology (e.g., anxiety, depression, addiction).",

    "abstract": "The thalamus is a key element of sensory transmission in the brain, as all sensory information is processed by the thalamus before reaching the cortex. The thalamus is known to gate and select sensory streams through a modulation of its internal activity in which spindle oscillations play a preponderant role, but the mechanism underlying this process is not completely understood. In particular, how do thalamocortical connections convey stimulus-driven information selectively over the background of thalamic internally generated activity (such as spindle oscillations)? Here we investigate this issue with a spiking network model of connectivity between thalamus and primary sensory cortex reproducing the local field potential of both areas. We found two features of the thalamocortical dynamics that filter out spindle oscillations: i) spindle oscillations are weaker in neurons projecting to the cortex, ii) the resonance dynamics of cortical networks selectively blocks frequency in the range encompassing spindle oscillations. This latter mechanism depends on the balance of the strength of thalamocortical connections toward excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the cortex. Our results pave the way toward an integrated understanding of the sensory streams traveling between the periphery and the cortex.",

    "abstract": "A forest fire in a cool-temperate broad-leaved forest in northern Japan, from 26 May to 19 June 2019, provided an opportunity to examine its effects on young and dense birch (Betula ermanii Cham.) stands in soil scarification sites. To characterise post-fire responses (survival and resprouting) of birch, we set up two plots, 6 months post fire. We investigated trunk diameter at breast height and burn marks on tree trunks (scorch height and charring percentage around the tree bole) of all B. ermanii trees in both plots. Survival and resprouting of each tree were monitored over 2 years (6 and 16 months post fire). To quantify post-fire vegetation recovery in the forest floor, we manually mapped the dominant understory plant, dwarf bamboo (i.e. Sasa kurilensis (Rupr.) Makino et Shibata), from orthomosaic images obtained by an unmanned aircraft vehicle, and estimated the recovery rate in the second year post fire. Additionally, seedlings of woody species were counted in both plots. Size-dependent survival rates of plants in both plots were similar in the first year post fire. All B. ermanii trees died without resprouting in the second year post fire, indicating the lethal effects of fire on young birch trees. Moreover, a high recovery rate of dwarf bamboos over 2 years in both plots and limited seedling establishment of woody plants suggest that the fire resulted in regeneration failure of young stands in the scarification sites. On the basis of these findings, we propose future management of stands in soil scarification sites post fire, considering the vulnerability of young trees and the rapid change in vegetation from young forest to dense birch cover post fire.",

    "abstract": "The plant family Balanophoraceae consists entirely of species that have lost the ability to photosynthesize. Instead, they obtain nutrients by parasitizing other plants. Recent studies have shown that plastid genomes of Balanophoraceae have a number of interesting features, one of the most prominent of those being a tremendous AT content close to 90%. Also, the nucleotide substitution rate in the plastid genomes of Balanophoraceae is greater by an order of magnitude compared to photosynthetic relatives, without signs of relaxed selection. All these features have no definite explanations.\n\nGiven these unusual features, we supposed that it would be interesting to gain insight into the characteristics of nuclear genomes of Balanophoraceae. To do this, in the present study we analysed transcriptomes of two species from Balanophoraceae, namely Rhopalocnemis phalloides and Balanophora fungosa, and compared them with transcriptomes of their close photosynthetic relatives Daenikera sp., Dendropemon caribaeus, Malania oleifera.\n\nThe analysis showed that the AT content of nuclear genes of Balanophoraceae does not markedly differ from that of photosynthetic relatives. The nucleotide substitution rate in genes of Balanophoraceae is for an unknown reason several times larger than in genes of photosynthetic Santalales, though the negative selection in Balanophoraceae is likely stronger.\n\nWe observed an extensive loss of photosynthesis-related genes in Balanophoraceae. Also, for Balanophoraceae we did not see transcripts of several genes whose products participate in plastid genome repair. This implies their loss or very low expression, which may explain the increased nucleotide substitution rate and AT content of the plastid genomes.",
