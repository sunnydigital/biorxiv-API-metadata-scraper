    "abstract": "Sleep is essential for the survival of most living beings. Numerous researchers have identified a series of genes that are thought to regulate \"sleep-state\" or the \"deprived state\". As sleep has significant effect on physiology, we believe that lack of sleep or particularly REM sleep for a prolonged period would have a profound impact on various body tissues. Therefore, using microarray method, we sought to determine which genes and processes are affected in the brain and liver of rats following 9 days of REM sleep deprivation. Our findings showed that REM sleep deprivation affected a total of 652 genes in the brain and 426 genes in the liver. Only 23 genes were affected commonly, 10 oppositely and 13 similarly across brain and liver tissue. Our results suggest that 9-day REM sleep deprivation differentially affects genes and processes in the brain and liver of rats.\n\nHighlights of the study[tpltrtarr] Gene expression profile of brain and liver tissues of rats was analyzed using microarray technique following 9 days of REM Sleep deprivation.\n[tpltrtarr]Many of the genes involved in essential physiological processes, such as protein synthesis and neuronal metabolism are affected differently in the brain and liver tissue of rats after 9-day REM sleep deprivation.",

    "abstract": "During viral infection, the numbers of virions infecting individual cells can vary significantly over time and space. The functional consequences of this variation in cellular multiplicity of infection (MOI) remain poorly understood. Here, we rigorously quantify the phenotypic consequences of cellular MOI during influenza A virus (IAV) infection over a single round of replication in terms of cell death rates, viral output kinetics, interferon and antiviral effector gene transcription, and superinfection potential. By statistically fitting mathematical models to our data, we precisely define specific functional forms that quantitatively describe the modulation of these phenotypes by MOI at the single cell level. To determine the generality of these functional forms, we compare two distinct cell lines (MDCK cells and A549 cells), both infected with the H1N1 strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8). We find that a model assuming that infected cell death rates are independent of cellular MOI best fits the experimental data in both cell lines. We further observe that a model in which the rate and efficiency of virus production increase with cellular co-infection best fits our observations in MDCK cells, but not in A549 cells. In A549 cells, we also find that induction of type III interferon, but not type I interferon, is highly dependent on cellular MOI, especially at early timepoints. This finding identifies a role for cellular co-infection in shaping the innate immune response to IAV infection. Finally, we show that higher cellular MOI is associated with more potent superinfection exclusion, thus limiting the total number of virions capable of infecting a cell. Overall, this study suggests that the extent of cellular co-infection by influenza viruses may be a critical determinant of both viral production kinetics and cellular infection outcomes in a host cell type-dependent manner.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYDuring influenza A virus (IAV) infection, the number of virions to enter individual cells can be highly variable. Cellular co-infection appears to be common and plays an essential role in facilitating reassortment for IAV, yet little is known about how cellular co-infection influences infection outcomes at the cellular level. Here, we combine quantitative in vitro infection experiments with statistical model fitting to precisely define the phenotypic consequences of cellular co-infection in two cell lines. We reveal that cellular co-infection can increase and accelerate the efficiency of IAV production in a cell line-dependent fashion, identifying it as a potential determinant of viral replication kinetics. We also show that induction of type III, but not type I, interferon is highly dependent upon the number of virions that infect a given cell, implicating cellular co-infection as an important determinant of the host innate immune response to infection. Altogether, our findings show that cellular co-infection plays a crucial role in determining infection outcome. The integration of experimental and statistical modeling approaches detailed here represents a significant advance in the quantitative study of influenza virus infection and should aid ongoing efforts focused on the construction of mathematical models of IAV infection.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY PARAGRAPHPiezo1 is a mechanosensitive channel involved in many cellular functions and responsible for sensing shear-stress and pressure forces in cells1-3. Piezo1 plays a critical role in the circulatory system and tissue development. Mutations on Piezo1 are linked to human diseases such as lymphedema2,4 or hematological disorders such as hemolytic anaemia5 and resistance to malaria6. Hypotheses for Piezo1 gating include the \"force-from-lipids\" principle7,8 that suggests that Piezo1 senses mechanical forces through the bilayer1,9 and a direct involvement of the cytoskeleton as well as the extracellular matrix in Piezo1 activation10,11. However, the molecular and structural changes underpinning the Piezo1 gating mechanism and how the channel senses forces in the membrane remain unknown. Here we reveal the activation mechanism of Piezo1 and the structural rearrangements that occur when Piezo1 moves from a closed to an open state when mechanical tension is applied to the cell membrane. Our results show that Piezo1s curved shape is stable in a native-like model membrane without tension creating a membrane indentation with a trilobed topology. Upon stretching Piezo1 adapts to the stretched bilayer by flattening and expansion of its blade region. In our simulations Piezo1 expands up to a planar circular area of [~]680 nm2 comparable with previous structural data and hypotheses12-14. Piezo1 flattening and expansion results in changes in the beam helix tilt angle. These movements result in the tilting and lateral movement of the pore lining TM37 and TM38 helices. This leads to the opening of the channel and to the movement of lipids that occupy Piezo1 pore region outside of this region, revealing for the first time the structural changes that happen during Piezo1 mechanical activation. The changes in the blade region are transmitted to helices TM37 and 38 via hydrophobic interactions and by interactions of neighbouring subunits via the elbow region. The flat structure of Piezo1 identified in this study exposes the C-terminal extracellular domain (CED) that in the closed state is hidden in the membrane and presumably from shear stress. Our results provide new structural data for different states of Piezo1 and suggest the molecular principles by which mechanical force opens the Piezo1 channel, thus coupling force to physiological effect via ion permeation.",

    "abstract": "What determines genetic diversity and how it connects to the various biological traits is unknown. In this work, we offer answers to these questions. By comparing genetic variation of 14,671 mammalian gene trees with thousands of individual genomes of human, chimpanzee, gorilla, mouse and dog/wolf, we found that intraspecific genetic diversity is determined by long-term molecular evolutionary rates, rather than de novo mutation rates. This relationship was established during the early stage of mammalian evolution. Expanding this new finding, we developed a method to detect fluctuations of species-specific selection on genes as the deviations of intra-species genetic diversity predicted from long-term rates. We show that the evolution of epithelial cells, rather than of connective tissue, mainly contributes to morphological evolution of different species. For humans, evolution of the immune system and selective sweeps subjected by infectious diseases are most representative of adaptive evolution.",

    "abstract": "To adapt to their environments, animals must generate behaviors that are closely aligned to a rapidly changing sensory world. However, behavioral states such as foraging or courtship typically persist over long time scales to ensure proper execution. It remains unclear how neural circuits generate persistent behavioral states while maintaining the flexibility to select among alternative states when the sensory context changes. Here, we elucidate the functional architecture of a neural circuit controlling the choice between roaming and dwelling states, which underlie exploration and exploitation during foraging in C. elegans. By imaging ensemble-level neural activity in freely-moving animals, we identify stable, circuit-wide activity patterns corresponding to each behavioral state. Combining circuit-wide imaging with genetic analysis, we find that mutual inhibition between two antagonistic neuromodulatory systems underlies the persistence and mutual exclusivity of the opposing network states. Through machine learning analysis and circuit perturbations, we identify a sensory processing neuron that can transmit information about food odors to both the roaming and dwelling circuits and bias the animal towards different states in different sensory contexts, giving rise to context-appropriate state transitions. Our findings reveal a potentially general circuit architecture that enables flexible, sensory-driven control of persistent behavioral states.",

    "abstract": "Synchronization is a collective mechanism by which oscillatory networks achieve their functions. Factors driving synchronization include the networks topological and dynamical properties. However, how these factors drive the emergence of synchronization in the presence of potentially disruptive external inputs like stochastic perturbations is not well understood, particularly for real-world systems such as the human brain. Here, we aim to systematically address this problem using a large-scale model of the human brain network (i.e., the human connectome). The results show that the model can produce complex synchronization patterns transitioning between incoherent and coherent states. When nodes in the network are coupled at some critical strength, a counterintuitive phenomenon emerges where the addition of noise increases the synchronization of global and local dynamics, with structural hub nodes benefiting the most. This stochastic synchronization effect is found to be driven by the intrinsic hierarchy of neural timescales of the brain and the heterogeneous complex topology of the connectome. Moreover, the effect coincides with clustering of node phases and node frequencies and strengthening of the functional connectivity of some of the connectomes subnetworks. Overall, the work provides broad theoretical insights into the emergence and mechanisms of stochastic synchronization, highlighting its putative contribution in achieving network integration underpinning brain function.",

    "abstract": "In our everyday behavior, we frequently cancel one movement while continuing others. Two competing models have been suggested for the cancellation of such specific actions: 1) the abrupt engagement of a unitary global inhibitory mechanism followed by reinitiation of the continuing actions, or 2) a balance between distinct global and selective inhibitory mechanisms. To evaluate these models, we examined behavioral and physiological markers of proactive control, motor preparation, and response inhibition using a combination of behavioral task performance measures, electromyography, electroencephalography, and motor evoked potentials elicited with transcranial magnetic stimulation. Healthy participants performed two versions of a stop signal task with cues incorporating proactive control: A unimanual task involving the initiation and inhibition of a single response, and a bimanual task involving the selective stopping of one of two prepared responses. Stopping latencies, motor evoked potentials, and frontal beta power (13-20 Hz) did not differ between the uni- and bimanual tasks. However, evidence for selective proactive control before stopping was manifest in the bimanual condition as changes in corticomotor excitability, mu (9-14 Hz), and beta (15-25 Hz) oscillations over sensorimotor cortex. Altogether, our results favor the recruitment of a single inhibitory stopping mechanism with the net behavioral output depending on the levels of action-specific motor preparation.\n\nSignificance statementResponse inhibition is a core function of cognitive flexibility and movement control. Previous research has suggested separate mechanisms for selective and global inhibition, yet the evidence is inconclusive. Another line of research has examined the influence of preparation for action stopping, or what is called proactive control, on stopping performance, yet the neural mechanisms underlying this interaction are unknown. We combined transcranial magnetic stimulation, electroencephalography, electromyography and behavioral measures to compare selective and global inhibition models and to investigate markers of proactive control. The results favor a single inhibitory mechanism over separate selective and global mechanisms, but indicate a vital role for preceding motor activity in determining whether and which actions will be stopped.",

Hydrophobic interactions drive promiscuous chaperone-client binding, but our understanding how additional interactions enable client specificity is sparse.

Combining NMR, SAXS and molecular dynamics simulations, we determine the structures of Tim23/TIM8{middle dot}13 and Tim23/TIM9{middle dot}10 complexes. TIM8{middle dot}13 uses transient salt bridges to interact with the hydrophilic part of its client, but its interactions to the trans-membrane part are weaker than in TIM9{middle dot}10. Consequently, TIM9{middle dot}10 is outcompeting TIM8{middle dot}13 in binding hydrophobic clients, while TIM8{middle dot}13 is tuned to few clients with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts.

    "abstract": "Meiosis in female oocytes lack centrosomes, the major microtubule-organizing center, which makes them especially vulnerable to aneuploidy. In the acentrosomal oocytes of Drosophila, meiotic spindle assembly depends on the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC). Aurora B is the catalytic component of the CPC while the remaining subunits regulate its localization. Using an inhibitor of Aurora B activity, Binucleine 2, we found that continuous Aurora B activity is required to maintain the oocyte spindle during meiosis I, and this activity is antagonized by phosphatases acting on spindle associated proteins such as kinesins. Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) exists in two varieties, B55 and B56. While both antagonize Aurora B, B55 has only minor roles in meiosis I spindle function. The B56 subunit is encoded by two partially redundant paralogs in the Drosophila genome, wdb and wrd. Knocking down both paralogs showed that the B56 subunit is critical for maintaining sister chromatid cohesion, establishing end-on microtubule attachments, and the metaphase I arrest in oocytes. We found that WDB recruitment to the centromeres depends on BUBR1, MEI-S332, and kinetochore protein SPC105R. While BUBR1 has been shown previously to stabilize microtubule attachments in Drosophila oocytes, only SPC105R is required for cohesion maintenance during meiosis I. We propose that SPC105R promotes cohesion maintenance by recruiting two proteins that recruit PP2A, MEI-S332, and the Soronin homolog Dalmatian.",

    "abstract": "The N protein of betacoronaviruses is responsible for nucleocapsid assembly and other essential regulatory functions. Its N-terminal domain (NTD) interacts and melts the double-stranded transcriptional regulatory sequences (dsTRS), regulating the discontinuous subgenome transcription process. Here, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the binding of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD to non-specific (NS) and TRS dsRNAs. We probed dsRNAs Watson and Crick (WC) base-pairing over 25 replicas of 100 ns MD simulations, showing that only one N-NTD of dimeric N is enough to destabilize dsRNAs, initiating melting. N-NTD dsRNA destabilizing activity was more efficient for dsTRS than dsNS. N-NTD dynamics, especially a tweezer-like motion of {beta}2-{beta}3 and 2-{beta}5 loops, played a key role in WC base-pairing destabilization. Based on experimental information available in the literature, we constructed kinetics models for N-NTD-mediated dsRNA melting. Our results support a 1:1 stoichiometry (N-NTD:dsRNA), matching MD simulations and raising different possibilities for N-NTD action: (i) two N-NTDs of dimeric N would act independently, increasing efficiency; (ii) two N-NTDs of dimeric N would bind to two different RNA sites, bridging distant regions of the genome; and (iii) monomeric N would be active, opening up the possibility of a regulatory dissociation event.\n\nIMPORTANCECoronaviruses are among the largest positive-sense RNA viruses. They display a unique discontinous transcription mechanism, involving N protein as a major player. The N-NTD promote the dsRNA melting releasing the nascent sense negative strand via a poorly known mechanism of action. It specifically recognizes the body TRS conserved RNA motif located at the 5 end of each ORF. N protein has the ability to transfer the nascent RNA strand to the leader TRS. The mechanism is essential and one single mutation at the RNA binding site of the N-NTD impairs the viral replication. Here, we describe a counterintuitive mechanism of action of N-NTD based on molecular dynamics simulation and kinetic modelling of the experimental melting activity of N-NTD. This data impacts directly in the understanding of the way N protein acts in the cell and will guide future experiments.",

    "abstract": "Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is widely used to treat drug-resistant epilepsy and depression. While the precise mechanisms mediating its long-term therapeutic effects are not fully resolved, they likely involve locus coeruleus (LC) stimulation via the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), which receives afferent vagal inputs. In rats, VNS elevates LC firing and forebrain noradrenaline levels, whereas LC lesions suppress VNS therapeutic efficacy. Non-invasive transcutaneous VNS (tVNS) employs electrical stimulation that targets the auricular branch of the vagus nerve at the cymba conchae of the ear. However, the extent that tVNS mimics VNS remains unclear. Here, we investigated the short-term effects of tVNS in healthy human male volunteers (n=24), using high-density EEG and pupillometry during visual fixation at rest. We compared short (3.4s) trials of tVNS to sham electrical stimulation at the earlobe (far from the vagus nerve branch) to control for somatosensory stimulation. Although tVNS and sham stimulation did not differ in subjective intensity ratings, tVNS led to robust pupil dilation (peaking 4-5s after trial onset) that was significantly higher than following sham stimulation. We further quantified, using parallel factor analysis, how tVNS modulates idle occipital alpha (8-13Hz) activity identified in each participant. We found greater attenuation of alpha oscillations by tVNS than by sham stimulation. This demonstrates that tVNS reliably induces pupillary and EEG markers of arousal beyond the effects of somatosensory stimulation, thus supporting the hypothesis that tVNS elevates noradrenaline and other arousal-promoting neuromodulatory signaling, and mimics invasive VNS.\n\nSignificance statementCurrent non-invasive brain stimulation techniques are mostly confined to modulating cortical activity, as is typical with transcranial magnetic or transcranial direct/alternating-current electrical stimulation. Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) has been proposed to stimulate subcortical arousal-promoting nuclei, though previous studies yielded inconsistent results. Here we show that short (3.4s) tVNS pulses in naive healthy male volunteers induced transient pupil dilation and attenuation of occipital alpha oscillations. These markers of brain arousal are in line with the established effects of invasive VNS on locus coeruleus-noradrenaline signaling, and support the notion that tVNS mimics VNS. Therefore, tVNS can be used as a tool for studying the means by which endogenous subcortical neuromodulatory signaling affects human cognition, including perception, attention, memory, and decision-making; and also for developing novel clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "For the yeast population and diversity, marine habitats are the least explored niches and the lack of validated database is considered to be a drawback for yeast research. The aim of the present study is to create a comprehensive DNA barcode library for marine derived yeast species isolated from organic burial hotspots such as coastal sediment in mangrove and continental shelf ecosystems. As we enriched, isolated and ITS gene sequenced 1017 marine derived yeast isolates belonging to 157 marine species in 55 genera, 28 families, 14 orders, 8 classes of 2 Phyla (viz., Ascomycota and Basidiomycota) of which 13 yeast species were first time barcoded. We witnessed yeast species of both terrestrial and marine endemic origin in the barcode datasets. Due to the large volume of sequencing trace files, the variable length of extracted sequences, and the lack of reference sequences in public databases, difficulties were faced in taxonomic sequence validation. The length of the majority of the sequences (99.42%) were more than or equal to 600 base pairs. BLAST analysis revealed that 13 yeast species were barcoded for the first time. The genus, Candida was the speciose genera isolated in this study. K2P intra-species distance analysis performed for selective groups yielded an average of 0.33%, well below the previously proposed yeast barcode gap. ITS gene NJ-tree based identification conducted for selective species in Ascomycota and Basidomycota, precisely clustered the same species into one group, indicating the efficacy of ITS gene in yeast species delineation. Besides isolating some of the common marine yeast species such as Candida oceani, Bandonia marina and Yarrowia lipolytica, we found approximately 60% of the yeast species isolates were previously unrecorded from the marine environment (example; Cystobasidiopsis lactophilus, Slooffia cresolica, Udeniozyma ferulica, Colacogloea falcatus and Pichia guilliermondii), of which 16.5% were recognised as potential human pathogens (example; Candida orthopsilosis, C. rugosa, Debaryomyces fabryi and Yamadazyma triangularis). Apart from releasing the barcode data in GenBank, provisions were made to access the entire dataset along with meta-data in the Barcode of life database (http://dx.doi.org/10.5883/DS-MYIC). This research constitutes the largest dataset to date for collecting marine yeast isolates and their barcodes. As meta- and environmental barcoding analysis were expanding its scope including environmental assessment and monitoring, the datasets such as ours will be more useful.",

    "abstract": "Body size and the timing of metamorphosis are two important interlinked life-history traits that define holometabolous insect development. Metamorphic timing is largely controlled by a neuroendocrine signaling axis composed of the prothoracic gland (PG) and its presynaptic neurons (PGNs). The PGNs produce prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) that stimulates the PG to produce the metamorphosis inducing hormone ecdysone (E) through activation of Torso a Receptor tyrosine kinase the Receptor Tyrosine kinase and its downstream Ras/Erk signal transducers. Here we identify two additional timing signals produced by the RTKs Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (Alk) and the PDGF/VEGF-receptor related (PvR), Similar to Torso, both Alk and PvR trigger Ras/Erk signaling in the PG to up regulate expression of E biosynthetic enzymes, while Alk also suppresses autophagy induction after critical weight by activating Pi3K/Akt. When overexpressed, both RTKs hyperactivate an endogenous low-level Jak/Stat signal in the PG resulting in developmental delay or arrest. The Alk ligand Jelly belly (Jeb) is produced by the PGNs, and together with PTTH serves as a second PGN derived tropic factor that stimulates E production by the PG. In addition, we find that Pvf3, a PvR ligand, is also produced by the PGNs, but we show that the activation of PvR primarily relies on autocrine signaling by PG-derived Pvf2 and Pvf3. These findings illustrate that a multitude of juxtracrine and autocrine signaling systems have evolved to regulate the timing of metamorphosis, the defining event of holometabolous development.",

    "abstract": "Optogenetic protein dimerization systems are powerful tools to investigate the biochemical networks that cells use to make decisions and coordinate their activities. These tools, including the improved Light-Inducible Dimer (iLID) system, offer the ability to selectively recruit components to subcellular locations, such as micron-scale regions of the plasma membrane. In this way, the role of individual proteins within signaling networks can be examined with high spatiotemporal resolution. Currently, consistent recruitment is limited by heterogeneous optogenetic component expression, and spatial precision is diminished by protein diffusion, especially over long timescales. Here, we address these challenges within the iLID system with alternative membrane anchoring domains and fusion configurations. Using live cell imaging and mathematical modeling, we demonstrate that the anchoring strategy affects both component expression and diffusion, which in turn impact recruitment strength, kinetics, and spatial dynamics. Compared to the commonly used C-terminal iLID fusion, fusion proteins with large N-terminal anchors show stronger local recruitment, slower diffusion of recruited components, and efficient recruitment over wider gene expression ranges. We also define guidelines for component expression regimes for optimal recruitment for both cell-wide and subcellular recruitment strategies. Our findings highlight key sources of imprecision within light-inducible dimer systems and provide tools that allow greater control of subcellular protein localization across diverse cell biological applications.\n\nSignificanceOptogenetic light-inducible dimer systems, such as iLID, offer the ability to examine cellular signaling networks on second timescales and micrometer spatial scales. Confined light stimulation can recruit proteins to subcellular regions of the plasma membrane, and local signaling effects can be observed. Here, we report alternative iLID fusion proteins that display stronger and more spatially confined membrane recruitment. We also define optogenetic component expression regimes for optimal recruitment and show that slow-diffusing iLID proteins allow more robust recruitment in cell populations with heterogenous expression. These tools should improve the spatiotemporal control and reproducibility of optogenetic protein recruitment to the plasma membrane.",

    "abstract": "In adults, the synchronised interplay of sleep spindles (SP) and slow oscillations (SO) supports memory consolidation. Given tremendous developmental changes in SP and SO morphology, it remains elusive whether across childhood the same mechanisms as identified in adults are functional. Based on topography and frequency, we characterise slow and fast SPs and their temporal coupling to SOs in 24 pre-school children. Further, we ask whether slow and fast SPs and their modulation during SOs are associated with behavioural indicators of declarative memory consolidation as suggested by the literature on adults. Employing an individually tailored approach, we reliably identify an inherent, development-specific fast centro-parietal SP type, nested in the adult-like slow SP frequency range, along with a dominant slow frontal SP type. Further, we provide evidence that the modulation of fast centro-parietal SPs during SOs is already present in pre-school children. However, the temporal coordination between fast centro-parietal SPs and SOs is weaker and less precise than expected from research on adults. While we do not find evidence for a critical contribution of SP-SO coupling for memory consolidation, crucially, slow frontal and fast centro-parietal SPs are each differentially related to sleep-associated consolidation of items of varying quality. While a higher number of slow frontal SPs is associated with stronger maintenance of medium-quality memories, a higher number of fast centro-parietal SPs is linked to a greater gain of low-quality items. Our results demonstrate two functionally relevant inherent SP types in pre-school children although SP-SO coupling is not yet fully mature.",

    "abstract": "A large part of a plants developmental plasticity relies on the activities of the phytohormone auxin and the regulation of its own distribution. This process involves a cohort of transcriptional and non-transcriptional effects of auxin on polar auxin transport, regulating the abundancy, biochemical activity and polar localization of the molecular components, predominantly PIN auxin exporters. While the transcriptional auxin signaling cascade has been well characterized, the mechanism and role of non-transcriptional auxin signaling remains largely elusive. Here, we addressed the potential involvement of auxin-induced Ca2+ signaling in auxins inhibitory effect on PIN endocytic trafficking. On the one hand, exogenous manipulations of Ca2+ availability and signaling effectively antagonized auxin effects suggesting that auxin-induced Ca2+ signaling is required for inhibition of internalization. On the other hand, we addressed the auxin-mediated inhibition of PIN internalization in the auxin signaling (tir1afb2,3) or Ca2+ channel (cngc14) mutants. These mutants were strongly defective in auxin-triggered Ca2+ signaling, but not in auxin-inhibited internalization. These data imply that, while Ca2+ signaling may be required for normal PIN trafficking, auxin-mediated increase in Ca2+ signaling is not a direct part of a downstream mechanism that mediates auxin effects on Brefeldin A-visualized PIN intercellular aggregation. These contrasting results obtained by comparing the mutant analysis versus the exogenous manipulations of Ca2+ availability and signaling illustrate the critical importance of genetics to unravel the role of Ca2+ in a process of interest.",

    "abstract": "Fyn is a Src kinase that controls critical signalling cascades and its postsynaptic enrichment underpins synaptotoxicity in Alzheimers disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTLD-tau). Previously, we found that pathogenic FTLD tau mutant (P301L) expression promotes aberrant trapping of Fyn in nanoclusters within hippocampal dendrites via an unknown mechanism (Padmanabhan et al., 2019). Here, we imaged Fyn-mEos2 using single particle tracking photoactivated localization microscopy (sptPALM) to demonstrate that nanoclustering of Fyn in hippocampal dendrites is promoted by Fyns open, primed conformation. Disrupting the auto-inhibitory, closed conformation of Fyn through phospho-inhibition, and perturbation of Fyns SH3 domain increases, Fyns nanoscale trapping. However, inhibition of Fyns catalytic domain has no impact on its mobility. Tau-P301L promotes Fyn lateral trapping via Fyn opening and ensuing increased catalytic activation. Pathogenic tau may therefore drive synaptotoxicity by locking Fyn in an open, catalytically active conformation, leading to postsynaptic entrapment and aberrant signalling cascades.",

    "abstract": "Herpes simplex viruses (HSV) cause ubiquitous human infections. For vaccine development, knowledge concerning correlates of protection against HSV is essential. Therefore, we investigated if humans principally can produce highly protective cell-to-cell spread inhibiting antibodies upon natural infection and whether such antibody responses correlate with protection from HSV reactivation. We established a high-throughput HSV-1 GFP reporter virus-based assay and screened 2496 human plasma samples for HSV-1 cell-to-cell spread inhibiting antibodies. We conducted a survey among the blood donors to analyze the correlation between the presence of cell-to-cell spread inhibiting antibodies in plasma and the frequency of HSV reactivations. In total, 128 of 2496 blood donors (5.1 %) exhibited high levels of HSV-1 cell-to-cell spread inhibiting antibodies in the plasma. Such individuals showed a significantly lower frequency of HSV reactivations compared to subjects without sufficient levels of HSV-1 cell-to-cell spread inhibiting antibodies. This study provides two important findings: (I) a fraction of humans produce HSV cell-to-cell spread inhibiting antibodies upon natural infection and (II) such antibodies correlate with protection against recurrent HSV. Moreover, these elite neutralizers can provide promising material for hyperimmunoglobulin, the isolation of superior antiviral antibodies and information for the design of a vaccine against HSV.\n\nImportanceHerpes simplex virus 1 infections can cause painful mucosal lesions at the oral or genital tract and severe, life threatening disease in immunosuppressed patients or neonates. There is no approved vaccine available, and the emergence of drug resistances especially in long time treated patients makes the treatment increasingly difficult. We tested 2496 people for HSV-1 cell-to-cell spread inhibiting antibodies. Five percent exhibited functional titers such antibodies and showed significantly lower risk of reactivations, uncovering cell-to-cell spread inhibiting antibodies as a correlate of protection against Herpes simplex virus reactivations. Isolation of the cell-to-cell spread inhibiting antibodies from B-cells of these donors may contribute to develop novel antibody-based interventions for prophylactic and therapeutic use and provide starting material for vaccine development.",

    "abstract": "Stationary phase is the general term for the state a bacterial culture reaches when no further increase in cell number occurs due to the exhaustion of nutrients in the growth medium. Depending on the type of nutrient that is first depleted, the metabolic state of the stationary phase cells may vary greatly, and the subsistence strategies that best support cell survival may differ. As ribosomes play a central role in bacterial growth and energy expenditure, ribosome preservation is a key element of such strategies. To investigate the degree of ribosome preservation during long-term starvation, we compared the dynamics of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) levels of carbon-starved and phosphorus-starved Escherichia coli cultures for up to 28 days. The starved cultures contents of full-length 16S and 23S rRNA decreased exponentially and phosphorus starvation resulted in much more rapid rRNA degradation than carbon starvation. Bacterial survival kinetics were also quantified over the starvation period. Upon replenishment of the nutrient in question, carbon-starved cells resumed growth faster than cells starved for phosphate for the equivalent amount of time, and for both conditions, the lag time increased with the starvation time. While these results are in accordance with the hypothesis that cells with a larger ribosome pool recover more readily upon replenishment of nutrients, we also observed that the lag time kept increasing with increasing starvation time, also when the amount of rRNA per viable cell remained constant.\n\nImportanceBacteria grow exponentially consuming nutrients, and then starve until the next nutrient is added. To elucidate the survival kinetics of the cells under starvation, we performed month-long, carbon and phosphorus starvation experiments of Escherichia coli monitoring ribosomal RNA levels and survival of the cells. The starved cultures concentration of ribosomal RNA dropped exponentially with time, and the speed of degradation was much quicker under the phosphorus starvation than the carbon starvation. We have also quantified the lag time, i.e., the time needed to resume growth when the starved cells are transferred into fresh media. The observation revealed that the lag time increases with starvation time and the phosphorus starvation has a greater impact on the increase of the lag time.",

    "abstract": "Rhizodegradation is a promising cleanup technology where microorganisms degrade soil contaminants in the rhizosphere. A symbiotic relationship is expected to occur between plant roots and soil microorganisms in contaminated soils that enhance natural microbial degradation in soils. However, little is known about how this initial microbiota influences the rhizodegradation outcome in a context of different soil microbiotas. Recent studies have hinted that soil initial diversity has a determining effect on the outcome of contaminant degradation. To test this hypothesis, we planted (P) or not (NP) balsam poplars (Populus balsamifera) in two soils of contrasting diversity (agricultural and forest) that were contaminated or not with 50 mg kg-1 of phenanthrene (PHE). The DNA from the rhizosphere of the P and the bulk soil of the NP pots was extracted and the bacterial genes encoding for the 16S rRNA, the PAH ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase alpha subunits (PAH-RHD) of gram-positive (GP) and gram-negative (GN) bacteria, and the fungal ITS region were sequenced to characterize the microbial communities. and the abundance of the PAH-RHD genes were also quantified by real-time quantitative PCR. Plant presence had a significant effect on PHE degradation only in the forest soil, whereas both NP and P agricultural soils degraded the same amount of PHE. Bacterial communities were principally affected by the soil type, and upon contamination the dominant PAH degrading community was similarly constrained by soil type. Our results highlight the crucial importance of soil microbial and physicochemical characteristics in the outcome of rhizoremediation.",

We selected 3 biopsies of kidney cortex from 3 individuals for scRNA-seq and processed them fresh using an identical protocol on the 10x Chromium platform; (i) HK: native kidney biopsy from a living donor, (ii) AK1: allograft kidney with transplant glomerulopathy, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and worsening graft function, and (iii) AK2: allograft kidney after successful treatment of active antibody-mediated rejection. We did not study T-cell-mediated rejections. We generated 7217 high-quality single cell transcriptomes. Taking advantage of the recipient-donor sex mismatches revealed by X and Y chromosome autosomal gene expression, we determined that in AK1 with fibrosis, 42 months after transplantation, more than half of the kidney allograft fibroblasts were recipient-derived and therefore likely migratory and graft infiltrative, whereas in AK2 without fibrosis, 84 months after transplantation, most fibroblasts were donor-organ-derived. Furthermore, AK1 was enriched for tubular progenitor cells overexpressing profibrotic extracellular matrix genes. AK2, eight months after successful treatment of rejection, contained endothelial cells that expressed T-cell chemoattractant cytokines. In addition to these key findings, our analysis revealed unique cell types and states in the kidney. Altogether, single-cell transcriptomics yielded novel mechanistic insights, which could pave the way for individualizing the care of transplant recipients.",

    "abstract": "The ultimate goal of gene regulation should focus on the protein level. However, as mRNA is an obligate intermediary, and because the amounts of mRNAs and proteins are controlled by their synthesis and degradation rates, the cellular amount of a given protein can be attained following different strategies. By studying omics datasets for six expression variables (mRNA and protein amounts, plus their synthesis and decay rates), we previously demonstrated the existence of common expression strategies (CES) for functionally-related genes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we extend that study to two other eukaryotes: the distantly related yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and cultured human HeLa cells. We also use genomic datasets from the model prokaryote Escherichia coli as an external reference. We show that CES are also present in all the studied organisms and the differences in them between organisms can be used to establish their phylogenetic relationships. The phenogram based on 6VP has the expected topology for the phylogeny of these four organisms, but shows interesting branch length differences to DNA sequence-based trees.\n\nThe analysis of the correlations among the six variables supports that most gene expression control occurs in actively growing organisms at the transcription rate level, and that translation plays a minor role in it. We propose that all living cells use CES for the genes acting on the same physiological pathways, especially for those belonging to stable macromolecular complexes, but CES have been modeled by evolution to adapt to the specific life circumstances of each organism. The obtained phenograms may reflect both evolutionary constraints in expression strategies, and lifestyle convergences.",

    "abstract": "Microtus fortis (M. fortis) so far is the only mammal host that exhibits intrinsic resistance against Schistosoma japonicum infection. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of this intrinsic resistance are not yet known. Here we performed the first de novo genome assembly of M. fortis, comprehensive gene annotation and evolution analysis. Furthermore, we compared the recovery rate of schistosome, pathological change and liver transcriptome between non-permissive host M. fortis and susceptible host mouse at different time points after Schistosome infection. We reveal that Immune response of M. fortis and mouse is different in time and type. M. fortis activates immune and inflammatory responses on the 10th days post infection, involving in multiple pathways, such as leukocyte extravasation, antibody activation (especially IgG3), Fc-gamma receptor mediated phagocytosis, and interferon signaling cascade. The strong immune responses of M. fortis in early stages of infection play important roles in preventing the development of schistosome. On the contrary, intense immune response occurred in mouse in late stages of infection (28~42 days post infection), and cannot eliminate schistosome. Infected mouse suffers severe pathological injury and continuous decrease of important functions such as cell cycle and lipid metabolism. Our findings offer new insights to the intrinsic resistance mechanism of M. fortis against schistosome infection. The genome sequence also provides bases for future studies of other important traits in M. fortis.",

The results indicate that the genomes of the Peruvian SARS-COV-2 samples belong to the genetic groups G and S. Likewise, a phylogenetic and MST analysis of the isolates confirm the introduction of multiple isolates from Europe and Asia that, after border closing, were transmitted locally in the capital and same regions of the country. These Peruvian samples (56%) grouped into two clusters inside G clade and share B.1.1.1 lineage.

Here we investigate the immunogenicity of a range of candidate adenovirusbased vaccines, expressing full or partial sequences of the spike and nucleocapsid proteins, in mice. We demonstrate that, compared to expression of the S1 domain or a stabilized spike antigen, the full length, wild-type spike antigen induces significantly higher neutralizing antibodies in the periphery and in the lungs, when the vaccine is administered mucosally. Antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were induced by this leading vaccine candidate at low and high doses.

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor has been identified as a receptor that mediates the viral entry by binding with the receptor binding motif of spike protein. In the present study, we elucidate the significance of N-terminal domain of spike protein in spike-receptor interactions. Recent clinical reports indicate a link between nCOVID-19 infections with patient comorbidities. The underlying reason behind this relationship is not clear. Using molecular docking, we study the affinity of the nCOVID-19 spike protein with cell receptors overexpressed under disease conditions. Our results suggest that certain cell receptors such as DC/L-SIGN, DPP4, IL22R and ephrin receptors could act as potential receptors for the spike protein. The receptor binding domain of nCOVID-19 is more flexible than that of SARS-COV and has a high propensity to undergo phase separation. Higher flexibility of nCOVID-19 receptor binding domain might enable it to bind multiple receptor partners. Further experimental work on the association of these receptors with spike protein may help us to explain the severity of nCOVID-19 infection in patients with comorbidities.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlfaxalone is a fast acting intravenous anesthetic with high therapeutic index. It is an analogue of the naturally-occurring neurosteroid, allopregnanolone which has been implicated in causing neuroprotection, neurogenesis and preservation of cognition, through activation of pregnane X receptors in the central nervous system. This study investigated whether alfaxalone can activate human pregnane X receptors (h-PXR) as effectively as allopregnanolone.\n\nMethodsAllopregnanolone and alfaxalone were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to make allopregnanolone and alfaxalone treatment solutions (serial 3-fold dilution concentration range, 50,000 - 206 nM). Activation of h-PXR by these ligand solutions compared with vehicle control was measured by an in-vitro method using human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) expressing h-PXR hybridised and linked to the firefly luciferase gene. Ligand binding with and activation of h-PXR in those cells caused downstream changes in luciferase activity and light emission. That activity was measured as relative light units using a plate-reading luminometer, thus quantifying the changes in h-PXR activity caused by the ligand applied to the HEK293 cells. Ligand log concentration response curves were constructed to compare efficacy and potency of allopregnanolone and alfaxalone.\n\nResultsAllopregnanolone and alfaxalone both activated the h-PXR to cause dose-related light emission by the linked firefly luciferase. Control solutions (0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide) produced low level light emissions. Equimolar concentrations of alfaxalone were more efficacious in activation of h-PXR: 50,000 nM, p = 0.0019; 16,700 nM, p = 0.0472; 5,600 nM, p = 0.0031 [Brown-Forsythe and Welch ANOVA].\n\nConclusionsAlfaxalone activates human-pregnane X receptors with greater efficacy compared with the endogenous ligand allopregnanolone. These results suggest that alfaxalone sedation and anesthesia may be accompanied by beneficial effects normally caused by the physiological effects of allopregnanolone, namely neuroprotection, neurogenesis, and preservation of cognition.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA coronavirus responsible for the ongoing 2019-2020 COVID-19 outbreak. The highly contagious COVID-19 disease has spread to 216 countries in less than six months. Though several vaccine candidates are being claimed, an effective vaccine is yet to come. In present study we have designed and theoretically validated novel Multi-Patch Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.\n\nMethodologyA novel reverse epitomics approach, \"overlapping-epitope-clusters-to-patches\" method is utilized to identify multiple antigenic regions from the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. These antigenic regions are here termed as \"Ag-Patch or Ag-Patches\", for Antigenic Patch or Patches. The identification of Ag-Patches is based on clusters of overlapping epitopes rising from a particular region of SARS-CoV-2 protein. Further, we have utilized the identified Ag-Patches to design Multi-Patch Vaccines (MPVs), proposing a novel methodology for vaccine design and development. The designed MPVs were analyzed for immunologically crucial parameters, physiochemical properties and cDNA constructs.\n\nResultsWe identified 73 CTL (Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte), 49 HTL (Helper T-Lymphocyte) novel Ag-Patches from the proteome of SARS-CoV-2. The identified Ag-Patches utilized to design MPVs cover 768 (518 CTL and 250 HTL) overlapping epitopes targeting different HLA alleles. Such large number of epitope coverage is not possible for multi-epitope vaccines. The large number of epitopes covered implies large number of HLA alleles targeted, and hence large ethnically distributed human population coverage. The MPVs:Toll-Like Receptor ectodomain complex shows stable nature with numerous hydrogen bond formation and acceptable root mean square deviation and fluctuation. Further, the cDNA analysis favors high expression of the MPVs constructs in human cell line.\n\nConclusionHighly immunogenic novel Ag-Patches are identified from the entire proteome of SARS CoV-2 by a novel reverse epitomics approach. We conclude that the novel Multi-Patch Vaccines could be a highly potential novel approach to combat SARS-CoV-2, with greater effectiveness, high specificity and large human population coverage worldwide.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=187 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/284992v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (84K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@176f27org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@82a4fcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11db43forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12495b2_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOABSTRACT FIGURE:C_FLOATNO A Multi-Patch Vaccine design to combat SARS-CoV-2 and a method to prepare thereof.\n\nMulti-Patch Vaccine designing to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection by reverse epitomics approach, \"Overlapping-epitope-clusters-to-patches\" method.\n\nC_FIG",

One of the clinically most useful advantages of WGS is the ability to predict antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in bacterial sequences. This allows comprehensive investigations of such genetic features but can also be used for epidemiological studies. A plethora of software programs have been developed for the detailed annotation of bacterial DNA sequences, such as RAST (Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology), Resfinder, ISfinder, INTEGRALL and The Transposon Registry. Unfortunately, to this day, a reliable annotation tool of the combination of ARGs and MGEs is not available, and the generation of genbank files requires much manual input. Here, we present a new webserver which allows the annotation of ARGs, integrons, and transposable elements at the same time. The pipeline generates genbank files automatically, which are compatible with easyfig for comparative genomic analysis.

Here we applied kinome-wide gene deletion and gene tagging in Leishmania mexicana promastigotes to define protein kinases with life cycle transition roles. Whilst 162 were dispensable, 44 protein kinase genes were refractory to deletion in promastigotes and are likely core genes required for parasite replication. Phenotyping of pooled gene deletion mutants using bar-seq and projection pursuit clustering revealed functional phenotypic groups of protein kinases involved in differentiation from metacyclic promastigote to amastigote, growth and survival in macrophages and mice, colonisation of the sand fly and motility. This unbiased interrogation of protein kinase function in Leishmania allows targeted investigation of organelle-associated signalling pathways required for successful intracellular parasitism.",

    "abstract": "Bark microbial communities are poorly understood, and information on the metabolic capacities of their inhabitants is lacking. Bark microbial communities share part of their taxonomic composition with soil, but the functional differences and similarities are unknown. By comparing bark microbial communities of avocado trees (Persea americana, Mill.) with rhizospheric soil, functional processes relevant to the bark environment were identified. DNA from bark and soil communities was extracted from the same trees, and shotgun metagenomics sequencing was performed using nextSeq technology. Genes were identified by BLAST methods, and functional annotation was performed with KEGG databases as a reference. Bacterial oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis genes were highly abundant in bark as compared to soil. Furthermore, increased presence of nitrogenase genes suggests a potential for nitrogen fixation. Genes for methanol utilization were abundant in bark, but no evidence of methane utilization potential was observed. Bark microbial communities have the genetic information for potential primary productivity, which might contribute to microbial growth independent of plant-derived carbon substrates.",

    "abstract": "The components and subprocesses underlying the formation of COPI-coated vesicles at the Golgi are well understood. The coating cascade is initiated after the small GTPase Arf1 is activated by the Sec7 domain-containing guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1. This causes a conformational shift within Arf1 that facilitates stable association of Arf1 with the membrane, a process required for subsequent recruitment of the COPI coat. Although we have an atomic level knowledge of Arf1 activation by Sec7 domain-containing GEFs, our understanding of the biophysical parameters that regulate Arf1 and GBF1 association with Golgi membranes and with each other is limited. We used Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) data and kinetic Monte Carlo simulation based on continuous-time random walk to assess behavior of Arf1 and GBF1 during COPI vesicle formation in live cells. Our analyses support a model in which Arf1 and GBF1 associate with Golgi membranes independently, with an excess of GBF1 relative to Arf1, and in which Arf1 activation is much faster than GBF1 cycling on the membrane. Interestingly, modeling the behavior of the GBF1/E794K mutant stabilized on the membrane is inconsistent with the formation of a stable complex between it and an endogenous Arf1, and suggests that its prolonged association with the membrane occurs independently of complex formation.",

The chronological and spatial distance among the cases indicate an absence of fitness to the classical malaria cycle. This peculiar condition raised the suspicion of a reservoir, possibly the non-human primates. Simian and human malaria occur at the same places in that region, and there is already evidence of molecular identity between the simian parasites, Plasmodium simium and Plasmodium brasilianum, and the human parasites, Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium malariae, respectively. Two different SNPs identified in the COX1 region of the Plasmodium vivax/simium of the Atlantic Forest reinforced its characterization as a zoonotic parasite. This finding supported the development of a PCR-RFLP protocol to identify such polymorphisms, and to monitor zoonotic malaria transmission.\n\nMethodsIn the present work, we tested the above-mentioned PCR-RFLP protocol in unprecedented mosquitoes and simian samples collected in Espirito Santo State, Brazil (ES).\n\nResultsThe parasite found in the simian sample was P. vivax, contrary to what the protocol should indicate. In the mosquito samples, the protocol disclosed both forms of the parasite.\n\nConclusionThis result suggests that the previously published pair of SNPs, and, consequently, the PCR-RFLP protocol, are not able to distinguish the dynamics of Plasmodium spp. circulation in the Atlantic Forest endemic area of ES.",

Many studies have high-lighted the potentially complex ways in which phylogenetic information is translated into species ecological properties. However, much less emphasis has been placed on developing expectations for community properties under a particular hypothesis.\n\nIn this work, we couple a simple model of trait evolution on a phylogenetic tree with local community dynamics governed by Lotka-Volterra equations. This allows us to derive properties of the community of coexisting species as a function of the number of traits, tree topology and the size of the species pool. Our results highlight how phylogenies and traits, in concert, affect the coexistence of a set of species.\n\nIn this way, our work provides new baseline expectations for the ways in which phylogenetic information is reflected in the structure of and coexistence within local communities.",

    "abstract": "Perspectives in conservation are based on a variety of value systems. Such differences in how people value nature and its components lead to different evaluations of the morality of conservation goals and approaches, and often underlie disagreements in the formulation and implementation of environmental management policies. Specifically, whether a conservation action (e.g. killing feral cats to reduce predation on bird species threatened with extinction) is viewed as appropriate or not can vary among people with different value systems. Here, we present a conceptual, mathematical framework intended as a tool to systematically explore and clarify core value statements in conservation approaches. Its purpose is to highlight how fundamental differences between these value systems can lead to different prioritizations of available management options and offer a common ground for discourse. The proposed equations decompose the question underlying many controversies around management decisions in conservation: what or who is valued, how, and to what extent? We compare how management decisions would likely be viewed under three different idealised value systems: ecocentric conservation, which aims to preserve biodiversity; new conservation, which considers that biodiversity can only be preserved if it benefits humans; and sentientist conservation, which aims at minimising suffering for sentient beings. We illustrate the utility of the framework by applying it to case studies involving invasive alien species, rewilding, and trophy hunting. By making value systems and their consequences in practice explicit, the framework facilitates debates on contested conservation issues, and complements philosophical discursive approaches about moral reasoning. We believe dissecting the core value statements on which conservation decisions are based will provide an additional tool to understand and address conservation conflicts.",

    "abstract": "An evolutionary process is reflected in the sequence of changes of any trait (e.g. morphological, molecular) through time. Yet, a better understanding of evolution would be procured by characterizing correlated evolution, or when two or more evolutionary processes interact. Many previously developed parametric methods often require significant computing time as they rely on the estimation of many parameters. Here we propose a minimal likelihood framework modelling the joint evolution of two traits on a known phylogenetic tree. The type and strength of correlated evolution is characterized by few parameters tuning mutation rates of each trait and interdependencies between these rates. The framework can be applied to study any discrete trait or character ranging from nucleotide substitution to gain or loss of a biological function. More specifically, it can be used to 1) test for independence between two evolutionary processes, 2) identify the type of interaction between them and 3) estimate parameter values of the most likely model of interaction. In its current implementation, the method takes as input a phylogenetic tree together with mapped discrete evolutionary events on it and then maximizes the likelihood for one or several chosen scenarios. The strengths and limits of the method, as well as its relative power when compared to a few other methods, are assessed using both simulations and data from 16S rRNA sequences in a sample of 54 {gamma}-enterobacteria. We show that even with datasets of fewer than 100 species, the method performs well in parameter estimation and in the selection of evolutionary scenario.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe release of genetically modified mosquitoes which use gene-drive mechanisms to suppress reproduction in natural populations of Anopheles mosquitoes is one of the scientifically most promising methods for malaria transmission control. However, many scientific, regulatory and ethical questions remain before transgenic mosquitoes can be utilised in the field. Mutations which reduce an individuals reproductive success are likely to create strong selective pressures to evolve resistance. It is thus crucial that the targeted population collapses as rapidly and as completely as possible to reduce the available time for the emergence of drive-resistant mutations. At a behavioural level, this means that the gene-drive carrying mutants should be at least as (and ideally more) sexually attractive than the wildtype population they compete against. A key element in the copulatory negotiations of Anopheles mosquitoes is their acoustic courtship. We therefore analysed sound emissions and acoustic preference in a doublesex mutant previously used to successfully collapse caged colonies of Anopheles gambiae s.l..\n\nMethodsThe flight tones produced by the beating of their wings form the signals for acoustic mating communication in Anopheles species. We assessed the acoustic impact of the disruption of a female-specific isoform of the doublesex gene (dsxF) on the wing beat frequency (WBF; measured as flight tone) of both males (XY) and females (XX) in homozygous dsxF- mutants (dsxF-/-), heterozygous dsxF- carriers (dsxF+/-) and G3  wildtype dsxF+ controls (dsxF+/+). To exclude non-genetic influences, we controlled for temperature and measured wing lengths for all experimental animals. We used a phonotaxis assay to test the acoustic preferences of mutant and control mosquitoes.\n\nResultsA previous study demonstrated an altered phenotype only for females homozygous for the disrupted dsx allele (dsxF-/-), who appear intersex. No phenotypic changes were observed for heterozygous carriers or males, suggesting that the female-specific dsxF allele is haplosufficient. We here identify significant, dose-dependent increases in the flight tones of both dsxF-/- and dsxF+/- females when compared to dsxF+/+ control females. Flight tone frequencies in all three female genotypes remained significantly lower than in males, however. When tested experimentally, males showed stronger phonotactic responses to the flight tones of control dsxF+/+ females. While flight tones from dsxF+/- and dsxF-/- females also elicited positive phonotactic behaviour in males, this was significantly reduced compared to responses to control tones. We found no evidence of phonotactic behaviour in any female genotype tested. None of the male genotypes displayed any deviations from the control condition.\n\nConclusionsA key prerequisite for copulation in anopheline mosquitoes is the phonotactic attraction of males towards female flight tones within large - spatially and acoustically crowded - mating swarms. Reductions in acoustic attractiveness of released mutant lines, as reported here for heterozygous dsxF+/- females, reduce the lines mating efficiency, and could consequently reduce the efficacy of the associated population control effort. Assessments of caged populations may not successfully reproduce the challenges posed by natural mating scenarios. We propose to amend existing testing protocols in order to more faithfully reflect the competitive conditions between a mutant line and the wildtype population it is meant to interact with. This should also include novel tests of  acoustic fitness. In line with previous studies, our findings confirm that disruption of the female-specific isoform dsxF has no effect on males; for some phenotypic traits, such as female flight tones, however, the effects of dsxF appear to be dose-dependent rather than haplosufficient.",

    "abstract": "Knowing protein function is crucial to advance molecular and medical biology, yet experimental function annotations through the Gene Ontology (GO) exist for fewer than 0.5% of all known proteins. Computational methods bridge this sequence-annotation gap typically through homology-based annotation transfer by identifying sequence-similar proteins with known function or through prediction methods using evolutionary information. Here, we propose predicting GO terms through annotation transfer based on proximity of proteins in the SeqVec embedding rather than in sequence space. These embeddings originate from deep learned language models (LMs) for protein sequences (SeqVec) transferring the knowledge gained from predicting the next amino acid in 33 million protein sequences. Replicating the conditions of CAFA3, our method reaches an Fmax of 37{+/-}2%, 50{+/-}3%, and 57{+/-}2% for BPO, MFO, and CCO, respectively. Numerically, this appears close to the top ten CAFA3 methods. When restricting the annotation transfer to proteins with <20% pairwise sequence identity to the query, performance drops (Fmax BPO 33{+/-}2%, MFO 43{+/-}3%, CCO 53{+/-}2%); this still outperforms naive sequence-based transfer. Preliminary results from CAFA4 appear to confirm these findings. Overall, this new concept is likely to change the annotation of proteins, in particular for proteins from smaller families or proteins with intrinsically disordered regions.",

Some of these mutations decrease the stability of ORF10, e.g. I4L and V6I were found in the MoRF region of ORF10 which may also possibly contribute to Intrinsic protein disorder. Furthermore, a physicochemical and structural comparative analysis was carried out on SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin-CoV ORF10 proteins, which share 97.37% amino acid homology. The high degree of physicochemical and structural similarity of ORF10 proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin-CoV open questions about the architecture of SARS-CoV-2 due to the disagreement of these two ORF10 proteins over their sub-structure (loop/coil region), solubility, antigenicity and change from the strand to coil at amino acid position 26, where tyrosine is present. Altogether, SARS-CoV-2 ORF10 is a promising pharmaceutical target and a protein which should be monitored for changes which correlate to change pathogenesis and clinical course of COVID-19 infection.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults, with a median survival of just over one year. The failure of available treatments to achieve remission in patients with GBM has been attributed to the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are thought to play a central role in tumor development and progression and serve as a treatment-resistant cell repository capable of driving tumor recurrence; in fact, the property of \"stemness\" itself may be responsible for treatment resistance. In this study, we identify a novel lncRNA, Cancer stem cell associated distal enhancer of SOX2 (CASCADES) that functions as an epigenetic regulator in glioma CSCs (GSCs). CASCADES is expressed in IDH-wild type GBM and significantly enriched in GSCs. Knockdown of CASCADES in GSCs results in differentiation towards a neuronal lineage in a cell- and cancer-specific manner. Bioinformatics analysis reveals that CASCADES functions as a super-enhancer associated lncRNA epigenetic regulator of SOX2. Our findings identify CASCADES as a critical regulator of stemness in GSCs and represent a novel epigenetic and therapeutic target for disrupting the cancer stem cell compartment in GBM.",

    "abstract": "Health organizations have always sought partnership to join competencies in innovation, even with fierce competition in this sector. In this pandemic moment it is relevant to observe how organizations behave to seek quick and safe answers. The present research analyzes how the cooperation networks were set off considering the clinical trials on therapies and vaccines that were developed specifically to treat or prevent COVID-19. Social Network Analysis technique was used to build cooperation networks and apply metrics that characterize these connections. There was an evaluation of statistics of Strength of cooperation and Unilateral dependence of cooperation that identify the cooperation strength between two organizations, and the dependence of this relations. A total of 415 clinical trial were identified, of which 42% are in cooperation. From organizations that have partnership, firms are the first, followed by universities. We extracted the main categories that concentrate 74% of partnerships in the trials of antibody, and vaccine. Several organizations cooperate in multiple categories of trials, evidencing the efforts to focus on different strategies to treat the disease. We found high strength of cooperation and an assimetryc dependency between partners, which can be assigned to specialized models of partnership and it occurs in competitive enviroments like this pandemic moment. Cooperation were not limited to geographical proximity and the advent of Chinese players can represent a new change in the biotechnological development axis. Finally, the challenge of finding therapeutic or immunological solutions for COVID-19 demonstrates a clear composition of cooperation groups that complement their skills to manage organizational strategies to beat the pandemic. In this new paradigm, there can be partnerships not only in clinical trial but also in pre-competitive technologies development. This experience is expected to change the way of organizations define their R&D strategies and start to adopt more a collaborative innovation model.",

    "abstract": "Aging is associated with increased white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) and with the alterations of alpha oscillations (7-13 Hz). However, a crucial question remains, whether changes in alpha oscillations relate to aging per se or whether this relationship is mediated by age-related neuropathology like WMHs. Using a large cohort of cognitively healthy older adults (N=907, 60-80 years), we assessed relative alpha power, alpha peak frequency, and long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) from resting-state EEG. We further associated these parameters with voxel-wise WMHs from 3T MRI. We found that a higher prevalence of WMHs in the superior and posterior corona radiata as well as in the thalamic radiation was related to elevated alpha power, with the strongest association in the bilateral occipital cortex. In contrast, we observed no significant relation of the WMHs probability with alpha peak frequency and LRTC. Finally, higher age was associated with elevated alpha power via total WMH volume. Although an increase in alpha oscillations due to WMH can have a compensatory nature, we rather suggest that an elevated alpha power is a consequence of WMH affecting a spatial organization of alpha sources.",

    "abstract": "Swine pasteurellosis, caused by Pasteurella multocida capsular types A and D, causes heavy economic loss to the pig farmers. The vaccine presently used is abacterin of Pasteurella multocida capsular type B that is proven to be effective against bovine pasteurellosis. However, its efficacy against swine pasteurellosis is questionable. The present study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of calcium phosphate nanoparticle adjuvanted bivalent subunit vaccine prepared from Pasteurella multocida capsular types A and D along with a monovalent subunit vaccine prepared from Pasteurella multocida capsular type B in mice. The Alum precipitated bacterin vaccine was used as the control. The bivalent subunit vaccine comprising the immune components of both the capsular types showed significantly higher IgG response than either of the other two vaccines. Both the calcium phosphate nanoparticle adjuvanted vaccines could elicit 100% protection in mice against homologous challenges but the aluminum hydroxide adjuvanted bacterin vaccine could not elicit significant protection. Based on this preliminary work, it was concluded that the bivalent subunit vaccine would be a better option for immunization of swine against swine pasteurellosis.\n\nIMPORTANCE OF THE WORKThe swine pasteurellosis is an important economic disease affecting the pig population in the North-eastern part of India that contributes the major pig population. The disease is caused by Serotype A and D of Pasteurella multocida. At present the inactivated vaccine is used that is actually developed against P52 strain of serotype B:2 of Pasteurella multocida, which is mainly involved in haemorrhagic septicaemia (or bovine pasteurellosis) that affects the cattle, buffaloe, sheep and goat. As a result, the present vaccine does not give sufficient protection in pigs but gives significant protection in cattle, buffaloe, sheep and goat. Hence, there is a need of development of vaccine that can address specifically swine pasteurellosis by targeting serotype A and D of Pasteurella multocida.",

Previous generation of antifolate drugs are able to inhibit replicative stages of drug-sensitive, but not resistant parasites in humans, and mosquitoes. The lack of reliable gametocyte-producing, antifolate resistant P. falciparum hindrance the development of new antifolate compounds against mosquito stages. We used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to develop transgenic gametocyte producing P. falciparum with quadruple mutations in dhfr gene, using NF54 as a parental strain. The transgenic parasites gained pyrimethamine resistance while maintaining the gametocyte producing activity. In contrast to pyrimethamine that cannot inhibit exflagellation of the quadruple dhfr mutant parasite, the novel antifolate P218 showed a good potency for exflagellation inhibition (exflagellation IC50 10.74 {+/-} 4.22 nM). The exflagellation IC50 was 5.3 times lower than erythrocytic IC50 suggesting that the human to mosquito transmission poses as a strong barrier to prevent P218 resistant parasite among population.

    "abstract": "In mammals, the circadian clock coordinates various cell physiological processes, including the inflammatory response. Recent studies suggested a crosstalk between these two pathways. However, the mechanism of how inflammation affects the circadian clock is not well understood. Here, we investigated the role of the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-{kappa}B in regulating clock function. Using a combination of genetic and pharmacological approaches, we show that perturbation of the canonical NF-{kappa}B subunit RELA in the U2OS cellular model altered core clock gene expression. While RELA activation shortened period length and dampened amplitude in these cells, its inhibition lengthened period length and caused amplitude phenotypes. NF-{kappa}B perturbation also altered circadian rhythms in the master suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) clock and locomotor activity. We show that RELA, like the clock repressor CRY1, potently repressed the transcriptional activity of BMAL1/CLOCK at the circadian E-box cis-element. Biochemical and biophysical analysis showed that RELA competes with coactivator CBP/p300 for binding to the transactivation domain of BMAL1. This mechanism is further supported by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showing that the binding sites of RELA, BMAL1 and CLOCK converge on the E-boxes of clock genes. Taken together, these data support a significant role for NF-{kappa}B in directly regulating circadian clock function and highlight mutual regulation between the circadian and inflammatory pathways.",

    "abstract": "Myosin heavy chain 7b (MYH7b) is an ancient member of the myosin heavy chain motor protein family that is expressed in striated muscles. In mammalian cardiac muscle, MYH7b RNA is expressed along with two other myosin heavy chains, {beta}-myosin heavy chain ({beta}-MyHC) and -myosin heavy chain (a-MyHC). However, unlike {beta}-MyHC and -MyHC which are maintained in a careful balance at the protein level, the MYH7b locus does not produce protein in the heart due to a post-transcriptional exon-skipping mechanism that occurs in a tissue specific manner. Whether this locus has a role in the heart beyond producing its intronic microRNA, miR-499, was unclear. Using cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells as a model system, we have found that the non-coding exon skipped RNA (lncMYH7b) affects the transcriptional landscape of the human heart, independent of miR-499. Specifically, lncMYH7b regulates the ratio of {beta}-MyHC to -MyHC, which is crucial for heart function. This regulation is likely achieved through control of members of the TEA domain transcription factor family (TEAD1 and TEAD3). Therefore, we conclude that this ancient gene has been repurposed by alternative splicing to produce a regulatory long-noncoding RNA in the human heart that affects the myosin composition of the heart.",

    "abstract": "Insect pests consume tastants as their necessary energy and nutrient sources. Gustatory receptors play important roles in insect life and can form within an extremely complicated regulatory network. However, there are still many gustatory genes that have a significant impact on insect physiology, but their functional mechanism is still unknown. Here, we purified and characterized a gustatory receptor (protein) coding gene, NlGr7, from the brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens, which is an important insect pest of rice. Our results revealed that NlGr7 has an active association with various ligands, such as lectins, lipids (phospho- and sphingolipid) and copper. The mass-spectrometry result showed that NlGr7 is a sugar receptor, and NlGr7 is validated by different types of insoluble polysaccharides and a varied range of tastants. Furthermore, we observed that NlGr7-bound ATP hydrolysed on the ATPase activity assay, which indicated that NlGr7 may be associated with important biological functions in the BPH. The important NlGr7 for chemoreception has now been characterized in the BPH. We showed that NlGr7 in the BPH is required for various protein-ligands, as well as protein-sugars interactions, to play crucial roles in this pest. This study will provide valuable information for further functional studies of chemoreception mechanisms in this important agricultural pest.",

Proteomic analysis of cells expressing the mutations revealed, surprisingly, that these two mutants promote distinct oncogenic pathways with Rheb-T23M driving metabolic reprogramming and an increased rate of glycolysis, while Rheb-E40K regulates the translation factor eEF2 and autophagy, likely through a differential interaction with AMPK.\n\nOur findings suggest that unique  bespoke combination therapies may be utilised to treat cancers according to which Rheb mutant they harbour.",

Using live-tracking of PGCs and primary co-cultures of genital ridges (GR), we demonstrated that Wdr11-deficient embryos contained reduced numbers of PGCs which had delayed migration due to significantly decreased proliferation and motility. We found primary cilia-dependent canonical Hedgehog (Hh) signalling was required for proliferation of the somatic mesenchymal cells of GR, while primary cilia-independent non-canonical Hh signalling mediated by Ptch2/Gas1 and downstream effectors Src and Creb was required for PGC proliferation and migration, which was disrupted by the loss of function mutations of WDR11. Therefore, canonical and non-canonical Hh signalling are differentially involved in the development of somatic and germ cell components of the gonads, and WDR11 is required for both of these pathways operating in parallel in GR and PGCs, respectively, during normal PGC development. Our study provides a mechanistic link between the development of GnRH neurones and germ cells mediated by WDR11, which may underlie some cases of KS/CHH and ciliopathies.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing transcription start sites is essential for understanding the regulatory mechanisms that control gene expression. Recently, a new bovine genome assembly (ARS-UCD1.2) with high continuity, accuracy, and completeness was released; however, the functional annotation of the bovine genome lacks precise transcription start sites and contains a low number of transcripts in comparison to human and mouse. Using the RAMPAGE approach, this study identified transcription start sites at high resolution in a large collection of bovine tissues. We found several known and novel transcription start sites attributed to promoters of protein coding and lncRNA genes that were validated through experimental and in silico evidence. With these findings, the annotation of transcription start sites in cattle reached a level comparable to the mouse and human genome annotations. In addition, we identified and characterized transcription start sites for antisense transcripts derived from bidirectional promoters, potential lncRNAs, mRNAs, and pre-miRNAs. We also analyzed the quantitative aspects of RAMPAGE to produce a promoter activity atlas, reaching highly reproducible results comparable to traditional RNA-seq. Co-expression networks revealed considerable use of tissue specific promoters, especially between brain and testicle, which expressed several genes in common from alternate loci. Furthermore, regions surrounding co-expressed modules were enriched in binding factor motifs representative of each tissue. The comprehensive annotation of promoters in such a large collection of tissues will substantially contribute to our understanding of gene expression in cattle and other mammalian species, shortening the gap between genotypes and phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Second instar larvae of the monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus, from a nonmigratory population in Irapuato, Mexico, were reared for twenty-four hours on three species of milkweed hosts: Asclepias curassavica, A. linaria, and Gomphocarpus physocarpus. We then measured larval growth and differential expression of coding genes and of microRNAs. Larval growth was similar on the two Asclepias species, while little growth was observed on G. physocarpus. The greatest differences in coding gene expression occurred in genes controlling growth and detoxification and were most extreme in comparisons between G. physocarpus and the two Asclepias. MicroRNAs are predicted to be involved as regulators of many of these processes, in particular miR-278, differentially expressed here, could be an important regulator of growth through Hippo signaling. The implications for survival of the monarch, especially in the context of environmental factors altering the availability of their favored milkweed species, are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Flying over the open sea is energetically costly for terrestrial birds. Despite this, over-water journeys of many birds, sometimes hundreds of kilometers long, are uncovered by bio-logging technology. To understand how these birds afford their flights over the open sea, we investigated the role of atmospheric conditions, specifically wind and uplift, in subsidizing over-water flight at the global scale. We first established that {Delta}T, the temperature difference between sea surface and air, is a meaningful proxy for uplift over water. Using this proxy, we showed that the spatio-temporal patterns of sea-crossing in terrestrial migratory birds is associated with favorable uplift conditions. We then analyzed route selection over the open sea for five facultative soaring species, representing all major migratory flyways. The birds maximized wind support when selecting their sea-crossing routes and selected higher uplift when suitable wind support was available. They also preferred routes with low long-term uncertainty in wind conditions. Our findings suggest that, in addition to wind, uplift may play a key role in the energy seascape for bird migration that in turn determines strategies and associated costs for birds crossing ecological barriers such as the open sea.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are regulatory small non-coding RNAs that function as translational repressors. MiRNAs are involved in most cellular processes, and their expression and function are presided by several factors. Amongst, miRNA editing is an epitranscriptional modification that alters the original nucleotide sequence of selected miRNAs, possibly influencing their biogenesis and target-binding ability. A-to-I and C-to-U RNA editing are recognized as the canonical types, with the A-to-I type being the predominant one. Albeit some bioinformatics resources have been implemented to collect RNA editing data, it still lacks a comprehensive resource explicitly dedicated to miRNA editing. Here, we present MiREDiBase, a manually curated catalog of editing events in miRNAs. The current version includes 3,059 unique validated and putative editing sites from 626 pre-miRNAs in humans and three primates. Editing events in mature human miRNAs are supplied with miRNA-target predictions and enrichment analysis, while minimum free energy structures are inferred for edited pre-miRNAs. MiREDiBase represents a valuable tool for cell biology and biomedical research and will be continuously updated and expanded at https://ncrnaome.osumc.edu/miredibase.",

    "abstract": "MotivationGenome data is a subject of study for both biology and computer science since the start of Human Genome Project in 1990. Since then, genome sequencing for medical and social purposes becomes more and more available and affordable. Genome data can be shared on public websites or with service providers. However, this sharing compromises the privacy of donors even under partial sharing conditions. We mainly focus on the liability aspect ensued by unauthorized sharing of these genome data. One of the techniques to address the liability issues in data sharing is watermarking mechanism.\n\nResultsTo detect malicious correspondents and service providers (SPs) -whose aim is to share genome data without individuals consent and undetected-, we propose a novel watermarking method on sequential genome data using belief propagation algorithm. In our method, we have two criteria to satisfy. (i) Embedding robust watermarks so that the malicious adversaries can not temper the watermark by modification and are identified with high probability (ii) Achieving{epsilon} -local differential privacy in all data sharings with SPs. For the preservation of system robustness against single SP and collusion attacks, we consider publicly available genomic information like Minor Allele Frequency, Linkage Disequilibrium, Phenotype Information and Familial Information. Our proposed scheme achieves 100% detection rate against the single SP attacks with only 3% watermark length. For the worst case scenario of collusion attacks (50% of SPs are malicious), 80% detection is achieved with 5% watermark length and 90% detection is achieved with 10% watermark length. For all cases,{epsilon} s impact on precision remained negligible and high privacy is ensured.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/acoksuz/PPRW_SGD_BPLDP\n\nContactabdullahcaglaroksuz@gmail.com",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have revealed that type II collagen positive (Col2+) cells represent a kind of skeleton stem cells (SSC) and their descendants contribute to chondrocytes, osteoblasts, Cxcl12 (chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12)-abundant stromal cells and bone marrow stromal/mesenchymal progenitor cells in postnatal life. To further elucidate the function of Col2+ progenitors, we generated mice with ablation of either embryonic or postnatal Col2+ cells. Embryonic ablation of Col2+ progenitors caused the mouse die at newborn with the absence of all skeleton except partial craniofacial bone, as well as multiple organ development defects and blood vessel loss. Postnatal ablation of Col2+ cells causes mouse growth retardation and collagenopathy phenotype. By examining Col2+ cells ablated mice, we found that, besides contributing to long bone and vertebral bone development, Col2+ cells are also involved in calvaria bone development. Meanwhile, Col2+ cells are the major cells to contribute all skeletal development including spine, rib and long bones. Moreover, our functional study provide evidence that intramembranous ossification is involved in craniofacial bone formation and long bone development, but not participates in spine development.\n\nBy performing lineage tracing experiments in embryonic or postnatal mice, we discovered that the presence of Col2+ progenitors not only within the bone marrow and growth plate (GP) but also within articular cartilage. Moreover, the number and differentiation ability of Col2+ progenitors were decreased with age in long bone and knee. Furthermore, fate-mapping studies revealed that Col2+ progenitors also contributed to CD31+ blood vessel endothelial development in calvariae bone, long bone and many organs. Interestingly, we found only 25.4% CD31+ blood vessel endothelial in long bone but almost all the CD31+ blood vessel endothelial in calvariae bone are differentiated from Col2+ cells. Consistently, postnatal Col2+ cells differentiated to both chondrocytes and CD31+ blood vessel endothelial cells during bone fracture healing. Therefore, this study reveals that Col2+ progenitors are the major source of endochondral ossification, and they also contribute to vascular development in multiple organs and fracture repair.",

    "abstract": "Knowing where we are, where we have been, and where we are going is critical to many behaviors, including navigation and memory. One potential neuronal mechanism underlying this ability is phase precession, in which spatially tuned neurons represent sequences of positions by activating at progressively earlier phases of local network theta (~5-10 Hz) oscillations. Phase precession may be a general neural pattern for representing sequential events for learning and memory. However, phase precession has never been observed in humans. By recording human single-neuron activity during spatial navigation, we show that spatially tuned neurons in the human hippocampus and entorhinal cortex exhibit phase precession. Furthermore, beyond the neural representation of locations, we show evidence for phase precession related to specific goal-states. Our findings thus extend theta phase precession to humans and suggest that this phenomenon has a broad functional role for the neural representation of both spatial and non-spatial information.",
