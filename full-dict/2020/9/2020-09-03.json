    "abstract": "We showed the results of the first long-term analysis (1987-2019) of pesticide impact in the main agricultural area of Argentina. Using a clear and meaningful tool, based not only on acute toxicity but also on scaling up the results to total sown area, we identified time trends for both total pesticide impact and the ecoefficiency of modal pesticide profiles. By the end of the time series, soybean showed a pesticide impact four times greater than maize crop in the studied area. However, the time trend in the last years showed a sustainable pattern of pesticide use, with an improvement in the ecoefficiency. Oppositely, maize showed a relatively constant ecoefficiency value during most of the time series, suggesting a possible path towards an unsustainable cropping system. Findings from this study suggest that some efforts have to be made to improve the pest management decisions towards a more efficient pesticide profiles in maize crop and to keep improving the ecotoxicity pesticide profile in soybean crops because of its large sown area in the studied area.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how and why complex communities can be stable has preoccupied ecologists for over a century. Data show that real communities tend to exhibit characteristic motifs and topologies. Despite a large body of theory investigating both ecological (niche partitioning) and evolutionary (speciation and extinction) mechanisms, a general explanation for why particular motifs are more common than others remains elusive. Here we develop a mechanistic framework that investigates the set of possible motifs that can emerge under minimal conditions of a nutrient-limited system with no external inputs, and no spatial heterogeneity. Focusing on consumer-resource communities structured by competition and predation, we find that the emergent motifs under these minimal conditions are vertical trophic chains that maximize energy transfer and biomass production. Not only are such motifs stable to perturbations of species abundances, but they are also robust to species additions and removals. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for why tri-trophic chains are overrepresented in real food webs. They suggest that, because they maximize energy transfer, and can emerge and persist under minimal conditions, vertical trophic chains may constitute the fundamental architecture of consumer-resource communities.",

    "abstract": "The novel Coronavirus from Wuhan China discovered in December 2019 (nCOV-2019) has since developed into a global epidemic with major concerns about the possibility of the virus evolving into something even more sinister. In the present study we constructed the phylo-geo-network of nCOV-2019 genomes from across India to understand the viral evolution in the country. A total of 611 full length genomes were extracted from different states of India from the EpiCov repository of GISAID initiative and NCBI. Their alignment uncovered 270 parsimony informative sites. Further, 339 genomes were divided into 51 haplogroups. The network revealed the core haplogroup as that of reference sequence NC_045512.2 (Haplogroup A1) with 157 identical sequences present across 16 states. The rest were having not more than ten identical sequences across not more than three locations. Interestingly, some locations with fewer samples have more haplogroups and most haplogroups (41) are localized exclusively to any one state only, suggesting the local evolution of viruses. The two most common lineages are B6 and B1 (Pangolin) whereas clade A2a (Covidex) appears to be the most predominant in India. However, since the pandemic is still emerging, the final outcome will be clear later only.",

    "abstract": "Cryptococcus neoformans is responsible for life-threatening infections that primarily affect immunocompromised individuals and has an estimated worldwide burden of 220,000 new cases each year--with 180,000 resulting deaths--mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. Surprisingly, little is known about the ecological niches occupied by C. neoformans in nature. To expand our understanding of the distribution and ecological associations of this pathogen we implement a Natural Language Processing approach to better describe the niche of C. neoformans. We use a Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to de novo topic model sets of metagenetic research articles written about varied subjects which either explicitly mention, inadvertently find, or fail to find C. neoformans. These articles are all linked to NCBI Sequence Read Archive datasets of 18S ribosomal RNA and/or Internal Transcribed Spacer gene-regions. The number of topics was determined based on the model coherence score, and articles were assigned to the created topics via a Machine Learning approach with a Random Forest algorithm. Our analysis provides support for a previously suggested linkage between C. neoformans and soils associated with decomposing wood. Our approach, using a search of single-locus metagenetic data, gathering papers connected to the datasets, de novo determination of topics, the number of topics, and assignment of articles to the topics, illustrates how such an analysis pipeline can harness large-scale datasets that are published/available but not necessarily fully analyzed, or whose metadata is not harmonized with other studies. Our approach can be applied to a variety of systems to assert potential evidence of environmental associations.\n\nAuthor SummaryOur finding that C. neoformans is associated with decomposing wood is reinforced by the general literature on C. neoformans and its close congeneric relatives and warrants further investigation. This work demonstrates the potential utility of pairing Natural Language Processing (NLP) with single-locus metagenetic data for the study of Neglected Tropical Diseases. We present a novel method to study the ecological niches of rare pathogens that leverages the immense amount of data available to researchers in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA)combined with a text-mining analysis based on Natural Language Processing. We demonstrate that text processing, noun identification, and verb identification can play an important role in analyzing a large corpus of documents together with metagenetic data. Forging this connection requires access to all of the available ecological 18S ribosomal RNA and Internal Transcribed Spacer NCBI SRA datasets. These datasets use metabarcoding to query taxonomic diversity in eukaryotic organisms, and in the case of the Internal Transcribed Spacer, they specifically target Fungi. The presence of specific species is inferred when diagnostic 18S or ITS gene region sequences are found in the SRA data. We searched for C. neoformans in all 18S and ITS datasets available and gathered all associated journal articles that either cite the SRA data accessions or are cited in the SRA data accessions.\n\nPublished metagenetic data often have associated metadata including: latitude and longitude, temperature, and other physical characteristics describing the conditions in which the metagenetic sample was collected. These metadata are not always be presented in consistent formats, so harmonizing study methods may be needed to appropriately compare metagenetic data as commonly required in metanalysis studies. We present an analysis which takes as input articles associated with SRA datasets that were found to contain evidence of C. neoformans. We apply NLP methods to this corpus of articles to describe the niche of C. neoformans. Our results reinforce the current understanding of C. neoformanss niche, indicating the pertinence of employing a NLP analysis to identify the niche of an organism. This approach could further the description of virtually any other organism that routinely appears in metagenetic surveys, especially pathogens, whose ecological niches are unknown or poorly understood.\n\nOptional Striking Image\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/280578v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (66K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@135ce50org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17bf52borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11cf682org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7be6ea_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Cryptococcus neoformans cells budding.

    "abstract": "BackgroundAccording to the World Health Organization, snakebites, a common occupational hazard in developing countries accounts an annual loss of between 81,000 and 139, 000 lives following 5 million of bites of which 2.7 million results in envenomation. Since snakebite associated morbidity and mortality is more prevalent in agriculture economies such as Ghana, health professionals should be optimally knowledgeable on how to manage incidence of snakebites. Lack of knowledge or overestimation of a professionals knowledge can be affects heath delivery especially for emergency situations such as snakebites. The three (3) Tongu districts South Eastern Ghana which are rurally situated with agriculture as the major source of livelihood for their inhabitants are prone to snakebite incidence hence the need to assess whether the health professionals in these districts are well equipped by way of knowledge to handle such emergencies and whether they are able to rightly estimate their knowledge with regards to snakebite management.\n\nMethodology/Principal findingsData was collected using a de novo semi-structured questionnaire administered through google form whose link was sent via to 186 health workers made up of nurses, midwives, physician assistants, medical doctors, pharmacists, and pharmacy technicians. This data was analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 25. Association between variables was determined using the appropriate tools where necessary, using a confidence interval of 95% and significance assumed when p [&le;] 0.05. This study found male health workers significantly more knowledgeable about snakebite management (11.53{+/-}5.67 vrs 9.64{+/-}5.46; p = 0.022) but it was the females who overestimated their knowledge level (27.9% vrs 24.1%). The medical doctors exhibited the best knowledge on snakebite management with the registered general nurses least knowledgeable. Although most professionals overestimated their knowledge, the registered general nurses were the worst at that (53.7%). Overall knowledge of health care professionals on snakebite management was below average [10.60{+/-}5.62/22 (48.2%)] but previous in-service training and involvement in management of snakebite were associated with better knowledge. Respondents who had no previous training overestimated their knowledge level compared to those who had some post qualification training on snakebite management (7.5% vrs 38.1%). Greatest knowledge deficit of respondents was on the management of ASV associated adverse reactions.\n\nConclusionHealth workers in rural Ghana overestimated their knowledge about snakebite management although their knowledge was low. Training schools therefore need to incorporate snakebite management in their curriculum and health authorities should also expose health workers to more in-service training on this neglected tropical disease.\n\nAuthor summaryWorld Health Organization estimates that every year between 81,000 and 139,000 die due snake bites across the world. Mismanagement of snakebites can result in increased disabilities and death if not handled by knowledgeable health workers. This study assessed if various categories of health workers made up of professionals from the medical, pharmaceutical and nursing categories in the three neighbouring Tongu districts in Ghana have the appropriate level of knowledge on snakebite management. Using a newly developed questionnaire, data was collected from the respondents using google forms sent to their WhatsApp platforms. Data was then analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 25. Results were presented in the form of tables and association between the variables also determined. The level of knowledge of sampled health workers on snakebite was below average especially among the nursing professionals. However, those who had some previous post qualification training on snakebite management exhibited a significant superior knowledge and least overestimated their knowledge hence policy makers should through workshops equip health workers especially the nurses on snakebites so that rural dwellers whose health care needs are mainly attended to by nurses can be better managed when they suffer snakebites.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health, physical activity, and sedentary behavior of citizens worldwide. Using an online survey with 1669 respondents, we sought to understand why and how by querying about perceived barriers and motivators to physical activity that changed because of the pandemic, and how those changes impacted mental health. Consistent with prior reports, our respondents were less physically active (aerobic activity, -11%, p <0.05; strength-based activity, -30%, p<0.01) and more sedentary (+11%, p<0.01) during the pandemic as compared to 6-months before. The pandemic also increased psychological stress (+22%, p <0.01) and brought on moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression. Respondents whose mental health deteriorated the most were also the ones who were least active (depression r = -.21, p<0.01; anxiety r = -.12, p<0.01). The majority of respondents were unmotivated to exercise because they were too anxious (+8%, p <0.01), lacked social support (+6%, p =<0.01), or had limited access to equipment (+23%, p <0.01) or space (+41%, p <0.01). The respondents who were able to stay active reported feeling less motivated by physical health outcomes such as weight loss (-7%, p<0.01) or strength (-14%, p<0.01) and instead more motivated by mental health outcomes such as anxiety relief (+14%, p <0.01). Coupled with previous work demonstrating a direct relationship between mental health and physical activity, these results highlight the potential protective effect of physical activity on mental health and point to the need for psychological support to overcome perceived barriers so that people can continue to be physically active during stressful times like the pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Current approaches to high-field fMRI provide two means to map hemodynamics at the level of single vessels in the brain. One is through changes in deoxyhemoglobin in venules, i.e., blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI, while the second is through changes in arteriole diameter, i.e., cerebral blood volume (CBV) fMRI. Here we introduce cerebral blood flow (CBF)-fMRI, which uses high-resolution phase-contrast MRI to form velocity measurements of flow and demonstrate CBF-fMRI in single penetrating microvessels across rat parietal cortex. In contrast to the venule-dominated BOLD and arteriole-dominated CBV fMRI signal, the phase-contrast -based CBF signal changes are highly comparable from both arterioles and venules. Thus, we have developed a single-vessel fMRI platform to map the BOLD, CBV, and CBF from penetrating microvessels throughout the cortex. This high-resolution single-vessel fMRI mapping scheme not only enables the vessel-specific hemodynamic mapping in diseased animal models but also presents a translational potential to map vascular dementia in diseased or injured human brains with ultra-high field fMRI.\n\nSummaryWe established a high-resolution PC-based single-vessel velocity mapping method using the high field MRI. This PC-based micro-vessel velocity measurement enables the development of the single-vessel CBF-fMRI method. In particular, in contrast to the arteriole-dominated CBV and venule-dominated BOLD responses, the CBF-fMRI shows similar velocity changes in penetrating arterioles and venules in activated brain regions. Thus, we have built a noninvasive single-vessel fMRI mapping scheme for BOLD, CBV, and CBF hemodynamic parameter measurements in animals.",

People vary in the way they make decisions, resulting in different levels of risk-taking behavior. These differences have been linked to prefrontal theta band activity. However, a direct functional relationship between prefrontal theta band activity and risk-taking has not yet been demonstrated.\n\nObjectiveWe used noninvasive brain stimulation to test the functional relevance of prefrontal oscillatory theta activity for the regulatory control of risk-taking behavior.\n\nMethodsIn a within-subject experiment, 32 healthy participants received theta [4-8 Hertz (Hz)], gamma (30-50 Hz), and sham transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) over the left prefrontal cortex (lPFC). During stimulation, participants completed a task assessing their risk-taking behavior as well as response times and sensitivity to value and outcome probabilities. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded before and immediately after stimulation.\n\nResultsTheta-band, but not gamma-band or sham, tACS led to a significant reduction in risk-taking behavior, indicating a frequency-specific effect of prefrontal brain stimulation on the modulation of risk-taking behavior. Moreover, theta-band stimulation led to increased response times and decreased sensitivity to reward values. EEG data analyses did not show an increase in power in the stimulated frequencies.\n\nConclusionThese findings provide direct empirical evidence for the effects of prefrontal theta-band stimulation on behavioral risk-taking regulation.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionPrevious studies have shown that putative pheromones 4,16-androstadien-3-one (AND) and estra-1,3,5(10),16-tetraen-3-ol (EST) cause activation in the preoptic area/anterior hypothalamus in men and women. Sex differences in neural activation patterns have been demonstrated when participants are subject to pheromone stimulation; however, whether other compounds give rise to similar neural activity has not been completely investigated.\n\nMethodsTwenty-nine young adults [16 female (21.3+/-0.54; mean yrs+/-SE), 13 male (22.85+/-0.42)] participated in a 3-block design, where participants were exposed to a scent (lavender), a synthetic male pheromone (4,16-androstadien-3b-ol; ALD), and a synthetic female pheromone (1,3,5(10),16-Estratetraen-3-ol; EST) via an automated olfactometer. Whole-brain, high-resolution (1.8mm3) functional MRI data from a Siemens Trio 3T MRI scanner were collected during all blocks. Five adults were excluded due to excessive movement. MANOVA analysis, a 2 x 3 multivariate model and analysis of 2x2 effects between sex and subsets of stimuli was done for activation over the whole brain and small volumes involved in olfaction.\n\nResultsExploratory analysis of 2x2 effects between sex and subsets of stimuli exhibited significant interactions when assessing activations over the whole brain, and small volumes involved in olfaction. The left and right frontal poles (LFP, RFP) shows significant interaction when assessing sex with lavender and EST for whole brain analysis. For small volume analysis, the right orbitofrontal cortex (ROFC) exhibited a sex with lavender and ALD interaction, and a sex with lavender and EST interaction was observed in the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG). Main effects of sex, stimulus, or interaction show no differences analyzed using a 2 x 3 multivariate model.\n\nConclusionThe study shows there is a sexually dimorphic response in the olfactory system to pheromones not previously studied. Scents like lavender do not have this same response. These distinct functional differences in activation patterns may be a result of neural development and maturation differences between sexes. Future studies should expand this pilot study and involve a younger demographic to accurately determine the age at which the olfactory response differentiates between males and females.",

However, the restriction of inflammatory and immune responses by IL-10 can also favor the development and/or persistence of chronic infections or neoplasms. Dogs that succumb to leishmaniasis caused by L. infantum (CanL) develop exhaustion of T lymphocytes and are unable to mount appropriate cellular immune responses to control the infection. These animals fail to mount specific lymphoproliferative responses and produce interferon gamma and TNF-alpha that would activate macrophages and promote destruction of intracellular parasites. Blocking IL-10 signaling may contribute to the treatment of CanL. In order to obtain a tool for this blockage, the present work endeavored to identify the canine casIL-10R1 amino acid sequence, generate a recombinant baculovirus chromosome encoding this molecule, which was expressed in insect cells and subsequently purified to obtain rcasIL-10R1. In addition, rcasIL-10R1 was able to bind to homologous IL-10 and block IL-10 signaling pathway, as well as to promote lymphoproliferation in dogs with leishmaniasis caused by L. infantum.",

We exposed mice to chronic intermittent ethanol vapor for 4 weeks and used multiparametric flow cytometry to analyze the expression of cytokines IFN-{gamma}, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12 and IL-17 by different immune cells in the blood, spleen and liver of alcohol dependent and non-dependent control mice. We found increases in IFN-{gamma} and IL-17 expression in a cell type- and organ-specific manner. Often, B cells and neutrophils are primary contributors to increased IFN-{gamma} and IL-17 levels while other cell types play a secondary role. We conclude that chronic alcohol exposure promotes systemic pro-inflammatory IFN-{gamma} and IL-17 responses in mice. These responses are likely important in the development of alcohol-related diseases, but further characterization is necessary to understand the initiation and effects of systemic inflammatory responses to chronic alcohol exposure.",

    "abstract": "In order to adjust to changing environmental conditions, bacteria use nucleotide second messengers to transduce external signals and translate them into a specific cellular response. Cyclic di-adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) is the only known essential nucleotide second messenger. In addition to the well-established role of this second messenger in the control of potassium homeostasis, we observed that glutamate is as toxic as potassium for a c-di-AMP-free strain of the Gram-positive model bacterium Bacillus subtilis. In this work, we isolated suppressor mutants that allow growth of a c-di-AMP-free strain under these toxic conditions. Characterization of glutamate resistant suppressors revealed that they contain pairs of mutations, in most cases affecting glutamate and potassium homeostasis. Among these mutations, several independent mutations affected a novel glutamate transporter, AimA (Amino acid importer A, formerly YbeC). This protein is the major transporter for glutamate and serine in B. subtilis. Unexpectedly, some of the isolated suppressor mutants could suppress glutamate toxicity by a combination of mutations that affect phospholipid biosynthesis and a specific gain-of-function mutation of a mechanosensitive channel of small conductance (YfkC) suggesting the acquisition of a device for glutamate export. Cultivation of the c-di-AMP-free strain on complex medium was an even greater challenge because the amounts of potassium, glutamate, and other osmolytes are substantially higher than in minimal mediu. Suppressor mutants viable on complex medium could only be isolated under anaerobic conditions if one of the two c-di-AMP receptor proteins, DarA or DarB, was absent. Also on complex medium, potassium and osmolyte toxicity are the major bottlenecks for the growth of B. subtilis in the absence of c-di-AMP. Our results indicate that the essentiality of c-di-AMP in B. subtilis is caused by the global impact of the second messenger nucleotide on different aspects of cellular physiology.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYBacteria are exposed to constantly changing environmental conditions. In order to respond to these changes, they use nucleotide second messengers to transduce external signals and translate them into a specific cellular response. Among the repertoire of bacterial second messenger nucleotides, cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP) stands out as it is the only second messenger that is essential for the bacteria that produce it, including the Gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis. C-di-AMP plays a major role in the control of potassium homeostasis, and we found that glutamate is toxic to a B. subtilis strain lacking c-di-AMP to the same extent as potassium. These toxic conditions were the starting point for an extensive suppressor analysis, which led to the identification of a novel glutamate transporter (AimA). If the B. subtilis strain lacking c-di-AMP was cultivated on complex medium, the isolation of suppressor mutants was only possible under anaerobic conditions and if either of the two c-di-AMP-binding signal transduction proteins was absent. This suggests that these proteins are a major burden for the cell on complex medium in their c-di-AMP free state. Our result underline the complexity of c-di-AMP signaling and propose new directions for research.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a positive-sense single-stranded virus approximately 30 kb in length, causes the ongoing novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Studies confirmed significant genome differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, suggesting that the distinctions in pathogenicity might be related to genomic diversity. However, the relationship between genomic differences and SARS-CoV-2 fitness has not been fully explained, especially for open reading frame (ORF)-encoded accessory proteins. RNA viruses have a high mutation rate, but how SARS-CoV-2 mutations accelerate adaptation is not clear. This study shows that the host-genome similarity (HGS) of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly higher than that of SARS-CoV, especially in the ORF6 and ORF8 genes encoding proteins antagonizing innate immunity in vivo. A power law relationship was discovered between the HGS of ORF3b, ORF6, and N and the expression of interferon (IFN)-sensitive response element (ISRE)-containing promoters. This finding implies that high HGS of SARS-CoV-2 genome may further inhibit IFN I synthesis and cause delayed host innate immunity. An ORF1ab mutation, 10818G>T, which occurred in virus populations with high HGS but rarely in low-HGS populations, was identified in 2594 genomes with geolocations of China, the USA and Europe. The 10818G>T caused the amino acid mutation M37F in the transmembrane protein nsp6. The results suggest that the ORF6 and ORF8 genes and the mutation M37F may play important roles in causing COVID-19. The findings demonstrate that HGS analysis is a promising way to identify important genes and mutations in adaptive strains, which may help in searching potential targets for pharmaceutical agents.",

    "abstract": "The recognition and disposal of misfolded proteins are essential for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Perturbations in the pathways that promote degradation of aberrant proteins contribute to a variety of protein aggregation disorders broadly termed proteinopathies. It is presently unclear how diverse disease-relevant aggregates are recognized and processed for degradation. The p97 AAA-ATPase in combination with a host of adaptor proteins functions to identify ubiquitylated proteins and target them for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system or through autophagy. Mutations in p97 cause multi-system proteinopathies; however, the precise defects underlying these disorders are unclear given the large number of pathways that rely on p97 function. Here, we systematically investigate the role of p97 and its adaptors in the process of formation of aggresomes which are membrane-less structures containing ubiquitylated proteins that arise upon proteasome inhibition. We demonstrate that p97 mediates both aggresome formation and clearance in proteasome-inhibited cells. We identify a novel and specific role for the p97 adaptor UBXN1 in the process of aggresome formation. UBXN1 is recruited to ubiquitin-positive aggresomes and UBXN1 knockout cells are unable to form a single aggresome, and instead display dispersed ubiquitin aggregates. Furthermore, loss of p97-UBXN1 results in the increase in Huntingtin polyQ aggregates both in mammalian cells as well as in a C.elegans model of Huntingtons Disease. Together our work identifies evolutionarily conserved roles for p97 and its adaptor UBXN1 in the disposal of protein aggregates.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWe compare life histories and selection forces among chimpanzees and human subsistence societies in order to identify the age-specific vital rates that best explain fitness variation, selection pressures and species divergence.\n\nMethodsWe employ Life Table Response Experiments that quantify vital rate contributions to population growth rate differences. Although widespread in ecology, these methods have not been applied to human populations or to look at species differences among humans and chimpanzees. We also estimate correlations between vital rate elasticities and life history traits to investigate differences in selection pressures and test predictions of life history theory.\n\nResultsChimpanzees earlier maturity and higher adult mortality drive species differences, whereas infant mortality and fertility variation drive differences among humans. Human fitness is decoupled from longevity by postreproductive survival, while chimpanzees forfeit higher potential lifetime fertility due to adult mortality attrition. Infant survival is often lower among humans, but lost fitness is recouped via short birth spacing and high peak fertility, thereby reducing selection on infant survival. Lastly, longevity and delayed maturity reduce selection on child survival, but among humans, recruitment selection is unexpectedly highest in longer-lived populations, which are also faster-growing due to high fertility.\n\nConclusionHumans differ from chimpanzees more because of delayed maturity and adult mortality than child mortality or fertility rates. In both species, high child mortality reflects bet-hedging costs of quality/quantity tradeoffs borne by offspring, with high and variable child mortality likely regulating human population growth over evolutionary history. Among human subsistence societies, positive correlations between survival and natural fertility lead selection pressures in human subsistence societies to differ from modern populations undergoing demographic transition, due in part to positive correlations between longevity and natural fertility and negative correlations between recruitment elasticity and reproductive effort.",

    "abstract": "Selection against deleterious mitochondrial mutations is facilitated by germline processes, lowering the risk of genetic diseases. How selection works is disputed: experimental data are conflicting and previous modelling work has not clarified the issues. Here we develop computational and evolutionary models that compare the outcome of selection at the level of individuals, cells and mitochondria. Using realistic de novo mutation rates and germline development parameters, the evolutionary model predicts the observed prevalence of mitochondrial mutations and diseases in human populations. We show the importance of organelle-level selection, seen in the selective pooling of mitochondria into the Balbiani body, in achieving high-quality mitochondria at extreme ploidy in mature oocytes. Alternative mechanisms debated in the literature, bottlenecks and follicular atresia, are unlikely to account for the clinical data, because neither process effectively eliminates mitochondrial mutations under realistic conditions. Our findings explain the major features of female germline architecture, notably the longstanding paradox of over-proliferation of primordial germ cells followed by massive loss. The near-universality of these processes across animal taxa makes sense in light of the need to maintain mitochondrial quality at extreme ploidy in mature oocytes, in the absence of sex and recombination.",

    "abstract": "TOP2-poisoning bioflavonoids and pesticides are linked to the copy number variation-related autism and chromosome translocation-related leukemia. On the other hand, the poisoned DNA topoisomerase II (TOP2) can lead to chromosome aberration. However, except a limited number of genes such as the MLL fusion, other poisoned TOP2-targeted genes, as well as their relationships with any specific diseases, are not defined. We applied the {gamma}H2A.X antibodies to genome-widely immunoprecipitate the chromatins that were associated with the repair of the TOP2 poison etoposide-induced DNA double strand breaks. We identified many transcriptable protein- and nonprotein-coding DNA sequences that are the candidates of or associated with many gene copy number variation- and/or single nucleotide polymorphism-associated diseases, including but not limited to microdeletion and microduplication syndromes (which are phenotypically presented as developmental, autistic, neurological, psychiatric, diabetic, autoimmune, and neoplastic diseases among many others) as well as stature, obesity, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, aortic aneurysm and dissection, leukemia, cancer, osteoporosis, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and Huntington disease. Our data raise the possibility that the poisoned TOP2 might be linked to the specific genetic alterations contributing to these diseases, additional to the known copy number variation-related autism and chromosome translocation-related leukemia. According to our and others data, we propose a model that may interpret the features, such as mosaicism, polygenic traits and pleiotropy, of these diseases.\n\nAuthor SummaryFor the past several decades, the morbidity rate of many diseases, including autism, mental disorders, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and senile dementia, has world-widely been rising. Analysis of the genome of the patients and their family members has identified the genes, whose alterations, so called copy number variation (CNV) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), contribute to the diseases. Moreover, the CNVs and SNPs are de novo, that is, they have occurred only in the recent generations. Epidemiologically, this indicates that for the past several decades, there have existed some unknown world-wide etiologies to which human beings are exposed. If the etiologies are identified, avoiding humans exposure may reduce the morbidity of the diseases. We have found that the repair of the poisoned topoisomerase II involves many genes that contribute to the aforementioned diseases. As the topoisomerase II is known to be located at the genomic sites where the disease-associated CNVs occur, as the poisoned topoisomerase II is susceptible to chromosome aberration, and as the topoisomerase II poisons, such as dietary bioflavonoids, are widely distributed in the environment, our data raise the yet-to-be-confirmed possibility that the environmental topoisomerase II poisons might etiologically contribute to many CNV-associated diseases.",

    "abstract": "Fibrin has been used clinically for wound coverings, surgical glues, and cell delivery because of its affordability, cytocompatibility, and ability to modulate angiogenesis and inflammation. However, its rapid degradation rate has limited its usefulness as a scaffold for 3D cell culture and tissue engineering. Previous studies have sought to slow the degradation rate of fibrin with the addition of proteolysis inhibitors or synthetic crosslinkers that require multiple functionalization or polymerization steps. These strategies are difficult to implement in vivo and introduce increased complexity, both of which hinder the use of fibrin in research and medicine. Previously, we demonstrated that the simple inclusion of bifunctionalized poly(ethylene glycol)-n-hydroxysuccinimide (PEG-NHS) in the fibrinogen solvent slows the degradation rate of fibrin by providing additional crosslinking. In this study, we aimed to further improve the longevity of fibrin gels such that they could be used for tissue engineering in vitro or in situ without the need for proteolysis inhibitors. It is well documented that increasing the salinity of fibrin precursor solutions affects the resulting gel morphology. In this study, we investigated whether this altered morphology influences the fibrin degradation rate. Increasing the final sodium chloride (NaCl) concentration from 145 mM (physiologic level) to 250 mM resulted in fine, transparent high-salt (HS) fibrin gels that degrade 2-3 times slower than coarse, opaque physiologic-salt (PS) fibrin gels both in vitro (when treated with proteases and when seeded with amniotic fluid stem cells) and in vivo (when injected subcutaneously into mice). Increased salt concentrations did not affect the viability of encapsulated cells, the ability of encapsulated endothelial cells to form rudimentary capillary networks, or the ability of the gels to maintain induced pluripotent stem cells. Finally, when implanted subcutaneously, PS gels degraded completely within one week while HS gels remained stable and maintained viability of seeded dermal fibroblasts. To our knowledge, this is the simplest method reported for the fabrication of fibrin gels with tunable degradation properties and will be useful for implementing fibrin gels in a wide range of research and clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Transition from mitosis to meiosis in cell division is a fundamental process of gametogenesis. This transition is thought to be largely controlled by the exchange of relative dominance between positive and negative regulation by the retinoic acid/Stra8 signal cascade and a non-canonical PRC1 (PRC1.6), respectively. We have previously demonstrated that germ cells have transcriptionally and/or post-translationally reduced levels of MAX, a component of PRC1.6, immediately prior to meiotic onset, leading to alleviation of the negative effect of PRC1.6 against meiotic onset. Here, we found that germ cells produced Mga variant mRNA bearing a premature termination codon (PTC) during meiosis as an additional mechanism to impede the function of PRC1.6. Our data indicated that spermatocytes and/or round spermatids produced an anomalous MGA protein lacking the bHLHZ domain from the variant mRNA and therefore functioned as a dominant negative regulator of PRC1.6 by exquisitely using their inefficient background of PTC-mediated nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Thus, our data indicate that meiotic onset of male germ cells is controlled in a multi-layered manner in which both MAX and MGA, which constitute the core of PRC1.6 by their interaction, are at least used as targets to deteriorate the integrity of the complex to ensure initiation of meiosis.\n\nSignificance StatementPRC1.6, a non-canonical PRC1, functions as a strong blocker of meiotic onset. Therefore, germ cells need to alleviate the function of the complex as a prerequisite for meiotic onset. The MGA/MAX heterodimer not only constitutes a core of PRC1.6, but also confers direct DNA-binding activity to the complex. We have previously demonstrated that germ cells reduce Max amounts prior to meiotic onset to inactivate PRC1.6. In this study, we explored the possibility of an additional molecular mechanism that promotes meiotic onset via impediment of PRC1.6 functions as a safeguard system. Here, we demonstrate that meiotic germ cells specifically generate variant Mga mRNA by alternative splicing, which leads to production of a dominant negative regulator of PRC1.6.",
