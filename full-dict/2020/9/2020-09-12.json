    "abstract": "Plant growth, development, and nutritional quality depends upon amino acid homeostasis, especially in seeds. However, our understanding of the underlying genetics influencing amino acid content and composition remains limited, with only a few candidate genes and quantitative trait loci identified to date. Improved knowledge of the genetics and biological processes that determine amino acid levels will enable researchers to use this information for plant breeding and biological discovery. Towards this goal, we used genomic prediction to identify biological processes that are associated with, and therefore potentially influence, free amino acid (FAA) composition in seeds of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Markers were split into categories based on metabolic pathway annotations and fit using a genomic partitioning model to evaluate the influence of each pathway on heritability explained, model fit, and predictive ability. Selected pathways included processes known to influence FAA composition, albeit to an unknown degree, and spanned four categories: amino acid, core, specialized, and protein metabolism. Using this approach, we identified associations for pathways containing known variants for FAA traits, in addition to finding new trait-pathway associations. Markers related to amino acid metabolism, which are directly involved in the FAA regulation, improved predictive ability for branched chain amino acids and histidine. The use of genomic partitioning also revealed patterns across biochemical families, in which serine-derived FAAs were associated with protein related annotations and aromatic FAAs were associated with specialized metabolic pathways. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that genomic partitioning is a viable strategy to uncover the relative contributions of biological processes to FAA traits in seeds, offering a promising framework to guide hypothesis testing and narrow the search space for candidate genes.",

    "abstract": "Dispersal is an important form of movement influencing population dynamics, species distribution, and gene flow between populations. In population models, dispersal is often included in a simplified manner by removing a random proportion of the population. Many ecologists now argue that models should be formulated at the level of individuals instead of the population-level. To fully understand the effects of dispersal on natural systems, it is therefore necessary to incorporate individual-level differences in dispersal behaviour in population models. Here we parameterised an integral projection model (IPM), which allows for studying how individual life histories determine population-level processes, using bulb mites, Rhizoglyphus robini, to assess to what extent dispersal expression (frequency of individuals in the dispersal stage) and dispersal probability affect the proportion of dispersers and natal population growth rate. We find that allowing for life-history differences between resident phenotypes and disperser phenotypes shows that multiple combinations of dispersal probability and dispersal expression can produce the same proportion of leaving individuals. Additionally, a given proportion of dispersing individuals results in different natal population growth rates. The results highlight that dispersal life histories, and the frequency with which disperser phenotypes occur in the natal population, significantly affect population-level processes. Thus, biological realism of dispersal population models can be increased by incorporating the typically observed life history differences between resident phenotypes and disperser phenotypes, and we here present a methodology to do so.",

    "abstract": "The dynamic process of mitotic spindle assembly depends on multitudes of inter-dependent interactions involving kinetochores (KTs), microtubules (MTs), spindle pole bodies (SPBs), and molecular motors. Before forming the mitotic spindle, multiple visible microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) coalesce into a single focus to serve as a SPB in the pathogenic budding yeast, Cryptococcus neoformans. To explain this unusual phenomenon in the fungal kingdom, we propose a  search and capture model, in which cytoplasmic MTs (cMTs) nucleated by MTOCs grow and capture each other to promote MTOC clustering. Our quantitative modeling identifies multiple redundant mechanisms mediated by a combination of cMT-cell cortex interactions and inter-cMT coupling to facilitate MTOC clustering within the physiological time limit as determined by time-lapse live-cell microscopy. Besides, we screen various possible mechanisms by computational modeling and propose optimal conditions that favor proper spindle positioning - a critical determinant for timely chromosome segregation. These analyses also reveal that a combined effect of MT buckling, dynein pull, and cortical push maintains spatiotemporal spindle localization.",

    "abstract": "Island species and habitats are particularly vulnerable to human disturbances, and anthropogenic changes are increasingly overwriting natural island biogeographic patterns. However, quantitative comparisons of how native and alien assemblages respond to human disturbances are scarce. Using data from 6,242 species of vertebrates, invertebrates and plants, from 7,718 sites on 81 islands, we model how land-use change, human population density and distance to the nearest road affect local assemblages of alien and native species on islands. We found that land-use change reduces both richness and abundance of native species, whereas the number and abundance of alien species are high in plantation forests and agricultural or urban sites. In contrast to the long-established pattern for native species (i.e., decline in species number with island isolation), more isolated islands have more alien species across most land uses than do less isolated islands. We show that alien species play a major role in the turnover of island assemblages: our models show that aliens outnumber natives among the species present at disturbed sites but absent from minimally-disturbed primary vegetation. Finally, we found a homogenization pattern for both native and alien assemblages across sites within most land uses. The declines of native species on islands in the face of human pressures, and the particular proneness to invasions of the more remote islands, highlight the need to reduce the intensity of human pressures on islands and to prevent the introduction and establishment of alien species.",

We provide a brief overview on the homeostasis of human RBCs and on the general biophysical principles guiding the modelling design. By way of a detailed tutorial we apply the model to investigate in depth the multiple effects associated with RBC dehydration induced by potassium permeabilization, a necessary preliminary for understanding the pathophysiology of a wide group of inherited haemolytic anaemias, a subject of intense current research and clinical interest. Using the red cell model (RCM), we design and run in silico representations of experimental protocols to study global RBC responses to calcium and potassium permeabilization covering a wide range of experimental, physiological and pathological conditions. Model outputs report the evolution in time of all the homeostatic variables in the system allowing, for the first time, a detailed and comprehensive account of the complex processes shaping global cell responses. Analysis of the results explains the mechanisms by which the entangled operation of all the RBC components link cell dehydration and protein crowding to cell acidification and to the generation of hypertonic, alkaline effluents. Open access to the RCM in a GitHub repository, together with the tutorial primed for a specific investigation pave the way for researchers and clinicians to apply the model on many different aspects of RBC physiology and pathology.",

    "abstract": "The current global pandemic of COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) is the critical determinant of viral tropism and infectivity. To investigate whether naturally occurring mutations in the RBD during the early transmission phase have altered the receptor binding affinity and infectivity, firstly we analyzed in silico the binding dynamics between mutated SARS-CoV-2 RBDs and the human ACE2 receptor. Among 32,123 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates (January through March, 2020), 302 non-synonymous RBD mutants were identified and clustered into 96 mutant types. The six dominant mutations were analyzed applying molecular dynamics simulations. The mutant type V367F continuously circulating worldwide displayed higher binding affinity to human ACE2 due to the enhanced structural stabilization of the RBD beta-sheet scaffold. The increased infectivity of V367 mutants was further validated by performing receptor-ligand binding ELISA, surface plasmon resonance, and pseudotyped virus assays. Genome phylogenetic analysis of V367F mutants showed that during the early transmission phase, most V367F mutants clustered more closely with the SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain than the dual-mutation variants (V367F + D614G) which emerged later and formed a distinct sub-cluster. The analysis of critical RBD mutations provides further insights into the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 under negative selection pressure and supports the continuing surveillance of spike mutations to aid in the development of new COVID-19 drugs and vaccines.\n\nImportanceA novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused the pandemic of COVID-19. The origin of SARS-CoV-2 was associated with zoonotic infections. The spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) is identified as the critical determinant of viral tropism and infectivity. Thus, whether the mutations in the RBD of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 isolates have altered the receptor binding affinity and caused them more infectious, should be paid more attentions to. Given that SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus, the significance of our research is in identifying and validating the RBD mutant types emerging during the early transmission phase that have increased human ACE2 receptor binding affinity and infectivity. The RBD mutation analysis provides insights into SARS-CoV-2 evolution. The continuous surveillance of RBD mutations with increased human ACE2 affinity in human or other animals is important and necessary, particularly when the direct correlation between the virus variations and vaccine effectiveness is underdetermined during the sustained COVID-19 pandemic.",

The Drosophila embryonic axis extension requires planar polarized enrichment of Myosin-II powering oriented cell intercalations. Myosin-II levels are quantitatively controlled by G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling whereas Myosin-II polarity requires patterned expression of several Toll receptors. How Toll receptors polarizes Myosin-II, and how this involves GPCRs, remain unknown. Here we report that differential expression of a single Toll receptor, Toll-8, polarizes Myosin-II via a novel binding partner, the adhesion GPCR Cirl/Latrophilin. Asymmetric expression of Cirl is sufficient to enrich Myosin-II and Cirl localization is asymmetric at Toll-8 expression boundaries. Exploring the process dynamically, we reveal that Toll-8 and Cirl exhibit mutually dependent planar polarity in response to quantitative differences in Toll-8 expression between neighboring cells. Collectively, we propose that a novel cell surface protein complex Toll-8/Cirl self-organizes to generate local asymmetric interfaces essential for planar polarization of contractile interfaces.",

To address these issues, we developed a two-stage marker-assisted strategy in which embryos are injected with RNPs and pre-screened using T7EI. Using sgRNA in complex with recombinant Cas9 protein, we assayed each sgRNA for genome-cutting efficiency. We then conducted HDR using sgRNAs that efficiently cut target genes and the application of a transformation marker that generates RNAi against eyes absent. This allows for screening based on eye morphology rather than color. These new tools can be used to make a single change or a series of allelic substitutions in a region of interest, or to create additional genetic tools such as balancer chromosomes.",

    "abstract": "Digital analysis of pathology whole-slide images is fast becoming a game changer in cancer diagnosis and treatment. Specifically, deep learning methods have shown great potential to support pathology analysis, with recent studies identifying molecular traits that were not previously recognized on pathology H&E whole-slide images. Simultaneous to these developments, it is becoming increasingly evident that tumor heterogeneity is an important determinant of cancer prognosis and susceptibility to treatment, and should therefore play a role in the evolving practices of matching treatment protocols to patients. State of the art diagnostic procedures, however, do not provide automated methods for characterizing and/or quantifying tumor heterogeneity, certainly not in a spatial context. Further, existing methods for analyzing pathology whole-slide images from bulk measurements require many training samples and complex pipelines. Our work addresses these two challenges. First, we train deep learning models to spatially resolve bulk mRNA and miRNA expression levels on pathology whole-slide images (WSIs). Our models reach up to 0.95 AUC on held-out test sets from two cancer cohorts using a simple training pipeline and a small number of training samples. Using the inferred gene expression levels, we further develop a method to spatially characterize tumor heterogeneity. Specifically, we produce tumor molecular cartographies and heterogeneity maps of WSIs and formulate a heterogeneity index (HTI) that quantifies the level of heterogeneity within these maps. Applying our methods to breast and lung cancer slides, we show a significant statistical link between heterogeneity and survival. Our methods potentially open a new and accessible approach to investigating tumor heterogeneity and other spatial molecular properties and their link to clinical characteristics, including treatment susceptibility and survival.",

    "abstract": "Identifying the genetic variations impacting human brain structure and their further effects on cognitive functions, is important for our understanding of the fundamental bases of cognition. In this study, we take two different approaches to this issue: classical genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) and a relatedness-based regression approach (REL) to search for associations between genotype and brain structural measures of gray matter and white matter. Instead of searching genetic variants by testing the association between a phenotype trait and the genotype of each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) as in GWAS, REL takes advantage of multiple SNPs within a genomic window as a single measure, which potentially find associations wherever the functional SNP is in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with SNPs that have been sampled. We also conducted a simulation analysis to systemically compare GWAS and REL with respect to different levels of LD. Both methods succeed in identifying genetic variations associated with regional and global brain structural measures and tend to give complementary results due to the different aspects of genetic properties used. Simulation results suggest that GWAS outperforms REL when the signal is relatively weak. However, the collective effects due to local LD boost the performance of REL with increasing signal strength, resulting in better performance than GWAS. Our study suggests that the optimal approach may vary across the genome and that pre-testing for LD could allow GWAS to be preferred where LD is high and REL to be used where LD is low, or the local pattern of LD is complex.",

    "abstract": "The way people choose routes through unfamiliar environments provides clues about the underlying representation they use. One way to test the nature of observers representation is to manipulate the structure of the scene as they move through it and measure which aspects of performance are significantly affected and which are not. We recorded the routes that participants took in virtual mazes to reach previously-viewed targets. The mazes were either physically realizable or impossible (the latter contained  wormholes that altered the layout of the scene without any visible change at that moment). We found that participants could usually find the shortest route between remembered objects even in physically impossible environments, despite the gross failures in pointing that an earlier study showed are evident in the physically impossible environment. In the physically impossible conditions, the choice made at a junction was influenced to a greater extent by whether that choice had, in the past, led to the discovery of a target (compared to a shortest-distance prediction). In the physically realizable mazes, on the other hand, junction choices were determined more by the shortest distance to the target. This pattern of results is compatible with the idea of a graph-like representation of space that can include information about previous success or failure for traversing each edge and also information about the distance between nodes. Our results suggest that complexity of the maze may dictate which of these is more important in influencing navigational choices.",

    "abstract": "Competent social functioning of group-living species relies on the ability of individuals to detect and utilize conspecific social cues to guide behavior. Previous studies have identified numerous brain regions involved in processing these external cues, collectively referred to as the Social Decision-Making Network. However, how the brain encodes social information with respect to an individuals social status has not been thoroughly examined. In mice, cues about an individuals identity, including social status, are conveyed through urinary proteins. In this study, we assessed the neural cFos immunoreactivity in dominant and subordinate male mice exposed to familiar and unfamiliar dominant and subordinate male urine. The posteroventral medial amygdala was the only brain region that responded exclusively to dominant compared to subordinate male urine. In all other brain regions, including the VMH, PMv, and vlPAG, activity is modulated by a combination of odor familiarity and the social status of both the urine donor and the subject receiving the cue. We show that dominant subjects exhibit robust differential activity across different types of cues compared to subordinate subjects, suggesting that individuals perceive social cues differently depending on social experience. These data inform further investigation of neurobiological mechanisms underlying social-status related brain differences and behavior.",

    "abstract": "Recombination has been shown to contribute to HIV-1 evolution in vivo, but the underlying dynamics are extremely complex, depending on the nature of the fitness landscapes and of epistatic interactions. A less well-studied determinant of recombinant evolution is the mode of virus transmission in the cell population. HIV-1 can spread by free virus transmission, resulting largely in singly infected cells, and also by direct cell-to-cell transmission, resulting in the simultaneous infection of cells with multiple viruses. We investigate the contribution of these two transmission pathways to recombinant evolution, by applying mathematical models to in vitro experimental data on the growth of fluorescent reporter viruses under static conditions (where both transmission pathways operate), and under gentle shaking conditions, where cell-to-cell transmission is largely inhibited. The parameterized mathematical models are then used to extrapolate the viral evolutionary dynamics beyond the experimental settings. Assuming a fixed basic reproductive ratio of the virus (independent of transmission pathway), we find that recombinant evolution is fastest if virus spread is driven only by cell-to-cell transmission, and slows down if both transmission pathways operate. Recombinant evolution is slowest if all virus spread occurs through free virus transmission. This is due to cell-to-cell transmission (i) increasing infection multiplicity, (ii) promoting the co-transmission of different virus strains from cell to cell, and (iii) increasing the rate at which point mutations are generated as a result of more reverse transcription events. This work further resulted in the estimation of various parameters that characterize these evolutionary processes. For example, we estimate that during cell-to-cell transmission, an average of 3 viruses successfully integrated into the target cell, which can significantly raise the infection multiplicity compared to free virus transmission. In general, our study points towards the importance of infection multiplicity and cell-to-cell transmission for HIV-evolution.",

Here, we examined the manifestations of the COVID-19 outbreak on the brain structure in the healthy population, following the initial phase of the pandemic in Israel. We pre-registered our hypothesis that the intense experience of the outbreak potentially induced stress-related brain modifications. Volumetric changes in n = 50 participants who were scanned before and after the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown, were compared with n = 50 control participants who were scanned twice prior to the pandemic. The pandemic provided a rare opportunity to examine brain plasticity in a natural experiment. We found volumetric increases in bilateral amygdalae, putamen, and the anterior temporal cortices. Changes in the amygdalae diminished as time elapsed from lockdown relief, suggesting that the intense experience associated with the pandemic outbreak induced transient volumetric changes in brain regions commonly associated with stress and anxiety.",

    "abstract": "Interactomes embody one of the most effective representations of cellular behavior by revealing function through protein associations. In order to build these models at the organism scale, high-throughput techniques are required to identify interacting pairs of proteins. Next-generation interaction screening (NGIS) protocols that combine yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) with deep sequencing are promising approaches to generate protein-protein interaction networks in any organism. However, challenges remain to mining reliable information from these screens and thus, limit its broader implementation. Here, we describe a statistical framework, designated Y2H-SCORES, for analyzing high-throughput Y2H screens that considers key aspects of experimental design, normalization, and controls. Three quantitative ranking scores were implemented to identify interacting partners, comprising: 1) significant enrichment under selection for positive interactions, 2) degree of interaction specificity among multi-bait comparisons, and 3) selection of in-frame interactors. Using simulation and an empirical dataset, we provide a quantitative assessment to predict interacting partners under a wide range of experimental scenarios, facilitating independent confirmation by one-to-one bait-prey tests. Simulation of Y2H-NGIS identified conditions that maximize detection of true interactors, which can be achieved with protocols such as prey library normalization, maintenance of larger culture volumes and replication of experimental treatments. Y2H-SCORES can be implemented in different yeast-based interaction screenings, accelerating the biological interpretation of experimental results. Proof-of-concept was demonstrated by discovery and validation of a novel interaction between the barley powdery mildew effector, AVRA13, with the vesicle-mediated thylakoid membrane biogenesis protein, HvTHF1.\n\nAuthor SummaryOrganisms respond to their environment through networks of interacting proteins and other biomolecules. In order to investigate these interacting proteins, many in vitro and in vivo techniques have been used. Among these, yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) has been integrated with next generation sequencing (NGS) to approach protein-protein interactions on a genome-wide scale. The fusion of these two methods has been termed next-generation-interaction screening, abbreviated as Y2H-NGIS. However, the massive and diverse data sets resulting from this technology have presented unique challenges to analysis. To address these challenges, we optimized the computational and statistical evaluation of Y2H-NGIS to provide metrics to identify high-confidence interacting proteins under a variety of dataset scenarios. Our proposed framework can be extended to different yeast-based interaction settings, utilizing the general principles of enrichment, specificity, and in-frame prey selection to accurately assemble protein-protein interaction networks. Lastly, we showed how the pipeline works experimentally, by identifying and validating a novel interaction between the barley powdery mildew effector AVRA13 and the barley vesicle-mediated thylakoid membrane biogenesis protein, HvTHF1.

The morphology of spines has been implicated in their function in synaptic plasticity and their shapes have been well-characterized, but the potential mechanics underlying their shape development and maintenance have not yet been fully understood. In this work, we explore the mechanical principles that could underlie specific shapes using a minimal biophysical model of membrane-actin interactions. Using this model, we first identify the possible force regimes that give rise to the classic spine shapes - stubby, filopodia, thin, and mushroom-shaped spines. We also use this model to investigate how the spine neck might be stabilized using periodic rings of actin or associated proteins. Finally, we use this model to predict that the cooperation between force generation and ring structures can regulate the energy landscape of spine shapes across a wide range of tensions. Thus, our study provides insights into how mechanical aspects of actin-mediated force generation and tension can play critical roles in spine shape maintenance.",

In this work, we developed a powerful experimental and analytical toolbox to enable genome-wide scale discovery and targeted validation of cellular communication. We assessed the utilities of five sequencing and imaging technologies to study cancer tissue, including single-cell RNA sequencing and Spatial Transcriptomic (measuring over >20,000 genes), RNA In Situ Hybridization (multiplex 4-12 genes), digital droplet PCR, and Opal multiplex protein staining (4-9 proteins). To spatially integrate multimodal data, we developed a computational method called STRISH that can automatically scan across the whole tissue section for local expression of gene and/or protein markers to recapitulate an interaction landscape across the whole tissue. We evaluated the unique ability of this toolbox to discover and validate cell-cell interaction in situ through in-depth analysis of two types of cancer, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, which account for over 70% of cancer cases. We expect that the approach described here will be widely applied to discover and validate ligand receptor interaction in different types of solid cancer tumors.",

    "abstract": "Neurons rely on localized mitochondria to fulfill spatially heterogeneous metabolic demands. Mitochondrial aging occurs on timescales shorter than the neuronal lifespan, necessitating transport of fresh material from the soma. Maintaining an optimal distribution of healthy mitochondria requires an interplay between a stationary pool localized to sites of high metabolic demand and a motile pool capable of delivering new material. Interchange between these pools can occur via transient fusion / fission events or by halting and restarting entire mitochondria. Our quantitative model of neuronal mitostasis identifies key parameters that govern steady-state mitochondrial health at discrete locations. Very infrequent exchange between stationary and motile pools optimizes this system. Exchange via transient fusion allows for robust maintenance, which can be further improved by selective recycling through mitophagy. These results provide a framework for quantifying how perturbations in organelle transport and interactions affect mitochondrial homeostasis in neurons, a key aspect underlying many neurodegenerative disorders.\n\nAuthor summaryNeurons contain long projections termed axons and dendrites and a small central body that is responsible for much of cellular biosynthesis. Mitochondria, the energy hubs of a cell, are synthesized in the soma and actively transported to distant sites of high energy demand. Given the extreme distances between these sites and the soma, maintaining distal mitochondrial health poses a substantial challenge. Defects in mitochondrial transport and maintenance are associated with several neurological disorders.\n\nFortunately, mitochondria stationed at distant sites can be  serviced by passing mitochondria that emerge from the soma and move around the neuron, as well as through low levels of local protein synthesis. We develop mathematical models for two strategies of mitochondrial maintenance: one with direct protein exchange between moving and stationary mitochondria ( Space Station) and the other with moving mitchondria occasionally replacing stationary ones at the demand sites ( Changing of the Guard). We find that only a few servicing events and a small motile pool form optimal conditions for maintaining mitochondrial health. The system can be improved further by selectively removing and recycling some unhealthy mitochondria. Our results are consistent with observations of mitochondrial behavior in neurons and form a basis for future quantitative study of mitochondrial maintenance.",

Data Dependent Acquisition (DDA) chooses which ions to fragment based upon intensity observed in MS1 survey scans and typically only fragment a small subset of the ions present. Despite this inefficiency, relatively little work has addressed the development of new DDA methods, partly due to the high overhead associated with running the many extracts necessary to optimise approaches in busy MS facilities. In this work, we firstly provide theoretical results that show how much improvement is possible over current DDA strategies. We then describe an in silico framework for fast and cost efficient development of new DDA acquisition strategies using a previously developed Virtual Metabolomics Mass Spectrometer (ViMMS). Additional functionality is added to ViMMS to allow methods to be used both in simulation and on real samples via an instrument application programming interface (API).\n\nWe demonstrate this framework through the development and optimisation of two new DDA methods which introduce new advanced ion prioritisation strategies. Upon application of the here developed methods to two complex metabolite mixtures, our results show that they are able to fragment more unique ions than standard DDA acquisition strategies.",

Since eukaryotic genomes encode thousands of proteins, testing their interactions one-by-one is a challenging prospect. High-throughput yeast-two hybrid (Y2H) assays that employ next-generation sequencing to interrogate cDNA libraries represent an alternative approach that optimizes scale, cost, and effort. We present NGPINT, a robust and scalable software to identify all putative interactors of a protein using Y2H in batch culture. NGPINT combines diverse tools to align sequence reads to target genomes, reconstruct prey fragments and compute gene enrichment under reporter selection. Central to this pipeline is the identification of fusion reads containing sequences derived from both the Y2H expression plasmid and the cDNA of interest. To reduce false positives, these fusion reads are evaluated as to whether the cDNA fragment forms an in-frame translational fusion with the Y2H transcription factor. NGPINT successfully recognized 95% of interactions in simulated test runs. As proof of concept, NGPINT was tested using published data sets and recognized all validated interactions. NGPINT can be used in any organism with an available reference, thus facilitating the discovery of protein-protein interactions in non-model organisms.",

    "abstract": "Plant growth depends on the diurnal regulation of cellular processes, but it is not well understood if and how transcriptional regulation controls diurnal fluctuations at the protein-level. Here we report a high-resolution Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) leaf rosette proteome acquired over a 12 h light : 12 h dark diurnal cycle and the phosphoproteome immediately before and after the light-to-dark and dark-to-light transitions. We quantified nearly 5000 proteins and 800 phosphoproteins, of which 288 fluctuated in their abundance and 226 fluctuated in their phosphorylation status. Of the phosphoproteins, 60% were quantified for changes in protein abundance. This revealed six proteins involved in nitrogen and hormone metabolism that had concurrent changes in both protein abundance and phosphorylation status. The diurnal proteome and phosphoproteome changes involve proteins in key cellular processes, including protein translation, light perception, photosynthesis, metabolism and transport. The phosphoproteome at the light-dark transitions revealed the dynamics at phosphorylation sites in either anticipation of or response to a change in light regime. Phosphorylation site motif analyses implicate casein kinase II and calcium/calmodulin dependent kinases among the primary light-dark transition kinases. The comparative analysis of the diurnal proteome and diurnal and circadian transcriptome established how mRNA and protein accumulation intersect in leaves during the diurnal cycle of the plant.\n\nSummary StatementThe manuscript provides quantitative information of diurnal changes in the accumulation and phosphorylation of proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana rosettes grown in a 12 h photoperiod.

    "abstract": "The genus Rumex is a unique member of the Polygonaceae (Buckwheat) family of plants. A source of intrigue for Rumex lies in the diversity of the reproductive systems associated with the subgenera, species, and subspecies within this genus. Four previously circumscribed subgenera, some 200 species, and a number of subspecies comprise the collective Rumex genus. These species exhibit monoecious, dioecious, synoecious (hermaphroditic), and polygamous reproductive systems. Moreover, some of the dioecious species contain sex chromosomes, a phenomenon that is very rare in angiosperms. Apart from the confirmed morphological and phytogeographical distinctions, two of the four described subgenera, Acetosa and Acetosella, are distinctive in their exhibited sex chromosome systems. For this study, we used three chloroplast markers, rbcL, trnH-psbA, trnL-F, and dense taxon sampling, to reconstruct a molecular phylogeny for Rumex.The reconstructed phylogeny for this work resolves six major clades and one large grade in Rumex. In addition, the species with known dioecious reproductive systems derived from unique sex chromosome systems are resolved in two different clades nested within \"the dioecious clade\". These results suggest that the species with divergent sexual systems are more closely related to each other than to other species comprising the rest of the Rumex genus. Furthermore, some species with known synoecious reproductive systems are resolved in a single clade which is also nested within \"the dioecious clade\". These results imply a possible reversal occurring over time which suggests the highly plastic nature of reproductive systems among Rumex species.",

    "abstract": "There is a widespread assumption that there are a static set of  language regions in the brain. Yet, people still regularly produce familiar  formulaic expressions when those regions are severely damaged. This suggests that the neurobiology of language varies with the extent of word sequence learning and might not be fixed. We test the hypothesis that perceiving sentences is mostly supported by sensorimotor regions involved in speech production and not  language regions after overlearning. Twelve participants underwent two sessions of behavioural testing and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), separated by 15 days. During this period, they repeated two sentences 30 times each, twice a day. In both fMRI sessions, participants  passively listened to those two sentences and novel sentences. Lastly, they spoke novel sentences. Behavioural results confirm that participants overlearned sentences. Correspondingly, there was an increase or recruitment of sensorimotor regions involved in sentence production and a reduction in activity or inactivity for overlearned sentences in regions involved in listening to novel sentences. The global network organization of the brain changed by [~]45%, mostly through lost connectivity. Thus, there was a profound reorganization of the neurobiology of speech perception after overlearning towards sensorimotor regions not considered in most contemporary models and away from the  language regions posited by those models. These same sensorimotor regions are generally preserved in aphasia and Alzheimers disease, perhaps explaining residual abilities with formulaic language. These and other results warrant reconsidering static neurobiological models of language.",

    "abstract": "Many ideas about the evolution of specialization rely on trade-offs--an inability for one organism to express maximal performance in two or more environments. However, optimal foraging theory suggests that populations can evolve specialization on a superior resource without explicit trade-offs. Classical results in population genetics show that the process of adaptation can be biased toward further improvement in already productive environments, potentially widening the gap between superior and inferior resources. Here I synthesize these approaches with new insights on evolvability at low recombination rates, showing that emergent asymmetries in evolvability can push a population toward specialization in the absence of trade-offs. Simulations are used to demonstrate how adaptation to a more common environment interferes with adaptation to a less common but otherwise equal alternative environment. Shaped by recombination rates and other population-genetic parameters, this process results in either the retention of a generalist niche without trade-offs or entrapment at the local optimum of specialization on the common environment. These modeling results predict that transient differences in evolvability across traits during an episode of adaptation could have long-term consequences for a populations niche.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCis-regulatory elements such as enhancers and promoters are crucial for directing gene expression in the human heart. Dysregulation of these elements can result in many cardiovascular diseases that are major leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In addition, genetic variants associated with cardiovascular disease risk are enriched within cis-regulatory elements. However, the location and activity of these cis-regulatory elements in individual cardiac cell types remains to be fully defined.\n\nMethodsWe performed single nucleus ATAC-seq and single nucleus RNA-seq to define a comprehensive catalogue of candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) and gene expression patterns for the distinct cell types comprising each chamber of four non-failing human hearts. We used this catalogue to computationally deconvolute dynamic enhancers in failing hearts and to assign cardiovascular disease risk variants to cCREs in individual cardiac cell types. Finally, we applied reporter assays, genome editing and electrophysiogical measurements in in vitro differentiated human cardiomyocytes to validate the molecular mechanisms of cardiovascular disease risk variants.\n\nResultsWe defined >287,000 candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) in human hearts at single-cell resolution, which notably revealed gene regulatory programs controlling specific cell types in a cardiac region/structure-dependent manner and during heart failure. We further report enrichment of cardiovascular disease risk variants in cCREs of distinct cardiac cell types, including a strong enrichment of atrial fibrillation variants in cardiomyocyte cCREs, and reveal 38 candidate causal atrial fibrillation variants localized to cardiomyocyte cCREs. Two such risk variants residing within a cardiomyocyte-specific cCRE at the KCNH2/HERG locus resulted in reduced enhancer activity compared to the non-risk allele. Finally, we found that deletion of the cCRE containing these variants decreased KCNH2 expression and prolonged action potential repolarization in an enhancer dosage-dependent manner.\n\nConclusionsThis comprehensive atlas of human cardiac cCREs provides the foundation for not only illuminating cell type-specific gene regulatory programs controlling human hearts during health and disease, but also interpreting genetic risk loci for a wide spectrum of cardiovascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "Biochemical and biological functions of proteins are the product of both the overall fold of the polypeptide chain, and, typically, structural motifs made up of smaller numbers of amino acids constituting a catalytic center or a binding site. Detection of such structural motifs can provide valuable insights into the function(s) of previously uncharacterized proteins. Technically, this remains an extremely challenging problem because of the size of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) archive. Existing methods depend on a clustering by sequence similarity and can be computationally slow. We have developed a new approach that uses an inverted index strategy capable of analyzing >160,000 PDB structures with unmatched speed. The efficiency of the inverted index method depends critically on identifying the small number of structures containing the query motif and ignoring most of the structures that are irrelevant. Our approach (implemented at motif.rcsb.org) enables real-time retrieval and superposition of structural motifs, either extracted from a reference structure or uploaded by the user. Herein, we describe the method and present five case studies that exemplify its efficacy and speed for analyzing 3D structures of both proteins and nucleic acids.\n\nAuthor summaryThe Protein Data Bank (PDB) provides open access to more than 160,000 three-dimensional structures of proteins, nucleic acids, and biological complexes. Similarities between PDB structures give valuable functional and evolutionary insights but such resemblance may not be evident at sequence or global structure level. Throughout the database, there are recurring structural motifs - groups of modest numbers of residues in proximity that, for example, support catalytic activity. Identification of common structural motifs can unveil subtle similarities between proteins and serve as fingerprints for configurations such as the His-Asp-Ser catalytic triad found in serine proteases or the zinc coordination site found in Zinc Finger DNA-binding domains. We present a highly efficient yet flexible strategy that allows users for the first time to search for arbitrary structural motifs across the entire PDB archive in real-time. Our approach scales favorably with the increasing number and complexity of deposited structures, and, also, has the potential to be adapted for other applications in a macromolecular context.",

The prediction accuracy of these estimation methods is highly dependent on the covariance structure, which is characterized by gene regulation networks. However, the manner in which the structure of a gene regulation network together with the sample size affects prediction accuracy has not yet been sufficiently investigated. In this study, Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to investigate the prediction accuracy for several network structures under various sample sizes.\n\nResultsWhen the gene regulation network was random graph, the simulation indicated that models with high estimation accuracy could be achieved with small sample sizes. However, a real gene regulation network is likely to exhibit a scale-free structure. In such cases, the simulation indicated that a relatively large number of observations is required to accurately predict traits from a transcriptome.\n\nAvailability and implementationSource code at https://github.com/keihirose/simrnet\n\nContacthirose@imi.kyushu-u.ac.jp",

    "abstract": "The understanding of the dynamics of stomatal movements has increased substantially through genetic manipulation of plant metabolism either at the whole plant level or specifically in guard cells. However, the regulation of stomatal speediness remains not completely elucidated. Here we shown that reduced expression of guard cell sucrose synthase 2 (NtSUS2) of Nicotiana tabacum L. altered the topology and the connectivity of the guard cell metabolic network and the accumulation of metabolites positively correlated with stomatal speediness during dark-to-light transition. This leads to a slower light-induced stomatal opening, lower steady-state stomatal conductance and a strong reduction (up to 44%) in daily whole plant transpiration in the transgenics, when compared to wild type plants. Furthermore, the transgenic lines transpired more or have lower reduction in whole plant transpiration under short water deficit periods, indicating a higher effective use of water under this condition. Our results collectively suggest that the regulation of stomatal movement and speediness involve a complex modulation of the guard cell metabolic network, in which NtSUS2 has an important role. The results are discussed on the role of guard cell metabolism for the regulation of both stomatal speediness and whole plant transpiration.",

    "abstract": "Plant ecophysiology is founded on a rich body of physical and chemical theory, but it is challenging to connect theory with data in unambiguous, analytically rigorous, and reproducible ways. Custom scripts written in computer programming languages (coding) enable plant ecophysiologists to model plant processes and fit models to data reproducibly using advanced statistical techniques. Since many ecophysiologists lack formal programming education, we have yet to adopt a unified set of coding principles and standards that could make coding easier to learn, use, and modify. We identify eight principles to help in plant ecophysiologists without much programming experience to write resilient code: 1) standardized nomenclature, 2) consistency in style, 3) increased modularity/extensibility for easier editing and understanding, 4) code scalability for application to large datasets, 5) documented contingencies for code maintenance, 6) documentation to facilitate user understanding; 7) extensive tutorials, and 8) unit testing. We illustrate these principles using a new R package, {photosynthesis}, which provides a set of analytical and simulation tools for plant ecophysiology. Our goal with these principles is to advance scientific discovery in plant ecophysiology by making it easier to use code for simulation and data analysis, reproduce results, and rapidly incorporate new biological understanding and analytical tools.",

Classical Trk signalling concepts fail to explain ligand-independent signalling of intracellular TrkB or NTRK fusion proteins. Here, we show that abundance of the intracellular domain of TrkB is sufficient for ligand-independent autophosphorylation. This constitutive TrkB signalling reduced actin filopodia dynamics, could phosphorylate FAK, and changed cell morphology. Mutating Y705 in the kinase domain of TrkB alone specifically blocked these pathways. Engineered intracellular kinase domain proteins and a cancer-related intracellular NTRK2-fusion protein (SQSTM1-NTRK2) also underwent constitutive activation. In migrating glioblastoma-like U87MG cells, self-active TrkB kinase reduced cell migration. Moreover, we found evidences for constitutively active, intracellular TrkB in tissue of human grade IV glioblastoma. Structural modelling of the kinase domain let us postulate that  release from cis-autoinhibition by abundance is sufficient for TrkB/FAK/Actin signalling via Y705. These constitutive signalling pathways could be fully blocked within minutes by clinically approved, anti-tumorigenic Trk inhibitors. In conclusion, our data provide an explanation and biological function for TrkB kinase domain signalling in the absence of a ligand.",

    "abstract": "The remarkable ability of Agrobacterium tumefaciens to transfer DNA to plant cells has allowed the generation of important transgenic crops. One challenge of A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation is eliminating the bacteria after plant transformation to prevent detrimental effects to plants and the release of engineered bacteria to the environment. Here we use a reverse genetics approach to identify genes involved in ampicillin resistance with the goal of utilizing these antibiotic-sensitive strains for plant transformations. We show that treating A. tumefaciens C58 with ampicillin led to increased {beta}-lactamase production, a response dependent on the broad-spectrum {beta}-lactamase AmpC and its transcription factor AmpR. Loss of the putative ampD orthologue, atu2113, led to constitutive production of AmpC-dependent {beta}-lactamase activity and ampicillin resistance. Finally, one cell wall remodeling enzyme, MltB3, was necessary for the AmpC-dependent {beta}-lactamase activity and its loss elicited ampicillin and carbenicillin sensitivity in the A. tumefaciens C58 and GV3101 strains. Furthermore, GV3101{Delta} mltB3 transforms plants with comparable efficiency to wildtype but can be cleared with sub-lethal concentrations of ampicillin. The functional characterization of the genes involved in the inducible ampicillin resistance pathway of A. tumefaciens constitutes a major step forward in efforts to reduce the intrinsic antibiotic resistance of this bacterium.\n\nIMPORTANCEAgrobacterium tumefaciens, a significant biotechnological tool for production of transgenic plant lines, is highly resistant to a wide variety of antibiotics, posing challenges for various applications. One challenge is the efficient elimination of A. tumefaciens from transformed plant tissue without using levels of antibiotics that are toxic to the plants. Here, we present the functional characterization of genes involved in {beta}-lactam resistance in A. tumefaciens. Knowledge about proteins that promote or inhibit {beta}-lactam resistance will enable the development of strains to improve the efficiency of Agrobacterium-mediated plant genetic transformations. Effective removal of Agrobacterium from transformed plant tissue has the potential to maximize crop yield and food production, improving the outlook for global food security.",

    "abstract": "Defective autophagy is associated with chronic inflammation. Loss-of-function of the core autophagy gene Atg16l1 increases risk for Crohns disease by enhancing innate immunity in macrophages. However, autophagy also mediates clearance of intracellular pathogens. These divergent observations prompted a re-evaluation of ATG16L1 in antimicrobial immunity. In this study, we found that loss of Atg16l1 in macrophages enhanced the killing of virulent Shigella flexneri (S.flexneri), an enteric bacterium that resides within the cytosol by escaping all membrane-bound compartments. Quantitative multiplexed proteomics revealed that ATG16L1 deficiency significantly upregulated proteins involved in the glutathione-mediated antioxidant response to compensate for elevated oxidative stress, which also promoted S.flexneri killing. Consistently, myeloid cell-specific deletion of Atg16l1 accelerated bacterial clearance in vivo. Finally, pharmacological modulation of oxidative stress by suppression of cysteine import conferred enhanced microbicidal properties to wild type macrophages. These findings demonstrate that control of oxidative stress by ATG16L1 regulates antimicrobial immunity against intracellular pathogens.\n\nImpact statementMaculins et al utilize multiplexed mass spectrometry to show that loss of the autophagy gene Atg16l1 in macrophages enhances antimicrobial immunity against intracellular pathogens via the oxidative stress response.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in POLG, encoding POL{gamma}A, the catalytic subunit of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase, cause a spectrum of disorders characterized by mtDNA instability. However, the molecular pathogenesis of POLG-related diseases is poorly understood and efficient treatments are missing. Here, we generated a POLGA449T/A449T mouse model, which reproduces the most common human recessive mutation of POLG, encoding the A467T change, and dissected the mechanisms underlying pathogenicity. We show that the A449T mutation impairs DNA binding and mtDNA synthesis activities of POL{gamma} in vivo and in vitro. Interestingly, the A467T mutation also strongly impairs interactions with POL{gamma}B, the homodimeric accessory subunit of holo-POL{gamma}. This allows the free POL{gamma}A to become a substrate for LONP1 protease degradation, leading to dramatically reduced levels of POL{gamma}A, which in turn exacerbates the molecular phenotypes of PolgA449T/A449T mice. Importantly, we validated this mechanism for other mutations affecting the interaction between the two POL{gamma} subunits. We suggest that LONP1 dependent degradation of POL{gamma}A can be exploited as a target for the development of future therapies.",

    "abstract": "We report the interaction of resveratrol with an octamer DNA sequence d(CCAATTGG)2, present in the promoter region of many oncogenes, using a combination of absorption, fluorescence, calorimetric and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques to probe the binding. Resveratrol binds to the duplex sequence with a binding constant 2.20x106 M-1 in absorption studies. A ligandduplex stoichiometry of 2.2:1 was obtained with binding constant varying from 109 to 106M-1 with the concentration of DNA varied in fluorescence titration measurements. Spectral changes indicated external binding of resveratrol to duplex DNA. Circular dichroism data displayed minimal variation suggesting external binding. Melting temperatures of DNA and its 1:1 complex showed a difference of approximately 2.25{degrees}C, which supports the external binding. Nuclear magnetic resonance data showed resveratrol binds to the minor groove region near the AT basepair from the nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopic cross peaks. Distance restrained molecular dynamics was employed in explicit solvent condition to obtain the lowest energy structure. The complex was stable and retained the B-DNA conformation. Findings in this study identify resveratrol as a minor groove binder to the AT region of DNA and pave the way for exploring resveratrol and its analogues as promising anticancer/antibacterial drug.",

    "abstract": "Translational recoding, also known as ribosomal frameshifting, is a process that causes ribosome slippage along the messenger RNA, thereby changing the amino acid sequence of the synthesized protein. Whether the chloroplast employs recoding, is unknown. I-iota, a plastome mutant of Oenothera (evening primrose), carries a single adenine insertion in an oligoA stretch of atpB (encoding a {beta}-subunit of the ATP synthase). The mutation is expected to cause synthesis of a truncated, non-functional protein. We report that a full-length AtpB protein is detectable in I-iota leaves, suggesting operation of a recoding mechanism. To characterize the phenomenon, transplastomic tobacco lines were generated, in which the atpB reading frame was altered by insertions or deletions in the oligoA motif. We found that insertion of two adenines was more efficiently compensated than insertion of a single adenine, or deletion of one or two adenines. We further show that homopolymeric composition of the oligoA stretch is essential for recoding. Plants carrying a disrupted oligoA stretch have an albino-phenotype, indicating absence of indel correction. Our work provides evidence for the operation of translational recoding in chloroplasts. Recoding enables correction of frameshift mutations and can restore photoautotrophic growth in mutants that otherwise would be lethal.",

One of these enzymes, Zdhhc5, has previously been shown to regulate synapse plasticity. Here, we report that Zdhhc5 is also essential for the formation of excitatory, but not inhibitory synapses both in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate in vitro that this is dependent on Zdhhc5s enzymatic activity, its localization at the plasma membrane, and its C-terminal domain which has been shown to be truncated in a patient with schizophrenia. Loss of Zdhhc5 in mice results in a decrease in the density of excitatory hippocampal synapses accompanied by alterations in membrane capacitance and synaptic currents, consistent with an overall decrease in spine number and silent synapses. These findings reveal an important role for Zdhhc5 in the formation and/or maintenance of excitatory synapses.",

Reddy recently anticipated the implication of circadian rhythm in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is the causative agent of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). In addition to its key role in the regulation of biological functions, the circadian rhythm has been suggested as a regulator of viral infections. Specifically, the time of day of infection was found critical for illness progression, as has been reported for influenza, respiratory syncytial and parainfluenza type 3 viruses. We analyzed circadian rhythm implication in SARS-CoV-2 virus infection of isolated human monocytes, key actor cells in Covid-19 disease, from healthy subjects. The circadian gene expression of Bmal1 and Clock genes was investigated with q-RTPCR. Monocytes were infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus strain and viral infection was investigated by One-Step qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence. Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1{beta} and IL-10 levels were also measured in supernatants of infected monocytes. Using Cosinor analysis, we showed that Bmal1 and Clock transcripts exhibited circadian rhythm in monocytes with an acrophase and a bathyphase at Zeitgeber Time (ZT)6 and ZT17. After forty-eight hours, the amount of SARS-CoV-2 virus increased in the monocyte infected at ZT6 compared to ZT17. The high virus amount at ZT6 was associated with significant increased release in IL-6, IL-1{beta} and IL-10 compared to ZT17. Our results suggest that time day of SARS-CoV-2 infection affects viral infection and host immune response. They support consideration of circadian rhythm in SARS-CoV-2 disease progression and we propose circadian rhythm as a novel target for managing viral progression.\n\nImportanceThe implication of circadian rhythm (CR) in pathogenesis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been recently anticipated.

    "abstract": "BackgroundStigma associated with tobacco smoking, especially during pregnancy, may lead to underreporting and possible bias in studies relying on self-reported smoking data. Cotinine, a nicotine metabolite with a [~]20h half-life in blood, is often used as a biomarker of smoking. The objective of this study was to examine the concordance between self-reported smoking and plasma cotinine concentration among participants enrolled in two related cohorts of vulnerable individuals: human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive and HIV-negative pregnant women enrolled in the CARMA-PREG cohort and HIV-positive and HIV-negative non-pregnant women and men enrolled in the CARMA-CORE cohort.\n\nMethodsFor HIV-positive (n=76) and negative (n=24) pregnant women, plasma cotinine was measured by ELISA in specimens collected during the third trimester, between 28 and 38 weeks of gestation. Plasma cotinine was also measured in HIV-positive (n=43) and negative (n=57) women and men enrolled in the CARMA-CORE cohort.\n\nResultsSelf-reported smokers were more likely to have low income (p<0.001) in both cohorts, and to deliver preterm (p=0.007) in CARMA-PREG. In the CARMA-PREG cohort, concordance between plasma cotinine was 95% for self-reported smoking, and 89% for self-reported non-smoking. In the CARMA-CORE cohort we observed similarly high concordances of 96% and 92% for self-reported smoking and non-smoking, respectively. In this sample, the odds of discordance between self-reported smoking status and cotinine levels were not significantly different between self-reported smokers and non-smokers, nor between pregnant women and others. Taken together, the overall concordance between plasma cotinine and self-reported data was 94% with a Cohens kappa coefficient of 0.860 among all participants.\n\nConclusionsGiven the high proportion of vulnerable people in the CARMA-PREG and CARMA-CORE cohorts, our results may not be fully generalizable to the general population. However, they demonstrate that participant surveying in a non-judgemental context can lead to accurate and robust self-report data.\n\nImplicationsReliable self-reported smoking data is necessary to account for smoking status in subsequent studies. Our results suggest that future studies should ensure that study participants feel sale to speak candidly to non-judgemental research staff to obtain reliable self-report data.",

    "abstract": "Emerging clinical data demonstrates that COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV2, is a syndrome that variably affects nearly every organ system. Indeed, the clinical heterogeneity of COVID-19 ranges from relatively asymptomatic to severe disease with death resultant from multiple constellations of organ failures. In addition to genetics and host characteristics, it is likely that viral dissemination is a key determinant of disease manifestation. Given the complexity of disease expression, one major limitation in current animal models is the ability to capture this clinical heterogeneity due to technical limitations related to murinizing SARS-CoV2 or humanizing mice to render susceptible to infection. Here we describe a murine model of COVID-19 using respiratory infection with the native mouse betacoronavirus MHV-A59. We find that whereas high viral inoculums uniformly led to hypoxemic respiratory failure and death, lethal dose 50% (LD50) inoculums led to a recapitulation of most hallmark clinical features of COVID-19, including lymphocytopenias, heart and liver damage, and autonomic dysfunction. We find that extrapulmonary manifestations are due to viral metastasis and identify a critical role for type-I but not type-III interferons in preventing systemic viral dissemination. Early, but not late treatment with intrapulmonary type-I interferon, as well as convalescent serum, provided significant protection from lethality by limiting viral dissemination. We thus establish a Biosafety Level II model that may be a useful addition to the current pre-clinical animal models of COVID-19 for understanding disease pathogenesis and facilitating therapeutic development for human translation.",

Unregulated cytokine storm together with impaired immunometabolic response leads to highest mortality in elderly infected with SARS-CoV-2. To investigate how aging compromises defense against COVID-19, we developed a model of natural murine beta coronavirus (mCoV) infection with mouse hepatitis virus strain MHV-A59 (mCoV-A59) that recapitulated majority of clinical hallmarks of COVID-19. Aged mCoV-A59-infected mice have increased mortality and higher systemic inflammation in the heart, adipose tissue and hypothalamus, including neutrophilia and loss of {gamma}{delta} T cells in lungs. Ketogenic diet increases beta-hydroxybutyrate, expands tissue protective {gamma}{delta} T cells, deactivates the inflammasome and decreases pathogenic monocytes in lungs of infected aged mice. These data underscore the value of mCoV-A59 model to test mechanism and establishes harnessing of the ketogenic immunometabolic checkpoint as a potential treatment against COVID-19 in the elderly.\n\nHighlights - Natural MHV-A59 mouse coronavirus infection mimics COVID-19 in elderly.\n- Aged infected mice have systemic inflammation and inflammasome activation\n- Murine beta coronavirus (mCoV) infection results in loss of pulmonary {gamma}{delta} T cells.\n- Ketones protect aged mice from infection by reducing inflammation.\n\n\neTOC BlurbElderly have the greatest risk of death from COVID-19.

Filtering pipelines including antigenicity, and also physiochemical properties of designed vaccine were then evaluated by different immunoinformatics tools. Finally, vaccine-structure modeling and immune simulation of the desired vaccine were performed aiming to create robust T cell immune responses. We anticipate that our design based on the T cell antigen epitopes and the frame of the immunoinformatics analysis could serve as valuable supports for the development of COVID-19 vaccine.",

    "abstract": "One third of COVID-19 patients develop significant neurological symptoms, yet SARS-CoV-2 is rarely detected in central nervous system (CNS) tissue, suggesting a potential role for parainfectious processes, including neuroimmune responses. We therefore examined immune parameters in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood samples from a cohort of patients with COVID-19 and significant neurological complications. We found divergent immunological responses in the CNS compartment, including increased levels of IL-12 and IL-12-associated innate and adaptive immune cell activation. Moreover, we found increased proportions of B cells in the CSF relative to the periphery and evidence of clonal expansion of CSF B cells, suggesting a divergent intrathecal humoral response to SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, all COVID-19 cases examined had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the CSF whose target epitopes diverged from serum antibodies. We directly examined whether CSF resident antibodies target self-antigens and found a significant burden of CNS autoimmunity, with the CSF from most patients recognizing neural self-antigens. Finally, we produced a panel of monoclonal antibodies from patients CSF and show that these target both anti-viral and anti-neural antigens--including one mAb specific for the spike protein that also recognizes neural tissue. This exploratory immune survey reveals evidence of a compartmentalized and self-reactive immune response in the CNS meriting a more systematic evaluation of neurologically impaired COVID-19 patients.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA subset of COVID-19 patients with neurologic impairment show cerebrospinal fluid-specific immune alterations that point to both neuroinvasion and anti-neural autoimmunity as potential causes of impairment.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly become a global public health threat due to the lack of effective drugs or vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. The efficacy of several repurposed drugs has been evaluated in clinical trials. Among these drugs, a relatively new antiandrogen agent, enzalutamide, was proposed because it reduces the expression of transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), a key component mediating SARS-CoV-2-driven entry into host cells, in prostate cancer cells. However, definitive evidence for the therapeutic efficacy of enzalutamide in COVID-19 is lacking. Here, we evaluated the antiviral efficacy of enzalutamide in prostate cancer cells, lung cancer cells, human lung organoids and SARS-CoV-2-infected Ad-ACE2-transduced Tmprss2 knockout (Tmprss2-KO) and wild-type (WT) mice. TMPRSS2 knockout significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Enzalutamide effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in human prostate cancer cells (LNCaP) but not in human lung cancer cells or patient-derived lung organoids. Although Tmprss2 knockout effectively blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection in ACE2-transduced mice, enzalutamide showed no antiviral activity due to the AR independence of TMPRSS2 expression in mouse and human lung epithelial cells. Moreover, we observed distinct AR binding patterns between prostate cells and lung cells and a lack of direct binding of AR to TMPRSS2 in human lung cells. Thus, our findings do not support the postulated protective role of enzalutamide in treating COVID-19.",

To facilitate antiviral screening against SARS-CoV-2 without requirement for high biosafety level facility, we developed a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-vectored replicon of SARS-CoV-2, nCoV-SH01 strain, in which secreted Gaussia luciferase (sGluc) was encoded in viral subgenomic mRNA as a reporter gene. The replicon was devoid of structural genes spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E). Upon transfection, the replicon RNA replicated in various cell lines, and was sensitive to interferon alpha (IFN-), remdesivir, but was resistant to hepatitis C virus inhibitors daclatasvir and sofosbuvir. Replication of the replicon was also sensitive overexpression of zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP). We also constructed a four-plasmid in-vitro ligation system that is compatible with the BAC system, which makes it easy to introduce desired mutations into the assembly plasmids for in-vitro ligation. This replicon system would be helpful for performing antiviral screening and dissecting virus-host interactions.",

Several studies showed that the glycosylation of virus spike (S) protein and the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the host cell is critical for the virus infectivity. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were used to explore the role of a novel mutated O-glycosylation site (D494S) on the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of S protein. This site was suggested as a key mediator of virus-host interaction. We showed that the decoration of S494 with elongated O-glycans results in stabilized interactions on the direct RBD-ACE2 interface with more favorable binding free energies for longer oligosaccharides. Hence, this crucial factor must be taken into account for any further inhibitory approaches towards RBD-ACE2 interaction.",

Its channels are formed by KCNQ subunits, from which KCNQ4 is restricted to certain brainstem structures. We sought evidence for the function of the M-current in the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) and the contribution of KCNQ4 subunits to the M-current and aimed to find its functional significance in the PPN. We found that cholinergic inputs of the PPN can effectively inhibit M-current. This current is capable of synchronizing neighboring neurons and inhibition of the M-current decreases neuronal synchronization. We showed that only a subpopulation of cholinergic neurons has KCNQ4-dependent M-current. The KCNQ4 subunit expression potentially regulates the presence of other KCNQ subunits. Deletion of KCNQ4 leads to alterations in adaptation of activity to light-darkness cycles, thus representing the potential role of KCNQ4 in regulation of sleep-wakefulness cycles. The presence of this protein restricted to certain brainstem nuclei raises the possibility that it might be a potential target for selective therapeutic interventions affecting the reticular activating system.",

The Timothy syndrome mutation is a rare de novo gain-of-function variant in CACNA1C that causes autism with high penetrance, providing a powerful avenue into investigating the role of CACNA1C variants in neurodevelopmental disorders. In our previous work, we demonstrated that an egl-19(gof) mutation, that is equivalent to the Timothy syndrome mutation in the human homolog CACNA1C, can disrupt termination of the PLM axon in C. elegans. Here, we find that the egl-19(gof) mutation disrupts the polarity of process outgrowth in the ALM neuron of C. elegans. We also find that the egl-19(gof) mutation can disrupt termination of the ALM axon. These results suggest that the Timothy syndrome mutation can disrupt multiple steps of axon development. Further work exploring the molecular mechanisms that underlie these perturbations in neuronal polarity and axon termination will give us better understanding to how variants in CACNA1C contribute to the axonal defects that underlie autism.",

We have noted an accelerated extracellular vesicle mediated export of \"used\" miRNAs in mammalian cells and the miRNA-export process get retarded by Ago2 interacting protein GW182B. The GW182 group of proteins are localized to GW182 Bodies or RNA Processing Bodies in mammalian cells and GW182B dependent retardation of miRNA export depends on GW-body integrity and is independent of HuR mediated auxiliary pathway of miRNA export.

    "abstract": "Under amino acid starvation condition, eukaryotic organisms activate a general amino acid control response. In Neurospora crassa, Cross Pathway Control-1 (CPC-1), the ortholog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae bZIP transcription factor GCN4, functions as the master regulator of the general amino acid control response. Codon usage biases are a universal feature of eukaryotic genomes and are critical for regulation of gene expression. Although codon usage has also been implicated in the regulation of protein structure and function, genetic evidence supporting this conclusion is very limited. Here we show that Neurospora cpc-1 has a non-optimal NNU-rich codon usage profile that contrasts with the strong NNC codon preference in the genome. Although substitution of the cpc-1 NNU codons with synonymous NNC codons elevated CPC-1 expression in Neurospora, it altered CPC-1 degradation rate and abolished its amino acid starvation-induced protein stabilization. The codon-manipulated CPC-1 protein also exhibited different sensitivity to limited protease digestion. Furthermore, CPC-1 functions in rescuing the cell growth of the cpc-1 deletion mutant and activating the expression of its target genes were impaired by the synonymous codon changes. Together, these results reveal the critical role of codon usage in regulating of CPC-1 expression and function, and establish a genetic example of the importance of codon usage in protein structure.\n\nAbstract importanceGeneral amino acid control response is critical for organisms to adapt to amino acid starvation condition. The preference to use certain synonymous codons are a universal feature of all genomes. Synonymous codon changes were previously thought to be silent mutations. In this study, we show that the Neurospora cpc-1 gene has an unusual codon usage profile compared to other genes in the genome. We found that codon optimization of the cpc-1 gene without changing its amino acid sequence resulted in elevated CPC-1 expression, altered protein degradation rate and impaired protein functions due to changes in protein structure. Together, these results reveal the critical role of synonymous codon usage in regulating of CPC-1 expression and function, and establish a genetic example of the importance of codon usage in protein structure.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe larvacean Oikopleura dioica is an abundant tunicate plankton with the smallest (65-70 Mbp) non-parasitic, non-extremophile animal genome identified to date. Currently, there are two genomes available for the Bergen (OdB3) and Osaka (OSKA2016) O. dioica laboratory strains. Both assemblies have full genome coverage and high sequence accuracy. However, a chromosome-scale assembly has not yet been achieved.\n\nResultsHere, we present a chromosome-scale genome assembly (OKI2018_I69) of the Okinawan O. dioica produced using long-read Nanopore and short-read Illumina sequencing data from a single male, combined with Hi-C chromosomal conformation capture data for scaffolding. The OKI2018_I69 assembly has a total length of 64.3 Mbp distributed among 19 scaffolds. 99% of the assembly is in five megabase-scale scaffolds. We found telomeres on both ends of the two largest scaffolds, which represent assemblies of two fully contiguous autosomal chromosomes. Each of the other three large scaffolds have telomeres at one end only and we propose that they correspond to sex chromosomes split into a pseudo-autosomal region and X-specific or Y-specific regions. Indeed, these five scaffolds mostly correspond to equivalent linkage groups of OdB3, suggesting overall agreement in chromosomal organization between the two populations. At a more detailed level, the OKI2018_I69 assembly possesses similar genomic features in gene content and repetitive elements reported for OdB3. The Hi-C map suggests few reciprocal interactions between chromosome arms. At the sequence level, multiple genomic features such as GC content and repetitive elements are distributed differently along the short and long arms of the same chromosome.\n\nConclusionsWe show that a hybrid approach of integrating multiple sequencing technologies with chromosome conformation information results in an accurate de novo chromosome-scale assembly of O. dioicas highly polymorphic genome. This assembly will be a useful resource for genome-wide comparative studies between O. dioica and other species, as well as studies of chromosomal evolution in this lineage.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia risk is associated with increased gene copy number and brain expression of complement component 4 (C4). Because the complement system facilitates synaptic pruning, the C4 association has renewed interest in a hypothesis that excessive pruning contributes to schizophrenia pathogenesis. However, little is known about complement regulation in neural tissues or whether such regulation could be relevant to psychiatric illness. Intriguingly, common variation within CSMD1, which encodes a putative complement inhibitor, has consistently associated with schizophrenia at genome-wide significance. We found that Csmd1 is predominantly expressed in the brain by neurons, and is enriched at synapses; that human stem cell-derived neurons lacking CSMD1 are more vulnerable to complement deposition; and that mice lacking Csmd1 have increased brain complement activity, fewer synapses, aberrant complement-dependent development of a neural circuit, and synaptic elements that are preferentially engulfed by cultured microglia. These data suggest that CSMD1 opposes the complement cascade in neural tissues.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=168 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/291427v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (30K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@172c857org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bee84corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@184da10org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10867c8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphic Abstract.Our findings support a model in which CSMD1 opposes actions of the complement cascade in neural tissues (top left). We investigated two models in which Csmd1 was genetically ablated: human cortical neurons derived from embryonic stem cells, and a back-crossed C57bl6-Tac mouse line (top right). Csmd1 is normally expressed by neurons and present at synapses where it can protect them from complement (bottom left); in the absence of Csmd1 (bottom right), we find more deposition of complement (on cultured human cortical neurons and in the mouse visual system), reduced numbers of synapses (in the mouse visual system), and synaptic fractions that are more readily engulfed by microglia (ex vivo).

    "abstract": "Trypanosoma cruzi is an intracellular parasite that causes Chagas disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Many cellular and molecular aspects of this neglected disease are not fully understood. Prior studies have shown that galectin-1 (Gal-1), a {beta}-galactoside-binding protein that regulates leukocyte recruitment to the inflammatory site, and promotes T. cruzi infection, but the mechanism is unclear. Here, we report that C57BL/6 mice lacking Gal-1 (Lgals1-/-) exhibited lower parasitemia and higher survival rates than their wildtype (WT) counterparts when infected with T. cruzi Y strain. Two weeks after infection, Lgals1-/- mice displayed greater neutrophil accumulation in infection site and heart tissue than WT mice. In T. cruzi-infected Lgals1-/- mice, infiltrated neutrophils produced increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), while macrophages and neutrophils produced increased levels of nitric oxide (NO), which reduced replication and viability of parasites in vitro and downregulated IL-1{beta} production. Pharmacological inhibition of NADPH oxidase and NO synthase during early in vivo infection reversed the protective effect of Gal-1 deficiency in Lgals1-/- mice. Together, our findings demonstrate that lacking Gal-1 favors neutrophil migration to the infection site and increases production of ROS and NO, thereby controlling the early steps of T. cruzi infection by reducing parasitemia and prolonging survival of infected mice.",

    "abstract": "Receptor activator of NF-{kappa}B ligand (RANKL) is essential for osteoclast formation and bone remodeling. Nevertheless, the cellular source of RANKL for osteoclastogenesis has not been fully uncovered. Different from peripheral adipose tissue, bone marrow (BM) adipose lineage cells originate from bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells(BMSCs). Here we demonstrate that adiponectin promoter-driven Cre expression (AdipoqCre) can target bone marrow adipose lineage cells. We cross the AdipoqCre mice with ranklfl/fl mice to conditionally delete RANKL from BM adipose lineage cells. Conditional deletion of RANKL increases cancellous bone mass of long bones in mice by reducing the formation of trabecular osteoclasts and inhibiting bone resorption but does not affect cortical bone thickness or resorption of calcified cartilage. AdipoqCre; ranklfl/fl mice exhibit resistance to estrogen deficiency and rosiglitazone (ROS) induced trabecular bone loss but show bone loss induced by unloading. BM adipose lineage cells therefore represent an essential source of RANKL for the formation of trabecula osteoclasts and resorption of cancellous bone during remodeling under physiological and pathological conditions. Targeting bone marrow adiposity is a promising way of preventing pathological bone loss.",

Here, we studied the assembly of hundreds of soil-derived microbial communities on a wide range of well-defined resource environments, from single carbon sources to combinations of up to 16. We found that, while single resources supported multispecies communities varying from 8 to 40 taxa, mean community richness increased only one-by-one with additional resources. Cross-feeding could reconcile these seemingly contrasting observations, with the metabolic network seeded by the supplied resources explaining the changes in richness due to both the identity and the number of resources, as well as the distribution of taxa across different communities. By using a consumer-resource model incorporating the inferred cross-feeding network, we provide further theoretical support to our observations and a framework to link the type and number of environmental resources to microbial community diversity.",

In this study, we examine whether tetracycline-resistant mutants are less fit in the absence of the drug than their sensitive parents, and whether the fitness cost of resistance is constant or variable across independently derived lines. Tetracycline-resistant lines suffered, on average, a reduction in fitness of almost 8%. There was substantial among-line variation in the fitness cost. This variation was not associated with the level of phenotypic resistance conferred by the mutations, nor did it vary significantly across several different genetic backgrounds. The two resistant lines with the most extreme fitness costs involved functionally unrelated mutations on different genetic backgrounds. However, there was also significant variation in the fitness costs for mutations affecting the same pathway and even different alleles of the same gene. Our findings demonstrate that the fitness costs of antibiotic resistance do not always correlate with the phenotypic level of resistance or the underlying genetic changes. Instead, these costs reflect the idiosyncratic effects of particular resistance mutations and the genetic backgrounds in which they occur.",

    "abstract": "In mammals, the placenta mediates maternal-fetal nutrient and waste exchange and provides immunomodulatory actions that facilitate maternal-fetal tolerance. The placenta is highly diversified among mammalian species, yet the molecular mechanisms that distinguish the placenta of human from other mammals are not fully understood. Using an interspecies transcriptomic comparison of human, macaque, and mouse term placentae, we identified hundreds of genes with lineage-specific expression - including dozens that are placentally-enriched and potentially related to pregnancy. We further annotated the enhancers for different human tissues using epigenomic data and demonstrate that the placenta and chorion are unique in that their enhancers display the least conservation. We identified numerous lineage-specific human placental enhancers, and found they are highly overlapped with specific families of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), including MER21A, MER4A/B and MER39B that were previously linked to immune response and placental function. Among these ERV families, we further demonstrate that MER41 insertions create dozens of lineage-specific Serum Response Factor (SRF) binding loci in human, including one adjacent to FBN2, a placenta-specific gene with increased expression in humans that produces the peptide hormone placensin to stimulate glucose secretion and trophoblast invasion. Our results demonstrate the prevalence of lineage-specific human placental enhancers which are frequently associated with ERV insertions and likely facilitated the lineage-specific evolution of the mammalian placenta.",

Free ammonia (FA, i.e. NH3-N) pretreatment has been demonstrated to be able to enhance anaerobic digestion, which is a widely used method for sludge treatment. However, the effect of combined FA pretreatment and anaerobic digestion on the fate of ARGs is still unknown. This study demonstrated for the first time that combined FA pretreatment (420 mg NH3-N/L for 24 h) and anaerobic digestion could reduce the abundances of the tested ARGs by 0.06 log10 gene copies/g TS (total solids) compared with the anaerobic digestion alone. Specifically, the experimental results showed that combined FA pretreatment and anaerobic digestion reduced the abundances of aac(6)-Ib-cr, blaTEM, sul2, tetA, tetB and tetX by 0.07, 0.37, 0.09, 0.32, 0.24 and 0.59 log10 gene copies/g TS compared with anaerobic digestion alone. In contrast, combined FA pretreatment and anaerobic digestion slightly increased the abundance of tetG by 0.05 log10 gene copies/g TS compared with anaerobic digestion alone. In addition, FA pretreatment did not significantly affect the abundance of sul1 and tetM during anaerobic digestion. This study revealed that FA pretreatment for anaerobic digestion could potentially reduce the spread of antibiotic resistance from the sludge to soil (while agriculture reuse is used as the sludge disposal method), thereby protecting the environment and human health.",

    "abstract": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a common, aggressive cancer of notorious genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity. A major challenge is predicting response to drug treatment, which has typically been done using genomic tools alone with little success. A novel method that incorporates phenotypic profiling for predicting the effectiveness of therapy for individual patients is desperately needed. BioDynamic Imaging (BDI) is a technique for measuring time-dependent fluctuations in back-scattered light through living tumor tissues to identify critical changes in intracellular dynamics that are associated with phenotypic response to drugs. In this study, BDI and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data were collected on tumor samples from dogs with naturally occurring DLBCL, an animal model of increasingly recognized relevance to the human disease. BDI and RNA-seq data were combined to identify correlations between gene co-expression modules and linear combinations of biomarkers to provide biological mechanistic interpretations of BDI biomarkers. Using regularized multivariate logistic regression, we combined RNA-seq and BDI data to develop a novel model to accurately classify the clinical response of canine DLBCL to combination chemotherapy (i.e. CHOP). Our model incorporates data on the expression of 4 genes and 3 BDI-derived phenotypic biomarkers, capturing changes in transcription, microtubule related processes, and apoptosis. This pilot study suggests that the combination of multi-scale transcriptomic and phenotypic data can identify patients that respond to a given treatment a priori in a disease that has been difficult to treat.

    "abstract": "Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are currently being tested in numerous clinical trials as potential cell therapies for the treatment of various diseases and due to their potential immunomodulatory, pro-angiogenic, and regenerative properties. However, variabilities in tissue sources, donors, and manufacturing processes and the lack of defined critical quality attributes (CQAs) and clinically relevant mechanism of action (MoA) pose significant challenges to identify MSC cell therapy products with a predictable therapeutic outcome. This also hinders regulatory considerations and broad clinical translation of MSCs. MSC products are often administered to the patient immediately after thawing from cryopreserved vials (out-of-thaw). However, the qualifying quality-control assays are either performed before cryopreservation, or after culturing the post-thaw cells for 24-48 hours (culture-rescued), none of which represent the out-of-thaw product administered to patients. In this study, we performed a broad functional characterization of out-of-thaw and culture-rescue MSCs from bone marrow (BM-MSCs) and cord tissue (CT-MSCs) using macrophage activation and T cell proliferation-based in vitro potency assays and deep phenotypic characterization using single-cell RNA-sequencing. Using this data, we developed unbiased computational models, specifically symbolic regression (SR) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) models to predict the immunomodulatory potency of MSCs. Overall, our results suggest that manufacturing conditions (OOT vs. CR) have a strong effect on MSC-function on MSC interactions with macrophages and T cells. Furthermore, single-cell RNA-seq analyses of out-of-thaw BM and CT-MSCs indicate a tissue of origin-dependent variability and heterogeneity in the transcriptome profile. Using symbolic regression modeling we identified specific single-cell transcriptomic attributes of MSCs that predict their immunomodulatory potency. In addition, CCA modeling predicted MSC donors with high or low immunomodulatory potency from their transcriptome profiles. Taken together, our results provide a broad framework for identifying predictive CQAs of MSCs that could ultimately help in better understanding of their MOAs and improved reproducibility and manufacturing control of MSCs.",

    "abstract": "The protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium is a leading cause of diarrheal disease in those with compromised or under-developed immune systems, particularly infants and toddlers in resource-poor localities. As an enteric pathogen, Cryptosporidium invades the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells, where it resides in close proximity to metabolites in the intestinal lumen. However, the effect of gut metabolites on susceptibility to Cryptosporidium infection remains largely unstudied. Here, we first identified which gut metabolites are prevalent in neonatal mice when they are most susceptible to Cryptosporidium parvum infection, and then tested the isolated effects of these metabolites on C. parvum invasion and growth. Our findings demonstrate that medium or long-chain saturated fatty acids inhibit C. parvum growth, while long-chain unsaturated fatty acids enhance C. parvum invasion. The influence of these two classes of metabolites on C. parvum infection likely reflects the streamlined metabolism in C. parvum, which is unable to synthesize fatty acids. Hence, gut metabolites, either from diet or produced by the microbiota, play an important role in the early susceptibility to cryptosporidiosis seen in young animals.\n\nImportanceCryptosporidium occupies a unique intracellular niche that exposes the parasite to both host cell contents and the intestinal lumen, including metabolites from the diet and produced by the microbiota. Both dietary and microbial products change over the course of early development, and could contribute to the changes seen in susceptibility to cryptosporidiosis in humans and mice. Consistent with this model, we show that the immature gut metabolome influenced growth of C. parvum in vitro and may increase susceptibility to infection in young mice. Interestingly, metabolites that significantly altered parasite growth were fatty acids, a class of molecules that Cryptosporidium is unable to synthesize de novo. The enhancing effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids and the inhibitory effects of saturated fatty acids provide further insight into reliance on fatty acid salvage and metabolism of this enteric parasite.",

    "abstract": "Previous study demonstrated 150 mg{middle dot}kg-1 glycerol monolaurate (GML) consumption induced gut microbiota dysbiosis and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in low-fat diet fed mice. However, little is known about the dose-effect of dietary GML modulating the gut microbiome alterations and its impacts on the induction of MetS in low-fat diet. Dietary GML-induced effects on MetS and gut microbiota alterations were investigated, combined with antibiotics-treated germ-free experiment and specific gut microbiota transplantation. Our results demonstrated that high-dose (500 mg{middle dot}kg-1) GML alleviated MetS by significantly decreasing the body weight, weight gain, food intake, fat droplet size and percentage of abdominal fat, serum triglycerides (TG), LDL, LPS, TNF- and atherogenic index, compared to the medium-dose (150 mg{middle dot}kg-1) GML. Importantly, high-dose GML significantly increased Lactobacillus reuteri compared to the medium-dose GML. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed Lactobacillus reuteri was positively associated with the metabolic improvement of high-dose GML. Notably, antibiotics-treated germ-free experiment and Lactobacillus reuteri transplantation demonstrated that altered gut microbiota was necessary and sufficient for GML-induced distinct effects on metabolic syndrome. Our results indicate that GML impacts gut microbiome inducing distinct effects on metabolic syndrome, thereby calling for reassessing the safe dosage of GML and other non-specific antibacterial food additives.\n\nIMPORTANCEGrowing evidence indicate that the broad use of food emulsifying agents may lead to increase the societal incidence of obesity/ MetS and other chronic inflammatory diseases. GML is widely and regularly consumed as a generally safe food emulsifier and as a potent antimicrobial agent in commonly foods such as meat products, cereals and soft beverage by the general public. Our results indicate that GML impacts gut microbiome inducing distinct effects on metabolic syndrome. Our study provides important and timely evidence supporting the emerging concept that non-specific antibacterial food additives have two-sided effect on gut microbiota contributing to the uncertainties for the incidence of obesity/metabolic syndrome and other chronic inflammatory diseases.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveWhite adipose tissue (WAT) expansion regulates energy balance and overall metabolic homeostasis. WAT absence or loss occurring through lipodystrophy and lipoatrophy contributes to the development of dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance. We previously demonstrated the sole small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) E2-conjuguating enzyme Ubc9 represses human adipocyte differentiation. Germline and other tissue-specific deletions of Ubc9 frequently cause lethality in mice. As a result, the role of Ubc9 during WAT development remains unknown.\n\nMethodsTo determine how Ubc9 impacts body composition and energy balance, we generated adipocyte-specific Ubc9 knockout mice (Ubc9a-KO). CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing inserted loxP sites flanking exons 3 and 4 at the Ubc9 locus. Subsequent genetic crosses to AdipoQ-Cre transgenic mice allowed deletion of Ubc9 in white and brown adipocytes. We measured multiple metabolic endpoints that describe energy balance and carbohydrate metabolism in Ubc9a-KO and littermate controls during postnatal growth.\n\nResultsTo our surprise, Ubc9a-KO mice developed hyperinsulinemia and hepatic steatosis. Global energy balance defects emerged from dysfunctional WAT marked by pronounced local inflammation, loss of serum adipokines, hepatomegaly, and near absence of major adipose tissue depots. We observed progressive lipoatrophy that commences in the early adolescent period.\n\nConclusionsOur results demonstrate that Ubc9 expression in mature adipocytes is essential for maintaining WAT expansion. Deletion of Ubc9 in fat cells compromised and diminished adipocyte function that provoked WAT inflammation and ectopic lipid accumulation in the liver. Our findings reveal an indispensable role for Ubc9 during white adipocyte expansion and endocrine control of energy balance.",

    "abstract": "Human pluripotent stem cells hold significant promise for regenerative medicine. However, long differentiation protocols and immature characteristics of stem cell-derived cell types remain challenges to the development of many therapeutic applications. In contrast to the slow differentiation of human stem cells in vitro that mirrors a nine-month gestation period, mouse stem cells develop according to a much faster three-week gestation timeline. Here, we tested if co-differentiation with mouse pluripotent stem cells could accelerate the differentiation speed of human embryonic stem cells. Following a six-week RNA-sequencing time course of neural differentiation, we identified 929 human genes that were upregulated earlier and 535 genes that exhibited earlier peaked expression profiles in chimeric cell cultures than in human cell cultures alone. Genes with accelerated upregulation were significantly enriched in Gene Ontology terms associated with neurogenesis, neuron differentiation and maturation, and synapse signaling. Moreover, chimeric mixed samples correlated with in utero human embryonic samples earlier than human cells alone, and acceleration was dose-dependent on human-mouse co-culture ratios. Differences in the timing and expression levels of genes corresponding to neuron cell types and brain region identity under chimeric conditions were also observed. The altered developmental rates and lineage outcomes described in this report have implications for accelerating human stem cell differentiation and the use of interspecies chimeric embryos in developing human organs for transplantation.\n\nAuthor SummaryHuman pluripotent stem cells often require long in vitro protocols to form mature cell types of clinical relevance for potential regenerative therapies, a ramification of a nine-month developmental clock in utero that also runs ex utero. What controls species-specific developmental time and whether the timer is amenable to acceleration is unknown. Further, interspecies chimeric embryos are increasingly being created to study early human development or explore the potential growth of human organs for transplantation. How the conflicting developmental speeds of cells from different species co-differentiating together affect each other is not understood. Here, using genome-wide transcriptional analysis of RNA-sequencing time courses, we show that 1) co-differentiating human embryonic stem cells intermixed with mouse stem cells accelerated elements of human developmental programs, 2) the acceleration was dose-dependent on the proportion of mouse cells, and 3) human cells in chimeric samples correlated to in utero samples earlier than human only samples. Our results provide evidence that some components of species-specific developmental clocks may be susceptible to acceleration.",

Here, we studied the origin and maintenance of symbionts of Drosophila larvae under ecologically realistic conditions, to our knowledge for the first time, using yeast and bacterial isolates and two Drosophila species: the model organism D. melanogaster and the invasive pest D. suzukii. We discovered that Drosophila females and males both transmit yeast and bacteria symbionts to larvae. In addition, several symbiotic yeasts initially associated with larvae were conserved throughout host life cycle and transmitted to offspring. Our results suggest that stable associations of Drosophila flies with bacteria and yeasts may exist in natura and constitute a step forward in the understanding of wild Drosophila-microorganism symbioses.",

To address this gap in knowledge we performed multiregional whole genome sequencing and clonal analysis to elucidate the evolutionary dynamics of non-coding regions in pancreatic cancer relative to those of the coding genome. We find that the mutational burden of noncoding DNA is higher than coding DNA. However, when noncoding DNA was segregated into enhancer and non-enhancer regions, enhancers were more similar to coding DNA. Mutational signatures of noncoding and coding DNA further revealed the similar mutational spectra of enhancers to coding DNA whereas the mutational spectra of non-enhancer, noncoding DNA had an entirely different pattern. These findings shed light on the role of noncoding DNA in pancreatic cancer.",

    "abstract": "PurposeTo determine the normal ocular biometric and perform advanced retinal imaging and functional assessment of a non-human primate used commonly in scientific research, the rhesus macaque.\n\nMethodsWe performed ocular phenotyping on rhesus macaques at the California National Primate Research Center. This consisted of anterior and posterior segment eye examination by ophthalmologists, advanced retinal imaging, and functional retinal electrophysiology.\n\nResultsFull eye exams were performed on 142 animals consisting of pupillary light reflex, tonometry, external exam and photography, anterior slit lamp examination, and posterior segment examination by indirect ophthalmoscopy. Ages of the rhesus macaques ranged from 0.7 to 29 years (mean=16.4 years, stdev=7.5 years). Anterior segment measurements such as intraocular pressure (n=142), corneal thickness (n=84), lens thickness (n=114), and axial length (n=114) were acquired. Advanced retinal imaging in the form of fundus photography (n=78), optical coherence tomography (n=60), and quantitative autofluorescence (n=44) were obtained. Electroretinography (n=75) was used to assay retinal function. Quantitative analyses of macular structure, retinal layer segmentation, and rod and cone photoreceptor electrical responses are reported. Quantitative assessments were made and variations between genders and age groups were analyzed to compare with established sex and age-related changes in human eyes.\n\nConclusionsThe rhesus macaque has ocular structure and function very similar to that of the human eye. Age-related ocular changes between rhesus and humans are similar. In particular, macular structure and function are very similar to humans making this species particularly useful for the study of macular biology and development of therapies for inherited and age-related macular degenerations as well as cone photoreceptor disorders.",

    "abstract": "Dendritic spines are enriched with stable and dynamic actin filaments, which determine their structure and shape. Disruption of the Abl2/Arg nonreceptor tyrosine kinase in mice compromises spine stability and size. We provide evidence that binding to cortactin tethers Abl2 in spines, where Abl2 and cortactin maintain the small pool of stable actin required for dendritic spine stability. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of GFP-actin, we find that disruption of Abl2:cortactin interactions eliminates stable actin filaments in dendritic spines, significantly reducing spine density. A subset of spines remaining after Abl2 depletion retain their stable actin pool and undergo activity-dependent spine enlargement associated with increased cortactin levels. Finally, tonic increases in synaptic activity rescue spine loss upon Abl2 depletion by promoting cortactin enrichment in vulnerable spines. Together, our findings strongly suggest Abl2:cortactin interactions promote spine stability by maintaining pools of stable actin filaments in spines.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation characterizes multiple neurologic diseases, including primary inflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and classical neurodegenerative diseases. Aberrant activation of the innate immune system contributes to disease progression in these conditions, but drugs that modulate innate immunity, particularly within the central nervous system (CNS), are lacking. The CNS-pene-trant natural product bryostatin-1 (bryo-1) attenuates neuroinflammation by targeting innate myeloid cells. Supplies of natural bryo-1 are limited but a recent scalable synthesis has enabled access to it and its analogs (termed bryologs), the latter providing a path to more efficacious, better tolerated, and more accessible agents. Here, we show that multiple synthetically accessible bryologs replicate the anti-inflammatory effects of bryo-1 on innate immune cells in vitro, and a lead bryolog attenuates neuroinflammation in vivo - actions mechanistically dependent on PKC binding. Our findings identify bryologs as promising drug candidates for targeting innate immunity in neuroinflammation and create a platform for evaluation of synthetic PKC modulators in neuroinflammatory diseases such as MS.\n\nGraphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "Bacterial cells utilize monitoring substrates, which undergo force-sensitive translation elongation arrest, to feedback-regulate a Sec-related gene. Vibrio alginolyticus VemP controls the expression of SecD/F that stimulates a late step of translocation by undergoing export-regulated elongation arrest. Here, we attempted at delineating the pathway of the VemP nascent-chain interaction with Sec-related factors, and identified the signal recognition particle (SRP) and PpiD (a membrane-anchored periplasmic chaperone) in addition to other translocon components and a ribosomal protein as interacting partners. Our results showed that SRP is required for the membrane-targeting of VemP, whereas PpiD acts cooperatively with SecD/F in the VemP arrest-cancelation. We also identified the conserved Arg-85 residue in VemP as an essential element for the regulated arrest-cancelation of VemP. We propose a scheme of the arrest-cancelation processes of VemP, which likely monitors late steps in the protein translocation pathway.",
