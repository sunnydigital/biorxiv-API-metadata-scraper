    "abstract": "Allopolyploidization, which involves hybridization and genome doubling, is a key driving force in higher plant evolution. The transcriptome reprogramming that accompanies allopolyploidization can cause extensive phenotypic variations, and thus confers allopolyploids higher evolutionary potential than their diploid progenitors. Despite many studies, little is known about the interplay between hybridization and genome doubling in transcriptome reprogramming during allopolyploidization. Here, we performed genome-wide analyses of gene expression and splicing changes during allopolyploidization in wheat and brassica lineages. Our results indicated that both hybridization and genome doubling can induce genome-wide transcriptional and splicing changes. Notably, the gene transcriptional and splicing changes caused by hybridization can be largely recovered to parental levels by genome doubling in allopolyploids. Since transcriptome reprogramming is an important contributor to heterosis, our results revealed that only part of the heterosis in hybrids can be fixed in allopolyploids through genome doubling. Therefore, our findings update the current understanding of the permanent fixation of heterosis in hybrids through genome doubling. In addition, our results indicated that a large proportion of the transcriptome reprogramming in interspecific hybrids was not caused by the merging of two parental genomes, providing novel insights into the mechanism of heterosis.",

    "abstract": "To identify the microbial markers from the complex human gut microbiome for delineating the disease-related microbial alteration is of great interest. Here, we develop a framework combining neural network (NN) and random forest (RF), resulting in 40 marker species and 90 marker genes identified from the metagenomic dataset D1 (185 healthy and 183 type 2 diabetes (T2D) samples), respectively. Using these markers, the NN model obtains higher accuracy in classifying the T2D-related samples than machine learning-based approaches. The NN-based regression analysis determines the fasting blood glucose (FBG) is the most significant association factor (P<<0.05) in the T2D-related alteration of the gut microbiome. Twenty-four marker species that vary little across the case and control samples and are often neglected by the statistic-based methods greatly shift in different stages of the T2D development, implying that the cumulative effect of the markers rather than individuals likely drives the alteration of the gut microbiome.",

    "abstract": "PurposeBreast cancer diagnosed within 10 years following childbirth is defined as postpartum breast cancer (PPBC) and is highly metastatic. Interactions between immune cells and other stromal cells within the involuting mammary gland are fundamental in facilitating an aggressive tumor phenotype. The MNK1/2-eIF4E axis promotes the translation of pro-metastatic mRNAs in tumor cells, but its role in modulating the function of non-tumor cells in the PPBC microenvironment, and in particular its activity in human PPBC, has not been explored.\n\nExperimental designWe used a combination of in vivo PPBC models and in vitro assays to study the effects of phospho-eIF4E deficiency on the pro-tumor function of select cells of the TME. Furthermore, we employed Imaging Mass Cytometry on PPBC and non-PPBC patient samples, to chart the expression of the MNK1/2-eIF4E axis components in the TME.\n\nResultsHere, we show that phospho-eIF4E deficient (eIF4ES209A) PPBC mice are protected against lung metastasis and reveal differences in the lung immune microenvironment of the WT and eIF4ES209A mice. Moreover, we show that the expression of fibroblast-derived IL-33, an alarmin known to induce invasion, was repressed upon MNK1/2-eIF4E axis inhibition. Imaging Mass Cytometry results indicated that human PPBC contain phospho-eIF4E high-expressing tumor cells and CD8+ T cells displaying an activated dysfunctional phenotype. Finally, we block lung metastasis in PPBC mice, using combined MNK1/2 inhibition and anti-PD-1 therapy.\n\nConclusionsThese findings implicate the involvement of the MNK1/2-eIF4E axis during PPBC metastasis and suggest a promising immunomodulatory route to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy by blocking phospho-eIF4E.\n\nTranslational relevancePostpartum breast cancer (PPBC) is highly aggressive. It is hypothesized that involution-induced changes in the postpartum breast microenvironment, which include an influx of inflammatory immune cells and activation of resident fibroblasts, facilitate the invasiveness of an existing neoplasm. We used imaging mass cytometry to do an in-depth profiling of the MNK1-eIF4E axis in the TME of a unique cohort of PPBC and non-PPBC patients. We observed patterns of phospho-eIF4E in non-tumor cells that were specific to the TME of PPBC. We also noted that the CD8+ T cells present in PPBC express an activated dysfunctional phenotype characterized by the co-expression of HLA-DR and PD-1. This study represents a first look at the expression of the MNK1-eIF4E axis in the stromal cells of metastatic breast cancer and has therapeutic implications as we show, in an animal model of PPBC, that MNK1/2 inhibition can be used to sensitize tumors to anti-PD1 immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) is a vascular sarcoma that metastasizes early and lacks an effective medical therapy. The TAZ-CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3 fusion proteins are chimeric transcription factors and initiating oncogenic drivers of EHE. A combined proteomic/genetic screen identified YEATS2 and ZZZ3, components of the Ada2a-containing histone acetyltransferase (ATAC) complex, as key interactors of both TAZ-CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3 despite the dissimilarity of the C terminal fusion partners CAMTA1 and TFE3. An integrative next generation sequencing approach showed the fusion proteins drive expression of a unique transcriptome distinct from TAZ and YAP by simultaneously hyperactivating a TEAD-based transcriptional program and modulating the chromatin environment via interaction with the ATAC complex. Interaction of the ATAC complex with both TAZ-CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3 indicates the histone acetyltransferase complex is an oncogenic driver in EHE and potentially other sarcomas. Furthermore, the ATAC complex is an enzymatic transcriptional cofactor required for both fusion proteins in EHE, representing a unifying therapeutic target for this sarcoma. Gene fusions are the most common genetic alterations activating TAZ and YAP in cancer, and this study serves as a template for identifying epigenetic modifiers recruited by the C terminal fusion partners of other TAZ/YAP gene fusions occurring in gliomas, carcinomas, and other sarcomas.\n\nSummaryTAZ-CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3 alter the TAZ/YAP transcriptional program by recruiting the ATAC complex and modifying the chromatin landscape.",

    "abstract": "Because the risk of thromboembolism increases with age, as well as due to infectious diseases, safer and more effective thrombolytic agents are in greater demand. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is currently used clinically because it has higher binding specificity for insoluble fibrin (IF) than urokinase (UK), but even pro-tPA has catalytic activity in places other than IF. Meanwhile, UK has the advantage that it is specifically activated on IF, but it only binds IF weakly. Unlike the anti-IF monoclonal antibody (mAb) established in the past, our anti-IF mAb recognizes a pit structure formed only in IF. Here, we developed a new mAb against the pit, 1101, that does not affect coagulation or fibrinolysis, and prepared a fusion protein of UK with humanized 1101 Fab to transport UK selectively to IF. In IF-containing lesions, UK is cleaved by plasmin at two sites, Lys158/Ile159 and Lys135/Lys136. Cleavage of the former leads to activation of UK; however, because activated UK is linked by S-S bonds before and after cleavage, it is not released from the fusion. Cleavage at the latter site causes UK to leave the fusion protein; hence, we mutated Lys135/Lys136 to Gly135/Gly136 to prevent release of UK. This engineered UK-antibody fusion, AMU1114, significantly decreased the systemic side effects of UK in vivo. In a mouse thrombus formation experiment, the vascular patency rate was 0% (0/10) in the control, 50% (5/10) in the tPA, and 90% (9/10) in the AMU1114 treatment group. These data support future clinical development of AMU1114.",

    "abstract": "Leaves are asymmetric, with differential functionalization of abaxial and adaxial tissues. The bundle sheath (BS) surrounding the vasculature of the C3 crop barley is dorsoventrally differentiated into three domains: adaxial structural, lateral S-type, and abaxial L-type. S-type cells seem to transfer assimilates towards the phloem. Here we used single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate BS differentiation in C4 maize. Abaxial BS (abBS) cells of rank-2 intermediate veins specifically expressed three SWEET sucrose uniporters (SWEET13a, b, and c) and UmamiT amino acid efflux transporters. SWEET13a, b, c were also identified in the phloem parenchyma (PP). Thus maize acquired a unique mechanism for phloem loading in which abBS cells provide the main pathway for apoplasmic sucrose transfer towards the phloem. This pathway predominates in veins responsible for phloem loading (rank-2 intermediate), while rank-1 intermediate and major veins export sucrose from the phloem parenchyma (PP) adjacent to the sieve element companion cell (SE/CC) complex, as in Arabidopsis. We surmise that abBS identity is subject to dorsoventral patterning and has components of PP identity. These observations provide first insights into the unique transport-specific properties of abBS cells and support for a modification to the canonical phloem loading pathway of maize, which may be generalizable to other C4 monocots.",

The generalization capacity of the SVM model was evaluated by applying the original model through an Out-Of-Sample Cross Validation analysis (OOCV) to unseen SCZ patients from an independent sample that underwent 50 hours of ABCT.\n\nResultsThe whole-brain GM volume-based pattern classification predicted  higher vs.  lower functioning at follow-up with a balanced accuracy (BAC) of 69.4% (sensitivity 72.2%, specificity 66.7%) as determined by nested cross-validation. The neuroanatomical model was generalizable to an independent cohort with a BAC of 62.1% (sensitivity 90.9%, specificity 33.3%).\n\nConclusionsIn particular, greater baseline GM volume in regions within superior temporal gyrus, thalamus, anterior cingulate and cerebellum -- predicted improved functioning at the single-subject level following ABCT in SCZ participants.",

    "abstract": "Stimulation of cells by type I interferons (IFN) leads to the differential expression of 100s of genes known as interferon stimulated genes, ISGs. The collection of ISGs differentially expressed under IFN stimulation, referred to as the IFN signature, varies across cell types. Non-canonical IFN signaling has been clearly associated with variation in IFN signature across cell types, but the existence of variation in canonical signaling and its impact on IFN signatures is less clear. The canonical IFN signaling pathway involves binding of the transcription factor ISGF3 to IFN-stimulated response elements, ISREs. We examined ISRE binding patterns under IFN stimulation across six cell types using existing ChIPseq datasets available on the GEO and ENCODE databases. We find that ISRE binding is cell specific, particularly for ISREs distal to transcription start sites, potentially associated with enhancer elements, while ISRE binding in promoter regions is more conserved. Given variation of ISRE binding across cell types, we investigated associations between the cell type, homeostatic state and ISRE binding patterns. Taking a machine learning approach and using existing ATACseq and ChIPseq datasets available on GEO and ENCODE, we show that the epigenetic state of an ISRE locus at homeostasis and the DNA sequence of the ISRE locus are predictive of the ISREs binding under IFN stimulation in a cell type, specific manner, particularly for ISRE distal to transcription start sites.",

    "abstract": "Carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii are prevalent in low- and middle-income countries such as Egypt, but little is known about the molecular epidemiology and mechanisms of resistance in these settings. Here we characterise carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii from Alexandria, Egypt, and place it in a regional context. 54 carbapenem-resistant isolates from Alexandria Main University Hospital, Egypt, collected between 2010 and 2015 were genome sequenced using Illumina technology. Genomes were de novo assembled and annotated. Genomes for 36 isolates from the Middle East region were downloaded from GenBank. Core gene compliment was determined using Roary, and analyses of recombination were performed in Gubbins. MLST sequence type and antibiotic resistance genes were identified. The majority of Egyptian isolates belonged to one of 3 major clades, corresponding to Pasteur MLST clonal complex (CCPAS) 1, CCPAS2 and sequence type (STPAS) 158. Strains belonging to STPAS158 have been reported almost exclusively from North Africa, the Middle East and Pakistan, and may represent a region-specific lineage. All isolates carried an oxa23 gene, six carried blaNDM-1, and one carried blaNDM-2. The oxa23 gene was located on a variety of different mobile elements, with Tn2006 predominant in CCPAS2 strains, and Tn2008 predominant in other lineages. Of particular concern, in 8 of the 11 CCPAS1 strains, the carbapenemase gene was located in a temperate bacteriophage phiOXA, previously identified only once before in a CCPAS1 clone from the US military. The carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii population in Alexandria Main University hospital is very diverse, and indicates an endemic circulating population, including a region-specific lineage. The major mechanism for oxa23 dissemination in CCPAS1 isolates appears to be a bacteriophage, presenting new concerns about the ability of these carbapenemases to spread throughout the bacterial population.\n\nData SummaryThe whole genome shotgun sequences of the isolates from this study have been deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the BioProject accession number PRJNA659545.

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae is a commensal of the human nasopharynx and a major cause of respiratory and invasive disease. Pneumococcus stimulates upper respiratory tract inflammation that promotes shedding from mucosal surfaces and transmission to new hosts. Colonisation and transmission are partially antagonistic processes. Adhesion to surfaces and evasion of host responses favours the former, whilst detachment, promoted by inflammation, is necessary for the latter. We sought to determine how adaptation and evolution of pneumococcus within its nasopharyngeal niche might progress when selective pressures associated with transmission were removed. This was achieved by serial passage of pneumococci in mouse models of nasopharyngeal carriage, manually transferring bacteria between mice. To assess the role of host environmental factors on pneumococcal evolution, we also performed analogous experimental evolution in a mouse pneumonia model, passaging pneumococci through lungs. Nasopharynx-passaged pneumococci became more effective colonisers, whilst those evolved within lungs showed reduced virulence. We observed selection of mutations in genes associated with cell wall biogenesis and metabolism in both nasopharynx and lung lineages, but identified prominent examples of parallel evolution that were niche specific. We focussed on gpsA, a gene in which the same single nucleotide polymorphism arose in two independently evolved nasopharynx-passaged lineages. We identified a single nucleotide change conferring resistance to oxidative stress and enhanced nasopharyngeal colonisation potential. We show that gpsA is also a frequent target of mutation during human colonisation. These findings highlight the role played by the host environment in determining trajectories of bacterial evolution and the potential of experimental evolution in animal infection models for identification of novel pathogen virulence and colonisation factors.",

    "abstract": "Dengue is endemic in tropical and subtropical countries and is transmitted mainly by Aedes aegypti. Mosquito movement can be affected by human-made structures such as roads that can act as a barrier. Roads can influence the population genetic structure of Ae. aegypti. We investigated the genetic structure and gene flow of Ae. aegypti as influenced by a primary road, Espana Boulevard (EB) with 2000-meter-long stretch and 24-meters-wide in a very fine spatial scale. We hypothesized that Ae. aegypti populations separated by EB will be different due to the limited gene flow as caused by the barrier effect of the road. A total of 376 adults and larval Ae. aegypti were collected from June to September 2017 in 21 sites across EB. North (N1-N11) and South (S1-S10) comprised of 211 and 165 individuals, respectively. All mosquitoes were genotyped at 11 microsatellite loci. AMOVA FST indicated significant genetic differentiation across the road. The constructed UPGMA dendrogram found 4 genetic groups revealing the clear separation between North and South sites across the road. On the other hand, Bayesian cluster analysis showed four genetic clusters (K = 4) wherein each individual samples have no distinct genetic cluster thus genetic admixture. Moreover, significant positive spatial autocorrelation was observed at 100 - 200 m distance class, suggesting dispersal potential of the adult mosquitoes within a 200 m spatial scale. Our results suggest that human-made landscape features such as primary roads are potential barriers to mosquito movement thereby limiting its gene flow across the road. This information is valuable in designing an effective mosquito control program in a very fine spatial scale.\n\nAuthor SummaryDengue, a mosquito-borne viral infection is a serious health problem in tropical and subtropical countries such as Philippines. Most dengue prevention programs aim to eradicate its mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti. A successful population control program is reliant in understanding the mosquito behavior and ecology including how human-made structures such as roads influence its expansion and movement. Previous studies have discovered the barrier effect of roads in the movement of mosquitoes. In this study, we examined the influence of roads in the population genetic structure of Ae. aegypti in a fine spatial scale using 11 microsatellite markers. We found significant genetic differentiation of mosquito populations across the road. Our results suggest limited gene flow across the road and supports our hypothesis that roads are potential barriers to mosquito dispersal. This information can be used in designing an effective mosquito population control zones in perceived barrier to mosquito dispersal such as roads.",

    "abstract": "The complete assembly of each human chromosome is essential for understanding human biology and evolution. Using complementary long-read sequencing technologies, we complete the first linear assembly of a human autosome, chromosome 8. Our assembly resolves the sequence of five previously long-standing gaps, including a 2.08 Mbp centromeric -satellite array, a 644 kbp defensin copy number polymorphism important for disease risk, and an 863 kbp variable number tandem repeat at chromosome 8q21.2 that can function as a neocentromere. We show that the centromeric -satellite array is generally methylated except for a 73 kbp hypomethylated region of diverse higher-order -satellite enriched with CENP-A nucleosomes, consistent with the location of the kinetochore. Using a dual long-read sequencing approach, we complete the assembly of the orthologous chromosome 8 centromeric regions in chimpanzee, orangutan, and macaque for the first time to reconstruct its evolutionary history. Comparative and phylogenetic analyses show that the higher-order -satellite structure evolved specifically in the great ape ancestor, and the centromeric region evolved with a layered symmetry, with more ancient higher-order repeats located at the periphery adjacent to monomeric -satellites. We estimate that the mutation rate of centromeric satellite DNA is accelerated at least 2.2-fold, and this acceleration extends beyond the higher-order -satellite into the flanking sequence.",

We present the model, test the sensitivity and robustness of its parameters, and calibrate it with clinical data from exercise oncology experiments which offer a natural biological backdrop for modulation of anti-tumor immune response. We then perform two virtual experiments with the model that demonstrate its usefulness in guiding pre-clinical and clinical studies of immunotherapy. The first virtual experiment describes the intricate dynamics in the tumor microenvironment between the tumor and the infiltrating immune cells. Such dynamics is difficult to probe during a pre-clinical study as it requires significant redundancy in lab animals and is prohibitively time-consuming and labor-intensive. The result is a series of spatiotemporal snapshots of the tumor and its microenvironment that can serve as a platform to test mechanistic hypotheses on the role and dynamics of different immune cells in anti-tumor immune response. The second virtual experiment shows how dosage and/or frequency of immunotherapy drugs can be optimized based on the aerobic fitness of the patient, so that possible adverse side effects of the treatment can be minimized.",

    "abstract": "Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease which kills an estimated 50000 people each year, with its deadly impact confined mainly to lower to middle income countries. Leishmania parasites are transmitted to human hosts by sand fly vectors during blood feeding. Recent experimental work shows that transmission is modulated by the patchy landscape of infection in the hosts skin, and the parasite population dynamics within the vector. Here we assimilate these new findings into a simple probabilistic model for disease transmission which replicates recent experimental results, and assesses their relative importance. The results of subsequent simulations, describing random parasite uptake and dynamics across multiple blood meals, show that skin heterogeneity is important for transmission by short-lived flies, but that for longer-lived flies with multiple bites the population dynamics within the vector dominate transmission probability. Our results indicate that efforts to reduce fly lifespan beneath a threshold of around two weeks may be especially helpful in reducing disease transmission.",

    "abstract": "Developing spinal motor networks produce a diverse array of outputs, including episodic and continuous patterns of rhythmic activity. Variation in excitability state and neuromodulatory tone can facilitate transitions between episodic and continuous rhythms; however, the intrinsic mechanisms that govern these rhythms and their transitions are poorly understood. Here, we tested the capacity of a single central pattern generator (CPG) circuit with tunable properties to generate multiple outputs. To address this, we deployed a computational model composed of an inhibitory half-centre oscillator (HCO). Following predictions of our computational model, we tested the contributions of key properties to the generation of an episodic rhythm produced by isolated spinal cords of the newborn mouse. The model recapitulates the diverse state-dependent rhythms evoked by dopamine. In the model, episodic bursting depended predominantly on the endogenous oscillatory properties of neurons, with Na+/K+ ATPase pump (IPump) and hyperpolarization-activated currents (Ih) playing key roles. Modulation of either IPumpMax or Ih produced transitions between episodic and continuous rhythms and silence. As IPump increased, the episode duration and period increased along with a reduction in interepisode interval. Increasing Ih increased the episode period along with an increase in episode duration. Pharmacological manipulations of Ih with ZD7288 and IPump with ouabain or monensin in isolated spinal cords produced findings consistent with the model. Our modelling and experimental results highlight key roles of Ih and IPump in producing episodic rhythms and provide insight into mechanisms that permit a single CPG to produce multiple patterns of rhythmicity.\n\nSignificance statementThe ability of a single CPG to produce and transition between multiple rhythmic patterns of activity is poorly understood. We deployed a complementary computational half-centre oscillator model and an isolated spinal cord experimental preparation to identify key currents whose interaction produced episodic and continuous rhythmic activity. Together, our experimental and modelling approaches suggest mechanisms in spinal networks that govern diverse rhythms and transitions between them. This work sheds light on the ability of a single CPG to produce episodic bouts observed in behavioural and pathological contexts.",

    "abstract": "The corticospinal tract is unique to mammals and the corpus callosum is unique to placental mammals (eutherians). The emergence of these structures is thought to underpin the evolutionary acquisition of complex motor and cognitive skills. Corticospinal motor neurons (CSMN) and callosal projection neurons (CPN) are the archetypal projection neurons of the corticospinal tract and corpus callosum, respectively. Although a number of conserved transcriptional regulators of CSMN and CPN development have been identified in vertebrates, none are unique to mammals and most are co-expressed across multiple projection neuron subtypes. Here, we discover seventeen CSMN-enriched microRNAs (miRNAs), fifteen of which map to a single genomic cluster that is exclusive to eutherians. One of these, miR-409-3p, promotes CSMN subtype identity in part via repression of LMO4, a key transcriptional regulator of CPN development. In vivo, miR-409-3p is sufficient to convert deep-layer CPN into CSMN. This is the first demonstration of an evolutionarily acquired miRNA in eutherians that refines cortical projection neuron subtype development. Our findings implicate miRNAs in the eutherians increase in neuronal subtype and projection diversity, the anatomic underpinnings of their complex behavior.\n\nSignificance StatementThe mammalian central nervous system contains unique projections from the cerebral cortex thought to underpin complex motor and cognitive skills, including the corticospinal tract and corpus callosum. The neurons giving rise to these projections - corticospinal and callosal projection neurons - develop from the same progenitors, but acquire strikingly different fates. The broad evolutionary conservation of known genes controlling cortical projection neuron fates raises the question of how the more narrowly conserved corticospinal and callosal projections evolved. We identify a microRNA cluster selectively expressed by corticospinal projection neurons and exclusive to placental mammals. One of these microRNAs promotes corticospinal fate via regulation of the callosal gene LMO4, suggesting a mechanism whereby microRNA regulation during development promotes evolution of neuronal diversity.",

We confirmed the identity of the mDA neurons using single-cell RNA-sequencing and detection of classical markers. Single-cell live imaging demonstrated neuronal calcium signalling and functional dopamine transport. Electrophysiology measures highlighted the ability to form synapses and networks in culture. Patient-specific hiPSC lines differentiated to produce functional mDA neurons that exhibit the hallmarks of synucleinopathy including: aggregate formation, oxidative stress as well as mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired lysosomal dynamics.

We developed a connectome- and biophysically-based model for distributed working memory that incorporates multiple neuron types and a dopamine gradient. The model captures an inverted U-shaped dependence of working memory on dopamine. The spatial distribution of mnemonic persistent activity matches that observed in over 90 experimental studies. We show that dopamine filters out irrelevant stimuli by enhancing inhibition of pyramidal cell dendrites. The level of cortical dopamine can also determine whether memory encoding is through persistent activity or an internal synaptic state. Taken together, our work represents a cross-level understanding that links molecules, cell types, recurrent circuit dynamics and a core cognitive function distributed across the cortex.",

    "abstract": "Sequential behaviour is often compositional and organised across multiple time scales: a set of individual elements developing on short time scales (motifs) are combined to form longer functional sequences (syntax). Such organisation leads to a natural hierarchy that can be used advantageously for learning, since the motifs and the syntax can be acquired independently. Despite mounting experimental evidence for hierarchical structures in neuroscience, models for temporal learning based on neuronal networks have mostly focused on serial methods. Here, we introduce a network model of spiking neurons with a hierarchical organisation aimed at sequence learning on multiple time scales. Using biophysically motivated neuron dynamics and local plasticity rules, the model can learn motifs and syntax independently. Furthermore, the model can relearn sequences efficiently and store multiple sequences. Compared to serial learning, the hierarchical model displays faster learning, more flexible relearning, increased capacity, and higher robustness to perturbations. The hierarchical model redistributes the variability: it achieves high motif fidelity at the cost of higher variability in the between-motif timings.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies demonstrate that the production of words is delayed when speakers process in temporal proximity semantically related words. Yet the experimental settings underlying this effect are different from those under which we typically speak. This study demonstrates that semantic interference disappears, and can even turn into facilitation, when semantically related words are embedded in a meaningful communicative exchange.

Semantic interference reappeared with identical experimental parameters in a single-person picture-word interference setting (Experiment 2, N=32).

    "abstract": "TGF-{beta} family ligands are key regulators of dendritic cell (DC) differentiation and activation. Epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs) require TGF- {beta} family signaling for their differentiation and canonical TGF-{beta}1 signaling secures a non-activated LC state. LCs reportedly control skin inflammation and are replenished from peripheral blood monocytes, which also give rise to pro-inflammatory monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs). Among all the miRNAs differentially expressed in LC vs moDCs, we observed miR-424 to be strongly induced during moDC differentiation from monocytes. We discovered that miR-424 is required for moDC differentiation from human and murine precursor cells in vitro and for inflammation-associated moDC in vivo. Mechanistically we found that low levels of miR-424 facilitate TGF-{beta}1-dependent LC differentiation at the expense of moDC differentiation. Loss of miR-424 in monocyte/DC precursors resulted in the induction of TGF-{beta} pathway. Therefore, miR-424 plays a decisive role in anti-inflammatory LC vs pro-inflammatory moDC differentiation from monocytes, and its repression allows TGF-{beta} ligands to promote LC differentiation.\n\nShort summaryMonocytes give rise to two distinct DC subsets in skin inflammation, exhibiting opposite roles in inflammation. This study identified miR-424(322) as a molecular switch controlling pro-inflammatory (moDC) vs anti-inflammatory LC subset differentiation by modulating TGF-{beta} signaling.",

Adipose tissue inflammation regulates the thermogenic stress response but how adipose tissue-resident cells instigate thermogenic failure in aged are unknown. Here, we define alterations in the adipose-resident immune system and identify that type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) are lost in aging. Restoration of ILC2 numbers in aged mice to levels seen in adults through IL-33 supplementation failed to rescue old mice from metabolic impairment and cold-induced lethality.

CUE in soil microbes is often measured through respiration-based studies, especially through the addition of a labile carbon substrate such as glucose. Therefore, exploring the response of microbial respiration to availability of labile substrates is crucial to understand microbial CUE in soils. In this work, we build upon a cellular model of the Warburg effect, where cells simultaneously utilize inefficient aerobic glycolysis/fermentation and efficient oxidative phosphorylation pathways for energy synthesis even at high oxygen availability, to predict microbial community response to various levels of substrate availability. We test our predictions systematically using a series of substrate-induced respiration (SIR) experiments to demonstrate prevalence of the Warburg effect in soil microbial communities.

    "abstract": "Abstract.Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a medically important alphaherpesvirus that induces fusion of the virion envelope and the cell membrane during entry, and between cells to form polykaryocytes within infected tissues during pathogenesis. All members of the Herpesviridae, including VZV, have a conserved core fusion complex composed of glycoproteins, gB, gH and gL. The ectodomain of the primary fusogen, gB, has five domains, DI-V, of which DI contains the fusion loops needed for fusion function. We recently demonstrated that DIV is critical for fusion initiation, which was revealed by a 2.8[A] structure of a VZV neutralizing mAb, 93k, bound to gB and mutagenesis of the gB-93k interface. To further assess the mechanism of mAb 93k neutralization, the binding site of a non-neutralizing mAb to gB, SG2, was compared to mAb 93k using single particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The gB-SG2 interface partially overlapped with that of gB-93k but, unlike mAb 93k, mAb SG2 did not interact with the gB N-terminus, suggesting a potential role for the gB N-terminus in membrane fusion. The gB ectodomain structure in the absence of antibody was defined at near atomic resolution by single particle cryo-EM (3.9[A]) of native full-length gB purified from infected cells and by X-ray crystallography (2.4[A]) of the transiently expressed ectodomain. Both structures revealed that the VZV gB N-terminus (aa72-114) was flexible based on the absence of visible structures in the cryo-EM or X-ray crystallography data but the presence of gB N-terminal peptides were confirmed by mass spectrometry. Notably, N-terminal residues 109KSQD112 were predicted to form a small -helix and alanine substitution of these residues abolished cell-cell fusion in a virus-free assay. Importantly, transferring the 109AAAA112 mutation into the VZV genome significantly impaired viral propagation. These data establish a functional role for the gB N-terminus in membrane fusion broadly relevant to the Herpesviridae.\n\nAuthor SummaryHerpesviruses are ubiquitous infectious agents of medical and economic importance, including varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which causes chicken pox and shingles. A unifying theme of herpesviruses is their mechanism of entry into host cells, membrane fusion, via a core complex of virally expressed envelope glycoproteins gB, gH and gL. Of these, the primary fusogen, gB, is activated by the heterodimer gH-gL through an unknown mechanism and enables the virus envelope to merge with cell membranes to release the DNA containing capsid into the cytoplasm to initiate infection. By using a human antibody that neutralizes VZV we have recently demonstrated that the initiation of membrane fusion is associated with the crown region of gB. Here, we use cryogenic electron microscopy to compare the structure of this human neutralizing antibody, 93k, to a non-neutralizing antibody SG2. Surprisingly, both antibodies bind to the crown of gB with considerable overlap of their footprints on gB with one important exception, SG2 does not bind to a flexible region in the gB N-terminus. Mutations incorporated into this flexible region disrupts gB mediated membrane fusion and significantly impairs VZV propagation, identifying an Achilles heel in viral replication.",

    "abstract": "A key regulatory process during Drosophila development is the localized suppression of the hunchback mRNA translation at the posterior, which gives rise to a hunchback gradient governing the formation of the anterior-posterior body axis. The suppression of the RNA is achieved by a concerted action of Brain Tumour (Brat), Pumilio (Pum) and Nanos. Each protein is necessary for proper Drosophila development. The RNA contacts have been elucidated for the proteins individually in several atomic-resolution structures. However, the interplay of all three proteins in the RNA suppression remains a long-standing open question. We characterize the quaternary complex of the RNA-binding domains of Brat, Pum and Nanos with hunchback mRNA by combining NMR spectroscopy, SANS/SAXS, XL/MS with MD simulations and ITC assays. The quaternary hunchback mRNA suppression complex is flexible with the unoccupied nucleotides of the RNA functioning as a flexible linker between the Brat and Pum-Nanos moieties of the complex. Moreover, Brat and Pum with Nanos bind the RNA completely independently. In accordance with previous studies, showing that Brat can suppress hunchback mRNA independently and is distributed uniformly throughout the embryo, this suggests that hunchback mRNA suppression by Brat is functionally separate from the suppression by Pumilio and Nanos.",

    "abstract": "Alternative spicing is an integral part of gene expression in multicellular organisms that allows for diverse mRNA transcripts and proteins to be produced from a single gene. However, most existing analyses have focused on macro-evolution, with only limited research on splice site evolution over shorter term, micro-evolutionary time scales. Here we examine splicing evolution that has occurred during domestication and observe 45 novel splice forms with strongly transgressive isoform compositions, representing 0.24% of analyzed transcripts. We identify loci associated with variation in the levels of these splice forms, finding that many novel transcripts were regulated by multiple alleles with non-additive interactions. A subset of these interactions involved the expression of individual spliceosome components. These overdominant and epistatic interactions often resulted in alteration in the protein-coding regions of the transcripts, resulting in frameshifts and truncations. By associating the splice variation in these genes with size and growth rate measurements, we found that none of the individual splice variants affected these plant traits significantly, but the cumulative expression of all aberrant transcripts did show a significant reduction in growth rate associated with higher proportions of disrupted transcripts. This demonstrates the importance of co-evolution of the different spliceosomal components and their regulators and suggests that these genes may contribute to evolution of reproductive isolation as Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility loci.\n\nAuthor summaryIn multicellular organisms, it is common that segments of pre-mRNA molecules are physically removed, and the remaining segments are spliced back together. Through splicing alternative combinations of segments together, organisms produce various mRNA molecules, and thus multiple proteins, using the information encoded in a single gene. Here, we investigated the RNA of two sunflower genotypes, one wild and one domesticated, as well as the hybrid offspring resulting from a cross between the two genotypes. We found certain mRNA molecules that were spliced exclusively in the hybrids and were absent in the examined parental lines. These unique hybrid mRNAs were predicted to be consequential for the hybrids health, and thus represented a malfunction in the mechanisms that regulate splicing. These results improve our understanding of the genetic regulation of alternative splicing and how alternative splice forms evolve. Our findings may lead to further inquiries about how aberrant splicing promotes the formation of new species in nature.",

    "abstract": "One of the central problems of vertebrate evolution is understanding the relationship among the distal portions of fins and limbs. Lacking comparable morphological markers of these regions in fish and tetrapods, these relationships have remained uncertain for the past century and a half. Here we show that Gli3 functions in controlling the proliferative expansion of distal progenitors are shared among median and paired fins as well as tetrapod limbs. Mutant knockout gli3 fins in medaka (Oryzias latipes) form multiple radials and rays, in a pattern reminiscent of the polydactyly observed in Gli3 null mutant mice. In limbs, Gli3 controls both anterior-posterior patterning and cell proliferation, two processes that can be genetically uncoupled. In situ hybridization, quantification of proliferation markers, and analysis of regulatory regions reveal that in paired and median fins, gli3 plays a main role in controlling proliferation but not in patterning. Moreover, gli3 downregulation in shh mutant fins rescues fin loss in a manner similar to how Gli3-deficiency restores digits in the limbs of Shh mutant mouse embryos. We hypothesize that the Gli3/Shh pathway preceded the origin of paired appendages and was originally involved in modulating cell proliferation. Accordingly, the distal regions of median fins, paired fins, and limbs retain a deep regulatory and functional homology that predates the origin of paired appendages.",

    "abstract": "RNA is considered as an attractive target for new small molecule drugs. Designing active compounds can be facilitated by computational modeling. Most of the available tools developed for these prediction purposes, such as molecular docking or scoring functions, are parametrized for protein targets. The performance of these methods, when applied to RNA-ligand systems, is insufficient. To overcome these problems, we developed AnnapuRNA, a new knowledge-based scoring function designed to evaluate RNA-ligand complex structures, generated by any computational docking method. We also evaluated three main factors that may influence the structure prediction, i.e., starting conformer of a ligand, the docking program, and the scoring function used. We applied the AnnapuRNA method for a post-hoc study of the recently published structures of the FMN riboswitch. Software is available at https://github.com/filipspl/AnnapuRNA\n\nAuthor SummaryDrug development is a lengthy and complicated process, which requires costly experiments on a very large number of chemical compounds. The identification of chemical molecules with desired properties can be facilitated by computational methods. A number of methods were developed for computer-aided design of drugs that target protein molecules. However, recently the ribonucleic acid (RNA) emerged as an attractive target for the development of new drugs. Unfortunately, the portfolio of the computer methods that can be applied to study RNA and its interactions with small chemical molecules is very limited. This situation motivated us to develop a new computational method, with which to predict RNA-small molecule interactions. To this end, we collected the information on the statistics of interactions in experimentally determined structures of complexes formed by RNA with small molecules. We then used the statistical data to train machine learning methods aiming to distinguish between RNA-ligand interactions observed experimentally and other interactions that can be observed in theoretical analyses, but are not observed in nature. The resulting method called AnnapuRNA is superior to other similar tools and can be used to predict preferred ligands of RNA molecules and how RNA and small molecules interact with each other.",

    "abstract": "One of the fundamental tasks in analyzing next-generation sequencing data is genome database search, in which DNA sequences are compared to known reference genomes for identification or annotation. Although algorithms exist for optimal database search with perfect sensitivity and specificity, these have largely been abandoned for next-generation sequencing (NGS) data in favor of faster heuristic algorithms that sacrifice alignment quality. Virtually all DNA alignment tools that are commonly used in genomic and metagenomic database search use approximate methods that sometimes report the wrong match, and sometimes fail to find a valid match when present. Here we introduce BURST, a high-throughput DNA short-read aligner that uses several new synergistic optimizations to enable provably optimal alignment in NGS datasets. BURST finds all equally good matches in the database above a specified identity threshold and can either report all of them, pick the most likely among tied matches, or provide lowest-common-ancestor taxonomic annotation among tied matches. BURST can align, disambiguate, and assign taxonomy at a rate of 1,000,000 query sequences per minute against the RefSeq v82 representative prokaryotic genome database (5,500 microbial genomes, 19GB) at 98% identity on a 32-core computer, representing a speedup of up to 20,000-fold over current optimal gapped alignment techniques.

    "abstract": "The evolution of social behavior depends on genetic changes, yet, how genomic variation manifests itself in behavioral diversity is still largely unresolved. Chromosomal inversions can play a pivotal role in producing distinct behavioral phenotypes, in particular, when inversion genes are functionally associated with hormone synthesis and signaling. Male Ruffs exhibit alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs) with an autosomal inversion determining two alternative morphs with clear behavioral and hormonal differences to the ancestral morph. We investigated hormonal and transcriptomic differences in the pituitary and gonads. Using a GnRH challenge, we found that the ability to synthesize testosterone in inversion carriers is severely constrained, whereas the synthesis of androstenedione, a testosterone precursor, is not. Inversion morphs were able to produce a transient increase in androstenedione following the GnRH injection, supporting the view that pituitary sensitivity to GnRH is comparable to that of the ancestral morph. We then performed gene expression analyses in a second set of untreated birds and found no evidence of alterations to pituitary sensitivity, gonadotropin production or gonad sensitivity to luteinizing hormone or follicle-stimulating hormone across morphs. Inversion morphs also showed reduced progesterone receptor expression in the pituitary. Strikingly, in the gonads, inversion morphs over-expressed STAR, a gene that is located outside of the inversion and responsible for providing the cholesterol substrate required for the synthesis of sex hormones. In conclusion, our results suggest that the gonads determine morph-specific differences in hormonal regulation.",

The eigenvectors of the human connectome graph Laplacian, dubbed \"connectome harmonics\", have been shown to relate to the functionally relevant resting-state networks. Whole-brain modelling of brain activity combines structural connectivity with local dynamical models to provide insight into the large-scale functional organization of the human brain. In this study, we employ the graph Laplacian and its properties to define and implement a large class of neural activity models directly on the human connectome. These models, consisting of systems of stochastic integrodifferential equations on graphs, are dubbed graph neural fields, in analogy with the well-established continuous neural fields. We obtain analytic predictions for harmonic and temporal power spectra, as well as functional connectivity and coherence matrices, of graph neural fields, with a technique dubbed CHAOSS (shorthand for Connectome-Harmonic Analysis Of Spatiotemporal Spectra). Combining graph neural fields with appropriate observation models allows for estimating model parameters from experimental data as obtained from electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); as an example application, we study a stochastic Wilson-Cowan graph neural field model on a high-resolution connectome, and show that the model equilibrium fluctuations can reproduce the empirically observed harmonic power spectrum of BOLD fMRI data. Graph neural fields natively allow the inclusion of important features of cortical anatomy and fast computations of observable quantities for comparison with multimodal empirical data. They thus appear particularly suitable for modelling whole-brain activity at mesoscopic scales, and opening new potential avenues for connectome-graph-based investigations of structure-function relationships.\n\nAuthor summaryThe human brain can be seen as an interconnected network of many thousands neuronal \"populations\"; in turn, each population contains thousands of neurons, and each is connected both to its neighbors on the cortex, and crucially also to distant populations thanks to long-range white matter fibers. This extremely complex network, unique to each of us, is known as the \"human connectome graph\". In this work, we develop a novel approach to investigate how the neural activity that is necessary for our life and experience of the world arises from an individual human connectome graph. For the first time, we implement a mathematical model of neuronal activity directly on a high-resolution connectome graph, and show that it can reproduce the spatial patterns of activity observed in the real brain with magnetic resonance imaging. This new kind of model, made of equations implemented directly on connectome graphs, could help us better understand how brain function is shaped by computational principles and anatomy, but also how it is affected by pathology and lesions.",

However, the impact of special morphological features of the GC on antibody production is not clear. According to the latest biological experiments, we establish a spatiotemporal stochastic model to simulate the whole self-organization process of the GC. We use the mixing index of different B cells to quantitatively describe the polarization in GC. With the increase of the mixing index, the affinity of plasma cells decreases gradually, even GC might collapse. Therefore, the development of light and dark zones in GC serves to maintain effective competition among different cells and promote affinity maturation. On the other hand, by varying the GC volume, a phase transition is discovered, which determines a critical GC volume for best performance in both the stochastic and the deterministic model.

    "abstract": "SIVsmm infecting sooty mangabeys has been transmitted to humans on at least nine independent occasions, giving rise to HIV-2 groups A to I. SIVsmm isolates replicate in human T cells and seem capable of overcoming major human restriction factors without adaptation. However, only groups A and B are responsible for the HIV-2 epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa and it is largely unclear whether adaptive changes were associated with significant spread in humans. To address this, we examined the sensitivity of infectious molecular clones (IMCs) of five HIV-2 strains (4 group A and one AB recombinant) and representatives of five different SIVsmm lineages to inhibition by type I interferon (IFN) and various APOBEC3 proteins. We confirmed that SIVsmm strains replicate in primary human CD4+ T cells. However, SIVsmm replication was highly variable, typically lower relative to HIV-2 isolates and almost entirely prevented by type I IFN treatment. Viral propagation was generally dependent on intact vif genes, highlighting the need for efficient counteraction of APOBEC3 proteins. On average, SIVsmm strains were significantly more susceptible to inhibition by human APOBEC3D, F, G and H than HIV-2 IMCs. For example, human APOBEC3F reduced infectious virus yield of SIVsmm by [~]80% but achieved only [~]40% in the case of HIV-2. Functional and mutational analyses of human, sooty mangabey and rhesus macaque derived alleles revealed that an R128T polymorphism in APOBEC3F is important for species-specific counteraction by HIV-2 and SIVsmm Vif proteins. In addition, we found that changes of Y45H and T84S in SIVsmm Vif increase its ability to antagonize human APOBEC3F. Altogether, our results show that SIVsmm Vifs show some intrinsic activity against human ABOBEC3 proteins, but HIV-2 Vifs acquired adaptive changes to efficiently clear this barrier in the human host.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYSIVs infecting African monkey species do not infect humans, with one notable exception. SIVsmm from sooty mangabeys managed to cross the species barrier to humans on at least nine independent occasions. This is because SIVsmm strains seem capable of overcoming many innate defense mechanisms without adaptation and that their Vif proteins are active against human APOBEC3 proteins. Here, we show that replication of SIVsmm is highly variable in human CD4 T cells and more sensitive to interferon inhibition compared to HIV-2. While different lineages of SIVsmm were capable of counteracting human APOBEC3 proteins in a Vif-dependent manner, they were significantly more susceptible to inhibition by APOBEC3D/F/G/H compared to HIV-2. Mutational analyses revealed an R128T substitution in APOBEC3F and a T84S change in Vif are relevant for species-specific counteraction by HIV-2 and SIVsmm. Altogether, our results support that HIV-2 group A adapted to humans prior to or during epidemic spread.",

To reconcile these findings, we analyzed epidermal leading edge actin networks during Drosophila embryo dorsal closure. Here, Steppke is required for F-actin of the actomyosin cable and for actin-based protrusions. steppke mutant defects in the leading edge actin networks are associated with improper sealing of the dorsal midline, but are distinguishable from effects of myosin mis-regulation. Steppke localizes to leading edge cell-cell junctions with accumulations of the F-actin regulator Enabled emanating from either side. Enabled requires Steppke for full leading edge recruitment, and genetic interaction shows the proteins cooperate for dorsal closure. Steppke over-expression induces ectopic, actin-rich, lamellar cell protrusions, an effect dependent on the Arf-GEF activity and PH domain of Steppke, but independent of Steppke recruitment to myosin-rich AJs via its coiled-coil domain. Thus, Steppke promotes actin polymerization and cell protrusions, effects that occur in conjunction with Steppkes previously reported regulation of myosin contractility during dorsal closure.",

    "abstract": "Inferences about past processes of adaptation and speciation require a gene-scale and genome-wide understanding of the evolutionary history of diverging taxa. In this study, we use genome-wide capture of nuclear gene sequences, plus skimming of organellar sequences, to investigate the phylogenomics of monkeyflowers in Mimulus section Erythranthe (27 accessions from seven species). Taxa within Erythranthe, particularly the parapatric and putatively sister species M. lewisii (bee-pollinated) and M. cardinalis (hummingbird-pollinated), have been a model system for investigating the ecological genetics of speciation and adaptation for over five decades. Across >8000 nuclear loci, multiple methods resolve a predominant species tree in which M. cardinalis groups with other hummingbird-pollinated taxa (37% of gene trees), rather than being sister to M. lewisii (32% of gene trees). We independently corroborate a single evolution of hummingbird pollination syndrome in Erythranthe by demonstrating functional redundancy in genetic complementation tests of floral traits in hybrids; together, these analyses overturn a textbook case of pollination-syndrome convergence. Strong asymmetries in allele-sharing (Pattersons D-statistic and related tests) indicate that gene-tree discordance reflects ancient and recent introgression rather than incomplete lineage sorting. Consistent with abundant introgression blurring the history of divergence, low-recombination and adaptation-associated regions support the new species tree, while high-recombination regions generate phylogenetic evidence for sister status for M. lewisii and M. cardinalis. Population-level sampling of core taxa also revealed two instances of chloroplast capture, with Sierran M. lewisii and Southern Californian M. parishii each carrying organelle genomes nested within respective sympatric M. cardinalis clades. A recent organellar transfer from M. cardinalis, an outcrosser where selfish cytonuclear dynamics are more likely, may account for the unexpected cytoplasmic male sterility effects of selfer M. parishii organelles in hybrids with M. lewisii. Overall, our phylogenomic results reveal extensive reticulation throughout the evolutionary history of a classic monkeyflower radiation, suggesting that natural selection (re-)assembles and maintains species-diagnostic traits and barriers in the face of gene flow. Our findings further underline the challenges, even in reproductively isolated species, in distinguishing re-use of adaptive alleles from true convergence and emphasize the value of a phylogenomic framework for reconstructing the evolutionary genetics of adaptation and speciation.\n\nAuthor SummaryAdaptive radiations, which involve both divergent evolution of new traits and recurrent trait evolution, provide insight into the processes that generate and maintain organismal diversity. However, rapid radiations also generate particular challenges for inferring the evolutionary history and mechanistic basis of adaptation and speciation, as multiple processes can cause different parts of the genome to have distinct phylogenetic trees. Thus, inferences about the mode and timing of divergence and the causes of parallel trait evolution require a fine-grained understanding of the flow of genomic variation through time. In this study, we used genome-wide sampling of thousands of genes to re-construct the evolutionary histories of a model plant radiation, the monkeyflowers of Mimulus section Erythranthe. Work over the past half-century has established the parapatric and putatively sister species M. lewisii (bee-pollinated) and M. cardinalis (hummingbird-pollinated, as are three other species in the section) as textbook examples of both rapid speciation via shifts in pollination syndrome and convergent evolution of floral syndromes. Our phylogenomic analyses re-write both of these stories, placing M. cardinalis in a clade with other hummingbird-pollinated taxa and demonstrating that abundant introgression between ancestral lineages as well as in areas of current sympatry contributes to the real (but misleading) affinities between M. cardinalis and M. lewisii. This work illustrates the pervasive influence of gene flow and introgression during adaptive radiation and speciation, and underlines the necessity of a gene-scale and genome-wide phylogenomics framework for understanding trait divergence, even among well-established species.",

Here, we carried out a large-area micro-X-Ray fluorescence (micro-XRF) analysis on the holotypic specimen of Jianianhualong tengi via a Brucker M6 Jetstream mobile XRF scanner. The elemental distribution measurements of the specimen show an enrichment of typical bones couponing elements such as S, P and Ca allowing to visualize the fossil structure. Additionally, to this, the bones are enriched in several heavier elements such as Sr, Th, Y and Ce over the surrounding rocks. The enrichment is most likely associated to secondary mineralization and the phosphates from the bones. Interestingly the plumage shape correlates with an enrichment in elements such as Cu, Ni and Ti, consistent with a previous study [1] on Archaeopteryx using synchrotron imaging. The analysis presented here provide new biological and taphonomic information of this fossil. An in-situ and nondestructive micro-XRF analysis is currently the most ideal way to map the chemistry of fossils, so far this is manly restricted to small samples. Larger samples usually required a synchrotron facility for analysis. Our study demonstrated that laboratory-based large-area micro-XRF scanner can provides a practical tool for the study of large large-sized specimens allowing collect full chemical data for a better understanding of evolutionary and taphonomic processes.",

During esca, a grapevine (Vitis vinifera) disease, symptomatic leaves are prone to irreversible hydraulic dysfunctions but little is known about the hydraulic integrity of perennial organs over the short- and long-term. We investigated the effects of esca on stem hydraulic integrity in naturally infected plants within a single season and across season(s). We coupled direct (ks) and indirect (kth) hydraulic conductivity measurements, and tylose and vascular pathogen detection with in vivo X-ray microtomography visualizations. We found xylem occlusions (tyloses), and subsequent loss of stem ks, in all of the shoots with severe symptoms (apoplexy) and in more than 60% of the shoots with moderate symptoms (tiger-stripe), and no tyloses in shoots that were currently asymptomatic. In vivo stem observations demonstrated that tyloses were observed only when leaf symptoms appeared, and resulted in more than 50% PLC in 40% of symptomatic stems, unrelated to symptom age. The impact of esca on xylem integrity was only seasonal and no long-term impact of disease history was recorded. Our study demonstrated how and to what extent a vascular disease such as esca, affecting xylem integrity, could amplify plant mortality by hydraulic failure.\n\nHighlightOur study reveals that esca can critically affect xylem water movement in grapevine perennial organs, by the presence of plant-derived tyloses.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of multicellularity was accompanied by the emergence of processes to regulate cell fate, identity and differentiation in a robust and faithful manner. Chromatin regulation has emerged as a key process in development and yet its contribution to the evolution of such processes is largely unexplored. Chromatin is regulated by a diverse set of proteins, which themselves are tightly regulated in order to play cell/ tissue-specific functions. Using the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis, a model for basal metazoans, we explore the function of one such chromatin regulator, Lysine specific demethylase 1 (Lsd1). We generated an endogenously tagged allele and show that the expression of NvLsd1 is developmentally regulated and higher in differentiated neural cells than their progenitors. We further show, using a CRISPR/Cas9 generated mutant that loss of NvLsd1 leads to several distinct developmental abnormalities. Strikingly, NvLsd1 loss leads to the almost complete loss of differentiated cnidocytes, cnidarian-specific neural cells, which we show to be the result of a cell-autonomous requirement for NvLsd1. Together this suggests that complex regulation of developmental processes by chromatin modifying proteins predates the split of the cnidarian and bilaterian lineages, approximately 600 million years ago, and may constitute an ancient feature of animal development.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe pig has long been an important animal species for biomedical research. Recent years has also seen an increasing number of genetically engineered pig models of human diseases including cancer. We previously generated pigs with a modified TP53 allele which carries a Cre-removable transcriptional stop signal in intron 1, and an oncogenic mutation TP53R167H (orthologous to human TP53R175H and mouse Trp53R172H) in exon 5. Pigs with the unrecombined mutant allele (flTP53R167H) develop osteosarcoma (OS) in aged heterozygous and young homozygous animals. In addition, some homozygous animals also developed nephroblastomas and lymphomas. This observation suggested that TP53 gene dysfunction is itself the key initiator of tumorigenesis, but raises the question which aspects of the TP53 regulation leads to the development of such a narrow tumour spectrum, mainly OS.\n\nMethodsWe performed a series of molecular and cellular analyses to study the regulation of TP53 and its family members in both healthy tissue and tumours (n= 48) from flTP53R167H pigs. Human OS cell lines were used to prove relevance to human patients.\n\nResultsMolecular analyses of p53 revealed the presence of two internal TP53 promoters (Pint and P2) equivalent to those found in human. Consequently, both pigs and human express TP53 isoforms. Data presented here strongly suggest that P2-driven expression of the mutant R167H-{Delta}152p53 isoform (equivalent to the human R175H-{Delta}160p53 isoform) and its circular counterpart circTP53 determine the tumour spectrum and play a critical role in the malignant transformation of bones, kidney or spleen in flTP53R167H pigs. The detection of {Delta}152p53 isoform mRNA in serum is indicative of tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we showed a tissue-specific p53-dependent deregulation of the p63 and p73 isoforms in these tumours.\n\nConclusionsThis study highlights important species-specific differences in the transcriptional regulation of TP53. For the first time a circTP53 RNA was identified. Results indicate that the {Delta}152p53 isoform, its circular circTP53 and p53 family members, TAp63{delta} and TAp73{delta}, likely play a role in the malignant transformation of bone and other tumours. Considering the similarities of TP53 regulation between pig and human, these observations provide useful pointers for further investigation into isoform function including the novel circTP53 in both the pig model and human patients.",
