    "abstract": "AimThe evolutionary causes of the latitudinal diversity gradient are debated. Hypotheses have ultimately invoked either faster rates of diversification in the tropics, or more time for diversification due to the tropical origins of higher taxa. Here we perform the first test of the diversification rate and time hypotheses in freshwater ray-finned fishes, a group comprising nearly a quarter of all living vertebrates.\n\nLocationGlobal.\n\nTime period368-0 mya.\n\nMajor taxa studiedExtant freshwater ray-finned fishes.\n\nMethodsUsing a mega-phylogeny of actinopterygian fishes and a global database of occurrence records, we estimated net diversification rates, the number of colonizations and regional colonization times of co-occurring species in freshwater drainage basins. We used Generalized Additive Models to test whether these factors were related to latitude. We then compared the influence of diversification rates, colonization numbers, colonization times and surface area on species richness, and how these factors are related to each other.\n\nResultsWhile both diversification rates and time were related to richness, time had greater explanatory power and was more strongly related to latitude than diversification rates. Other factors (basin surface area, number of colonizations) also helped explain richness but were unrelated to latitude. The worlds most diverse freshwater basins (Amazon, Congo rivers) were dominated by lineages with Mesozoic origins. The temperate groups dominant today arrived near the K-Pg boundary, leaving comparatively less time to build richness. Diversification rates and colonization times were inversely related: recently colonized basins had the fastest rates, while ancient species-rich faunas had slower rates.\n\nMain conclusionsWe concluded that time is the lead driver of latitudinal richness disparities in freshwater fish faunas. We suggest that the most likely path to building very high species richness is through diversification over long periods of time, rather than diversifying quickly.",

    "abstract": "Regulatory elements (REs) consist of enhancers and promoters that occupy a significant portion of the non-coding genome and control gene expression programs either in -cis or in - trans. Putative REs have been identified largely based on their regulatory features (co-occupancy of ESC-specific transcription factors, enhancer histone marks and DNase hypersensitivity) in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). However, less has been established regarding their regulatory functions in their native context. We deployed cis- and trans-regulatory elements scanning through saturating mutagenesis and sequencing (ctSCAN-SMS) to target elements within the [~]12kb cis-region (Cis-REs; CREs) of the Oct4 gene locus, as well as genome-wide 2,613 high-confidence trans-REs (TREs), in mESCs. ctSCAN-SMS identified 10 CREs and 12 TREs, as novel candidate REs of the Oct4 gene in mESCs. Furthermore, deletions of these candidate REs confirmed that the majority of the REs are functionally active, and CREs are more active than TREs in controlling Oct4 gene expression. A subset of active CREs and TREs physically interact with the Oct4 promoter to varying degrees; specifically, a greater number of active CREs compared to active TREs, physically interact with the Oct4 promoter. Moreover, comparative genomics analysis reveals that more number of active CREs than active TREs are evolutionary conserved between mouse and primates, including human. Taken together, our study demonstrates the reliability and robustness of ctSCAN-SMS screening to identify critical REs, and investigate their roles in the regulation of transcriptional output of a target gene (in this case Oct4) in their native context.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWA special class of random walks, so-called Levy walks, has been observed in a variety of organisms ranging from cells, insects, fishes, and birds to mammals, including humans. Although their prevalence is considered to be a consequence of natural selection for higher search efficiency, some findings suggest that Levy walks might also be epiphenomena that arise from interactions with the environment. Therefore, why they are common in biological movements remains an open question. Based on some evidence that Levy walks are spontaneously generated in the brain and the fact that power-law distributions in Levy walks can emerge at a critical point, we hypothesized that the advantages of Levy walks might be enhanced by criticality. However, the functional advantages of Levy walks are poorly understood. Here, we modeled nonlinear systems for the generation of locomotion and showed that Levy walks emerging near a critical point had optimal dynamic ranges for coding information. This discovery suggested that Levy walks could change movement trajectories based on the magnitude of environmental stimuli. We then showed that the high flexibility of Levy walks enabled switching exploitation/exploration based on the nature of external cues. Finally, we analyzed the movement trajectories of freely moving Drosophila larvae and showed empirically that the Levy walks may emerge near a critical point and have the large dynamic range and high flexibility. Our results suggest that the commonly observed Levy walks emerge near a critical point and could be explained on the basis of these functional advantages.",

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) provide a personalized genetic susceptibility profile that may be leveraged for disease prediction. Using data from the UK Biobank (413,753 individuals; 22,755 incident cancer cases), we quantify the added predictive value of integrating cancer-specific PRS with family history and modifiable risk factors for 16 cancers. We show that incorporating PRS measurably improves prediction accuracy for most cancers, but the magnitude of this improvement varies substantially. We also demonstrate that stratifying on levels of PRS identifies significantly divergent 5-year risk trajectories after accounting for family history and modifiable risk factors. At the population level, the top 20% of the PRS distribution accounts for 4.0% to 30.3% of incident cancer cases, exceeding the impact of many lifestyle-related factors. In summary, this study illustrates the potential for improving cancer risk assessment by integrating genetic risk scores.",

    "abstract": "The global neuronal workspace (GNW) model has inspired over two decades of hypothesis driven research on the neural basis consciousness. However, recent studies have reported findings that are at odds with empirical predictions of the model. Further, the macro-anatomical focus of current GNW research has limited the specificity of predictions afforded by the model. In this paper we present a neurocomputational model - based on Active Inference - that captures central architectural elements of the GNW and is able to address these limitations. The resulting  predictive global workspace casts neuronal dynamics as approximating Bayesian inference, allowing precise, testable predictions at both the behavioural and neural levels of description. We report simulations demonstrating the models ability to reproduce: 1) the electrophysiological and behaviour results observed in previous studies of inattentional blindness; and 2) the previously introduced four-way taxonomy predicted by the GNW, which describes the relationship between consciousness, attention, and sensory signal strength. We then illustrate how our model can reconcile/explain (apparently) conflicting findings, extend the GNW taxonomy to include the influence of prior expectations, and inspire novel paradigms to test associated behavioural and neural predictions.",

    "abstract": "Growth cone - mediated axonal outgrowth and accurate synaptic targeting are central to brain morphogenesis. Translocation of the growth cone necessitates mechanochemical regulation of cell - extracellular matrix interactions and the generation of propulsive traction forces onto the growth environment. However, the molecular mechanisms subserving force generation by growth cones remain poorly characterized. The formin family member, Fmn2, has been identified earlier as a regulator of growth cone motility. Here, we explore the mechanisms underlying Fmn2 function in the growth cone. Evaluation of multiple components of the adhesion complexes suggests that Fmn2 regulates point contact stability. Analysis of F-actin retrograde flow reveals that Fmn2 functions as a clutch molecule and mediates the coupling of the actin cytoskeleton to the growth substrate, via point contact adhesion complexes. Using traction force microscopy, we show that the Fmn2-mediated clutch function is necessary for the generation of traction stresses by neurons. Our findings suggest that Fmn2, a protein associated with neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, is a key regulator of a molecular clutch activity and consequently motility of neuronal growth cones.",

    "abstract": "Loss-of-function mutations in SPG11 protein (spatacsin) are a common cause of autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia with thin corpus callosum. To identify regions of the protein that may have functions that are disrupted in disease, we carried out bioinformatic analyses of its conserved regions. An N-terminal region of around 650 amino-acid residues, present in SPG11 across a wide range of metazoan animals, was missing from many insect lineages. Evolutionary loss of this domain correlated with loss of its binding partner, the AP-5 adaptor complex, suggesting that its main function is interaction with AP-5 in intracellular trafficking, and that the remainder of SPG11 carries out AP-5-independent functions. At the C-terminus of SPG11, a spatacsin_C domain showed sequence similarity and predicted structural homology to the Vps16_C domain of the HOPS complex protein Vps16. It localized to acidic compartments, consistent with a role in endolysosomal or autolysosomal transport, like Vps16. Mass spectrometry analysis of binding partners of this domain identified membrane trafficking proteins, some SM proteins, and several aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Since mutations affecting SPG11 or aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases can both cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy (CMT) type 2, we suggest autolysosomal trafficking as a target process in CMT type 2.",

    "abstract": "RationaleDefects in the morphogenesis of the 4th pharyngeal arch arteries (PAAs) give rise to lethal birth defects. Understanding genes and mechanisms regulating PAA formation will provide important insights into the etiology and treatments for congenital heart disease.\n\nObjectiveCell-ECM interactions play essential roles in the morphogenesis of PAAs and their derivatives, the aortic arch artery (AAA) and its major branches; however, their specific functions are not well-understood. Previously, we demonstrated that integrin 5{beta}1 and fibronectin (Fn1) expressed in the Isl1 lineages regulate PAA formation. The objective of these studies was to investigate cellular mechanisms by which integrin 5{beta}1 and Fn1 regulate AAA morphogenesis.\n\nMethods and ResultsUsing temporal lineage tracing, whole-mount confocal imaging, and quantitative analysis of the second heart field (SHF) and endothelial cell (EC) dynamics, we show that the majority of PAA EC progenitors arise by E7.5 in the SHF and populate pharyngeal arch mesenchyme between E7.5 and E9.5. Consequently, SHF-derived ECs in the pharyngeal arches become organized into a uniform plexus of small blood vessels, which becomes remodeled into the PAAs between 31 - 35 somites. The remodeling of the vascular plexus is orchestrated by signals dependent on pharyngeal ECM microenvironment extrinsic to the endothelium. Conditional ablation of integrin 5{beta}1 or Fn1 in the Isl1 lineages showed that signaling by the ECM regulates AAA morphogenesis at multiple steps: 1) the recruitment of the SHF-derived ECs into the pharyngeal arches, 2) the remodeling of the uniform EC plexus in the 4th arches into the PAAs; and 3) differentiation of neural crest-derived cells abutting the PAA endothelium into vascular smooth muscle cells.\n\nConclusionsPAA formation is a multi-step process entailing dynamic contribution of SHF-derived ECs to pharyngeal arches, the remodeling of endothelial plexus into the PAAs, and the remodeling of the PAAs into the AAA and its major branches. Cell-ECM interactions regulated by integrin 5{beta}1 and Fn1 play essential roles at each of these developmental stages.",

    "abstract": "Migraine is the third most prevalent disease worldwide but the mechanisms that underlie migraine chronicity are poorly understood. Cytoskeletal flexibility is fundamental to neuronal-plasticity and is dependent on dynamic microtubules. Histone-deacetylase-6 (HDAC6) decreases microtubule dynamics by deacetylating its primary substrate, -tubulin. We use validated models of migraine to show that HDAC6-inhibition is a promising migraine treatment and reveal an undiscovered cytoarchitectural basis for migraine chronicity. The human migraine trigger, nitroglycerin, produced chronic migraine-associated pain and decreased neurite growth in headache-processing regions, which were reversed by HDAC6 inhibition. Cortical spreading depression (CSD), a physiological correlate of migraine aura, also decreased cortical neurite growth, while HDAC6-inhibitor restored neuronal complexity and decreased CSD. Importantly, a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist also restored blunted neuronal complexity induced by nitroglycerin. Our results demonstrate that disruptions in neuronal cytoarchitecture are a feature of chronic migraine, and effective migraine therapies might include agents that restore microtubule/neuronal plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Proteins are the workhorses of the cell, yet they carry great potential for harm via misfolding and aggregation. Despite the dangers, proteins are sometimes born de novo from non-coding DNA. Proteins are more likely to be born from non-coding regions that produce peptides that do little to no harm when translated than from regions that produce harmful peptides. To investigate which newborn proteins are most likely to \"first, do no harm\", we estimate fitnesses from an experiment that competed Escherichia coli lineages that each expressed a unique random peptide. A variety of peptide metrics significantly predict lineage fitness, but this predictive power stems from simple amino acid frequencies rather than the ordering of amino acids. Amino acids that are smaller and that promote intrinsic structural disorder have more benign fitness effects. We validate that the amino acids that indicate benign effects in random peptides expressed in E. coli also do so in an independent dataset of random N-terminal tags in which it is possible to control for expression level. The same amino acids are also enriched in young animal proteins.\n\nSignificance statementProteins are sometimes born de novo. In an experiment to reproduce this process in Escherichia coli, we were able to predict 15% of the variation in random peptide fitness effects from their amino acid frequencies. In contrast, which order the amino acids are in seems to make no difference, adding no predictive power on top of simple amino acid frequencies. Amino acids that are smaller and promote intrinsic structural disorder have more benign fitness effects.",

Chemotactic signals entail the motor to switch its direction of rotation. However, other factors such as protonmotive force and torque are involved in switching. In this work, we used peritrichously flagellated E.coli that stochastically tethers on surfaces in random geometries and studied how the cell size and position of the rotational axis affect the output of the motor. We developed a Cell Tethering Analysis Program (CTAP) to measure the length of the cells, the axis of rotation, rotational frequency of tethered cells. A D/L ratio (diameter traced by the cell body to the length of the cell body) was used to quantify the location of the rotational axis wherein, a D/L ratio of 1 and 1.9 means the axis of rotation is at the center of the cell body and near the tip of the cell body respectively. We performed experiments in controlled conditions and quantified the effect of cell size and tethering geometry on the output of the flagellar motor. The estimated torque of the tethered cells was 951 pN.nm and 1390 pN.nm for a D/L ratio of [~]1.0 and [~]1.9 respectively. As the torque increased, the motors rotated exclusively in CCW direction. We conclude that quantifying the cell size and tethering geometry is significant to characterize the output of the flagellar motors in a tethered cell assay.",

    "abstract": "Many aspects of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) between-farm transmission dynamics have been investigated, but uncertainty remains about the significance of farm type and different transmission routes on PRRSV spread. We developed a stochastic epidemiological model calibrated on weekly PRRSV outbreaks accounting for the population dynamics in different pig production phases, breeding herds, gilt development units, nurseries, and finisher farms, of three hog producer companies. Our model accounted for indirect contacts by the close distance between farms (local transmission), between-farm animal movements (pig flow), and reinfection of sow farms (re-break). The fitted model was used to examine the effectiveness of vaccination strategies and complementary interventions such as enhanced PRRSV detection and vaccination delays and forecast the spatial distribution of PRRSV outbreak. The results of our analysis indicated that for sow farms, 59% of the simulated infections were related to local transmission (e.g. airborne, feed deliveries, shared equipment) whereas 36% and 5% were related to animal movements and re-break, respectively. For nursery farms, 80% of infections were related to animal movements and 20% to local transmission; while at finisher farms it was split between local transmission and animal movements. Assuming that the current vaccines are 1% effective in mitigating between-farm PRRSV transmission, weaned pigs vaccination would reduce the incidence of PRRSV outbreaks by 2%, indeed under any scenario vaccination alone was insufficient for completely controlling PRRSV spread. Our results also showed that intensifying PRRSV detection and/or vaccination pigs at placement increased the effectiveness of all simulated vaccination strategies. Our model reproduced the incidence and PRRSV spatial distribution; therefore, this model could also be used to map current and future farms at-risk. Finally, this model could be a useful tool for veterinarians, allowing them to identify the effect of transmission routes and different vaccination interventions to control PRRSV spread.",

    "abstract": "Opportunistic pathogens are associated with a number of chronic human infections, yet the evolution of virulence in these organisms during chronic infection remains poorly understood. Here, we tested the evolution of virulence in the human opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a murine chronic wound model using a two-part serial passage and sepsis experiment, and found that virulence evolved in different directions in each line of evolution. We also assessed P. aeruginosa adaptation to a chronic wound after 42 days of evolution, and found that morphological diversity in our evolved populations was limited compared to that previously described in cystic fibrosis (CF) infections. Using whole genome sequencing, we found that genes previously implicated in P. aeruginosa pathogenesis (lasR, pilR, fleQ, rpoN, and pvcA), acquired mutations during the course of evolution in wounds, with some mutations evolving in parallel across all lines of evolution. Our findings highlight that (i) P. aeruginosa heterogeneity may be less extensive in chronic wounds than in CF lungs; (ii) genes involved in P. aeruginosa pathogenesis acquire mutations during chronic wound infection; (iii) similar genetic adaptations are employed by P. aeruginosa across multiple infection environments, and (iv) current models of virulence may not adequately explain the diverging evolutionary trajectories observed in an opportunistic pathogen during chronic wound infection.",

    "abstract": "During the last ten years, many research results have been referring to a particular type of cancer-associated fibroblasts associated with poor prognosis, invasiveness, metastasis and resistance to therapy in multiple cancer types, characterized by a gene expression signature with prominent presence of genes COL11A1, THBS2 and INHBA. Identifying the underlying biological mechanisms responsible for their creation may facilitate the discovery of targets for potential pan-cancer therapeutics. Using a novel computational approach for single-cell gene expression data analysis identifying the dominant cell populations in a sequence of samples from patients at various stages, we conclude that these fibroblasts are produced by a pan-cancer cellular transition originating from a particular type of adipose-derived stromal cells naturally present in the stromal vascular fraction of normal adipose tissue, having a characteristic gene expression signature. Focusing on a rich pancreatic cancer dataset, we provide a detailed description of the continuous modification of the gene expression profiles of cells as they transition from APOD-expressing adipose-derived stromal cells to COL11A1-expressing cancer-associated fibroblasts, identifying the key genes that participate in this transition. These results also provide an explanation to the well-known fact that the adipose microenvironment contributes to cancer progression.\n\nAuthor summaryComputational analysis of rich gene expression data at the single-cell level from cancer biopsies can lead to biological discoveries about the nature of the disease. Using a computational methodology that identifies the gene expression profile of the dominant cell population for a particular cell type in the microenvironment of tumors, we observed that there is a remarkably continuous modification of this profile among patients, corresponding to a cellular transition. Specifically, we found that the starting point of this transition has a unique characteristic signature corresponding to cells that are naturally residing in normal adipose tissue. We also found that the endpoint of the transition has another characteristic signature corresponding to a particular type of cancer-associated fibroblasts with prominent expression of gene COL11A1, which has been found strongly associated with invasiveness, metastasis and resistance to therapy in multiple cancer types. Our results provide an explanation to the well-known fact that the adipose tissue contributes to cancer progression, shedding light on the biological mechanism by which tumor cells interact with the adipose microenvironment. We provide a detailed description of the changing profile during the transition, identifying associated genes as potential targets for pan-cancer therapeutics inhibiting the underlying mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Tauopathies are a group of more than twenty known disorders that involve progressive neurodegeneration, cognitive decline, and pathological tau accumulation. Current therapeutic strategies provide only limited, late-stage symptomatic treatment. This is partly due to lack of understanding of the molecular mechanisms linking tau and cellular dysfunction, especially during the early stages of disease progression. In this study, we treated early stage tau transgenic mice with a multi-target kinase inhibitor to identify novel substrates that contribute to cognitive impairment and exhibit therapeutic potential. Drug treatment significantly ameliorated brain atrophy and cognitive function as determined by behavioral testing and a sensitive imaging technique called manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) with quantitative R1 mapping. Surprisingly, these benefits occurred despite unchanged hyperphosphorylated tau levels. To elucidate the mechanism behind these improved cognitive outcomes, we performed quantitative proteomics to determine the altered protein network during this early stage in tauopathy and compare this model with the human AD proteome. We identified a cluster of preserved pathways shared with human tauopathy with striking potential for broad multi-target kinase intervention. We further report high confidence candidate proteins as novel therapeutically relevant targets for the treatment of tauopathy.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryMulti-target kinase inhibition rescues cognitive function in early stage tauopathy mice and reverses proteomic shifts common to Alzheimers disease in humans.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDSex differences in incidence and/or presentation of schizophrenia (SCZ), major depressive disorder (MDD), and bipolar disorder (BIP) are pervasive. Previous evidence for shared genetic risk and sex differences in brain abnormalities across disorders suggest possible shared sex-dependent genetic risk.\n\nMETHODSWe conducted the largest to date genome-wide genotype-by-sex (GxS) interaction of risk for these disorders, using 85,735 cases (33,403 SCZ, 19,924 BIP, 32,408 MDD) and 109,946 controls from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) and iPSYCH.\n\nRESULTSAcross disorders, genome-wide significant SNP-by-sex interaction was detected for a locus encompassing NKAIN2 (rs117780815; p=3.2x10-8), that interacts with sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase enzymes implicating neuronal excitability. Three additional loci showed evidence (p<1x10-6) for cross-disorder GxS interaction (rs7302529, p=1.6x10-7; rs73033497, p=8.8x10-7; rs7914279, p=6.4x10-7) implicating various functions. Gene-based analyses identified GxS interaction across disorders (p=8.97x10-7) with transcriptional inhibitor SLTM. Most significant in SCZ was a MOCOS gene locus (rs11665282; p=1.5x10-7), implicating vascular endothelial cells. Secondary analysis of the PGC-SCZ dataset detected an interaction (rs13265509; p=1.1x10-7) in a locus containing IDO2, a kynurenine pathway enzyme with immunoregulatory functions implicated in SCZ, BIP, and MDD. Pathway enrichment analysis detected significant GxS of genes regulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor signaling in MDD (pFDR<0.05).\n\nCONCLUSIONSIn the largest genome-wide GxS analysis of mood and psychotic disorders to date, there was substantial genetic overlap between the sexes. However, significant sex-dependent effects were enriched for genes related to neuronal development, immune and vascular functions across and within SCZ, BIP, and MDD at the variant, gene, and pathway enrichment levels.",

Use of the model revealed the mechanisms by which individual disorders, such as steatosis, {beta} cell dysfunction and insulin resistance, were combined to cause type 2 diabetes. The model predicted a glycerol kinase inhibitor to be an effective medicine for type 2 diabetes, which not only decreased hepatic triglyceride but also reduced plasma glucose.

    "abstract": "Resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) that activate T cell mediated anti-tumor immunity is a key challenge in cancer therapy, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. To further elucidate those, we developed a new approach, Perturb-CITE-seq, for pooled CRISPR perturbation screens with multi-modal RNA and protein single-cell profiling readout and applied it to screen patient-derived autologous melanoma and tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) co-cultures. We profiled RNA and 20 surface proteins in over 218,000 cells under ~750 perturbations, chosen by their membership in an immune evasion program that is associated with immunotherapy resistance in patients. Our screen recovered clinically-relevant resistance mechanisms concordantly reflected in RNA, protein and perturbation effects on susceptibility to T cell mediated killing. These were organized in eight co-functional modules whose perturbation distinctly affect four co-regulated programs associated with immune evasion. Among these were defects in the IFN{gamma}-JAK/STAT pathway and in antigen presentation, and several novel mechanisms, including loss or downregulation of CD58, a surface protein without known mouse homolog. Leveraging the rich profiles in our screen, we found that loss of CD58 did not compromise MHC protein expression and that CD58 was not transcriptionally induced by the IFN{gamma} pathway, allowing us to distinguish it as a novel mechanism of immune resistance. We further show that loss of CD58 on cancer cells conferred immune evasion across multiple T cell and Natural Killer cell patient co-culture models. Notably, CD58 is downregulated in tumors with resistance to immunotherapy in melanoma patients. Our work identifies novel mechanisms at the nexus of immune evasion and drug resistance and provides a general framework for deciphering complex mechanisms by large-scale perturbation screens with multi-modal singlecell profiles, including in systems consisting of multiple cell types.",

    "abstract": "Host cellular receptors are key determinants of virus tropism and pathogenesis. Virus utilizes multiple receptors for attachment, entry, or specific host responses. However, other than ACE2, little is known about SARS-CoV-2 receptors. Furthermore, ACE2 cannot easily interpret the multi-organ tropisms of SARS-CoV-2 nor the clinical differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. To identify host cell receptors involved in SARS-CoV-2 interactions, we performed genomic receptor profiling to screen almost all human membrane proteins, with SARS-CoV-2 capsid spike (S) protein as the target. Twelve receptors were identified, including ACE2. Most receptors bind at least two domains on S protein, the receptor-binding-domain (RBD) and the N-terminal-domain (NTD), suggesting both are critical for virus-host interaction. Ectopic expression of ASGR1 or KREMEN1 is sufficient to enable entry of SARS-CoV-2, but not SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Analyzing single-cell transcriptome profiles from COVID-19 patients revealed that virus susceptibility in airway epithelial ciliated and secretory cells and immune macrophages highly correlates with expression of ACE2, KREMEN1 and ASGR1 respectively, and ACE2/ASGR1/KREMEN1 (ASK) together displayed a much better correlation than any individual receptor. Based on modeling of systemic SARS-CoV-2 host interactions through S receptors, we revealed ASK correlation with SARS-CoV-2 multi-organ tropism and provided potential explanations for various COVID-19 symptoms. Our study identified a panel of SARS-CoV-2 receptors with diverse binding properties, biological functions, and clinical correlations or implications, including ASGR1 and KREMEN1 as the alternative entry receptors, providing insights into critical interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with host, as well as a useful resource and potential drug targets for COVID-19 investigation.",

Nevertheless, the cellular source of RANKL for osteoclastogenesis has not been fully uncovered. Different from peripheral adipose tissue, bone marrow (BM) adipose lineage cells originate from bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells(BMSCs). Here we demonstrate that adiponectin promoter-driven Cre expression (AdipoqCre) can target bone marrow adipose lineage cells. We cross the AdipoqCre mice with ranklfl/fl mice to conditionally delete RANKL from BM adipose lineage cells. Conditional deletion of RANKL increases cancellous bone mass of long bones in mice by reducing the formation of trabecular osteoclasts and inhibiting bone resorption but does not affect cortical bone thickness or resorption of calcified cartilage. AdipoqCre; ranklfl/fl mice exhibit resistance to estrogen deficiency and rosiglitazone (ROS) induced trabecular bone loss but show bone loss induced by unloading. BM adipose lineage cells therefore represent an essential source of RANKL for the formation of trabecula osteoclasts and resorption of cancellous bone during remodeling under physiological and pathological conditions. Targeting bone marrow adiposity is a promising way of preventing pathological bone loss.",

    "abstract": "The tree bark environment is an important microbial habitat distributed worldwide on thrillions of trees. However, the microbial communities of tree bark are largely unknown, with most studies on plant aerial surfaces focused on the leaves. Recently, we presented a metagenomic study of bark microbial communities from avocado. In these communities, oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis genes were very abundant, especially when compared to rhizospheric soil from the same trees. In this work, Evolutionary Placement Algorithm analysis was performed on metagenomic reads orthologous to the PufLM gene cluster, encoding for the bacterial type II photosynthetic reaction center. These photosynthetic genes were found affiliated to different groups of bacteria, mostly aerobic anoxygenic photosynthetic Alphaproteobacteria, including Sphingomonas, Methylobacterium and several Rhodospirillales. These results suggest that anoxygenic photosynthesis in avocado bark microbial communities functions primarily as additional energy source for heterotrophic growth. Together with our previous results, showing a large abundance of cyanobacteria in these communities, a picture emerges of the tree holobiont, where light penetrating the trees canopies and reaching the inner stems, including the trunk, is probably utilized by cyanobacteria for oxygenic photosynthesis, and the far-red light aids the growth of aerobic anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria.",

Here we present POME, a semi-automated pipeline for the quantification of cell polarity, and demonstrate its application to a variety of developmental contexts. POME analysis reveals that during asymmetric cell divisions in the Arabidopsis thaliana stomatal lineage, polarity proteins BASL and BRXL2 are more asynchronous and less mutually dependent than previously thought. While their interaction is important to maintain their polar localization and recruit other effectors to regulate asymmetric cell divisions, BRXL2 polarization precedes that of BASL and can be initiated in BASLs absence. Uncoupling of polarization from BASL activity is also seen in Brachypodium distachyon, where we find that the MAPKKK BdYDA1 is segregated and polarized following asymmetric division. Our results demonstrate that POME is a versatile tool, which by itself or combined with tissue-level studies and advanced microscopy techniques can help uncover new mechanisms of cell polarity.",

    "abstract": "Most predictive models based on gene expression data do not leverage information related to gene splicing, despite the fact that splicing is a fundamental feature of eukaryotic gene expression. Cigarette smoking is an important environmental risk factor for many diseases, and it has profound effects on gene expression. Using smoking status as a prediction target, we developed deep neural network predictive models using gene, exon, and isoform level quantifications from RNA sequencing data in over 2,000 subjects in the COPDGene Study. We observed that models using exon and isoform quantifications clearly outperformed gene-level models when using data from 5 genes from a previously published five gene prediction model. Whereas the test set performance of the previously published model was 0.82 in the original publication, our exon-based models including an exon-to-isoform mapping layer achieved a test set AUC of 0.88 using data from the same 5 genes and an AUC of 0.94 using a larger set of exon quantifications. Isoform variability is an important source of latent information in RNA-seq data that can be used to improve clinical prediction models.\n\nAuthor summaryPredictive models based on gene expression are already a part of medical decision making for selected situations such as early breast cancer treatment. Most of these models are based on measures that do not capture critical aspects of gene splicing, but with RNA sequencing it is possible to capture some of these aspects of alternative splicing and use them to improve clinical predictions. Building on previous models to predict cigarette smoking status, we show that measures of alternative splicing significantly improve the accuracy of these predictive models.",

    "abstract": "We present a new high-quality, single-subject atlas with sub-millimeter voxel resolution, high SNR, and excellent grey-white tissue contrast to resolve fine anatomical details. The atlas is labeled into two parcellation schemes: 1) the anatomical BCI-DNI atlas, which is manually labeled based on known morphological and anatomical features, and 2) the hybrid USCBrain atlas, which incorporates functional information to guide the sub-parcellation of cerebral cortex. In both cases, we provide consistent volumetric and cortical surface-based parcellation and labeling. The intended use of the atlas is as a reference template for structural coregistration and labeling of individual brains. A single-subject T1-weighted image was acquired at a resolution of 0.547mm x 0.547mm x 0.800mm five times and averaged. Images were processed by an expert neuroanatomist using semi-automated methods in BrainSuite to extract the brain, classify tissue-types, and render anatomical surfaces. Sixty-six cortical and 29 noncortical regions were manually labeled to generate the BCI-DNI atlas. The cortical regions were further sub-parcellated into 130 cortical regions based on multi-subject connectivity analysis using resting fMRI (rfMRI) data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) database to produce the USCBrain atlas. In addition, we provide a delineation between sulcal valleys and gyral crowns, which offer an additional set of 26 sulcal subregions per hemisphere. Lastly, a probabilistic map is provided to give users a quantitative measure of reliability for each gyral subdivision. Utility of the atlas was assessed by computing adjusted Rand indices between individual sub-parcellations obtained through structural-only coregistration to the USCBrain atlas and sub-parcellations obtained directly from each subjects resting fMRI data. Both atlas parcellations can be used with the BrainSuite, FreeSurfer, and FSL software packages.",

    "abstract": "The shelterin complex consisting of TRF1, TRF2, RAP1, TIN2, TPP1, and POT1, functions to prevent false recognition of telomeres as double-strand DNA breaks, and to regulate telomerase and DNA repair protein access. TIN2 is a core component linking double-stranded telomeric DNA binding proteins (TRF1 and TRF2) and proteins at the 3 overhang (TPP1-POT1). Since knockdown of TIN2 also removes TRF1 and TRF2 from telomeres, determining TIN2s unique mechanistic function has been elusive. Here, we investigated DNA molecular structures promoted by TRF1-TIN2 using complementary single-molecule imaging platforms, including atomic force microscopy (AFM), total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), and the DNA tightrope assay. We demonstrate that TIN2S and TIN2L isoforms facilitate TRF1-mediated DNA compaction (cis-interactions) and DNA-DNA bridging (trans-interactions) in a telomeric sequence- and length-dependent manner. On the short telomeric DNA substrate (6 TTAGGG repeats), the majority of TRF1 mediated telomeric DNA-DNA bridging events are transient with a lifetime of ~1.95 s. On longer DNA substrates (270 TTAGGG), TIN2 forms multi-protein complexes with TRF1 and stabilizes TRF1-mediated DNA-DNA bridging events that last for at least minutes. Preincubation of TRF1 with its regulator protein Tankyrase 1 significantly reduces TRF1-TIN2 mediated DNA-DNA bridging, whereas TIN2 protects the disassembly of TRF1-TIN2 mediated DNA-DNA bridging upon Tankyrase 1 addition. Our study provides evidence that TIN2 functions to promote TRF1 mediated trans-interactions of telomeric DNA, leading to new mechanistic insight into sister telomere cohesion.",

There are several methods of engineering the code, which allow us for storing new genetic information in DNA sequences and transmitting it into the protein world. Here, we investigate the problem of optimal genetic code extension from theoretical perspective. We assume that the new coding system should encode both canonical and new ncAAs using 64 classical codons. What is more, the extended genetic code should be robust to point nucleotide mutation and minimize the possibility of reversion from new to old information. In order to do so, we follow graph theory to study the properties of optimal codon sets, which can encode 20 canonical amino acids and stop coding signal. Finally, we describe the set of vacant codons that could be assigned to new amino acids. Moreover, we discuss the optimal number of the newly incorporated ncAAs and also the optimal size of codon blocks that are assigned to ncAAs.",

    "abstract": "Spatiotemporal compartmentation of calcium dynamics is critical for neuronal function, particularly in post-synaptic spines. This exquisite level of Ca2+ compartmentalization is achieved through the storage and release of Ca2+ from various intracellular organelles particularly the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the mitochondria. Mitochondria and ER are established storage organelles controlling Ca2+ dynamics in neurons. Mitochondria also generate a majority of energy used within postsynaptic spines to support the downstream events associated with neuronal stimulus. Recently, high resolution microscopy has unveiled direct contact sites between the ER and the mitochondria, which directly channel Ca2+ release from the ER into the mitochondrial membrane. In this study, we develop a computational 3D reaction-diffusion model to investigate the role of MERCs in regulating Ca2+ and ATP dynamics. This spatiotemporal model accounts for Ca2+ oscillations initiated by glutamate stimulus of metabotropic and ionotropic glutamate receptors and Ca2+ changes in four different compartments: cytosol, ER, mitochondria, and the MERC microdomain. Our simulations predict that the organization of these organelles and differential distribution of key Ca2+ channels such as IP3 receptor and ryanodine receptor modulate Ca2+ dynamics in response to different stimuli. We further show that the crosstalk between geometry (mitochondria and MERC) and metabolic parameters (cytosolic ATP hydrolysis, ATP generation) influences the cellular energy state. Our findings shed light on the importance of organelle interactions in predicting Ca2+ dynamics in synaptic signaling. Overall, our model predicts that a combination of MERC linkage and mitochondria size is necessary for optimal ATP production in the cytosol.",

The Cordillera de Talamanca (Costa Rica and Panama) is a geographically isolated mountain chain and global biodiversity hotspot, home to more than 50 endemic bird species. We used eBird community science observations to predict the distributions of a suite of 48 of these endemic birds in 2006-2015, and in 2070, under four climate change scenarios. Species distributions were predicted using program Maxent, incorporating elevation, satellite derived habitat data, and WorldClim climate variables. Model fit, as assessed by Area under the Receiver Operator Curve (AUC) was very high for most species, ranging from 0.877 to 0.992 (mean of 0.94). We found that most species are predicted to undergo range contractions by 2070, with a mean of 15% under modest climate change (RCP 2.6) up to a mean of 40% under more severe climate change (RCP 8.5). Most of the current ranges of these species are within existing protected areas (average of 59% in 2006-2015), and with prospective range contractions, the importance of these protected areas is forecast to increase. We suggest that these predicted range declines should elevate conservation concerns for this suite of species, and vigilance, in the form of better population monitoring, is urgently needed.",

    "abstract": "Bird ringing is used for a long time for scientific investigation of migration routes and to better understand breeding events as well as population ecological aspects. It is applied as an inexpensive method although the well-known and major disadvantage of bird ringing is the usually low response rate. In the case of rarer species such as the Red-Footed Falcon (RFF), however, this quota could be higher due to the exclusivity and greater attention of observers. Motivated by own field observations of color-ringed RFF south of Brunswick, Germany in 2019 and no clear and comprehensive publication of verified additional recoveries and ringings, we did further research regarding this issue by following methods: 1) Contacting European Bird Ringing Centers and associated projects, 2) Query and comparison of files with the three national German Bird Ringing Stations, 3) Expanded literature research, 4) Evaluating reports in the citizen science platform ornitho.de, 5) Checking websites of ringing projects (in particular satellite tracking programs) and 6) Own observations.\n\nSurprisingly, this study revealed 18 recovered RFF ringed in foreign countries (14 Hungary, 3 Italy, 1 Romania (GPS tracked bird)) during migration or post-nuptial pre-migration time. Additionally, 1 RFF that was caught and ringed in Germany was recovered abroad.\n\nThis result updates and increases the number of recoveries of RFF in Germany compared to the actual published state on the order of 18 (so far none) and on the order of 6 concerning ID-encoded RFF (GPS-bird excluded) compared to documentation state of the three Bird Ringing Centers in Germany (so far 3 at Beringungszentrale [BZ] Hiddensee, 1 at Institut fur Vogelforschung [IfV] Heligoland). Our research and evaluation of raw data succeeded to a 100% identification rate of the birds origin countries (n=18) while the rate of ID-encoded RFF by color ring codes revealed 58.8% (n=10, GPS-bird excluded). The reported-by-observer response rate was 41.2%. Interesting data of about the phenology, age and origin of the RFF recovered in Germany are presented. Questions and considerations about the recent reporting system of ringed birds and the increased numbers of RFF during the last years in Germany are discussed.",

Here, we explicitly test the general hypothesis that desert-dwelling mammals have evolved increased ability to concentrate urine compared to non-desert species, controlling for body mass and other covariates. Phylogenetic generalized least-squares models show that the mean aridity index of a species distribution range largely predicts its urine concentrating ability, even when accounting for body mass differences and phylogenetic correlations.

Woodpeckers select nesting sites with high food availability and will excavate and then abandon multiple cavities through their lifetime.

We used model averaging to fit species-specific logistic regression models to predict nest success based on cavity metrics across all species.\nC_LIO_LISites occupied by GFWO had a higher biomass of insects in orders Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, and Orthoptera than unoccupied sites, and there was a negative correlation between the availability of these insect orders and home-range size.

Additionally, the prevalence for GFWO to excavate cavities in trees with lower levels of decay contradicts previous literature and may indicate a novel temperature trade-off, with live trees requiring more energy to excavate, but providing more protection from high breeding season temperatures in arid and semi-arid areas.\nC_LI",

However, despite the sophistication of current research, basic conceptual issues remain unresolved. These include (1) the mechanistic origins of spatial organisation within the segment addition zone (SAZ); (2) the mechanistic origins of segment polarisation; (3) the mechanistic origins of axial variation; and (4) the evolutionary origins of simultaneous patterning. Here, I explore these problems using coarse-grained models of cross-regulating dynamical processes. In the morphogenetic framework of a row of cells undergoing axial elongation, I simulate interactions between an \"oscillator\", a \"switch\", and up to three \"timers\", successfully reproducing essential patterning behaviours of segmenting systems. By comparing the output of these largely cell-autonomous models to variants that incorporate positional information, I find that scaling relationships, wave patterns, and patterning dynamics all depend on whether the SAZ is regulated by temporal or spatial information. I also identify three mechanisms for polarising oscillator output, all of which functionally implicate the oscillator frequency profile. Finally, I demonstrate significant dynamical and regulatory continuity between sequential and simultaneous modes of segmentation. I discuss these results in the context of the experimental literature.",

    "abstract": "The aggregation state and endosomal trapping of engineered nanocarriers once internalized into cells remain poorly characterized. Here, we visualized the membrane penetrating dynamics of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) into the cytosol of T cells on a single-cell and single-nanoparticle basis. We water solubilized CdSe/CdZnS QDs with polymer encapsulants functionalized with a cell-penetrating peptide composed of an Asp-Ser-Ser (DSS) repeat sequence. T cells tolerated the 24-h incubation with QDs at concentrations of 5 nM or lower. Single-particle imaging demonstrated that the number of internalized nanoparticles was dependent upon the concentration of the probes for both control (peptide-free) and DSS-QDs. DSS-QDs were mostly distributed as monomers, whereas the control QDs were aggregated into clusters. Single-particle tracking using total internal reflection and highly inclined illumination showed that DSS-QDs were stationary near the activating surface and mobile within the cytosol of the T cell. A correlation exhibited between the mobility and aggregation state of individual QD clusters, with monomeric DSS-QDs showing the highest mobility. In addition, monomeric DSS-QDs displayed much faster diffusion than the endosomes. A small-molecule endosome marker confirmed the absence of colocalization between endosomes and DSS-QDs, indicating their endosomal escape. The ability to deliver and track individual QDs in the cytosol of live T cells creates inroads for the optimization of drug delivery and gene therapy through the use of nanoparticles.",

    "abstract": "Multimeric cytoskeletal protein complexes orchestrate normal cellular function. However, protein-complex distributions in stressed, heterogeneous cell populations remain unknown. Cell staining and proximity-based methods have limited selectivity and/or sensitivity for endogenous multimeric protein-complex quantification from single cells. We introduce micro-arrayed, differential detergent fractionation to simultaneously detect protein complexes in 100s of individual cells. Fractionation occurs by 60 s size-exclusion electrophoresis with protein complex-stabilizing buffer that minimizes depolymerization. Co-detection of cytoskeletal protein complexes in U2OS cells treated with filamentous actin (F-actin) destabilizing LatA detects a subpopulation (~11%) exhibiting downregulated F-actin, but upregulated microtubule and intermediate filament protein complexes. Thus, some cells upregulate other cytoskeletal complexes to counteract the stress of LatA treatment. We also sought to understand the effect of non-chemical stress on cellular heterogeneity of F-actin. We find heat shock dysregulates F- and G-actin correlation. The assay overcomes selectivity limitations to biochemically quantify single-cell protein complexes perturbed with diverse stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Previously we reported that mitochondrial fission regulator 2 (MTFR2, also termed DUFD1 or FAM54A) is co-transcribed with core centromere/kinetochore components, indicating a possible role in mitosis regulation. Here we show that human MTFR2 is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein and participates in DRP1 dependent mitochondrial fission. Multiple MTFR2 variants identified in cancer samples are defective in triggering mitochondrial fission. Inducible MTFR2 depletion caused prolonged mitotic duration and increased chromosome mis-segregation, resulting in multi-nucleated daughter cells. MTFR2 knockout cells accumulated spindle defects, producing either multipolar spindles or short oscillating spindles due to loss of astral microtubules. MTFR2 is phosphorylated during mitosis. The phosphorylation mutant, as well as the cancer variants, failed to correct the prolonged mitotic duration. MTFR2 knockout also rendered cells more resistant to apoptosis caused by taxol treatment. As overexpressing MFN1 or DRP1-K38A also caused spindle defects, we conclude that mitochondrial fragmentation during mitosis ensures spindle integrity and chromosomal stability, and MTFR2 plays a critical role in bridging proper mitochondrial fission and chromosome segregation.",

    "abstract": "The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the acute respiratory disease COVID-19, which has become a global concern due to its rapid spread. Laboratory work with SARS-CoV-2 in a laboratory setting was rated to biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) biocontainment level. However, certain research applications in particular in molecular biology require incomplete denaturation of the proteins, which might cause safety issues handling contaminated samples. In particular, it is critical to provide proof of inactivation before samples can be removed from the BSL-3.\n\nIn this study, the stability of the virus in cell culture media at 4{degrees}C and on touch panel surfaces used in laboratory environment was analyzed. In addition, we evaluated common lysis buffers that are used in molecular biological laboratories for their ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. We have found that guanidine thiocyanate and most of the tested detergent containing lysis buffers were effective in inactivation of SARS-CoV-2, however, the M-PER lysis buffer containing a proprietary detergent failed to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we compared chemical and non-chemical inactivation methods including ethanol, acetone-methanol mixture, PFA, UV-C light, and heat inactivation.\n\nIn conclusion, careful evaluation of the used inactivation methods are required and additional inactivation steps are necessary before removal of lysed viral samples from BSL-3.",

    "abstract": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) maintains cardiovascular and renal homeostasis but also serves as the entry receptor for the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1. COVID-19 disease severity, while highly variable, is typically lower in pediatric patients than adults (particularly the elderly), but increased rates of hospitalizations requiring intensive care are observed in infants than in older children. The reasons for these differences are unknown. To detect potential age-based correlates of disease severity, we measured ACE2 protein expression at the single cell level in human lung tissue specimens from over 100 donors from [~]4 months to 75 years of age. We found that expression of ACE2 in distal lung epithelial cells generally increases with advancing age but exhibits extreme intra- and inter-individual heterogeneity. Notably, we also detected ACE2 expression on neonatal airway epithelial cells and within the lung parenchyma. Similar patterns were found at the transcript level: ACE2 mRNA is expressed in the lung and trachea shortly after birth, downregulated during childhood, and again expressed at high levels in late adulthood in alveolar epithelial cells. Furthermore, we find that apoptosis, which is a natural host defense system against viral infection, is also dynamically regulated during lung maturation, resulting in periods of heightened apoptotic priming and dependence on pro-survival BCL-2 family proteins including MCL-1. Infection of human lung cells with SARS-CoV-2 triggers an unfolded protein stress response and upregulation of the endogenous MCL-1 inhibitor Noxa; in juveniles, MCL-1 inhibition is sufficient to trigger apoptosis in lung epithelial cells - this may limit virion production and inflammatory signaling. Overall, we identify strong and distinct correlates of COVID-19 disease severity across lifespan and advance our understanding of the regulation of ACE2 and cell death programs in the mammalian lung. Furthermore, our work provides the framework for potential translation of apoptosis modulating drugs as novel treatments for COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Advances in Nanopore single-molecule direct RNA sequencing (DRS) have presented the possibility of detecting comprehensive post-transcriptional modifications (PTMs) as an alternative to experimental approaches combined with high-throughput sequencing. It has been shown that the DRS method can detect the change in the raw electric current signal of a PTM; however, the accuracy and reliability still require improvement. Here, I present a new software program, named as nanoDoc, for detecting PTMs from DRS data using a deep neural network. Current signal deviations caused by PTMs are analyzed via Deep One-Class Classification with a convolutional neural network. Using a ribosomal RNA dataset, the software archive displayed an area under the curve (AUC) accuracy of 0.96 for detecting 23 different types of modifications in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Furthermore, I demonstrated a tentative classification of PTMs using unsupervised clustering. Finally, I applied this software to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 data and identified commonly modified sites among three groups. nanoDoc is an open source software (GPLv3) available at https://github.com/uedaLabR/nanoDoc\n\nAuthor SummaryRNA post-transcriptional modifications (PTMs) is regulate multiple aspects of RNA function, including alternative splicing, export, stability, and translation, and the method to identify multiple types of PTMs is required for further advancement of this fields called  epitranscriptomics. Nanopore singlemolecule direct RNA sequencing (DRS) can detect such PTMs, however the accuracy of the method needs to be improved. Detecting PTMs can be solved as a One-Class Classification problem, which is widely used in machine learning fields. Thus, a novel software named  nanoDoc for detecting PTMs was developed. The nanoDoc use convolutional neural network to extract the feature signal from nanopore sequencer and Deep One-Class Classification to detect PTMs as an anomaly. The software archive displayed an area under the curve (AUC) accuracy of 0.96 for detecting 23 different types of modifications in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This software is applicable to different samples, and tested on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and human transcript data as well.",

    "abstract": "Floating-Harbor syndrome (FHS) is a rare genetic disease affecting human development caused by heterozygous truncating mutations in the Srcap gene, which encodes the ATPase SRCAP, the core catalytic subunit of the homonymous chromatin-remodeling complex. Using a combined approach, we studied the involvement of SRCAP protein in cell cycle progression in HeLa cells. In addition to the canonical localization in interphase nuclei, both SRCAP and its Drosophila orthologue DOMINO-A localized to the mitotic apparatus after nuclear envelope breakdown. Moreover, SRCAP and DOMINO-A depletion impaired mitosis and cytokinesis in human and Drosophila cells, respectively. Importantly, SRCAP interacted with several cytokinesis regulators at telophase, strongly supporting a direct role in cytokinesis, independent of its chromatin remodeling functions. Our results provide clues about previously undetected, evolutionarily conserved roles of SRCAP in ensuring proper mitosis and cytokinesis. We propose that perturbations in cell division contribute to the onset of developmental defects characteristic of FHS.\n\nSummaryO_ST_ABSSignificance statementC_ST_ABSSrcap is the causative gene of the rare Floating Harbor syndrome (FHS). It encodes the ATPase SRCAP, the core catalytic subunit of the homonymous multiprotein chromatin-remodeling complex in humans, which promotes the exchange of canonical histone H2A with the H2A.Z variant. According to the current view on SRCAP protein functions, FHS is caused by chromatin remodeling defects. Our findings suggest that, in addition to the established function as epigenetic regulator, SRCAP plays previously undetected and evolutionarily conserved roles in cell division. Hence, we propose that perturbations in cell division produced by SRCAP mutations are important causative factors co-occurring at the onset of FHS.",

A precise molecular understanding of how the entire sarcomere is built is required to understand its role in health, disease and ageing. Here, we determine the in situ molecular architecture of vertebrate skeletal sarcomeres through electron cryo-tomography of cryo-focused ion beam-milled native myofibrils. The reconstructions reveal the three-dimensional organisation and interaction of actin and myosin filaments in the A-band, I-band and Z-disc and demonstrate how  -actinin cross-links antiparallel actin filaments to form a mesh-like structure in the Z-disc at an unprecedented level of molecular detail. A prominent feature is a so-far undescribed doublet of -actinin cross-links with [~] 6 nm spacing. Sub-volume averaging shows the interaction between myosin, tropomyosin and actin in molecular detail at [~] 10 [A] resolution and reveals two coexisting conformations of actin-bound heads. The flexible orientation of the lever arm and the essential and regulatory light chains allow the two heads of the \"double-headed\" myosin not only to interact with the same actin filament but also to split between two actin filaments. Our results provide new insights into the conformational plasticity and fundamental organisation of vertebrate skeletal muscle and serve as a strong foundation for future in situ investigations of muscle diseases.",

In the embryo, HSCs arise from a defined subset of arterial endothelial cells (ECs) located in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region that undergo endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT). Arterialization and HSC development are generally believed to require the action of Notch. Here we show that although Notch activity is initially required for arterialization, it is detrimental to subsequent EHT. Mechanistically, we show that effective EHT depends on a Mfng-induced decrease in Jag1-Notch signaling in hemogenic ECs. This causes upregulation of Mycn, an important metabolic and cell-cycle regulator that we found to be required for EHT. During the subsequent development of hematopoietic lineages, Mycn expression decreases and its function is taken on by the homologous Myc gene.",

The FAA synthesis, monitored using in situ NMR, FT-IR and thin-layer chromatography, was catalyzed efficiently by the immobilized Candida rugosa lipase. The synthesized FAAs exhibited a significant antimicrobial activity, especially those containing oleic acid in high proportions (i.e. derived from Olive oil and U. isabellina oil), against several human pathogenic microorganisms, insecticidal activity against yellow fever mosquito, especially those of C. echinulata containing gamma linolenic acid, and anti-cancer properties against SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cell line, especially those containing EPA in their structures (i.e. EPA concentrate and N. gaditana oil). We conclude that FAAs can be efficiently synthesized using microbial oils of different fatty acid composition and used in specific biological applications.",

Here we report a crystal structure of the cadherin-like module (CLD1-4) from zebrafish RET revealing interdomain flexibility between CLD2-CLD3. Comparison with a cryo-EM structure of a ligand-engaged zebrafish RETECD-GDNF-GFR1 complex indicates conformational changes within a clade-specific CLD3 loop adjacent to co-receptor.

We also visualise linear arrays of RETECD-GDNF-GFR1 suggesting a conserved contact stabilises higher-order species.

    "abstract": "Hsp90 is a conserved and essential molecular chaperone responsible for the folding and activation of hundreds of  client proteins1,2. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a model client that constantly depends on Hsp90 for activity3. Previously, we revealed GR ligand binding is inhibited by Hsp70 and restored by Hsp90, aided by the cochaperone p234. However, a molecular understanding of the chaperone-induced transformations that occur between the inactive Hsp70:Hsp90  client-loading complex and an activated Hsp90:p23  client-maturation complex is lacking for GR, or for any client. Here, we present a 2.56[A] cryo-EM structure of the GR-maturation complex (GR:Hsp90:p23), revealing that the GR ligand binding domain is, surprisingly, restored to a folded, ligand-bound conformation, while simultaneously threaded through the Hsp90 lumen. Also, unexpectedly, p23 directly stabilizes native GR using a previously uncharacterized C-terminal helix, resulting in enhanced ligand-binding. This is the highest resolution Hsp90 structure to date and the first atomic resolution structure of a client bound to Hsp90 in a native conformation, sharply contrasting with the unfolded kinase:Hsp90 structure5. Thus, aided by direct cochaperone:client interactions, Hsp90 dictates client-specific folding outcomes. Together with the GR-loading complex structure (Wang et al. 2020), we present the molecular mechanism of chaperone-mediated GR remodeling, establishing the first complete chaperone cycle for any client.",

    "abstract": "Prior chemotherapy and/or underlying morbidity commonly leads to poor mobilisation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) for transplantation in cancer patients. Increasing the number of available HSC prior to mobilisation is a potential strategy to overcome this deficiency. Resident bone marrow (BM) macrophages are essential for maintenance of niches that support HSC and enable engraftment in transplant recipients. Here we examined potential of donor treatment with colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF1) to modify the BM niche and expand the potential HSC pool for autologous transplantation. We administrated CSF1 Fc fusion protein (CSF1-Fc) to naive C57Bl/6 mice and assessed the impacts on HSC number and function and overall haematopoiesis. Outcomes were assessed by in situ imaging and ex vivo flow cytometry with functional validation by colony formation and competitive transplantation assay. CSF1-Fc treatment caused a transient expansion of monocyte-macrophage cells within BM and spleen at the expense of BM B lymphopoiesis and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) homeostasis. During the recovery phase after cessation of CSF1-Fc treatment, normalisation of haematopoiesis was accompanied by an increase in the total available HSPC pool. In the spleen, increased HSC was associated with expression of the BM niche marker CD169 in red pulp macrophages. Pre-treatment with CSF1-Fc increased the number and reconstitution potential of HSPC in blood following a HSC mobilising regimen of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment. These results indicate that CSF1-Fc conditioning could represent a therapeutic strategy to overcome poor HSC mobilisation and subsequently improve autologous or heterologous HSC transplantation outcomes.\n\nKey points1) Recovery from Fc-modified colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF1-Fc) treatment was accompanied by an increase in total haematopoietic stem cells. 2) Pre-conditioning with CSF1-Fc increased the reconstitution potential of blood after haematopoietic stem cell mobilisation.",

Customized airway stents with tailorable bioresorbability that can be produced in a reasonable time frame would be highly needed in the management of this disorder.

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWSudden cardiac arrest is a malfunction of the hearts electrical system, typically caused by ventricular arrhythmias, that can lead to sudden cardiac death (SCD) within minutes. Epidemiological studies have shown that SCD and ventricular arrhythmias are more likely to occur in the morning than in the evening, and laboratory studies indicate that these daily rhythms in adverse cardiovascular events are at least partially under the control of the endogenous circadian timekeeping system. However, the biophysical mechanisms linking molecular circadian clocks to cardiac arrhythmogenesis are not fully understood. Recent experiments have shown that L-type calcium channels exhibit circadian rhythms in both expression and function in guinea pig ventricular cardiomyocytes. We developed an electrophysiological model of these cells to simulate the effect of circadian variation in L-type calcium conductance. We found that there is a circadian pattern in the occurrence of early afterdepolarizations (EADs), which are abnormal depolarizations during the repolarization phase of a cardiac action potential that can trigger fatal ventricular arrhythmias. Specifically, the model produces EADs in the morning but not at other times of day. We show that the model exhibits a codimension-2 Takens-Bogdanov bifurcation that serves as an organizing center for different types of EAD dynamics. We also simulated a 2-D spatial version of this model across a circadian cycle. We found that there is a circadian pattern in the breakup of spiral waves, which represents ventricular fibrillation in cardiac tissue. Specifically, the model produces spiral wave breakup in the morning but not in the evening. Our study is the first to propose a link between circadian rhythms and EAD formation and suggests that the efficacy of drugs targeting EAD-mediated arrhythmias may depend on the time of day that they are administered.\n\nSignificance StatementWhy are life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias more likely to occur in the morning than in the evening? The electrical properties of the heart exhibit daily rhythms due to molecular circadian clocks within cardiomyocytes. Our computational model of ventricular myocytes shows that clock-controlled expression of a voltage-gated calcium ion channel leads to early afterdepolarizations (EADs) at certain times of the day. EADs, in which the membrane potential of a cardiomyocyte depolarizes a second time before fully repolarizing, can trigger arrhythmias. To our knowledge, this is the first study linking the circadian clock to EAD formation. Our results suggest that the efficacy of anti-arrhythmic medications targeting this calcium ion channel may depend on the time of day the drug is taken.",

    "abstract": "PurposeMost prostate cancer (PCa) patients treated with androgen receptor (AR)-signaling inhibitors develop therapeutic resistance due to restoration of AR-functionality. Thus, there is a critical need for novel treatment approaches. Here we investigate the theranostic potential of hu5A10, a humanized monoclonal antibody specifically targeting free prostate-specific antigen (KLK3).\n\nExperimental DesignLNCaP-AR xenografts (NSG mice) and KLK3_Hi-Myc transgenic mice were imaged with 89Zr- or treated with 90Y- or 225Ac-labeled hu5A10; biodistribution and subcellular localization were analyzed by gamma-counting, positron emission tomography (PET), autoradiography and microscopy. Therapeutic efficacy of [225Ac]hu5A10 and [90Y]hu5A10 in LNCaP-AR tumors was assessed by tumor volume measurements, time to nadir (TTN), time to progression (TTP), and survival. Pharmacokinetics of [89Zr]hu5A10 in non-human primates (NHP) were determined using PET.\n\nResultsBiodistribution of radiolabeled hu5A10-constructs was comparable in different mouse models. Specific tumor uptake increased over time and correlated with PSA expression. Treatment with [90Y]/[225Ac]hu5A10 effectively reduced tumor burden and prolonged survival (p[&le;]0.0054). Effects of [90Y]hu5A10 were more immediate than [225Ac]hu5A10 (TTN, p<0.0001) but less sustained (TTP, p<0.0001). Complete responses were observed in 7/18 [225Ac]hu5A10 and 1/9 mice [90Y]hu5A10. Pharmacokinetics of [89Zr]hu5A10 were consistent between NHPs and comparable to those in mice. [89Zr]hu5A10-PET visualized the NHP-prostate over the 2-week observation period.\n\nConclusionsWe present a complete preclinical evaluation of radiolabeled hu5A10 in mouse PCa models and NHPs, and establish hu5A10 as a new theranostic agent that allows highly specific and effective downstream targeting of AR in PSA-expressing tissue. Our data support the clinical translation of radiolabeled hu5A10 for treating PCa.",

We previously showed that a single high-dose TCDD exposure (20 {micro}g/kg) decreased plasma insulin levels in both male and female mice in vivo, but effects on glucose homeostasis were sex-dependent. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether prolonged exposure to a physiologically relevant low-dose of TCDD impacts glucose homeostasis and/or the islet phenotype in a sex-dependent manner in either chow-fed or high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice.\n\nMethodsMale and female mice were exposed to 20 ng/kg/d TCDD 2x/week for 12 weeks and simultaneously fed standard chow or a 45% HFD. Glucose homeostasis was assessed by glucose and insulin tolerance tests, and glucose-induced plasma insulin levels were measured in vivo. Histological analysis was performed on pancreas from male and female mice, and islets were isolated from females at 12 weeks for Tempo-Seq(R) analysis.\n\nResultsLow-dose TCDD exposure did not lead to adverse metabolic consequences in chow-fed male or female mice, or in HFD-fed males. However, TCDD accelerated the onset of HFD-induced hyperglycemia and impaired glucose-induced plasma insulin levels in female mice. TCDD caused a modest increase in islet area in males irrespective of diet, but reduced % beta cell area within islets in females. RNAseq analysis of female islets also revealed abnormal changes to endocrine and metabolic pathways in TCDD-exposed HFD-fed females compared chow-fed females.\n\nConclusionsOur data suggest that prolonged low-dose TCDD exposure has minimal effects on glucose homeostasis and islet morphology in chow-fed male and female mice, but promotes maladaptive metabolic responses in HFD-fed females.",

Photosynthetic bacterial biofilm has been used to weave together MoS2 nanosheets into an adherent film grown on interdigitated electrodes. Liquid-phase exfoliation of bulk MoS2 powder was used to obtain MoS2 nanosheets. A synchronous-fluorescence scan revealed the presence of two emission maxima at 682nm and 715nm for the MoS2 suspension. Such maxima with bandgap energy 1.82 and 1.73 eV corresponded to the single and double layer of MoS2. The presence of such single and multi-layered structures was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy, FTIR studies, and electron microscopy. The current-voltage (I-V) studies of such a bio-nano hybrid revealed the emergence of the gated nature of the current flow. This Schottky diode like behavior, reported earlier for Graphene-biofilm junctions, is also observed in this case. Gating voltage depended on the composition of the biofilm. The semiconductor biofilms, when studied using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, revealed characteristic Nyquist and Bode plots, suggesting special circuit-equivalence for each film.

    "abstract": "Naturalistic stimuli, such as movies, activate a substantial portion of the human brain, invoking a response shared across individuals. Encoding models that predict the neural response to a given stimulus can be very useful for studying brain function. However, existing neural encoding models focus on limited aspects of naturalistic stimuli, ignoring the complex and dynamic interactions of modalities in this inherently context-rich paradigm. Using movie watching data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP, N = 158) database, we build group-level models of neural activity that incorporate several inductive biases about information processing in the brain, including hierarchical processing, assimilation over longer timescales and multi-sensory auditory-visual interactions. We demonstrate how incorporating this joint information leads to remarkable prediction performance across large areas of the cortex, well beyond the visual and auditory cortices into multi-sensory sites and frontal cortex. Furthermore, we illustrate that encoding models learn high-level concepts that generalize remarkably well to alternate task-bound paradigms. Taken together, our findings underscore the potential of neural encoding models as a powerful tool for studying brain function in ecologically valid conditions.",

We quantify a fingerprint of healthy dynamics quantifying the richness of the dynamical repertoire at each spatiotemporal scale by computing the entropy of switching activity between whole-brain functional networks. The results show that the optimal relevant spatial scale is around 300 regions and a temporal scale of around 150 milliseconds.

    "abstract": "The claustrum is densely connected to the cortex and participates in brain functions such as attention and sleep. Although some studies have reported the widely divergent organization of claustrum projections, others describe parallel claustrocortical connections to different cortical regions. Therefore, the details underlying how claustrum neurons broadcast information to cortical networks remain incompletely understood. Using multicolor retrograde tracing we determined the density, topography, and co-projection pattern of fourteen claustrocortical pathways, in mice. We spatially registered these pathways to a common coordinate space and found that the claustrocortical system is topographically organized as a series of overlapping spatial modules, continuously distributed across the dorsoventral claustrum axis. The claustrum core projects predominantly to frontal-midline cortical regions, whereas the dorsal and ventral shell project to the cortical motor system and temporal lobe, respectively. Anatomically connected cortical regions receive common input from a subset of claustrum neurons shared by neighboring modules, whereas spatially separated regions of cortex are innervated by different claustrum modules. Therefore, each output module exhibits a unique position within the claustrum and overlaps substantially with other modules projecting to functionally related cortical regions. Claustrum inhibitory cells containing parvalbumin, somatostatin, and neuropeptide Y also show unique topographical distributions, suggesting different output modules are controlled by distinct inhibitory circuit motifs. The topographic organization of excitatory and inhibitory cell types may enable parallel claustrum outputs to independently coordinate distinct cortical networks.",

    "abstract": "Multichannel electrophysiological sensors and stimulators, especially those used for studying the nervous system, are most commonly based on monolithic microelectrode arrays. Such architecture limits the spatial flexibility of individual electrode placement, posing constraints for scaling to a large number of nodes, particularly across non-contiguous locations. We describe the design and fabrication of sub-millimeter size electronic microchips (\"Neurograins\") which autonomously perform neural sensing or electrical microstimulation, with emphasis on their wireless networking and powering. An [~]1 GHz electromagnetic transcutaneous link to an external telecom hub enables bidirectional communication and control at the individual neurograin level. The link operates on a customized time division multiple access (TDMA) protocol designed to scale up to 1000 neurograins. The system is demonstrated as a cortical implant in a small animal (rat) model with anatomical limitations restricting the implant to 48 neurograins. We suggest that the neurograin approach can be generalized to overcome many scalability issues for wireless sensors and actuators as implantable microsystems.",

    "abstract": "DNA repair is essential for preserving genome integrity and ensuring cellular functionality and survival. Podocytes, post-mitotic glomerular epithelial cells, bear limited regenerative capacity, and their survival is indispensable to maintain the function of the kidneys filtration units. While podocyte depletion is a hallmark of the aging process and of many proteinuric kidney diseases, the underlying factors remain unclear.\n\nWe investigated DNA repair in podocyte diseases by using a constitutive and an inducible podocyte-specific knockout mouse model for Ercc1, a multifunctional endonuclease cofactor involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER), interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair, and DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. We assessed the consequences of Ercc1 loss in vivo, complemented by mechanistical in vitro studies of induced DNA damage in cultured podocytes. Furthermore, we characterized DNA damage-related alterations in mouse and human renal tissue of different ages as well as in patient biopsies with minimal change disease and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.\n\nPodocyte-specific Ercc1 knockout resulted in accumulation of DNA damage with ensuing proteinuria, podocyte loss, glomerulosclerosis, renal insufficiency, and reduced lifespan. The response to genomic stress was different to the pattern reported in other cell types, as podocytes activated mTORC1 signaling upon DNA damage in vitro and in vivo. The induced mTORC1 activation was abrogated by inhibiting DNA damage response through DNA-PK and ATM kinases in vitro. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 modulated the development of glomerulosclerosis in Ercc1-deficient mice. Perturbed DNA repair gene expression and genomic stress was also detected in podocytes of human focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, characterized by podocyte loss. Beyond that, DNA damage accumulation occurred in podocytes of healthy aging mice and humans.\n\nThese findings reveal that genome maintenance is crucial for podocyte maintenance, linked to the mTORC1 pathway, and involved in the aging process as well as in the development of glomerulosclerosis, potentially serving as a therapeutic target in the future.",

    "abstract": "Stabilization and activation of the p53 tumour suppressor are triggered in response to various cellular stresses, including DNA damaging agents and elevated Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) like H2O2. When cells are exposed to exogenously added H2O2, ATR/CHK1 and ATM/CHK2 dependent DNA damage signaling is switched on, suggesting that H2O2 induces both single and double strand breaks. These collective observations have resulted in the widely accepted model that oxidizing conditions lead to DNA damage that subsequently mediates a p53-dependent response like cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. However, H2O2 induces signaling through stress-activated kinases (SAPK, e.g., JNK and p38MAPK) that can activate p53. Here we dissect to what extent these pathways contribute to functional activation of p53 in response to oxidizing conditions. Collectively, our data suggest that p53 can be activated both by SAPK signaling and the DDR independently of each other, and which of these pathways is activated depends on the type of oxidant used. This implies that it could in principle be possible to modulate redox signaling to stimulate p53 without inducing collateral DNA damage, thereby limiting mutation accumulation in both healthy and tumor tissues.",

    "abstract": "Approximately half of the human genome is comprised of transposable elements (TEs), which are genetic elements capable of amplifying themselves within the genome. Throughout the course of human life, TEs are expressed in germ cells, the preimplantation embryo, and the placenta but silenced elsewhere. However, the functions of TEs during embryonic development are poorly understood. Trophoblast stem (TS), embryonic stem (ES), and extraembryonic endoderm stem (XEN) cells are cell lineages derived from the preimplantation embryo and known to have different TE silencing mechanisms. Thus, it is likely distinct TEs are expressed in each lineage and that proteins coded by these TEs have lineage-specific functions. The purpose of this research was to determine which TEs are expressed in each of these stem cell lineages and to compare expression levels between lineages. Each lineages transcriptome was analyzed by quantifying TE expression in RNA-sequencing data from mouse stem cells. Expression data were then used for differential expression analyses performed between the cell types. It was found that certain families of TEs are distinctly expressed in certain lineages, suggesting expression of these families may be involved in the differentiation and development of each lineage, the understanding of which can lead to improved stem cell therapies and capacity to study human embryonic development.",

Camera trap arrays have become the  gold standard method for surveying many terrestrial mammals and birds, but these arrays often generate millions of images that are challenging to process. This causes significant latency between data collection and subsequent inference, which can impede conservation at a time of ecological crisis. Machine learning algorithms have been developed to improve camera trap data processing speeds, but these models are not considered accurate enough for fully automated labeling of images.\nC_LIO_LIHere, we present a new approach to building and testing a high performance machine learning model for fully automated labeling of camera trap images. As a case-study, the model classifies 26 Central African forest mammal and bird species (or groups). The model was trained on a relatively small dataset (c.300,000 images) but generalizes to fully independent data and outperforms humans in several respects (e.g. detecting  invisible animals). We show how the models precision and accuracy can be evaluated in an ecological modeling context by comparing species richness, activity patterns (n = 4 species tested) and occupancy (n = 4 species tested) derived from machine learning labels with the same estimates derived from expert labels.\nC_LIO_LIResults show that fully automated labels can be equivalent to expert labels when calculating species richness, activity patterns (n = 4 species tested) and estimating occupancy (n = 3 of 4 species tested) in completely out-of-sample test data (n = 227 camera stations, n = 23868 images). Simple thresholding (discarding uncertain labels) improved the models performance when calculating activity patterns and estimating occupancy, but did not improve estimates of species richness.\nC_LIO_LIWe provide the user-community with a multi-platform, multi-language user interface for running the model offline, and conclude that high performance machine learning models can fully automate labeling of camera trap data.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInter-individual variation in voluntary ethanol consumption and ethanol response is partially influenced by genetic variation. Discovery of the genes and allelic variants that affect these phenotypes may clarify the etiology and pathophysiology of problematic alcohol use, including alcohol use disorder. Genetically diverse mouse populations also demonstrate heritable variation in ethanol consumption and can be utilized to discover the genes and gene networks that influence this trait. The Collaborative Cross (CC) recombinant inbred strains, Diversity Outbred (DO) population and their eight founder strains are complementary mouse resources that capture substantial genetic diversity and can demonstrate expansive phenotypic variation in heritable traits. These populations may be utilized to discover candidate genes and gene networks that moderate ethanol consumption and other ethanol-related traits.\n\nMethodsWe characterized ethanol consumption, preference and pharmacokinetics in the eight founder strains and ten CC strains in 12-hour drinking sessions during the dark phase of the circadian cycle.\n\nResultsEthanol consumption was found to be substantially heritable, both early in ethanol access and over a chronic intermittent access schedule. Ethanol pharmacokinetics were also found to be heritable; however, no association between strain-level ethanol consumption and pharmacokinetics was detected. The PWK/PhJ strain was found to be the highest drinking strain, with consumption substantially exceeding C57BL/6J, a strain commonly used as a model of \"high\" or \"binge\" drinking. Notably, we found strong evidence that sex moderated genetic effects on voluntary ethanol drinking.\n\nConclusionsCollectively, this research may serve as a foundation for expanded genetic study of ethanol consumption in the CC/DO and related populations; moreover, we have identified reference strains with extreme consumption phenotypes that effectively represent polygenic models of hazardous ethanol use.",

Here, we define how commensal Escherichia coli (E. coli) alters its host after long term exposure to glucose using a C. elegans-E. coli system. Our data reveal that bacterial processing of glucose, rather than direct ingestion by the animal, results in reduced lifespan and healthspan, including reduced locomotion, oxidative stress resistance, and heat stress resistance in C. elegans. Chronic exposure of E. coli to glucose produces growth defects and increased advanced glycation end products within the E. coli. These negative effects are abrogated when the E. coli is not able to process the additional glucose and by the addition of the anti-glycation compound carnosine. Physiological changes of the host C. elegans are accompanied by dysregulation of detoxifying genes including glyoxalase, glutathione-S-transferase, and superoxide dismutase. Loss of gst-4 shortens C. elegans lifespan and blunts the animals response to a glucose-fed bacteria diet. Taken together, we reveal that added dietary sugar may alter intestinal microbial E. coli to decrease lifespan and healthspan of the host and define the critical role of detoxification genes in maintaining health during a chronic high-sugar diet.",

    "abstract": "Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are frequently driven by insertions and deletions within the gene encoding calreticulin (CRT). CRTDel52 and CRTIns5 are recurrent mutations. Although oncogenic transformation requires both mutated CRT and the myeloproliferative leukemia protein (Mpl), the molecular mechanism of CRT-mediated constitutive activation of Mpl is unknown. Our studies reveal that the novel C-domain of CRTDel52 encodes specificity both for Mpl binding and for disulfide-mediated CRT dimerization. Disulfide-stabilized CRTDel52 dimers and multimers are observed in MPN patient-derived platelet lysates and in transfected mammalian cells. Cysteine mutations within both the novel C-domain (C400A and C404A) and the conserved N-domain (C163A) of CRTDel52 are required to reduce disulfide-mediated dimers and multimers of CRTDel52. Based on these data and published structures of crystalized CRT oligomers, we tested the relevance of ionic interactions between charged residues proximal to C163 at the N-domain dimerization interface. Charge alteration at these residues affected dimerization and multimerization of both wild type and CRTDel52. Elimination of intermolecular disulfides and disruption of ionic interactions at both proposed dimerization interfaces was required to abrogate the ability of CRTDel52 to induce cytokine-independent cell proliferation via Mpl. Based on these findings, we propose a structural model of the Mpl-activating CRTDel52 unit as a covalently-linked dimer that is stabilized by disulfides and ionic interactions at both the C-domain and N-domain. MPNs exploit a natural dimerization interface of CRT combined with C-domain gain-of-functions to achieve cell transformation.",

    "abstract": "Tumors frequently exhibit aberrant glycosylation, which can impact cancer progression and therapeutic responses. The hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) produces uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), a major substrate for glycosylation in the cell. Prior studies have identified the HBP as a promising therapeutic target in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). The HBP requires both glucose and glutamine for its initiation. The PDA tumor microenvironment is nutrient poor, however, prompting us to investigate how nutrient limitation impacts hexosamine synthesis. Here, we identify that glutamine limitation in PDA cells suppresses de novo hexosamine synthesis but results in increased free GlcNAc abundance. GlcNAc salvage via N-acetylglucosamine kinase (NAGK) is engaged to feed UDP-GlcNAc pools. NAGK expression is elevated in human PDA, and NAGK deletion from PDA cells impairs tumor growth in mice. Together, these data identify an important role for NAGK-dependent hexosamine salvage in supporting PDA tumor growth.",

    "abstract": "Background and AimsHepatoblastoma (HB), the most common pediatric liver cancer, often bears {beta}-catenin mutations and deregulates the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway. Murine HBs can be generated by co-expressing {beta}-catenin mutants and the constitutively active Hippo effector YAPS127A. Some HBs and other cancers also express mutants of NFE2L2/NRF2 (NFE2L2), a transcription factor that tempers oxidative and electrophilic stress. In doing so, NFE2L2 either suppresses or facilitates tumorigenesis.\n\nMethodsWe evaluated NFE2L2s role in HB pathogenesis by co-expressing all combinations of mutant {beta}-catenin, YAPS127A and the patient-derived NFE2L2 mutants L30P and R34P in murine livers. We evaluated growth, biochemical and metabolic profiles and transcriptomes of the ensuing tumors.\n\nResultsIn association with {beta}-catenin+YAPS127A, L30P and R34P markedly accelerated HB growth and generated widespread cyst formation and necrosis, which are otherwise uncommon features. Surprisingly, any two members of the mutant {beta}-catenin-YAPS127A-L30P/R34P triad were tumorigenic, thus directly establishing NFE2L2s oncogenicity. Each tumor group displayed distinct features but shared 22 similarly deregulated transcripts, 10 of which perfectly correlated with survival in human HBs and 17 of which correlated with survival in multiple adult cancers. One highly up-regulated transcript encoded serpin E1, a serine protease inhibitor that regulates fibrinolysis, growth and extracellular matrix. The combination of mutant {beta}-catenin, YAPS127A and Serpin E1, while not accelerating cystogenic tumor growth, did promote the wide-spread necrosis associated with mutant {beta}-catenin-YAPS127A-L30P/R34P tumors.\n\nConclusionsOur findings establish the direct oncogenicity of NFE2L2 mutants and key transcripts, including serpin E1, that drive specific HB features.",

    "abstract": "{beta}-catenin ({beta}cat) is an important downstream effector in the Wnt signaling pathway and plays an important role in the development and progression of many cancers including melanoma. {beta}cat expression is regulated by GSK-3{beta}-mediated phosphorylation at positions 33, 37 and 41. In normal cells, phosphorylation at these sites triggers proteasomal degradation, which in turn prevents accumulation of free cytoplasmic {beta}cat. In cancer cells, stabilized {beta}-catenin translocates into the nucleus, where it associates with TCF/Lef proteins to activate transcription of genes that promote tumorigenesis and metastasis. It has been suggested that nuclear phospho-{beta}cat (p{beta}cat) staining may be diagnostically useful in differentiating primary from metastatic melanoma. Also, a p{beta}cat peptide (residues 30-39, p33) is naturally presented by melanoma cells as a T-cell target. We evaluated the expression of pS33-{beta}cat in primary and metastatic melanoma tissues by immunohistochemistry. pS33-{beta}cat was detected in primary and metastatic melanomas and was most commonly cytoplasmic and almost never exclusively nuclear. Interestingly, staining with pS33-{beta}cat and pS33/37/T41-{beta}cat antibodies was most intense in mitotic melanoma cells, consistent with prior studies demonstrating changes in the level of {beta}cat during cell division. We observed no significant differences in p{beta}cat staining location or intensity between primary and metastatic melanomas, suggesting that p{beta}cat may have limited diagnostic or prognostic utility in melanoma.

Little is known about their functions in other developmental responses. A tomato Non-phototropic seedling1 (Nps1) mutant, bearing an Arg495His substitution in the vicinity of LOV2 domain in phototropin1, dominant-negatively blocks phot1 and phot2 responses. The fruits of Nps1 mutant were enriched in carotenoids, particularly lycopene, than its parent, Ailsa Craig. Contrarily, CRISPR/CAS9-edited loss of function phototropin1 mutants displayed subdued carotenoids than the parent. The enrichment of carotenoids in Nps1 fruits is genetically linked with the mutation and exerted in a dominant-negative fashion. Nps1 also altered volatile profiles with high levels of lycopene-derived 6-methyl 5-hepten2-one. The transcript levels of several MEP and carotenogenesis pathways genes were upregulated in Nps1. Nps1 fruits showed altered hormonal profiles with subdued ethylene emission and reduced respiration. Proteome profiles showed a causal link between higher carotenogenesis and increased levels of protein protection machinery, which may stabilize proteins contributing to MEP and carotenogenesis pathways.

    "abstract": "PurposeTo propose an efficient retrospective image-based method for motion correction of multi-contrast acquisitions with a low number of available images (MC-MoCo) and evaluate its use in 3D inhomogeneous Magnetization Transfer (ihMT) experiments in the human brain.\n\nMethodsA framework for motion correction, including image pre-processing enhancement and rigid registration to an iteratively improved target image, was developed. The proposed method was compared to Motion Correction with FMRIBs Linear Image Registration Tool (MCFLIRT) function in FSL over 13 subjects. Native (pre-correction) and residual (post-correction) motions were evaluated by means of markers positioned at well-defined anatomical regions over each image.\n\nResultsBoth motion correction strategies significantly reduced inter-image misalignment, and the MC-MoCo method yielded significantly better results than MCFLIRT.\n\nConclusionMC-MoCo is a high-performance method for motion correction of multi-contrast volumes as in 3D ihMT imaging.",
