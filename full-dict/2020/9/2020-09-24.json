    "abstract": "Pathological oscillations including elevated beta activity in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and between STN and cortical areas are a hallmark of neural activity in Parkinsons disease (PD). Oscillations also play an important role in normal physiological processes and serve distinct functional roles at different points in time. We characterised the effect of dopaminergic medication on oscillatory whole-brain networks in PD in a time-resolved manner by employing a hidden Markov model on combined STN local field potentials and magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings from 17 PD patients. Dopaminergic medication led to coherence within the medial and orbitofrontal cortex in the delta/theta frequency range. This is in line with known side effects of dopamine treatment such as deteriorated executive functions in Parkinsons disease. In addition, dopamine caused the beta band activity to switch from an STN-mediated motor network to a frontoparietal-mediated one. In contrast, dopamine did not modify local STN-STN coherence in PD. STN-STN synchrony emerged both on and off medication. By providing electrophysiological evidence for the differential effects of dopaminergic medication on the discovered networks, our findings open further avenues for electrical and pharmacological interventions in PD.",

    "abstract": "Learning of new auditory stimuli requires repetitive exposure to the stimulus. Fast and implicit learning of sounds presented at random times enables efficient auditory perception. However, it is unclear how such sensory encoding is processed on a neural level. We investigated neural responses that are developed from a passive, repetitive exposure to a specific sound in the auditory cortex of anesthetized rats, using electrocorticography. We presented a series of random sequences that are generated afresh each time, except for a specific reference sequence that remains constant and re-appears at random times across trials. We compared induced activity amplitudes between reference and fresh sequences. Neural responses from both primary and non-primary auditory cortical regions showed significantly decreased induced activity amplitudes for reference sequences compared to fresh sequences, especially in the beta band. This is the first study showing that neural correlates of auditory pattern learning can be evoked even in anesthetized, passive listening animal models.",

Immunization of S-Trimer with either AS03 (oil-in-water emulsion) or CpG 1018 (TLR9 agonist) plus alum adjuvants induced high-levels of neutralizing antibodies and Th1-biased cellular immune responses in animal models. Moreover, rhesus macaques immunized with adjuvanted S-Trimer were protected from SARS-CoV-2 challenge compared to vehicle controls, based on clinical observations and reduction of viral loads in lungs.

The use of appropriate experimental animal models remains central in the in-vivo exploration of the physiopathology of infection and antiviral strategies. This study describes SARS-CoV-2 intra-nasal infection in ferrets and hamsters with low doses of low-passage SARS-CoV-2 clinical French isolate UCN19, describing infection levels, excretion, immune responses and pathological patterns in both animal species. Individual infection with 103 pfu SARS-CoV-2 induced a more severe disease in hamsters than in ferrets. Viral RNA was detected in the lungs of hamsters but not of ferrets and in the brain (olfactive and/or spinal bulbs) of both species. Overall, the clinical disease remained mild, with serological responses detected from 7 days and 10 days post inoculation in hamsters and ferrets respectively. Virus became undetectable and pathology resolved within 14 days. The kinetics and levels of infection can be used in ferrets and hamsters as experimental models for understanding the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2, and testing the protective effect of drugs.",

    "abstract": "The current COVID-19 pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has an enormous impact on human health and economy. In search for therapeutic options, researchers have proposed resveratrol, a food supplement with known antiviral, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties as an advantageous antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we provide evidence that both resveratrol and its metabolically more stable structural analog, pterostilbene, exhibit potent antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Resveratrol and pterostilbene showed antiviral activity in African green monkey kidney cells and in human primary bronchial epithelial cells cultured in an air-liquid interface system. Both compounds actively inhibit virus replication within infected cells as reduced virus progeny production was observed when the compound was added at post-inoculation conditions. Without replenishment of the compound, antiviral activity was observed up to roughly 5 rounds of replication, demonstrating the long-lasting effect of these compounds. Collectively, our data indicate that resveratrol and pterostilbene are promising antiviral compounds to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because these results represent laboratory findings in cells, we advocate evaluation of these compounds in clinical trials before statements are made whether or not these drugs are advantageous for COVID-19 treatment.",

    "abstract": "We report the likely most recent common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 - the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. This progenitor SARS-CoV-2 genome was recovered through a novel application and advancement of computational methods initially developed to reconstruct the mutational history of tumor cells in a patient. The progenitor differs from the earliest coronaviruses sampled in China by three variants, implying that none of the earliest patients represent the index case or gave rise to all the human infections. However, multiple coronavirus infections in China and the USA harbored the progenitor genetic fingerprint in January 2020 and later, suggesting that the progenitor was spreading worldwide as soon as weeks after the first reported cases of COVID-19. Mutations of the progenitor and its offshoots have produced many dominant coronavirus strains, which have spread episodically over time. Fingerprinting based on common mutations reveals that the same coronavirus lineage has dominated North America for most of the pandemic. There have been multiple replacements of predominant coronavirus strains in Europe and Asia and the continued presence of multiple high-frequency strains in Asia and North America. We provide a continually updating dashboard of global evolution and spatiotemporal trends of SARS-CoV-2 spread (http://sars2evo.datamonkey.org/).",

    "abstract": "The billion tons of synthetic polymer-based materials (i.e. plastics) produced every year are one of the greatest challenges that humanity has to face. Nature produces even more natural polymers, yet they are sustainable. For example, proteins are sequence-defined natural polymers, that are constantly recycled when living systems feed. Indeed, digestion is the protein depolymerization into amino acids (i.e. the monomers) followed by their re-assembly into new proteins of arbitrarily different sequence and function. This process breaks a common recycling paradigm where a material is recycled into itself. Organisms feed of random protein mixtures that are  recycled into new proteins whose identity depends on the cells needs at the time of protein synthesis. Currently, advanced materials are increasingly made of proteins, but the abovementioned ideal recyclability of such materials has yet to be recognized and established. In this study mixtures of several (up to >30) peptides and/or proteins were depolymerized into their amino acid constituents, and these amino acids were used to synthesize new fluorescent, and bio-active proteins extra-cellularly by using an amino acid-free cell-free transcription-translation system. Proteins with high relevance in materials engineering ({beta}-lactoglobulin films, used for water filtration, or silk fibroin solutions) were successfully recycled into biotechnologically relevant proteins (green, and red fluorescent proteins, catechol 2,3-dioxygenase). The potential long-term impact of this approach to recycling lies in its compatibility with circular-economy models where raw materials remain in use as long as possible, thus reducing the burden on the planet.",

The analysis of large numbers of samples at high sequencing depths generated by high throughput sequencing technologies requires effcient, flexible, and reproducible bioinformatics pipelines. Only a few existing workflows can be run in a user-friendly, scalable, and reproducible manner on different computing devices using an effcient workflow management system. We present Natrix, an open-source bioinformatics workflow for preprocessing raw amplicon sequencing data. The workflow contains all analysis steps from quality assessment, read assembly, dereplication, chimera detection, split-sample merging, sequence representative assignment (OTUs or ASVs) to the taxonomic assignment of sequence representatives. The workflow is written using Snakemake, a workflow management engine for developing data analysis workflows. In addition, Conda is used for version control. Thus, Snakemake ensures reproducibility and Conda offers version control of the utilized programs. The encapsulation of rules and their dependencies support hassle-free sharing of rules between workflows and easy adaptation and extension of existing workflows.

Thus, it is reasonable to assume that there might be a type of \"bookmark\" that retains the positions of histone modifications, which can be readily restored after mitosis. We developed a novel computational approach comprising tensor decomposition (TD)-based unsupervised feature extraction (FE) to identify transcription factors (TFs) that bind to genes associated with reactivated histone modifications as candidate histone bookmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of TD-based unsupervised FE to the cell division context and phases pertaining to the cell cycle in general. The candidate TFs identified with this approach were functionally related to cell division, suggesting the suitability of this method and the potential of the identified TFs as bookmarks for histone modification during mitosis.",

    "abstract": "Throughout the process of metastatic dissemination, tumor cells are continuously subjected to mechanical forces resulting from complex fluid flows due to changes in pressures in their local microenvironments. While these forces have been associated with invasive phenotypes in 3D matrices, their role in key steps of the metastatic cascade, namely extravasation and subsequent interstitial migration, remains poorly understood. In this study, an in vitro model of the human microvasculature was employed to subject tumor cells to physiological luminal, trans-endothelial, and interstitial flows to evaluate their effects on those key steps of metastasis. Luminal flow promoted the extravasation potential of tumor cells, possibly as a result of their increased intravascular migration speed. Trans-endothelial flow increased the speed with which tumor cells transmigrated across the endothelium as well as their migration speed in the matrix following extravasation. In addition, tumor cells possessed a greater propensity to migrate in close proximity to the endothelium when subjected to physiological flows, which may promote the successful formation of metastatic foci. These results show important roles of fluid flow during extravasation and invasion, which could determine the local metastatic potential of tumor cells.",

The difficulty derives from the fact that variable environment has significant effect on DNA preservation. During the years 2002-2015 unidentified degraded skeletal remains were accumulated at our institute, National Institute of Forensic Medicine (NIFM), most of them with none or partial DNA profile.\n\nAs new methods rapidly emerge, we revisited the samples with partial DNA profiles. We have chosen to use these samples to compare two automated methods: Prepfiler Express BTA (Applied Biosystems) and QIAcube (Quiagen), in hope of acquiring a more complete DNA profile and eventually even make new identifications. In both methods a preparation step is required, after which the samples undergo automatic DNA extraction.\n\nThe two protocols are based on different extraction methods. Fresh or non-problematic bone samples as the positive control gave the same results in both methods. In the degraded skeletal samples, the results were significantly better using the QIAcube method.",

    "abstract": "Hirschsprungs disease (HSCR) is a congenital disorder characterized by the absence of enteric neural crest cells (ENCCs). Non-coding RNAs including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) have been authenticated as important regulators of biological functions. We conducted a microarray analysis and found lncRNA Rhabdomyosarcoma 2-associated transcript (RMST) was down-regulated in the stenotic segment of HSCR patients. MiR-1251 is transcribed from the intron region of RMST and was also low-expressed. When the expression of RMST or miR-1251 was reduced, the cell proliferation and migration were attenuated. However, RMST didnt affect the expression of miR-1251 directly found in this study. Through bioinformatic analysis, transcription factor SOX2 was predicted to bind to the promoter region of miR-1251 which was confirmed by CHIP assay. Herein, we demonstrated that RMST exerted as a co-regulator of SOX2 to regulate the expression of miR-1251. Furtherly, AHNAK was proved to be the target gene of miR-1251 in this study. Taken together, we revealed the role of RMST/SOX2/miR-1251/AHNAK pathway in the occurrence of Hirschsprungs disease and provided a potential therapeutic target for this disease.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTHirschsprung disease (HSCR) is characterized by a deficit in enteric neurons, however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear.

    "abstract": "Schwann cells are the principal glial cells of the peripheral nervous system, and their development into myelinating glia is critically dependent on MEK/ERK signaling. Ets-domain transcription factors (Etv1, Etv4, Etv5) are common downstream effectors of MEK/ERK signalling, but so far, only Etv1 has been ascribed a role in Schwann cell development, and only in non-myelinating cells. Here, we examined the role of Etv5, which is expressed in Schwann cell precursors, including neural crest cells and satellite glia, in Schwann cell lineage development. We analysed Etv5tm1Kmm mutants (designated Etv5-/-) at embryonic days (E) 12.5, E15.5 and E18.5, focusing on dorsal root ganglia. At these embryonic stages, satellite glia (glutamine synthetase) and Schwann cell markers, including transcriptional regulators (Sox10, Sox9, Tfap2a, Pou3f1) and non-transcription factors (Ngfr, BFABP, GFAP), were expressed in the DRG of wild-type and Etv5-/- embryos. Furthermore, by E18.5, quantification of Sox10+ Schwann cells and NeuN+ neurons revealed that these cells were present in normal numbers in the Etv5-/- dorsal root ganglia. We next performed peripheral nerve injuries at postnatal day 21, revealing that Etv5-/- mice had an enhanced injury response, generating more Sox10+ Schwann cells compared to wild-type animals at five days post-injury. Thus, while Etv5 is not required for Schwann cell development, possibly due to genetic redundancy with Etv1 and/or Etv4, Etv5 is an essential negative regulator of the peripheral nerve injury repair response.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTOur study sought to determine whether the ets domain transcription factor, Etv5, plays a role in regulating Schwann cell development and nerve repair. By using an embryonically and postnatally viable hypomorphic Etv5 mutant allele, we demonstrated that Etv5 is not required for the development of Schwann cells or other neural crest derivatives in the dorsal root ganglia, including satellite glia and neurons. Surprisingly, loss of Etv5 had a direct impact on the Schwann cell repair response post-injury, resulting in more Schwann cells populating the distal injured nerve site compared to wild-type animals. Thus, this work describes for the first time a role for Etv5 in regulating the Schwann cell repair response after peripheral nerve injury.",

    "abstract": "Mitogen-activated protein kinase 6 (MAPK6) is an atypical MAPK closely related to MAPK4. We recently reported that MAPK4 can promote cancer by activating the Protein Kinase B (PKB/AKT) pathway of cell growth and survival. Here we report that MAPK6 overexpression also activates AKT to induce oncogenic outcomes, including transforming \"normal\" human epithelial cells into anchorage-independent growth and enhancing cancer cell growth. Knockdown of MAPK6 inhibited cancer cell growth and xenograft growth, supporting the tumor-promoting activities of endogenous MAPK6. Unlike MAPK4, which binds AKT through its kinase domain and phosphorylates AKT at T308, MAPK6 interacts with AKT through its C34 region and the unique C-terminal tail and phosphorylates AKT at S473 independent of mTORC2, the major AKT S473 kinase. MAPK6 overexpression is associated with decreased overall survival and the survival of lung adenocarcinoma, mesothelioma, uveal melanoma, and breast cancer patients. We conclude that MAPK6 can promote cancer by activating AKT and that targeting MAPK6 may be effective in human cancers.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that induction of lethal autophagy carries potential significance for the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM). In continuation of previous work, we demonstrate that pimozide and loperamide trigger an ATG5- and ATG7-dependent type of cell death that is significantly inhibited with the cathepsin inhibitors E64D/Pepstatin A and the lipid ROS scavenger -tocopherol in MZ-54 GBM cells. Global proteomic analysis after treatment with both drugs also revealed an increase of proteins related to lipid and cholesterol metabolic processes. These changes were accompanied by AKT1 (AKT serine/threonine kinase 1) inhibition and a massive accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids in the lysosomal compartment, indicative of impaired lipid transport/degradation. In line with these observations, pimozide and loperamide treatment were associated with a pronounced increase of bioactive sphingolipids including ceramides, glucosylceramides and sphingoid bases measured by targeted lipidomic analysis. Furthermore, pimozide and loperamide inhibited the activity of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM), increased lipid-ROS levels and promoted induction of lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), as well as release of cathepsin B into the cytosol in MZ-54 wt cells. While LMP and cell death were significantly attenuated in ATG5/7 KO cells, both events were enhanced by depletion of the lysophagy receptor VCP (valosin containing protein), supporting a pro-survival function of lysophagy under these conditions. Collectively, our data suggest that pimozide and loperamide-driven autophagy and lipotoxicity synergize to induce LMP and lysosomal cell death. The results also support the notion that simultaneous overactivation of autophagy and induction of LMP represents a promising approach for the treatment of GBM.",

We investigated factors associated with chronic pain in truck drivers including mental health, physical activity, and sleep, as no study has done so.\n\nMethodsSouthern African truck drivers were recruited at truck stops in Gauteng and Free State Provinces, South Africa (n=614). Chronic pain was defined as pain present for at least the last three months. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, post-traumatic stress disorder with the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), exposure to traumatic events with the Life Events Checklist-5 (LEC-5) and daytime sleepiness with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Sleep quality was measured on a four-point Likert scale. Leisure-time physical activity was measured using the Godin-Shephard leisure-time physical activity questionnaire. Associations between these factors, demographic factors and chronic pain were investigated.\n\nResultsSix hundred and fourteen male truck drivers were recruited. Multivariate analysis showed that working [&ge;] 2 nights/week (OR=2.68, 95% CI=1.55-4.68) was associated with chronic pain and physical activity was protective (OR=0.97, 95% CI 0.95-0.98). In an exploratory analysis, greater depressive symptoms (p=0.004), daytime sleepiness (p=0.01) and worse sleep quality (p=0.001) was associated with working [&ge;] 2 nights/week. Lower leisure-time physical activity was associated with worse sleep quality (p=0.006), but not daytime sleepiness or depressive symptoms (p>0.05).\n\nConclusionsThere is a clear relationship between working nights and activity levels, and chronic pain, sleep quality, and depression in truck drivers.",

In this study, we identified ATP synthase inhibitory factor 1 (ATPIF1) as a potential target in the induction of CD8+ T cell immunity against tumor. Inactivation of ATPIF1 gene in mice promoted the antitumor activity of CD8+ T cells leading to suppression of tumor growth of B16 melanoma and Lewis lung cancer. The phenotype was abolished by deletion of CD8+ T cells in the ATPIF1-KO mice. The tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells exhibited strong activities in the proliferation, effector and memory as revealed by the single cell RNA sequencing results of CD45+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) isolated from the tumors. The CD8+ T cells expressed more antitumor makers in the tumor microenvironment and in coculture with the tumor cells. The cells had a higher level of glycolysis after the T cell receptor-mediated activation as revealed by the targeted metabolomics assay. The cells exhibited an extra activity of oxidative phosphorylation before the activation as indicated by the oxygen consumption rate. The cells gained capacities in the proliferation, apoptosis resistance and mitophagy in the glucose-limiting environment. These data suggest that inhibition of ATPIF1 activity by gene inactivation rewired the energy metabolism of CD8+ T cells to enhance their immune activities to the tumors.

    "abstract": "The four dengue virus serotypes (DENV1-4) infect several hundred million people each year living in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Clinical development of DENV vaccines is difficult because immunity to a single serotype increases risk of severe disease during a second infection with a new serotype. Leading vaccines are based on tetravalent formulations to induce simultaneous and balanced protective immunity to all 4 serotypes. TAK-003 is a tetravalent live attenuated dengue vaccine candidate developed by Takeda Vaccines Inc, which is currently being evaluated in phase 3 efficacy trials. Here, we use antibody depletion methods and chimeric, epitope transplant DENVs to characterize the specificity of neutralizing antibodies in dengue-naive adults and non-human primates immunized with TAK-003. Our results demonstrate that TAK-003 induced high levels of DENV2 neutralizing antibodies that recognized unique (type-specific) epitopes on DENV2. In contrast, most vaccinated subjects developed lower levels of DENV1, DENV3 and DENV4 neutralizing antibodies that mainly targeted epitopes that were conserved (cross-reactive) between serotypes. We conclude that the DENV2 component in the vaccine is immunodominant because of the high levels of serum neutralizing antibodies targeting type-specific epitopes. We also conclude that DENV1, 3 and 4 vaccine components are less immunogenic because most study subjects did not develop type-specific serum neutralizing antibodies to these serotypes. While DENV vaccine development has been guided by the presence of neutralizing antibodies to each serotype as a benchmark, our results indicate that the presence of neutralizing antibodies alone are not a reliable indicator of the immunogenicity of each vaccine component.\n\nAuthor summaryThe development of tetravalent dengue vaccines has been guided by neutralizing antibodies to each serotype as a correlate of safe and effective vaccine induced immunity. However, the absolute levels of neutralizing antibodies to each serotype has proven to be an unreliable correlate of protection. Levels of antibodies to epitopes that are unique to each serotype, which are measures of immunity independently stimulated by each vaccine component, rather than total quantity of neutralizing antibodies, are likely to be better correlates of protection. Here, we mapped the specificity of antibodies induced by the Takeda tetravalent dengue vaccine TAK-003 in monkeys and humans with no prior immunity to dengue. The TAK-003 vaccine induces high levels of serotype 2 specific neutralizing antibodies that map to known protective epitopes. In contrast, the serotype 1, 3 and 4 neutralizing antibody responses are lower and mainly consist of cross-reactive antibodies binding to epitopes conserved between serotypes. These heterotypic antibodies, which are most likely derived from the serotype 2 component, may not provide long term protection in vivo.",

    "abstract": "The Atacama Desert, the driest and oldest desert in the world, is a hostile environment for life. Despite the inhospitable conditions, bacterial sequences detected in this location suggest rich bacterial life. This study tested the idea that certain bacteria would thrive in this location and that some of them could be cultivated permitting further characterization. Environmental surface soil samples from 1-5 cm deep were collected from 18 diverse locations within the Atacama Desert. To assess the bacterial taxa, diversity, and abundance, Illumina 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed directly on soil samples. Bacteria were also cultured from the samples. We have a collection of 74 unique bacterial isolates after cultivation and confirmation by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Pigmentation, biofilm formation, antibiotic production against Escherichia coli MG1655 and Staphylococcus aureus HG003, and antibiotic resistance were assessed on these isolates. We found that approximately a third of the colonies produced pigments, 80% of isolates formed biofilms, many isolates had antibiotic activity against E. coli and/or S. aureus, and many were resistant to commercial antibiotics. The functional characterization of these isolates gives us insight into the adaptive bacterial strategies in harsh environments and enables us to learn about their possible use in agriculture, healthcare, or biotechnology.\n\nOriginality-Significant StatementThis study provides the first microbial diversity analysis from Atacama Desert soil, presents the cultivation and isolation of 74 unique bacterial isolates, many of which may be novel genera and species, and explores pigment production, antibiotic production and resistance, and unique biofilm development as bacterial survival strategies for living within extreme environments.",

    "abstract": "Biotic and abiotic factors of wine fermentations have led to the accumulation of numerous genomic hallmarks of domestication in Saccharomyces cerevisiae wine strains. Here we have studied the paradoxical distribution of a dominant allele of IRC7 in wine yeast strains. This gene encodes a cysteine-S-{beta}-lyase and presents two alleles: a wild full-length allele (IRC7F) and a mutated one (IRC7S), harboring a 38bp-deletion. Interestingly, IRC7S-coding for a less active enzyme-appears in the great majority of wine strains. Studying its global distribution among phylogenetic clades, we observed that IRC7S allele is dominant just in wine strains, having a moderate presence in other domesticated clades (Beer, Bread and Wine-PDM), but being completely absent in wild clades, appearing as a new hallmark of domestication. To explain this paradoxical distribution, we performed an IRC7-rooted phenotypic-wide survey, demonstrating that IRC7S-homozygous (HS) wine strains have both fitness (lower lag phases and higher growth rates) and competitive (killer toxin resistance, pseudohyphal growth) advantages. Hence, we performed a genome-wide survey across domesticated clades, finding a set of mutations that are conserved among wine strains and potentially associated to IRC7S allele, which can help to explain the outstanding phenotype of HS strains and their dominant distribution in wines.\n\nOriginality-Significance StatementS. cerevisiae is one of the best studied microbes due to its industrial importance and its use as a eukaryotic model organism. S. cerevisiae is also an interesting model for studying the effects of domestication in yeast genomic, phenotype and ecology. The study of how wild S. cerevisiae strains evolved into a greatly adapted domesticated strains and changed its lifestyle drastically is still of great interest. In the case of wine populations, strains have accumulated numerous hallmarks of domestication in their genome, related with their great phenotypic adaptation to this environment. Here, we report a new hallmark of domestication in wine strains; the IRC7 deleted allele (IRC7S) and present the first insights about its unexpected global distribution among phylogenetic clades, understanding the genomic context and the phenotypic implications of this allele in wine strains.",

Here, we show that expression of the human homologue of the neonatal Fc receptor (hFcRn), the primary receptor for echoviruses, and ablation of type I interferon (IFN) signaling are key host determinants involved in echovirus pathogenesis. We show that expression of hFcRn alone is insufficient to confer susceptibility to echovirus infections in mice. However, expression of hFcRn in mice deficient in type I interferon (IFN) signaling, hFcRn-IFNAR-/-, recapitulate the echovirus pathogenesis observed in humans. Luminex-based multianalyte profiling from E11 infected hFcRn-IFNAR-/- mice revealed a robust systemic immune response to infection, including the induction of type I IFNs. Furthermore, similar to the severe hepatitis observed in humans, E11 infection in hFcRn-IFNAR-/- mice caused profound liver damage.

This approach correctly identified the distinct viral entry factors ACE2 (for SARS-CoV-2), aminopeptidase N (for 229E) and glycosaminoglycans (for OC43). Additionally, we discovered phosphatidylinositol phosphate biosynthesis and cholesterol homeostasis as critical host pathways supporting infection by all three coronaviruses. By contrast, the lysosomal protein TMEM106B appeared unique to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pharmacological inhibition of phosphatidylinositol phosphate biosynthesis and cholesterol homeostasis reduced replication of all three coronaviruses.

    "abstract": "Identification of the metastatic potential represents one of the most important tasks for molecular imaging of cancer. While molecular imaging of metastases has witnessed substantial progress as an area of clinical inquiry, determining precisely what differentiates the metastatic phenotype has proven to be more elusive underscoring the need to marry emerging imaging techniques with tumor biology. In this study, we utilize both the morphological and molecular information provided by 3D optical diffraction tomography and Raman spectroscopy, respectively, to propose a label-free route for optical phenotyping of cancer cells at single-cell resolution. By using an isogenic panel of cell lines derived from MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells that vary in their metastatic potential, we show that 3D refractive index tomograms can capture subtle morphological differences among the parental, circulating tumor cells, and lung metastatic cells. By leveraging the molecular specificity of Raman spectroscopy, we demonstrate that coarse Raman microscopy is capable of rapidly mapping a sufficient number of cells for training a random forest classifier that can accurately predict the metastatic potential of cells at a single-cell level. We also leverage multivariate curve resolution - alternating least squares decomposition of the spectral dataset to demarcate spectra from cytoplasm and nucleus, and test the feasibility of identifying metastatic phenotypes using the spectra only from the cytoplasmic and nuclear regions. Overall, our study provides a rationale for employing coarse Raman mapping to substantially reduce measurement time thereby enabling the acquisition of reasonably large training datasets that hold the key for label-free single-cell analysis and, consequently, for differentiation of indolent from aggressive phenotypes.",

In holothurians or sea cucumbers, cellular processes of intestinal regeneration have been extensively studied. The molecular machinery behind this faculty, however, remains to be understood. Here we assembled and annotated a de novo transcriptome using RNA-seq data consisting of regenerating and non-regenerating intestinal tissues from the sea cucumber Holothuria glaberrima. Comparisons of differential expression were made using the mesentery as a reference against 24 hour and 3 days regenerating intestine, revealing a large number of differentially expressed transcripts. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis showed evidence of increasing transcriptional activity. Further analysis of transcripts associated with transcription factors revealed diverse expression patterns with mechanisms involving developmental and cancer-related activity that could be related to the regenerative process. Our study demonstrates the broad and diversified gene expression profile during the early stages of the process using the mesentery as the focal point of intestinal regeneration. It also establishes the genes that are the most important candidates in the cellular processes that underlie regenerative responses.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic control is mediated by the dynamic assemblies and function of multiple redox enzymes. A key element in these assemblies, the P450 oxidoreductase (POR), donates electrons and selectively activates numerous (>50 in humans and >300 in plants) cytochromes P450 (CYPs) controlling metabolism of drugs, steroids and xenobiotics in humans and natural product biosynthesis in plants. The mechanisms underlying POR-mediated CYP metabolism remain poorly understood and to date no ligand binding has been described to regulate the specificity of POR. Here, using a combination of computational modeling and functional assays, we identified ligands that dock on POR and bias its specificity towards CYP redox partners. Single molecule FRET studies revealed ligand docking to alter POR conformational sampling, which resulted in biased activation of metabolic cascades in whole cell assays. We propose the model of biased metabolism, a mechanism akin to biased signaling of GPCRs, where ligand docking on POR stabilizes different conformational states that are linked to distinct metabolic outcomes. Biased metabolism may allow designing pathway-specific therapeutics or personalized food suppressing undesired, disease related, metabolic pathways.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients frequently suffer from undetected micrometastatic disease. This clinical situation would greatly benefit from additional investigation. Therefore, we set out to identify key signalling events that drive metastatic evolution from the pancreas.\n\nWe researched a gene signature that could discriminate localised PDAC from confirmed metastatic PDAC and devised a preclinical protocol using circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) as an early biomarker of micro-metastatic disease to validate the identification of key signalling events.\n\nAmongst actionable markers of disease progression, the PI3K pathway and a distinctive PI3K activation signature predict PDAC aggressiveness and prognosis. Pharmacological or tumour-restricted genetic PI3K-selective inhibition prevented macro-metastatic evolution by inhibiting tumoural cell migratory behaviour independently of genetic alterations. We found that PI3K inhibition altered the quantity and the species composition of the lipid second messenger PIP3 produced, with selective reduction of C36:2 PI-3,4,5-P3. PI3K inactivation prevented the accumulation of protumoural CD206-positive macrophages in the tumour-adjacent tissue.\n\nTumour-cell intrinsic PI3K therefore promotes pro-metastatic features that could be pharmacologically targeted to delay macro-metastatic evolution.\n\nThe paper explainedPROBLEM Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal solid cancers characterised by rapid progression after primary tumour detection by imaging. Key signalling events that specifically drives this rapid evolution into macro-metastatic disease are so far poorly understood.\n\nRESULT With two unbiased approaches to patient data analysis, higher PI3K pathway and more specifically higher PI3K activation signature can now be identified in the most aggressive pancreatic cancer primary tumours, that lead to earlier patient death. Our in vitro data showed that PI3K is a major positive regulator of tumour cell escape from the primary tumour: tumour-intrinsic PI3K activity enables actin cytoskeleton remodelling to escape the pancreatic tumour. We chose to use two preclinical models of pancreatic cancer to validate that PI3K is a target for delaying evolution of PDAC. The first one mimicked pancreatic patient micrometastatic disease that is undetected by echography and consisted in treating mice presenting echography detected primary tumours combined with increased circulating DNA as a blood biomarker of the most aggressive tumours. The second model consisted in studying the tumour cell implantation and their early proliferation in metastatic organ after injection in blood. We treated both preclinical models with a clinically relevant PI3K -selective inhibitor (BYL-719/Alpelisib), that is currently being tested in pancreatic cancer patients (without any patient selection). We found that PI3K activity drives evolution of micrometastatic disease towards macro-metastatic stage in both models: inhibition of PI3K delayed primary tumour and micro-metastasis evolution. Finally, PI3K activity increases protumoural characteristics in peritumoural immune cells via tumour cell-intrinsic cytokine production that could facilitate metastatic evolution.\n\nIMPACT Circulating tumour DNA represents a strong independent biomarker linked to relapse and poor survival in solid cancer patients. A clinical study in resected PDAC patients with micrometastatic disease characterised by high circulating tumoural DNA levels is needed to assess if PI3K-selective inhibitors significantly delay metastatic progression and death.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=103 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/307884v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a5a8b4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e6e18dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e22859org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c7148b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma requires tumour-intrinsic PI3K activity to accelerate inflammatory metastatic disease.\n\nBiorender illustration.\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "IL-6 signaling via its receptor (IL-6R) and co-receptor (gp130) performs multiple roles in regulating metabolic homeostasis. However, gp130 is also expressed systemically in a soluble form (sgp130), which limits soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R)-mediated signaling - also called trans-signaling. Here we find that transgenic peripheral sgp130-mediated trans-signaling blockade induces mature-onset obesity, while differentially affecting age-dependent behavioral determinants of energy expenditure. In youth, trans-signaling blockade increases feeding associated with reduced leptin sensitivity but increases energy expenditure to maintain metabolic balance. In aging, reduced physical activity predisposes mice to adiposity, adipose tissue macrophage recruitment, hepatosteatosis, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance. Mechanistically, trans-signaling blockade reduces hepatic Stat3 phosphorylation and suppresses PPAR, associated with miR-21 upregulation, while pharmacological activation of PPAR prevents obesity and hepatosteatosis, and rescues insulin sensitivity. Together these experiments reveal a role for peripheral IL-6 trans-signaling in metabolic homeostasis and provide clinical significance to elevated sgp130 levels found in some obese and diabetic patients.",

    "abstract": "The de novo design of simplified porphyrin-binding helical bundles is a versatile approach for the construction of valuable biomolecular tools to both understand and enhance protein functions such as electron transfer, oxygen binding and catalysis. However, the methods utilised to design such proteins by packing hydrophobic side chains into a buried binding pocket for ligands such as heme have typically created highly flexible, molten globule-like structures, which are not amenable to structural determination, hindering precise engineering of subsequent designs. Here we report the crystal structure of a de novo two-heme binding \"maquette\" protein, 4D2, derived from the previously designed D2 peptide, offering new opportunities for computational design and re-engineering. The 4D2 structure was used as a basis to create a range of heme binding proteins which retain the architecture and stability of the initial crystal structure. A well-structured single-heme binding variant was constructed by computational sequence redesign of the hydrophobic protein core, assessed by NMR, and utilised for experimental validation of computational redox prediction and design. The structure was also extended into a four-heme binding helical bundle resembling a molecular wire. Despite a molecular weight of only 24kDa, imaging by CryoEM illustrated a remarkable level of detail in this structure, indicating the positioning of both the secondary structure and the heme cofactors. The design and determination of atomic-level resolution in such de novo proteins is an invaluable resource for the continued development of novel and functional protein tools.",

We therefore assessed the fungal communities associated with the spoilage of ready-to-eat (RTE) pineapple using a metagenetic amplicon sequencing approach, based on the ITS2 region. Our results revealed a significant variability on fungal species composition between the different batches of RTE pineapple. The initial microbiota composition was the main influencing factor and determined the progress of spoilage. Temperature and storage time were the secondary factors influencing spoilage and their impact was depending on the initial prevalent fungal species, which showed different responses to the various modifications. Our results strongly suggest that further large-scale sampling of RTE pineapple production should be conducted in order to assess the full biodiversity range of fungal community involved in the spoilage process and for unravelling the impact of important environmental factors shaping the initial microbiota.",

    "abstract": "Morbilliviruses, such as measles virus (MeV) and canine distemper virus (CDV), are highly infectious members of the paramyxovirus family. MeV is responsible for major morbidity and mortality in non-vaccinated populations. ERDRP-0519, a pan-morbillivirus small molecule inhibitor for the treatment of measles, targets the morbillivirus RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRP) complex and displayed unparalleled oral efficacy against lethal infection of ferrets with CDV, an established surrogate model for human measles. Resistance profiling identified the L subunit of the RdRP, which harbors all enzymatic activity of the polymerase complex, as the molecular target of inhibition. Here, we examined binding characteristics, physical docking site, and the molecular mechanism of action of ERDRP-0519 through label-free biolayer interferometry, photoaffinity cross-linking, and in vitro RdRP assays using purified MeV RdRP complexes and synthetic templates. Results demonstrate that unlike all other mononegavirus small molecule inhibitors identified to date, ERDRP-0519 inhibits all phosphodiester bond formation in both de novo initiation of RNA synthesis at the promoter and RNA elongation by a committed polymerase complex. Photocrosslinking and resistance profiling-informed ligand docking revealed that this unprecedented mechanism of action of ERDRP-0519 is due to simultaneous engagement of the L protein polyribonucleotidyl transferase (PRNTase)-like domain and the flexible intrusion loop by the compound, pharmacologically locking the polymerase in pre-initiation conformation. This study informs selection of ERDRP-0519 as clinical candidate for measles therapy and identifies a previously unrecognized druggable site in mononegavirus L polymerase proteins that can silence all synthesis of viral RNA.\n\nImportanceThe mononegavirus order contains major established and recently emerged human pathogens. Despite the threat to human health, antiviral therapeutics directed against this order remain understudied. The mononegavirus polymerase complex represents a promising drug target due to its central importance for both virus replication and viral mitigation of the innate host antiviral response. In this study, we have mechanistically characterized a clinical candidate small-molecule MeV polymerase inhibitor. The compound blocked all phosphodiester bond formation activity, a unique mechanism of action unlike all other known mononegavirus polymerase inhibitors. Photocrosslinking-based target site mapping demonstrated that this class-defining prototype inhibitor stabilizes a pre-initiation conformation of the viral polymerase complex that sterically cannot accommodate template RNA. Function-equivalent druggable sites exist in all mononegavirus polymerases. In addition to its direct anti-MeV impact, the insight gained in this study can therefore serve as a blueprint for indication spectrum expansion through structure-informed scaffold engineering or targeted drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Microbes commonly exists in diverse and complex communities where species interact, and their genomic repertoires evolve over time. Our understanding of species interactions and evolution has increased in the last decades, but most studies of evolutionary dynamics are based on single species in isolation or in experimental systems composed of few interacting species. Here, we use the microbial ecosystem found in groundwater-fed sand filters as a model to avoid this limitation. In these open systems, diverse microbial communities experience relatively stable conditions, and the coupling between chemical and biological processes is generally well defined. Metagenomic analysis of 12 sand filters revealed systematic co-occurrence of at least five comammox Nitrospira species, likely promoted by low ammonium concentrations. These Nitrospira species showed intra-population sequence diversity, although possible clonal expansion was detected in few abundant local comammox populations. They showed low homologous recombination and strong purifying selection, the latter process being especially strong in genes essential in energy metabolism. Positive selection was detected on genes related to resistance to foreign DNA and phages. We found that, compared to other habitats, groundwater-fed sand filters impose strong purifying selection and low recombination on comammox Nitrospira populations. These results suggest that evolutionary processes are more affected by habitat type than by species identity. Together, this study improves our understanding of species interactions and evolution in complex microbial communities, and sheds light on the environmental dependency of evolutionary processes.",

Dysregulated shedding is linked to severe diseases, including cancer and Alzheimers disease. However, the exact cleavage sites of shedding substrates remain largely unknown. Here, we explore the landscape of ectodomain shedding by generating large-scale, cell-type-specific maps of shedding cleavage sites. By means of N- and C-terminal peptide enrichment and quantitative mass spectrometry, we quantified protein termini in the culture media of 10 human cell lines and identified 411 cleavage sites on the ectodomain of 132 membrane proteins whose proteolytic terminal fragments are downregulated in the presence of a broad-spectrum metalloprotease inhibitor. A major fraction of the presented cleavage sites was identified in a cell-type-specific manner, and mapped onto receptors, cell adhesion molecules, and protein kinases and phosphatases. We confidently identified 86 cleavage sites as metalloprotease substrates by means of knowledge-based scoring.",

    "abstract": "The vertebrate eye primordium consists of a pseudostratified neuroepithelium, the optic vesicle (OV), in which cells acquire neural retina or retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) fates. As these fates arise, the OV assumes a cup-shape, influenced by mechanical forces generated within the neural retina. Whether the RPE passively adapts to retinal changes or actively contributes to OV morphogenesis remains unexplored. Here, we generated a zebrafish Tg(E1-bhlhe40:GFP) line to track RPE morphogenesis and interrogate its participation in OV folding. We show that, in virtual absence of proliferation, RPE cells stretch into a squamous configuration, thereby matching the curvature of the underlying retina. Forced proliferation and localized interference with the RPE cytoskeleton disrupt its stretching and OV folding. Thus, extreme RPE flattening and accelerated differentiation are efficient solutions adopted by fast-developing species to enable timely optic cup formation. This mechanism differs in amniotes, in which proliferation largely drives RPE expansion with a much-reduced need of cell flattening.",

The male specific RNA-binding protein NANOS2 has a key role in suppressing the cell cycle in germ cells. However, the detailed mechanism of how NANOS2 regulates the cell cycle remains unclear. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we extracted the cell cycle state of each germ cell in wild-type and Nanos2-KO testes, and revealed that Nanos2 expression starts in mitotic cells and induces mitotic arrest. We also found that NANOS2 and p38 MAPK work in parallel to regulate the cell cycle, suggesting that several different cascades are involved in the induction of cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, we identified Rheb, a regulator of mTORC1, and Ptma as possible targets of NANOS2. We propose that the repression of the cell cycle is a primary function of NANOS2 and that it is mediated via the suppression of mTORC1 activity by repressing Rheb in a post-transcriptional manner.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiota is critical for host function. Among mammals, host phylogenetic relatedness and diet are strong drivers of gut microbiota structure, but one factor may be more influential than the other. Here, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to determine the relative contributions of host phylogeny and host dietary guild in structuring the gut microbiotas of 11 herbivore species from 5 families living sympatrically in southwest Kenya. Herbivore species were classified as grazers, browsers, or mixed-feeders. We found that gut microbiotas were highly species-specific, and that host taxonomy accounted for more variation in the gut microbiota (30%) than did host dietary guild (10%) or sample month (8%). Overall, similarity among gut microbiotas increased with host phylogenetic relatedness (r=0.73), yet this relationship was not consistent among seven closely related Bovid host species (r=0.21 NS). Within bovids, host dietary guild explained more of the variation in the gut microbiota than did host species. Lastly, while we found that the gut microbiotas of herbivores residing in southwest Kenya converge with those of distinct populations of conspecifics from central Kenya, fine-scale differences in the abundances of bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) between individuals from the two regions were also observed. Overall, our findings suggest that host phylogeny and taxonomy strongly structure the gut microbiota, but these gut microbial communities could be furthered modified by host ecology, especially among closely related host species.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a new global threat demanding a multidisciplinary effort to fight its etiological agent--severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this regard, immunoinformatics may aid to predict prominent immunogenic regions from critical SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, such as the spike (S) glycoprotein, for their use in prophylactic or therapeutic interventions against this rapidly emerging coronavirus. Accordingly, in this study, an integrated immunoinformatics approach was applied to identify cytotoxic T cell (CTC), T helper cell (THC), and Linear B cell (BC) epitopes from the S glycoprotein in an attempt to design a high-quality multi-epitope vaccine. The best CTC, THC, and BC epitopes showed high viral antigenicity, lack of allergenic or toxic residues, and suitable HLA-viral peptide interactions. Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and its receptor-binding motif (RBM) harbour several potential epitopes. The structure prediction, refinement, and validation data indicate that the multi-epitope vaccine has an appropriate conformation and stability. Three conformational epitopes and an efficient binding between Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the vaccine model were observed. Importantly, the population coverage analysis showed that the multi-epitope vaccine could be used globally. Notably, computer-based simulations suggest that the vaccine model has a robust potential to evoke and maximize both immune effector responses and immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2. Further research is needed to accomplish with the mandatory international guidelines for human vaccine formulations.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=96 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/312355v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (18K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16be58forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ac31ddorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fdd5c0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dc55b0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "When T-cells probe their environment for antigens, the bond between the T-cell receptor (TCR) and the peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is put under tension, thereby influencing the antigen discrimination process. Yet, the quantification of such forces in the context of T-cell signaling is technically challenging. Common approaches such as traction force microscopy (TFM) employ a global readout of the force fields, e.g. by measuring the displacements of hydrogel-embedded marker beads. Recent data, however, indicated that T-cells exert tensile forces locally via TCR-enriched microvilli while scanning the surface of antigen-presenting cells. Here, we developed a traction force microscopy platform, which allows for quantifying the pulls exerted via T-cell microvilli, in both tangential and normal directions, during T-cell activation. For this, we immobilized specific T-cell activating antibodies directly on the marker beads used to read out the hydrogel deformation. Microvilli targeted the functionalized beads, as confirmed by superresolution microscopy of the local actin organization. Moreover, we found that cellular components, such as actin, TCR and CD45 reorganize upon interaction with the beads, such that actin forms a vortex-like ring structure around the beads and TCR is enriched at the bead surface, whereas, CD45 is excluded from bead-microvilli contacts.\n\nSignificance statementDuring the antigen recognition process, T-cells explore and probe their environment via microvilli, which exert local pushes and pulls at the surface of the antigen presenting cell. It is currently believed that these forces influence or even enable the antigen recognition process. Here, we describe the development of a platform, which allows us to quantify the magnitude and direction of traction forces exerted locally by T cell microvilli. Simultaneous Ca2+ imaging was used to link the measured forces to the overall T cell activation status. Superresolution microscopy resolved the contact sites of bead-microvilli contact at the nanoscale: cells contacted beads via actin vortex-like structures, which excluded the phosphatase CD45 from the contacts.",

    "abstract": "Topological transitions of membranes, such as pore formation or membrane fusion, play key roles in biology, biotechnology, and in medical applications. Calculating the related free energy landscapes has been complicated by the fact that such processes involve a sequence of transitions along highly distinct directions in conformational space, making it difficult to define good reaction coordinates (RCs) for the overall process. In this study, we present a new RC capable of driving both pore nucleation and pore expansion in lipid membranes. The potential of mean force (PMF) along the RC computed with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provides a comprehensive view on the free-energy landscape of pore formation, including a barrier for pore nucleation, the size, free energy, and metastability of the open pore, and the energetic cost for further pore expansion against the line tension of the pore rim. We illustrate the RC by quantifying the effects (i) of simulation system size and (ii) of the addition of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) on the free energy landscape of pore formation. PMF calculations along the RC provide mechanistic and energetic understanding of pore formation, hence they will be useful to rationalize the effects of membrane-active peptides, electric fields, and membrane composition on transmembrane pores.",

Uterine specific deletion of Arid1a compromises gland development and diminishes Foxa2 and Lif expression. Deletion of Arid1a with Ltf-iCre in the adult mouse endometrial epithelium preserves gland development while still compromising gland function. Mice lacking endometrial epithelial Arid1a are severely sub-fertile due to defects in implantation, decidualization, and endometrial receptivity from disruption of the LIF-STAT3-EGR1 pathway. FOXA2 is also reduced in the endometrium of women with endometriosis in correlation with diminished ARID1A, and both ARID1A and FOXA2 are reduced in non-human primates induced with endometriosis. Our findings describe a role for ARID1A in the endometrial epithelium supporting early pregnancy establishment through the maintenance of gland function.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIschemic stroke is an acquired brain injury with gender dependent outcomes. A persistent obstacle in understanding the sex-specific neuroinflammatory contributions to ischemic brain injury is distinguishing between resident microglia versus infiltrating macrophages--both phagocytes--and determining cell population specific contributions to injury evolution and recovery processes. Our purpose was to identify microglial and macrophage populations regulated by ischemic stroke using morphology analysis and the presence of microglia transmembrane protein 119 (TMEM119). Second, we examined sex and menopause differences in microglia/macrophage cell populations after an ischemic stroke.\n\nMethodsMale and female, premenopausal and postmenopausal, mice underwent either 60-min of middle cerebral artery occlusion and 24-h of reperfusion or sham surgery. The accelerated ovarian failure model was used to model post-menopause. Brain tissue was collected to quantify infarct area and for immunohistochemistry and western blot methods. Ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule, TMEM119, and confocal microscopy were used to analyze microglia morphology and TMEM119 area in ipsilateral brain regions. Western blot was used to quantify protein quantity.\n\nResultsPost-stroke injury is increased in male and female post-menopause mice versus pre-menopause female mice (p<0.05) with differences primarily occurring in caudal sections. After stroke, microglia underwent a region, but not sex group, dependent transformation into less ramified cells (p<0.0001). However, the number of phagocytic microglia were increased in distal ipsilateral regions of postmenopausal mice versus the other sex groups (p<0.05). The number of TMEM119 positive cells was decreased in proximity to the infarct (p<0.0001) but without a sex group effect. Two key findings prevented distinguishing microglia from systemic macrophages. First, morphological data were not congruent with TMEM119 immunofluorescence data. Cells with severely decreased TMEM119 immunofluorescence were ramified, a distinguishing microglia characteristic. Second, whereas TMEM119 immunofluorescence area decreased in proximity to the infarcted area, TMEM119 protein quantity was unchanged in ipsilateral hemisphere regions using western blot methods.\n\nConclusionsOur findings suggest that TMEM119 is not a stable microglia marker in male and female mice in the context of ischemic stroke. Until TMEM119 function in the brain is elucidated, its use to distinguish between cell populations following brain injury with cell infiltration is cautioned.",

Here, we demonstrate this process amplifies autoantibody pathogenicity in a classic IgG4-mediated autoimmune disease: muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) myasthenia gravis (MG). In mice, monovalent anti-MuSK IgG4s caused rapid and severe myasthenic muscle weakness, whereas the same antibodies in their parental bivalent form were less potent or did not induce a phenotype. Mechanistically this could be explained by opposing effects on MuSK signaling. Isotype switching to IgG4 in an autoimmune response thereby may be a critical step in the development of disease. Our study establishes functional monovalency as a novel pathogenic mechanism in IgG4-mediated autoimmune disease and potentially other disorders.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=146 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/296293v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (38K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@45c221org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cc31cdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d9b09borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d9b681_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Understanding peoples fire practices, knowledge and perceptions of the use of fire and fire regimes can inform fire management plans that could contribute to sustainable savanna conservation and management. We investigated the frequency of fire use, control and perceptions of fire regime for selected livelihood and socio-cultural activities in six districts in the Guinea savanna of Ghana. The majority of respondents (83%) across the study districts indicated that they used fire once a year for at least one of the following activities: land preparation, weed/grass/pest control, burning stubble after harvest, bush clearing around homesteads, firebreaks, charcoal burning and hunting. The study showed a higher frequency of fire use in the dry season for land preparation for cropping. Less than a fifth of the respondents (17%) indicated that they do not use fire for any of the above activities. The majority of respondents (62%) across the districts mentioned that they controlled their use of fire to prevent destruction to property, with the remaining 3% who indicated the prevention of killing or injuring humans. The study showed a higher frequency of fire use for land preparation for cropping than for the other socio-cultural activities. However, respondents rated season of burning as the most important attribute, with little attention to the other attributes of a fire regime, contrary to what is theoretically recognized. Understanding traditional fire use practices in terms how to regulate the mix of frequency, intensity/severity, season, size and type of fire for these and other socio-cultural purposes could enhance sustainable savanna conservation and management. There is a need to unravel the specifics of fire assisted socio-cultural practices and fire regimes in West Africa.",

    "abstract": "LTR-retrotransposons are structurally similar to retroviruses, as they possess the enzymes reverse transcriptase, Ribonuclease H, integrase, proteinase, and the gag gene and are flanked by long terminal repeats (LTRs). The 412/mdg1 lineage, belonging to the Ty3/Gypsy group, consists of the TEs 412, mdg1, stalker, pilgrim, and blood. The 412/mdg1 lineage is distinguished from the others in the gypsy group in that it has small ORFs at the beginning of the TE and is highly similar to the pol ORF among the TEs that make up the lineage. In this study, our aim was to elucidate the evolutionary history of the 412/mdg1 lineage in the 127 dipteran genomes available to date, and the characteristics of the sequences in each genome. We used the canonical TE 412 probe described in Drosophila melanogaster as the query. We found sequences homologous to the 412/mdg1 lineage restricted to the suborder Brachycera. These sequences are widely distributed in drosophilids but are also present in other groups of flies. We note the presence of the 412/mg1 lineage in tsetse flies (Glossina). Furthermore, our results showed an elaborate evolutionary history for the pol ORF in the 412/mdg1 lineage of the LTR-Retrotransposon.",

    "abstract": "Shape analysis of a closed 2D contour is an important topic within biological shape analysis, where Fourier methods to reproduce the shape with a limited number of parameters have been and still are of vital importance. An example is within marine management research on fish, where shape analysis of otolith (earstone) contours is performed for species identification as well as for stock discrimination purposes. In both cases, it is expected that the fewer parameters that are needed in a method to reproduce the contour sufficiently good, the better. This contribution outlines how a convex contour of any shape can be represented to any wanted accuracy by only one Fourier component. The key idea is to allow a flexible choice of a predetermined number of x-values along an x-axis that goes through the two most distant points of the contour. The y-variable along the perpendicular y-axis is then monotonically transformed to a z-variable so that the minium and maximum z-values on the contour have the same distance from the x-axis. The x-values of the contour points are now chosen so that the corresponding z-values on the contour follows a perfect sinusoid if the x-values were equidistant. The method is illustrated by application to lasso contours of Norwegian Coastal Cod (NCC) and North East Arctic Cod (NEAC) otolith images, where the average new x-positions for the individual otolith contours were applied to all otoliths. The results show that a considerably better fit to the original individual otolith contours were obtained by applying the invers FFT to the new y-values than by the frequently applied 2D EFDs (Elliptical Fourier Descriptors) approach, for the same number, m < 11, of frequency components. A promising classification result was also obtained by the linear Fisher discrimination method and cross validation applied to the individual x-values for the NCC and NEAC otoliths, with 82% score for NCC and 80% score for NEAC with sample sizes 367 and 240, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial spot (BS) disease of pepper, incited by Xanthomonas campestris pv. Vesicatoria (Xcv), is one of the most serious diseases. For a comparative analysis of defense response to Xcv infection, we performed a transcriptome analysis of BS -susceptible cultivar ECW and -resistant cultivar VI037601 using the HiSeq 2500 sequencing platform. Approximately 140.15 G clean data were generated from eighteen libraries. From the libraries generated, we identified 52,041 genes including 35,336 reference genes, 16,705 novel transcripts, and 4,794 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). There were 1,291, 2,956, 1,795 and 2,448 DEGs in ECW-24h-vs-ECW-0h, ECW-48h-vs-ECW-0h, VI037601-24h-vs-VI037601-0h and VI037601-48h-vs-VI037601-0h groups, respectively. Interestingly, DEGs involved in disease response in the resistant variety were induced at an earlier stage and at higher levels compared with the susceptible variety. Key enriched categories included amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis and MAPK signaling pathway. Moreover, 273 DEGs only differentially expressed in VI037601 and 436 overlapping DEGs in ECW and VI037601 post Xcv inoculation, including NBS-LRR genes, oxidoreductase gene, WRKY and NAC transcription factors were identified, which were mainly involved in metabolic process, response to stimulus and biological regulation pathways. Quantitative RT-PCR of sixteen selected DEGs further validated the RNA-seq differential gene expression analysis. Our results will provide a valuable resource for understanding the molecular mechanisms of pepper resistance to Xcv infection and improving pepper resistance cultivars against Xcv.",

The low response rate of melanoma to existing treatment modalities is a substantial threat to patients and researchers. It is crucial to identify new therapeutic agents for the fatal malignancy melanoma. Vitexin is a flavonoid compound in many traditional Chinese medicines that exhibits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-tumour activities in many cancer cells. In our study, we elucidated the inhibitory effects of vitexin on invasion and metastasis in human melanoma A375 and C8161 cells in vitro. After vitexin treatment for 24 h or 48 h, the invasive ability and migration of melanoma cells were decreased in a dose- and time-dependent manners. In western blot analysis, we verified that vitexin inhibited the expression levels of MMP-2, MMP-9, vimentin, Slug and Twist which are known as the regulators of protein degradation and promote various cell behaviours such as migration and invasion. To further investigate the target signal that may be influenced by vitexin, immunofluorescence assay was performed to observe STAT3 localization and western blot results showed that vitexin decreased the expression of the phosphorylation of kinases that inducing STAT3 activation. Accordingly, we provide inspiring insight into the basic inhibition mechanism of vitexin, which will soon be an issue due to its scientific potential for further development as a novel anti-tumour agent for the clinical therapy of human melanoma.",

The ADRs, groups of associated drugs, and affected organs were classified.\n\nResultsA total of 5,415 reports of ADRs associated with biotech drugs were identified in 78 Colombian cities. A total of 76.1% of the cases corresponded to women. The majority were classified as type A (55.0%) and B (28.9%), and 16.7% were serious cases. The respiratory tract was the most commonly affected organ system (16.8%), followed by the skin and adnexa (15.6%). Antineoplastic and immunomodulatory drugs accounted for 70.6% of the reports, and the drugs related to the greatest number of ADRs were adalimumab (12.2%) and etanercept (11.6%).\n\nConclusionsThere has been an incremental increase in the reporting of ADRs associated with the use of biotech drugs in the pharmacovigilance program, related to the strengthening and appropriation of the patient safety culture and improvement in the quality of the generated information. It is important to empower physicians and entire health teams to ensure the traceability of ADRs and to perform interdisciplinary interventions derived from pharmacovigilance at the individual and population levels.",

    "abstract": "Testosterone is considered a potent anabolic agent in skeletal muscle with a well-established role in adolescent growth and development in males. However, alterations in the role of testosterone in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass and function throughout the lifespan has yet to be established. While some studies suggest that testosterone is important for the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass, an understanding of the role this hormone plays in young, adult, and old males with normal and low serum testosterone levels is lacking. We investigated the role testosterone plays in the maintenance of muscle mass by examining the effect of orchiectomy-induced testosterone depletion in C57Bl6 male mice at ages ranging from early postnatal through old age; the age groups we used included 1.5-, 5-, 12-, and 24-month old mice. Following 28 days of testosterone depletion, we assessed mass and fiber cross-sectional-area (CSA) of the tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, and quadriceps muscles. In addition, we measured global rates of protein synthesis and degradation using the SuNSET method, western blots, and enzyme activity assays. 28 days of testosterone depletion resulted in smaller muscle mass in the two youngest cohorts but had no effect in the two older ones. Mean CSA decreased only in the youngest cohort and only in the tibialis anterior muscle. Testosterone depletion resulted in a general increase in proteasome activity at all ages. We did not detect changes in protein synthesis at the terminal time point. This data suggest that within physiological serum concentrations, testosterone is not important for the maintenance of muscle mass in mature male mice; however, in young mice testosterone is crucial for normal growth.",

Effectors typically function by associating with host molecules and modulating their activities. This study aimed to identify the host processes targeted by the RXLR class of host-translocated effectors of the potato blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans. To this end, we performed an in planta protein-protein interaction screen by transiently expressing P. infestans RXLR effectors in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves followed by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This screen generated an effector-host protein interactome matrix of 59 P. infestans RXLR effectors x 586 N. benthamiana proteins. Classification of the host interactors into putative functional categories revealed over 35 biological processes possibly targeted by P. infestans. We further characterized the PexRD12/31 family of RXLR-WY effectors, which associate and co-localize with components of the vesicle trafficking machinery. One member of this family, PexRD31, increased the number of FYVE positive vesicles in N. benthamiana cells. FYVE positive vesicles also accumulated in leaf cells near P. infestans hyphae, indicating that the pathogen may enhance endosomal trafficking during infection. We anticipate that the interactome dataset we generated will serve as a useful community resource for functional studies of P. infestans effectors and of effector-targeted host processes.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesExtended-spectrum {beta}-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-Ec) are frequently acquired during international travel, contributing to the global spread of antimicrobial resistance. Human-adapted ESBL-Ec are predicted to exhibit increased intestinal carriage duration, resulting in a higher likelihood of onward human-to-human transmission. Yet, bacterial determinants of increased carriage duration are unknown. Previous studies analysed small traveler cohorts, with short follow-up times, or did not employ high-resolution molecular typing, and were thus unable to identify bacterial traits associated with long-term carriage.\n\nMethodsIn a prospective cohort study of 2001 international travelers, we analysed 160 faecal ESBL-Ec isolates from all 38 travelers who acquired ESBL-Ec during travel and subsequently carried ESBL-Ec for at least 12 months after return, by whole-genome sequencing. For 17 travelers, we confirmed the persistence of ESBL-Ec strains through single nucleotide variant typing. To identify determinants of increased carriage duration, we compared the 17 long-term carriers ([&ge;]12 months carriage) with 33 age-, sex- and destination-matched short-term carriers (<1 month carriage). Long-read sequencing was employed to investigate ESBL plasmid persistence.\n\nResultsWe show that in healthy travelers with very low antibiotic usage, extraintestinal pathogenic lineages of E. coli (ExPEC) are significantly more likely to persist than other E. coli lineages. The long-term carriage of E. coli from ExPEC lineages is mainly driven by sequence type 131 and phylogroup D E. coli.\n\nConclusionsAlthough ExPEC frequently cause extra-intestinal infections such as bloodstream infections, our results imply that ExPEC are also efficient intestinal colonizers, which potentially contributes to their onward transmission.",

    "abstract": "The silkworm, Bombyx mori, is a complete metamorphosis insect, the model to study insect physiology and biochemistry. Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) is a principal pathogen of the silkworm and its host range is restricted to silkworm larvae, requiring interaction with larvae to accomplish virus replication. Prothoracic glands (PGs) are a model for synthetic ecdysone with regulating insect growth and development. This study performed a transcriptome analysis of silkworm PGs after BmNPV infection. Transcriptome data were annotated with KEGG, GO, and shown to be of high quality by RT-qPCR. The spatial expression profiles of BmJing and BmAryl indicate that they may be specifically expressed in silkworm PGs. The RT-qPCR results of the DEGs in the PGs of BmNPV-infected larvae at 24, 48, and 72 h and at the developmental stages of days-6 and 7, comparing to day-3, reveal that the DEGs may be related to the BmNPV infection via promoting early maturation in the latter half of the silkworm fifth instar. This study is the first report on the identification of possible genes in PGs correlating with the precocious molting and metamorphosis of silkworm larvae under BmNPV infection in the latter half of the fifth instar. Our findings will help to address the interactions between BmNPV infection and host developmental response. This work provides a new perspective on BmNPV infection and host developmental response, as well as suggesting candidate genes for further research.",

In Phase 2, a further 44 children completed SAM complete and, including those children completing SAM in Phase 1 (total n=105), a machine learning algorithm was developed using a \"majority vote\" procedure where, for each child, 500 non-overlapping video frames contribute to the decision.\n\nResultsUsing manual rating, SAM-MCAST concordance was excellent (89% secure versus insecure; 97% organised versus disorganised; 86% four-way). Comparison of human ratings of SAM versus the machine learning algorithm showed over 80% concordance.\n\nConclusionsWe have developed a new tool for measuring attachment at the population level, which has good reliability compared to a gold-standard attachment measure and has the potential for automatic rating - opening the door to measurement of attachment in large populations.",

    "abstract": "Scientific assessment of regional ecosystem service value (ESV) is helpful to make scientific ecological protection plan and compensation policy. The evaluation method has not been established that is adapted to the complex and diverse characteristics of the ecological environment. This paper takes Gansu Province as an example, on the basis of fully considering the regional differences of ecosystem service function, the five correction index of value equivalent factor per unit area were constructed in the provincial scale, and the regional difference adjustment index of 11 kinds of ES was constructed in regional scale, in the way, the value evaluation model based on regional difference was established. The results show that in 2015, the total ESV reached 2239.555 billion Yuan in Gansu Province, ESV gradually increased from the northeast to the southwest, and the high-value areas of service function located in Qilian Mountain and Longnan Mountain, of which the forest and grassland ecosystem contributed the most to the value. From the perspective of value composition, local climate regulation and biodiversity maintenance function are the main service functions of Gansu Province. From 2000 to 2015, ESV increased by 3.426 billion Yuan in Gansu Province, the value of forest and urban ecosystem continued increasing, while the value of cultivated land ecosystem continue decreasing. From the spatial characteristics of service value change, the area of value reduction gradually moved from the central part of Gansu Province to the surrounding area. In general, although this study needs further improvement, the constructed evaluation method provides a relatively comprehensive evaluation scheme for the spatiotemporal dynamic evaluation of ESV in Gansu Province. This study provided a more overall research idea for the evaluation of ESV under complex ecological environment.",

    "abstract": "Sexual selection researchers have traditionally focused on adult sex differences; however, the schedule and pattern of sex-specific ontogeny can provide insights unobtainable from an exclusive focus on adults. Recently, it has been debated whether facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR; bi-zygomatic breadth divided by midface height) is a human secondary sexual characteristic (SSC). Here, we review current evidence, then address this debate using ontogenetic evidence, which has been under-explored in fWHR research. Facial measurements collected from males and females aged 3 to 40 (Study 1; US, n=2449), and 7 to 21 (Study 2; Bolivia, n=179) were used to calculate three fWHR variants (which we call fWHRnasion, fWHRstomion, and fWHRbrow) and two other common facial masculinity ratios (facial width-to-lower-face-height ratio, fWHRlower, and cheekbone prominence). We test whether the observed pattern of facial development exhibits patterns indicative of SSCs, i.e. differential adolescent growth in either male or female facial morphology leading to an adult sex difference. Results showed that only fWHRlower exhibited both adult sex differences as well as the classic pattern of ontogeny for SSCs--greater lower-face growth in male adolescents relative to females. fWHRbrow was significantly wider among both pre- and post-pubertal males in the 2D sample; post-hoc analyses revealed that the effect was driven by large sex differences in brow height, with females having higher placed brows than males across ages. In both samples, all fWHR measures were inversely associated with age; that is, human facial growth is characterized by greater relative growth in the mid-face and lower face relative to facial width. This trend continues even into middle adulthood. BMI was also a positive predictor of most of the ratios across ages, with greater BMI associated with wider faces. Researchers collecting data on fWHR should target fWHRlower and fWHRbrow and should control for both age and BMI.",

    "abstract": "The evolution and domestication of pigs is a complex and ongoing process. Despite its rich biodiversity and proximity to the geographical origins of Sus scrofa domesticus, the place of Indian pigs in the global phylogeny is unclear. Using microarray-derived (porcine 60K SNP chip) genotypes of 11 Ghurrah pigs from North-Western India and a public dataset comprising 2113 pigs of 146 breeds, we determined the genomic ancestry of Ghurrah pigs and compared their genetic constitution to European and Asian breeds to ascertain signatures of divergent selection. Results showed that Ghurrah pigs contain genes of Asian and European ancestry with signs of inter-species introgression. Using Admixture LD - decay statistics, the European admixture event was dated to the recent past, coinciding with the start of cross-breeding efforts in India. The complex Asian ancestry pattern of the breed resembled that of wild boars of South - Central China and Thailand, possibly suggesting introgression from an Indian wild boar relative. FST and XP - EHH comparisons with Asian breeds highlighted divergent selection in genomic regions associated with odontogenesis and skeletal muscle development. Comparisons with European commercial breeds revealed that genomic regions governing olfaction and response to sensory stimulation were under selection in Ghurrah pigs. QTL for meat and carcass traits also showed divergent selection between European breeds and Ghurrah pigs. Our results present the first genomic characterization of an Indian pig breed using dense microarray-derived genotypes and highlight the importance of further genomic characterization of Indian domestic and wild pigs.",

    "abstract": "Multiple human behaviors improve early in life, peaking in young adulthood, and declining thereafter. Several properties of brain structure and function progress similarly across the lifespan. Cognitive and neuroscience research has approached aging primarily using associations between a few behaviors, brain functions, and structures. Because of this, the multivariate, global factors relating brain and behavior across the lifespan are not well understood. We investigated the global patterns of associations between 334 behavioral and clinical measures and 376 brain structural connections in 594 individuals across the lifespan. A single-axis associated changes in multiple behavioral domains and brain structural connections (r=0.5808). Individual variability within the single association axis well predicted the age of the subject (r=0.6275). Representational similarity analysis evidenced global patterns of interactions across multiple brain network systems and behavioral domains. Results show that global processes of human aging can be well captured by a multivariate data fusion approach.

    "abstract": "The mouse and macaque primary visual cortices are foundational models of cortical functioning, particularly at the level of single neurons. Therefore, detailing differences in how individual neurons connect across these species would inform models of cortical functioning and of how brains evolve. However, existing comparisons are limited, measuring synapse density without regard to where synapses are made or on what types of neurons. We use large volume electron microscopy to address this gap, reconstructing a total of 7735 synapses across 160 total neurons (146 excitatory, 14 inhibitory) from adult Rhesus macaque and mouse Layer 2/3 of primary visual cortex (V1). We find that primate connections are broadly sparse: primate excitatory and inhibitory neurons received 3-5 times fewer spine and somatic synapses with lower ratios of excitatory to inhibitory synapses than mouse equivalents. However, despite reductions in absolute synapse number, patterns of axonal innervation were preserved: inhibitory axons sparsely innervated neighboring excitatory neurons in macaque and mouse at similar rates and proportions. On the output side, most excitatory axons in mice myelinated close to the soma (81%) while most primate axons (68%) did not. Interestingly, primate axons, but not mouse axons, that myelinated had 3.3 fold more axon initial segment synapses than axons that did not myelinate, suggesting differential inhibitory control of long distance output in primate brains. Finally, we discover that when artificial recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are constrained by the metabolic cost of creating and maintaining synapses, increasing the number of nodes (e.g. neurons) as networks optimize for a cognitive task, reduces the number of connections per node, similar to primate neurons as compared to mice.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryUsing large volume serial electron microscopy, we show that primate cortical neural networks are sparser than mouse and using recursive neural nets, we show that energetic costs of synaptic maintenance could underlie this difference.",

    "abstract": "Histone modifications play an essential role in regulating recruitment of RNA polymerase II and through this regulation of transcription itself. Which modifications are essential for regulating the transcription of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) species and how these patterns differ between the different types of ncRNA remains less studied compared to mRNA. We performed a principal component analysis (PCA) of histone modifications patterns surrounding the transcription start site (TSS) of ncRNA in an attempt to understand how histone modifications predict polymerase recruitment and transcription of ncRNA in early C. elegans development We found that our first PCA axis was a better predictor of polymerase recruitment and expression than any single histone modification for ncRNA and miRNA. This indicates an integrated analysis of many histone modifications is essential for predicting expression based on histone modifications and that each ncRNA species have unique regulation of RNA polymerase recruitment through histone modifications.",
