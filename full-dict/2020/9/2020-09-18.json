    "abstract": "We introduce the Writhe Application Software Package (WASP) which can be used to characterise the topology of ribbon structures, the underlying mathematical model of DNA, Biopolymers, superfluid vorticies, elastic ropes and magnetic flux ropes. This characterisation is achieved by the general twist-writhe decomposition of both open and closed ribbons, in particular through a quantity termed the polar writhe. We demonstrate how this decomposition is far more natural and straightforward than artificial closure methods commonly utilized in DNA modelling. In particular, we demonstrate how the decomposition of the polar writhe in local and non-local components distinctly characterizes local helical structure and knotting/linking of the ribbon. This decomposition provides additional information not given by alternative approaches. As an example application, the WASP routines are used to characterise the evolving topology (writhe) of DNA minicircle and open ended plectoneme formation magnetic/optical tweezer simulations. Finally it is demonstrated that a number of well known alternative writhe expressions are actually simplifications of the polar writhe measure.",

    "abstract": "We have revised a previously reported multi-scale model for (ultra) small angle X-ray (USAXS/SAXS) and (very) small angle neutron scattering (VSANS/SANS) of live Escherichia coli based on compositional/metabolomic and ultrastructural constraints. The cellular body is modelled, as previously described, by an ellipsoid with multiple shells. However, scattering originating from flagella was substituted by a term accounting for the oligosaccharide cores of the lipopolysaccharide leaflet of the outer membrane including its cross-term with the cellular body. This was mainly motivated by (U)SAXS experiments showing indistinguishable scattering for bacteria in the presence and absence of flagella or fimbrae. The revised model succeeded in fitting USAXS/SAXS and differently contrasted VSANS/SANS data of E. coli ATCC 25922 over four orders of magnitude in length scale, providing specifically detailed insight into structural features of the cellular envelope, including the distance of the inner and outer membranes, as well as the scattering length densities of all bacterial compartments. Consecutively, the model was also successfully applied to E. coli K12, used for our original modelling, as well as for two other E. coli strains, detecting significant differences between the different strains in terms of bacterial size, intermembrane distance and its positional fluctuations. These findings corroborate the general applicability of our approach to quantitatively study the effect of bactericidal compounds on ultrastructural features of Gram-negative bacteria without the need to resort to any invasive staining or labelling agents.",

One such lncRNA mrhl, reported by our group, was found to be a regulator of SOX8, Wnt-signalling along with an important role in embryonic development in mouse. Recently, its human homolog, human mrhl (Hmrhl) was uncovered and study revealed its differential expression in several type of cancers, notably leukemia. In the present study, we further characterize molecular features of lncRNA Hmrhl and gain insight into its functional role in leukemia by gene silencing and transcriptome-based studies. Results indicate its high expression in CML patient samples as well as in K562 cell line. Silencing experiments suggest role of Hmrhl in cell proliferation, migration & invasion in K562 cells. RNA-seq and ChiRP-seq data analysis further revealed its association with important biological processes, including perturbed expression of crucial TFs and cancer-related genes. Among them ZIC1, PDGRF{beta} and TP53 were identified as regulatory targets, with high possibility of triplex formation by Hmrhl at their promoter site. In addition, we also found TAL-1 to be a potential regulator of Hmrhl expression in K562 cells. Thus, we hypothesize that Hmrhl lncRNA may play a significant role in the pathobiology of CML.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo understand the underlying pathways that promote cardiotoxicity following chemotherapy.\n\nBackgroundAnthracyclines are associated with cardiotoxicity which could be potentiated with use of complementary agents (like anti-ERBB2 inhibitors) which together afford robust anti-neoplastic effects. Anthracyclines lead to oxidative stress and thought to induce cardiotoxicity. However, interventions reducing oxidative stress in patients have been unsuccessful suggesting mechanisms beyond oxidative stress. Despite {beta}-adrenergic receptors ({beta}ARs) being key regulators of cardiac function, nothing is known about their role in chemotherapy-mediated cardiotoxicity.\n\nMethods{beta}1 and/or {beta}2-AR density was assessed in end-stage human heart failure patient samples either due to anthracycline cardiotoxicity or non-anthracycline dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Since ERBB2 inhibition is integral to overall chemotherapeutic arsenal, we assessed {beta}1- and/or {beta}2-AR density, cardiac function by echocardiography and immunohistochemistry in mice following ERBB2-specific inhibitor AG825.\n\nResultsSelective increase in cardiac {beta}1AR density is observed in end-stage human heart failure patient samples due to anthracycline cardiotoxicity as well as in ERBB2 inhibitor-treated mice.\n\nConclusionsElevated {beta}1AR density may be the key common underlying mechanism which is altered in response to chemotherapy promoting cardiac dilation of otherwise healthy hearts.\n\nHighlightsIn contrast to downregulation of {beta}1-adrenergic receptors ({beta}1AR) in end-stage human heart failure, anthracycline cardiotoxicity-mediated failure is associated with selective increase in {beta}1AR density.\n\nERBB2 inhibitor (AG825) treatment in mice results in cardiac dilation and selective rise in {beta}1AR density showing that increased {beta}1AR density in the heart could be a common mechanism underlying cardiotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "Whether the antibacterial properties of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are simply due to the release of silver ions (Ag+) or, additionally, nanoparticle-specific effects, has been debated for over a decade. We used experimental evolution of the model environmental bacterium Pseudomonas putida to ask whether bacteria respond differently to Ag+ or AgNP treatment. We pre-evolved five cultures of strain KT2440 for 70 d without Ag to reduce confounding adaptations before dividing the fittest pre-evolved culture into five cultures each, evolving in the presence of low concentrations of Ag+, well-defined AgNPs or Ag-free controls for a further 75 d. The mutations in the Ag+ or AgNP evolved populations displayed different patterns that were statistically significant. The non-synonymous mutations in AgNP-treated populations were mostly associated with cell surface proteins, including cytoskeletal membrane protein (FtsZ), membrane sensor and regulator (EnvZ and GacS) and periplasmic protein (PP_2758). In contrast, Ag+ treatment selected for mutations linked to cytoplasmic proteins, including metal ion transporter (TauB) and those with metal binding domains (ThiL and PP_2397). These results suggest the existence of AgNP-specific effects, either caused by sustained delivery of Ag+ from AgNP-dissolution, more proximate delivery from cell-surface bound AgNPs, or by direct AgNP action on the cells outer membrane.\n\nOriginality-Significance StatementThe increasing use of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and their release into the environment may affect environmental microorganisms and their communities and evolution. It has long been debated whether the toxicity of AgNPs towards microorganisms is solely due to their dissolution into toxic Ag+ or whether distinct nanoparticle related toxicity exists. We set up an evolution experiment to explore the adaptation of the environmental model bacterium Pseudomonas putida to Ag+ versus AgNP stress in order to elucidate the potentially different toxicity mechanisms of ionic and nanoparticulate Ag. We found novel mutations and distinct mutation patterns under Ag+ and AgNP treatment by whole genome sequencing. Our work highlights the association of the mutations selected by Ag+ stress with metal ion metabolism inside the cells and the mutations specific to AgNP stress with the cells surface. The finding that P. putida cells evolved in different directions under selection by Ag+ and AgNPs demonstrates a need for assessing the toxicity of nanomaterials separately in any environmental risk assessments.",

    "abstract": "Autoantibodies recognizing human {beta}1ARs generated due to dysregulation in autoimmune response are generally associated with deleterious cardiac outcomes. However, cellular studies show that isolates of {beta}1AR autoantibody from patients differentially modulate {beta}1AR function. {beta}1AR autoantibodies belong to the IgG class of immunoglobulins, however it is not known whether the IgG sub-classes mediate variability in {beta}1AR responses. To determine whether the IgG3 subclass of {beta}1AR autoantibodies uniquely modulate {beta}1AR function, HEK293 cells stably expressing human {beta}1ARs were utilized. Treatment of cells with IgG3(-) serum resulted in significant increase of cAMP compared to IgG3(+) serum. Pre-treatment of cells with IgG3(+) serum impaired dobutamine-mediated Adenylate Cyclase (AC) activity and cAMP generation whereas, it surprisingly increased AC activity and cAMP generation with {beta}-blocker metoprolol. Consistently, purified IgG3(+) {beta}1AR autoantibodies impaired dobutamine-mediated cAMP while elevating metoprolol-mediated AC activity and cAMP. Despite IgG3(+) autoantibodies reducing cAMP response to dobutamine, they mediate significant ERK activation upon dobutamine. IgG3(+) {beta}1AR autoantibodies did not alter {beta}2AR function, reflecting their specificity. The study shows that IgG3(+) {beta}1AR autoantibody impairs agonist-mediated G-protein coupling while preferentially mediating G-protein-independent ERK activation. Furthermore, it uniquely biases {beta}-blocker towards G-protein coupling. This unique biasing capabilities of IgG3(+) {beta}1AR autoantibodies may underlie the beneficial outcomes in patients.",

In this work, an arginine containing region in the second C2 domain of synaptotagmin 1 (C2B) is shown to control the expansion of the fusion pore and thereby the concentration of neurotransmitter released. This arginine apex, which is opposite the Ca2+ binding sites, interacts with membranes or membrane reconstituted SNAREs; however, only the membrane interactions occur under the conditions in which fusion takes place. Other regions of C2B influence the probably and kinetics of fusion but do not control the expansion of the fusion pore. These data indicate that the C2B domain has at least two distinct molecular roles in the fusion event, and the data are consistent with a novel model where the arginine apex of C2B positions the domain at the curved membrane surface of the expanding fusion pore.",

Recently, this circuit has been shown to comprise a hippocampal output recipient layer Vb and a cortical projecting layer Va. With the use of in vitro electrophysiology in transgenic mice specific for layer Vb, we assessed the presence of the thus necessary connection from layer Vb-to-Va in the functionally distinct medial (MEC) and lateral (LEC) subdivisions; MEC, particularly its dorsal part, processes allocentric spatial information, whereas the corresponding part of LEC processes information representing elements of episodes. Using identical experimental approaches, we show that connections from layer Vb-to-Va neurons are more effective in LEC compared with dorsal MEC. This indicates that the hippocampal-cortex output circuit is more effective in LEC, suggesting that episodic systems-consolidation may use LEC-derived information more than allocentric spatial information from MEC.",

    "abstract": "Successful pregnancy in placental mammals substantially depends on the establishment of maternal immune tolerance to the semi-allogenic fetus. Disorders in this process are tightly associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes including recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA). However, an in-depth understanding of the disorders from the aspect of systematic and decidual immune environment in RSA remains largely lacking. In this study, we utilized single-cell RNA-sequencing to comparably analyze the cellular and molecular signatures of decidual and peripheral leukocytes in normal and RSA pregnancies at the early stage of gestation. Integrative analysis identified 22 distinct cell clusters in total, and a dramatic difference in leukocyte subsets and molecular properties in RSA cases was revealed. Specifically, the cytotoxic properties of CD8T effector, NK, and MAIT cells in peripheral blood indicated apparently enhanced immune inflammatory status, and the subpopulation proportions and ligand-receptor interactions of the decidual leukocyte subsets demonstrated preferential immune activation in RSA patients. The molecular features, spatial distribution and the developmental trajectories of five decidual NK (dNK) subsets were illustrated. The proportion of a dNK subset responsible for fetal protection was reduced, while the ratio of another dNK subset with cytotoxic and immune-active signature was significantly increased. Notably, a unique pro-inflammatory CD56+CD16+ dNK subpopulation was substantially accumulated in RSA decidua. These findings reveal a comprehensive cellular and molecular atlas of decidual and peripheral leukocytes in human early pregnancy, which provides an in-depth insight into the immune pathogenesis for early pregnancy loss.",

Many different viral and bacterial pathogens can cause meningitis, with differences in mortality rates, risk of developing neurological sequelae and treatment options.

The results revealed a drastic and pathogen-type specific influx of tissue-, cell- and plasma proteins in the CSF, where in particular a large increase of neutrophil derived proteins in the CSF correlated with acute bacterial meningitis. Additionally, both acute bacterial and viral meningitis result in marked reduction of brain-enriched proteins. Generation of a multi-protein LASSO regression model resulted in an 18-protein panel of cell and tissue associated proteins capable of classifying acute bacterial meningitis and viral meningitis. The same protein panel also enabled classification of tick-borne encephalitis, a subgroup of viral meningitis, with high sensitivity and specificity. The work provides insights into pathogen specific host response patterns in CSF from different disease etiologies to support future classification of pathogen-type based on host response patterns in meningitis.",

    "abstract": "Resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam (TZP) in Escherichia coli has predominantly been associated with mechanisms that confer resistance to third generation cephalosporins. Recent reports have identified E. coli strains with phenotypic resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam but susceptibility to third generation cephalosporins (TZP-R/3GC-S). In this study we sought to determine the genetic diversity of this phenotype in E. coli (n = 58) isolated between 2014-2017 at a single tertiary hospital in Liverpool, UK, as well as the associated resistance mechanisms. We compare our findings to a UK-wide collection of invasive E. coli isolates (n = 1509) with publicly available phenotypic and genotypic data. These data sets included the TZP-R/3GC-S phenotype (n = 68), a piperacillin/tazobactam and third generation cephalosporin-susceptible (TZP-S/3GC-S, n = 1271) phenotypes. The TZP-R/3GC-S phenotype was displayed in a broad range of sequence types which was mirrored in the same phenotype from the UK-wide collection, and the overall diversity of invasive E. coli isolates. The TZP-R/3GC-S isolates contained a diverse range of plasmids, indicating multiple acquisition events of TZP resistance mechanisms rather than clonal expansion of a particular plasmid or sequence type. The putative resistance mechanisms were equally diverse, including hyperproduction of TEM-1, either via strong promoters or gene amplification, carriage of inhibitor resistant {beta}-lactamases, and an S133G b/aCTX-M-15 mutation detected for the first time in clinical isolates. Several of these mechanisms were present at a lower abundance in the TZP-S/3GC-S isolates from the UK-wide collection, but without the associated phenotypic resistance to TZP. Our findings highlight the complexity of this cryptic phenotype and the need for continued phenotypic monitoring, as well as further investigation to improve detection and prediction of the TZP-R/3GC-S phenotype from genomic data.",

    "abstract": "Septoria tritici blotch (STB), caused by the fungus Zymoseptoria tritici, is one of the most economically important diseases of wheat. Recently, both factors of a gene-for-gene interaction between Z. tritici and wheat, the wheat receptor-like kinase Stb6 and the Z. tritici secreted effector protein AvrStb6, have been identified. Previous analyses revealed a high diversity of AvrStb6 alleles present in historic Z. tritici isolate collections, with up to ~ 18% of analysed isolates possessing the avirulence isoform of AvrStb6 identical to that originally identified in the reference isolate IPO323. With Stb6 present in many commercial wheat cultivars globally, we aimed to assess potential changes in AvrStb6 genetic diversity and the incidence of alleles allowing evasion of Stb6-mediated resistance in more recent Z. tritici populations. Here we show, using targeted re-sequencing of AvrStb6, that this gene is universally present in field isolates sampled from major wheat-growing regions of the world between 2013-2017. However, in contrast to the data from studies of historic isolates, our study revealed a complete absence of the originally described avirulence isoform of AvrStb6 amongst modern Z. tritici isolates. Moreover, a remarkably small number of alleles, each encoding AvrStb6 protein isoforms conditioning virulence on Stb6-containing wheat, were found to predominate among modern Z. tritici isolates. A single virulence isoform of AvrStb6 was found to be particularly abundant throughout the global population. These findings indicate that, despite the ability of Z. tritici to sexually reproduce on resistant hosts, AvrStb6 avirulence alleles tend to be eliminated in subsequent populations.",

    "abstract": "Archaea of the order Methanomassiliicoccales use methylated-amines such as trimethylamine as a substrate for methane production. They form two large phylogenetic clades and reside in diverse environments, from soil to the human gut. Two genera, one from each clade, inhabit the human gut: Methanomassiliicoccus, which has one cultured representative, and \"candidatus Methanomethylophilus\", which has none. Questions remain regarding their distribution across different biomes and human populations, their association with other taxa in the human gut, and whether host genetics correlate with their abundance. To gain insight into the Methanomassiliicoccales, and the human-associated members in particular, we performed a genomic comparison of 72 Methanomassiliicoccales genomes and assessed their presence in metagenomes derived from the human gut (n=4472 representing 25 populations), nonhuman animal gut (n=145) and nonhost environments (n=160). Our analyses showed that all taxa are generalists: they were detected in animal gut and environmental samples. We confirmed two large clades, one enriched in the gut, the other enriched in the environment, with notable exceptions. Genomic adaptations to the gut include genome reduction, a set of adhesion factors distinct from that of environmental taxa, and genes involved in the shikimate pathway and bile resistance. Genomic adaptations differed by clade, not habitat preference, indicating convergent evolution between the clades. In the human gut, the relative abundance of Methanomassiliicoccales correlated with trimethylamine-producing bacteria and was unrelated to host genotype. Our results shed light on the microbial ecology of this group may help guide Methanomassiliicoccales-based strategies for trimethylamine mitigation in cardiovascular disease.\n\nImportanceMethanomassiliicoccales are a lesser known component of the human gut microbiota. This archaeal order is composed of methane producers that use methylated amines, such as trimethylamine, in methane production. This group has only one cultured representative; how they adapted to inhabit the mammalian gut and how they interact with other microbes is largely unknown. Using bioinformatics methods applied to DNA from a wide range of samples, we profiled the relative abundances of these archaea in environmental and host-associated microbial communities. We observed two groups of Methanomassiliicoccales, one largely host-associated and one largely found in environmental samples, with some exceptions. When host-associated, these archaea have a distinct set of genes related to adhesion and possess genes related to bile resistance. We did not detect Methanomassiliicoccales in all human populations tested but when present, they are correlated with Bacteria known to produce trimethylamine. Since trimethylamine is linked to cardiovascular disease risk, these intriguing Archaea may also be involved.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundColorectal cancer, one of the most common malignancies worldwide, is associated with a high mortality rate, mainly caused by metastasis. Comparative metagenome-wide analyses between healthy individuals and cancer patients suggest a role for the human intestinal microbiota. Nevertheless, which microbial molecules are involved in this communication is largely unknown, with current studies mainly focusing on short chain fatty acids and amino acid metabolites as potential mediators. However, quorum sensing peptides are not yet considered in this microbiome-host interaction: their in vivo presence nor any in vivo host-effect have been reported.\n\nResultsFor the first time, we showed that a quorum sensing peptide metabolite, EntF* produced by intestinal microbiota (E. faecium), is present in the blood circulation of mice. Moreover, it significantly promotes colorectal cancer metastasis in vivo, with metastatic lesions found in both liver and lung tissues, using an orthotopic mice model evaluating bioluminescence as well as macroscopic and microscopic presence of metastatic tumour nodules. In vitro tests on E-cadherin expression levels thereby indicated that the first, second, sixth and tenth amino acid of EntF* were critical for the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) effect, responsible for tumour metastasis.\n\nConclusionThis paper adds a new group of molecules, the quorum sensing peptides, as an additional causative factor explaining the microbiome-host interaction. The presence of a selected quorum sensing peptide (metabolite) in the mouse was proven for the first time and its in vivo effect on colorectal metastasis was demonstrated. We anticipate our in vivo results to be a starting point for broader microbiome-health investigations, not only limited to colorectal cancer metastasis, but also for developing novel bio-therapeutics in other disease areas, giving due attention to the QSP produced by the microbiome.",

The G-protein coupled receptor 56 (Gpr56) is the most highly-upregulated receptor gene in cells that take on hematopoietic fate and it is expressed by adult bone marrow HSCs. Although Gpr56 is required for hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HS/PC) generation in zebrafish embryos, its function in mammalian hematopoiesis remains unclear. Here we examine the role of Gpr56 in HS/PC development in Gpr56 conditional knockout (cKO) mouse embryos and Gpr knockout (KO) embryonic stem cell (ESC) hematopoietic differentiation cultures. Our results show a myeloid bias of Gpr56 cKO fetal liver HSCs and an increased definitive myeloid progenitor cell frequency in Gpr56KO ESC differentiation cultures. Surprisingly, we find that mouse Gpr97 rescues Gpr56 morphant zebrafish hematopoietic generation, and that Gpr97 expression is upregulated in mouse Gpr56 deletion models. When both Gpr56 and Gpr97 are deleted in ESCs, no/few HS/PCs are generated upon ESC differentiation. Together, our results reveal novel and redundant functions for these two G-protein coupled receptors in normal mammalian hematopoietic cell development and differentiation.",

    "abstract": "It is a mystery about sex determination and sexual plasticity in species without sex chromosomes. DNA methylation is a prevalent epigenetic modification in vertebrates, which has been shown to involve in the regulation of gene expression and embryo development. However, it remains unclear about how DNA methylation regulates sexual development. To elucidate it, we used zebrafish to investigate DNA methylation reprogramming during juvenile germ cell development and adult female-to-male sex transition. We revealed that primordial germ cells (PGCs) undergo significant DNA methylation reprogramming during germline development and set to an oocyte/ovary-like pattern at 9 days post fertilization (9 dpf). When blocking DNMTs activity in juveniles after 9 dpf, the zebrafish preferably develops into females. We also show that Tet3 involves in PGC development. Notably, we find that DNA methylome reprogramming during adult zebrafish sex transition is similar to the reprogramming during the sex differentiation from 9 dpf PGCs to sperm. Furthermore, inhibiting DNMTs activity can prevent the female-to-male sex transition, suggesting that methylation reprogramming is required for zebrafish sex transition. In summary, DNA methylation plays important roles in zebrafish germline development and sexual plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Growth in individual size or biomass is a key demographic component in population models, with wide-ranging applications from quantifying species performance across abiotic or biotic conditions to assessing landscape-level dynamics under global change. In forest ecology, the responses of tree growth to biotic interactions are widely held to be crucial for understanding forest diversity, function, and structure. To date, most studies on plant-plant interactions only examine the additive competitive or facilitative interactions between species pairs; however, there is increasing evidence of non-additive, higher-order interactions (HOIs) impacting species demographic rates. When HOIs are present, the dynamics of a multi-species community cannot be fully understood or accurately predicted solely from pairwise outcomes because of how additional species  interfere with the direct, pairwise interactions. Such HOIs should be particularly prevalent where species show nonlinear functional responses to resource availability and resource-acquisition traits themselves are density dependent. With this in mind, we used data from a tropical secondary forest--a system that fulfills both of these conditions--to build a ontogenetic diameter-growth model for individuals across ten woody-plant species. We allowed both direct and indirect interactions within communities to influence the species-specific growth parameters in a generalized Lotka-Volterra model. Specifically, indirect interactions entered the model as higher-order quadratic terms, i.e. non-additive effects of conspecific and heterospecific neighbour size on the focal individuals growth. For the whole community and for four out of ten focal species, the model that included HOIs had more statistical support than the model that included only direct interactions, despite the former containing a far greater number of parameters. HOIs had comparable effect sizes to direct interactions, and tended to further reduce the diameter growth rates of most species beyond what direct interactions had already reduced. In a simulation of successional stand dynamics, the inclusion of HOIs lead to rank swaps in species diameter hierarchies, even when community-level size distributions remained qualitatively similar. Our study highlights the implications, and discusses possible mechanisms, of non-additive density dependence in highly diverse and light-competitive tropical forests.",

    "abstract": "Modern agricultural practices and the climate change foster the rapid spread of plant pathogens like the maize fungal pathogen Setosphaeria turcica, which causes Northern corn leaf blight and expanded into Central Europe since the 1980s. To investigate the rapid expansion of S. turcica we sequenced 121 isolates from Europe and Kenya. Population genomic inference revealed a single genetically diverse cluster in Kenya and three clonal lineages with low diversity and one cluster of multiple clonal sublineages in Europe. Phylogenetic dating suggests that all European lineages originated by sexual reproduction outside Europe and subsequently were subsequently introgressed multiple times. In contrast to Kenyan isolates, European isolates did not show sexual recombination despite the presence of both MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 mating types. Coalescent analysis of the geographically most widespread European lineage supported a neutral, strongly exponential population growth model over models with natural selection caused by host defence resistance or environmental adaptation. Within clonal lineages, we observed phenotypic variation in virulence to different monogenic resistances that may originate from repeated mutations in virulence genes. Association mapping between genetic clusters did not identify genomic regions associated with pathogen races but uncovered strongly differentiated genomic regions between clonal lineages that harbor putative effector genes. In conclusion, the expansion and population growth of S. turcica in Europe was mainly driven by the expansion of maize cultivation area and not by rapid adaptation.\n\nSignificance statementThe geographic expansion and plant pathogens caused by modern agricultural practices and climate change is a major problem in modern agriculture. We investigated the rapid spread of the maize fungal pathogen Setosphaeria turcica by whole genome sequencing of isolates from Kenya and Europe and demonstrated that the rapid expansion in Central Europe since the 1980s mainly reflects the rapid growth of the maize cultivation area in this region and not a rapid adaptation to resistant maize varieties. Our analyses show that by monitoring whole genome sequence diversity of plant pathogens and their invasion history, agricultural management and breeding strategies can be developed to control the evolution and future spread of plant pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Pyrimethamine was first introduced for the treatment of malaria in Asia and Africa during the early 1980s, replacing chloroquine, and has become the first line of drugs in many countries. In recent years, development of pyrimethamine resistance in Plasmodium vivax has become a barrier to effective malaria control strategies. Here, we describe the use of meta-barcoded deep amplicon sequencing technology to assess the evolutionary origin of pyrimethamine resistance by analysing the flanking region of dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) locus. The genetic modelling suggests that 58R and 173L single mutants and 58R/117N double mutants are present on a single lineage; suggesting a single origin of these mutations. The triple mutants (57L/58R/117N, 58R/61M/117N and 58R/117N/173L) share the lineage of 58R/117N, suggesting a common origin. In contrast, the 117N mutant is present on two separate lineages suggesting that there are multiple origins of this mutation. We characterised the allele frequency of the P. vivax dhfr locus. Our results support the view that the single mutation of 117N and double mutations of 58R/117N arise commonly, whereas the single mutation of 173L and triple mutations of 57L/58R/117N, 58R/61M/117N and 58R/117N/173L are less common. Our work will help to inform mitigation strategies for pyrimethamine resistance in P. vivax.",

    "abstract": "The rate of translation can vary considerably depending on the mRNA template. During the elongation phase the ribosome can transiently pause or permanently stall. A pause can provide the nascent protein with the required time to fold or be transported, while stalling can serve as quality control and trigger degradation of aberrant mRNA and peptide. Ribosome profiling has allowed for the genome-wide detection of such pause and stall sites, but due to library-specific biases, these predictions are often unreliable.\n\nHere, we address this by taking advantage of the deep conservation of the protein synthesis machinery, hypothesizing that similar conservation could exist for functionally important positions of ribosome slowdown - here collectively called stall sites. We analyze multiple ribosome profiling datasets from a phylogenetically diverse group of eukaryotes: yeast, fruit fly, zebrafish, mouse, and human and identify conserved stall sites. We find thousands of stall sites across multiple species, with proline, glycine, and negatively charged amino acids being the main facilitators of stalling. Many of the sites are found in RNA processing genes, suggesting that stalling might have a conserved regulatory effect on RNA metabolism. In summary, our results provide a rich resource for the study of conserved stalling and indicate possible roles of stalling in gene regulation.",

    "abstract": "Strategies for investigating and optimising the expression and folding of proteins for biotechnological and pharmaceutical purposes are in high demand. Here, we describe a dual-reporter biosensor system that simultaneously assesses in vivo protein translation and protein folding, thereby enabling rapid screening of mutant libraries. We have validated the dual-reporter system on five different proteins and find an excellent correlation between reporter intensity signals and the levels of protein expression and solubility of the proteins. We further demonstrate the applicability of the dual-reporter system as a screening assay for deep mutational scanning experiments. The system enables high throughput selection of protein variants with high expression levels and altered protein stability. Next generation sequencing analysis of the resulting libraries of protein variants show a good correlation between computationally predicted and experimentally determined protein stabilities. We furthermore show that the mutational experimental data obtained using this system may be useful for protein structure calculations.",

    "abstract": "The histidine-rich Ca2+-binding protein (HRC) stimulates the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) to increase Ca2+-uptake into the lumen. HRC also binds the triadin scaffold in a Ca2+-dependent manner, and HRC tunes both the uptake and release of Ca2+ depending on the concentration in the intracellular Ca2+-stores. We investigated how HRC stimulates SERCA pumping using biochemical and biophysical assays, and show that HRC is an intrinsically disordered protein that binds directly to SERCA via electrostatic interactions. The affinity of the interaction depends on the conformation of SERCA, and HRC binds most tightly in the calcium-released E2P state. This state marks the end of the rate-limiting [Ca2]E1P to E2P transition of SERCA, and suggests that HRC stimulates SERCA by preferentially stabilizing the end point of this transition. HRC remains disordered in the bound state and thus binds in a dynamic, fuzzy complex. The binding of HRC to SERCA shows that fuzzy complexes formed by disordered proteins may be conformation-specific, and use this specificity to modulate the functional cycle of complex molecular machines such as a P-type ATPase.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial disease is a debilitating condition with a diverse genetic aetiology. Here, we report that TMEM126A, a protein that is mutated in patients with autosomal recessive optic atrophy, participates directly in the assembly of mitochondrial complex I. Using a combination of genome editing, interaction studies and quantitative proteomics, we find that loss of TMEM126A results in an isolated complex I deficiency and that TMEM126A interacts with a number of complex I subunits and assembly factors. Pulse-labelling interaction studies reveal that TMEM126A associates with the newly synthesised mtDNA-encoded ND4 subunit of complex I. Our findings indicate that TMEM126A is involved in the assembly of the ND4 distal membrane module of complex I. Importantly, we clarify that the function of TMEM126A is distinct from its paralogue TMEM126B, which acts in assembly of the ND2-module of complex I, helping to explain the differences in disease aetiology observed between these two genes.",

    "abstract": "Ischemia/hypoxia is major underlying cause for heart failure and stroke. Although beta-adrenergic receptor ({beta}AR) is phosphorylated in response to hypoxia, less is known about the underlying mechanisms. Hypoxia results in robust GRK2-mediated {beta}2AR phosphorylation but does not cause receptor internalization. However, hypoxia leads to significant endosomal-{beta}2AR phosphorylation accompanied by inhibition of {beta}2AR-associated protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity impairing resensitization. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase {gamma} (PI3K{gamma}) impedes resensitization by phosphorylating endogenous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A, I2PP2A that inhibits PP2A activity. Hypoxia increased PI3K{gamma} activity leading to significant phosphorylation of I2PP2A resulting in inhibition of PP2A and consequently resensitization. Surprisingly, {beta}-blocker abrogated hypoxia-mediated {beta}2AR phosphorylation instead of phosphorylation in normoxia. Subjecting mice to hypoxia leads to significant cardiac dysfunction and {beta}2AR phosphorylation showing conservation of non-canonical hypoxia-mediated pathway in vivo. These findings provide mechanistic insights on hypoxia-mediated {beta}AR dysfunction which is rescued by {beta}-blocker and will have significant implications in heart failure and stroke.",

    "abstract": "Post-operative infection is a major complication in patients recovering from orthopaedic surgery. As such, there is a clinical need to develop biomaterials for use in regenerative surgery that can promote mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) osteospecific differentiation and that can prevent infection caused by biofilm-forming pathogens. Nanotopographical approaches to pathogen control are being identified, including in orthopaedic materials such as titanium and its alloys. These topographies use high aspect ratio nanospikes or nanowires to prevent bacterial adhesion but these features puncture adhering cells, thus also reducing MSC adhesion. Here, we use a poly(ethyl acrylate) (PEA) polymer coating on titanium nanowires to spontaneously organise fibronectin (FN) and to deliver bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) to enhance MSC adhesion and osteospecific signalling. This nanotopography when combined with the PEA coating enhanced osteogenesis and reduced adhesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in culture. Using a novel MSC-Pseudomonas aeruginosa co-culture, we also show that the coated nanotopographies protect MSCs from cytotoxic quorum sensing and signalling molecules. We conclude that the PEA polymer-coated nanotopography can both support MSCs and prevent pathogens from adhering to a biomaterial surface, thus protecting from biofilm formation and bacterial infection and supporting osteogenic repair.",

    "abstract": "Mammographic screening for breast cancer is unable to distinguish molecular differences between hydroxyapatite (HA) microcalcifications (cals) that are associated with malignancy and calcium oxalate (CaOx) cals that are benign. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate quantitative material decomposition of model breast cals of clinically-relevant composition and size using spectral photon-counting computed tomography (PCCT). Model cals composed of HA, CaOx, and dicalcium phosphate (DCP) were treated as materials containing spatially coincident elemental compositions of calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), and oxygen (O). Elemental decomposition was performed using constrained maximum-likelihood estimation in the image domain. Images were acquired with a commercial, preclinical PCCT system (MARS Bioimaging) with five energy bins selected to maximize counts at low photon energies and spectral differences between Ca and P. Elemental concentrations of Ca and P within the each cal composition were accurately identified and quantified with a root-mean-squared error < 12%. HA and CaOx cals, < 1 mm is size, were accurately discriminated by the measured P content with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) > 0.9. The mole fraction of P, P/(Ca+P), was able to discriminate all three cal compositions with AUC > 0.8 for cals < 1 mm is size and AUC = 1 for cals > 2 mm in size. The overall accuracy for the classification of cal types and quantification of P was robust against different assumptions in the elemental decomposition calibration, but quantification of Ca was improved with assumptions that most accurately accounted for the molar volume of each element within cal compositions. Thus, PCCT enabled quantitative molecular imaging of breast cal composition, which is not possible with current clinical molecular imaging modalities.",

    "abstract": "Uncovering the general principles that govern the architecture of metabolic networks is key to understanding the emergence and evolution of living systems. Artificial chemistries, in silico representations of chemical reaction networks arising from a defined set of mathematical rules, can help address this challenge by enabling the exploration of alternative chemical universes and the possible metabolic networks that could emerge within them. Here we focus on artificial chemistries in which strings of characters represent simplified molecules, and string concatenation and splitting represent possible chemical reactions. We study string chemistries using tools borrowed from the field of stoichiometric constraint-based modeling of organismal metabolic networks, through a novel Python package, ARtificial CHemistry NEtwork Toolbox (ARCHNET). In addition to exploring the complexity and connectivity properties of different string chemistries, we developed a network-pruning algorithm that can generate minimal metabolic networks capable of producing a specified set of biomass precursors from a given assortment of environmental molecules within the string chemistry framework. We found that the identities of the metabolites in the biomass reaction wield much more influence over the structure of the minimal metabolic networks than the identities of the nutrient metabolites -- a notion that could help us better understand the rise and evolution of biochemical organization. Our work provides a bridge between artificial chemistries and stoichiometric modeling, which can help address a broad range of open questions, from the spontaneous emergence of an organized metabolism to the structure of microbial communities.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has led to an explosion in novel methods to study biological variation among individual cells, and to classify cells into functional and biologically meaningful categories. Here, we present a new cell type projection tool, HieRFIT (Hierarchical Random Forest for Information Transfer), based on hierarchical random forests. HieRFIT uses a priori information about cell type relationships to improve classification accuracy, taking as input a hierarchical tree structure representing the class relationships, along with the reference data. We use an ensemble approach combining multiple random forest models, organized in a hierarchical decision tree structure. We show that our hierarchical classification approach improves accuracy and reduces incorrect predictions especially for inter-dataset tasks which reflect real life applications. We use a scoring scheme that adjusts probability distributions for candidate class labels and resolves uncertainties while avoiding the assignment of cells to incorrect types by labeling cells at internal nodes of the hierarchy when necessary. Using HieRFIT, we re-analyzed publicly available scRNA-seq datasets showing its effectiveness in cell type cross-projections with inter/intra-species examples. HieRFIT is implemented as an R package and it is available at (https://github.com/yasinkaymaz/HieRFIT/releases/tag/v1.0.0)",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDLiver fibrosis progressing to liver cirrhosis and hepatic carcinoma is very common and causes more than one million deaths annually. Fibrosis develops from recurrent liver injury but the molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Recently, the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4-MyD88 signalling pathway has been reported to contribute to fibrosis. Extracellular histones are the ligands of TLR4 but their roles in liver fibrosis have not been investigated.\n\nAIMThis study aims to investigate the roles and potential mechanisms of extracellular histones in liver fibrosis.\n\nMETHODSIn vitro, the LX2 cells, a human hepatic stellate cell (HSC) line, were treated with histones in the presence or absence of non-anticoagulant heparin (NAHP) for neutralising histones or TLR4-blocking antibody. The cells resultant expression of collagen I was detected using Western blotting and immunofluorescent staining. In vivo, the CCl4-induced liver fibrosis model was generated in male 6 week old ICR mice and in TLR4 or MyD88 knockout and parental mice. Circulating histones were detected and the effect of NAHP was evaluated.\n\nRESULTSExtracellular histones strongly stimulated LX2 cells to produce collagen I. The histone-enhanced collagen expression was significantly reduced by NAHP and TLR4 blocking antibody. In CCl4-treated wild type mice, circulating histones were dramatically increased and maintained high levels during the whole course of fibrosis-induction. Injection of NAHP not only reduced alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and liver injury scores, but also significantly reduced fibrogenesis. Since the TLR4-blocking antibody reduced histone-enhanced collagen I production in HSC, the CCl4 model with TLR-4 and MyD88 knockout mice was used to demonstrate the roles of the TLR4-MyD88 signalling pathway in CCl4-induced liver fibrosis. The levels of liver fibrosis were indeed significantly lower than in these knockout mice than the wild type parental mice.\n\nCONCLUSIONThis study demonstrated that extracellular histones are able to stimulate HSC to produce collagen I and TLR4 is involved in this process. The in vivo findings support the novel concept that high levels of circulating histones potentially stimulate TLR4 receptor to enhance fibrogenesis via the TLR4-MyD88 signalling pathway. NAHP detoxify extracellular histones and thus has a potential therapeutic role by reducing liver injury and fibrogenesis.\n\nCore tipThis work fills the gap between recurrent liver injury and liver fibrosis. When liver cells die, histones will be released. High levels of extracellular histones not only cause a secondary liver injury, but also activate the TLR4-MyD88 signalling pathway to enhance collagen I production and liver fibrosis. Binding of non-anticoagulant heparin (NAHP) to extracellular histones reduces histone toxicity, alleviates liver injury and prevent histones from activating the TLR4-MyD88 signalling pathway. These results may explain why NAHP reduces liver fibrosis in this animal model although further investigations are required.\n\nARTICLE HIGHLIGHTSO_ST_ABSResearch backgroundC_ST_ABSCurrently, the molecular mechanisms of liver fibrosis are not fully understood. Recurrent liver injury or inflammation initiate wound healing process along with fibrogenesis. However, what initiates this process is not clear. When cells die, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) will be released. Histones are the most abundant DAMP and are also the ligands for TLR4, which in turn has been demonstrated to be involved in bile duct ligation-induced liver fibrosis. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) has been proposed to be a ligand for TLR4. Since recurrent liver injury does not naturally produce LPS but abundant extracellular histones, this study sought to investigate the potential roles of extracellular histones as TLR4 ligands in liver fibrosis.\n\nResearch motivationSince our laboratory has been involved in studying the roles of DAMPs in critical illnesses, extracellular histones in liver fibrosis is of great interest in terms of biological and clinical significance.\n\nResearch objectivesOur study aimed to clarify the roles of extracellular histones in fibrogenesis in vitro and in vivo.\n\nResearch methodsIn our study, a HSC cell line and animal models of liver fibrosis were employed. Intervention studies with NAHP to detoxify histones and TLR4 blocking antibodies to inhibit TLR4 was performed. In addition, TLR4 and MyD88 knockout mice were used to support that the theory that the TLR4-MyD88 signalling pathway is involved in liver fibrosis in the CCl4 mouse model.\n\nResearch resultsO_LIDemonstrated that high levels of circulating histones exist when fibrosis is induced by CCl4 in the mouse model.\nC_LIO_LIDemonstrated in vitro that extracellular histones are able to stimulate HSC cells to produce collagen I.\nC_LIO_LIDemonstrated that NAHP is able to inhibit histone-enhanced collagen production in the HSC cell line, and reduce liver injury and fibrosis in the animal model.\nC_LIO_LIDemonstrated that TLR4 is involved in histone-enhanced collagen I production in HSC cells. In vivo, the TLR4-MyD88 signalling pathway was demonstrated to be involved in liver fibrosis, but whether circulating histones are the major activators of the pathway is not fully clear.\nC_LI\n\nResearch conclusionRecurrent liver injury releases extracellular histones which potentially activate TLR4-MyD88 signalling pathway to promote liver fibrosis. The ability of NAHP to detoxify circulating histones holds the potential for the treatment of liver injury and prevention of liver fibrosis.\n\nResearch perspectivesFuture studies demonstrating the contributions of circulating histones in activating the TLR4-MyD88 signalling pathway in vivo will validate their role in liver fibrosis. Development of better anti-histone reagents to reduce liver injury and prevent liver fibrosis will hold great potential in the management of diseases with recurrent liver injury.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian skin impacts metabolic efficiency system-wide, controlling the rate of heat loss and consequent heat production. Here we compare the unique fat depots associated with mouse and human skin, to determine whether they have corresponding function and regulation. For human, we assay a skin-associated fat (SAF) body-wide depot to distinguish it from the subcutaneous fat pads characteristic of abdomen and upper limbs. We show that the thickness of SAF is not related to general adiposity; it is much thicker (1.6-fold) in women than men, and highly subject-specific. We used molecular and cellular assays of {beta}-adrenergic induced lipolysis and found that dermal white adipose tissue (dWAT) in mice is resistant to lipolysis; in contrast, the body-wide human SAF depot becomes lipolytic, generating heat in response to {beta}-adrenergic stimulation. In mice challenged to make more heat to maintain body temperature (either environmentally or genetically), there is a compensatory increase in thickness of dWAT: A corresponding {beta}-adrenergic stimulation of human skin adipose (in vivo or in explant) depletes adipocyte lipid content. We summarize the regulation of skin-associated adipocytes by age, sex, and adiposity, for both species. We conclude that the body-wide dWAT depot of mice shows unique regulation that enables it to be deployed for heat preservation; combined with the actively lipolytic subcutaneous mammary fat pads they enable thermal defense. The adipose tissue that covers human subjects produces heat directly, providing an alternative to the brown adipose tissues.\n\nKEY POINTS SUMMARYO_LISeveral distinct strategies produce and conserve heat to maintain body temperature of mammals, each associated with unique physiologies, with consequence for wellness and disease susceptibility\nC_LIO_LIHighly regulated properties of skin offset the total requirement for heat production\nC_LIO_LIWe hypothesize that the adipose component of skin is primarily responsible for modulating heat flux; here we evaluate the relative regulation of adipose depots in mouse and human, to test their recruitment to heat production and conservation\nC_LIO_LIWe found that insulating mouse dermal white adipose tissue accumulates in response to environmentally- and genetically-induced cool stress; this layer is one of two adipose depots closely apposed to mouse skin, where the subcutaneous mammary gland fat pads are actively recruited to heat production\nC_LIO_LIIn contrast, the body-wide adipose depot associated with human skin produces heat directly, potentially creating an alternative to the centrally regulated brown adipose tissue\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1 alpha (PGC1) is known as a transcriptional co-activator in peripheral tissues but its function in the brain remains poorly understood. Various brain-specific Pgc1 isoforms have been reported in mice and humans, including transcripts derived from a novel promoter about [~]580 Kb upstream from the reference gene. These isoforms incorporate repetitive sequences from the simple sequence repeat (SSR) and short interspersed nuclear element (SINE) classes and are predicted to give rise to proteins with distinct amino-termini. In this study, we show that a SINE-containing isoform is the predominant form of Pgc1 expressed in neurons. We then generated a mouse carrying a mutation within the SINE to study its functional role in the brain. By combining genomics, biochemical and behavioural approaches, we show that this mutation leads to impaired motor coordination in females, but not male mice, associated with the upregulation of hundreds of cerebellar genes. Moreover, our analysis suggests that known nuclear receptors interact with this isoform of PGC1 in the brain to carry out the female transcriptional program. These data expand our knowledge on the role of Pgc1 in the brain and help explain its conflicting roles in neurological disease and behavioural outcomes.",

We found that parvalbumin-expressing basket cells as responsible for the feedforward inhibitory drive of SuM over area CA2. Inhibition recruited by the SuM input onto CA2 PNs increased the precision of action potential firing both in conditions of low and high cholinergic tone. Furthermore, SuM stimulation in area CA2 modulates CA1 activity, indicating that synchronized CA2 output drives a pulsed inhibition in area CA1. Hence, the network revealed here lays basis for understanding how SuM activity directly acts on the local hippocampal circuit to allow social memory encoding.",

    "abstract": "Sensory processing is essential for motor control. Climbing fibers from the inferior olive transmit sensory signals to Purkinje cells, but how the signals are represented in the cerebellar cortex remains elusive. We examined the olivocerebellar organization of the mouse brain by optically measuring complex spikes (CSs) evoked by climbing fiber inputs over the entire dorsal surface of the cerebellum. We discovered that the surface was divided into approximately 200 segments each composed of [~]100 Purkinje cells that fired CSs synchronously. Our in vivo imaging of evoked responses revealed that whereas stimulation of four limb muscles individually similar global CS responses across nearly all segments, the timing and location of a stimulus were derived by Bayesian inference from coordinated activation and inactivation of multiple segments on a single trial basis. Our findings suggest that the cerebellum performs segment-based distributed population coding by assembling probabilistic sensory representation in individual segments.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates in a joint action setting a well-established effect in speech production, cumulative semantic interference, an increase in naming latencies when naming a series of semantically related pictures. In a joint action setting, two task partners take turns naming pictures. Previous work in this setting demonstrated that naming latencies increase not only with each semantically related picture speakers named themselves, but also with each picture named by the partner (Hoedemaker, Ernst, Meyer, & Belke, 2017; Kuhlen & Abdel Rahman, 2017). This suggests that speakers pursue lexical access on behalf of their partner. In two electrophysiological experiments (N=30 each) we investigated the neuro-cognitive signatures of such simulated lexical access. As expected, in both experiments speakers naming latency increased with successive naming instances within a given semantic category. Correspondingly, speakers EEG showed an increasing posterior positivity between 250-400ms, an ERP modulation typically associated with lexical access. However, unlike previous experiments, speakers were not influenced by their partners picture naming. Accordingly, we found no electrophysiological evidence of lexical access. To reconcile these findings we pooled behavioral data from five experiments (N=144). Within this large sample we find empirical evidence for partner-elicited interference. Furthermore, our data suggests that speakers may be less affected by their partners naming response in settings with remotely located task partners (as in present experiments). We conclude that speakers do not always represent their partners naming response and that our experimental setting may have limited the participants evaluation of the task as a joint action.",

    "abstract": "The granular retrosplenial cortex (RSG) is critical for both spatial and non-spatial behaviors, but the underlying neural codes remain poorly understood. Here, we use optogenetic circuit mapping in mice to reveal a double dissociation that allows parallel circuits in superficial RSG to process disparate inputs. The anterior thalamus and dorsal subiculum, sources of spatial information, strongly and selectively recruit small low-rheobase (LR) pyramidal cells in RSG. In contrast, neighboring regular-spiking (RS) cells are preferentially controlled by claustral and anterior cingulate inputs, sources of mostly non-spatial information. Precise sublaminar axonal and dendritic arborization within RSG layer 1, in particular, permits this parallel processing. Observed thalamocortical synaptic dynamics enable computational models of LR neurons to compute the speed of head rotation, despite receiving head direction inputs that do not explicitly encode speed. Thus, parallel input streams identify a distinct principal neuronal subtype ideally positioned to support spatial orientation computations in the RSG.",

    "abstract": "The need to identify new therapeutic approaches to the treatment of cancers of the B lymphoid lineage is crucial. Unlike CRISPR/Cas technology, antisense strategies result in transient modifications of gene expression and lack mutagenic effects at the DNA level. Here, we provide evidence for efficient knockdown of c-REL and RELA expression after treatment with splice switching antisense oligonucleotides (SSO) inducing exon skipping and reading frameshifts. We also developed a tool to facilitate the choice of exons for on purpose inhibition of mouse and human gene expression. Interestingly, treatments with morpholino SSO targeting the c-REL exon 2 donor splice site or RELA exon 5 acceptor splice site elicited very efficient knockdown in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines and antibody-secreting cells derived from primary human B cells. Consistent with the clinical relevance of c-REL activation in DLBCLs, treatment with c-REL SSO induced major alterations in NF-{kappa}B and TNF signalling pathways and strongly decreased cell viability. Altogether, SSO-mediated knockdown is a powerful approach to transiently inhibit the expression of given genes in B-lineage cells that should pave the way for cancer treatments, provided optimized ligand-conjugations for in vivo delivery.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=169 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/302984v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@170de4forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@113229corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@145377forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13e8c1e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Bacterial efflux pumps are an important pathogenicity trait because they extrude a variety of xenobiotics. Our laboratory previously identified in silico Burkholderia collagen-like protein 8 (Bucl8) in the Tier one select agents Burkholderia pseudomallei and Burkholderia mallei. We hypothesize that Bucl8, which contains two predicted tandem outer membrane efflux pump domains, is a component of a putative efflux pump. Unique to Bucl8, as compared to other outer membrane proteins, is the presence of an extended extracellular region containing a collagen-like (CL) domain and a non-collagenous C-terminus (Ct). Molecular modeling and circular dichroism spectroscopy with a recombinant protein, corresponding to this extracellular CL-Ct portion of Bucl8, demonstrated that it adopts a collagen triple helix, whereas functional assays screening for Bucl8 ligands identified binding to fibrinogen. Bioinformatic analysis of the bucl8 gene locus revealed it resembles a classical efflux-pump operon. The bucl8 gene is co-localized with downstream fusCDE genes encoding fusaric acid (FA) resistance, and with an upstream gene, designated as fusR, encoding a LysR-type transcriptional regulator. Using RT-qPCR, we defined the boundaries and transcriptional organization of the fusR-bucl8-fusCDE operon. We found exogenous FA induced bucl8 transcription over 80-fold in B. pseudomallei, while deletion of the entire bucl8 locus decreased the MIC of FA 4-fold in its isogenic mutant. We furthermore showed that the Bucl8 pump expressed in the heterologous Escherichia coli host confers FA resistance. On the contrary, the Bucl8 pump did not confer resistance to a panel of clinically-relevant antimicrobials in Burkholderia and E. coli. We finally demonstrated that deletion of the bucl8-locus drastically affects the growth of the mutant in L-broth. We determined that Bucl8 is a component of a novel tetrapartite efflux pump, which confers FA resistance, fibrinogen binding, and optimal growth.\n\nAuthor SummaryBurkholderia pseudomallei and Burkholderia mallei are highly infectious and multidrug resistant bacteria that are classified by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases as Tier one select agents partly due to the intrinsic multidrug resistance associated with expression of the efflux pumps. To date, only few efflux pumps predicted in Burkholderia spp. have been studied in detail. In the current study we introduce Bucl8, an outer membrane component of an unreported putative efflux pump with a unique extended extracellular portion that forms a collagen triple helix and binds fibrinogen. We demonstrate Bucl8s role in fusaric acid resistance by defining its operon via bioinformatic and transcriptional analyses, as well as by employing loss-of-function and gain-of-function genetic approaches. Our studies also implicate the Bucl8-associated pump in metabolic and physiologic homeostasis. Understanding how Bucl8 efflux pump contributes to Burkholderia pathology will foster development of pump inhibitors targeting transport mechanism or identifying potential surface-exposed vaccine targets.",

    "abstract": "In contrast to the extensively studied rewiring of epigenetic and transcriptional programs required for cell reprogramming, the dynamics of post-transcriptional changes and their associated regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we have studied the dynamics of alternative splicing (AS) changes occurring during efficient reprogramming of mouse B cells into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. These changes, generally uncoupled from transcriptional regulation, significantly overlapped with splicing programs reported during reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Correlation between gene expression of potential regulators and specific clusters of AS changes enabled the identification and subsequent validation of CPSF3 and hnRNP UL1 as facilitators, and TIA1 as repressor of MEFs reprogramming. These RNA-binding proteins control partially overlapping programs of splicing regulation affecting genes involved in developmental and morphogenetic processes. Our results reveal common programs of splicing regulation during reprogramming of different cell types and identify three novel regulators of this process.",

Based on Arapaima gigas whole genome, available at the NCBI database (ID: 12404), a total of 95,098 unique perfect microsatellites were identified, including their proposed primers. From this panel, a multiplex system containing 12 tetranucleotide microsatellite markers was validated.

    "abstract": "Host cell proteins (HCPs) are process-related impurities derived from host organisms, which need to be controlled to ensure adequate product quality and safety. In this study, product quality attributes were tracked for several mAbs under the intended storage and accelerated stability conditions. One product quality attribute not expected to be stability indicating is the N-glycan heterogeneity profile. However, significant N-glycan degradation was observed for one mAbs under accelerated and stressed stability conditions. The root cause for this instability was attributed to Hexosaminidase B (HEXB), an enzyme known to remove terminal N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). HEXB was identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based proteomics approach to be enriched in the impacted stability batches from mAb-1. Subsequently, enzymatic and targeted multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) MS assays were developed to support process and product characterization. A potential interaction between HEXB and mAb-1 was initially observed from the analysis of process intermediates by proteomics among several mAbs and later supported by computational modeling. An improved bioprocess was developed to significantly reduce HEXB levels in the final drug substance. A risk assessment was conducted by evaluating the in silico immunogenicity risk and the impact on product quality. To the best of our knowledge, HEXB is the first residual HCP reported to have impact on the glycan profile of a formulated drug product. The combination of different analytical tools, mass spectrometry and computational modeling provide a general strategy on how to study residual HCP for biotherapeutics development.",

    "abstract": "Disinfection of treated wastewater in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is used to minimize emission of coliforms, pathogens, and antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) in the environment. However, the fate of free-floating extracellular DNA (eDNA) that do carry antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) is overlooked. Water technologies are central to urban and industrial ecology for sanitation and resource recovery. Biochar produced by pyrolysis of sewage sludge and iron-oxide-coated sands recovered as by-product of drinking water treatment were tested as adsorbents to remove ARGs and MGEs from WWTP effluent. DNA adsorption properties and materials applicability were studied in batch and up-flow column systems at bench scale. Breakthrough curves were measured with ultrapure water and treated wastewater at initial DNA concentrations of 0.1-0.5 mg mL-1 and flow rates of 0.1-0.5 mL min-1. Batch tests with treated wastewater indicated that the adsorption profiles of biochar and iron-oxide coated sand followed a Freundlich isotherm, suggesting a multilayer adsorption of nucleic acids. Sewage-sludge biochar exhibited higher DNA adsorption capacity (1 mg g-1) and longer saturation breakthrough times (4 to 10 times) than iron-oxide coated sand (0.2 mg g-1). The removal of a set of representative ARGs and MGEs was measured by qPCR comparing the inlet and outlet of the plug-flow column fed with treated wastewater. ARGs and MGEs present as free-floating eDNA were adsorbed by sewage-sludge biochar at 85% and iron-oxide coated sand at 54%. From the environmental DNA consisting of the free-floating extracellular DNA plus the intracellular DNA of the cells present in the effluent water, 97% (sewage-sludge biochar) and 66% (iron-oxide coated sand) of the tested genes present were removed. Sewage-sludge biochar displayed interesting properties to minimize the spread of antimicrobial resistances to the aquatic environment while strengthening the role of WWTPs as resource recovery factories.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=159 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/302018v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (48K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bdc78borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@177a537org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ffefdeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dd1457_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LISewage-sludge biochar and iron oxide coated sands were tested to adsorb DNA and cells.\nC_LIO_LIBiochar removed 97% of genes tested from environmental DNA of unfiltered effluent.\nC_LIO_LI85% of ARGs and MGEs of free-floating extracellular DNA were retained by biochar.\nC_LIO_LIBiochar is a WWTP by-product that can be re-used for public health sanitation.\nC_LI",

Although cortical maps are referred to as tonotopic, previous studies employed sounds that covary in spectral content and higher-level perceptual features such as pitch, making it unclear whether these maps are inherited from cochlear organization and are indeed tonotopic, or instead reflect transformations based on higher-level features. We used high-resolution fMRI to measure BOLD responses in 10 participants as they listened to pure tones that varied in frequency or complex tones that independently varied in either spectral content or fundamental frequency (pitch). We show that auditory cortical gradients are in fact a mixture of maps organized both by spectral content and pitch. Consistent with hierarchical organization, primary regions were tuned predominantly to spectral content, whereas higher-level pitch tuning was observed bilaterally in surrounding non-primary regions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDengue is a serious public health concern worldwide, with ~3 billion people at risk of contracting dengue virus (DENV) infections. Currently, no effective vaccine or drug is available for the prevention or treatment of dengue, which leaves only anti-mosquito strategies to combat this disease. The present study was initiated to determine the in-vitro and in vivo protective effects of a plant-derived phytopharmaceutical drug for the treatment of dengue.\n\nMethodology/Principal FindingsIn our previous report, we had identified methanolic extract of the aerial parts of Cissampelos pareira to exhibit in vitro and in vivo anti-dengue activity against all the four DENV serotypes. In the current study, we have identified another Indian medicinal plant, Cocculus hirsutus, which has a more potent anti-dengue activity than C. pareira. The activity has been evaluated through flow-cytometry-based virus inhibition assay. Interestingly, the stem of C. hirsutus was found to be more potent than the aerial part irrespective of the extraction solvent used viz., denatured spirit, hydro-alcohol (50:50) and water. Hence, the aqueous extract of stem of C. hirsutus (AQCH) was further advanced for investigations because of greater regulatory acceptance. The AQCH exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of release of DENV and its secretory antigen, NS1. Five chemical markers viz. Sinococuline, 20-Hydroxyecdysone, Makisterone-A, Magnoflorine and Coniferyl alcohol were identified as the major chemical ingredients of the AQCH extract. These chemicals were subsequently used for extract standardisation. Importantly, AQCH completely protected AG129 mice at 25 mg/kg/dose body weight when fed 4 times a day post-infection with a lethal dose of DENV-2 S221 strain. Because of its potential as an effective phytopharmaceutical drug against dengue, AQCH, has been formulated into tablets for further pre-clinical and clinical developments.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceWe provide evidence of the pan anti-dengue potential of C. hirsutus-based phytopharmaceutical drug as determined through in vitro and in vivo experiments. We have also characterized five chemical entities in the drug substance, which provides means for standardization of drug substance and drug product. Based on these findings, a program to develop a safe and effective C. hirsutus-derived phytopharmaceutical drug for the treatment of dengue has been initiated.\n\nAuthor summaryThere is an urgent need to develop a safe and effective drug against dengue, which is a rapidly expanding mosquito-borne viral disease. Half of the worlds population has been estimated to be at risk of contracting this disease and the situation remains grim due to lack of an approved drug. We aimed to develop an ethnopharmacological drug against dengue by exploring traditional Indian medicinal science, Ayurveda. This led us to identify a creeper, Cocculus hirsutus, as a more potent anti-dengue plant than Cissampelos pareira, reported in our earlier published study. The stem part of C. hirsutus was found to be more efficacious in inhibiting the propagation of dengue viruses (DENVs) in cell culture than its aerial part. Hence, we chose to advance aqueous extract of stem of C. hirsutus (AQCH) for further studies. Importantly, AQCH also protected immune-compromised mice from lethal DENV infection, which is suggestive of its potential clinical relevance. We have identified five chemical marker compounds in AQCH to gauge the quality and consistency of extract preparation and its formulation into stable tablets. Based on the findings of this study, we have undertaken the development of a safe and effective C. hirsutus-derived phytopharmaceutical drug for the treatment of dengue.",

    "abstract": "Investigation of outbreaks to identify the primary case is crucial for the interruption and prevention of transmission of infectious diseases. These individuals may have a higher risk of participating in near future transmission events when compared to the other patients in the outbreak, so directing more transmission prevention resources towards these individuals is a priority. Genetic characterization of intra-host viral populations, although highly efficient in the identification of transmission clusters, is not as efficient in routing transmissions during outbreaks, owing to complexity of viral evolution. Here, we present a new computational framework, PYCIVO: primary case inference in viral outbreaks. This framework expands upon our earlier work in development of QUENTIN, which builds a probabilistic disease transmission tree based on simulation of evolution of intra-host hepatitis C virus (HCV) variants between cases involved in direct transmission during an outbreak. PYCIVO improves upon QUENTIN by also implementing a custom heterogeneity index which empowers PYCIVO to make the important  No primary case prediction. One or more samples, possibly including the primary case, may have not been sampled, and this designation is meant to account for these scenarios. These approaches were validated using a set of 105 sequence samples from 11 distinct HCV transmission clusters identified during outbreak investigations, in which the primary case was epidemiologically verified. Both models can detect the correct primary case in 9 out of 11 transmission clusters (81.8%). However, while QUENTIN issues erroneous predictions on the remaining 2 transmission clusters, PYCIVO issues a null output for these clusters, giving it an effective prediction accuracy of 100%. To further evaluate accuracy of the inference, we created 10 modified transmission clusters in which the primary case had been removed. In this scenario, PYCIVO was able to correctly identify that there was no primary case in 8/10 (80%) of these modified clusters. This model was validated with HCV; however, this approach may be applicable to other microbial pathogens.\n\nA version of this software is publicly available at the following url: https://www.github.com/walkergussler/PYCIVO",

    "abstract": "Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a pathological disease caused by the foot- and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), which mainly affects cloven-hoofed animals. This study was conducted to a meta-analysis and experiment on the effect of bacteriophages used in the development of FMDV vaccines. A systematic search was conducted for the collection of the protection effect for the phage-based FMDV vaccine using sensitive search strategies. The extracted data were analyzed using Rev-Man 5.4 software. This experiment used the T7 phage to express the capsid protein VP1 of the OHM-02 strain, and the recombinant VP1 phage was termed OHM-T7. Antibodies and cytokines levels were assessed after immunizing BALB/C mice with OHM-T7. The results showed that a total of 115 articles were retrieved, and 4 of them met the inclusion criteria. There was no heterogeneity with I2 = 0%, 20% or 43%. We used a fixed-effect model for meta-analysis, and the results showed a protective effect on FMDV between the phage group and control group (P<0.01) and between FMDV group and control group (P<0.01). Furthermore, when the phage group was compared to the FMDV group, there was also no significant difference (P>0.05). After successfully obtained the ohm-t7 strain and immunized the mice, it could induce high levels of IFN-{gamma} levels in mice with little effect on IL-4 levels. OHM-T7 could be used to detect antibodies produced by mice immunized with different FMDV antigens and produce high levels of anti-FMD antibodies. In summary, these results showed the potential of phage-based FMDV vaccines in FMDV prevention.",
