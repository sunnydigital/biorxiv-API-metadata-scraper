    "abstract": "RNA research and applications were underpinned by in vitro transcription (IVT), while the RNA impurity resulted from the enzymatic reagents severely impede downstream applications. To improve the stability and purity of synthesized RNA we had characterized a novel single-subunit RNA polymerase (RNAP) encoded by a psychrophilic phage VSW-3 from plateau lake to produce RNA at low temperature. The VSW-3 RNAP is capable of carrying out in vitro RNA synthesis at low temperature (4-25{degrees}C) to reduce RNA degradation and alleviate the need of costly RNase inhibitor. Compared to routinely used T7 RNAP, VSW-3 RNAP provides comparable yield of transcripts, but is insensitive to class II transcription terminators and synthesizes RNA without redundant 3 -cis extension. More importantly, through dot-blot detection with the J2 monoclonal antibody, we found that the RNA products synthesized by VSW-3 RNAP contain much lower amount of or virtually no double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by-products, which are significant in most T7 RNAP products and may cause severe cellular immune response. Combining these advantages, the VSW-3 RNAP is an advantageous enzyme for IVT, especially to produce RNA for in vivo use.",

    "abstract": "COVID 19 has emerged as global pandemic with largest damage to the economy and human psyche. The genomic signature deciphered during the ongoing pandemic period is valuable to understand the virus evolutionary patterns and spread across the globe. Increased availability of genome information of circulating strain in our country will enable to generate selective details in virulent and non virulent markers to prophylaxis and therapeutic interventions. The first case of SARS CoV-2 was detected in Chambal region of Madhya Pradesh state in mid of March 2020 followed by multiple introduction events and expansion of COVID-19 cases within 3 months in this region. We analyzed around 5000 COVID -19 suspected samples referred to Defence Research and Development Establishment, Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh. A total of 136 cases were found positive over a span of three months period this includes virus introduction to region and further spread. Whole genome sequences employing Oxford nanopore technology were deciphered for 26 SARS-CoV-2 circulating in 10 different districts in Madhya Pradesh State of India. The region witnessed index cases with multiple travel history responsible for introduction of COVID-19 followed by remarkable expansion of virus. The genome wide substitutions including in important viral proteins were observed. The detailed phylogenetic analysis revealed the circulating SARS-CoV-2 clustered in multiple clades A2a, A4 and B. The cluster wise segregation was observed suggesting multiple introduction links and evolution of virus in the region. This is the first comprehensive details of whole genome sequence analysis from central India region, which will add genome wide knowledge towards diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.",

Previous work has demonstrated that the pH in the nasal passage experiences temporal fluctuations. Yet, the impact of such pH fluctuations on nasal microbiota is not fully understood. Here, we examine how temporal fluctuations in pH might affect the coexistence of nasal bacteria. We take advantage of the cultivability of nasal bacteria to experimentally assess their responses to pH. Based on experimentally observed responses, we formulate a mathematical model to numerically investigate the impact of temporal pH fluctuations on species coexistence. Through extensive numerical simulations, we find that the composition of nasal communities is robust against pH fluctuations. Our results suggest that nasal microbiota could be more robust than expected against environmental fluctuations.",

    "abstract": "Sparisoma viride is the most abundant parrotfish in the Caribbean and is considered as the most important excavator due to corallivore behaviour. Parrotfishes are a keystone group that favour the growth and resilience of coral reefs removing macroalgae and structuring the benthic communities. The microbial symbiotic communities are involved in multiple functions related to nutrition and immunity maintaining corals health. Because S. viride scrape coral tissues, the skeleton and the algae on coral, it could be important reservoirs or vectors of microorganism for the corals through the faeces dispersion, however, the role of parrotfishes as reservoirs are poorly studied. Establishing microbial communities present in parrotfish faeces will contribute to understand the ecological impact of parrotfishes in coral resilience. We investigated the composition of disseminated bacteria and the extent to which the cell integrity of dinoflagellate photosymbionts (Symbiodiniaceae) is maintained in the faeces and compare with sediments and water column controls. Then, we analysed diversity and structure of bacterial communities at family level and search similarities between faeces of the study and coral associated microbiome reported in the literature. Similar levels of structural integrity and photosynthetic health of Symbidiodinaceae cells were found in both faeces and reef sediments. Besides, the sediments microbiome echoes the parrotfish faecal microbiome by sharing high diversity and a similar bacterial community composition. Several bacterial families were present in parrotfish faeces and in coral microbiome reported in the literature highlighting the dispersal potential of parrotfishes replenishing coral reefs. Despite the sampling limitations, these findings uncover the potential role of the excavator parrotfish in enriching environmental reservoirs, especially reef sediments, with coral-associated bacteria and photosynthetic microalgae. Parrotfishes could reinforce the coral microbiome and facilitate coral symbiont acquisition, key features critical to maintaining the fitness of one of the most threatened ecosystems on Earth. This finding could be considered as a first step in uncovering a mechanism for reef-microbiome maintenance.",

Pathogenic variants in coatomer subunits or associated factors have been reported in multi-systemic disorders, i.e., coatopathies, that can affect the skeletal and central nervous systems. We have identified loss-of-function variants in COPB2, a component of the coatomer complex I (COPI), in individuals presenting with osteoporosis, fractures and developmental delay of variable severity. Because the role of COPB2 in bone has not been characterized, we studied the effect of COPB2 deficiency on skeletal development in mice and zebrafish. Copb2+/- mice showed low bone mass and decreased bone strength. In zebrafish, larvae carrying a copb2 heterozygous frameshift variant showed delayed mineralization. copb2-null embryos showed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi disorganization, and embryonic lethality. COPB2 siRNA-treated fibroblasts showed delayed collagen trafficking with retention of type I collagen in the ER and Golgi, and altered distribution of Golgi markers. Our data suggest that COPB2 haploinsufficiency leads to disruption of intracellular collagen trafficking and osteoporosis, which may improve with ascorbic acid supplementation. This work highlights the role of COPI complex as a critical regulator of bone mass and identifies a new form of coatopathy due to COPB2 deficiency.",

Thus, it seems safe to affirm that we will find similar results for the other Countries of South America, reducing speculation about the existence of rapid and silent mutations that, although there are as we have shown in this work, do not increase, until this moment, the genetic variability of the Virus, a fact that would hinder the work with molecular targets for vaccines and drugs in general.",

    "abstract": "Labyrinthula spp. are saprobic, marine protists that also act as opportunistic pathogens and are the causative agents of seagrass wasting disease (SWD). Despite the threat of local- and large-scale SWD outbreaks, there are currently gaps in our understanding of the drivers of SWD, particularly surrounding Labyrinthula virulence and ecology. Given these uncertainties, we investigated Labyrinthula from a novel genomic perspective by presenting the first draft genome and predicted proteome of a pathogenic isolate of Labyrinthula SR_Ha_C, generated from a hybrid assembly of Nanopore and Illumina sequences. Phylogenetic and cross-phyla comparisons revealed insights into the evolutionary history of Stramenopiles. Genome annotation showed evidence of glideosome-type machinery and an apicoplast protein typically found in protist pathogens and parasites. Proteins involved in Labyrinthulas actin-myosin mode of transport, as well as carbohydrate degradation were also prevalent. Further, CAZyme functional predictions revealed a repertoire of enzymes involved in breakdown of cell-wall and carbohydrate storage compounds common to seagrasses. The relatively low number of CAZymes annotated from the genome of Labyrinthula SR_Ha_C compared to other Labyrinthulea species may reflect the conservative annotation parameters, a specialised substrate affinity and the scarcity of characterised protist enzymes. Inherently, there is high probability for finding both unique and novel enzymes from Labyrinthula spp. This study provides resources for further exploration of Labyrinthula ecology and evolution, and will hopefully be the catalyst for new hypothesis-driven SWD research revealing more details of molecular interactions between Labyrinthula species and its host substrate.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBreeding has helped improve bread wheat yield significantly over the last century. Understanding the potential for future crop improvement depends on relating segregating genetic variation to agronomic traits.\n\nResultsWe bred NIAB Diverse MAGIC population, comprising over 500 recombinant inbred lines, descended from sixteen bread wheat varieties released between 1935-2004. We sequenced the founders exomes and promotors by capture. Despite being highly representative of North-West European wheat and capturing 73% of global polymorphism, we found 89% of genes contained no more than three haplotypes. We sequenced each line with 0.3x coverage whole-genome sequencing, and imputed 1.1M high-quality SNPs that were over 99% concordant with array genotypes. Imputation accuracy remained high at coverage as low as 0.076x, with or without the use of founder genomes as reference panels. We created a genotype-phenotype map for 47 traits over two years. We found 136 genome-wide significant associations, concentrated at 42 genetic loci with large and often pleiotropic effects. Outside of these loci most traits are polygenic, as revealed by multi-locus shrinkage modelling.\n\nConclusionsHistorically, wheat breeding has reshuffled a limited palette of haplotypes; continued improvement will require selection at dozens of loci of diminishing effect, as most of the major loci we mapped are known. Breeding to optimise one trait generates correlated trait changes, exemplified by the negative trade-off between yield and protein content, unless selection and recombination can break critical unfavourable trait-trait associations. Finally, low coverage whole genome sequencing of bread wheat populations is an economical and accurate genotyping strategy.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to the COVID-19 pandemic; a pandemic of a scale that has not been seen in the modern era. Despite over 29 million reported cases and over 900, 000 deaths worldwide as of September 2020, herd immunity and widespread vaccination efforts by many experts are expected to be insufficient in addressing this crisis for the foreseeable future. Thus, there is an urgent need for treatments that can lessen the effects of SARS-CoV-2 in patients who become seriously affected. Many viruses including HIV, the common cold, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use a unique mechanism known as -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) to successfully replicate and infect cells in the human host. SARS-CoV (the coronavirus responsible for SARS) and SARS-CoV-2 possess a unique RNA structure, a three-stemmed pseudoknot, that stimulates -1 PRF. Recent experiments identified that small molecules can be introduced as antiviral agents to bind with the pseudoknot and disrupt its stimulation of -1 PRF. If successfully developed, small molecule therapy that targets -1 PRF in SARS-CoV-2 is an excellent strategy to improve patients prognoses. Crucial to developing these successful therapies is modeling the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 -1 PRF pseudoknot. Following a structural alignment approach, we identify similarities in the -1 PRF pseudoknots of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the original SARS-CoV, as well as a third coronavirus: MERS-CoV, the coronavirus responsible for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). In addition, we provide a better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 -1 PRF pseudoknot by comprehensively investigating the structural landscape using a hierarchical folding approach. Since understanding the impact of mutations is vital to long-term success of treatments that are based on predicted RNA functional structures, we provide insight on SARS-CoV-2 -1 PRF pseudoknot sequence mutations and their effect on the resulting structure and its function.",

We showed previously that TBZ is also a potent vascular disrupting agent and inhibits angiogenesis at the tissue level by dissociating vascular endothelial cells in newly formed blood vessels. Here, we uncover TBZs molecular target and mechanism of action. Using human cell culture, molecular modeling, and humanized yeast, we find that TBZ selectively targets only 1 of 9 human {beta}-tubulin isotypes (TUBB8) to specifically disrupt endothelial cell microtubules. By leveraging epidemiological pesticide resistance data and mining chemical features of commercially used benzimidazoles, we discover that a broader class of benzimidazole compounds, in extensive use for 50 years, also potently disrupt immature blood vessels and inhibit angiogenesis. Thus, besides identifying the molecular mechanism of benzimidazole-mediated vascular disruption, this study presents evidence relevant to the widespread use of these compounds while offering potential new clinical applications.",

We have compiled public resources into three models and a portal to support comprehensive systems analysis of C. difficile. First, by leveraging 151 transcriptomes from 11 studies we generated a regulatory model (EGRIN) that organizes 90% of C. difficile genes into 297 high quality conditional co-regulation modules. EGRIN predictions, validated with independent datasets, recapitulated and extended regulons of key transcription factors, implicating new genes for sporulation, carbohydrate transport and metabolism. Second, by advancing a metabolic model, we discovered that 15 amino acids, diverse carbohydrates, and 10 metabolic genes are essential for C. difficile growth within an intestinal environment. Finally, by integrating EGRIN with the metabolic model, we developed a PRIME model that revealed unprecedented insights into combinatorial control of essential processes for in vivo colonization of C. difficile and its interactions with commensals. We have developed an interactive web portal (http://networks.systemsbiology.net/cdiff-portal/) to disseminate all data, algorithms, and models to support collaborative systems analyses of C. difficile.",

    "abstract": "Neonatal seizures pose a clinical challenge for their early detection, acute management, and mitigation of long-term comorbidities. A major cause of neonatal seizures is hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy that results in seizures that are frequently refractory to the first-line anti-seizure medication phenobarbital (PB). One proposed mechanism for PB-inefficacy during neonatal seizures is the reduced expression and function of the neuron-specific K+/Cl- cotransporter 2 (KCC2), the main neuronal Cl- extruder that maintains chloride homeostasis and influences the efficacy of GABAergic inhibition. To determine if PB-refractoriness after ischemic neonatal seizures is dependent upon KCC2 hypofunction and can be rescued by KCC2 functional enhancement, we investigated the recently developed KCC2 functional enhancer CLP290 in a CD-1 mouse model of refractory ischemic neonatal seizures quantified with vEEG. We report that acute CLP290 intervention can rescue PB-resistance, KCC2 expression, and the development of epileptogenesis after ischemic neonatal seizures. KCC2 phosphorylation sites have a strong influence over KCC2 activity and seizure susceptibility in adult experimental epilepsy models. Therefore, we investigated seizure susceptibility in two different knock-in mice in which either phosphorylation of S940 or T906/T1007 was prevented. We report that KCC2 phosphorylation regulates both neonatal seizure susceptibility and CLP290-mediated KCC2 functional enhancement. Our results validate KCC2 as a clinically relevant target for refractory neonatal seizures and provide insights for future KCC2 drug development.",

    "abstract": "Adult Neural progenitor cells (aNPCs) ensure lifelong neurogenesis in the mammalian hippocampus. Proper regulation of aNPC fate entails important implications for brain plasticity and healthy aging. Piwi proteins and the small noncoding RNAs interacting with them (piRNAs) are best known in gonads as repressors of transposons. Here, we show that Piwil2 (Mili) and piRNAs are abundant in aNPCs of the postnatal mouse hippocampus and demonstrate that this pathway is essential for proper neurogenesis. Particularly, depleting the piRNA pathway in aNPCs impaired neurogenesis, increased senescence and accordingly the generation of reactive glia. Moreover, this manipulation primarily elevated 5S ribosomal RNA, SINEB1 and mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and regulators of translation, resulting in higher polysome density and protein synthesis upon differentiation. Our results provide evidence of an essential role for the piRNA pathway in maintaining homeostasis to sustain neural stem cell fate, underpinning its possible involvement in brain plasticity and successful aging.",

    "abstract": "TDP-43 nuclear depletion and concurrent cytoplasmic accumulation in vulnerable neurons is a hallmark feature of progressive neurodegenerative proteinopathies such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Cellular stress signalling and stress granule dynamics are now recognized to play a role in ALS/FTD pathogenesis. Defective stress granule assembly is associated with increased cellular vulnerability and death. G3BP1 (Ras-GAP SH3-domain-binding protein 1) is a critical stress granule assembly factor. Here, we define that TDP-43 stabilizes G3BP1 transcripts via direct binding of a highly conserved cis regulatory element within the 3UTR. Moreover, we show in vitro and in vivo that nuclear TDP-43 depletion is sufficient to reduce G3BP1 protein levels. Finally, we establish that G3BP1 transcripts are reduced in ALS/FTD patient neurons bearing TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions/nuclear depletion. Thus, our data suggest that, in ALS/FTD, there is a compromised stress granule response in disease-affected neurons due to impaired G3BP1 mRNA stability caused by TDP-43 nuclear depletion. These data implicate TDP-43 and G3BP1 loss of function as contributors to disease.",

Cellular profiling revealed two distinct neutrophil subsets expressing either the lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) or the Interleukin-3 receptor alpha (CD123), both significantly overrepresented in ICU patients compared to non-ICU patients. The proportion of LOX-1-expressing immature neutrophils positively correlated with clinical severity, with the cytokine storm (IL-1{beta}, IL-6, IL-8, TNF), and with intravascular coagulation. Importantly, high proportions of LOX-1+-immature neutrophils are associated with high risks of severe thrombosis.\n\nConclusionsTogether these data suggest that point of care enumeration of LOX-1-immature neutrophils might help distinguish patients at risk of thrombosis complication and most likely to benefit from intensified anticoagulant therapy.",

We analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cells for clonal expansion in 11 children who initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) between 1.8-17.4 months of age and with viremia suppressed for 6-9 years. We obtained 8,662 HIV-1 integration sites from pre-ART and 1,861 sites on ART. Expanded clones of infected cells were detected pre-ART in 10/11 children. In 8 children, infected cell clones detected pre-ART persisted for 6-9 years on ART. A comparison of integration sites in the samples obtained on ART with healthy donor PBMC infected ex-vivo showed selection for cells with proviruses integrated in BACH2 and STAT5B. Our analyses indicate that, despite marked differences in T cell composition and dynamics between children and adults, HIV-infected cell clones are established early in children, persist for up to 9 years on ART, and can be driven by proviral integration in proto-oncogenes.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic nucleic acid methyltransferase (MTase) proteins are essential mediators of epigenetic and epitranscriptomic regulation. DNMT2 belongs to a large, conserved family of DNA MTases found in many organisms, including holometabolous insects like fruit flies and mosquitoes, where it is the lone MTase. Interestingly, despite its nomenclature, DNMT2 is not a DNA MTase, but instead targets and methylates RNA species. A growing body of literature suggest DNMT2 mediates the host immune response against a wide range of pathogens, including RNA viruses. Evidence of adaptive evolution, in the form of positive selection, can often be found in genes that are engaged in conflict with pathogens like viruses. Here we identify and describe evidence of positive selection that has occurred at different times over the course of DNMT2 evolution within dipteran insects. We identify specific codons within each ortholog that are under positive selection, and find they are restricted to four distinct domains of the protein and likely influence substrate binding, target recognition, and adaptation of unique intermolecular interactions. Additionally, we describe the role of the Drosophila-specific host protein IPOD, in regulating the expression and/or function of fruit fly DNMT2. Finally, heterologous expression of these orthologs suggest that DNMT2s role as an antiviral is host dependent, indicating a requirement for additional host-specific factors. Collectively, our findings highlight the adaptive evolution of DNMT2 in Dipteran insects, underscoring its role as an important, albeit non-canonical, regulator of host-pathogen interactions in mosquitoes and fruit flies.",

Culturing them in standard 7H9 medium to the early logarithmic phase and transferring them into 7H9 medium at pH 6.6 and pH 5.0 and maintenance solution at pH 6.6 and pH 4.5. Likewise, macrophages Raw264.7 were infected with multiple infections at 10. The results showed that while they grew in 7H9 medium at pH 5.0 or pH 6.6 and maintenance buffer at pH 4.5, the lived number of over-expressing strain PmvRv3671 is more than wild-type strain M.bovis, {Delta}MarpComp and{Delta} Marp on the 14th day.

    "abstract": "The effects of senescence and aging on geriatric diseases has been well explored but how these influence infections in the elderly have been scarcely addressed. Here, we show that several innate immune responses are elevated in senescent cells and old mice, allowing them to promptly respond to bacterial infections. We have identified higher levels of iNOS as a crucial host response and show that p38 MAPK in senescent cells acts as a negative regulator of iNOS transcription. In old mice, however the ability to impede bacterial proliferation does not correlate with increased survival as elevated immune responses persist unabated eventually affecting the host. The use of anti-inflammatory drugs that could consequently be recommended also decreases iNOS disarming the host of a critical innate immune response. Overall, our study highlights that infection associated mortality in the elderly is not merely an outcome of pathogen load but is also influenced by the hosts ability to resolve inflammation induced damage.\n\nSummary statementUsing cellular models and old mice we demonstrate the effect of aging on host response to bacterial infections. Aged systems mount a more effective anti-bacterial innate immune response but its persistence results in mortality of the host.",

    "abstract": "Deformed wing virus (DWV) has been best characterized among honey bee viruses; however, very little is known about the mechanisms of viral infection and replication due to the lack of honey bee cell lines. To resolve this problem, we established in vitro system to reconstitute DWV binding and entry to the host cell followed by translation of the genome RNA and the polyprotein processing with honey bee pupal cells. Using this system, P-domain of VP1 was found to be essential for DWV infection/replication but not binding/entry to the cell. DWV efficiently infects/replicates in cells derived from early but not late pupa, suggesting that the undifferentiated cells are targeted for the viral infection/replication. Furthermore, we found that inhibitors for mammalian picornavirus 3C-Protease, Rupintrivir and Quercetin suppress DWV infection/replication, indicating that this in vitro system is also useful for screening a compound to modify the viral infection/replication. Our in vitro system should help to understand the mechanisms of DWV infection and replication at the early stage.\n\nImportanceRecent decline of managed honey bee colonies has been driven by the pathogens and parasites. However, studying the mechanisms of pathogen infection and replication in honey bee at molecular and cellular levels has been challenging. DWV is the most prevalent virus in honey bee across the globe and we established in vitro system to reconstitute the viral infection and replication with the primary pupal cells. Using RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and the negative strand of DWV genome RNA as markers, we show that the pupal cells can support DWV infection and at least replication at the early stage. The results shown in this report indicate that our in vitro system helps to uncover the mechanisms of DWV infection and replication. Furthermore, it is also feasible to conduct a large scale screening for compounds to inhibit or stimulate DWV infection/replication.",

    "abstract": "Diatoms are one of the most successful phytoplankton groups in our oceans, being responsible for over 20% of the Earths photosynthetic productivity. Their chimeric genomes have genes derived from red algae, green algae, bacteria and heterotrophs, resulting in multiple isoenzymes targeted to different cellular compartments with the potential for differential regulation under nutrient limitation. The resulting interactions between metabolic pathways are not yet fully understood.\n\nWe previously showed how acclimation to Cu limitation enhanced susceptibility to overreduction of the photosynthetic electron transport chain and its reorganization to favor photoprotection over light-harvesting in the oceanic diatom Thalassiosira oceanica (Hippmann et al., 2017). In order to gain a better understanding of the overall metabolic changes that help alleviate the stress of Cu limitation, we have further analyzed the comprehensive proteomic datasets generated in that study to identify differentially expressed proteins involved in carbon, nitrogen and oxidative stress-related metabolic pathways.\n\nMetabolic pathway analysis showed integrated responses to Cu limitation. The up-regulation of ferredoxin (Fdx) was correlated with up-regulation of plastidial Fdx-dependent isoenzymes involved in nitrogen assimilation as well as enzymes involved in glutathione synthesis, thus integrating nitrogen uptake and metabolism with photosynthesis and oxidative stress resistance. The differential expression of glycolytic isoenzymes located in the chloroplast and mitochondria may enable them to channel both excess electrons and/or ATP between these compartments. Additional evidence for chloroplast-mitochondrial cross-talk is the increased expression of chloroplast and mitochondrial proteins involved in the proposed malate shunt under Cu limitation.\n\nOne sentence summaryDiatoms adapt to Cu limitation by regulating their large repertoire of isoenzymes to channel electrons away from the chloroplast, enhance nitrogen uptake, and integrate the oxidative stress response. 123",

An individual-based model of the plasmidome is presented and used to investigate how intra- and intercellular competition between diverse plasmid types affects the evolution of plasmid communities. It indicates the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic drivers of plasmid persistence both under neutral conditions and when the environment selects for specific plasmid-encoded traits such as antibiotic resistance for a certain period of time.

    "abstract": "A hallmark of the desert locusts ancient and deserved reputation as a devastating agricultural pest is that of the long-distance, multi-generational migration of locust swarms to new habitats. The bacterial symbionts that reside within the locust gut comprise a key aspect of its biology, augmenting its immunity and having also been reported to be involved in the swarming phenomenon through the emission of attractant volatiles. However, it is still unclear whether and how these beneficial symbionts are transmitted vertically from parent to offspring. Using comparative 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and direct experiments with engineered bacteria, we provide here evidence of the vertical transmission of locust gut bacteria. The females perform this activity by way of inoculation of the egg-pods foam plug, through which the larvae pass upon hatching. Furthermore, analysis of the biochemical structure of the foam revealed chitin to be its major component, along with immunity-related proteins such as lysozyme, which could be responsible for the inhibition of some bacteria in the foam while allowing other, more beneficial, strains to proliferate. Our findings reveal a potential vector for the transgenerational transmission of symbionts in locusts, which contributes to the locust swarms ability to invade and survive in new territories.",

To alleviate LI, previous studies mainly focused on strengthening intestinal {beta}-galactosidase activity but neglected the inconspicuous colon pH drop caused by gut microbes fermentation on non-hydrolysed lactose. The colon pH drop will reduce intestinal {beta}-galactosidase activity and influence the intestinal homeostasis.\n\nResultsHere, we synthesized a tri-stable-switch circuit equipped with high {beta}-galactosidase activity and pH rescue ability.

We confirmed the circuit functionality was efficient using 12-hrs in vitro culture at a range of pH levels, as well as 6-hrs in vivo simulations in mice colon. Moreover, another 21-days mice trial indicated that this circuit can recover lactose-effected gut microbiota of mice to the status (enterotypes) similar to that of mice without lactose intake.\n\nConclusionsTaken together, the tri-stable-switch circuit can serve as a promising prototype for LI symptoms relief, especially by flexibly adapting to environmental variation, stabilizing colon pH and restoring gut microbiota.",

Using microarray gene expression data and using different computational techniques this study investigated the role of RHBDD2 in sepsis and septic shock. Finds functional annotation of RHBDD2 using co-expression analysis and identified the deregulation of RHBDD2 in sepsis using differential expression analysis. Results show that RHBDD2 is overexpressed in sepsis and septic shock. The GO enrichment analysis, KEGG pathways, and biological functions of the RHBDD2 co-expressed genes module show that it is involved in most of the sepsis-related biological functions and also plays a role in most of the infection-related pathways which lead to sepsis and septic shock. RHBDD2 is regulated by STAT5A and SPI1 transcription factors in sepsis and septic shock. The identification of the RHBDD2 as a biomarker may facilitate in septic shock diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.",

Owing to the fact that different sections of the biomedical data is produced by different organizations/institutions using various types of technologies, the data are scattered across individual computational resources, without any explicit relations/connections to each other, which greatly hinders the comprehensive multi-omics-based analysis of data. We aimed to address this issue by constructing a new biological and biomedical data resource, CROssBAR, a comprehensive system that integrates large-scale biomedical data from various resources and store them in a new NoSQL database, enrich these data with deep-learning-based prediction of relations between numerous biomedical entities, rigorously analyse the enriched data to obtain biologically meaningful modules and display them to users via easy-to-interpret, interactive and heterogenous knowledge graph (KG) representations within an open access, user-friendly and online web-service at https://crossbar.kansil.org. As a use-case study, we constructed CROssBAR COVID-19 KGs (available at: https://crossbar.kansil.org/covid_main.php) that incorporate relevant virus and host genes/proteins, interactions, pathways, phenotypes and other diseases, as well as known and completely new predicted drugs/compounds.

    "abstract": "Distinct regions of the cerebellum connect to separate regions of the cerebral cortex forming a complex topography. While key properties of cerebellar organization have been revealed in group-averaged data, in-depth study of individuals provides an opportunity to discover functional-anatomical features that emerge at a higher spatial resolution. Here functional connectivity MRI was used to examine the cerebellum of two intensively-sampled individuals (each scanned across 31 MRI sessions). Connectivity to somatomotor cortex showed the expected crossed laterality and inversion of the body maps between the anterior and posterior lobes. A surprising discovery was connectivity to the primary visual cortex along the vermis with evidence for representation of the central field. Within the hemispheres, each individual displayed a hierarchical progression from the inverted anterior lobe somatomotor map through to higher-order association zones. The hierarchy ended near Crus I/II and then progressed in reverse order through to the upright somatomotor map in the posterior lobe. Evidence for a third set of networks was found in the most posterior extent of the cerebellum. Detailed analysis of the higher-order association networks around the Crus I/II apex revealed robust representations of two distinct networks linked to the default network, multiple networks linked to cognitive control, as well as a separate representation of a language network. While idiosyncratic spatial details emerged between subjects, each of these networks could be detected in both individuals, and small seed regions placed within the cerebellum recapitulated the full extent of the spatially-specific cerebral networks. The observation of multiple networks in juxtaposed regions at the Crus I/II apex confirms the importance of this zone to higher-order cognitive function and reveals new organizational details.",

This gap is particularly acute for psychosis-spectrum disorders (PSD). Here, in a sample of 436 cross-diagnostic PSD patients, we derived and replicated a dimensionality-reduced symptom space across hallmark psychopathology symptoms and cognitive deficits. In turn, these symptom axes mapped onto distinct, reproducible brain maps. Critically, we found that multivariate brain-behavior mapping techniques (e.g. canonical correlation analysis) do not produce stable results. Instead, we show that a univariate brain-behavioral space (BBS) can resolve stable individualized prediction. Finally, we show a proof-of-principle framework for relating personalized BBS metrics with molecular targets via serotonin and glutamate receptor manipulations and gene expression maps. Collectively, these results highlight a stable and data-driven BBS mapping across PSD, which offers an actionable path that can be iteratively optimized for personalized clinical biomarker endpoints.",

    "abstract": "Central pattern generators (CPGs) are neurons or neural circuits that produce periodic output without requiring patterned input. More complex behaviors can be assembled from simpler subroutines, and nested CPGs have been proposed to coordinate their repetitive elements, organizing control over different time-scales. Here, we use behavioral experiments to establish that Drosophila grooming may be controlled by nested CPGs. On a short time-scale (5-7 Hz), flies execute periodic leg sweeps and rubs. More surprisingly, transitions between bouts of head cleaning and leg rubbing are also periodic on a longer time-scale (0.3 - 0.6 Hz). We examine grooming at a range of temperatures to show that the frequencies of both oscillations increase - a hallmark of CPG control - and also that the two time-scales increase at the same rate, indicating that the nested CPGs may be linked. This relationship also holds when sensory drive is held constant using optogenetic activation, but the rhythms can decouple in spontaneously grooming flies, showing that alternative control modes are possible. Loss of sensory feedback does not disrupt periodicity but slows the longer time-scale alternation. Nested CPGs simplify generation of complex but repetitive behaviors, and identifying them in Drosophila grooming presents an opportunity to map the neural circuits that constitute them.",

    "abstract": "Evaluating the structure-function relationship of viral envelope (Env) evolution and the development of broadly cross-neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) in natural infection can inform rational immunogen design. In the present study, we examined the magnitude and specificity of autologous neutralizing antibodies induced in rabbits by a novel HIV-1 clade C Env protein (1PGE-THIVC) vis-a-vis those developed in an elite neutralizer from whom the env sequence was obtained that was used to prepare the soluble Env protein. The thermostable 1PGE-THIVC Env displayed a native like pre-fusion closed conformation in solution as determined by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and negative stain electron microscopy (EM). This closed spike conformation of 1PGE-THIVC Env trimers was correlated with weak or undetectable binding of non-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) compared to neutralizing mAbs. Furthermore, 1PGE-THIVC SOSIP induced potent neutralizing antibodies in rabbits to autologous virus variants. The autologous neutralizing antibody specificity induced in rabbits by 1PGE-THIVC was mapped to the C3/V4 region (T362/P401) of viral Env. This observation agreed with electron microscopy polyclonal epitope mapping (EMPEM) of the Env trimer complexed with IgG Fab prepared from the immunized rabbit sera. While the specificity of antibodies elicited in rabbits associated with neutralizing autologous viruses were distinct to those developed in the elite neutralizer, EMPEM analysis demonstrated significant changes to Env conformations when incubated with polyclonal antibody sera from the elite neutralizer, suggesting these antibodies lead to the destabilization of Env trimers. Our study not only shows distinct mechanisms associated with potent neutralization of sequence matched and unmatched autologous viruses by antibodies induced in rabbits and in the elite neutralizer, but also highlights how neutralizing antibodies developed during the course of natural infection can impact viral Env conformations.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe interplay between circulating virus variants and broadly cross neutralizing polyclonal antibodies developed in a subset of elite neutralizers is widely believed to provide strategies for rational immunogen design. In the present study, we studied the structural, antigenic and immunogenic properties of a thermostable soluble trimeric protein with near native pre-fusion conformation prepared using the primary sequence of an HIV-1 clade C env isolated from the broadly cross neutralizing plasma of an elite neutralizer. This novel SOSIP Env trimer demonstrated comparable antigenic, structural and immunogenic properties that favoured several ongoing subunit vaccine design efforts. The novel clade C SOSIP induced polyclonal neutralizing antibody response developed in rabbits not only differed in its epitope specificity compared to that elicited in natural infection in presence of pool of viral quasispecies but also showed how they differ in their ability to influence Env structure and conformation. A better understanding of how vaccine-induced polyclonal neutralizing antibody responses compares to responses that developed in natural infection will improve our knowledge in designing better vaccine design strategies.",

    "abstract": "A wide variety of organisms possess endogenous circadian rhythms (~24 h period), which coordinate many physiological functions with the day-night cycle. These rhythms are mediated by a molecular mechanism based on transcription-translation feedback. A number of mathematical models have been developed to study features of the circadian clock in a variety of organisms. In this paper, we use bifurcation theory to explore properties of mathematical models based on Kim & Forgers interpretation of the circadian clock in mammals. Their models are based on a simple negative feedback (SNF) loop between a regulatory protein (PER) and its transcriptional activator (BMAL). In their model, PER binds to BMAL to form a stoichiometric complex (PER:BMAL) that is inactive as a transcription factor. However, for oscillations to occur in the SNF model, the dissociation constant of the PER:BMAL complex, Kd, must be smaller than 10-3 nM, orders of magnitude below the limit set by the biophysics of protein binding. We have relaxed this constraint by introducing two modifications to Kim & Forgers SNF model: (1) replacing the first-order rate law for degradation of PER in the nucleus by a Michaelis-Menten rate law, and (2) introducing a multistep reaction chain for posttranslational modifications of PER. These modifications significantly increase the robustness of oscillations, and increase the maximum allowable Kd to more reasonable values, 1--100 nM. In a third modification, we considered alternative rate laws for gene transcription to resolve an unrealistically large rate of PER transcription at very low levels of BMAL transcription factor. Additionally, we studied Kim & Forgers extensions of the SNF model to include a second negative feedback loop (involving REV-ERB) and a supplementary positive feedback loop (involving ROR). We found that the supplementary positive feedback loop--but not the supplementary negative feedback loop-- provides additional robustness to the clock model.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe circadian rhythm aligns bodily functions to the day/night cycle and is important for our health. The rhythm originates from an intracellular, molecular clock mechanism that mediates rhythmic gene expression. It is long understood that transcriptional negative feedback with sufficient time delay is key to generating circadian oscillations. However, some of the most widely cited mathematical models for the circadian clock suffer from problems of parameter \"fragilities\". That is, sustained oscillations are possible only for physically unrealistic parameter values. A recent model by Kim and Forger nicely incorporates the inhibitory binding of PER, a key clock protein, to its transcription activator BMAL, but oscillations in their model require a binding affinity between PER and BMAL that is orders of magnitude lower than the physical limit of protein-protein binding. To rectify this problem, we make several physiologically credible modifications to the Kim-Forger model, which allow oscillations to occur with realistic binding affinity. The modified model is further extended to explore the potential roles of supplementary feedback loops in the mammalian clock mechanism. Ultimately, accurate models of the circadian clock will provide predictive tools for chronotherapy and chrono-pharmacology studies.",

    "abstract": "Difficulty in cessation of drinking, smoking, or gambling has been widely recognized. Conventional theories proposed relative dominance of habitual over goal-directed control, but human studies have not convincingly supported them. Referring to the recently suggested \"successor representation\" of states that enables partially goal-directed control, we propose a dopamine-related mechanism potentially underlying the difficulty in resisting habitual reward-seeking, common to substance and non-substance reward. Consider that a person has long been taking a series of actions leading to a certain reward without resisting temptation. Given the suggestions of the successor representation and the dimension reduction in the brain, we assumed that the person has acquired a dimension-reduced successor representation of states based on the goal state under the established non-resistant policy. Then, we show that if the person changes the policy to resist temptation, a large positive reward prediction error (RPE) becomes generated upon eventually reaching the goal, and it sustains given that the acquired state representation is so rigid that it does not change. Inspired by the anatomically suggested spiral striatum-midbrain circuit and the theoretically proposed spiraling accumulation of RPE bias in addiction, we further simulated the influence of RPEs generated in the goal-based representation system on another system representing individual actions. We then found that such an influence could potentially enhance the propensity of non-resistant choice. These results suggest that the inaccurate value estimation in the reduced successor representation system and its influence through the spiral striatum-midbrain circuit might contribute to the difficulty in cessation of habitual reward-seeking.",

    "abstract": "The European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) exhibits female-biased sexual size dimorphism (SDD) early in development. New tagging techniques provide the opportunity to monitor individual sex-related growth during the post-larval and juvenile stages.\n\nWe produced an experimental population through artificial fertilization and followed a rearing-temperature protocol ([~]16 {degrees}C from hatching to 112 days post-hatching, dph; [~]20 {degrees}C from 117 to 358 dph) targeting a roughly balanced sex ratio. The fish were tagged with microchips between 61 and 96 dph in five tagging trials of 50 fish each; individual standard length (SL) was recorded through repeated biometric measurements performed between 83 to 110 dph via image analyses. Body weight (BW) was modelled using the traits measured on the digital pictures (i.e. SL, area, height, perimeter and volume). At 117 dph, the fish were tagged with microtags and regularly measured for SL and BW until 335 dph. The experiment ended at 358 dph with the sexing of the fish.\n\nThe sex-ratio at the end of the experiment was significantly in favor of the females (65.9% vs. 34.1%). The females were significantly longer and heavier than the males from 103 dph ([~]30 mm SL, [~]0.44 g BW) to 165 dph. A significant difference in the daily growth coefficient (DGC) was observed only between 96 and 103 dph, suggesting a physiological or biological change occurring during this period.\n\nThe female-biased SSD pattern in European sea bass is thus strongly influenced by very early growth differences between sexes, in any case long before gonadal sex differentiation has been started. This leads to the hypothesis that early growth may be a cause rather than a consequence of sex determination in sea bass.",

    "abstract": "Pantoea agglomerans is a Gram-negative aerobic bacillus causing a wide range of opportunistic infections in humans including septicemia, pneumonia, septic arthritis, wound infections and meningitis. To date, the determinants of virulence, antibiotic resistance, metabolic features conferring survival and host-associated pathogenic potential of this bacterium remain largely underexplored. In this study, we sequenced and assembled the whole-genome of P. agglomerans KM1 isolated from kimchi in South Korea. The genome contained one circular chromosome of 4,039,945 bp, 3 mega plasmids, and 2 prophages. The phage-derived genes encoded integrase, lysozyme and terminase. Six CRISPR loci were identified within the bacterial chromosome. Further in-depth analysis showed that the genome contained 13 antibiotic resistance genes conferring resistance to clinically important antibiotics such as penicillin G, bacitracin, rifampicin, vancomycin, and fosfomycin. Genes involved in adaptations to environmental stress were also identified which included factors providing resistance to osmotic lysis, oxidative stress, as well as heat and cold shock. The genomic analysis of virulence factors led to identification of a type VI secretion system, hemolysin, filamentous hemagglutinin, and genes involved in iron uptake and sequestration. Finally, the data provided here show that, the KM1 isolate exerted strong immunostimulatory properties on RAW 264.7 macrophages in vitro. Stimulated cells produced Nitric Oxide (NO) and pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-, IL-6 and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The upstream signaling for production of TNF-, IL-6, IL-10, and NO depended on TLR4 and TLR1/2. While production of TNF-, IL-6 and NO involved solely activation of the NF-{kappa}B, IL-10 secretion was largely dependent on NF-{kappa}B and to a lesser extent on MAPK Kinases. Taken together, the analysis of the whole-genome and immunostimulatory properties provided in-depth characterization of the P. agglomerans KM1 isolate shedding a new light on determinants of virulence that drive its interactions with the environment, other microorganisms and eukaryotic hosts.",
