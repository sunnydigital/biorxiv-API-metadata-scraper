    "abstract": "Neuronal inputs to microcircuits are often present as multiple copies of apparently equivalent neurons. Thus far, however, little is known regarding the relative influence on microcircuit output of activating all or only some copies of such an input. We are examining this issue in the crab (Cancer borealis) stomatogastric ganglion, where the gastric mill (chewing) microcircuit is activated by MCN1, a paired modulatory projection neuron. Both MCN1s contain the same cotransmitters, influence the same gastric mill circuit neurons, can drive the biphasic gastric mill rhythm, and are co-activated by all identified MCN1-activating pathways. Here, we determine whether the gastric mill circuit response is equivalent when stimulating one or both MCN1s under conditions where the pair are matched to collectively fire at the same overall rate and pattern as single MCN1 stimulation. The dual MCN1 stimulations elicited more consistently coordinated rhythms, and these rhythms exhibited longer phases and cycle periods. These different outcomes from single and dual MCN1 stimulation may have resulted from the relatively modest, and equivalent, firing rate of the gastric mill neuron LG during each matched set of stimulations. The LG neuron-mediated, ionotropic inhibition of the MCN1 axon terminals is the trigger for the transition from the retraction to protraction phase. This LG neuron influence on MCN1 was more effective during the dual stimulations, where each MCN1 firing rate was half that occurring during the matched single stimulations. Thus, equivalent individual- and co-activation of a class of modulatory projection neurons will not necessarily drive equivalent microcircuit output.\n\nSummary StatementCo-stimulating both copies of an identified modulatory projection neuron at the same collective firing rate used for single copy stimulation results in distinct microcircuit output.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies suggested that eye movements are linked to temporal predictability. These studies manipulated predictability by setting the cue-target interval (foreperiod) to be fixed or random throughout block. Findings showed that pre-target oculomotor behavior was reduced in the fixed relative to the random condition. This effect was interpreted as reflecting the formation of temporal expectation. However, it is unknown whether the effect is driven by target-specific temporal orienting, or rather a result of a more context-dependent state of certainty that participants may experience during blocks with a high predictability rate.\n\nIn thus study we dissociated certainty and orienting in a tilt-discrimination task. In each trial, a temporal cue (fixation color change) was followed by a tilted grating-patch. The foreperiod distribution was varied between blocks to be either fully fixed (same foreperiod in 100% of trials), mostly fixed (80% of trials with one foreperiod and 20% with another) or random (five foreperiods in equal probabilities). The two hypotheses led to different prediction models which were tested against the experimental data.\n\nResults were consistent with the orienting hypothesis and inconsistent with the certainty hypothesis, supporting the link between oculomotor inhibition and temporal orienting and its validity as a temporal expectations marker.",

    "abstract": "Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) gene represents an intracellular hub of developmental processes and has been related to cognitive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders. Mice with whole-brain DISC1 knock-down show memory and executive deficits as result of impaired prefrontal-hippocampal communication throughout development, especially when combined with early environmental stressors, such as maternal immune activation (MIA). While synaptic dysfunction of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in neonatal prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been recently identified as one source of abnormal long-range coupling in these mice, it is still unclear whether the hippocampus (HP) is also compromised during development. Here we aim to fill this knowledge gap by combining in vivo electrophysiology and optogenetics with morphological and behavioral assessment of immune-challenged mice with DISC1 knock-down either in the whole brain (GE) or restricted to pyramidal neurons in CA1 area of intermediate/ventral HP (i/vHP) (GHPE). Both groups of mice show abnormal network activity, sharp-waves (SPWs) and neuronal firing in CA1 area. Moreover, optogenetic stimulation of CA1 pyramidal neurons fails to activate the local circuits in the neonatal PFC. These deficits that persist until pre-juvenile development are due to dendrite sparsification and loss of spines of CA1 pyramidal neurons. As a long-term consequence, DISC1 knock-down in immune-challenged mice leads to poorer recognition memory at pre-juvenile age. Thus, besides PFC, hippocampal CA1 area has a critical role for the developmental miswiring and long-lasting cognitive impairment related to mental illness.\n\nSignificance StatementDevelopmental miswiring within prefrontal-hippocampal networks has been proposed to account for cognitive impairment in mental disorders. Indeed, during development, long before the emergence of cognitive deficits, the functional coupling within these networks is reduced in mouse models of disease. However, the cellular mechanisms of dysfunction are largely unknown. Here we combine in vivo electrophysiology and optogenetics with behavioral assessment in immune-challenged mice with hippocampus-confined DISC1 knock-down and show that pyramidal neurons in CA1 area are critical for the developmental dysfunction of prefrontal-hippocampal communication and cognitive impairment.",

Here, we introduce a versatile platform for label-free, comprehensive and detailed electrophysiological live-cell imaging of various neurogenic cells and tissues over extended times.

We set out to demonstrate the capabilities of this platform with recordings from primary and iPSC-derived neuronal cultures and tissue preparations over several weeks, providing detailed morpho-electrical phenotypic parameters at subcellular, cellular and network level.

    "abstract": "Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is characterized by recurrent seizures driven by synchronous neuronal activity. The dentate gyrus (DG) region of the hippocampal formation is highly reorganized in chronic TLE; in particular, pathological remodeling of the \"dentate gate\" is thought to open up pathological conduction pathways for synchronous discharges and seizures in the mesial temporal lobe. However, this pathophysiological framework lacks a mechanistic explanation of how macroscale synchronous dynamics emerge from alterations of the DG at the microcircuit level. In particular, the relative contribution of developmentally defined subpopulations of adult-born (abGCs) and mature (mGCs) granule cells to epileptiform network events remains unknown. To address this question, we optically recorded activity dynamics of identified populations of abGCs and mGCs during interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in mice with chronic TLE. We find that disjoint subsets of IEDs differentially recruit abGC and mGC populations. We used these observations to develop a neural topic modeling framework, under which we find that the epileptic DG network organizes into disjoint, cell-type specific pathological ensembles, a subset of which are recruited by each IED. We found that statistics of this ensemble structure are highly conserved across animals, with abGCs disproportionately driving network activity in the epileptic DG during IEDs. Our results provide the first in vivo characterization of activity dynamics of identified GC subpopulations in the epileptic DG, the first microcircuit-level correlates of IEDs in vivo, and reveal a specific contribution of abGCs to interictal epileptic events.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe relate electrographic signatures of epilepsy to microcircuit dynamics at single-cell resolution\nC_LIO_LIThe chronically epileptic dentate gyrus granule cell network is organized in lineage-specific pathological ensembles\nC_LIO_LIA novel generative model framework for ensemble recruitment relates local field potential signatures to microcircuit activation during interictal epileptiform discharges\nC_LIO_LIAdult-born granule cell-dominated ensembles are disproportionately represented among the inferred ensembles\nC_LIO_LIThe most active ensemble during an interictal epileptiform discharge can be decoded directly from the local field potential spectrum\nC_LIO_LIThis Latent Ensemble Recruitment model of cell recruitment by interictal events is the first application of Bayesian topic modeling to in vivo two-photon calcium imaging data\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Casparian strips (CS) are cell wall modifications of vascular plants restricting extracellular free diffusion into and out the vascular system. This barrier plays a critical role in controlling the acquisition of nutrients and water necessary for normal plant development. CS are formed by the precise deposition of a band of lignin approximately 2 m wide and 150 nm thick spanning the apoplastic space between adjacent endodermal cells. Here, we identified a copper-containing protein, Uclacyanin1 (UCC1) that is sub-compartmentalised within the CS. UCC1 forms a central CS nanodomain in comparison with other CS-located proteins that are found to be mainly accumulated at the periphery of the CS. We found that loss-of-function of two uclacyanins (UCC1 and UCC2) reduces lignification specifically in this central CS nanodomain, revealing a nano-compartmentalised machinery for lignin polymerisation. This lack of lignification leads to increased endodermal permeability, and consequently to a loss of mineral nutrient homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "It has been well documented that animals (and machines) swimming or flying near a solid boundary get a boost in performance1-6. This ground effect is often modeled as an interaction between a mirrored pair of vortices represented by a true vortex and an opposite sign  virtual vortex on the other side of the wall7. However, most animals do not swim near solid surfaces and thus near body vortex-vortex interactions in open-water swimmers have been poorly investigated. In this study we examine the most energetically efficient metazoan swimmer known to date, the jellyfish Aurelia aurita, to elucidate the role that vortex interactions can play in animals that swim away from solid boundaries. We used high speed video tracking, laser-based digital particle image velocimetry (dPIV) and an algorithm for extracting pressure fields from flow velocity vectors to quantify swimming performance and the effect of near body vortex-vortex interactions. Here we show that a vortex ring (stopping vortex), created underneath the animal during the previous swim cycle, is critical for increasing propulsive performance. This well positioned stopping vortex acts in the same way as a virtual vortex during wall-effect performance enhancement, by helping converge fluid at the underside of the propulsive surface and generating significantly higher pressures which result in greater thrust. These findings advocate that jellyfish can generate a wall-effect boost in open water by creating what amounts to a  virtual wall between two real, opposite sign vortex rings. This explains the significant propulsive advantage jellyfish possess over other metazoans and represents important implications for bio-engineered propulsion systems.",

Diffusible hormones frequently control the production of such metabolites by binding TetR family transcriptional repressors (TFTRs), but the molecular basis for this remains unclear.

We also elucidate the mechanism for DNA release upon hormone binding by single particle cryo-electron microscopy of an MmfR-operator complex.

    "abstract": "Cadherin cell-cell adhesion proteins play key roles in tissue morphogenesis and wound healing. Cadherin ectodomains bind in two conformations, X-dimers and strand-swap dimers, with different adhesive properties. However, the mechanisms by which cells regulate ectodomain conformation are unknown. Cadherin intracellular regions associate with several actin-binding proteins including vinculin, which are believed to tune cell-cell adhesion by remodeling the actin cytoskeleton. Here, we show at the single molecule level, that vinculin association with the cadherin cytoplasmic region allosterically converts weak X-dimers into strong strand-swap dimers, and that this process is mediated by myosin II dependent changes in cytoskeletal tension. We also show that in epithelial cells, [~]70% of apical cadherins exist as strand-swap dimers while the remaining form X-dimers, providing two cadherin pools with different adhesive properties. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, the inside-out regulation of cadherin conformation and establish a mechanistic role for vinculin in this process.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTCadherin cell-cell adhesion proteins play key roles in the formation and maintenance of tissues. Their adhesion is carefully regulated to orchestrate complex movement of cells. While cadherin ectodomains bind in two conformations with different adhesive properties, the mechanisms by which cells regulate the conformation (and consequently adhesion) of individual cadherins are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the association of intracellular vinculin to the cadherin cytoplasmic region, regulates cadherin adhesion by switching ectodomains from a weak binding to the strongly adhesive conformation. In contrast with the prevailing view which suggests that vinculin regulates adhesion solely by remodeling the cytoskeleton, we show that vinculin can directly modulate single cadherin ectodomain conformation and that this process is mediated by changes in cytoskeletal tension.",

    "abstract": "Polarized morphogenesis is achieved by targeting or inhibiting growth at distinct regions. Rod-shaped fission yeast cells grow exclusively at their ends by restricting exocytosis and secretion to these sites. This growth pattern implies the existence of mechanisms that prevent exocytosis and growth along non-growing cell sides. We previously identified a set of 50-100 megadalton-sized node structures along the sides of fission yeast cells that contain the interacting proteins Skb1 and Slf1. Here, we show that Skb1-Slf1 nodes contain the syntaxin-like SNARE Psy1, which mediates exocytosis in fission yeast. Psy1 localizes in a diffuse pattern at cell tips where it likely promotes exocytosis and growth, but Psy1 is sequestered in Skb1-Slf1 nodes at cell sides where growth does not occur. Mutations that prevent node assembly or inhibit Psy1 localization to nodes lead to aberrant exocytosis at cell sides and increased cell width. Genetic results indicate that this Psy1 node mechanism acts in parallel to actin cables and Cdc42 regulation. Our work suggests that sequestration of syntaxin-like Psy1 at non-growing regions of the cell cortex reinforces cell morphology by restricting exocytosis to proper sites of polarized growth.",

We aim to improve open-loop sacral neuromodulation therapy by developing a conditional stimulation paradigm using neural recordings from dorsal root ganglia (DRG) as sensory feedback. Experiments were performed in 5 anesthetized felines. We implemented a Kalman filter-based algorithm to estimate the bladder pressure in real-time using sacral-level DRG neural recordings and initiated sacral root electrical stimulation when the algorithm detected an increase in bladder pressure. Closed-loop neuromodulation was performed during continuous cystometry and compared to bladder fills with continuous and no stimulation. Overall, closed-loop stimulation increased bladder capacity by 13.8% over no stimulation (p < 0.001) and reduced stimulation time versus continuous stimulation by 57.7%. High-confidence bladder single units had a reduced sensitivity during stimulation, with lower linear trendline fits and higher pressure thresholds for firing observed during stimulation trials. This study demonstrates the utility of decoding bladder pressure from neural activity for closed-loop control of sacral neuromodulation. An underlying mechanism for sacral neuromodulation may be a reduction in bladder sensory neuron activity during stimulation. Real-time validation during behavioral studies is necessary prior to clinical translation of closed-loop sacral neuromodulation.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to drugs of abuse produces robust transcriptional and epigenetic reorganization within brain reward circuits that outlives the direct effects of the drug and may contribute to addiction. DNA methylation is a covalent epigenetic modification that is altered following stimulant exposure and is critical for behavioral and physiological adaptations to drugs of abuse. Although activity-related loss of DNA methylation requires the Gadd45 (Growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible) gene family, very little is known about how this family regulates the activity of brain reward circuits or behavioral responses to drugs of abuse. Here, we combined genome-wide transcriptional profiling, pharmacological manipulations, electrophysiological measurements, and CRISPR tools with traditional knockout and behavioral approaches in rodent model systems to dissect the role of Gadd45b in dopamine-dependent epigenetic regulation and cocaine reward. We show that acute cocaine administration induces rapid upregulation of Gadd45b mRNA in the rat nucleus accumbens, and that knockout or site-specific CRISPR/Cas9 gene knockdown of Gadd45b blocks cocaine conditioned place preference. In vitro, dopamine treatment in primary striatal neurons increases Gadd45b mRNA expression through a dopamine receptor type 1 (DRD1)-dependent mechanism. Moreover, shRNA-induced Gadd45b knockdown decreases expression of genes involved in psychostimulant addiction, blocks induction of immediate early genes by DRD1 stimulation, and prevents DRD1-mediated changes in DNA methylation. Finally, we demonstrate that Gadd45b knockdown decreases striatal neuron action potential burst duration in vitro, without altering other electrophysiological characteristics. These results suggest that striatal Gadd45b functions as a dopamine-induced gene that is necessary for cocaine reward memory and DRD1-mediated transcriptional activity.",

    "abstract": "Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurological disorder of childhood onset that is characterised by the occurrence of motor and vocal tics. TS is associated with cortical-striatal-thalamic-cortical circuit [CSTC] dysfunction and hyper-excitability of cortical limbic and motor regions that are thought to lead to the occurrence of tics. Importantly, individuals with TS often report that their tics are preceded by  premonitory sensory/urge phenomena (PU) that are described as uncomfortable bodily sensations that precede the execution of a tic and are experienced as a strong urge for motor discharge. While tics are most often referred to as involuntary movements, it has been argued that tics should be viewed as voluntary movements that are executed in response to the presence of PU and bring temporary relief from the uncomfortable bodily sensations that are associated with PU. This issue remains unresolved but has very important implications for the design of clinical interventions for TS. To investigate this issue further, we conducted a study using electroencephalography (EEG). Specifically, we recorded movement-related EEG (mu and beta band oscillations) during (a) the immediate period leading up to the execution of voluntary movements by a group of individuals with TS and a group of matched healthy control participants, and (b) the immediate period leading up to the execution of a tic in a group of individuals with TS. We demonstrate that movement-related mu and beta band oscillations are not observed prior to tics in individuals with TS. We interpret this effect as reflecting the greater involvement of a network of brain areas, including the insular and cingulate cortices, basal ganglia nuclei, and the cerebellum, in the generation of tics in TS. We also show that beta-band desynchronization does occur when individuals with TS initiate voluntary movements, but, in contrast to healthy controls, desynchronization of mu-band oscillations is not observed during the execution of voluntary movements for individuals with TS. We interpret this finding as reflecting a dysfunction of physiological inhibition in TS, thereby contributing to an impaired ability to suppress neuronal populations that may compete with movement preparation processes.",

Whether the adult testis maintains a reserve progenitor population with repair or regenerative capacity remains uncertain.

We found that Tcf21+ cells are bipotential somatic progenitors present in fetal testis and ovary, maintain adult testis homeostasis during aging, and act as reserve somatic progenitors following injury. In vitro, Tcf21+ cells are multipotent mesenchymal progenitors which form multiple somatic lineages including Leydig and myoid cells.

    "abstract": "Background and aimsHepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a serious neurological complication in patients with liver cirrhosis. Nothing is known about the role of the meningeal lymphatic system in HE. We tested our hypothesis that enhancement of meningeal lymphatic drainage could decrease neuroinflammation and ameliorate HE.\n\nMethodsA 4-week bile duct ligation (BDL) model was used to develop cirrhosis with HE in rats. Brain inflammation in patients with HE was evaluated using archived GSE41919. Motor function of rats was assessed by the rotarod test. AAV8-VEGF-C was injected into the cisterna magna of BDL rats one day after surgery to induce meningeal lymphangiogenesis.\n\nResultsCirrhotic rats with HE showed significantly increased microglia activation in the middle region of the cortex (p<0.001) as well as increased neuroinflammation as indicated by significant increases in IL-1{beta}, INF{gamma}, TNF and Iba1 expression in at least one of the three regions of the cortex. Motor function was also impaired in rats with HE (p<0.05). Human brains of cirrhotic patients with HE also exhibited upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes (NF-{kappa}{beta}, Iba1, TNF and IL-1{beta}) (n=6). AAV8-VEGF-C injection significantly increased meningeal lymphangiogenesis (p=0.035) and tracer dye uptake in the anterior and middle regions of the cortex (p=0.006 & 0.003, respectively), their corresponding meninges (p=0.086 & 0.006, respectively) and the draining lymph nodes (p=0.02). Further, AAV8-VEGF-C decreased microglia activation (p<0.001) and neuroinflammation, and ameliorated motor dysfunction (p=0.024).\n\nConclusionPromoting meningeal lymphatic drainage and enhancing waste clearance improves HE. Manipulation of meningeal lymphangiogenesis could be a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of HE.",

    "abstract": "Rab18 has been linked to lipid metabolism and metabolic diseases in different model systems, but the mechanism of Rab18-mediated lipid droplet (LD) dynamics in muscle cells remains elusive. Here, we report that Rab18 plays an essential role in oleic acid (OA)-induced LD growth and formation in mouse myoblast cell line C2C12. Rab18 was translocated from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to LDs during the LD growth induced by OA in C2C12 cells, which was directly regulated by perilipin 2 (PLIN2), a LD resident protein. LD-associated Rab18 bound with the C terminus of PLIN2, and the LD localization of Rab18 was diminished after PLIN2 deletion. Moreover, loss of function of Rab18 led to less triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation and fewer but larger LD formation. In contrast, expression of wild type Rab18 and a constitutively active Rab18 (Q67L) mutant resulted in elevated TAG content and LD number. Furthermore, LD-associated Rab18 interacted with acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 3 (ACSL3) and in turn, promoted the LD localization of ACSL3, which may play an important role in the accumulation of TAG induced by OA. These data showed that Rab18 was recruited to LD after OA treatment, and formed a complex with PLIN2 and ACSL3, which contributes to TAG accumulating and LD growth.",

    "abstract": "The canonical Wnt signaling pathway serves as a hub connecting diverse cellular physiological processes, such as {beta}-catenin signaling, differentiation, growth, protein stability, macropinocytosis, and nutrient acquisition in lysosomes. We have proposed that sequestration of {beta}-catenin destruction complex components in multivesicular bodies (MVBs) is required for sustained canonical Wnt signaling. In this study, we investigated the events that follow activation of the canonical Wnt receptor Lrp6 using an APEX2-mediated proximity labeling approach. The Wnt co-receptor Lrp6 was fused to APEX2 and used to biotinylate targets that are recruited near the receptor during Wnt signaling at different time periods. Lrp6 proximity targets were identified by mass spectrometry, and revealed that many components of the ESCRT (Endocytic Sorting Components Required for Transport) machinery interacted with Lrp6 within 5 minutes of Wnt3a treatment. This supports the proposal of a central role of multivesicular endosomes in canonical Wnt signaling. Interestingly, proteomic analyses identified the Trk-fused gene (TFG), previously known to regulate the cell secretory pathway and to be rearranged in thyroid and lung cancers, as being strongly enriched in the proximity of Lrp6. We provide evidence that TFG specifically co-localized with MVBs after Wnt stimulation. TFG depletion with siRNA, or knock-out with CRISPR/Cas9, significantly reduced Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling in cell culture. In vivo, studies in the Xenopus system showed that TFG is required for endogenous Wnt-dependent embryonic patterning. The results suggest that the multivesicular endosomal machinery and the novel player TFG have important roles in Wnt signaling.\n\nSignificanceWnt/{beta}-catenin signaling is a conserved pathway involved in cell differentiation and in the regulation of many other processes, including cell growth and proliferation, macropinocytosis, and cell metabolism. Endocytosis is required to regulate Wnt signaling, but the precise factors at play are still elusive. Here, we describe a biotin-dependent proximity labeling approach using ascorbate peroxidase-tagged Lrp6, a Wnt co-receptor. Proteomic analysis of biotinylated-enriched targets identified numerous multivesicular endosome proteins that were recruited to the receptor shortly after addition of Wnt protein. Additionally, we identified the protein TFG as one of the strongest interactors with Lrp6. TFG co-localized with Wnt-induced multivesicular endosomes. Xenopus embryo assays revealed that TFG is required in vivo for canonical Wnt signaling.",

    "abstract": "Kinetoplastids are unicellular eukaryotic parasites responsible for human pathologies such as Chagas disease, sleeping sickness or Leishmaniasis1. They possess a single large mitochondrion, essential for the parasite survival2. In kinetoplastids mitochondrion, most of the molecular machineries and gene expression processes have significantly diverged and specialized, with an extreme example being their mitochondrial ribosomes3. These large complexes are in charge of translating the few essential mRNAs encoded by mitochondrial genomes4,5. Structural studies performed in Trypanosoma brucei already highlighted the numerous peculiarities of these mitoribosomes and the maturation of their small subunit3,6. However, several important aspects mainly related to the large subunit remain elusive, such as the structure and maturation of its ribosomal RNA3. Here, we present a cryo-electron microscopy study of the protozoans Leishmania tarentolae and Trypanosoma cruzi mitoribosomes. For both species, we obtained the structure of their mature mitoribosomes, complete rRNA of the large subunit as well as previously unidentified ribosomal proteins. Most importantly, we introduce the structure of an LSU assembly intermediate in presence of 16 identified maturation factors. These maturation factors act both on the intersubunit and solvent sides of the LSU, where they refold and chemically modify the rRNA and prevent early translation before full maturation of the LSU.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

Here, we evaluated its potency to selectively modulate the activity of nigral dopaminergic (DA) neurons through the canonical DREADD receptor hM4Di using TH-Cre rats. In males, 1 mg.kg-1 of C21 strongly increased nigral neurons activity in control animals, indicative of a significant off-target effect. Reducing the dose to 0.5 mg.kg-1 circumvented this aspecific effect, while activated the inhibitory DREADDs and selectively reduced nigral neurons firing.

Dietary protein is vital for fetus and mother but the effects of protein undernutrition on the maternal skeleton and skeletal muscles is largely unknown. We used mouse dams fed with normal (N, 20%) or low (L, 8%) protein diet during gestation and lactation and maintained on the same diets (NN, LL) or switched from low to normal (LN) during a 28d skeletal restoration period post lactation. Skeletal muscle morphology and neuromuscular junction integrity was not different between any of the groups. However, dams fed the low protein diet showed extensive bone loss by the end of lactation, followed by full skeletal recovery in NN dams, partial recovery in LN and poor bone recovery in LL dams. Primary osteoblasts from low protein diet fed mice showed decreased in vitro bone formation and decreased osteogenic marker gene expression; promoter methylation analysis by pyrosequencing showed no differences in Bmpr1a, Ptch1, Sirt1, Osx and Igf1r osteoregulators, while miR-26a, -34a and -125b expression was found altered in low protein fed mice.

Neural network, regression models, and ratiometric analysis were used to discriminate the cell states and extract several important biomarkers specific to differentiation or reprogramming.

The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is critical for reward valuation of gustatory signals, yet how the OFC adapts to obesogenic diets is poorly understood. Here we show that extended access to a cafeteria diet impairs astrocyte glutamate clearance, which leads to a heterosynaptic depression of GABA transmission onto pyramidal neurons of the OFC. This decrease in GABA tone is due to an increase in extrasynaptic glutamate, which acts via metabotropic glutamate receptors to liberate endocannabinoids. This impaired the induction of endocannabinoid-mediated long-term plasticity. In obese rats, this cascade of synaptic impairments was rescued by restoring astrocyte glutamate transport with the nutritional supplement, N-acetylcysteine.

Converging evidence indicates that age-related bioenergetic insufficiency increases the vulnerability of retinal ganglion cells to intraocular pressure. To investigate further, we used metabolomics and RNA-sequencing to examine early glaucoma in DBA/2J mice. We demonstrate an intraocular pressure-dependent decline in retinal pyruvate levels coupled to dysregulated glucose metabolism prior to detectable optic nerve degeneration. Oral supplementation of pyruvate strongly protected from neurodegeneration in pre-clinical models of glaucoma. We detected mTOR activation at the mechanistic nexus of neurodegeneration and metabolism. Rapamycin-induced inhibition of mTOR robustly prevented glaucomatous neurodegeneration.

Here, we established a Cre-ERT2-loxP based inducible RNAi-mediated gene silencing system in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of acute leukemias in vivo. Mimicking anti-cancer therapy in patients, gene inhibition was initiated in mice harboring orthotopic tumors. Fluorochrome guided, competitive in vivo trials identified a major tumor-maintaining potency of the MLL-AF4 fusion protein and validated MCL1 as vulnerability in some, but not all patients tumors. We could prove DUX4 to play an essential role in patients leukemias carrying the recently described DUX4-IGH translocation. By individualizing functional genomics in established tumors in vivo, our technique decisively complements the value chain of precision oncology. Being broadly applicable to tumors of all kinds, it will considerably reinforce personalizing anti-cancer treatment in the future.",

    "abstract": "Functional MRI (fMRI) study of naturalistic conditions, e.g. movie watching, usually focuses on shared responses across subjects. However, individual differences have been attracting increasing attention in search of group differences or associations with behavioral outcomes. Individual differences are typically studied by directly modeling the pair-wise intersubject correlation matrix or projecting the relations onto a single dimension. We contend that it is critical to examine whether there are one or more consistent responses underlying the whole sample, because multiple components, if exist, may undermine the intersubject relations using the previous methods. We propose to use principal component analysis (PCA) to examine the heterogeneity of brain responses across subjects and project the individual variability into higher dimensions. By analyzing an fMRI dataset of children and adults watching a cartoon movie, we showed evidence of two consistent responses in the supramarginal gyrus and other regions. While the first components in many regions represented a response pattern mostly in older children and adults, the second components mainly represented the younger children. The second components in the supramarginal network resembled a delayed version of the first PCs for 4 seconds (2 TR), indicating slower responses in the younger children than the older children and adults. The analyses highlight the importance of identifying multiple consistent responses in responses to naturalistic stimuli. This PCA-based approach could be complementary to the commonly used intersubject correlation to analyze movie watching data.",

    "abstract": "Neuropathic pain patients often experience innocuous cooling as excruciating pain. The cell and molecular basis of this cold allodynia is little understood. We used in vivo calcium imaging of sensory ganglia to investigate the activity of peripheral cold-sensing neurons in three mouse models of neuropathic pain: oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy, partial sciatic nerve ligation and ciguatera poisoning. In control mice, cold-sensing neurons were few in number and small in size. In neuropathic animals with cold allodynia, a set of normally silent large-diameter neurons became sensitive to cooling. Many silent cold-sensing neurons expressed the nociceptor markers NaV1.8 and CGRP. Ablating these neurons diminished cold allodynia. Blocking KV1 voltage-gated potassium channels was sufficient to trigger de novo cold sensitivity in silent cold-sensing neurons. Thus silent cold-sensing neurons are unmasked in diverse neuropathic pain states and cold allodynia results from peripheral sensitization caused by altered nociceptor excitability.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/073999v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (60K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e3aeforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3f40bdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b344baorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16540ef_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Severity of deficits and the degree of recovery have been associated with widespread network dysfunction, yet it is not clear how these behavioural and functional changes relate with the underlying structural white matter pathways. Here, we investigated whether recovery after unilateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) lesions was associated with structural white matter remodeling in the distributed frontoparietal network. Diffusion-weighted MRI was acquired in four macaque monkeys before the lesions and at 2-4 months post-lesion, after recovery of deficits in saccade selection of contralesional targets. Probabilistic tractography was used to reconstruct inter- and intra-hemispheric frontoparietal fiber tracts: bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and transcallosal fibers connecting bilateral PFC or bilateral posterior parietal cortex (PPC). After behavioural recovery, tract-specific fractional anisotropy in contralesional SLF and transcallosal PPC increased after small lesions and decreased after larger lesions compared to pre-lesion. These findings indicate that remote fiber tracts may provide optimal compensation after small PFC lesions. However, larger lesions may have induced widespread structural damage and hindered compensatory remodeling in the structural frontoparietal network.",

    "abstract": "Neuromodulation techniques such as Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) are a promising treatment for memory-related disorders including anxiety, addiction, and dementia. However, the outcome of these treatments appears to be paradoxical, as the use of these techniques can both disrupt and enhance memory even when applied to the same brain target. In this paper, we hypothesize that disruption and enhancement of memory through neuromodulation can be explained by the dropout of engram nodes. We used a convolutional neural network to classify handwritten digits and letters, applying dropout at different stages to simulate DBS effects on engrams. We showed that dropout applied during training improves the accuracy of prediction, whereas dropout applied during testing dramatically decreases accuracy of prediction, which mimics enhancement and disruption of memory, respectively. We further showed that transfer learning of neural networks with dropout had increased accuracy and rate of learning. Dropout during training provided a more robust \"skeleton\" network where transfer learning can be applied, mimicking the effects of chronic DBS on memory. Overall, we show that dropout of nodes can be a potential mechanism by which neuromodulation techniques such as DBS can both disrupt and enhance memory and provides a unique perspective on this paradox.",

Our data indicate a close relationship between frontal midline theta, central beta activity and the executive components of WM. The oscillatory counterparts of the executive components were associated with individual differences in verbal WM performance. In contrast, alpha activity was not related to the individual differences. The results demonstrate that executive components of WM, rather than short-term storage capacity, play the decisive role in individual WM capacity limits.",

    "abstract": "Homology-directed repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) can be a highly faithful pathway. Non-crossover repair dominates in mitotically growing cells, likely through a preference for synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA). While genetic studies highlight a key role for the RecQ helicase BLM/Rqh1 (in human and S. pombe cells, respectively) in promoting noncrossover repair, how homology-directed repair mechanism choice is orchestrated in time and space is not well understood. Here, we develop a microscopy-based assay in living fission yeast to determine the dynamics and kinetics of an engineered, site-specific interhomologue repair event. We observe highly efficient homology search and homology-directed repair in this system. Surprisingly, we find that the initial distance between the DSB and the donor sequence does not correlate with the duration of repair. Instead, we observe that repair is likely to involve multiple site-specific and Rad51-dependent co-localization events between the DSB and donor sequence, suggesting that efficient interhomologue repair in fission yeast often involves multiple strand invasion events. By contrast, we find that loss of Rqh1 leads to successful repair through a single strand invasion event, suggesting that multiple strand invasion cycles reflect ongoing SDSA. However, failure to repair is also more likely in rqh1{Delta} cells, which could reflect increased strand invasion at non-homologous sites. This work has implications for the molecular etiology of Bloom syndrome, caused by mutations in BLM and characterized by aberrant sister chromatid crossovers and inefficient repair.",

    "abstract": "Glycans are important regulators of cell and organismal physiology. This requires that the glycan biosynthesis be controlled to achieve specific cellular glycan profiles. Glycans are assembled in the Golgi apparatus on secretory cargoes that traverse it. The mechanisms by which the Golgi apparatus ensures cell- and cargo-specific glycosylation remain obscure. We investigated how the Golgi apparatus regulates glycosylation by studying biosynthesis of glycosphingolipids, glycosylated lipids with critical roles in signalling and differentiation. We identified the Golgi matrix protein GRASP55 as a controller of sphingolipid glycosylation by regulating the compartmentalized localization of key sphingolipid biosynthetic enzymes in the Golgi. GRASP55 controls the localization of the enzymes by binding to them and regulating their entry into peri-Golgi vesicles. Impairing GRASP55-enzyme interaction decompartmentalizes these enzymes, changes the substrate flux across competing glycosylation pathways that results in alteration of the cellular glycosphingolipid profile. This GRASP55 regulated pathway of enzyme compartmentalization allows cells to make cell density-dependent adaptations in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis to suit cell growth needs. Thus, the Golgi apparatus controls the cellular glycan (glycosphingolipid) profile by governing competition between biosynthetic reactions through regulated changes in enzyme compartmentalization.",

    "abstract": "Valiant [1] proposed to treat Darwinian evolution as a special kind of computational learning from statistical queries. The statistical queries represent a genotypes fitness over a distribution of challenges. And this distribution of challenges along with the best response to them specify a given abiotic environment or static fitness landscape. Valiants model distinguished families of environments that are \"adaptable-to\" from those that are not. But this model of evolution omits the vital ecological interactions between different evolving agents - it neglects the rich biotic environment that is central to the struggle for existence.\n\nIn this article, I extend algorithmic Darwinism to include the ecological dynamics of frequency-dependent selection as a population-dependent bias to the distribution of challenges that specify an environment. Thus, extended algorithmic Darwinism suggests extended statistical queries rather than just statistical queries as the appropriate model for eco-evo dynamics. This extended algorithmic Darwinism replaces simple invasion of wild-type by a mutant-type of higher scalar fitness with an evolutionary game between wild-type and mutant-type based on their frequency-dependent fitness function. To analyze this model, I develop a game landscape view of evolution, as a generalization of the classic fitness landscape approach.\n\nI show that this model of eco-evo dynamics on game landscapes can provide an exponential speed-up over the purely evolutionary dynamics of the strict algorithmic Darwinism. In particular, I prove that the Parity environment - which is known to be not adaptable-to under strict algorithmic Darwinism - is adaptable-to by eco-evo dynamics. Thus, the ecology of frequency-dependent selection does not just increase the tempo of evolution, but fundamentally transforms its mode. This happens even if frequency-dependence is restricted to short-time scales - such short bursts of frequency-dependent selection can have a transformative effect on the ability of populations to adapt to their environments in the long-term.\n\nUnlike typical learning algorithms, the eco-evo dynamic for adapting to the Parity environment does not rely on Gaussian elimination. Instead, the dynamics proceed by simple isotropic mutations and selection in finite populations of just two types (the resident wild-type and invading mutant). The resultant process has two stages: (1) a quick stage of point-mutations that moves the population to one of exponentially many local fitness peaks; followed by (2) a slower stage where each  step follows a double-mutation by a point-mutation. This second stage allows the population to hop between local fitness peaks to reach the unique global fitness peak in polynomial time. The evolutionary game dynamics of finite populations are essential for finding a short adaptive path to the global fitness peak during the second stage of the adaptation process. This highlights the rich interface between computational learning theory, analysis of algorithms, evolutionary games, and long-term evolution.",

    "abstract": "The internal workings of biological systems are notoriously difficult to understand. Due to the prevalence of noise and degeneracy in evolved systems, in many cases the workings of everything from gene regulatory networks to protein-protein interactome networks remain black boxes. One consequence of this black-box nature is that it is unclear at which scale to analyze biological systems to best understand their function. We analyzed the protein interactomes of over 1800 species, containing in total 8,782,166 protein-protein interactions, at different scales. We demonstrate the emergence of higher order  macroscales in these interactomes and that these biological macroscales are associated with lower noise and degeneracy and therefore lower uncertainty. Moreover, the nodes in the interactomes that make up the macroscale are more resilient compared to nodes that do not participate in the macroscale. These effects are more pronounced in interactomes of Eukaryota, as compared to Prokaryota. This points to plausible evolutionary adaptation for macroscales: biological networks evolve informative macroscales to gain benefits of both being uncertain at lower scales to boost their resilience, and also being  certain at higher scales to increase their effectiveness at information transmission. Our work explains some of the difficulty in understanding the workings of biological networks, since they are often most informative at a hidden higher scale, and demonstrates the tools to make these informative higher scales explicit.",

Average Abf1 residence times span a wide-range, varying between 4.5 and 37 minutes. Sites with different off-rates are associated with different functional characteristics. This includes their transcriptional dependency on Abf1, nucleosome positioning and the size of the nucleosome-free region, as well as the ability to roadblock RNA polymerase II for termination.

    "abstract": "Slide-free digital pathology techniques, including nondestructive 3D microscopy, are gaining interest as alternatives to traditional slide-based histology. In order to facilitate clinical adoption of these fluorescence-based techniques, software methods have been developed to convert grayscale fluorescence images into color images that mimic the appearance of standard absorptive chromogens such as hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E). However, these false-coloring algorithms often require manual and iterative adjustment of parameters, with results that can be inconsistent in the presence of intensity nonuniformities within an image and/or between specimens (intra- and inter-specimen variability). Here, we present an open-source (Python-based) rapid intensity-leveling and digital-staining package that is specifically designed to render two-channel fluorescence images (i.e. a fluorescent analog of H&amp;E) to the traditional H&amp;E color space for 2D and 3D microscopy datasets. However, this method can be easily tailored for other false-coloring needs. Our package offers (1) automated and uniform false coloring in spite of uneven staining within a large thick specimen, (2) consistent color-space representations that are robust to variations in staining and imaging conditions between different specimens, and (3) GPU-accelerated data processing to allow these methods to scale to large datasets. We demonstrate this platform by generating H&amp;E-like images from cleared tissues that are fluorescently imaged in 3D with open-top light-sheet (OTLS) microscopy, and quantitatively characterizing the results in comparison to traditional slide-based H&amp;E histology.Competing Interest StatementA.K.G. and J.T.C.L. are co-founders and shareholders of Lightspeed Microscopy Inc.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Malaria represents a life-threatening disease caused by the obligate intra-erythrocytic protozoa of the Plasmodium genus, exerting a sinister global health burden and accounting for approximately 660,000 deaths annually. Additionally, 219 million new cases are reported each year, most of which result from the growing issue of artemisinin resistance shown by the Plasmodium parasite. Much of the research done for the purpose of development of therapeutics against malaria has traditionally been focused on Plasmodium falciparum, which is responsible for majority of the cases of mortality due to malaria, Plasmodium vivax is also known to contribute greatly towards the malaria relate morbidities particularly in vivax endemic areas. In this study, we have used two different computational approaches aimed at establishing newer concepts towards the development of advanced therapeutics against vivax malaria by targeting the surface antigen, merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1). In-silico approach involving computational siRNA designing against MSP-1 resulted in a total of four candidate siRNAs being rationally validated following corroboration with a plethora of algorithms. Additionally, molecular docking analysis unraveled a total of three anti-parasitic peptides. These peptides namely: AP02283, AP02285 and AP00101 were found to exhibit considerable binding affinity with MSP-1 of P.vivax, thus providing an apparent indication of their anti-malarial property and affirming their potency to be used as novel molecules for development of next generation anti-malarials. However, irrespective of the prospective magnitude of these in-silico findings, the results require extensive validation by further rigorous laboratory experiments involving both in-vitro and in-vivo approaches.",

    "abstract": "Trypanosoma brucei causes African sleeping sickness, a fatal human disease. Its differentiation from replicative slender form into quiescent stumpy form promotes host survival and parasite transmission. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are known to regulate cell differentiation. To determine whether lncRNAs are involved in parasite differentiation we used RNAseq to survey the T. brucei lncRNA gene repertoire, identifying 1,428 previously uncharacterized lncRNA genes. We analysed grumpy, a lncRNA located immediately upstream of an RNA-binding protein that is a key differentiation regulator. Grumpy over-expression resulted in premature parasite differentiation into the quiescent stumpy form, and subsequent impairment of in vivo infection, decreasing parasite load in the mammalian host, and increasing host survival. Our analyses suggest Grumpy is one of many lncRNA that modulate parasite-host interactions, and lncRNA roles in cell differentiation are probably commonplace in T. brucei.",

    "abstract": "This research will explore the phenotype-genotype gap by bringing two very diverse technologies together to predict plant characteristics. Currently, there are several studies and tools available for plant phenotype and genotype analysis. However, there is no existing single system that offers both capabilities in one package. Usually, Convolution Neural Networks used for plant phenotyping analysis and Recurrent Neural Networks used for genotype analysis. Both of these machine leanring methods require different input data for feature extraction, analysis and learning. Building a machine learning system for plant data that can make use of both graphic (for phenotype) and time-series (for genotype) is critical and challenging, especially when the system has to predict sensitive information regarding plant growth, accession and types. In this study, the proposed system will solve these problems by bringing two very different technologies, analysis methods and datasets. The proposed research aims to bridge the phenotype-genotype gap using CNN-LSTMs to process graphic and temporal data of plant roots. The proposed system \"PhenomNet\" offers segmentation of plant roots along with the classification of the given dataset into different accessions. The experiment results have shown that proposed CNN-LSTM architecture provides very high accuracy in comparison to manual or semi-automated approaches.",

    "abstract": "Compared to other stages in the RNA polymerase II transcription cycle, the role of chromatin in transcription termination is poorly understood. Through a genetic screen, we identified histone mutant strains that exhibit transcriptional readthrough of terminators in vivo. Amino acid subtitutions map to the nucleosome DNA entry-exit site. On a genome-wide scale, the strongest H3 mutants revealed increased sense-strand transcription upstream and downstream of Pol II transcribed genes, increased antisense transcription overlapping gene bodies, and reduced nucleosome occupancy particularly at the 3 ends of genes. Replacement of the native sequence downstream of a gene with a sequence that increases nucleosome occupancy in vivo reduced readthrough transcription and suppressed the effect of a DNA entry-exit site substitution. Our results suggest that nucleosomes can facilitate termination by serving as a barrier to RNA polymerase II progression and highlight the importance of the DNA entry-exit site in maintaining the integrity of the transcriptome.",

Yet, many morphological findings elude the human eye. Here, we extracted visual features of 236 MDS, 87 MDS/MPN, and 10 control BM biopsies with convolutional neural networks. Unsupervised analysis distinguished underlying correlations between tissue composition, leukocyte metrics, and clinical characteristics. We applied morphological features in elastic net-regularized regression models to predict genetic and cytogenetic aberrations, prognosis, and clinical variables. By parallelizing tile, pixel, and leukocyte-level image analysis, we deconvoluted each model to texture and cellular composition to dissect their pathobiological context. Model-based mutation predictions correlated with variant allele frequency and number of affected genes per pathway, demonstrating the models ability to identify relevant visual patterns. In summary, this study highlights the potential of deep histopathology in hematology by unveiling the fundamental association of BM morphology with genetic and clinical determinants.",

    "abstract": "This article examines biodiversity research and innovation in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean based on a review of 150,401 scientific articles and 29,690 patent families for Antarctic species. The paper exploits the growing availability of open access databases, such as the Lens and Microsoft Academic Graph, along with taxonomic data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) to explore the scientific and patent literature for the Antarctic at scale. The paper identifies the main contours of scientific research in Antarctica before exploring commercially oriented biodiversity research and development in the scientific literature and patent publications. The paper argues that biodiversity is not a free good and must be paid for. Ways forward in debates on commercial research and development in Antarctica can be found through increasing attention to the valuation of ecosystem services, new approaches to natural capital accounting and payment for ecosystem services that would bring the Antarctic, and the Antarctic Treaty System, into the wider fold of work on the economics of biodiversity. Economics based approaches can be criticised for reducing biodiversity to monetary exchange values at the expense of recognition of the wider values of biodiversity and its services. However, approaches grounded in the economics of biodiversity provide a transparent framework for approaching commercial activity in the Antarctic and introducing requirements for investments in the conservation of Antarctic biodiversity by those who seek to profit from it.",

    "abstract": "Goal-directed motor corrections are surprisingly fast and complex, but little is known on how they are generated by the central nervous system. Here we show that temporary cooling of dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) or parietal area 5 (A5) in behaving monkeys caused impairments in corrective responses to mechanical perturbations of the forelimb. Deactivation of PMd impaired both spatial accuracy and response speed, whereas deactivation of A5 impaired spatial accuracy, but not response speed. Simulations based on optimal feedback control demonstrated that  deactivation of the control policy (reduction of feedback gain) impaired both spatial accuracy and response speed, whereas  deactivation in state estimation (reduction of Kalman gain) impaired spatial accuracy but not response speed, paralleling the impairments observed from deactivation of PMd and A5, respectively. Furthermore, combined deactivation of both cortical regions led to additive impairments of individual deactivations, whereas reducing the amount of cooling (i.e. milder cooling) to PMd led to impairments in response speed, but not spatial accuracy, both also predicted by the model simulations. These results provide causal support that higher order motor and somatosensory regions beyond primary somatosensory and primary motor cortex are involved in generating goal-directed motor responses. As well, the computational models suggest that the distinct patterns of impairments associated with these cortical regions reflect their unique functional roles in goal-directed feedback control.",

    "abstract": "The recurrent and recent global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has turned into a global concern which has infected more than 19-million people all over the globe, and this number is increasing in hours. Unfortunate no vaccine or specific treatment is available, which make it more deadly. A vaccine-informatics approach has shown significant breakthrough in peptide-based epitope mapping and opens the new horizon in vaccine development. In this study, we have identified a total of 15 antigenic peptides (including T and B cells) in the surface glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 which showed non-toxic nature, non-allergenic, highly antigenic and non-mutated in other SARS-CoV-2 virus strains. The population coverage analysis has found that CD4+ T-cell peptides showed higher cumulative population coverage over to CD8+ peptides in the 16 different geographical regions of the world. We identified twelve peptides (LTDEMIAQY, WTAGAAAYY, WMESEFRVY, IRASANLAA, FGAISSVLN, VKQLSSNFG, FAMQMAYRF, FGAGAALQI, YGFQPTNGVGYQ, LPDPSKPSKR, QTQTNSPRRARS and VITPGTNTSN) that are 80% - 90% identical with experimentally determined epitopes of SARS-CoV, and this will likely be beneficial for a quick progression of the vaccine design. Moreover, docking analysis suggested that identified peptides are tightly bound in the groove of HLA molecules which can induce the T-cell response. Overall this study allows us to determine potent peptide antigen targets in surface glycoprotein on intuitive grounds which open up a new horizon in COVID-19 research. However, this study needs experimental validation by in vitro and in vivo.",

Characterization of the genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial in following and evaluating it spread across countries. In this study, we collected and analyzed 3,067 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from 55 countries during the first three months after the onset of this virus. Using comparative genomics analysis, we traced the profiles of the whole-genome mutations and compared the frequency of each mutation in the studied population. The accumulation of mutations during the epidemic period with their geographic locations was also monitored. The results showed 782 variant sites, of which 512 (65.47%) had a non-synonymous effect. Frequencies of mutated alleles revealed the presence of 38 recurrent non-synonymous mutations, including ten hotspot mutations with a prevalence higher than 0.10 in this population and distributed in six SARS-CoV-2 genes. The distribution of these recurrent mutations on the world map revealed certain genotypes specific to the geographic location. We also found co-occurring mutations resulting in the presence of several haplotypes. Moreover, evolution over time has shown a mechanism of mutation co-accumulation which might affect the severity and spread of the SARS-CoV-2.\n\nOn the other hand, analysis of the selective pressure revealed the presence of negatively selected residues that could be taken into considerations as therapeutic targets\n\nWe have also created an inclusive unified database (http://genoma.ma/covid-19/) that lists all of the genetic variants of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes found in this study with phylogeographic analysis around the world.",

    "abstract": "Neutralizing antibody is one of the most effective interventions for acute pathogenic infection. Currently, over three million people have been identified for SARS-CoV-2 infection but SARS-CoV-2-specific vaccines and neutralizing antibodies are still lacking. SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells by interacting with angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) via the S1 receptor-binding domain (RBD) of its surface spike glycoprotein. Therefore, blocking the interaction of SARS-CoV-2-RBD and ACE2 by antibody would cause a directly neutralizing effect against virus. In the current study, we selected the ACE2 interface of SARS-CoV-2-RBD as the targeting epitope for neutralizing antibody screening. We performed site-directed screening by phage display and finally obtained one IgG antibody (4A3) and several domain antibodies. Among them, 4A3 and three domain antibodies (4A12, 4D5, and 4A10) were identified to act as neutralizing antibodies due to their capabilities to block the interaction between SARS-CoV-2-RBD and ACE2-positive cells. The domain antibody 4A12 was predicted to have the best accessibility to all three ACE2-interfaces on the spike homotrimer. Pseudovirus and authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays showed that all four antibodies could potently protect host cells from virus infection. Overall, we isolated multiple formats of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies via site-directed antibody screening, which could be promising candidate drugs for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.",

Spatial mapping of differentiation transitions revealed the intricate interplay between cellular differentiation and morphogenesis in cardiac cellular lineages.

    "abstract": "Typically, humans contract leptospirosis through exposure to soil or water contaminated with the urine of infected animals. Specifically, people working in inundated fields, engaged in aquatic sports, or exposed to contaminated floodwater after periods of heavy rainfall bear the risk of contracting leptospirosis. There is a critical gap in the knowledge of the environmental cycle, transmission, and interaction of Leptospira species with its environment. A few studies establish the presence of higher concentration of leptospires during the rainy season when compared to the dry season. Therefore, we assessed the abundance of leptospires during the dry and wet months and their interaction with other microbes. The overall detection rate of leptospires in paddy field for the test period was 52 (49.5%). Leptospiral concentration positively correlated with the amount of rainfall (mm) during the sampling when compared to months that received comparatively less rainfall (60% vs. 28.5%, respectively). When observed for the microbial interaction, Leptospira showed significant negative correlation with Pseudomonas and rainfall in the paddy field. Moreover, Pseudomonas negatively correlated with the amount of rainfall. Corroborative results of in-vitro studies suggest the antagonistic effect of Pseudomonas spp. on leptospires. The results indicate that seasonal changes influence the diversity of free-living well-adaptive aquatic antagonistic microbe populations and may in turn determine the survival of Leptospira in the environment. Thus, microbial interaction can be the possible enigma for the fluctuation of Leptospira count in rainy and dry seasons in environmental surface water, which needs to be further confirmed. This will pave way for a better understanding of the survival of leptospires and the seasonal trend of exposure to humans.",

    "abstract": "The trp operon of Chlamydia trachomatis has a genetic organization that is distinct from other model bacteria. The operon contains the trpR open-reading frame (ORF), an intergenic region (IGR), and the trpB and trpA ORFs. TrpR mediates tryptophan-dependent regulation of the operon from the major promoter upstream of trpR(PtrpR). We recently reported that trpBA is additionally regulated by the iron-dependent repressor YtgR via an operator sequence within the IGR upstream of an alternative promoter for TrpR-independent trpBA expression (PtrpBA). Here we report that YtgR repression of PtrpBA is also dependent on tryptophan levels via a rare triple-tryptophan motif (WWW) in the N-terminal permease domain of the YtgCR precursor. Tryptophan limitation inhibits translation at the WWW motif and subsequently promotes transcription termination of ytgCR in a Rho-independent manner. This regulatory schematic resembles mechanisms of transcriptional attenuation for trp operons described in model bacteria, such as cis-attenuation by TrpL in E. coli or trans-attenuation by TRAP in B. subtilis. YtgR performs an analogous function by sensing both iron and tryptophan levels, with the latter highlighting the unique strategy of Chlamydia to retain a trans-attenuator mechanism for regulating expression of the trpRBA operon.",

    "abstract": "At least 250 million people worldwide suffer from schistosomiasis, caused by Schistosoma worms. Genome sequences for several Schistosoma species are available, including a high-quality annotated reference for Schistosoma mansoni. There is a pressing need to develop a reliable functional toolkit to translate these data into new biological insights and targets for intervention. CRISPR-Cas9 was recently demonstrated for the first time in S. mansoni, to produce somatic mutations in the omega-1 ({omega}1) gene. Here, we employed CRISPR-Cas9 to introduce somatic mutations in a second gene, SULT-OR, a sulfotransferase expressed in the parasitic stages of S. mansoni, in which mutations confer resistance to the drug oxamniquine. A 262-bp PCR product spanning the region targeted by the gRNA against SULT-OR was amplified, and mutations identified in it by high-throughput sequencing. We found that 0.3-2.0% of aligned reads from CRISPR-Cas9-treated adult worms showed deletions spanning the predicted Cas9 cut site, compared to 0.1-0.2% for sporocysts, while deletions were extremely rare in eggs. The most common deletion observed in adults and sporocysts was a 34 bp-deletion directly upstream of the predicted cut site, but rarer deletions reaching as far as 102 bp upstream of the cut site were also detected. The CRISPR-Cas9-induced deletions, if homozygous, are predicted to cause resistance to oxamniquine by producing frameshifts, ablating SULT-OR transcription, or leading to mRNA degradation via the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway. However, no SULT-OR knock down at the mRNA level was observed, presumably because the cells in which CRISPR-Cas9 did induce mutations represented a small fraction of all cells expressing SULT-OR. Further optimisation of CRISPR-Cas protocols for different developmental stages and particular cell types, including germline cells, will contribute to the generation of a homozygous knock-out in any gene of interest, and in particular the SULT-OR gene to derive an oxamniquine-resistant stable transgenic line.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 50% of human cutaneous melanomas carry activating mutations in the serine/threonine protein kinase BRAF. BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) selectively target the oncogenic BRAFV600E/K and are effective in approximately 80% of patients carrying the mutation. However, resistance to BRAFi is common and emerges within a median time of 6-7 months of treatment and is prolonged to 11 months when combined with MEK inhibitors. Better characterization of the underlying molecular processes is therefore needed to further improve treatments. Inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN has been suggested to occur during melanomagenesis and drug resistance development. We recently demonstrated that transcription of PTEN is negatively regulated by an antisense RNA from the PTEN pseudogene (PTENP1-AS) and here set out to investigate the impact of this molecular pathway on the resistance to BRAFi and clinical outcome. We used a panel of BRAFi resistant A375 sublines, and observed increased levels of PTENP1-AS associated with reduced expression of PTEN. Furthermore, this loss of PTEN expression was correlated to increased recruitment of Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and formation of the transcriptional repression mark H3K27me3 at the PTEN promoter in the resistant cells. We demonstrated that targeting of PTENP1-AS was able to re-activate the expression of PTEN and sensitize resistant melanoma cells to BRAFi. Finally, we showed that PTENP1-AS is a promising prognostic marker for clinical outcome in melanoma patients as high expression of PTENP1-AS in regional lymph node metastases from stage III melanoma patients correlated with poor survival.",

    "abstract": "MotivationIn the last two decades, scientists working in different labs have assayed gene expression from millions of samples. These experiments can be combined into compendia and analyzed collectively to extract novel biological patterns. Technical variability, sometimes referred to as batch effects, may result from combining samples collected and processed at different times and in different settings. Such variability may distort our ability to interpret and extract true underlying biological patterns. As more multi-experiment, integrative analysis methods are developed and available data collections increase in size, it is crucial to determine how technical variability affect our ability to detect desired patterns when many experiments are combined\n\nObjectiveWe sought to determine the extent to which an underlying signal was masked by technical variability by simulating compendia comprised of data aggregated across multiple experiments.\n\nMethodWe developed a generative multi-layer neural network to simulate compendia of gene expression experiments from large-scale microbial and human datasets. We compared simulated compendia before and after introducing varying numbers of sources of undesired variability.\n\nResultsWe found that the signal from a baseline compendium was obscured when the number of added sources of variability was small. Perhaps as expected, applying statistical correction methods rescued the underlying signal in these cases. As the number of sources of variability increased, surprisingly, we observed that detecting the original signal became increasingly easier even without correction. In fact, applying statistical correction methods reduced our power to detect the underlying signal.\n\nConclusionWhen combining a modest number of experiments, it is best to correct for experiment-specific noise. However, when many experiments are combined, statistical correction reduces ones ability to extract underlying patterns.",

    "abstract": "The YdhB transcriptional factor, re-named here AdnB, homologous to the allantoin regulator, AllS, was shown to regulate ydhC gene expression in Escherichia coli, which is divergently transcribed from adnB, and this gene arrangement is conserved in many Protreobacteria. The predicted consensus DNA binding sequence for YdhB is also conserved in Entrobacterial genomes. RNA-seq data confirmed the activation predicted due to the binding of AdnB as shown by Chip-Exo results. Fluorescent polarization experiments revealed binding of YdhB to the predicted binding site upstream of ydhC in the presence of 0.35 mM adenine, but not in its absence. The E. coli MG1655, strain lacking the ydhB gene, showed a lower level of ydhC mRNA in cells grown in M9-glucose supplemented with 2 mM adenosine. Adenosine and adenine are products of purine metabolism and provide sources of ammonium for many organisms. They are utilized under nitrogen starvation conditions as single nitrogen sources. Deletion of either the ydhC or the ydhB gene leads to a substantially decreased growth rate for E. coli in minimal M9 medium with glycerol as the carbon source and adenosine or adenine as the single nitrogen source. The ydhC mutant showed increased resistance to Paromomycine, Sulfathiazole and Sulfamethohazole using Biolog plates. We provide evidence that YdhB, (a novel LysR family regulator) activates expression of the ydhC gene, encoding a novel adenosine/adenine transporter in E. coli. The YdhB binding consensus for different groups of Enterobacteria was predicted.",
