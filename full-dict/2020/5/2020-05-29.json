    "abstract": "Iron (Fe) and phosphorus (P) are the essential mineral nutrient for plant growth and development. However, the molecular interaction of the Fe and P pathways in crops remained largely obscure. In this study, we provide a comprehensive physiological and molecular analysis of hexaploid wheat response to single (Fe, P) and its combinatorial deficiencies. Our data showed that inhibition of the primary root growth occurs in response to Fe deficiency; however, growth was rescued when combinatorial deficiencies occurred. Analysis of RNAseq revealed that distinct molecular rearrangements during combined deficiencies with predominance for genes related to metabolic pathways and secondary metabolite biosynthesis primarily include genes for UDP-glycosyltransferase, cytochrome-P450s, and glutathione metabolism. Interestingly, the Fe-responsive cis-regulatory elements in the roots in Fe stress conditions were enriched compared to the combined stress. Our metabolome data also revealed the accumulation of distinct metabolites such as amino-isobutyric acid, arabinonic acid, and aconitic acid in the combined stress environment. Overall, these results are essential in developing new strategies to improve the resilience of crops in limited nutrients.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThis study was performed to understand the molecular changes occurring during the interaction of Phosphorus (P) and Iron (Fe) in hexaploid wheat roots.\nC_LIO_LIP and Fe show cross-talk as Fe deficiency-induced phenotype that was restored by the withdrawal of P.\nC_LIO_LIA total of 2780 differentially expressed genes were identified in the roots with the combined -Fe-P deficiencies with predominance for UDP-glycosyltransferases, cytochrome-450 and glutathione-S-transferases transcripts.\nC_LIO_LIThe metabolomic changes identified the importance of amino-isobutyric acid, arabinonic acid and aconitic acid during dual deficiency\nC_LIO_LIThis work provides a comprehensive insight to understand the molecular rearrangements occurring in wheat roots during Fe and P interaction.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Observations made from papers submitted to preprint servers, and the speculation of editors on social media platforms, suggest that women are submitting fewer papers to scholarly journals than are men during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here I examine whether submissions by men and women to six ecology journals (all published by the British Ecological Society) have changed since the start of COVID disruptions. At these six ecology journals there is no evidence of a decline in the proportion of submissions that are authored by women (as either first or submitting author) since the start of the COVID-19 disruptions; the proportion of papers authored by women in the post-COVID period of 2020 has increased relative to the same period in 2019, and is higher than in the period pre-COVID in 2020. There is also no evidence of a change in the geographic pattern of submissions from across the globe.Competing Interest StatementCharles Fox is Executive Editor of Functional Ecology, one of the journals that contributed data for the analyses presented in this paper.View Full Text",
