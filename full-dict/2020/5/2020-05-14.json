    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, encoding an anion channel that conducts chloride and bicarbonate across epithelial membranes. Mutations that disrupt pre-mRNA splicing occur in more than 15% of CF cases. One common CFTR splicing mutation is CFTR c.3718-2477C>T (3849+10kbC>T), which creates a new 5 splice site, resulting in splicing to a cryptic exon with a premature termination codon. Splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) have emerged as an effective therapeutic strategy to block aberrant splicing. We test an ASO targeting the CFTR c.3718-2477C>T mutation and show that it effectively blocks aberrant splicing in primary bronchial epithelial (hBE) cells from CF patients with the mutation. ASO treatment results in long-term improvement in CFTR activity in hBE cells, as demonstrated by a recovery of chloride secretion and apical membrane conductance. We also show that the ASO is more effective at recovering chloride secretion in our assay than ivacaftor, the potentiator treatment currently available to these patients. Our findings demonstrate the utility of ASOs in correcting CFTR expression and channel activity in a manner expected to be therapeutic in patients.",

    "abstract": "The folding landscape of proteins can change during evolution with the accumulation of mutations that may introduce entropic or enthalpic barriers in the protein folding pathway, making it a possible substrate of molecular chaperones in vivo. Can the nature of such physical barriers of folding dictate the feasibility of chaperone-assistance? To address this, we have simulated the evolutionary step to chaperone-dependence keeping GroEL/ES as the target chaperone and GFP as a model protein in an unbiased screen. We find that the mutation conferring GroEL/ES dependence in vivo and in vitro encode an entropic trap in the folding pathway rescued by the chaperonin. Additionally, GroEL/ES can edit the formation of non-native contacts similar to DnaK/J/E machinery. However, this capability is not utilized by the substrates in vivo. As a consequence, GroEL/ES caters to buffer mutations that predominantly cause entropic traps, despite possessing the capacity to edit both enthalpic and entropic traps in the folding pathway of the substrate protein.",

    "abstract": "Brain-machine interfaces (BMI) are powerful devices for restoring function to people living with paralysis. Leveraging significant advances in neurorecording technology, computational power, and understanding of the underlying neural signals, BMI have enabled severely paralyzed patients to control external devices, such as computers and robotic limbs. However, high-performance BMI currently require highly invasive recording techniques, and are thus only available to niche populations. Here, we show that a minimally invasive neuroimaging approach based on functional ultrasound (fUS) imaging can be used to detect and decode movement intention signals usable for BMI. We trained non-human primates to perform memory-guided movements while using epidural fUS imaging to record changes in cerebral blood volume from the posterior parietal cortex - a brain area important for spatial perception, multisensory integration, and movement planning. Using hemodynamic signals acquired during movement planning, we classified left-cued vs. right-cued movements, establishing the feasibility of ultrasonic BMI. These results demonstrate the ability of fUS-based neural interfaces to take advantage of the excellent spatiotemporal resolution, sensitivity, and field of view of ultrasound without breaching the dura or physically penetrating brain tissue.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is a growing hallmark of perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PNDs), including delirium and longer-lasting cognitive deficits. We have developed a clinically-relevant orthopedic mouse model to study the impact of a common surgical procedure on the vulnerable brain. The mechanism underlying PNDs remain unknown. Here we evaluated the impact of surgical trauma on the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling, including the expression of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), caspase-1, and IL-1{beta} in the hippocampus of C57BL6/J male mice, adult (3-months) and aged (>18-months). Surgery triggered ASC specks formation in CA1 hippocampal microglia, but without inducing significant morphological changes in NLRP3 and ASC knockout mice. Since no therapies are currently available to treat PNDs, we assessed the neuroprotective effects of a biomimetic peptide derived from the endogenous inflammation-ending molecule, Annexin-A1 (ANXA1). We tested the hypothesis that this peptide (ANXA1sp) inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation, thus preventing microglial activation and hippocampal-dependent memory deficits. Together these results uncover a previously underrecognized role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in triggering postoperative neuroinflammation and offer a new target for advancing treatment of PNDs through resolution of inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Life threatening fear after a single exposure evolves in a subset of vulnerable individuals to anxiety, which may persist for their lifetime. Yet neither the whole brains response to innate acute fear nor how brain activity evolves over time is known. Sustained neuronal activity may be a factor in the development of anxiety. We couple two experimental protocols to obtain a fear response leading to anxiety. Predator stress (PS) is a naturalistic approach that induces fear in rodents; and the serotonin transporter knockout (SERT-KO) mouse responds to PS with sustained defensive behavior. Behavior was monitored before, during and at short and long times after PS in WT and SERT-KO mice. Both genotypes responded to PS with defensive behavior, and SERT-KO retained defensive behavior for 23 days, while wild type (WT) mice return to baseline exploratory behavior by 9 days. Thus, differences in neural activity between WT and SERT-KO at 9 days after PS will identify neural correlates of persistent defensive behavior. We used longitudinal manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) to identify brain-wide neural activity between behavioral sessions. Mn2+ accumulation in active neurons occurs in awake behaving mice and is retrospectively imaged. To confirm expected effects of PS, behavior was monitored throughout. Following the same two cohorts of mice, WT and SERT-KO, longitudinally allowed unbiased quantitative comparisons of brain-wide activity by statistical parametric mapping (SPM). During natural behavior in WT, only low levels of activity-induced Mn2+-accumulation were detected, while much more accumulation appeared immediately after PS in both WT and SERT-KO, and evolved at 9 days to a new activity pattern at p<0.0001, uncorr., T=5.4. Patterns of accumulation differed between genotypes, with more regions of the brain and larger volumes within regions involved in SERT-KO than WT. A new computational segmentation analysis, using our InVivo Atlas based on a manganese-enhanced MR image of a living mouse, revealed dynamic changes in the volume of significantly enhanced voxels within each segment that differed between genotypes across 45 of 87 segmented regions. At Day 9 after PS, the striatum and ventral pallidum were active in both genotypes but more so in the anxious SERT-KO. SERT-KO also displayed sustained or increased volume of Mn2+ accumulation between Post-Fear and Day 9 in eight segments where activity was decreased or silenced in WT. Staining of the same mice fixed at the conclusion of imaging sessions for c-fos, a marker of neural activity, confirmed that MEMRI detected active neurons. Intensity measurements in 12 regions of interest (ROIs) supported the SPM results. Between group comparisons by SPM and of ROI measurements identified specific regions differing between time points and genotypes Thus we report brain-wide activity in response to a single exposure of acute fear, and, for the first time, its evolution to new activity patterns over time in individuals vulnerable to anxiety. Our results demonstrate the power of longitudinal MEMRI to discover how brain-wide activity evolves during recovery or persistence of fear responses leading to anxiety.",

We demonstrate a similar behavior of cells on mixed and fibrin threads with high adherence of tenoblasts and myoblasts, in comparison to collagen threads that promote high adherence and proliferation of tenoblasts but not of myoblasts. Besides, we show that myoblasts on threads differentiate but do not fuse, on the contrary to 2D control substrates, raising the question of the effect of substrate curvature on the ability of myoblasts to fuse in vitro.",

Although much progress has been made in understanding the development of neuroendocrine prostate cancer, the cellular architecture associated with neuroendocrine differentiation in human prostate cancer remain incompletely understood. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to profile the transcriptomes of 21,292 cells from needle biopsies of 6 castration-resistant prostate cancers. Our analyses reveal that all neuroendocrine tumor cells display a luminal-like epithelial phenotype. In particular, lineage trajectory analysis suggests that focal neuroendocrine differentiation exclusively originate from luminal-like malignant cells rather than basal compartment. Further tissue microarray analysis validates the generality of the luminal phenotype of neuroendocrine cells. Moreover, we uncover neuroendocrine differentiation-associated gene signatures that may help us to further explore novel intrinsic molecular mechanisms deriving neuroendocrine prostate cancer. In summary, our single-cell study provides direct evidence into the cellular states underlying neuroendocrine transdifferentiation in human prostate cancer.",

The BAMM and BiSSE analyses have been used to assess diversification rates and to trace the phenotype changes.\n\nWe have found that three of six changes in diversification rates are associated with changes in the endoreplication type and the clades bearing taxa with partial endoreplication showed higher net diversification rates.

The archetypes of the three classes identified to date are ATP synthase, the bacterial flagellar motor, and a proton-driven motor that powers gliding motility and protein secretion in Bacteroidetes bacteria. Whilst the molecular mechanism of ATP synthase is now well understood, structural information is lacking for the other two classes of motor. Here we present the structure of the Bacteroidetes gliding motility motor determined by cryo-electron microscopy. The motor is an asymmetric inner membrane protein complex in which the single transmembrane helices of two periplasm-spanning GldM proteins are positioned within a ring of five GldL proteins. Combining mutagenesis and single-molecule tracking, we identify protonatable amino acid residues within the transmembrane domain of the complex that are important for motor function. Our data imply a mechanism in which proton flow leads the periplasm-spanning GldM dimer to rotate with respect to the intra-membrane GldL ring to drive processes at the bacterial outer membrane. This work provides a molecular basis for understanding how the gliding motility motor is able to transduce the energy of the inner membrane protonmotive force across the bacterial cell envelope.",

    "abstract": "The aggregation of A{beta} is believed to be foundational to the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD). In vitro aggregation kinetics have been shown to correlate with rates of disease progression in both AD patients and animal models, thus proving to be a useful metric for testing A{beta}-targeted therapeutics. Here we present evidence of Cobalt(III) Schiff base complex (Co(III)-sb) modulation of A{beta} aggregation kinetics by a variety of complementary techniques. These include Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Our data was fitted to kinetic rate laws using a mathematical model developed by Knowles et al. in order to extract mechanistic information about the effect of Co(III)-sb on aggregation kinetics. Our analysis revealed that Co(III)-sb significantly decreases the kinetic parameter k+, and significantly increases the polymerization rate kn, suggesting that Co(III)-sb causes A{beta} to rapidly form stable oligomeric species that are unable to elongate into mature fibrils. This result was corroborated by TEM and AFM of A{beta} aggregates in vitro. We also demonstrate that A{beta} aggregate mixtures produced in the presence of Co(III)-sb exhibit decreased cytotoxicity compared to untreated samples.\n\nStatement of SignificanceAmyloid-{beta} is thought to be a key mediator in the pathology of Alzheimers disease, yet its precise mechanisms of toxicity are poorly understood. The interaction of A{beta} with endogenous metal ions via its N terminal Histidine residues has been shown to alter the peptides aggregation and toxicity. As such, metal-based complexes have been developed both as therapeutic agents as well as tools for investigating the role of metal binding in the pathogenesis of AD. This work expands on our previous studies developing Cobalt(III) Schiff base complexes as amyloid inhibitors. Here we demonstrate effective inhibition of aggregation by various complementary modalities. Additionally we show that Co(III)-sb reduces the toxicity of A{beta} aggregates to cells in culture.",

Yet experimental characterization of function remains costly and slow, making computational prediction an important endeavor. In this paper we use a probabilistic evolutionary model built upon phylogenetic trees and experimental Gene Ontology functional annotations that allows automated prediction of function for unannotated genes.\n\nResultsWe have developed a computationally efficient model of evolution of gene annotations using phylogenies based on a Bayesian framework using Markov Chain Monte Carlo for parameter estimation. Unlike previous approaches, our method is able to estimate parameters over many different phylogenetic trees and functions. The resulting parameters agree with biological intuition, such as the increased probability of function change following gene duplication. The method performs well on leave-one-out validation, and we further validated some of the predictions in the experimental scientific literature.\n\nAvailabilityOur method has been implemented as an R package and it is available online at https://github.com/USCBiostats/aphylo. Code needed to reproduce the tables and figures can be found in https://github.com/USCbiostats/aphylo-simulations.\n\nAuthor summaryUnderstanding the individual role that genes play in life is a key issue in biomedical-sciences. While information regarding gene functions is continuously growing, the number of genes with unknown biological purpose is yet greater. Because of this, scientists have dedicated much of their time to build and design tools that automatically infer gene functions. In this paper, we present yet another attempt to do such. While very simple, our model of gene-function evolution has some key features that have the potential to generate an impact in the field: (a) compared to other methods, ours is highly-scalable, which means that it is possible to simultaneously analyze hundreds of what are known as gene-families, compromising thousands of genes, (b) supports our biological intuition as our models data-driven results coherently agree with what theory dictates regarding how gene-functions evolved, (c) notwithstanding its simplicity, the models prediction accuracy is comparable to other more complex alternatives, and (d) perhaps most importantly, it can be used to both support new annotations and to suggest areas in which existing annotations show inconsistencies that may indicate errors or controversies.",

    "abstract": "Studies of the severely pancytopenic scat mouse model first demonstrated the crucial role of RASA3, a dual RAS and RAP GTPase activating protein (GAP), in hematopoiesis. RASA3 is required for survival in utero; germline deletion is lethal at E12.5-13.5 due to severe hemorrhage and decreased fetal liver erythropoiesis. Conditional deletion in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) using Vav-Cre recapitulates the null phenotype demonstrating that RASA3 is required at the stem and progenitor level to maintain blood vessel development and integrity and effective blood production. In adults, bone marrow blood cell production and spleen stress erythropoiesis are suppressed significantly upon induction of RASA3 deficiency, leading to pancytopenia and death within two weeks. Notably, RASA3 missense mutations in mouse models scat (G125V) and hlb381 (H794L) show dramatically different hematopoietic consequences specific to both genetic background and molecular variant. Global transcriptomic studies in scat suggest potential targets to ameliorate disease progression.\n\nAuthor SummaryHematopoiesis is the process by which blood cells are formed. The individual must have a normal complement of red blood cells to prevent anemia, platelets to control bleeding, and white blood cells to maintain immune functions. All blood cells are derived from hematopoietic stem cells that differentiate into progenitor cells that then develop into mature circulating cells. We studied several mouse strains carrying different mutations in RASA3. We show that RASA3 is required at the earliest stages of blood formation, the stem and progenitor cells, and that the complement of genes other than RASA3, or the genetic background of the mutant strain, profoundly alters the overall effect on blood formation. Further, the molecular nature of the mutation in RASA3 also has a profound and independent effect on overall blood formation. One strain, designated scat, suffers cyclic anemia characterized by severe anemic crisis episodes interspersed with remissions where the anemia significantly improves. Comparison of scat crisis and remission hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells reveals striking differences in gene expression. Analyses of these expression differences provide clues to processes that potentially drive improvement of anemia in scat and provide new avenues to pursue in future studies to identify novel therapeutics for anemia.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to study the genetic divergence between genotypes of kale, to propose a methodology for the use of neural networks of the SOM type and to test its efficiency through Andersons discriminant analysis. We evaluated 33 families of half-siblings of kale and three commercial cultivars. The design was a randomized block with four replications with six plants per plot. A total of 14 plant-level quantitative traits were evaluated. Genetic values were predicted at family level via REML / BLUP. For the study of divergence, neural networks of the SOM type (Self-organizing Map) were adopted. We evaluated different network architectures, whose consistencies of the clusters were identified by the Anderson discriminant analysis and by the number of empty clusters. After selecting the best network configuration, a dissimilarity matrix was obtained, from which a dendrogram was constructed using the UPGMA method. The best network architecture was formed with five rows and one column, totaling five neurons and consequently five clusters. The greatest dissimilarity was established between clusters I and V. The crossing between the genotypes of cluster I and those belonging to clusters III and V are the most recommended, since they aim to recombine families with characteristics of interest to the improvement and high dissimilarity. Andersons discriminant analysis showed that the genotype classification was 100% correct, indicating the efficiency of the methodology used.",

    "abstract": "Macrophages serve as a first line of defense against infection with the facultative intracellular pathogen, Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn). However, the ability of these innate phagocytic cells to destroy ingested Cn is strongly influenced by polarization state with classically (M1) activated macrophages better able to control cryptococcal infections than alternatively (M2) activated cells. While earlier studies have demonstrated that intracellular Cn minimally affects the expression of M1 and M2 markers, the impact on the broader transcriptome associated with these states remains unclear. To investigate this, we used an in vitro cell culture model of intracellular infection together with RNA sequencing-based transcriptome profiling to measure the impact of Cn infection on gene expression in both polarization states. The gene expression profile of both M1 and M2 cells was extensively altered to become more like naive (M0) macrophages. Gene ontology analysis suggested that this involved changes in the activity of the Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT), p53, and nuclear factor-{kappa}B (NF-{kappa}B) pathways. Analyses of the principle polarization markers at the protein-level also revealed discrepancies between the RNA- and protein-level responses. In contrast to earlier studies, intracellular Cn was found to increase protein levels of the M1 marker iNos. In addition, we identified common gene expression changes that occurred post-Cn infection, independent of polarization state. This included upregulation of the transcriptional co-regulator Cited1, which was also apparent at the protein level. These changes constitute a transcriptional signature of macrophage Cn infection and provide new insights into how Cn impacts gene expression and the phenotype of host phagocytes.",

    "abstract": "Molecular markers derived from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) represent an accessible means of exploring the pathobiology of Huntingtons disease (HD) in vivo. The endo-lysosomal/autophagy system is dysfunctional in HD, potentially contributing to disease pathogenesis and representing a potential target for therapeutic intervention. Several endo-lysosomal proteins have shown promise as biomarkers in other neurodegenerative diseases; however, they have yet to be fully explored in HD. We performed parallel reaction monitoring mass spectrometry analysis (PRM-MS) of multiple endo-lysosomal proteins in the CSF of 60 HD mutation carriers and 20 healthy controls. Using generalised linear models controlling for age and CAG, none of the 18 proteins measured displayed significant differences in concentration between HD patients and controls. This was affirmed by principal component analysis, in which no significant difference across disease stage was found in any of the three components representing lysosomal hydrolases, binding/transfer proteins and innate immune system/peripheral proteins. However, several proteins were associated with measures of disease severity and cognition: most notably amyloid precursor protein, which displayed strong correlations with composite Unified Huntingtons Disease Rating Scale, UHDRS Total Functional Capacity, UHDRS Total Motor Score, Symbol Digit Modalities Test and Stroop Word Reading. We conclude that although endo-lysosomal proteins are unlikely to have value as disease state CSF biomarkers for Huntingtons disease, several proteins demonstrate associations with clinical severity, thus warranting further, targeted exploration and validation in larger, longitudinal samples.",

    "abstract": "This paper is about the use of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to assist in the statistical analysis of a network of a few hundred integrate-and-fire neurons intended to model local circuits in the cerebral cortex. Using training data produced by direct numerical simulations, our first task was to discover, with the aid of a DNN, the mapping that yields model response for each set of parameters and input values. After evaluating the performance of the DNN surrogate both in the accuracy of its outputs and in its performance in parameter tuning, we analyzed the outputs of the well-trained DNN to gain insight into local circuits as basic cortical computational units. Because the DNN surrogate computed with vastly higher speeds than actual simulations of the neuronal network, we were able to sample large sets of parameters and input values to produce a broad statistical picture of input-output relations. One of the aims of this paper is to demonstrate that statistical analyses of this kind can provide general theoretical information on model behavior as well as suggest cortical mechanisms. Among our results are the following: Through a derivative analysis of model responses we identified a certain dichotomy in the behavior of I-neurons, leading to a characterization of high gain states which in turn offered insight into mechanisms for surround suppression. A second-derivative analysis revealed limitations of models of integrate-and-fire neurons, namely their inability to replicate the nonlinearities in gain curves observed in real neurons.\n\nAuthor summaryLocal circuits are basic computational units of the cerebral cortex, and statistical analysis of detailed models of such circuits will shed light on cortical computation. Because analytical tools are either overly simplistic or not applicable, systematic numerical exploration of high-dimensional parameter space is not feasible and simulation-based arguments are seldom more than heuristic, we propose in this paper a data-driven DNN-assisted approach that falls into the general framework of surrogate-based modeling. We consider as a test case a network of integrate-and-fire neurons intended to model local circuits in cortex. With the help of an accurate yet extremely efficient DNN surrogate, we reveal the statistics of model response, providing a detailed picture of model behavior. The information obtained is both general and of a fundamental nature, with direct application to neuroscience. Our results suggest that the methodology proposed can be scaled up to larger and more complex neuronal models.",

    "abstract": "The main ingredient of sunless tanning products is dihydroxyacetone (DHA). DHA reacts with the protein and amino acid composition in the surface layers of the skin, producing melanoidins, which changes the skin colour, imitating natural skin tan caused by melanin. The purpose of this study was to characterise DHA-induced skin colour changes and to test whether we can predict the outcome of DHA application on skin tone changes.\n\nTo assess the DHA-induced skin colour shift quantitatively, colorimetric and spectral measurements of the inner forearm were obtained before, four hours and 24 hours after application of a 7.5% concentration DHA gel in the experimental group (n = 100). In a control group (n = 60), the same measurements were obtained on both the inner forearm (infrequently sun-exposed) and the outer forearm (frequently sun-exposed); the difference between these two areas was defined as the naturally occurring tan. Skin colour shifts caused by DHA tanning and by natural tanning were compared in terms of lightness (L*), redness (a*) and yellowness (b*) in the standard CIELAB colour space. Naturalness of the DHA-induced skin tan was evaluated by comparing the trajectory of the chromaticity distribution in (L*, b*) space with that of naturally occurring tan. Twenty-four hours after DHA application, approximately 20% of the skin colour samples became excessively yellow, with chromaticities outside the natural range in (L*, b*) space. A principal component analysis was used to characterise the tanning pathway. Skin colour shifts induced by DHA were predicted by a multiple regression on the chromaticities and the skin properties. The model explained up to 49% of variance in colorimetric components with a median error of less than 2 {Delta}E. We conclude that the control of both the magnitude and the direction of the colour shift is a critical factor to achieve a natural appearance.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDThere is a widely reported preponderance of major limb loss in Northern Uganda, which is believed to have been caused in large part by prolonged civil war. Access to rehabilitation facilities is extremely limited, and there has never been a study to understand how many people have major limb loss, nor how many of them have had access to medical or rehabilitative services.\n\nAIMThe first prevalence study of disability and major limb loss in the region, and evaluated spatial patterns of cases of MLL.\n\nDESIGNCross-sectional survey.\n\nSETTINGThis research was undertaken in a community setting (at subjects homes).\n\nPOPULATION7,864 randomly selected households throughout the Acholi Sub-Region of Northern Uganda.\n\nMETHODSThis study comprised two questionnaires, the first to be completed by the head of every sampled household (n=7,864), and the second by any member of the household with major limb loss (n=181). Household locations were examined for spatial autocorrelation using Morans I statistic. The {chi}2 goodness of fit statistic was used to profile those with major limb loss in comparison with the underlying population.\n\nRESULTSWe conservatively estimate that there are c.10,117 people with major limb loss in the region who require long-term rehabilitation services (c.0.5% of the population), and c.150,512 people with disabilities other than MLL (c.8.2% of the population). People with major limb loss are spread throughout the region (as opposed to clustered in specific locations) and are disproportionately male, older and less well educated than the general population.\n\nCONCLUSIONThis research demonstrates, for the first time, the extent of the inadequacy of long-term rehabilitation services for those with major limb-loss in the study area. We provide new insight into the reasons that people are not accessing medical and rehabilitative services, and propose a way forward through the successful demonstration of an  outreach clinic model.\n\nCLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACTThe discovery of the spatial pattern of those with major limb loss, alongside the demonstration of the clinical outreach model, provides a compelling argument for the need of more such services and associated policy frameworks in remote and rural regions in the Global South.\n\nTIDIER ChecklistWe confirm that this manuscript conforms to the STROBE Checklist for Cross-Sectional Studies",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOne of the most common medical problems associated with pregnancy is hypertension. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), which has been attributable to abnormal placentation may have adverse effects on both mother and foetus if left unchecked. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy (HDP), the morphological variations of human placenta in HDP, and maternal and perinatal outcomes in HDP.\n\nMaterials and MethodsThis was a prospective case-control study, conducted at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH), Ghana. The progression of pregnancy in normotensive and hypertensive pregnant women, and the eventual perinatal outcomes were closely followed. Statistical analysis was performed using IMB-SPSS version 23. Associations were considered significant at p values of [&le;] 0.05.\n\nResultsFrom a total of 214 deliveries recorded during the period of study, 84 (39.25%) were hypertensives. Forty four (52%) of the hypertensives had preeclampsia, 28 (33.3%) had gestational hypertension, 6 (7.1%) had eclampsia, 4 (4.8%) had chronic hypertension, and 2 (2.4%) had preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension. The frequency of placental haematoma, placental infarction, and placental calcification in the normotensives were significantly (p=0.001) lower than that of the hypertensives. The mean placental weight (p = 0.01), placental volume (p = 0.001), placental diameter (p = 0.03), and placental thickness (p = 0.001) of the normotensives were significantly higher than those of the hypertensives. The number of normotensives in whom labour was induced, who had their babies delivered by caesarean section, and who were admitted after they had given birth were significantly (p=0.001) lower than that of hypertensives who underwent similar procedures. No stillbirths were recorded in the normotensives compared with four in the hypertensives. The number of babies delivered to the normotensives who were admitted to the NICU was significantly (p=0.001) lower than those delivered by hypertensives.\n\nConclusionThere was a high prevalence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in the study site. The condition adversely affected placental development and perinatal outcomes. These adverse effects can be curtailed by embarking on a vigorous health education drive.",

    "abstract": "Quinoa depicts high nutritional quality and abiotic stress resistance attracting strong interest in the last years. To unravel the function of candidate genes for agronomically relevant traits, studying their transcriptional activities by RT-qPCR is an important experimental approach. The accuracy of such experiments strongly depends on precise data normalization. To date, validation of potential candidate genes for normalization of diurnal expression studies has not been performed in C. quinoa. We selected eight candidate genes based on transcriptome data and literature survey, including conventionally used reference genes. We used three statistical algorithms (BestKeeper, geNorm and NormFinder) to test their stability and added further validation by a simulation-based strategy. We demonstrated that using different reference genes, including those top ranked by stability, causes significant differences among the resulting diurnal expression patterns, and that our novel approach overcomes failures related to stability-based selection of reference genes. Our results show that isocitrate dehydrogenase enzyme (IDH-A) and polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) are suitable genes to normalize diurnal expression data of two different quinoa accessions. The validated reference genes obtained in this study will improve the accuracy of RT-qPCR data normalization and facilitate gene expression studies in quinoa.",

    "abstract": "Since the initial report of glyphosate-resistant (GR) Amaranthus palmeri (S) Wats. in 2006, resistant populations have been reported in 28 states. The mechanism of resistance is amplification of a 399-kb extrachromosomal circular DNA, called the EPSPS replicon, and is unique to glyphosate-resistant plants. The replicon contains a single copy of the 10-kb 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) gene which causes the concomitant increased expression of EPSP synthase, the target enzyme of glyphosate. It is not known whether the resistance by this amplification mechanism evolved once and then spread across the country or evolved independently in several locations. To compare genomic representation and variation across the EPSPS replicon, whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGS) and mapping of sequences from both GR and susceptible (GS) biotypes to the replicon consensus sequence was performed. Sampling of GR biotypes from AZ, KS, GA, MD and DE and GS biotypes from AZ, KS and GA revealed complete contiguity and deep representation with sequences from GR plants, but lack of homogeneity and contiguity with breaks in coverage were observed with sequences from GS biotypes. The high sequence conservation among GR biotypes with very few polymorphisms which were widely distributed across the USA further supports the hypothesis that glyphosate resistance most likely originated from a single population. We show that the replicon from different populations was unique to GR plants and had similar levels of amplification.",

    "abstract": "Identification of biologically relevant motifs in proteins is a long-standing problem in bioinformatics, especially when considering distantly related proteins where sequence analysis alone becomes increasingly difficult. Here we present a novel approach to identify such motifs in protein three-dimensional structures without depending on sequence alignment by representing structures as graphs in the form of residue interaction networks and employing a modified frequent subgraph mining algorithm. These networks represent residues as vertices while contacts between residues are denoted by edges labeled with Euclidean distances. We use frequent subgraph mining to determine all subgraphs that are subgraph isomorphic to, i.e. are contained in, at least a given number of such networks generated from structures in the same protein family. For this we introduce two extensions of the classical frequent subgraph mining: approximate matching of distance-based labels to account for small variations between protein structures and scoring as well as score-based filtering of subgraphs in order to identify structurally conserved motifs and to counteract the expanding size of the search space. This approach was then validated by demonstrating that it can rediscover previously characterized functionally important structural motifs in selected protein families. For further validation we show that it is also able to identify motifs that correspond to patterns in the PROSITE database. We then applied our approach to all superfamilies in the SCOP database and found an enrichment of residues in the ligand binding site in the discovered motifs evidencing their functional importance. Finally we use the approach to discover a novel structural motif in jelly-roll capsid proteins found in members of the picornavirus-like superfamily. This is presented together with an efficient open source implementation of the algorithm called RINminer.\n\nAuthor summaryAs the evolutionary distance between proteins increases, their sequence identity drops rapidly, whereas functionally important sequence motifs and three-dimensional (3D) structural scaffold, in which they are embedded, are more conserved. We developed an approach that automatically identifies such motifs by converting protein 3D structures into a set of graphs and then employing the frequent subgraph mining framework. In these graphs, residues are represented as vertices, and if two residues interact in the corresponding protein 3D structure, they are connected by an edge labeled with the Euclidean distance between the residues. In the classical setting of frequent subgraph mining, all subgraphs from a database of graphs are enumerated and the ones that are exactly found, i.e. are subgraph isomorphic, in more than a certain number of graphs are listed as supported. Our approach introduces two new concepts: approximately isomorphic subgraphs and an efficient scoring scheme that allows to retain only biologically relevant subgraph in the enumeration step. Approximate isomorphism allows edge labels not to match exactly, and thus account for natural deviations between 3D structures of related proteins. With our approach, we were able to automatically rediscover known motifs from PROSITE, as well as in three well-studied extremely diverse protein families. We predicted functionally important residues in SCOP superfamilies and demonstrated that they tend to lie in structurally meaningful regions: ligand-binding sites and protein core. Additionally, we present a previously unreported structural motif in jelly-roll viral capsids.",

    "abstract": "Lignin is the second most abundant carbon polymer on earth and despite having more fuel value than cellulose, it currently is considered a waste byproduct in many industrial lignocellulose applications. Valorization of lignin relies on effective and green methods of delignification, with a growing interest in the use of microbes. Here we investigate the physiology and lignin biotransformation mechanisms of the novel facultative anaerobic bacterium, Tolumonas lignolytica BRL6-1, under anoxic conditions. Physiological and biochemical changes were compared between cells grown anaerobically in either lignin-amended or unamended conditions. In the presence of lignin, BRL6-1 had a higher biomass and shorter lag phase compared to unamended conditions, and 14% of the proteins determined to be significantly higher in abundance by log2 fold-change of 2 or greater were related to Fe(II) transport in early exponential phase. Ferrozine assays of the supernatant (<10 kDa fraction) confirmed that Fe(III) was bound to lignin and reduced to Fe(II) only in the presence of BRL6-1, suggesting redox activity by the cells. LC-MS/MS analysis of the secretome showed an extra band at 20 kDa in lignin-amended conditions. Protein sequencing of this band identified a protein of unknown function with homology to enzymes in the radical SAM superfamily. Expression of this protein in lignin-amended conditions suggests its role in radical formation. From our findings, we suggest that BRL6-1 is using a protein in the radical SAM superfamily to interact with the Fe(III) bound to lignin and reducing it to Fe(II) for cellular use, increasing BRL6-1 yield under lignin-amended conditions. This interaction potentially generates organic free radicals and causes a radical cascade which could modify and depolymerize lignin. Further research should clarify the extent to which this mechanism is similar to previously described aerobic chelator-mediated Fenton chemistry or radical producing lignolytic enzymes, such as lignin peroxidases, but under anoxic conditions.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTThe novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has evolved into a worldwide pandemic. Early data suggest that the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 appear to be higher among patients with underlying cardiovascular risk factors. Despite the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection, in cardiomyocytes, there has been no conclusive evidence of direct viral infection although the presence of inflammation and viral genome within the hearts of COVID-19 patients have been reported. Here we transduced A549 lung epithelial cells with lentivirus overexpressing selected genes of the SARS-CoV-2. We then isolated extracellular vesicles (EVs) from the supernatant of A549 cells and detected the presence of viral RNA within the purified EVs. Importantly, we observed that human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) were able to actively uptake these EVs and viral genes were subsequently detected in the cardiomyocytes. Accordingly, uptake of EVs containing viral genes led to an upregulation of inflammation-related genes in hiPSC-CMs. Thus, our findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 RNA-containing EVs represent an indirect route of viral RNA entry into cardiomyocytes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing an exponentially increasing number of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) cases globally. Prioritization of medical countermeasures for evaluation in randomized clinical trials is critically hindered by the lack of COVID-19 animal models that enable accurate, quantifiable, and reproducible measurement of COVID-19 pulmonary disease free from observer bias. We first used serial computed tomography (CT) to demonstrate that bilateral intrabronchial instillation of SARS-CoV-2 into crab-eating macaques (Macaca fascicularis) results in mild-to-moderate lung abnormalities qualitatively characteristic of subclinical or mild-to-moderate COVID-19 (e.g., ground-glass opacities with or without reticulation, paving, or alveolar consolidation, peri-bronchial thickening, linear opacities) at typical locations (peripheral>central, posterior and dependent, bilateral, multi-lobar). We then used positron emission tomography (PET) analysis to demonstrate increased FDG uptake in the CT-defined lung abnormalities and regional lymph nodes. PET/CT imaging findings appeared in all macaques as early as 2 days post-exposure, variably progressed, and subsequently resolved by 6-12 days post-exposure. Finally, we applied operator-independent, semi-automatic quantification of the volume and radiodensity of CT abnormalities as a possible primary endpoint for immediate and objective efficacy testing of candidate medical countermeasures.",

    "abstract": "Among 15 nonstructural proteins (Nsps), the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 encodes a large, multidomain Nsp3. One of its units is ADP-ribose phosphatase domain (ADRP, also known as macrodomain) which is believed to interfere with the host immune response. Such a function appears to be linked to the proteins ability to remove ADP-ribose from ADP-ribosylated proteins and RNA, yet the precise role and molecular targets of the enzyme remains unknown. Here, we have determined five, high resolution (1.07 - 2.01 [A]) crystal structures corresponding to the apo form of the protein and complexes with 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), AMP and ADPr. We show that the protein undergoes conformational changes to adapt to the ligand in a manner previously observed before for in close homologs from other viruses. We also identify a conserved water molecule that may participate in hydrolysis. This work builds foundations for future structure-based research of the ADRP, including search for potential antiviral therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019 and since evolved into a global threat with nearly 4.4 million infected people and over 290,000 confirmed deaths worldwide.1 SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus presenting spike (S) glycoproteins on its outer surface. Binding of S to host cell angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is thought to be critical for cellular entry. The host range of the virus extends far beyond humans and non-human primates. Natural and experimental infections have confirmed high susceptibility of cats, ferrets, and hamsters, whereas dogs, mice, rats, pigs, and chickens seem refractory to SARS-CoV-2 infection. To investigate the reason for the variable susceptibility observed in different species, we have developed molecular descriptors to efficiently analyze our dynamic simulation models of complexes between SARS-CoV-2 S and ACE2. Based on our analyses we predict that: (i) the red squirrel is likely susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and (ii) specific mutations in ACE2 of dogs, rats, and mice render them susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "Once delayed non-invasive remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) has been proven to provide endogenous protection against injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion in the central nervous system. However, for thus ischemic preconditioning method, it is still unclear how long this protection can maintain and what the underlying mechanism is. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that once delayed non-invasive RIPC protects brain injury at short reperfusion time. The rat was stimulated by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) for 90 min, and subsequent reperfusion was performed at 6 h, 72 h and 7 days after MCAo. RIPC was conducted in both hind limbs 24 h before MCAo for 3 cycles (10 min ischemia/ 10 min reperfusion). The infarct size was measured by 2, 3, 5-triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and Cresyl violet (CV) staining. The mRNA and protein levels of inflammatory cytokines in the brain were measured by real-time RT-PCR and ELISA. The results showed that once delayed non-invasive RIPC reduced the infarct size, improved neurological functions and behavioral performance at 6 and 72 h post-stroke. There was no change by reperfusion at 7 d after MCAo. RIPC reduced the levels of TNF, IL-1{beta} and IL-6 in the brain at 72 h post stroke. It also reduced the levels of TNF and IL-1{beta} when reperfusion at 6 h after MCAo. Our results strongly supported that once delayed non-invasive RIPC protects against stroke as a non-invasive neuroprotective strategy, which maintained for both short and middle term ischemic reperfusion time. The protective effect is mediated by the modulation of inflammatory response in the ischemic brain.",
