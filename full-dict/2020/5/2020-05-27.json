    "abstract": "The genomic revolution offers renewed hope of resolving rapid radiations in the Tree of Life. The development of the multispecies coalescent (MSC) model and improved gene tree estimation methods can better accommodate gene tree heterogeneity caused by incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and gene tree estimation error stemming from the short internal branches. However, the relative influence of these factors in species tree inference is not well understood. Using anchored hybrid enrichment, we generated a data set including 423 single-copy loci from 64 taxa representing 39 families to infer the species tree of the flowering plant order Malpighiales. This order alone includes nine of the top ten most unstable nodes in angiosperms, and the recalcitrant relationships along the backbone of the order have been hypothesized to arise from the rapid radiation during the Cretaceous. Here, we show that coalescent-based methods do not resolve the backbone of Malpighiales and concatenation methods yield inconsistent estimations, providing evidence that gene tree heterogeneity is high in this clade. Despite high levels of ILS and gene tree estimation error, our simulations demonstrate that these two factors alone are insufficient to explain the lack of resolution in this order. To explore this further, we examined triplet frequencies among empirical gene trees and discovered some of them deviated significantly from those attributed to ILS and estimation error, suggesting gene flow as an additional and previously unappreciated phenomenon promoting gene tree variation in Malpighiales. Finally, we applied a novel method to quantify the relative contribution of these three primary sources of gene tree heterogeneity and demonstrated that ILS, gene tree estimation error, and gene flow contributed to 15%, 52%, and 32% of the variation, respectively. Together, our results suggest that a perfect storm of factors likely influence this lack of resolution, and further indicate that recalcitrant phylogenetic relationships like the backbone of Malpighiales may be better represented as phylogenetic networks. Thus, reducing such groups solely to existing models that adhere strictly to bifurcating trees greatly oversimplifies reality, and obscures our ability to more clearly discern the process of evolution.",

    "abstract": "Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) can be differentiated into adipocytes and osteoblasts. While the transcriptomic and epigenomic changes during adipogenesis and osteogenesis have been characterized, what happens to the chromatin loops is hardly known. Here we induced hMSCs to adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation, and performed 2 kb resolution Hi-C experiments for loop detection and generated RNA-seq, histone modification ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data for integrative analysis before and after differentiation. We quantitatively identified differential contact loops and unique loops. After integrating with multi-omics data, we demonstrate that strengthened loops after differentiation are associated with gene expression activation. Specially, unique loops are linked with cell fate determination. We also proposed loop-mediated regulatory networks and identified IRS2 and RUNX2 as being activated by cell-specific loops to facilitate adipocytes and osteoblasts commitment, respectively. These results are expected to help better understand the long-range regulation in controlling hMSC differentiation, and provide novel targets for studying adipocytes and osteoblasts determination.",

    "abstract": "Macadamia integrifolia is a representative of the large basal eudicot family Proteaceae and the main progenitor species of the Australian native nut crop macadamia. Since its commercialisation in Hawaii fewer than 100 years ago, global production has expanded rapidly. However, genomic resources are limited in comparison to other horticultural crops. The first draft assembly of M. integrifolia had good coverage of the functional gene space but its high fragmentation has restricted its use in comparative genomics and association studies. Here we have generated an improved assembly of cultivar HAES 741 (4,094 scaffolds, 745 Mb, N50 413 kb) using a combination of Illumina paired and PacBio long read sequences. Scaffolds were anchored to 14 pseudo-chromosomes using seven genetic linkage maps. This assembly has improved contiguity and coverage, with >120 Gb of additional sequence. Following annotation, 34,274 protein-coding genes were predicted, representing 92% of the expected gene content. Our results indicate that the macadamia genome is repetitive and heterozygous. The total repeat content was 55% and genome-wide heterozygosity, estimated by read mapping, was 0.98% or one SNP per 102 bp. This is the first chromosome-scale genome assembly for macadamia and the Proteaceae. It is expected to be a valuable resource for breeding, gene discovery, conservation and evolutionary genomics.",

    "abstract": "Virus-like DNA nanoparticles have emerged as promising vaccine and gene delivery platforms due to their programmable nature that offers independent control over size, shape, and functionalization. However, as biodegradable materials, their utility for specific therapeutic indications depends on their structural integrity during biodistribution to efficiently target cells, tissues, or organs. Here, we explore reversible minor groove binders to control the degradation half-lives of wireframe DNA origami. Bare, two-helix DNA nanoparticles were found to be stable under typical cell culture conditions in presence of bovine serum, yet they remain susceptible to endonucleases, specifically DNAse I. Moreover, they degrade rapidly in mouse serum, suggesting species-specific degradation. Blocking minor groove accessibility with diamidines resulted in substantial protection against endonucleases, specifically DNAse-I. This strategy was found to be compatible with both varying wireframe DNA origami architectures and functionalization with protein antigens. Our stabilization strategy offers distinct physicochemical properties compared with established cationic polymer-based methods, with synergistic therapeutic potential for minor groove binder delivery for infectious diseases and cancer.",

    "abstract": "We address the problem of generating novel molecules with desired interaction properties as a multi-objective optimization problem. Interaction binding models are learned from binding data using graph convolution networks (GCNs). Since the experimentally obtained property scores are recognised as having potentially gross errors, we adopted a robust loss for the model. Combinations of these terms, including drug likeness and synthetic accessibility, are then optimized using reinforcement learning based on a graph convolution policy approach. Some of the molecules generated, while legitimate chemically, can have excellent drug-likeness scores but appear unusual. We provide an example based on the binding potency of small molecules to dopamine transporters. We extend our method successfully to use a multi-objective reward function, in this case for generating novel molecules that bind with dopamine transporters but not with those for norepinephrine. Our method should be generally applicable to the generation in silico of molecules with desirable properties.",

Despite ample theoretical research on neural competition, experimental tools to allow neurophysiological investigation of competing neurons have not been available. We developed a \"hybrid\" system where real-life neurons and a computer-simulated neural circuit interacted. It enabled us to construct a mutual inhibition circuit between two real life pyramidal neurons. We then asked what dynamics this minimal unit of neural competition exhibits and compared them to the known behavioral-level dynamics of neural competition. We found that the pair of neurons shows bi-stability when activated simultaneously by current injections. The addition of modelled noise and changes in the activation strength showed that the dynamics of the circuit are strikingly similar to the known properties of bi-stable visual perception.",

Recently, copper fungicides and antibiotics are major strategies for controlling bacterial diseases. However, resistant strains have already been found. Therefore, there is an increasing demand for sustainable new disease control strategies. We investigated the ASM disease control effect against Pseudomonas cannabina pv. alisalensis (Pcal), which causes bacterial blight on Japanese radish. In this study, we demonstrated that ASM effectively suppressed Pcal disease symptom development associated with reduced bacterial populations on Japanese radish leaves. Interestingly, we also demonstrated that ASM activated systemic acquired resistance (SAR), including stomatal-based defense, not only on ASM treated leaves, but also on untreated upper and lower leaves. Reactive oxidative species (ROS) are essential second messengers in stomatal-based defense. We found that ASM induced stomatal closure by inducing ROS production through peroxidase. These results indicate that stomatal closure induced by ASM treatment is effective for preventing Pcal pathogen invasion into plants, and in turn reduction of disease development.",

    "abstract": "Dioecy, the separation of reproductive organs on different individuals, has evolved repeatedly in different plant families. Several evolutionary paths to dioecy have been suggested, but the mechanisms behind sex determination is not well understood. The diploid dioecious Amaranthus palmeri represents a well suited model system to study sex determination in plants. A. palmeri is one of the most troublesome weeds in the US, has successfully colonized other regions in the world and has evolved resistance to several herbicide classes. Despite the agricultural importance of the species, the genetic control and evolutionary state of dioecy in A. palmeri is currently unknown. Early cytogenetic experiments did not identify heteromorphic chromosomes. Here, we used whole genome sequencing of male and female pools from two independent populations to elucidate the genetic control of dioecy in A. palmeri. Read alignment to a close monoecious relative and allele frequency comparisons between male and female pools did not reveal significant sex linked genes. Consequently, we employed an alignment free k-mer comparison which enabled us to identify a large number of male specific k-mers. We assembled male specific contigs comprising a total of almost 2 Mb sequence, proposing a XY sex determination system in the species. Based on our findings we suggest an intermediate evolutionary state of dioecy in A. palmeri. Our findings give insight into the evolution of sex chromosomes in plants and may help to develop sustainable strategies for weed management.",

    "abstract": "As the Watson-Crick faces of nucleobases are protected in double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), it is commonly assumed that deleterious alkylation damage to the Watson-Crick faces of nucleobases predominantly occurs when DNA becomes single-stranded during replication and transcription. However, damage to the Watson-Crick faces of nucleobases has been reported in dsDNA in vitro through mechanisms that are not understood. In addition, the extent of protection from methylation damage conferred by dsDNA relative to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) has not been quantified. Watson-Crick base-pairs in dsDNA exist in dynamic equilibrium with Hoogsteen base-pairs that expose the Watson-Crick faces of purine nucleobases to solvent. Whether this can influence the damage susceptibility of dsDNA remains unknown. Using dot-blot and primer extension assays, we measured the susceptibility of adenine-N1 to methylation by dimethyl sulfate (DMS) when in an A-T Watson-Crick versus Hoogsteen conformation. Relative to unpaired adenines in a bulge, Watson-Crick A-T base-pairs in dsDNA only conferred ~130-fold protection against adenine-N1 methylation and this protection was reduced to ~40-fold for A(syn)-T Hoogsteen base-pairs embedded in a DNA-drug complex. Our results indicate that Watson-Crick faces of nucleobases are accessible to alkylating agents in canonical dsDNA and that Hoogsteen base-pairs increase this accessibility. Given the higher abundance of dsDNA relative to ssDNA, these results suggest that dsDNA could be a substantial source of cytotoxic damage. The work establishes DMS probing as a method for characterizing A(syn)-T Hoogsteen base pairs in vitro and also lays the foundation for a sequencing approach to map A(syn)-T Hoogsteen and unpaired adenines genome-wide in vivo.",

We generated ~ 1,000 doubled-haploid (DH) lines from three European maize landraces, pre-selected based on molecular and phenotypic information. Using GWAS, we mapped haplotype-trait associations for early development traits at high resolution in eleven environments. Molecular haplotype inventories of landrace derived DH libraries and a broad panel of 65 breeding lines based on 501,124 SNPs revealed novel variation for target traits in the landraces. DH lines carrying these novel haplotypes outperformed breeding lines not carrying the respective haplotypes. Most haplotypes associated with target traits showed stable effects across populations and environments and only limited correlated effects with undesired traits making them ideal for introgression into elite germplasm. Our strategy was successful in linking molecular variation to meaningful phenotypes and identifying novel variation for quantitative traits in plant genetic resources.",

    "abstract": "The 3q29 deletion (3q29Del) confers >40-fold increased risk for schizophrenia. However, no single gene in this interval is definitively associated with disease, prompting the hypothesis that neuropsychiatric sequelae emerge upon loss of multiple functionally-connected genes. 3q29 genes are unevenly annotated and the impact of 3q29Del on the human neural transcriptome is unknown. To systematically formulate unbiased hypotheses about molecular mechanisms linking 3q29Del to neuropsychiatric illness, we conducted a systems-level network analysis of the non-pathological adult human cortical transcriptome and generated evidence-based predictions that relate 3q29 genes to novel functions and disease associations. The 21 protein-coding genes located in the interval segregated into seven clusters of highly co-expressed genes, demonstrating both convergent and distributed effects of 3q29Del across the interrogated transcriptomic landscape. Pathway analysis of these clusters indicated involvement in nervous-system functions, including synaptic signaling and organization, as well as core cellular functions, including transcriptional regulation, post-translational modifications, chromatin remodeling and mitochondrial metabolism. Top network-neighbors of 3q29 genes showed significant overlap with known schizophrenia, autism and intellectual disability-risk genes, suggesting that 3q29Del biology is relevant to idiopathic disease. Leveraging \"guilt by association\", we propose nine 3q29 genes, including one hub gene, as prioritized drivers of neuropsychiatric risk. These results provide testable hypotheses for experimental analysis on causal drivers and mechanisms of the largest known genetic risk factor for schizophrenia and highlight the study of normal function in non-pathological post-mortem tissue to further our understanding of psychiatric genetics, especially for rare syndromes like 3q29Del, where access to neural tissue from carriers is unavailable or limited.",

One of the most common analyses of scRNA-seq data detects distinct subpopulations of cells through the use of unsupervised clustering algorithms. However, recent advances in scRNA-seq technologies result in current datasets ranging from thousands to millions of cells. Popular clustering algorithms, such as k-means, typically require the data to be loaded entirely into memory and therefore can be slow or impossible to run with large datasets. To address this problem, we developed the mbkmeans R/Bioconductor package, an open-source implementation of the mini-batch k-means algorithm. Our package allows for on-disk data representations, such as the common HDF5 file format widely used for single-cell data, that do not require all the data to be loaded into memory at one time. We demonstrate the performance of the mbkmeans package using large datasets, including one with 1.3 million cells. We also highlight and compare the computing performance of mbkmeans against the standard implementation of k - means. Our software package is available in Bioconductor at https://bioconductor.org/packages/mbkmeans.",

    "abstract": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) has caused over 5,000,000 cases of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with significant fatality rate.1-3 Due to the urgency of this global pandemic, numerous therapeutic and vaccine trials have begun without customary safety and efficacy studies.4 Laboratory mice have been the stalwart of these types of studies; however, they do not support infection by SARS-CoV-2 due to the inability of its spike (S) protein to engage the mouse ortholog of its human entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). While hACE2 transgenic mice support infection and pathogenesis,5 these mice are currently limited in availability and are restricted to a single genetic background. Here we report the development of a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 based on adeno associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression of hACE2. These mice support viral replication and antibody production and exhibit pathologic findings found in COVID-19 patients as well as non-human primate models. Moreover, we show that type I interferons are unable to control SARS-CoV2 replication and drive pathologic responses. Thus, the hACE2-AAV mouse model enables rapid deployment for in-depth analysis following robust SARS-CoV-2 infection with authentic patient-derived virus in mice of diverse genetic backgrounds. This represents a much-needed platform for rapidly testing prophylactic and therapeutic strategies to combat COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "We here describe the development and validation of IMMUNO-COV, a high-throughput clinical test to quantitatively measure SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies, the specific subset of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies that block viral infection. The test measures the capacity of serum or purified antibodies to neutralize a recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. This recombinant virus (VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-{Delta}19CT) induces fusion in Vero cell monolayers, which is detected as luciferase signal using a dual split protein (DSP) reporter system. VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-{Delta}19CT infection was blocked by monoclonal -SARS-CoV-2-spike antibodies and by plasma or serum from SARS-CoV-2 convalescing individuals. The assay exhibited 100% specificity in validation tests, and across all tests zero false positives were detected. In blinded analyses of 230 serum samples, only two unexpected results were observed based on available clinical data. We observed a perfect correlation between results from our assay and 80 samples that were also assayed using a commercially available ELISA. To quantify the magnitude of the anti-viral response, we generated a calibration curve by adding stepped concentrations of -SARS-CoV-2-spike monoclonal antibody to pooled SARS-CoV-2 seronegative serum. Using the calibration curve and a single optimal 1:100 serum test dilution, we reliably measured neutralizing antibody levels in each test sample. Virus neutralization units (VNUs) calculated from the assay correlated closely (p < 0.0001) with PRNTEC50 values determined by plaque reduction neutralization test against a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the IMMUNO-COV assay accurately quantitates SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in human sera and therefore is a potentially valuable addition to the currently available serological tests. The assay can provide vital information for comparing immune responses to the various SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that are currently in development, or for evaluating donor eligibility in convalescent plasma therapy studies.",

    "abstract": "Diseases imply dysregulation of cells functions at several levels. The study of differentially expressed genes in case-control cohorts of patients is often the first step in understanding the details of the cells dysregulation. A further level of analysis is introduced by noticing that genes are organized in functional modules (often called pathways), thus their action and their dysregulation may be better understood by the identification of the modules most affected by the disease (aka disease modules, or active subnetworks). We describe how an algorithm based on the Core&Peel method developed originally for detecting protein complexes in PPI networks, can be adapted to detect disease modules in co-expression networks of genes. We first validate Core&Peel for the easier general task of functional module detection by comparison with 42 methods participating in the Disease Module Identification DREAM challenge of 2019. Next, we use four specific disease test cases (colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, asthma and rheumatoid arthritis), four state-of-the-art algorithms (ModuleDiscoverer, Degas, KeyPathwayMiner and ClustEx), and several pathway databases to validate the proposed algorithm. Core&Peel is the only method able to find significant associations of the predicted disease module with known validated relevant pathways for all four diseases. Moreover for the two cancer data sets, Core&Peel detects further nine relevant pathways enriched in the predicted disease module, not discovered by the other methods used in the comparative analysis. Finally we apply Core&Peel, along with other methods, to explore the transcriptional response of human cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection, at a modular level, aiming at finding supporting evidence for drug repositioning efforts.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, lacks effective therapeutics. Additionally, no antiviral drugs or vaccines were developed against the closely related coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV, despite previous zoonotic outbreaks. To identify starting points for such therapeutics, we performed a large-scale screen of electrophile and non-covalent fragments through a combined mass spectrometry and X-ray approach against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, one of two cysteine viral proteases essential for viral replication. Our crystallographic screen identified 71 hits that span the entire active site, as well as 3 hits at the dimer interface. These structures reveal routes to rapidly develop more potent inhibitors through merging of covalent and non-covalent fragment hits; one series of low-reactivity, tractable covalent fragments was progressed to discover improved binders. These combined hits offer unprecedented structural and reactivity information for on-going structure-based drug design against SARS-CoV-2 main protease.",

    "abstract": "The global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the associated disease COVID-19, requires therapeutic interventions that can be rapidly identified and translated to clinical care. Traditional drug discovery methods have a >90% failure rate and can take 10-15 years from target identification to clinical use. In contrast, drug repurposing can significantly accelerate translation. We developed a quantitative high-throughput screen to identify efficacious agents against SARS-CoV-2. From a library of 1,425 FDA-approved compounds and clinical candidates, we identified 17 dose-responsive compounds with in vitro antiviral efficacy in human liver Huh7 cells and confirmed antiviral efficacy in human colon carcinoma Caco-2, human prostate adenocarcinoma LNCaP, and in a physiologic relevant model of alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (iAEC2s). Additionally, we found that inhibitors of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway exacerbate SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Notably, we discovered that lactoferrin, a glycoprotein classically found in secretory fluids, including mammalian milk, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in the nanomolar range in all cell models with multiple modes of action, including blockage of virus attachment to cellular heparan sulfate and enhancement of interferon responses. Given its safety profile, lactoferrin is a readily translatable therapeutic option for the management of COVID-19.\n\nIMPORTANCESince its emergence in China in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic. Repurposing of FDA-approved drugs is a promising strategy for identifying rapidly deployable treatments for COVID-19. Herein, we developed a pipeline for quantitative high-throughput image-based screening of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human cells that led to the identification of several FDA-approved drugs and clinical candidates with in vitro antiviral activity.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional enhancers have been defined by their ability to operate independent of distance and orientation in plasmid-based reporter assays of gene expression. Currently, histone marks are used heavily to identify and define enhancers but both methods do not consider the endogenous role of an enhancer in the context of native chromatin. We employed a combination of genomic editing, single cell analyses, and sequencing approaches to investigate a Nanog-associated cis-regulatory element (CRE) which has been reported by others to be either an alternative promoter or a super-enhancer (SE). We first demonstrate both distance and orientation independence in native chromatin, eliminating the issues raised with plasmid-based approaches. We also demonstrate that the dominant SE modulates Nanog globally and operates by recruiting and/or initiating RNA Polymerase II. Our studies have important implications to how transcriptional enhancers are defined and how they regulate gene expression.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYDifferent DNA elements help regulate the levels of gene expression. One such element are enhancers, short sequences that interact with genes to modulate levels of expression but can operate over large distances. Previously, these sequences were defined by their ability to regulate expression independent of their distance from a gene and the orientation of the sequence. However, these characteristics were found using techniques that did not recapitulate the native environment. Here, we have shown that an enhancer of one gene is indeed an enhancer by testing its distance and orientation-independence within the native environment. We also show that the mechanisms by which the enhancer is regulating expression is by controlling the levels of RNA Polymerase II at a gene. RNA Polymerase II is the protein that converts the gene sequence to a form usable by a cell, called mRNA. This is interesting because while this has been considered historically the main way enhancers operate, more recent work has focused on other, later regulatory steps involved in controlling mRNA production.",

Since only a small proportion of individuals exposed to HP-related antigens develop the disease, a genetic variation may play a role in disease development.\n\nMethodsIn this small-scale study, 24 patients diagnosed with HP were matched with control group who shared the patients environment and were exposed to the same HP-associated antigens. Logistic regression was employed to identify Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with HP. Next genes associated with HP were identified using sequence kernel association test (SKAT) analysis. Last, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Oncology (GO) enrichment analysis were employed to find HP signaling pathways using SNPs coded on genes and on non-coding genes, respectively.\n\nResultsGiven the small sample size, no single SNPs or genes were identified to be significantly associated with HP after adjustment for multiple testing. After P-value adjustment, the KEGG and GO pathway enrichment analysis identified 11 and 20 significant pathways respectively using SNPs coded on genes. Among these pathways, Cell cycle, Proteasome and Base excision repair had previously reported to be associated with lung function.\n\nConclusionThis is the first GWAS study identifying genetic factors associated with HP. Although no significant associations at SNPs/gene level were identified, there were significant pathways that are identified associated with HP which need further investigation in large cohorts.",

    "abstract": "Memory T cells induced by previous infections can influence the course of new viral infections. Little is known about the pattern of SARS-CoV-2 specific pre-existing memory T cells in human. Here, we first studied T cell responses to structural (nucleocapsid protein, NP) and non-structural (NSP-7 and NSP13 of ORF1) regions of SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent from COVID-19 (n=24). In all of them we demonstrated the presence of CD4 and CD8 T cells recognizing multiple regions of the NP protein. We then show that SARS-recovered patients (n=23), 17 years after the 2003 outbreak, still possess long-lasting memory T cells reactive to SARS-NP, which displayed robust cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 NP. Surprisingly, we observed a differential pattern of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell immunodominance in individuals with no history of SARS, COVID-19 or contact with SARS/COVID-19 patients (n=18). Half of them (9/18) possess T cells targeting the ORF-1 coded proteins NSP7 and 13, which were rarely detected in COVID-19- and SARS-recovered patients. Epitope characterization of NSP7-specific T cells showed recognition of protein fragments with low homology to \"common cold\" human coronaviruses but conserved among animal betacoranaviruses.\n\nThus, infection with betacoronaviruses induces strong and long-lasting T cell immunity to the structural protein NP. Understanding how pre-existing ORF-1-specific T cells present in the general population impact susceptibility and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is of paramount importance for the management of the current COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Viral entry mechanisms for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are an important aspect of virulence. Proposed mechanisms involve host cell membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs), such as transmembrane serine protease isoform 2 (TMPRSS2). The distribution of expression of these genes across cell types representing multiple organ systems in healthy individuals has been recently demonstrated. However, comorbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease are highly prevalent in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated with worse outcomes. Whether these conditions contribute directly to SARS-CoV-2 virulence remain unclear. Here we show that the expression levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and other viral entry-related genes are modulated in target organs of select disease states. In tissues such as heart, which normally express ACE2 but minimal TMPRSS2, we found that TMPRSS2 as well as other TTSPs are elevated in individuals with comorbidities vs healthy individuals. Additionally, we found increased expression of viral entry-related genes in the settings of hypertension, cancer or smoking across target organ systems. Our results demonstrate that common comorbidities may contribute directly to SARS-CoV-2 virulence and suggest new therapeutic targets to improve outcomes in vulnerable patient populations.",

    "abstract": "Accommodating large increases in sample workloads has presented one of the biggest challenges to clinical laboratories during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the implementation of new automated detection systems, and previous efficiencies such as barcoding, electronic data transfer and extensive robotics, throughput capacities have struggled to meet the demand. Sample pooling has been suggested as an additional strategy to further address this need. The greatest concern with this approach in a clinical setting is the potential for reduced sensitivity, particularly the risk of false negative results when weak positive samples are pooled. To investigate this possibility, detection rates in pooled samples were evaluated, with extensive assessment of pools containing weak positive specimens. Additionally, the frequency of occurrence of weak positive samples across ten weeks of the pandemic were reviewed. Weak positive specimens were detected in all five-sample pools but failed to be detected in four of the 24 nine-sample pools tested. Weak positive samples comprised an average 16.5% of the positive specimens tested during the pandemic thus far, slightly increasing in frequency during later weeks. Other aspects of the testing process should be considered, however, such as accessioning and reporting, which are not streamlined and may be complicated by pooling procedures. Therefore, the impact on the entire laboratory process needs to be carefully assessed prior to implementing such a strategy.",

Of the 392 ticks tested, 37 (9.4%) scored positive for at least one pathogen with Hepatozoon canis being the most prevalent (5.4%), followed by Ehrlichia canis (1.8%), Babesia vogeli (1%), Anaplasma platys (0.8%) and Rickettsia spp. (1%) [including Rickettsia sp. (0.5%), Rickettsia asembonensis (0.3%), Rickettsia felis (0.3%)]. Out of 248 fleas tested, 106 (42.7%) were harboring at least one pathogen with R. felis being the most common (19.4%), followed by Bartonella spp. (16.5%), Rickettsia asembonensis (10.9%) and Candidatus Rickettsia senegalensis (0.4%). Furthermore, 35 Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato ticks were subjected to phylogenetic analysis, of which 34 ticks belonged to the tropical and only one belonged to the temperate lineage (Rh. sanguineus sensu stricto). Our data reveals the circulation of different VBPs in ticks and fleas of dogs and cats from Asia, including zoonotic agents, which may represent a potential risk to animal and human health.\n\nAuthor summaryTicks and fleas are among the most important vectors of pathogens infesting many animal species including humans worldwide. Although a number of vector-borne pathogens have been detected in dogs and cats from East and Southeast Asia, investigation in ticks and fleas collected from them are scant. In order to provide an overview of the pathogens circulating in ticks and fleas from companion dogs and cats in Asia, ticks (n = 392) and fleas (n = 248) were collected from privately-owned dogs and cats from China, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Philippines and Vietnam and molecularly screened for the presence of pathogens. Overall, multiple pathogens were found in ticks (i.e., Babesia vogeli, Hepatozoon canis, Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma platys and Rickettsia spp.) and fleas (i.e., Rickettsia spp. and Bartonella spp.) from the sampling areas. Of the ticks tested, 9.4% scored positive for at least one pathogen and of fleas 42.7% harbored at least one pathogen with Rickettsia felis being the most common (19.4%). Overall, of the detected pathogens, R. felis stood out as the most important due to its zoonotic potential. The result of this study should increase awareness among pet owners and veterinary practitioners regarding the importance of ticks and fleas, and their transmitted pathogens.",

    "abstract": "In all of the clinical trials for COVID-19 conducted thus far and among those ongoing involving chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, the drug substance used has invariably been chloroquine (CQ) diphosphate or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) sulfate, i.e., the phosphoric or sulfuric acid salt of a racemic mixture of R- and S-enantiomer (50/50), respectively. As a result, the clinical outcome from previous CQ or HCQ trials were, in fact, the collective manifestation of both R and S- enantiomers with inherent different pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, and toxicity liabilities. Our data for the first time demonstrated the stereoselective difference of CQ and HCQ against live SARS-CoV-2 virus in a Biosafety Level 3 laboratory. S-chloroquine (S-CQ) and S-hydroxychloroquine (S-HCQ) significantly more active against SARS-CoV-2, as compared to R-CQ and R-HCQ, respectively. In addition, Mpro, as one of the critical enzymes for viral transcription and replication, also exhibited an enantioselective binding affinity toward the S-enantiomers. The most significant finding from this study is the pronounced difference of the two enantiomers of CQ and HCQ observed in hERG inhibition assay. The IC50 value of S-HCQ was higher than 20 M against hERG channel, which was much less active over all tested CQ and HCQ compounds. Moreover, S-HCQ alone did not prolong QT interval in guinea pigs after 3 days and 6 days of administration, indicating a much lower cardiac toxicity potential. With these and previous findings on the enantio-differentiated metabolism, we recommend that future clinical studies should employ S-HCQ, substantially free of the R-enantiomer, to potentially improve the therapeutic index for the treatment of COVID-19 over the racemic CQ and HCQ.",

Most of the currently used methods for assessment of the effective diffusion coefficient rely on the point-source paradigm.\n\nWe propose a method for the quantitative characterization of the diffusion process in the brains parenchyma using a set of images recorded in the experiment during the spreading of a fluorescent dye. Our method exploits the frame-wise comparison of experimental data with a set of images that would be observed for an ideal diffusion process within the same topology. We obtain this reference set of images using blurring the image with an appropriate kernel function, and the degree of such blurring correlates with the spreading process of a dye. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method using (i) the simulated surrogate data, (ii) the set of experimentally recorded fluorescent images of the isolated event of blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening, and (iii) the images of massive multi-source spreading of fluorescent dye.",

Here we report a novel conditioning method employing glass marbles in batch cultures to enhance secondary metabolite production by Streptomyces sp. The marbles seem to spatially separate aerial and submerged mycelia in the flask which was necessary for the qualitative and quantitative enhancement of metabolite production of secondary metabolites. The method also offers shorter incubation period compared to conventional methods for effective production. Further, using a combination of this method and response surface methodology we could enhance the production of antimycobacterial molecules chrysomycin A and B significantly.\n\nImportanceRediscovery of existing molecules and lack of techniques to induce production of secondary metabolites are the major bottlenecks associated with drug discovery of novel bioactive molecules from Streptomyces, the major source of marketable drugs today. We found a new method to increase the diversity and quantity of secondary metabolites in two Streptomyces species. This method thus enhances the chance of finding novel active principles from Streptomyces.",

    "abstract": "The study of response to cancer treatments has benefited greatly from the contribution of different omics data but their interpretation is sometimes difficult. Some mathematical models based on prior biological knowledge of signalling pathways, facilitate this interpretation but often require fitting of their parameters using perturbation data. We propose a more qualitative mechanistic approach, based on logical formalism and on the sole mapping and interpretation of omics data, and able to recover differences in sensitivity to gene inhibition without model training. This approach is showcased by the study of BRAF inhibition in patients with melanomas and colorectal cancers who experience significant differences in sensitivity despite similar omics profiles.\n\nWe first gather information from literature and build a logical model summarizing the regulatory network of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway surrounding BRAF, with factors involved in the BRAF inhibition resistance mechanisms. The relevance of this model is verified by automatically assessing that it qualitatively reproduces response or resistance behaviours identified in the literature. Data from over 100 melanoma and colorectal cancer cell lines are then used to validate the models ability to explain differences in sensitivity. This generic model is transformed into personalized cell line-specific logical models by integrating the omics information of the cell lines as constraints of the model. The use of mutations alone allows personalized models to correlate significantly with experimental sensitivities to BRAF inhibition, both from drug and CRISPR targeting, and even better with the joint use of mutations and RNA, supporting multi-omics mechanistic models. A comparison of these untrained models with learning approaches highlights similarities in interpretation and complementarity depending on the size of the datasets.\n\nThis parsimonious pipeline, which can easily be extended to other biological questions, makes it possible to explore the mechanistic causes of the response to treatment, on an individualized basis.\n\nAuthor summaryWe constructed a logical model to study, from a dynamical perspective, the differences between melanomas and colorectal cancers that share the same BRAF mutations but exhibit different sensitivities to anti-BRAF treatments. The model was built from the literature and completed from existing pathway databases. The model encompasses the key proteins of the MAPK pathway and was made specific to each cancer cell line (100 melanoma and colorectal cell lines from public database) using available omics data, including mutations and RNAseq data. It can simulate the effect of drugs and show high correlation with experimental results. Moreover, the structure of the network confirms both the importance of the reactivation of the MAPK pathway through CRAF and the involvement of PI3K/AKT pathway in the mechanisms of resistance to BRAF inhibition.\n\nThe study shows that, because of the low number of samples, the mechanistic approach that we propose provides different insights than powerful standard machine learning methodologies would, showing the complementarity between the two approaches. An important aspect to mention is that the mechanistic approach presented here does not rely on training datasets but directly interprets and maps data on the model to simulate drug responses.",

    "abstract": "The removal of unwanted genetic material is a key aspect in many synthetic biology efforts, and often requires preliminary knowledge of which genomic regions are dispensable. Typically, these efforts are guided by transposon mutagenesis studies, coupled to deep-sequencing (TnSeq) to identify insertion points and gene essentiality. However, epistatic interactions can cause unforeseen changes in essentiality after the deletion of a gene, leading to the redundancy of these essentiality maps. Here, we present LoxTnSeq, a new methodology to generate and catalogue libraries of genome reduction mutants. LoxTnSeq combines random integration of lox sites by transposon mutagenesis, and the generation of mutants via cre recombinase, catalogued via deep-sequencing. When LoxTnSeq was applied to the naturally genome reduced bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae, we obtained a mutant pool containing 285 unique deletions. These deletions spanned from >50 bp to 28 Kb, which represent 21% of the total genome. LoxTnSeq also highlighted large regions of non-essential genes that could be removed simultaneously, and other non-essential regions that could not, providing a guide for future genome reductions.",

In the present study we investigated the effect of BAG from the CaSiO3-Ca3(PO4)2 system addition to the bioactivity of RMGIC. The BAG containing 10, 15, and 20% of P2O5 (denoted as CSP10, 15, and 20) were used in the study to modify the powder of RMGIC, with apatite wollastonite (AWG) was chosen for a comparison. The surface bioactivity was assessed using XRD, FT-IR, and SEM analysis after specimen immersion in the simulated body fluid (SBF). Measurement of Ca, P, F, Sr, and Al was conducted for the remaining SBF. Cells studies were done to evaluate cell attachment, proliferation, and differentiation on the RMGIC containing BAG compared to the one without BAG. Results of Sr and Al analysis lead to the conclusion that addition of BAG may not influence stability of the matrix of the cement. It was also confirmed that addition of bioactive glass was positive factor indicating excellent ions exchange in SBF and spontaneous growth of apatite by consuming the Ca and P ions in the surrounding fluid. The ability of osteoblasts differentiation on the four types of bioactive cements were higher than that of RMGIC without BAG. These results might provide novel insights into the development of a new generation of osteoconductive biomedical materials.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCOVID-19 is a recent pandemic that started to spread out worldwide from Wuhan, China. This disease is caused by a newly discovered strain of the coronavirus, namely SARS CoV-2. Lung cancer patients are reported to be more susceptible to COVID-19 infection. To evaluate the probable reasons behind the excessive susceptibility and fatality of lung cancer patients to COVID-19 infection, we targeted two most crucial biomarkers of COVID-19, ACE2 and CXCL10. ACE2 plays a vital role in the SARS CoV-2 entry into the host cell while CXCL10 is a cytokine mainly responsible for the lung cell damage involving in a cytokine storm.\n\nMethodsFirstly, we used the TIMER, UALCAN and GEPIA2 databases to analyze the expression and correlation of ACE2 and CXCL10 in LUAD and LUSC. After that, using the cBioPortal database, we performed an analytical study to determine the genetic changes in ACE2 and CXCL10 protein sequences that are responsible for lung cancer development. Finally, we analyzed different functional approaches of ACE2, CXCL10 and their co-expressed genes associated with lung cancer and COVID-19 development by using the PANTHER database.\n\nResultsInitially, we observed that ACE2 and CXCL10 are mostly overexpressed in LUAD and LUSC. We also found the functional significance of ACE2 and CXCL10 in lung cancer development by determining the genetic alteration frequency in their amino acid sequences. Lastly, by doing the functional assessment of the targeted genes, we identified that ACE2 and CXCL10 along with their commonly co-expressed genes are respectively involved in the binding activity and immune responses in case of lung cancer and COVID-19 infection.\n\nConclusionsFinally, on the basis of this systemic analysis, we came to the conclusion that ACE2 and CXCL10 are possible biomarkers responsible for the higher susceptibility and fatality of lung cancer patients towards the COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Activating FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutations occur in approximately 30% of all acute myeloid leukaemias (AMLs) and are associated with poor prognosis. The limited clinical efficacy of FLT3 inhibitor monotherapy has highlighted the need for alternative therapeutic targets and treatments for FLT3-mutant AML. Using human and murine models of MLL-rearranged AML harbouring FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) and primary patient samples, we have demonstrated that FLT3-ITD promotes serine uptake and serine synthesis via transcriptional regulation of neutral amino acid transporters (SLC1A4 and SLC1A5) and genes in the de novo serine synthesis pathway (PHGDH and PSAT1). Mechanistically, dysregulation of serine metabolism in FLT3-mutant AML is dependent on the mTORC1-ATF4 axis, that drives RNA-Pol II occupancy at PHGDH, PSAT1, SLC1A4 and SLC1A5. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of the de novo serine synthesis pathway selectively inhibited the proliferation of FLT3-ITD AML cells, and this was potentiated by withdrawal of exogenous serine. Purine supplementation effectively rescued the antiproliferative effect of inhibiting de novo serine synthesis, consistent with the idea that serine fuels purine nucleotide synthesis in FLT3-mutant AML. Pharmacological inhibition of the de novo serine synthesis pathway, using the PHGDH inhibitor WQ-2101, sensitises FLT3-mutant AML cells to the standard of care chemotherapy agent cytarabine via exacerbation of DNA damage. Collectively, these data reveal new insights as to how FLT3 mutations reprogram metabolism in AML, and reveal a combination therapy strategy to improve the treatment of FLT3-mutant AML.\n\nStatement of SignificanceFLT3 mutations are common in AML and are associated with poor prognosis. We show that FLT3-ITD stimulates serine metabolism, thereby rendering FLT3-ITD leukemias dependent on serine for proliferation and survival. This metabolic dependency can be exploited pharmacologically to sensitize FLT3-mutant AML to chemotherapy.",

Biomarker evidence suggests that around this time there was a rapid shift from a predominantly bacterial-dominated world to more complex ecosystems governed by eukaryotic primary productivity. The resulting  Rise of the algae led to dramatically altered food webs that were much more efficient in terms of nutrient and energy transfer. Yet, what triggered this ecological shift? In this study we examined the theory that it was the alleviation of phosphorus (P) deficiency that gave eukaryotic alga the prime opportunity to flourish. We performed laboratory experiments on the cyanobacterium Synochystis salina and the eukaryotic algae Tetraselmis suecia and examined their ability to compete for phosphorus. Both these organisms co-occur in modern European coastal waters and are not known to have any allelopathic capabilities. The strains were cultured in mono and mixed cultures in chemostats across a range of dissolved organic phosphorus (DIP) conditions to reflect modern and ancient oceanic conditions of 0.2 M P and 2 M P, respectively. Our results show that the cyanobacteria outcompete the algae at the low input (0.2 M P) treatment, yet the eukaryotic algae were not completely excluded and remained a constant background component in the mixed-culture experiments. Also, despite its relatively large cell size, the algae T. suecia had a high affinity for DIP. With DIP input concentrations resembling modern-day levels (2 M), the eukaryotic algae could effectively compete against the cyanobacteria in terms of total biomass production. These results suggest that the availability of phosphorus could have influenced the global expansion of eukaryotic algae. However, P limitation does not seem to explain the complete absence of eukaryotic algae in the biomarker record before ca. 750 Ma.",

This technology is also used for the identification and annotation of genes of various organisms, including viruses. Bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1) is an important pathogen of cattle worldwide. However, the transcriptome of this virus is still largely unannotated. This study reports the profiling of the dynamic lytic transcriptome of BoHV-1 using two long-read sequencing (LRS) techniques, the Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) MinION, and the Illumina LoopSeq synthetic LRS methods, using multiple library preparation protocols. In this work, we annotated viral mRNAs and non-coding transcripts, and a large number of transcript isoforms, including transcription start and end sites, as well as splice variants of BoHV-1. Very long polycistronic and complex viral transcripts were also detected. Our analysis demonstrated an extremely complex pattern of transcriptional overlaps formed by transcriptional read-throughs or overlapping the 5-untranslated regions of divergently-oriented transcripts. The impact of the viral infection on the host cell transcriptome was also assessed. Our results demonstrate that genes associated with antiviral response as well as viral transcription and translation are upregulated.",

    "abstract": "Mastitis is a multi-etiological and complex disease causing inflammation of parenchyma of mammary glands is a problem in many dairy herds. The objective of this study was isolation and identification of the pathogenic bacteria that cause bovine clinical mastitis. A cross sectional study was undertaken from November 2018 to April 2019 on small scale and government dairy farms in Asella town. Cows were examined directly at quarter and teat level for clinical manifestation. A total of 83 milk samples were collected from 46 cows that shows clinical sign of mastitis from a total of 12 farms. Isolation and identification of major bacterial species was carried out by culturing on different media and using primary and secondary biochemical tests. Out of the 83 samples collected and examined, all (100%) were positive for cultural isolation of bacterial species. The bacteria were identified to genus and species level. Among the 83 isolates 32 (38.6%) were S. aureus, 24 (28.9%) were Staphylococcus intermedius and 6 (7.2%) were Staphyloco ccus hyicus, other bacteria like Escherichia coli 12(14.5%), Streptococcus species 2 (2.4%) were also isolated. Bacillus Species 2 (2.4%), Proteus species 2(2.4%) and 3 (3.6%) of them were mixed bacterial infections. The present study revealed that both contagious and environmental bacterial pathogens were responsible for the occurrence of clinical mastitis. Proper milking practices and farm husbandry practices as well as future detailed studies up to the species level and on antibiotic profiles of the pathogens are needed.",

    "abstract": "H9N2 avian influenza viruses circulate in poultry throughout much of Asia, the Middle East and Africa. These viruses cause huge economic damage to poultry production systems and pose a zoonotic threat both in their own right as well as in the generation of novel zoonotic viruses, for example H7N9. In recent years it has been observed that H9N2 viruses have further adapted to poultry, becoming more highly transmissible and causing higher morbidity and mortality. Here, we investigate the molecular basis for this increased virulence, comparing a virus from the 1990s and a contemporary field strain. The modern virus replicated to higher titres in various systems and this difference mapped to a single amino acid polymorphism at position 26 of the endonuclease domain shared by the PA and PA-X proteins. This change was responsible for the virulent phenotype and extended tissue tropism seen in chickens. Although the PA K26E change correlated with increased host cell shutoff activity of the PA-X protein in vitro, it could not be overridden by frameshift site mutations that block PA-X expression and therefore increased PA-X activity could not explain the differences in replication phenotype. Instead, this indicates these differences are due to subtle effects on PA function. This work gives insight into the ongoing evolution and poultry adaptation of H9N2 and other avian influenza viruses and helps us understand the soaring morbidity and mortality rates in the field, as well as rapidly expanding geographical range seen in these viruses.\n\nAuthor SummaryAvian influenza viruses, such as H9N2, cause huge economic damage to poultry production worldwide and are additionally considered potential pandemic threats. Understanding how these viruses evolve in their natural hosts is key to effective control strategies. In the Middle East and South Asia an older H9N2 virus strain has been replaced by a new reassortant strain with greater fitness. Here we take representative viruses and investigate the genetic basis for this  fitness. A single mutation in the virus was responsible for greater fitness, enabling high growth of the contemporary H9N2 virus in cells, as well as in chickens. The genetic mutation that modulates this change is within the viral PA protein, a part of the virus polymerase gene that contributes in viral replication as well as contribute in the virus accessory functions - however we find that the fitness effect is specifically due to changes in the protein polymerase activity.",

    "abstract": "Human erythrocytes are indispensable for Plasmodium falciparum development. Unlike other eukaryotic cells, there is no existing erythroid cell line capable of supporting long-term P. falciparum in vitro experiments. Consequently, invasion phenotyping experiments rely on erythrocytes of different backgrounds. However, the contribution of the erythrocytes variation in influencing invasion rates remains unknown, which presents a challenge for conducting large-scale comparative studies. Here, we used erythrocytes of different blood groups harboring different hemoglobin genotypes to assess the relative contribution of blood donor variability in P. falciparum invasion phenotyping assays. For each donor, we investigated the relationship between parasite invasion phenotypes and erythrocyte phenotypic characteristics, including; the expression levels of surface receptors (e.g. the human glycophorins A and C, the complement receptor 1 and decay accelerating factor), blood groups (e.g. ABO/Rh system), and hemoglobin genotypes (e.g. AA, AS and AC). Across all donors, there were significant differences in invasion efficiency following treatment with either neuraminidase, trypsin or chymotrypsin relative to the control erythrocytes. Primarily, we showed that the levels of key erythrocyte surface receptors and their sensitivity to enzyme treatment, significantly differed across donors. However, invasion efficiency correlated neither with susceptibility to enzyme treatment nor with the levels of the selected erythrocyte surface receptors. Upon further analysis, we found no relationship between P. falciparum invasion phenotype and blood group or hemoglobin genotype.\n\nImportanceAssays to decipher P. falciparum invasion phenotypes are of great importance in the quest for an efficient malaria vaccine. Malaria associated mortality is mainly attributed to the blood stage of the parasites life cycle, a major focus of vaccine development strategies. Further, testing and validating blood stage vaccines necessitates conducting large-scale studies in endemic countries. However, comparing results from such studies is challenged by the lack of standard assays. As human erythrocytes play a pivotal role in P. falciparum invasion assays, the need to investigate the effect of blood donor variability in the outcome of such assays is apparent. The significance of our study is in reporting the absence of relationship between P. falciparum invasion efficiency and commonly shared erythrocyte features across different erythrocyte donors, therefore emphasizing the need to consider erythrocyte donor uniformity and to anticipate challenges associated to blood donor variability in early stages of large-scale study design.",

    "abstract": "The extent and ecological significance of intraspecific diversity within marine microbial populations is still poorly understood, and it remains unclear if such strain-level microdiversity will affect fitness and persistence in a rapidly changing ocean environment. In this study, we cultured 11 sympatric strains of the ubiquitous marine picocyanobacterium Synechococcus isolated from a Narragansett Bay (Rhode Island, USA) phytoplankton community thermal selection experiment. Despite all 11 isolates being highly similar (with average nucleotide identities of >99.9%, with 98.6-100% of the genome aligning), thermal performance curves revealed selection at warm and cool temperatures had subdivided the initial population into thermotypes with pronounced differences in maximum growth temperatures. Within the fine-scale genetic diversity that did exist within this population, the two divergent thermal ecotypes differed at a locus containing genes for the phycobilisome antenna complex. Our study demonstrates that present-day marine microbial populations can contain microdiversity in the form of cryptic but environmentally-relevant thermotypes that may increase their resilience to future rising temperatures.\n\nSignificanceNumerous studies exist comparing the responses of distinct taxonomic groups of marine microbes to a warming ocean (interspecific thermal diversity). For example, Synechococcus, a nearly globally distributed unicellular marine picocyanobacterium that makes significant contributions to oceanic primary productivity, contains numerous taxonomically distinct lineages with well documented temperature relationships. Little is known though about the diversity of functional responses to temperature within a given population where genetic similarity is high (intraspecific thermal diversity). This study suggests that understanding the extent of this functional intraspecific microdiversity is an essential prerequisite to predicting the resilience of biogeochemically essential microbial groups such as marine Synechococcus to a changing climate.",

    "abstract": "Mosquito-borne diseases cause significant social and economic damage across much of the globe. New biotechnologies that utilise manipulations of the mosquito genome have been developed to combat disease. The successful implementation of genetic mosquito control technologies may depend upon ecological, evolutionary and environmental factors, as well as the specifications of the chosen technology. Understanding the influence of these external factors will help inform how best to deploy a chosen technology to control vectors of infectious diseases. We use a continuous-time stochastic spatial network model of a mosquito life-cycle coupled to population genetics models to investigate the impact of releasing seven types of genetic control technology: a self-limiting lethal gene, two underdominance threshold gene drives, two homing gene drives and two Wolbachia systems. We apply the mathematical framework to understand control interventions of two archetypes of mosquito species: a short-range dispersing Aedes aegypti and comparatively longer-range dispersing Anopheles gambiae. We show that mosquito dispersal behaviour is an extremely important factor in determining the outcome of a release programme. Assortative mating - where the mating success of genetically modified males is lower than their wild counterparts - can facilitate the spatial containment of gene drives. The rapid evolution of strong mating preference can damage the efficacy of control efforts for all control technologies. We suggest that there cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach to regulation and implementation of vector control; there must be application-specific control plans that take account of understudied ecological, evolutionary and environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "The winged insects of the order Diptera are colloquially named for their most recognizable phenotype: flight. These insects rely on flight for a number of important life history traits, like dispersal, foraging, and courtship. Despite the importance of flight, relatively little is known about the genetic architecture of variation for flight performance. Accordingly, we sought to uncover the genetic modifiers of flight using a measure of flies reaction and response to an abrupt drop in a vertical flight column. We conducted an association study using 197 of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) lines, and identified a combination of additive and marginal variants, epistatic interactions, whole genes, and enrichment across interaction networks. We functionally validated 13 of these candidate genes (Adgf-A/Adgf-A2/CG32181, bru1, CadN, CG11073, CG15236, CG9766, CREG, Dscam4, form3, fry, Lasp/CG9692, Pde6, Snoo) contribution to flight, two of which (fry and Snoo) also validate a whole gene analysis we introduce for the DGRP: PEGASUS_flies. Overall, our results suggest modifiers of muscle and wing morphology, and peripheral and central nervous system assembly and function are all important for flight performance. Additionally, we identified ppk23, an Acid Sensing Ion Channel (ASIC) homolog, as an important hub for epistatic interactions. These results represent a snapshot of the genetic modifiers affecting drop-response flight performance in Drosophila, with implications for other insects. It also draws connections between genetic modifiers of performance and BMP signaling and ASICs as targets for treating neurodegeneration and neurodysfunction.\n\nAuthor summaryInsect flight is a widely recognizable phenotype of winged insects, hence the name: flies. While fruit flies, or Drosophila melanogaster, are a genetically tractable model, flight performance is a highly integrative phenotype, making it challenging to comprehensively identify the genetic modifiers that contribute to its genetic architecture. Accordingly, we screened 197 Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel lines for their ability to react and respond to an abrupt drop. Using several computational tools, we successfully identified several additive, marginal, and epistatic variants, as well as whole genes and altered sub-networks of gene-gene and protein-protein interaction networks, demonstrating the benefits of using multiple methodologies to elucidate the genetic architecture of complex traits more generally. Many of these significant genes and variants mapped to regions of the genome that affect development of sensory and motor neurons, wing and muscle development, and regulation of transcription factors. We also introduce PEGASUS_flies, a Drosophila-adapted version of the PEGASUS platform first used in human studies, to infer gene-level significance of association based on the distribution of individual variant P-values. Our results contribute to the debate over the relative importance of individual, additive factors and epistatic, or higher order, interactions, in the mapping of genotype to phenotype.",

A subsequent genome-wide antisense oligonucleotide-knockdown screen of a robust set of BEC- and LEC-specific lncRNAs identified LETR1 as a critical gatekeeper of the global LEC transcriptome. Deep RNA-DNA, RNA-protein, and phenotype rescue analyses revealed that LETR1 acts as a nuclear trans-acting lncRNA modulating, via key epigenetic factors, the expression of essential target genes, including KLF4 and SEMA3C, governing the growth and migratory ability of LECs. Together, our study provides new evidence supporting the intriguing concept that every cell type expresses precise lncRNA signatures to control lineage-specific regulatory programs.",

    "abstract": "Tailocins are bactericidal protein complexes produced by a wide variety of bacteria to compete against closely related strains. Like tailed bacteriophages, with whom they share an evolutionary and morphological relationship, tailocins bind and kill a narrow spectrum of target cells. Thanks to their high specificity, tailocins have garnered recent attention for their potential as precision antibacterial agents. Nevertheless, the field currently lacks a systematic investigation of genetic determinants of tailocin sensitivity. Here, we employed barcoded transposon-insertion mutant libraries and comparative genomics to assess genetic contributions to tailocin sensitivity in pseudomonads. Our mutant screens identified O-specific antigen (OSA) composition and display as most important in defining sensitivity to our tailocins. Additionally, the screens suggest lipopolysaccharide (LPS) thinning as a mechanism by which resistant strains can become more sensitive to tailocins. Our comparative genomics analyses show a loose relationship between OSA biosynthetic genes and tailocin sensitivity, as well as sensitivity nuances that require further investigation. Overall, our data reinforces the model that LPS molecules can act as either a receptor for, or shield against, tailocin binding and killing. This work offers insight into the specificity of tailocins and tailocin-mediated competition, informing the potential use of tailocins in microbiome manipulation and antibacterial therapy.",

    "abstract": "Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) remain some of the most devastating human diseases, and recent outbreaks of Ebola virus disease (EVD) 1,2 and Lassa fever (LF) 3,4 highlight the urgent need for sensitive, field-deployable tests to diagnose them 5,6. Here we develop CRISPR-Cas13a-based (SHERLOCK) diagnostics targeting Ebola virus (EBOV) and Lassa virus (LASV), with both fluorescent and lateral flow readouts. We demonstrate on laboratory and clinical samples the sensitivity of these assays and the capacity of the SHERLOCK platform to handle virus-specific diagnostic challenges. Our EBOV diagnostic detects both the L and NP genes, thereby eliminating the potential for false positive results caused by the rVSV{Delta}G-ZEBOV-GP live attenuated vaccine. Our two LASV diagnostics together capture 90% of known viral diversity and demonstrate that CRISPR-RNAs (crRNAs) can be effectively multiplexed to provide greater coverage of known viral diversity. We performed safety testing to demonstrate the efficacy of our HUDSON protocol in heat-inactivating and chemically treating VHF viruses before SHERLOCK testing, eliminating the need for an extraction. We developed a user-friendly field protocol and mobile application (HandLens) to report results, facilitating SHERLOCKs use in endemic regions. Finally, we successfully deployed our tests in Sierra Leone and Nigeria in response to recent outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNA (miRNA) play a significant role in the pathogenesis of complex neurodegenerative diseases, including age-related macular degeneration, acting as post-transcriptional gene suppressors through their association with argonaute (AGO) protein family members. However, to understand their role in disease, investigation into the regulatory nature of miRNA with their targets is required. To identify the active-miRnome-targetome interactions in the degenerating retina, AGO2 HITS-CLIP was performed using a mouse model of retinal degeneration. Analysis revealed a similar miRnome between healthy and damaged retinas, however, a shift in the active targetome was observed. This shift was also demonstrated by a change in the seed binding regions of miR-124-3p, the most abundant retinal miRNA loaded in AGO2. Following damage, AGO2 was localised to the inner retinal layers indicating a locational miRNA response to retinal damage. This study provides important insight into the alteration of miRNA regulatory activity that occurs as a response to retinal degeneration.",

Small particles produced by the drywood termite Incisitermes marginipennis and the European house borer (EHB) Hylotrupes bajulus during feeding in construction timber, were used. Frass is a powdery material of particularly consistent quality that is essentially biologically processed wood mixed with debris of wood and faeces. The filigree-like particles flow easily permitting the build-up of wood-based structures in a layer wise fashion using the Binder Jetting printing process. The quality of powders produced by different insect species was compared along with the processing steps and properties of the printed parts. Drywood termite frass with a HR = 1.1 with {rho}Bulk = 0.67 g.cm-3 and {rho}Tap = 0.74 g.cm-3 was perfectly suited to deposition of uniformly packed layers in 3D printing.

    "abstract": "Biallelic variants in TBC1-domain containing kinase (TBCK) cause intellectual disability in children. It remains unclear how variants in TBCK lead to a neurodevelopmental disorder and what biological factors modulate the variability of clinical severity. Previous studies showed increased autophagosomes in patients sharing the truncating (p.R126X) Boricua homozygous TBCK variant, who exhibit a severe and progressive neurodegenerative phenotype. Since defects in mitophagy are linked to neurodegenerative disorders, we tested whether mitophagy and mitochondrial function are altered in TBCK-/- fibroblasts. Our data shows significant accumulation of mitophagosomes, reduced mitochondrial respiratory capacity, and mtDNA depletion. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction correlates with the severity of the neurological phenotype. Since effective mitophagy and degradation of mitophagosomes ultimately depends on successful lysosomal degradation, we also tested lysosomal function. Our data shows that lysosomal proteolytic function is significantly reduced in TBCK-/- fibroblasts. Moreover, acidifying lysosomal nanoparticles rescue the mitochondrial respiratory defects, suggesting that impaired mitochondrial quality control secondary to lysosomal dysfunction, may play an important role in the pathogenicity of this rare neurodevelopmental disorder and predict the degree of disease progression and neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Yeast cells survive in stationary phase culture by entering quiescence, which is measured by colony forming capacity upon nutrient re-exposure. Yeast chronological lifespan (CLS) studies, employing the comprehensive collection of gene knockout strains, have correlated weakly between independent laboratories, which is hypothesized to reflect differential interaction between the deleted genes, auxotrophy, media composition and other assay conditions influencing quiescence. This hypothesis was investigated by high-throughput quiescence profiling of the parental prototrophic strain, from which the gene deletion strain libraries were constructed, and all possible auxotrophic allele combinations in that background. Defined media resembling human cell culture media promoted long-term quiescence, and was used to assess effects of glucose, ammonium sulfate, auxotrophic nutrient availability, Target of Rapamycin signaling, and replication stress. Frequent, high-replicate measurements of colony forming capacity from cultures aged past 60 days provided profiles of quiescence phenomena such as gasping and hormesis. Media acidification was assayed in parallel to assess correlation. Influences of leucine, methionine, glucose, and ammonium sulfate metabolism were clarified, and a role for lysine metabolism newly characterized, while histidine and uracil perturbations had less impact. Interactions occurred between glucose, ammonium sulfate, auxotrophy, auxotrophic nutrient limitation, aeration, TOR signaling, and/or replication stress. Weak correlation existed between media acidification and maintenance of quiescence. In summary, experimental factors, uncontrolled across previous genome-wide yeast CLS studies, influence quiescence and interact extensively, revealing quiescence as a complex metabolic and developmental process that should be studied in a prototrophic context, omitting ammonium sulfate from defined media, and employing highly replicable protocols.",

    "abstract": "Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) of the betaproteobacterial genera Nitrosomonas and Nitrosospira are key nitrifying microorganisms in many natural and engineered ecosystems. Since many AOB remain uncultured, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes has been one of the most widely used approaches to study the community composition, abundance, and other features of AOB directly in environmental samples. However, the established and widely used AOB-specific 16S rRNA-targeted FISH probes were designed up to two decades ago, based on much smaller rRNA gene sequence datasets than available today. Several of these probes cover their target AOB lineages incompletely and suffer from a weak target specificity, which causes cross-hybridization of probes that should detect different AOB lineages. Here, a set of new highly specific 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes was developed and experimentally evaluated that complements the existing probes and enables the specific detection and differentiation of the known, major phylogenetic clusters of betaproteobacterial AOB. The new probes were successfully applied to visualize and quantify AOB in activated sludge and biofilm samples from seven pilot- and full-scale wastewater treatment systems. Based on its improved target group coverage and specificity, the refined probe set will facilitate future in situ analyses of AOB.",

To probe the pathogen-macrophage interface, we used proteomics to comprehensively quantify changes in post-translational modifications (PTMs) of host proteins during infection with three evolutionarily diverse intracellular pathogens: Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Listeria monocytogenes. Comparing global phosphorylation and ubiquitylation patterns identified extensive reprogramming of cellular pathways during infection, with ubiquitylation patterns revealing unique pathogen-specific molecular response signatures undetectable by transcriptional profiling. Differential PTM changes during infection with attenuated M. tuberculosis cells lacking the ESX-1 virulence determinant revealed extensive modification of phagosome dynamics and antiviral type I interferon activation. We found that M. tuberculosis-mediated activation of the antiviral OASL1-IRF7 pathway promotes bacterial replication, uncovering a new mechanism of virus-bacterial synergy.

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance is an increasing threat to human health. In the case of Aspergillus fumigatus, which is both an environmental saprobe and an opportunistic human fungal pathogen, resistance is suggested to arise from fungicide use in agriculture, as the azoles used for plant protection are almost identical to the frontline antifungals used clinically. However, limiting azole fungicide use on crop fields to preserve their activity for clinical use could threaten the global food supply via a reduction in yield. In this study we clarify the link between fungicide use on crop fields and resistance in a prototypical human pathogen through systematic soil sampling on farms in Germany and surveying fields before and after azole application. We observed a reduction in the abundance of A. fumigatus on fields following fungicide treatment in 2017--a finding that was not observed on an organic control field applying only natural plant protection agents. However, this finding was less pronounced during our 2018 sampling, indicating that the impact of fungicides on A. fumigatus population size is variable and influenced by additional factors. The overall resistance frequency among agricultural isolates is low, with only 1-3% of isolates from 2016-2018 displaying resistance to medical azoles. Isolates collected after the growing season and azole exposure show a subtle, but consistent decrease in susceptibility to medical and agricultural azoles. Whole genome sequencing indicates that, despite the alterations in antifungal susceptibility, fungicide application does not significantly affect the population structure and genetic diversity of A. fumigatus in fields. Given the low observed resistance rate among agricultural isolates, as well the lack of genomic impact following azole application, we do not find evidence that azole use on crops is significantly driving resistance in A. fumigatus in this context.\n\nIMPORTANCEAntibiotic resistance is an increasing threat to human health.

In this study we have compared the effect of mycobacteria infection on the level of metabolites in blood of humans and mice and whole zebrafish larvae using one highly standardized mass spectrometry pipeline, ensuring technical comparability of the results. Quantification of a range of circulating small amines showed that the levels of the majority of these compounds were significantly decreased in all three groups of infected organisms. Ten of these metabolites were common between the three different organisms comprising: methionine, asparagine, cysteine, threonine, serine, tryptophan, leucine, citrulline, ethanolamine and phenylalanine. The metabolomic changes of zebrafish larvae after infection were confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Our study identified common biomarkers for tuberculosis disease in humans, mice and zebrafish, showing across species conservation of metabolic reprogramming processes as a result of disease. Apparently, the mechanisms underlying these processes are independent of environmental, developmental and vertebrate evolutionary factors. The zebrafish larval model is highly suited to further investigate the mechanism of metabolic reprogramming and the connection with wasting syndrome due to infection by mycobacteria.",

Here we reveal that cittilins belong to the ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) family of natural products, for which only the crocagins have been reported from myxobacteria. A 27 amino acid precursor peptide harbors a C-terminal four amino acid core peptide, which is enzymatically modified and finally exported to yield cittilins. The small biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for cittilin biosynthesis also encodes a cytochrome P450 enzyme and a methyltransferase, whereas a gene encoding a prolyl endopeptidase for the cleavage of the precursor peptide is located outside of the cittilin biosynthetic gene cluster. We confirm the roles of the biosynthetic genes responsible for the formation of cittilins using targeted gene inactivation and heterologous expression in Streptomyces. We also report first steps towards the biochemical characterization of the proposed biosynthetic pathway in vitro. An investigation of the cellular uptake properties of cittilin A connected it to a potential biological function as an inhibitor of the prokaryotic carbon storage regulator A (CsrA).\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=108 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/114512v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (15K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11da6b5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1abc508org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14bb22org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@109cedd_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

However, its genome-wide distribution, correlation with gene expression, and dynamic changes during developmental processes are largely unknown. In this study, we find that histone Kcr is mainly distributed in active promoters, has a ge-nome-wide positive correlation with transcriptional activity, and regulates transcription of genes participating in metabolism and proliferation. Moreover, elevated histone Kcr activates bivalent promoters to stimulate gene expression in neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs), through increasing chromatin openness and recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II).

    "abstract": "Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is the costliest disease affecting the cattle industry globally. Despite decades of research, the pathophysiology of BRD is not yet fully understood. It is widely believed that viruses predispose cattle to bacterial infection by causing direct damage to the respiratory tract and interfering with the immune system, leading to bacterial pneumonia. BRD remains a major challenge despite extensive vaccination against all major viral pathogens associated with the disease. Orthomyxoviruses (Influenza C & D viruses), have recently been found to infect cattle throughout the United States and are implicated to play a role in BRD. Here, we use the largest cohort study to date to investigate the association of influenza viruses in cattle with BRD. Cattle (n=599) from 3 locations were individually observed and scored for respiratory symptoms using the McGuirk scoring system. Deep pharyngeal and mid-nasal swabs were collected from each animal and were tested quantitatively for bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine herpesvirus 1, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine coronavirus, influenza C virus (ICV) and influenza D virus (IDV) by real-time PCR. Cattle that have higher viral loads of IDV and ICV also have greater numbers of co-infecting viruses than controls. More strikingly, in BRD-symptomatic cattle, the geometric mean of detectable IDV viral RNA was nearly 2 logs higher in co-infected animals (1.30x104) than those singly infected with IDV (2.19x102). This is strong evidence that viral coinfections can lead to higher replication of IDV. Our results strongly suggest that orthomyxoviruses may be significant contributors to BRD.",

    "abstract": "Chronic immune inflammation (CII) is a characteristic symptom of HIV-1 infection that contributes to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) progression in infected patients. Distinct AIDS development rates have shown that there are Rapid Progressor (RP) and Long-Term Non-Progressor (LTNP) patients, but the circumstances governing these differences in disease progression are poorly understood. Mutations in the Viral Protein R (Vpr) have been suggested to have a direct impact on disease progression. Studies have shown that Vpr interacts with both host and viral factors; these interactions affect cellular activities such as cell cycle progression and enhancement of apoptosis. The Vpr mutants R36W and R77Q have been associated with RP and LTNP phenotypes, respectively; however, these findings are still controversial. This study sheds light on the effects that Vpr mutations have in the context of HIV-1 infection of the HUT78 T cell line, using replication-competent CXCR4-tropic virus strains. Our results show a replication enhancement of the R36W mutant (increased viral load and percentage of p24+ cells) accompanied by increased cytotoxicity. Interestingly, the R77Q mutant showed a unique enhancement of apoptosis (measured by Annexin V and TUNEL staining) and G2 cell cycle arrest; these effects were not seen with WT or R36W viruses. Since necrosis is associated with the release of pro-inflammatory factors, the R36 mutation could lead to more robust CII and the RP phenotype. Conversely, the R77Q mutation leads to apoptosis, potentially avoiding CII and leading to a LTNP phenotype. Thus, Vpr mutations may impact HIV-1 related progression to AIDS.\n\nImportanceThe vpr gene is thought to be an important virulence factor in Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1). vpr polymorphisms have been associated with different rates of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) progression. However, there is controversy about the cytopathic and virulence phenotypes of Vpr mutants, with contradictory conclusions about the same mutants. Here, we examine the replication capacity, apoptosis induction, and G2 cell cycle arrest phenotypes of three vpr mutants compared to wild-type HIV-1. One mutant associated with rapid AIDS progression replicated more efficiently and killed cells more rapidly than wild-type HIV-1. Another mutant associated with slow AIDS progression triggered apoptosis more efficiently than wild-type HIV-1. These results shed additional light on the role of vpr polymorphisms in T cell killing by HIV-1 and may help to explain the role of Vpr in different rates of AIDS progression.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiota shapes animal growth trajectory in stressful nutritional environments, but the molecular mechanisms behind such physiological benefits remain poorly understood. The gut microbiota is mostly composed of bacteria, which construct metabolic networks among themselves and with the host. Until now, how the metabolic activities of the microbiota contribute to host juvenile growth remains unknown. Here, using Drosophila as a host model, we report that two of its major bacterial partners, Lactobacillus plantarum and Acetobacter pomorum engage in a beneficial metabolic dialogue that boosts host juvenile growth despite nutritional stress. We pinpoint that lactate, produced by L. plantarum, is utilized by A. pomorum as an additional carbon source, and A. pomorum provides essential amino-acids and vitamins to L. plantarum. Such bacterial cross-feeding provisions a set of anabolic metabolites to the host, which may foster host systemic growth despite poor nutrition.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=165 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/119370v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1923739org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@679795org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@110cbecorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bc0804_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HIGHLIGHTSO_LIL. plantarum feeds lactate to A. pomorum\nC_LIO_LIA. pomorum supplies essential amino acids and vitamins to L. plantarum\nC_LIO_LIMicrobiota metabolic dialogue boosts Drosophilas larval growth\nC_LIO_LILactate utilization by Acetobacter releases anabolic metabolites to larvae\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV) is a large circular double-stranded DNA virus which has been used as a biological control agent to suppress Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros) in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Recently a new wave of O. rhinoceros incursions in Oceania in previously non-infested areas is thought to be related to the presence of low virulence isolates of OrNV or virus tolerant haplotypes of beetles. In this study, chronically infected O. rhinoceros adults were field collected from the Philippines, Fiji, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. We extracted total RNA from these samples to investigate the global viral gene expression profiles and comparative genomic analysis of structural variations between the four different populations. Maximum likelihood phylogenic analysis indicated that OrNV strains from the Solomon Islands and the Philippines are closely related to while OrNV strains from PNG and Fiji formed a distinct adjacent clade. We detected several polymorphic sites with a frequency higher than 35% in 892 positions of the viral genome. The highest number of structural variants, including single nucleotide variants (SNV), insertion, deletion and non-synonymous mutations, were found in strains from Fiji and PNG when compared to complete recently sequenced Solomon Islands OrNV reference genome. Non-synonymous mutations were detected in several hypothetical proteins, and 15 nudivirus core genes such as OrNV_gp034 (DNA Helicase), lef-8, lef-4 and vp91. For examination of the global gene expression profile of OrNV in chronically infected populations, we found limited evidence of variation between geographic populations. Only a few genes such as OrNV_gp01 (DNA polymerase B), OrNV_gp022 and OrNV_gp107 (Pif-3) were differentially expressed among different strains. Additionally, small RNA sequencing from the Solomon Islands population suggests that OrNV is targeted by the host RNA interference (RNAi) response with abundant 21nt small RNAs. Additionally, we identified a highly abundant putative 22 nt miRNA from the 3 of a pre-miRNA-like hairpin originating from OrNV-gp-098. These findings provide valuable resources for future studies to improve our understanding of the OrNV genetic variation. Some of these structural changes are specific to the geographic population and could be related to particular phenotypic characteristics of the strain, such as viral pathogenicity or transmissibility, and this requires further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Many photosynthetic organisms employ a CO2 concentrating mechanism (CCM) to increase the rate of CO2 fixation via the Calvin cycle. CCMs catalyze \u224850% of global photosynthesis, yet it remains unclear which genes and proteins are required to produce this complex adaptation. We describe the construction of a functional CCM in a non-native host, achieved by expressing genes from an autotrophic bacterium in an engineered E. coli strain. Expression of 20 CCM genes enabled E. coli to grow by fixing CO2 from ambient air into biomass, with growth depending on CCM components. Bacterial CCMs are therefore genetically compact and readily transplanted, rationalizing their presence in diverse bacteria. Reconstitution enabled genetic experiments refining our understanding of the CCM, thereby laying the groundwork for deeper study and engineering of the cell biology supporting CO2 assimilation in diverse organisms.One Sentence Summary A bacterial CO2 concentrating mechanism enables E. coli to fix CO2 from ambient air.Competing Interest StatementD.F.S. is a co-founder of Scribe Therapeutics and a scientific advisory board member of Scribe Therapeutics and Mammoth Biosciences.
