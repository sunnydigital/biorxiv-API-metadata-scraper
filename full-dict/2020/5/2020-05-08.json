    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is often considered the precursor of Alzheimers disease. However, MCI is associated with substantially variable progression rates, which are not well understood. Attempts to identify the mechanisms that underlie MCI progression have often focused on the hippocampus, but have mostly overlooked its intricate structure and subdivisions. Here, we utilized deep learning to delineate the contribution of hippocampal subfields to MCI progression using a total sample of 1157 subjects (349 in the training set, 427 in a validation set and 381 in the testing set). We propose a dense convolutional neural network architecture that differentiates stable and progressive MCI based on hippocampal morphometry. The proposed deep learning model predicted MCI progression with an accuracy of 75.85%. A novel implementation of occlusion analysis revealed marked differences in the contribution of hippocampal subfields to the performance of the model, with presubiculum, CA1, subiculum, and molecular layer showing the most central role. Moreover, the analysis reveals that 10.5% of the volume of the hippocampus was redundant in the differentiation between stable and progressive MCI. Our predictive model uncovers pronounced differences in the contribution of hippocampal subfields to the progression of MCI. The results may reflect the sparing of hippocampal structure in individuals with a slower progression of neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Gene transfer agents (GTAs) are virus-like elements integrated into bacterial genomes, particularly, those of Alphaproteobacteria. The GTAs can be induced under nutritional stress, incorporate random fragments of bacterial DNA into mini-phage particles, lyse the host cells and infect neighboring bacteria, thus enhancing horizontal gene transfer. We show that the GTA genes evolve under pronounced positive selection for the reduction of the energy cost of protein production as shown by comparison of the amino acid compositions with both homologous viral genes and host genes. The energy saving in GTA genes is comparable to or even more pronounced than that in the genes encoding the most abundant, essential bacterial proteins. In cases when viruses acquire genes from GTAs, the bias in amino acid composition disappears in the course of evolution, showing that reduction of the energy cost of protein is an important factor of evolution of GTAs but not bacterial viruses. These findings strongly suggest that GTAs are bacterial adaptations rather than selfish, virus-like elements. Because GTA production kills the host cell and does not propagate the GTA genome, it appears likely that the GTAs are retained in the course of evolution via kin or group selection. Therefore, we hypothesize that GTA facilitate the survival of bacterial populations under energy-limiting conditions through the spread of metabolic and transport capabilities via horizontal gene transfer and increase of nutrient availability resulting from the altruistic suicide of GTA-producing cells.\n\nImportanceKin and group selection remain controversial topics in evolutionary biology. We argue that these types of selection are likely to operate in bacterial populations by showing that bacterial Gene Transfer Agents (GTAs), but not related viruses, evolve under positive selection for the reduction of the energy cost of a GTA particle production. We hypothesize that GTAs are dedicated devices for the survival of bacteria under the conditions of nutrient limitation. The benefits conferred by GTAs under nutritional stress appear to include horizontal dissemination of genes that could provide bacteria with enhanced capabilities for nutrient utilization and the increase of nutrient availability through the lysis of GTA-producing bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Large spines are stable and important for memory trace formation. The majority of large spines also contains Synaptopodin (SP), an actin-modulating and plasticity-related protein. Since SP stabilizes F-actin, we speculated that the presence of SP within large spines could explain their long lifetime. Indeed, using time-lapse 2-photon-imaging of SP-transgenic granule cells in mouse organotypic tissue cultures we found that spines containing SP survived considerably longer than spines of equal size without SP. Of note, SP-positive spines that underwent pruning first lost SP before disappearing. Whereas the survival time courses of SP-positive (SP+) spines followed conditional two-phase decay functions, SP-negative (SP-) spines and all spines of SP-deficient animals showed single exponential decays. These results implicate SP as a major regulator of long-term spine stability: SP clusters stabilize spines and the presence of SP indicates spines of high stability.",

    "abstract": "We present a full-likelihood method to estimate and quantify polygenic adaptation from contemporary DNA sequence data. The method combines population genetic DNA sequence data and GWAS summary statistics from up to thousands of nucleotide sites in a joint likelihood function to estimate the strength of transient directional selection acting on a polygenic trait. Through population genetic simulations of polygenic trait architectures and GWAS, we show that the method substantially improves power over current methods. We examine the robustness of the method under uncorrected GWAS stratification, uncertainty and ascertainment bias in the GWAS estimates of SNP effects, uncertainty in the identification of causal SNPs, allelic heterogeneity, negative selection, and low GWAS sample size. The method can quantify selection acting on correlated traits, fully controlling for pleiotropy even among traits with strong genetic correlation (|rg| = 80%; c.f. schizophrenia and bipolar disorder) while retaining high power to attribute selection to the causal trait. We apply the method to study 56 human polygenic traits for signs of recent adaptation. We find signals of directional selection on pigmentation (tanning, sunburn, hair, P=5.5e-15, 1.1e-11, 2.2e-6, respectively), life history traits (age at first birth, EduYears, P=2.5e-4, 2.6e-4, respectively), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c, P=1.2e-3), bone mineral density (P=1.1e-3), and neuroticism (P=5.5e-3). We also conduct joint testing of 137 pairs of genetically correlated traits. We find evidence of widespread correlated response acting on these traits (2.6-fold enrichment over the null expectation, P=1.5e-7). We find that for several traits previously reported as adaptive, such as educational attainment and hair color, a significant proportion of the signal of selection on these traits can be attributed to correlated response, vs direct selection (P=2.9e-6, 1.7e-4, respectively). Lastly, our joint test uncovers antagonistic selection that has acted to increase type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk and decrease HbA1c (P=1.5e-5).",

    "abstract": "N-linked glycans commonly contribute to secretory protein folding, sorting and signaling. For enveloped viruses such as the influenza A virus (IAV), the addition of large N-linked glycans can also prevent access to epitopes on the surface antigens hemagglutinin (HA or H) and neuraminidase (NA or N). Sequence analysis showed that in the NA head domain of H1N1 IAVs three N-linked glycosylation sites are conserved and that a fourth site is conserved in H3N2 IAVs. Variable sites are almost exclusive to H1N1 IAVs of human origin, where the number of head glycosylation sites first increased and then decreased over time. In contrast, variable sites exist in H3N2 IAVs of human and swine origin, where the number of head glycosylation sites has mainly increased over time. Analysis of IAVs carrying N1 and N2 mutants demonstrated that the N-linked glycosylation sites on the NA head domain are required for efficient virion incorporation and replication in cells or eggs. It also revealed that N1 stability is more affected by the head domain glycans, suggesting N2 is more amenable to glycan additions. Together, these results indicate that in addition to antigenicity, N-linked glycosylation sites can alter NA enzymatic stability and the NA amount in virions.",

    "abstract": "Plants detect proximity of competitors through reduction in the ratio between red and far red light triggering the shade avoidance syndrome, which includes accelerated shoot elongation and early flowering. Shade avoidance is regulated through PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORs (PIFs), a group of bHLH transcription factors. Another (b)HLH protein, KIDARI (KDR), which is non-DNA-binding, was identified in de-etiolation studies and proposed to interact with LONG HYPOCOTYL IN FAR-RED 1 (HFR1), a (b)HLH protein that inhibits shade avoidance. Here we establish novel roles of KDR in regulating shade avoidance and investigate how KDR regulates the shade avoidance network. We show that KDR is a positive regulator of shade avoidance and interacts with several negative growth regulators. We identify novel interactors using a combination of yeast two-hybrid screening and dedicated confirmations with bimolecular fluorescence complementation. We demonstrate that KDR is translocated primarily to the nucleus when coexpressed with these newly discovered interactors. A genetic approach confirmed that several of these novel interactions are indeed functional to shade avoidance in Arabidopsis thaliana, whereas we propose that KDR does not interact with HFR1 to regulate shade avoidance. Based on this, we propose that shade avoidance is regulated by a three-layered gas-and-brake mechanism of bHLH protein interactions, adding an additional layer of complexity to what was previously known.\n\nOne-sentence summaryKIDARI is a positive regulator of shade avoidance and part of a three-layer network of bHLH transcription factor interactions.",

Although Cep135 has been associated to centriolar assembly, the mechanisms associated to the pathogenesis underlying MCPH8 mutations are unclear. By using a series of CRISPR/Cas9-edited murine Cep135 alleles, we report here that lack of Cep135 results in perinatal lethality accompanied by significant microcephaly in a dosis-dependent manner. Cep135 deficiency, but not that of other centrosomal microcephaly proteins such as Aspm or Cdk5rap2, induces centrosome duplication defects, and perturbed centriole structure and dynamics. Whereas other cell types are able to quickly adapt to these defects, neural progenitors display a prolonged response leading to chromosomal instability and cell death in later developmental stages. Genetic ablation of Trp53 in these mutant embryos prevents apoptotic cell death but does not rescue the microcephaly induced by Cep135 loss. These results suggest that microcephaly can arise from the lack of adaptation to centriole defects in neural progenitors of the developing neocortex in a p53-independent manner.",

    "abstract": "Bacillus thuringiensis is the most used biopesticide in agriculture. Its entomopathogenic capacity stems from the possession of plasmid-borne insecticidal crystal genes (cry), traditionally used as discriminant taxonomic feature for that species. As such, crystal and plasmid identification are key to the characterization of this species. To date, about 600 B. thuringiensis genomes have been reported, but less than 5% have been resolved, while the other draft genomes are incomplete, precluding plasmid delineation. Here we present the complete genome of Bacillus thuringiensis HER1410, a strain closely related to B. thuringiensis entomocidus and a known host for a variety of Bacillus phages. The combination of short and long-reads techniques allowed fully resolving the genome and delineation of three plasmids. This enabled the accurate detection of an unusual location of a unique cry gene, cry1Ba4, located in a genomic island near the chromosome replication origin. Two megaplasmids, pLUSID1 and pLUSID2 could be delineated: pLUSID1 (368kb), a likely conjugative plasmid involved in virulence, and pLUSID2 potentially related to the sporulation process. A smaller plasmidial prophage pLUSID3, with a dual lifestyle whose integration within the chromosome, causes the disruption of a flagellar key component. Finally, phylogenetic analysis located this strain within a clade comprising members from the B. thuringiensis serovar thuringiensis and other serovars and with B.cereus s. s. This highlights the intermingled taxonomy of B. cereus sensu lato group, where genomics alone does not support the present taxonomy between B. cereus s. s. and B. thuringiensis as species designation currently relies solely on the presence of entomocidal genes.\n\nImportanceBacillus cereus group species have been extensively studied due to their economical and clinical relevance. This importance originally set the basis for B. cereus group members classification which are commonly based on phenotypical criteria. Sequencing era has shed light about genomic characterization of these species, showing their chromosomal genomic similarity and highlighting the role of mobile genetic elements, especially megaplasmids, in the classification and characterization of this group. However, only the 5% of the sequenced B. thuringiensis genomes have been fully resolved. Thus, here we addressed efficiently the study B. thuringiensis HER1410 genomic features by the use of a combination of short and long-reads sequencing. This methodology resulted in the high-quality assembly, which led to the identification of an uncommon location of a cry gene close to the chromosomal origin, as well as three fully resolved extrachromosomal elements, two megaplasmids and an integrative plasmidial prophage.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAn emm-cluster based system was proposed as a standard typing scheme to facilitate and enhance future studies of Group A Streptococcus (Strep A) epidemiological surveillance, M protein function and vaccine development strategies. We provide an evidence-based distribution of Strep A emm clusters in Africa and assess the potential coverage of the new 30-valent vaccine in terms of an emm cluster-based approach.\n\nMethodTwo reviewers independently assessed studies retrieved from a comprehensive search and extracted relevant data. Meta-analyses were performed (random effects model) to aggregate emm cluster prevalence estimates.\n\nResultsEight studies (n=1,595 isolates) revealed the predominant emm clusters as E6 (18%, 95% confidence interval (CI), 12.6; 24.0%), followed by E3 (14%, 95%CI, 11.2; 17.4%) and E4 (13%, 95%CI, 9.5; 16.0%). There is negligible variation in emm clusters as regards regions, age and socio-economic status across the continent. Considering an emm cluster-based vaccine strategy, which assumes cross-protection within clusters, the 30-valent vaccine currently in clinical development, would provide hypothetical coverage to 80.3% of isolates in Africa.\n\nConclusionThis systematic review indicates the most predominant Strep A emm cluster in Africa is E6 followed by E3, E4 and D4. The current 30-valent vaccine would provide considerable coverage across the diversity of emm cluster types in Africa. Future efforts could be directed toward estimating the overall potential coverage of the new 30-valent vaccine based on cross-opsonization studies with representative panels of Strep A isolates from populations at highest risk for Strep A diseases.\n\nImportanceLow vaccine coverage is of grave public health concern, particularly in developing countries where epidemiological data are often absent. To inform vaccine development for group A streptococcus (Strep A), we report on the epidemiology of the M Protein emm clusters from Strep A infections in Africa, where Strep A-related illnesses and their sequalae including rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, are of a high burden. This first report of emm clusters across the continent indicate a high probably of coverage by the M Protein-based vaccine currently undergoing testing, were an emm-cluster based approach to be used.",

    "abstract": "Compelling evidence suggests the need for more data per individual to reliably map the functional organization of the human connectome. As the notion that  more data is better emerges as a golden rule for functional connectomics, researchers find themselves grappling with the challenges of how to obtain the desired amounts of data per participant in a practical manner, particularly for retrospective data aggregation. Increasingly, the aggregation of data across all fMRI scans available for an individual is being viewed as a solution, regardless of scan condition (e.g., rest, task, movie). A number of open questions exist regarding the aggregation process and the impact of different decisions on the reliability of resultant aggregate data. We leveraged the availability of highly sampled test-retest datasets to systematically examine the impact of data aggregation strategies on the reliability of cortical functional connectomics. Specifically, we compared functional connectivity estimates derived after concatenating from: 1) multiple scans under the same state, 2) multiple scans under different states (i.e. hybrid or general functional connectivity), and 3) subsets of one long scan. We also varied connectivity processing (i.e. global signal regression, ICA-FIX, and task regression) and estimation procedures. When the total number of time points is equal, and the scan state held constant, concatenating multiple shorter scans had a clear advantage over a single long scan. However, this was not necessarily true when concatenating across different fMRI states (i.e. task conditions), where the reliability from the aggregate data varied across states. Concatenating fewer numbers of states that are more reliable tends to yield higher reliability. Our findings provide an overview of multiple dependencies of data concatenation that should be considered to optimize reliability in analysis of functional connectivity data.",

    "abstract": "The permeability of roots to water and nutrients is controlled through a variety of mechanisms and one of the most conspicuous is the presence of structures such as the Casparian strips and suberin lamellae. Roots actively regulate the creation of these structures developmentally, along the length of the root, and in response to the environment, including abiotic stresses such as drought. In the current study, we characterized the suberin composition along the length of grapevine fine roots during development and in response to water deficit. In parallel samples we quantified changes in expression of suberin biosynthesis- and deposition-related gene families (via RNAseq) allowing the identification of drought-responsive suberin-related genes. Grapevine suberin composition did not differ between primary and lateral roots, and was similar to that of other species. Under water deficit there was a global upregulation of suberin biosynthesis which resulted in an increase of suberin specific monomers, but without changes in their relative abundances, and this upregulation took place across all the developmental stages of fine roots. These changes corresponded to the upregulation of numerous suberin biosynthesis- and deposition-related genes which included orthologs of the previously characterized AtMYB41 transcriptional factor. Functional validation of two grapevine MYB41 orthologs, VviMYB41 and VviMYB41-like, confirmed their ability to globally upregulate suberin biosynthesis and deposition. This study provides a detailed characterization of the developmental and water deficit induced suberization of grapevine fine roots and identifies important orthologs responsible for suberin biosynthesis, deposition, and its regulation in grape.\n\nOne sentence summaryOur study details the biochemical changes and molecular regulation of how grapevines decrease their root permeability during drought.",

    "abstract": "The gastrointestinal pathogen Vibrio cholerae frequently forms biofilms during its life cycle. Biofilm formation is vital for protection against environmental stresses and is thought to facilitate intestinal colonization. Adaptation to temperature is crucial for V. cholerae survival, as the pathogen is exposed to seasonal temperature variations in the aquatic environment, and temperature fluctuations during host-environment transitions. Here, we show that V. cholerae strains naturally lacking the master biofilm transcriptional regulator HapR are unable to develop colony rugosity at low temperatures. We find that BipA, a ribosome-associated GTPase, accounts for this temperature-dependent control of biofilm formation by repressing translation of the primary biofilm transcriptional activators VpsR and VpsT at low temperatures. In vitro studies demonstrate that low temperatures influence BipA structural conformation and decrease its sensitivity to proteolysis. Proteomic analyses reveal that BipA exerts temperature-dependent control over >200 proteins in V. cholerae involved in a multitude of cell processes, including biofilm assembly. Our study reveals a remarkable new facet of the complex V. cholerae biofilm regulatory cascade and suggests that combined transcriptional-translational control could be a common mechanism by which bacteria adapt to environmental flux.",

    "abstract": "In mouse oocytes, acentriolar MTOCs functionally replace centrosomes and act as microtubule nucleation sites. Microtubules nucleated from MTOCs initially assemble into an unorganized ball-like structure, which then transforms into a bipolar spindle carrying MTOCs at its poles, a process called spindle bipolarization. In mouse oocytes, spindle bipolarization is promoted by kinetochores but the mechanism by which kinetochore-microtubule attachments contribute to spindle bipolarity remains unclear. This study demonstrates that the stability of kinetochore-microtubule attachment is essential for confining MTOC positions at the spindle poles and for limiting spindle elongation. MTOC sorting is gradual and continues even in the metaphase spindle. When stable kinetochore-microtubule attachments are disrupted, the spindle is unable to restrict MTOCs at its poles and fails to terminate its elongation. Stable kinetochore fibers are directly connected to MTOCs and to the spindle poles, and thus may serve as a measure that defines proper spindle length. These findings reinforce the hypothesis that kinetochores act as scaffolds for acentrosomal spindle bipolarity.",

    "abstract": "Bone infections following open bone fracture or implant surgery remain a challenge in the orthopedics field. In order to avoid high doses of systemic drug administration, optimized local antibiotic release from scaffolds is required. 3D additive manufactured (AM) scaffolds made with biodegradable polymers are ideal to support bone healing in non-union scenarios and can be given antimicrobial properties by the incorporation of antibiotics. In this study, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin intercalated in the interlamellar spaces of magnesium aluminum layered double hydroxides (MgAl) and -zirconium phosphates (ZrP), respectively, are dispersed within a thermoplastic polymer by melt compounding and subsequently processed via high temperature melt extrusion AM ([~]190 {degrees}C) into 3D scaffolds. The inorganic fillers enable a sustained antibiotics release through the polymer matrix, controlled by antibiotics counterions exchange or pH conditions. Importantly, both antibiotics retain their functionality after the manufacturing process at high temperatures, as verified by their activity against both Gram + and Gram - bacterial strains. Moreover, scaffolds loaded with filler-antibiotic do not impair human mesenchymal stromal cells osteogenic differentiation, allowing matrix mineralization and the expression of relevant osteogenic markers. Overall, these results suggest the possibility of fabricating dual functionality 3D scaffolds via high temperature melt extrusion for bone regeneration and infection prevention.",

However, how persistent viral infectious challenge and ensuing inflammatory responses target BM tissues and perturb hematopoietic homeostasis remains poorly understood. Here, we combine extensive functional analyses with advanced 3D microscopy to demonstrate that chronic infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus clone 13 results in the long-term impairment of HSC function, concomitant with a persistent destruction of the HSC-supportive stromal networks of mesenchymal CXCL12-abundant reticular cells. During infections, long lasting injuries and aberrant transcriptional programs of the stromal infrastructure diminish the capacity of the BM microenvironment to adequately support HSC maintenance. Mechanistically, BM immunopathology is elicited by virus-specific, activated CD8 T cells, which accumulate in the BM via interferon-dependent mechanisms. Combined inhibition of type I and II IFN pathways completely preempts viral-mediated degeneration of CARc networks and protects HSCs from persistent dysfunction. Hence, viral infections and ensuing immune reactions chronically interfere with BM function by disrupting essential stromal-derived, hematopoietic-supporting cues.",

Our approaches leverage the flexibility provided by the nimble R package.

In our second example, we reduce the computing time required to generate 10,000 posterior samples from 4.5 hours down to five minutes, and realize an increase in MCMC efficiency by a factor of 25.

    "abstract": "Mycorrhizal fungi are critical components of terrestrial habitats and agroecosystems. Recently, Mucoromycotina fine root endophyte (MucFRE) fungi were found to engage in nutritional mutualism with the rare plant Lycopodiella inundata ( marsh clubmoss), one of the earliest vascular plant lineages known to associate with MucFRE. The extent to which this mutualism plays a role in resilient plant populations can only be understood by examining its occurrence rate and phenological patterns.\n\nTo test for prevalence and seasonality in colonization, we examined 1,297 individual L. inundata roots collected during spring and autumn 2019 from 11 semi-natural heathlands in Britain and the Netherlands. We quantified presence/absence of MucFRE-like hyphae and vesicles and explored possible relationships between temperature and precipitation in the months immediately before sampling.\n\nMucFRE-like hyphae were the dominant mycorrhizal fungi observed in all of the examined heathlands. However, we found significant differences in colonization between the two seasons at every site. Overall, 14% of L. inundata roots were colonised in spring (2.4% with vesicles) compared with 86% in autumn (7.6% with vesicles). Colonization levels between populations were also significantly different, and correlated with temperature and precipitation, suggesting some local environments may be more conducive to hyphal growth.\n\nThese marked seasonal differences in host-plant colonization suggest that results about mycorrhizal status - typically drawn from single time point collections - should be carefully interpreted. Our findings are directly relevant to habitat restoration, species conservation plans, agricultural bio-inoculation nutrient enhancement treatments, microbial diversity and functional studies of host plants and symbionts.",

    "abstract": "The discovery that disordered proteins are widespread in the human proteome has prompted the quest for methods to characterize the conformational properties that determine their functional and dysfunctional behaviour. It has become customary to describe these proteins in terms of structural ensembles and free energy landscapes, which offer conformational and thermodynamic insight. However, a current major challenge is to generalize this description to  kinetic ensembles, thereby also providing information on transition rates between states. Approaches based on the theory of stochastic processes can be particularly suitable for this purpose. Here, we develop a Markov state model and illustrate its application by determining a kinetic ensemble of the 42-residue form of the amyloid-{beta} peptide (A{beta}42), whose aggregation is associated with Alzheimers disease. Using the Google Compute Engine, we generated 315 s all-atom, explicit solvent molecular dynamics trajectories, validated with experimental data from nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Using a probabilistic-based definition of conformational states in a neural network approach, we found that A{beta}42 is characterized by inter-state transitions no longer than the microsecond timescale, exhibiting only fully unfolded or short-lived, partially-folded states. We contextualize our findings by performing additional simulations of the oxidized form of A{beta}42. Our results illustrate how the use of kinetic ensembles offers an effective means to provide information about the structure, thermodynamics, and kinetics of disordered proteins towards an understanding of these ubiquitous biomolecules.",

We therefore hypothesized that a whitening of BAT occurs in obesity and assessed the molecular characteristics of deep neck BAT in a cohort of 24 normal weight, 24 overweight and 22 obese individuals in comparison with subcutaneous abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT). We found that the major marker of BAT thermogenesis, UCP1, was associated with central but not general obesity. We performed transcriptomic analysis of BAT in a cohort of 27 individuals classified as normal weight, over-weight or obese, and additionally four subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), dispersed among the 3 BMI groups. We identified 3204 differentially expressed genes between BAT and WAT in samples from normal weight individuals, including genes involved in thermogenesis, but also revealing differences in developmental and immune system related genes. In BAT from individuals with overweight or obesity, 202 genes were downregulated and 66 of these were involved in cellular respiratory pathways, likely reflecting previously observed reduction in thermogenic function with obesity. Importantly, most BAT selective genes were not affected, and isolated adipose progenitors differentiated into thermogenic adipocytes with equal frequency regardless of BMI group. In conclusion, our data suggest a retained BAT identity, with a selective reduction of thermogenic genes, in human obesity.",

Our approach accounts for platform effects introduced by systematic technical variability inherent to different sequencing modalities.

We further show the advantages of RCTD by its ability to detect mixtures and identify cell types on an assessment dataset. Finally, we show how RCTDs recovery of cell type localization uniquely enables the discovery of genes within a cell type whose expression depends on spatial environment. Spatial mapping of cell types with RCTD has the potential to enable the definition of spatial components of cellular identity, uncovering new principles of cellular organization in biological tissue.",

Here, we improve this powerful method, especially by optimizing the proteolytic digestion (type of reducing agent, its concentration, and incubation time), to work with complex mixtures, specifically a lysate of the rough mitochondrial fraction from yeast. The advantages of this hyphenated method compared to column-based or separate analyses are (i) rapid and direct visual readout from the SPRi array, (ii) possibility of high-throughput analysis of different interactions in parallel, (iii) high sensitivity, and (iv) no sample loss or contamination due to elution or micro-recovery procedures. The model system used is a catalytically active RNA (group IIB intron from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Sc.ai5{gamma}) and its cofactor Mss116. The protein supports the RNA folding process and thereby the subsequent excision of the intronic RNA from the coding part. Using the novel approach of coupling SPR with MALDI MS, we report the identification of potential RNA-binding proteins from a crude yeast mitochondrial lysate in a non-targeted approach. Our results show that proteins other than the well-known cofactor Mss116 interact with Sc.ai5{gamma} (Dbp8, Prp8, Mrp13, and Cullin-3), suggesting that the intron folding and splicing are regulated by more than one cofactor in vivo.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=141 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/082776v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@50a09borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1602253org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6d9cc7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4ff0f0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Author contributionUlrike Anders and Maya Gulotti-Georgieva contributed equally to this work.",

However, due to the difficulty of estimating the trajectories of the U-shape fibres from diffusion MRI, the short structural connectivity of this sulcus remains relatively unknown. In this context, we studied the spatial organization of these U-shape fibres along the central sulcus. Based on high quality diffusion MRI data of 100 right-handed subjects and state-of-the-art pre-processing pipeline, we first define a connectivity space that provide a comprehensive and continuous description of the short-range anatomical connectivity around the central sulcus at both the individual and group levels. We then infer the presence of five major U-shape fibre bundles at the group level in both hemispheres by applying unsupervised clustering in the connectivity space. We propose a quantitative investigation of their position and number of streamlines as a function of phenotypic traits such as sex and hemispheres and functional scores such as handedness and manual dexterity. Main findings of this study are twofold: a description of U-shape short-range connectivity along the central sulcus at group level and the evidence of a significant relationship between the position of three hand related U-shape fibre bundles and the handedness score of subjects.",

    "abstract": "Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing is an enzymatic post-transcriptional modification which modulates immunity and neural transmission in multicellular organisms. Some of its functions are enforced through editing of mRNA codons with the resulting amino acid substitutions. We identified these sites originated from the RNA editing for developmental proteomes of Drosophila melanogaster at the protein level using available proteomic data for fifteen stages of fruit fly development from egg to imago and fourteen time points of embryogenesis. In total, 42 sites each belonging to a unique protein were found including four sites related to embryogenesis. The interactome analysis has revealed that most of the edited proteins are associated with synaptic vesicle trafficking and actomyosin organization. Quantitation data analysis suggested the existence of phase-specific RNA editing regulation by yet unknown mechanisms. These results support transcriptome analyses showing that a burst in RNA editing occurs during insect metamorphosis from pupa to imago. Further, targeted proteomics was employed to quantify edited and genomically encoded versions of five proteins in brains of larvae, pupae, and imago insects showing a clear trend towards an increase in editing rate for all of them. Our results may help to reveal the protein functions in physiological effects of RNA editing.\n\nSignificanceAdenosine-to-inosine RNA editing has multiple effects on body functions in many multicellular organisms from insects and molluscs to humans. Recent studies show that at least some of these effects are mediated by changes in protein sequences due to editing of codons in mRNA. However, it is not known how exactly the edited proteins can participate in RNA editing-mediated pathways. Moreover, most studies of edited proteins are based on the deduction of protein sequence changes from analysis of transcriptome without measurements of proteins themselves. Earlier, we explored for the first time the edited proteins of Drosophila melanogaster proteome. In this work, we continued the proteome-wide analysis of RNA editome using shotgun proteomic data of ontogeny phases of this model insect. It was found that non-synonymous RNA editing, which led to translation of changed proteins, is specific to the life cycle phase. Identification of tryptic peptides containing edited protein sites provides a basis for further direct and quantitative analysis of their editing rate by targeted proteomics. The latter was demonstrated in this study by multiple reaction monitoring experiments which were used to observe the dynamics of editing in selected brain proteins during developmental phases of fruit fly.\n\nHighlightsO_LIProteogenomic approach was applied to shotgun proteomics data of fruit fly ontogeny for identification of proteoforms originating from adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing.\nC_LIO_LIEdited proteins identified at all life cycle stages are enriched in annotated protein-protein interactions at statistically significant level with many of them associated with actomyosin and synaptic vesicle functions.\nC_LIO_LIProteome-wide RNA editing event profiles were found specific to life cycle phase and independent of the protein abundances.\nC_LIO_LIA majority of RNA editing events at the protein level was observed after metamorphosis in late pupae to adult insects, which was consistent with transcriptome data.\nC_LIO_LITargeted proteomic analysis of five selected edited sites and their genomic counterparts in brains for three phases of the fruit fly life cycle have demonstrated a clear increase in editing rate of up to 80% for the endophilin A protein in adult flies.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D:4D) has been associated with sexual dimorphism, with a lower 2D:4D in males. A large body of research has relied on the 2D:4D as a proxy for prenatal androgen exposure, and includes reports of relationships between 2D:4D and a wide range of human traits. Here, we examine the validity of the 2D:4D proxy by studying the association between 2D:4D and classical Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, a condition characterized by excessive prenatal exposure to androgens during most of the gestational period. To this end, we retrospectively examine 513 serial radiographs of the left hand obtained clinically in 90 youth with classical CAH (45 female) and 70 control youth (31 female). Replicating previous reports, we observe associations of the 2D:4D with sex (lower 2D:4D in males) and age (increase of 2D:4D through development). However, we find no evidence for differences in 2D:4D between CAH and controls (full sample: {square} = -0.001 (-0.008, 0.006)]; females: {square} = -0.004 [-0.015, 0.007]; males: {square} = 0.001, [-0.008, 0.011]). Although our findings do not rule out a small association between the 2D:4D and CAH, they cast doubt on the usefulness of the 2D:4D as a biomarker for prenatal androgen exposure in behavioral research.",

Here, we decode the compact 73.8 Mb genome of Dimorphilus gyrociliatus, a meiobenthic segmented worm. The D. gyrociliatus genome retains traits classically associated with larger and slower-evolving genomes, such as an ordered, intact Hox cluster, a generally conserved developmental toolkit, and traces of ancestral bilaterian linkage. Unlike some other animals with small genomes, the analysis of the D. gyrociliatus epigenome revealed canonical features of genome regulation, excluding the presence of operons and trans-splicing. Instead, the gene dense D. gyrociliatus genome presents a divergent Myc pathway, a key physiological regulator of growth, proliferation, and genome stability in animals. Altogether, our results uncover a conservative route to genome compaction in annelids, reminiscent of that observed in the vertebrate Takifugu rubripes.",

What remains unclear is how strongly network design choices, such as architecture, task training, and subsequent fitting to brain data contribute to the observed similarities. Here we compare a diverse set of nine DNN architectures on their ability to explain the representational geometry of 62 isolated object images in human inferior temporal (hIT) cortex, as measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging. We compare untrained networks to their task-trained counterparts, and assess the effect of fitting them to hIT using a cross-validation procedure. To best explain hIT, we fit a weighted combination of the principal components of the features within each layer, and subsequently a weighted combination of layers. We test all models across all stages of training and fitting for their correlation with the hIT representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM) using an independent set of images and subjects. We find that trained models significantly outperform untrained models (accounting for 57% more of the explainable variance), suggesting that features representing natural images are important for explaining hIT. Model fitting further improves the alignment of DNN and hIT representations (by 124%), suggesting that the relative prevalence of different features in hIT does not readily emerge from the particular ImageNet object-recognition task used to train the networks. Finally, all DNN architectures tested achieved equivalent high performance once trained and fitted. Similar ability to explain hIT representations appears to be shared among deep feedforward hierarchies of nonlinear features with spatially restricted receptive fields.",

However, by carefully monitoring peptide digestion with liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, we observed synthesis of novel peptides during cathepsin B incubations. This ligation activity was explored further with a variety of peptide substrates to establish mechanistic details and was found to operate through a two-step mechanism with proteolysis and ligation occurring separately. Further explorations using varied sequences indicated increased affinity for some substrates, though all were found to ligate to some extent. Finally, experiments with a proteolytically inactive form of the enzyme yielded no ligation, indicating that the ligation reaction occurs in the same active site but in the reverse direction of proteolysis. These results clearly establish that cathepsin B can act as both a protease and ligase, although protease action eventually dominates over longer periods of time.",

    "abstract": "A variety of cat breeds have been developed via novelty selection on aesthetic, dermatological traits, such as coat colors and fur types. A recently developed breed, the lykoi, was bred from cats with a sparse hair coat with roaning, implying full color and all white hairs. The lykoi phenotype is a form of hypotrichia, presenting as significant reduction in the average numbers of follicles per hair follicle group as compared to domestic shorthair cats, a mild to severe perifollicular to mural lymphocytic infiltration in 77% of observed hair follicle groups, and the follicles are often miniaturized, dilated, and dysplastic. Whole genome sequencing was conducted on a single lykoi cat that was a cross between two independently ascertained lineages. Comparison to the 99 Lives dataset of 194 non-lykoi cats suggested two variants in the cat homolog for Hairless (HR: lysine demethylase and nuclear receptor corepressor) as candidate causal variants. The lykoi cat was a compound heterozygote for two loss of function variants in HR, an exon 3 c.1255_1256dupGT (chrB1:36040783), which should produce a stop codon at amino acid 420 (p.Gln420Serfs*100) and, an exon 18 c.3389insGACA (chrB1:36051555), which should produce a stop codon at amino acid position 1130 (p.Ser1130Argfs*29). Ascertainment of 14 additional cats from founder lineages from Canada, France and different areas of the USA identified four additional loss of function HR variants likely causing the highly similar phenotypic hair coat across the diverse cats. The novel variants in HR for cat hypotrichia can now be established between minor differences in the phenotypic presentations.",

    "abstract": "When ribosomes fail to complete normal translation, all cells have mechanisms to ensure degradation of the resulting partial proteins to safeguard proteome integrity. In E. coli and other eubacteria, the tmRNA system rescues stalled ribosomes and adds an ssrA tag or degron to the C-terminus of the incomplete protein, which directs degradation by the AAA+ ClpXP protease. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of ClpXP bound to the ssrA degron. C-terminal residues of the ssrA degron initially bind in the top of an otherwise closed ClpX axial channel and subsequently move deeper into an open channel. For short-degron protein substrates, we show that unfolding can occur directly from the initial closed-channel complex. For longer-degron substrates, our studies illuminate how ClpXP transitions from specific recognition into a nonspecific unfolding and translocation machine. Many AAA+ proteases and protein-remodeling motors are likely to employ similar multistep recognition and engagement strategies.",

    "abstract": "Despite the established role of mitochondria in tumorigenesis, the molecular mechanisms by which mitochondrial Ca2+ (mtCa2+) signaling regulates tumor growth and metastasis remain unknown. The crucial role of mtCa2+ in tumorigenesis is highlighted by the altered expression of proteins mediating mtCa2+ uptake and extrusion in cancer cells. Here, we demonstrate that expression of the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger NCLX (SLC8B1) is decreased in colorectal tumors and is associated with advanced-stage disease in patients. We reveal that downregulation of NCLX leads to mtCa2+ overload, mitochondrial depolarization, mitophagy, and reduced tumor size. Concomitantly, NCLX downregulation drives metastatic spread, chemoresistance, the expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), hypoxia, and stem cell pathways. Mechanistically, mtCa2+ overload leads to an increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) which activates HIF1 signaling supporting the metastatic behavior of tumor cells lacking NCLX. Our results reveal that loss of NCLX expression is a novel driver of metastatic progression, indicating that control of mtCa2+ levels is a novel therapeutic approach in metastatic colorectal cancer.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe expression of NCLX is decreased in colorectal tumors and is associated with advanced-stage disease in patients.\nC_LIO_LINCLX plays a dichotomous role in colorectal tumor growth and metastasis.\nC_LIO_LINCLX downregulation causes mitophagy and reduced colorectal cancer tumor growth.\nC_LIO_LINCLX downregulation induces stemness, chemoresistance and metastasis through mtCa2+/ROS/HIF1 signaling axis.\nC_LI\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=189 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/083071v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (60K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@30360dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12ca72borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9328ddorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15ffcdb_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG SignificanceMitochondrial Ca2+ (mtCa2+) homeostasis is essential for cellular metabolism and growth and plays a critical role in cancer progression. mtCa2+ uptake is mediated by an inner membrane protein complex containing the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU). mtCa2+ uptake by the MCU is followed by a [~]100-fold slower mtCa2+ extrusion mediated by the inner mitochondrial membrane ion transporter, the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger NCLX. Because NCLX is a slower transporter than the MCU, it is a crucial rate-limiting factor of mtCa2+ homeostasis that cannot easily be compensated by another Ca2+ transport mechanism. This represents the first study investigating the role of NCLX in tumorigenesis and metastasis. We demonstrate for the first time that colorectal cancers exhibit loss of NCLX expression and that this is associated with advanced-stage disease. Intriguingly, decreased NCLX function has a dichotomous role in colorectal cancer. Thus, we reveal that NCLX loss leads to reduced primary tumor growth and overall tumor burden in vivo. Yet, the consequential increases in mtCa2+ elicit pro-survival, hypoxic and gene transcription pathways that enhance metastatic progression. This dichotomy is a well-established feature of chemoresistant and recurrent tumor cells including cancer stem cells. Moreover, the downstream changes elicited by NCLX loss are reminiscent of mesenchymal colorectal cancer subtypes that display poor patient survival. Our data indicate that the demonstrated changes to the mtCa2+/mtROS/HIF1 signaling axis elicited through the loss of NCLX are a key adaptation and driver of metastatic colorectal cancer.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCommon bottlenecks in environmental microbiome studies are the consumable and personnel costs necessary for genomic DNA extraction and sequencing library construction. This is harder for challenging environmental samples such as soil, which is rich in PCR inhibitors. To address this, we have established a low-cost genomic DNA extraction method for inhibitor rich samples alongside an Illumina-compatible 16S and ITS rRNA gene amplicon library preparation workflow that uses common laboratory equipment. We evaluated the performance of our genomic DNA extraction method against two leading commercial soil genomic DNA kits (MoBio PowerSoil(R) and MP Biomedicals FastDNA SPIN) and a recently published non-commercial extraction method by Zou et al. (2017). Our benchmarking experiment used four different soil types (coniferous, broad leafed, and mixed forest plus a standardised cereal crop compost mix) assessing the quality and quantity of the extracted genomic DNA by analysing sequence variants of 16S V4 and ITS rRNA amplicons.\n\nResultsWe found that our genomic DNA extraction method compares well to both commercially available genomic DNA extraction kits in DNA quality and quantity. The MoBio PowerSoil(R) kit, which relies on silica column-based DNA extraction with extensive washing delivered the cleanest genomic DNA e.g. best A260:A280 and A260:A230 absorbance ratios. The MP Biomedicals FastDNA SPIN kit, which uses a large amount of binding material, yielded the most genomic DNA. Our method fits between the two commercial kits, producing both good yields and clean genomic DNA with fragment sizes of approximately 10 kb. Comparative analysis of detected amplicon sequence variants shows that our method correlates well with the two commercial kits.\n\nConclusionHere we present a low-cost genomic DNA extraction method for inhibitor rich sample types such as soil that can be coupled to an Illumina-compatible simple two step amplicon library construction workflow for 16S V4 and ITS marker genes. Our method delivers high quality genomic DNA at a fraction of the cost of commercial kits and enables cost-effective, large scale amplicon sequencing projects. Notably our extracted gDNA molecules are long enough to be suitable for downstream techniques such as full gene sequencing or even metagenomics shotgun approaches using long reads (PacBio or Nanopore), 10x Genomics linked reads, Dovetail genomics etc.",

    "abstract": "PurposeNext generation sequencing has progressed rapidly, characterizing microbial communities beyond culture-based or biochemical techniques. 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing (16S) produces reliable taxonomic classifications and relative abundances, while shotgun metagenome sequencing (WMS) allows higher taxonomic and functional resolution at greater cost. The purpose of this study was to determine if 16S and WMS provide congruent information for our patient population from paired fecal microbiome samples.\n\nMethodsPatients with locally advanced cervical cancers were enrolled on a prospective, observational clinical trial with a rectal swab sample collected prior to chemoradiation. Bacterial DNA was extracted from each sample and divided in two parts for 16S or WMS sequencing. We used measures of diversity richness and evenness as comparators of 16S and WMS sequencing. Relative abundances of the most common taxa were also compared between both datasets. Both techniques were tested against baseline patient demographics to assess associations identified with either or both methods.\n\nResultsComparative indices were highly congruent between 16S and WMS. The most abundant genera for 16S and WMS data did not overlap. Overlap was observed at the Phylum level, as expected. However, relative abundances correlated poorly between the two methodologies (all p>0.05). Hierarchical clustering of both sequencing analyses identified overlapping enterotypes. Both approaches were in agreement with regard to demographic variables.\n\nConclusionDiversity, evenness and richness are comparable when using 16S and WMS techniques, however relative abundances of individual genera are not. Clinical associations with diversity and evenness metrics were similarly identified with WMS or 16S.\n\nImportanceThe gut microbiome plays an important role in regulating human health and disease. 16S rRNA gene sequencing (16S) and the whole-metagenome shotgun DNA sequencing (WMS) are two approaches to describe the microbial community. 16S sequencing via any amplicon sequencing-based method offers advantages over WMS in terms of precision (specific gene targeting). Additionally, 16S has historically been less costly due to the simplicity of library preparation and it does not require the same level read coverage as WMS. In this study, we performed both sequencing methods on a single rectal swab sample obtained from each cervical cancer patient prior to treatment. We showed that these two methods provide comparable information for diversity, evenness, and richness at higher taxonomic resolution, but are discrepant at a lower resolution. These methodological findings provide valuable information for the design and interpretation of future investigations of the role of the gut microbiome in cancer.\n\nTweet(optional: 256 words, please submit a Tweet that conveys the essential message of your manuscript.) 16S may be sufficient for most initial studies of the gut microbiome in cancer patients, but WMS may be required for analysis of lower level taxonomy.\n\nResearch supportThis research was supported in part by the Radiological Society of North America Resident/Fellow Award (to L.E.C.), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) through MD Andersons Cancer Center Support Grant P30CA016672, the Emerson Collective and the National Institutes of Health T32 grant #5T32 CA101642-14 (T.T.S).

    "abstract": "Because regular sleep disruption can increase vulnerability to stress-related psychiatric disorders, there is a need to explore novel countermeasures to increase stress resilience after inadequate sleep. In this study, we explored the impact of 5 days of intermittent sleep disruption on vulnerability to acute social defeat stress in mice, and investigated the ability of the environmental, immunomodulatory bacterium Mycobacterium vaccae NCTC 11659 (MV) to promote stress resilience in that context. We found that mice receiving sleep disruption plus acute stress developed sleep and behavioral phenotypes that had some features of human posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) including reduced NREM delta power and increased NREM beta power in post-stress sleep EEG, persistent increases in sleep fragmentation and the REM:Sleep ratio, and behavioral changes. Importantly, immunization with heat-killed MV prevented the development of this phenotype. These results support further research into novel, microbial-based countermeasures to improve health and increase resilience to sleep disruption.",

While Design of Experiments (DOE) and media screens have led to many advances, genome editing offers another avenue for enhancing cell metabolism and bioproduction. However the complexity of metabolism, involving thousands of genes, makes it unclear which engineering strategies will result in desired traits. Here we developed a comprehensive pooled CRISPR screen for CHO cell metabolism, including [~]16,000 gRNAs against [~]2500 metabolic enzymes and regulators. We demonstrated the value of this screen by identifying a glutamine response network in CHO cells. Glutamine is particularly important since it is often substantially over-fed to drive increased TCA cycle flux but can lead to accumulation of toxic ammonia. Within the glutamine-response network, the deletion of a novel and poorly characterized lipase, Abhd11, was found to substantially increase growth in glutamine-free media by altering the regulation of the TCA cycle. Thus, the screen provides an invaluable targeted platform to comprehensively study genes involved in any metabolic trait.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIndoor residual spraying (IRS) is an effective method to control malaria-transmitting Anopheles mosquitoes and often complements insecticide-treated mosquito nets, the predominant malaria vector control intervention. With insufficient funds to cover every household, malaria control programs must balance the malaria risk to a particular human community against the financial cost of spraying that community. This study creates a framework for modeling the distance to households for targeting IRS implementation, and applies it to potential risk prioritization strategies in four provinces (Luapula, Muchinga, Eastern, and Northern) in Zambia.\n\nMethodsWe used optimal network models to assess the travel distance of routes between operations bases and human communities identified through remote sensing. We compared network travel distances to Euclidean distances, to demonstrate the importance of accounting for road route costs. We then compared the distance to reaching communities for different risk prioritization strategies assuming sufficient funds to spray 50% of households, using four underlying malarial risk maps: a) predicted Plasmodium falciparum parasite rate in 2-10 year olds (PfPR), or b) predicted probability of the presence of each of three main malaria transmitting anopheline vectors (An. arabiensis, An. funestus, An. gambiae)\n\nResultsThe estimated one-way network route distance to reach communities to deliver IRS ranged from 0.05 - 115.69 Km. Euclidean distance over and under-estimated these routes by -101.21 - 41.79 Km per trip, as compared to the network route method. There was little overlap between risk map prioritization strategies, both at a district-by-district scale, and across all four provinces. At both scales, agreement for inclusion or exclusion from IRS across all four prioritization strategies occurred in less than 10% of houses. The distances to reaching prioritized communities were either lower, or not statistically different from non-prioritized communities, at both scales of strategy.\n\nConclusionVariation in distance to targeted communities differed depending on risk prioritization strategy used, and higher risk prioritization did not necessarily translate into greater distances in reaching a human community. These findings from Zambia suggest that areas with higher malaria burden may not necessarily be more remote than areas with lower malaria burden.",

The timing of novel pathogen arrival into naive species communities can have consequential effects that shape the trajectory of epidemics through populations. Pathogen introductions are often presumed to occur when hosts are highly mobile. However, spread patterns can be influenced by a multitude of other factors including host body condition and infectiousness.\nC_LIO_LIWhite-nose syndrome (WNS) is a seasonal emerging infectious disease of bats, which is caused by the fungal pathogen Pseudogymnoascus destructans. Within-site transmission of P. destructans primarily occurs over winter, however the influence of bat mobility and infectiousness on the seasonal timing of pathogen spread to new populations is unknown. We combined data on host population dynamics and pathogen transmission from 22 bat communities to investigate the timing of pathogen arrival and the consequences of varying pathogen arrival times on disease impacts.\nC_LIO_LIWe found that midwinter arrival of the fungus predominated spread patterns, suggesting that bats were most likely to spread P. destructans when they are highly infectious, but have reduced mobility. In communities where P. destructans was detected in early winter, one species suffered higher fungal burdens and experienced more severe declines than at sites where the pathogen was detected later in the winter, suggesting that the timing of pathogen introduction had consequential effects for some bat communities. We also found evidence of source-sink population dynamics over winter, suggesting some movement among sites occurs during hibernation, even though bats at northern latitudes were thought to be fairly immobile during this period. Winter emergence behavior symptomatic of white-nose syndrome may further exacerbate these winter bat movements to uninfected areas.\nC_LIO_LIOur results suggest that low infectiousness during host migration may have reduced the rate of expansion of this deadly pathogen, and that elevated infectiousness during winter plays a key role in seasonal transmission. Furthermore, our results highlight the importance of both accurate estimation of the timing of pathogen spread and the consequences of varying arrival times to prevent and mitigate the effects of infectious diseases.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Barth Syndrome (BTHS) is a rare X-linked genetic disorder caused by mutations in tafazzin and characterized by loss of cardiolipin and severe cardiomyopathy. Mitochondrial superoxide/H2O2 production has been implicated in the cardiomyopathy observed in different BTHS models. There are at least 11 mitochondrial sites that produce superoxide/H2O2 at significant rates. Which of these sites generate oxidants at excessive rates in BTHS is unknown. Here, we measured the maximum capacity of superoxide/H2O2 production from each site in mitochondria isolated from heart and skeletal muscle of the tafazzin knockdown mice (tazkd) at 3, 7 and 12 months of age. Strikingly, the superoxide/H2O2 production capacities of these sites were overall indistinguishable between tazkd mice and their wildtype littermates across the time points analyzed. The only exception was site GQ in glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase, which was increased in the skeletal muscle of 7 months old tazkd mice. Mitochondrial superoxide/H2O2 production was also measured ex vivo during the oxidation of a complex mixture of substrates mimicking either heart or skeletal muscle cytosol and was found to be indistinguishable between wildtype and tazkd mice. However, we consistently measured decreased FAD-linked respiration in mitochondria isolated from tazkd mice. We conclude that the maximum capacity and ex vivo rates of superoxide/H2O2 production were not increased in mitochondria isolated from heart and skeletal muscle of tazkd mice, despite reduced oxidative capacity. Therefore, it seems unlikely that mitochondrial oxidants contribute to the development of cardiomyopathy in tazkd mice. These observations raise questions about the involvement of mitochondrial oxidants in BTHS pathology.",

    "abstract": "Young blood plasma is known to confer beneficial effects on various organs in mice. However, it was not known whether young plasma rejuvenates cells and tissues at the epigenetic level; whether it alters the epigenetic clock, which is a highly-accurate molecular biomarker of aging. To address this question, we developed and validated six different epigenetic clocks for rat tissues that are based on DNA methylation values derived from n=593 tissue samples. As indicated by their respective names, the rat pan-tissue clock can be applied to DNA methylation profiles from all rat tissues, while the rat brain-, liver-, and blood clocks apply to the corresponding tissue types. We also developed two epigenetic clocks that apply to both human and rat tissues by adding n=850 human tissue samples to the training data. We employed these six clocks to investigate the rejuvenation effects of a plasma fraction treatment in different rat tissues. The treatment more than halved the epigenetic ages of blood, heart, and liver tissue. A less pronounced, but statistically significant, rejuvenation effect could be observed in the hypothalamus. The treatment was accompanied by progressive improvement in the function of these organs as ascertained through numerous biochemical/physiological biomarkers and behavioral responses to assess cognitive functions. Cellular senescence, which is not associated with epigenetic aging, was also considerably reduced in vital organs. Overall, this study demonstrates that a plasma-derived treatment markedly reverses aging according to epigenetic clocks and benchmark biomarkers of aging.",

    "abstract": "Endangered species, despite often living at low population densities, may undergo unexpected density-dependent feedbacks in the case of successful recovery or marked reduction in range. Because density-dependence dynamics can increase risk of extinction, these effects can hamper conservation efforts. In this study, we analyse the dynamics of the largest population of the tamaraw (Bubalus mindorensis), a critically endangered ungulate species endemic to Mindoro island, Philippines. The population is located within a < 3,000 ha area in Mounts Iglit-Baco Natural Park, with limited expansion possibilities. We took advantage of a 21 year time series of tamaraw counts to estimate annual population growth rate and possible density-dependence, accounting for sampling errors in the counts. The tamaraw population has been increasing at an average rate of +5% per year, as would be expected given its protected status by law. Population growth showed strong spatial structuring, with a population growth close to +10% in the core area of protection, and a reduction of abundance of -5% at the periphery of its range, inside the protected area. This range constriction is concerning because our best population dynamics model suggests significant negative density-dependence (Bayes factor = 0.9). The contraction of tamaraw range is likely caused by anthropogenic pressures forcing the species to live at relatively high densities in the core zone where protection is most effective, creating source-sink dynamics. Our study highlights the fact that, despite the continuous population growth over the last two decades, the long-term viability of the Mounts Iglit-Baco Natural Park tamaraw population remains uncertain.",

Colitis, in these models, was induced using either chemicals or select bacteria. Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced colitis model was used widely, over other models, because of the simpler properties of DSS and similarities of the model with colitis in humans. The available models of DSS induced colitis require either longer time to understand the chronic stages of the disease or a shorter time period to study the acute phase. Currently, no composite models exist that can be used to study the acute, chronic and recovery stages of colitis within a reasonably shorter period of time. In the current study, we have developed a newer model system in two differently immune biased (Th-1 and Th-2) mice strains using DSS. We have developed the DSS model to compare the response in C57BL/6 (Th1 biased) and BALB/c (Th2 biased) mice models. We have standardized the dosage for both C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice with zero mortality rates. Using the model developed we studied the acute, chronic and recovery phases of colitis. The differential responses of C57BL/6 and BALB/c revealed that the disease was more severe in C57Bl/6. BALB/c, on the contrary, recovered from the diseased condition more quickly.

Specifically, through applying this process, we propose the combination of using entire spiking activity (ESA) as the input signal and quasi-recurrent neural network (QRNN) based deep learning as the decoding algorithm. We evaluated the performance of ESA-driven QRNN decoder for decoding hand kinematics from neural signals chronically recorded from the primary motor cortex area of a non-human primate. Our proposed method yielded consistently higher decoding performance than any other methods previously reported across long-term recording sessions. Its high decoding performance could sustain, even when spikes were removed from the raw signals. Overall results demonstrate exceptionally high decoding accuracy and chronic robustness, which is highly desirable given it is an unresolved challenge in BMIs.",

    "abstract": "Anticipating near-future events is fundamental to adaptive behavior, whereby neural processing of predictable stimuli is significantly facilitated relative to non-predictable inputs. Neural oscillations appear to be a key anticipatory mechanism by which processing of upcoming stimuli is modified, and they often entrain to rhythmic environmental sequences. Clinical and anecdotal observations have led to the hypothesis that people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) may have deficits in generating predictions in daily life, and as such, a candidate neural mechanism may be failure to adequately entrain neural activity to repetitive environmental patterns. Here, we tested this hypothesis by interrogating rhythmic entrainment both behaviorally and electrophysiologically. We recorded high-density electroencephalography in children with ASD (n=31) and Typically Developing (TD) age- and IQ-matched controls (n=20), while they reacted to an auditory target as quickly as possible. This auditory event was either preceded by predictive rhythmic visual cues, or not. Results showed that while both groups presented highly comparable evoked responses to the visual stimuli, children with ASD showed reduced neural entrainment to the rhythmic visual cues, and altered anticipation of the occurrence of these stimuli. Further, in both groups, neuro-oscillatory phase coherence correlated with behavior. These results describe neural processes that may underlie impaired event anticipation in children with ASD, and support the notion that their perception of events is driven more by instantaneous sensory inputs and less by their temporal predictability.",

Notably, in human newborns, congenital heart defects strongly associate with neurodevelopmental abnormalities, suggesting a common gene/complex underlying both cardiogenesis and neurogenesis. However, due to lack of in vivo studies, the molecular mechanisms that govern both early human heart and brain development remain elusive.\n\nResultsHere, we report ARID1A, which is a DNA-binding-subunit of the SWI/SNF epigenetic complex, controls both neurogenesis and cardiogenesis from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) via employing distinct mechanisms. Knockout of ARID1A (ARID1A-/-) led to spontaneous differentiation of neural cells together with globally enhanced expression of neurogenic genes in undifferentiated hESCs. Additionally, when compared with WT hESCs, cardiac differentiation from ARID1A-/- hESCs was prominently suppressed, whereas neural differentiation was significantly promoted. Whole genome-wide scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and ChIP-seq analyses revealed that ARID1A was required to open chromatin accessibility on promoters of essential cardiogenic genes, and temporally associated with key cardiogenic transcriptional factors T and MEF2C during early cardiac development. However, during early neural development, transcription of most essential neurogenic genes was dependent on ARID1A, which could interact with a known neural restrictive silencer factor REST/NRSF.\n\nConclusionsWe uncovered the opposite roles by ARID1A to govern both early cardiac and neural development from pluripotent stem cells. Global chromatin accessibility on cardiogenic genes is dependent on ARID1A, whereas transcriptional activity of neurogenic genes is under control by ARID1A, possibly through ARID1A-REST/NRSF interaction.",

    "abstract": "The alternative reading frame (ARF) protein is crucial in the cellular response to oncogenic stress, being likewise the second most frequently inactivated gene in a wide spectrum of human cancers. ARF is usually sequestered in the nucleolus by the well-known oncogenic nucleophosmin (NPM) protein and is liberated in response to cell damage to exhibit its tumor-suppressor ability. However, the mechanism underlying ARF activation is unknown. Here we show that mitochondria-to-nucleus translocation of cytochrome c upon DNA damage leads to the break-off of the NPM-ARF ensemble and subsequent release of ARF from the nucleoli. Our structural and subcellular data support a molecular model in which the hemeprotein triggers the extended-to-compact conformation of NPM and competes with ARF for binding to NPM.",

There is currently no vaccine for COVID-19, leaving governments and public health agencies with little defense against the virus aside from advising or enforcing best practices for virus transmission prevention, which include hand-washing, physical distancing, use of face covers, and use of effective disinfectants. In this study, a novel iodine complex called CupriDyne(R) was assessed for its ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. CupriDyne was shown to be effective in inactivating the virus in a time-dependent manner, reducing virus titers by 99% (2 logs) after 30 minutes, and reducing virus titers to below the detection limit after 60 minutes.

Most research on therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 focused on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Spike (S) protein, whereas the vulnerable epitopes and functional mechanism of non-RBD regions are poorly understood. Here we isolated and characterized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) derived from convalescent COVID-19 patients. An mAb targeting the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, named 4A8, exhibits high neutralization potency against both authentic and pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2, although it does not block the interaction between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and S protein. The cryo-EM structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in complex with 4A8 has been determined to an overall resolution of 3.1 Angstrom and local resolution of 3.4 Angstrom for the 4A8-NTD interface, revealing detailed interactions between the NTD and 4A8. Our functional and structural characterizations discover a new vulnerable epitope of the S protein and identify promising neutralizing mAbs as potential clinical therapy for COVID-19.",

Human monoclonal antibodies have very good probability of being safe and effective tools for therapy and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease. Here we describe the screening of PBMCs from seven people who survived Covid-19 infection to isolate human monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Over 1,100 memory B cells were single-cell sorted using the stabilized prefusion form of the spike protein and incubated for two weeks to allow natural production of antibodies. Supernatants from each cell were tested by ELISA for spike protein binding, and positive antibodies were further tested for neutralization of spike binding to receptor(s) on Vero E6 cells and for virus neutralization in vitro. From the 1,167 memory B specific for SARS-CoV-2, we recovered 318 B lymphocytes expressing human monoclonals recognizing the spike protein and 74 of these were able to inhibit the binding of the spike protein to the receptor. Finally, 17 mAbs were able to neutralize the virus when assessed for neutralization in vitro. Lead candidates to progress into the drug development pipeline will be selected from the panel of neutralizing antibodies identified with the procedure described in this study.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryNeutralizing human monoclonal antibodies isolated from Covid-19 convalescent patients for therapeutic and prophylactic interventions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSince December 2019, the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first spread quickly in Wuhan, China, then globally. From previously published evidence, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, are both pivotal entry molecules that enable cellular infection by SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile, increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, or a \"cytokine storm,\" is associated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome that is often observed in critically ill patients.\n\nMethodsWe investigated the expression pattern of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in major organs in the human body, especially under specific disease conditions. Multiple sequence alignment of ACE2 in different species was used to explain animal susceptibility. Moreover, the cell-specific expression patterns of ACE2 and cytokine receptors in the urinary tract were assessed using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Additional biological relevance was determined through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using an ACE2 specific signature.\n\nResultsOur results revealed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were highly expressed in genitourinary organs. ACE2 was highly and significantly expressed in the kidney among individuals with chronic kidney diseases or diabetic nephropathy. In single cells, ACE2 was primarily enriched in gametocytes in the testis, and renal proximal tubules. The receptors for pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially IL6ST, were remarkably concentrated in endothelial cells, macrophages, and spermatogonial stem cells in the testis, and renal endothelial cells, which suggested the occurrence of alternative damaging mechanisms via autoimmune attacks.\n\nConclusionsThis study provided new insights into the pathogenicity mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 that underlie the clinical manifestations observed in the human testis and kidney. These observations might substantially facilitate the development of effective treatments for this rapidly spreading disease.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, resulted in a pandemic. Here, we used recently released X-ray structures of human ACE2 bound to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein (S) from SARS-CoV-2 to predict its binding to ACE2 proteins from different animals, including pets, farm animals, and putative intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2. Comparing the interaction sites of ACE2 proteins known to serve or not serve as receptor allows to define residues important for binding. From the 20 amino acids in ACE2 that contact S up to seven can be replaced and ACE2 can still function as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. These variable amino acids are clustered at certain positions, mostly at the periphery of the binding site, while changes of the invariable residues prevent S-binding or infection of the respective animal. Some ACE2 proteins even tolerate the loss or the acquisition of N-glycosylation sites located near the S-interface. Of note, pigs and dogs which are not or not effectively infected, respectively, have only a few changes in the binding site have relatively low levels of ACE2 in the respiratory tract. Comparison of the RBD of S of SARS-CoV-2 with viruses from bat and pangolin revealed that the latter contains only one substitution, whereas the bat virus exhibits five. However, ACE2 of pangolin exhibit seven changes relative to human ACE2, a similar number of substitutions is present in ACE2 of bats, raccoon, and civet suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may not especially adapted to ACE2 of any of its putative intermediate hosts. These analyses provide new insight into the receptor usage and animal source/origin of SARS-COV-2.\n\nIMPORTANCESARS-CoV-2 is threatening people worldwide and there are no drugs or vaccines available to mitigate its spread. The origin of the virus is still unclear and whether pets and livestock can be infected and transmit SARS-CoV-2 are important and unknown scientific questions. Effective binding to the host receptor ACE2 is the first prerequisite for infection of cells and determines the host range. Our analysis provides a framework for the prediction of potential hosts of SARS-CoV-2. We found that ACE2 from species known to support SARS-CoV-2 infection tolerate many amino acid changes indicating that the species barrier might be low. However, the lower expression of ACE2 in the upper respiratory tract of some pets and livestock means more research and monitoring should be done to explore the animal source of infection and the risk of potential cross-species transmission. Finally, the analysis also showed that SARS-CoV-2 may not specifically adapted to any of its putative intermediate hosts.",

Our study reveals novel interaction data on the variants and SARS-CoV-2. We could show that ACE2-K26R; which is more frequent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population decrease the electrostatic attraction between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2. On the contrary, ACE2-I468V, R219C, K341R, D206G, G211R were found to increase the electrostatic attraction and increase the binding to SARS-CoV-2; ordered by the strength of binding from weakest to strongest.

    "abstract": "Since it was first observed, the COVID-19 pandemic has created a global emergency for national health systems due to millions of confirmed cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths. At a molecular level, the bottleneck for the infection is the binding of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein to ACE2, an enzyme exposed on human cell membranes. Several experimental structures of the ACE2:RBD complex have been made available, however they offer only a static description of the arrangements of the molecules in either the free or bound states. In order to gain a dynamic description of the binding process that is key to infection, we use molecular simulations with a coarse grained model of the RBD and ACE2. We find that binding occurs in an all-or-none way, without intermediates, and that even in the bound state, the RBD exhibits a considerably dynamic behaviour. From short equilibrium simulations started in the unbound state we provide snapshots that result in a tentative mechanism of binding. Our findings may be important for the development of drug discovery strategies that target the RBD.",

We identified for the first time molecular pathways for Heparin-binding, RAGE, miRNA, and PLA2 inhibitors, to be associated with SARS-CoV2 infection. The NRCAM and SAA2 that are involved in severe inflammatory response, and FGF1 and FOXO1 genes, which are associated with immune regulation, were found to be associated with a cellular gene response to COVID-19 infection. Moreover, several cytokines, most significantly the IL-8, IL-6, demonstrated key associations with COVID-19 infection. Interestingly, the only response gene that was shared between the five viral infections was SERPINB1. The PPI study sheds light on genes with high interaction activity that COVID-19 shares with other viral infections. The findings showed that the genetic pathways associated with Rheumatoid arthritis, AGE-RAGE signaling system, Malaria, Hepatitis B, and Influenza A were of high significance. We found that the virogenomic transcriptome of infection, gene modulation of host antiviral responses, and GO terms of both COVID-19 and Ebola are more similar compared to SARS, H1N1, and MERS. This work compares the virogenomic signatures of highly pathogenic viruses and provides valid targets for potential therapy against COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Clinical management of COVID-19 is still complicated due to the lack of therapeutic interventions to reduce the breathing problems, respiratory complications and acute lung injury - which are the major complications of most of the mild to critically affected patients and the molecular mechanisms behind these clinical features are still largely unknown. In this study, we have used the RNA-seq gene expression pattern in the COVID-19 affected lung biopsy cells and compared it with the effects observed in typical cell lines infected with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We performed functional overrepresentation analyses using these differentially expressed genes to signify the processes/pathways which could be deregulated during SARS-CoV-2 infection resulting in the symptomatic impairments observed in COVID-19. Our results showed that the significantly altered processes include inflammatory responses, antiviral cytokine signaling, interferon responses, and interleukin signaling etc. along with downmodulated processes related to lungs functionality like-responses to hypoxia, lung development, respiratory processes, cholesterol biosynthesis and surfactant metabolism. We also found that the viral protein interacting hosts proteins involved in similar pathways like: respiratory failure, lung diseases, asthma, and hypoxia responses etc., suggesting viral proteins might be deregulating the processes related to acute lung injury/breathing complications in COVID-19 patients. Protein-protein interaction networks of these processes and map of gene expression of deregulated genes revealed that several viral proteins can directly or indirectly modulate the host genes/proteins of those lung related processes along with several host transcription factors and miRNAs. Surfactant proteins and their regulators SPD, SPC, TTF1 etc. which maintains the stability of the pulmonary tissue are found to be downregulated through viral NSP5, NSP12 that could lead to deficient gaseous exchange by the surface films. Mitochondrial dysfunction owing to the aberration of NDUFA10, NDUFAF5, SAMM50 etc. by NSP12; abnormal thrombosis in lungs through atypical PLAT, EGR1 functions by viral ORF8, NSP12; dulled hypoxia responses due to unusual shift in HIF-1 downstream signaling might be the causative elements behind the acute lung injury in COVID-19 patients. Our study put forward a distinct mechanism of probable virus induced lung damage apart from cytokine storm and advocate the need of further research for alternate therapy in this direction.",

    "abstract": "The constant rise of the death toll and cases of COVID-19 has made this pandemic a serious threat to human civilization. Understanding of host-SARS-CoV-2 interaction in viral pathogenesis is still in its infancy. In this study we aimed to correlate how SARS-CoV-2 utilizes its proteins for tackling the host immune response; parallelly, how host epigenetic factors might play a role in this pathogenesis was also investigated. We have utilized a blend of computational and knowledgebase approach to elucidate the interplay between host and SARS-CoV-2. Integrating the experimentally validated host interactome proteins and differentially expressed host genes due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we have taken a blend of computational and knowledgebase approach to delineate the interplay between host and SARS-CoV-2 in various signaling pathways. Also, we have shown how host epigenetic factors are involved in the deregulation of gene expression. Strikingly, we have found that several transcription factors and other epigenetic factors can modulate some immune signaling pathways, helping both host and virus. We have identified miRNA hsa-miR-429 whose transcription factor was also upregulated and targets were downregulated and this miRNA can have pivotal role in suppression of host immune responses. While searching for the pathways in which viral proteins interact with host proteins, we have found pathways like-HIF-1 signaling, autophagy, RIG-I signaling, Toll-like receptor signaling, Fatty acid oxidation/degradation, Il-17 signaling etc significantly associated. We observed that these pathways can be either hijacked or suppressed by the viral proteins, leading to the improved viral survival and life-cycle. Moreover, pathways like-Relaxin signaling in lungs suggests aberration by the viral proteins might lead to the lung pathophysiology found in COVID-19. Also, enrichment analyses suggest that deregulated genes in SARS-CoV-2 infection are involved in heart development, kidney development, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications etc. might suggest why patients with comorbidities are becoming more prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 integrates its proteins in different immune signaling pathway and other cellular signaling pathways for developing efficient immune evasion mechanisms, while leading the host to more complicated disease condition. Our findings would help in designing more targeted therapeutic interventions against SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "International travel played a significant role in the early global spread of SARS-CoV-2. Understanding transmission patterns from different regions of the world will further inform global dynamics of the pandemic. Using data from Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a major international travel hub in the Middle East, we establish SARS-CoV-2 full genome sequences from the index and early COVID-19 patients in the UAE. The genome sequences are analysed in the context of virus introductions, chain of transmissions, and possible links to earlier strains from other regions of the world. Phylogenetic analysis showed multiple spatiotemporal introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the UAE from Asia, Europe, and the Middle East during the early phase of the pandemic. We also provide evidence for early community-based transmission and catalogue new mutations in SARS-CoV-2 strains in the UAE. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the global transmission network of SARS-CoV-2.",
