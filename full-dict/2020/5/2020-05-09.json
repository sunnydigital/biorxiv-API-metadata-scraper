    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo compare the early responses to joint injury in conventional and germ-free mice.\n\nDesignPost traumatic osteoarthritis PTOA was induced using a non-invasive anterior cruciate ligament rupture model in 20-week old germ-free (GF) and conventional C57BL/6 mice. Injury was induced in the left knees of n=8 GF and n=10 conventional mice. To examine the effects of injury, n=5 GF and n=9 conventional control mice were used. Mice were euthanized seven days post-injury, followed by synovial fluid recovery for global metabolomic profiling and analysis of epiphyseal trabecular bone by micro-computed tomography (CT). Global metabolomic profiling assessed metabolic differences in the joint response to injury between GF and conventional mice. Magnitude of trabecular bone volume loss measured using CT assessed early OA progression in GF and conventional mice.\n\nResultsCT found that GF mice had significantly less trabecular bone loss compared to conventional mice, indicating that the GF status was protective against early OA changes in bone structure. Global metabolomic profiling showed that conventional mice had greater variability in their metabolic response to injury, and a more distinct joint metabolome compared to their corresponding controls. Furthermore, differences in the response to injury in GF compared to conventional mice were linked to mouse metabolic pathways that regulate inflammation associated with the innate immune system.\n\nConclusionsThese results suggest that the gut microbiota promote the development of PTOA during the acute phase following joint trauma possibly through the regulation of the innate immune system.",

    "abstract": "During a PCR-based screen of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) associated with integrons in saliva-derived metagenomic DNA of healthy human volunteers, two novel variants of genes encoding a D-alanine-D-alanine ligase (ddl6 and ddl7) located within gene cassettes in the first position of a reverse integron were identified. Treponema denticola was identified as the likely host of the ddl cassettes. Both ddl6 and ddl7 conferred high level resistance to D-cycloserine when expressed in Escherichia coli with ddl7 conferring four-fold higher resistance to D-cycloserine compared to ddl6. A SNP was found to be responsible for this difference in resistance phenotype between both ddl variants. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to explain the mechanism of this phenotypic change at the atomic scale. A hypothesis for the evolutionary selection of ddl containing integron gene cassettes is proposed, based on molecular docking of plant metabolites within the ATP and D-cycloserine binding pockets of Ddl.\n\nSignificance StatementThe drivers of antimicrobial resistance are varied and numerous. One such hypothesis is that compounds not normally considered to be antibiotics may be able to select for genes that can provide resistance to conventional antibiotics. Here we provide evidence that dietary flavonoids are likely to provide the selective pressure for two novel variants of the ddl gene, encoding D-alanine-D-alanine ligases, to be maintained as the first gene cassette of a reverse integron detectable in the human oral cavities from both the UK and Bangladesh. We show that Ddl is functional, able to confer resistance to D-cycloserine and that the dietary flavonoids quercetin and apigenin are likely able to compete with both ATP and D-cycloserine within their Ddl binding sites.",

    "abstract": "The threshold for immunogenic clonal fraction in a heterogeneous solid tumor required to induce effective bystander killing of non-immunogenic subclones is unknown. Pancreatic cancer poses crucial challenges for immune therapeutic interventions due to low mutational burden and consequent lack of neoantigens. Here, we designed a model to incorporate artificial neoantigens into genes of interest in cancer cells and to test the potential of said antigens to actuate bystander killing. By precisely controlling the abundance of a neoantigen in the tumor, we studied the impact of neoantigen frequency on immune response and immune escape. Our results showed that a single, strong, widely expressed neoantigen could lead to a robust antitumor response when at least 80% of cancer cells express the neoantigen. Further, immunological assays revealed induction of T-cell responses against a non-target self-antigen on KRAS oncoprotein, when we inoculated animals with a high frequency of tumor cells expressing a test neoantigen. Using nanoparticle-based gene therapy, we successfully altered the tumor microenvironment by perturbing interleukin-12 and interleukin-10 gene expression. The subsequent remodeling of the microenvironment reduced the threshold of neoantigen frequency at which bioluminescent signal intensity for tumor burden decreased 1.5-logfold, marking a robust tumor growth inhibition, from 83% to as low as 29%. Our results thus suggest that bystander killing is rather inefficient in immunologically cold tumors like pancreatic cancer and requires an extremely high abundance of neoantigens. However, the bystander killing mediated antitumor response can be rescued, when supported by adjuvant immune therapy.",

    "abstract": "Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), including zoonotic arboviruses, present a global health threat. Multiple components of human land use change have been linked to arboviral emergence, but one pervasive factor that has received comparatively little attention is light pollution. Although often considered a component of built environments, artificial light at night (ALAN) outpaces the growth and spatial extent of urbanization, and thus affects areas where human population density and anthropogenic land changes are modest. West Nile virus (WNV) emergence has been described as peri-urban, but recent research suggests that its relative ubiquity in human-altered environments might actually be due to ALAN. Indeed, we found previously that experimental ALAN exposure enhanced avian competence to transmit WNV to mosquitoes. In the present study, we asked whether such organismal effects manifest ecologically by determining whether WNV exposure among sentinel chickens in Florida is related to local ALAN conditions. We found strong support for a nonlinear relationship between ALAN and WNV exposure in chickens with peak WNV risk occurring at low ALAN levels. Importantly, effects of ALAN on WNV exposure were stronger than other aspects of urbanization; only ambient temperature in the month prior to sampling had a comparable effect to ALAN. These results represent the first field evidence that ALAN might affect infectious disease exposure risk. We advocate for further research on how ALAN influences zoonotic risk, as well as efforts to study alternative nighttime lighting methods to reduce such risk.\n\nSignificance StatementLight pollution associated with human development is a globally pervasive and rapidly expanding anthropogenic stressor; but despite documented effects on host immune functions and vector behaviors, how it affects infectious disease risk is unknown. Using data from the Florida Department of Health arbovirus surveillance program, we show that light pollution is a stronger predictor of variation in West Nile virus (WNV) exposure risk than many other previously implicated anthropogenic and natural environmental variables. Light pollution effects are nonlinear, so risk is highest in areas with dim light pollution. Our results highlight a new way that light pollution might affect human and wildlife health.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput Plasmodium genomic data is increasingly useful in assessing prevalence of clinically important mutations and malaria transmission patterns. Understanding parasite diversity is important for identification of specific human or parasite populations that can be targeted by control programs, and to monitor the spread of mutations associated with drug resistance. An up-to-date understanding of regional parasite population dynamics is also critical to monitor the impact of control efforts. However, this data is largely absent from high-burden nations in Africa, and to date, no such analysis has been conducted for malaria parasites in Tanzania country-wide. To this end, over 1,000 P. falciparum clinical isolates were collected in 2017 from 13 sites in seven administrative regions across Tanzania, and parasites were genotyped at 1,800 variable positions genome-wide using molecular inversion probes. Population structure was detectable among Tanzanian P. falciparum parasites, roughly separating parasites from the northern and southern districts and identifying genetically admixed populations in the north. Isolates from geographically close districts were more likely to be genetically related compared to parasites sampled from more distant districts. Known drug resistance mutations were seen at increased frequency in northern districts, and additional variants with undetermined significance for antimalarial resistance also varied by geography. Malaria Indicator Survey (2017) data corresponded with genetic findings, including average region-level complexity-of-infection and malaria prevalence estimates. The parasite populations identified here provide important information on extant spatial patterns of genetic diversity of Tanzanian parasites, to which future surveys of genetic relatedness can be compared.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEDocumenting dynamics of malaria parasite genomics in high-transmission settings at scale in sub-Saharan Africa is critical for policy and decision making to support ongoing malaria elimination initiatives. Using molecular inversion probes, we genotyped over 1,000 Tanzanian Plasmodium falciparum samples collected country-wide in 2017 at hundreds of variable polymorphic positions across the genome. Frequencies of known drug resistance mutations were higher in northern districts of the country compared to the south. Results also showed a distinct isolation-by-distance pattern (whereby increasing geographic distance was correlated with decreasing genetic relatedness), as well as signals of higher genetic sharing between several southern districts. These results provide, for the first time, a picture of current within-country diversity of Tanzanian P. falciparum populations.",

We analyzed 4D-CT acquisitions of LA wall motion with an in-house immersed-boundary CFD solver. We considered six patients with diverse atrial function, three without a LAA thrombus (LAAT/TIA-neg), and three with either a LAA thrombus (removed digitally before running the simulations) or a history of transient ischemic attacks (LAAT/TIA-pos). We found that blood inside the left atrial appendage of LAAT/TIA-pos patients had marked alterations in residence time and kinetic energy when compared with LAAT/TIA-neg patients. In addition, we showed how the LA conduit, reservoir and booster functions distinctly affect LA and LAA hemodynamics. While the flow dynamics of fixed-wall and moving-wall simulations differ significantly, fixed-wall simulations risk-stratified our small cohort for LAA thrombosis only slightly worse than moving-wall simulations.",

    "abstract": "Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are epigenome modulating molecules that target histone and non-histone proteins and have been successfully used to target many types of cancer and immunological disorders. While HDACis effects on nuclear histone deacetylases are well characterized, their effect on non-nuclear, cytoplasmic molecules requires further investigation. In the current study we characterized the effects of class I/II HDACi, specifically, TSA, MS-275, and SAHA, on plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) biology upon viral activation via the TLR7/9 pathway. TSA, MS-275, and SAHA, down-modulated the induction of IFN- and TNF- upon Influenza A virus (IAV; TLR7 signaling) and Herpes Simplex 1 (HSV-1; TLR9 signaling) stimulation in primary pDC. The HDACi inhibitory effect was more prominent for IAV-mediated responses than for HSV-1. While IFN- induction was not associated with inhibition of IRF-7 upregulation in the presence of TSA or MS-275, IRF-7 upregulation was affected by SAHA, but only for IAV. Furthermore, TSA, but not MS-275, inhibited TLR7/9-induced expression of maturation markers, CD40, and CD86, but not CD40. In addition, HDACi treatment increased virally-induced shedding of CD62L. Mechanistically, TSA, MS-275, SAHA significantly decreased early IRF-7 and NF-{kappa}B nuclear translocation, which was preceded by a decline in phosphorylation of IRF-7 at Ser477/479 and NF-{kappa}B p-p65, except for MS-275. In summary, we propose that broad HDACi, but not class I HDACi, treatment can negatively impact early TLR7/9-mediated signaling, namely, the disruption of IRF-7 and NF-{kappa}B activation and translocation that lead to deleterious effects on pDC function.",

    "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is of global importance with over 2 billion people exposed to the virus during their lifetime and at risk of progressive liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HBV is a member of the hepadnaviridae family that replicates via episomal copies of a covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) genome. The chromatinization of this small viral genome, with overlapping open reading frames and regulatory elements, suggests an important role for epigenetic pathways to regulate viral transcription. The chromatin-organising transcriptional insulator protein CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) has been reported to regulate transcription in a diverse range of viruses. We identified two conserved CTCF binding sites in the HBV genome within Enhancer I and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis demonstrated an enrichment of CTCF binding to integrated or episomal copies of the viral genome. siRNA knockdown of CTCF results in a significant increase in pre-genomic RNA levels in de novo infected HepG2 cells and those supporting episomal HBV DNA replication. Furthermore, mutation of these sites in HBV DNA minicircles abrogated CTCF binding and increased pre-genomic RNA levels, providing evidence of a direct role for CTCF in repressing HBV transcription.\n\nIMPORTANCEHepatitis B virus (HBV) is a global cause of liver disease. At least 300 million individuals are chronically infected with HBV, frequently leading to life-threatening liver cirrhosis and cancer. Following viral entry, HBV DNA enters the nucleus and is bound by histones that are subject to epigenetic modification. The HBV genome contains two enhancer elements that stimulate viral transcription but the interplay between the viral enhancers and promoters is not fully understood. We have identified the host cell protein CCCTC binding factor (CTCF) as a repressor of HBV gene expression. CTCF binds to the HBV genome within Enhancer I and represses transcription of pre-genomic RNA. These findings provide new insights into how HBV transcription is regulated and show a new role for CTCF as a transcriptional insulator by associating with the viral genome between Enhancer I and the downstream basal core promoter.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly transmittable and pathogenic viral infection caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which emerges in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and spreads around the world at the beginning of 2020. The World Health Organization declares the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on the 30th of January, and a pandemic on the 11th of March. On the 4th of March, the Italian government orders the full closure of all schools and universities nationwide.The aim of this study is to investigate the knowledge, practice and attitudes (KAP) of secondary school at the time of COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. In this cross-sectional, web-based survey, conducted among the high school student population with age ranging from 14 to 19 years old, a questionnaire with 19 items regarding the KAP toward COVID-19 is asked. Study participants are recruited from several secondary schools of different areas. Frequencies and histograms are computed for descriptive purposes. Statistical analysis is computed with Chi square test, utilized to depict relevant difference between geender. Among a total of 2380 students who answers the questionnaire, 40.7% are male and 59.3% are female.Level of knowledge about generical characteristics of COVID-19 is quite similar among gender. Students present a good level of knowledge about the clinical presentation of the disease, the basic hygiene principles, the modes of transmission and the method of protection against virus transmission. The knowledge about number of this pandemia and easy scientific correlation with COVID-19 is quite confused. The most frequently reported source of knowledge about COVID-19 is television, whereas the less is the school. Our findings suggest that student population shows appropriate practice, and positive attitude towards COVID-19 at the time of its outbreak.More emphasis should be placed on education of the student partecipants about biological meaning of this infection and relative preventive or future measures.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",
