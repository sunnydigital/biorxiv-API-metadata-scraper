    "abstract": "Sex determination and differentiation is a complex process regulated by multiple factors, including factors from the germline or surrounding somatic tissue. In zebrafish, sex-determination begins with establishment of a bipotential gonad that undergoes sex-specific differentiation and maintenance to form the functional adult gonad. However, the relationships among these factors are not fully understood. Here we identify potential Rbpms2 targets and apply genetic epistasis experiments to decipher the genetic hierarchy of regulators of sex-specific differentiation. We provide evidence that the critical female factor, rbpms2 is epistatic to the male factor dmrt1 in terms of adult sex. Moreover, Rbpms2s role in promoting female fates extends beyond repression of Dmrt1, as Rbpms2 is essential for female differentiation even in the absence of Dmrt1. In contrast, female fates can be restored in mutants lacking cyp19a1a in the absence of dmrt1. Taken together this work indicates that Cyp19a1a-mediated suppression of Dmrt1 is key to establish a bipotential gonad and initiate female fate acquisition, possibly by promoting rbpms2. Then, after female fate specification, Cyp19a1a regulates subsequent oocyte maturation and sustains female fates independent of Dmrt1 repression.\n\nAuthor SummaryWe show that cyp19a1a-mediated suppression of dmrt1 establishes a bipotential gonad and female fate acquisition, possibly through rbpms2 which is required for female fates, even in the absence of Dmrt1.",

    "abstract": "Forced abstinence (FA) from alcohol has been shown to produce a variety of anxiety- and depression- like symptoms in animal models. Somatostatin (SST) neurons, a subtype of GABAergic neurons found throughout the brain, are a novel neural target with potential treatment implications in affective disorders, yet their role in alcohol use disorders (AUD) remains to be explored. Here, we examined the neuroadaptations of SST neurons during forced abstinence from voluntary alcohol consumption. Following six weeks of two-bottle choice alcohol consumption and protracted forced abstinence, male and female C57BL/6J mice exhibited a heightened, but sex-specific, depressive-like behavioral profile in the sucrose preference test (SPT) and forced swim test (FST), without changes in anxiety-like behaviors in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and open field test (OFT). FST-induced cFos expressions in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and ventral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (vBNST) were altered in FA-exposed female mice only, suggesting a sex-specific effect of forced abstinence on the neural response to acute stress. SST immunoreactivity in these regions was unaffected by forced abstinence, while differences were seen in SST/cFos co-expression in the vBNST. No differences in cFos or SST immunoreactivity were seen in the lateral central nucleus of the amygdala (CEA) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Additionally, SST neurons displayed opposing alterations in the PFC and vBNST, with heightened intrinsic excitability in the PFC and diminished intrinsic excitability in the vBNST. These findings provide an overall framework of forced abstinence-induced neuroadaptations in these key brain regions involved in emotional regulation and processing.",

    "abstract": "Dyslexia, defined as a specific impairment in decoding the written script, is the most widespread learning difficulty. However, individuals with dyslexia (IDDs) also consistently manifest reduced short-term memory (STM) capacity, typically measured by Digit Span or non-word repetition tasks. In this paper we report two experiments which test the effect of item frequency and the effect of a repeated sequence on the performance in STM tasks in good readers and in IDDs. IDDs performance benefited less from item frequency, revealing poor use of long-term single item statistics. This pattern suggests that the amply reported shorter verbal spans in dyslexia may in fact reflect their impaired sensitivity to items long-term frequency. For repeated sequence learning, we found no significant deficit among IDDs, even when a sensitive paradigm and a robust measure were used.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms proposed for eukaryogenesis are divisible into mitochondria-early and mitochondria-late ones, where the mitochondriate-eukaryotes (MTEs) were evolutionary precursors or products of the amitochondriate-eukaryotes (AMIs) respectively. Analysis of prokaryote-to-eukaryote gene transfers in eukaryogenesis showed two tranches of high-intensity transfers from prokaryotes to eukaryotes mediated by endosymbioses that gave rise to mitochondria and chloroplasts, and hundreds of medium-intensity transfers which included the transfer of hydrogenase and pyruvate: ferredoxin oxidoreductase genes from the Thermoanaerobacter-Hungateiclostridium-Sporanaerobacter group to the AMIs. Since 94.5% of these medium-intensity transfers generated more than 100 inter-proteome similarity hits between each donor-recipient pair, they were not readily explicable by horizontal gene transfers (HGTs) or endosymbioses, pointing instead to the participation of a large number of ectosymbiotic transfers. The euryarchaeon Aciduliprofundum boonei (Abo) and the gammaproteobacterium Escherichia coli (Eco) were the foremost contributors of archaeal and bacterial genes for the eukaryotic DNA-apparatus respectively, and the Abo/Eco ratios for the prokaryote-derived genes in eukaryotes decreased from Microsporidia to other AMIs, and even more so in the MTEs. These findings supported an ectosymbiosis-based mechanism of eukaryogenesis with Abo as the Archaeal Parent of Eukarya, and Microsporidia as the eukaryotes phylogenetically closest to the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA).",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional reconstruction of the electron scattering potential of biological macromolecules from electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) projection images is an ill-posed problem. The most popular cryo-EM software solutions to date rely on a regularisation approach that is based on the prior assumption that the scattering potential varies smoothly over three-dimensional space. Although this approach has been hugely successful in recent years, the amount of prior knowledge it exploits compares unfavourably to the knowledge about biological structures that has been accumulated over decades of research in structural biology. Here, we present a regularisation framework for cryo-EM structure determination that exploits prior knowledge about biological structures through a convolutional neural network that is trained on known macromolecular structures. We insert this neural network into the iterative cryo-EM structure determination process through an approach that is inspired by Regularisation by Denoising. We show that the new regularisation approach yields better reconstructions than the current state-of-the-art for simulated data and discuss options to extend this work for application to experimental cryo-EM data.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that a stimulus actively maintained in working memory (WM) automatically captures visual attention when subsequently perceived. Such a WM-guidance effect has been consistently observed for stimuli defined by simple features, such as colour or orientation, but studies using more complex stimuli provide inconclusive results. Therefore, we investigated whether the WM-guidance effect occurs also for naturalistic stimuli, whose identity is defined by multiple features and relations among them, specifically for faces and houses. The experiment consisted of multiple blocks in which participants (N = 28) either memorized or merely saw (WM or exposure condition, respectively) a template stimulus and then performed several dot-probe trials, with pairs of stimuli (template and control) presented laterally as distractors and followed by a target-asterisk. Evidence for attentional prioritization of the memorized stimuli was found in the reaction-times (RT) analysis, but not in the analysis of the N2pc ERP component, which raises questions concerning the attentional mechanism involved. Further, in an exploratory ERP analysis we found evidence for a very early (100-200 ms post-stimulus) prioritization specific to the memorized faces, which is in line with the sensory recruitment theory of WM.",

    "abstract": "Motor inhibition is a key control mechanism that allows humans to rapidly adapt their actions in response to environmental events. One of the hallmark signatures of rapidly exerted, reactive motor inhibition is the non-selective suppression of cortico-spinal excitability (CSE): unexpected sensory stimuli lead to a suppression of CSE across the entire motor system, even in muscles that are inactive. Theories suggest that this reflects a fast, automatic, and broad engagement of inhibitory control, which facilitates behavioral adaptations to unexpected changes in the sensory environment. However, it is an open question whether such non-selective CSE suppression is truly due to the unexpected nature of the sensory event, or whether it is sufficient for an event to be merely infrequent (but not unexpected). Here, we report data from two experiments in which human subjects experienced both unexpected and expected infrequent events during a simple reaction time task while CSE was measured from a task-unrelated muscle. We found that expected infrequent events can indeed produce non-selective CSE suppression - but only when they occur during movement initiation. In contrast, unexpected infrequent events produce non-selective CSE suppression even in the absence of movement initiation. Moreover, CSE suppression due to unexpected events occurs at shorter latencies compared to expected infrequent events. These findings demonstrate that unexpectedness and stimulus infrequency have qualitatively different suppressive effects on the motor system. They also have key implications for studies that seek to disentangle neural and psychological processes related to motor inhibition and stimulus detection.",

    "abstract": "Multiple chemical reactions, such as the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can lead to dityrosine (DiY) formation via the cross-linking of closely spaced tyrosine residues and this can serve as a marker for aging. Amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) has been found to be DiY cross-linked in the brains of AD patients. In vitro, A{beta} forms DiY cross-links via metal-catalysed oxidation (Cu2+ and H202) (MCO) leading to the formation of fibrils that are resistant to formic acid denaturation. However, copper is well known to influence and enhance self-assembly. Here, to investigate the interplay between self-assembly and DiY cross-linking we have utilised a non-assembly competent variant of A{beta} (vA{beta}). MCO and UV oxidation experiments using vA{beta} and wild-type A{beta}, revealed that DiY cross-linking stabilises, but does not induce or promote A{beta} assembly. Cu2+ alone, without H202, facilitates the formation and DiY cross-linking of wild-type A{beta} into long-lived oligomers. Our work reveals DiY formation halts further A{beta} self-assembly. DiY cross-linked A{beta} is non-toxic to neuroblastoma cells at all stages of self-assembly in contrast to oligomeric non-cross-linked A{beta}. These findings point to a mechanism of toxicity that necessitates continuing self-assembly of the A{beta} peptide, whereby trapped DiY A{beta} assemblies and assembly incompetent variant A{beta} are unable to result in cell death.",

Noninvasive detection of the ZI and surrounding region could be critical to further our understanding of this widely connected but poorly understood deep brain region and could contribute to the development and optimization of neuromodulatory therapies. We demonstrate that high resolution (submillimetric) longitudinal (T1) relaxometry measurements at high magnetic field strength (7 Tesla) can be used to delineate the ZI from surrounding white matter structures, specifically the fasciculus cerebellothalamicus, fields of Forel (fasciculus lenticularis, fasciculus thalamicus, field H), and medial lemniscus. Using this approach, we successfully derived in vivo estimates of the size, shape, location, and tissue characteristics of substructures in the ZI region, confirming observations only previously possible through histological evaluation that this region is not just a space between structures but contains distinct morphological entities that should be considered separately. Our findings pave the way for increasingly detailed in vivo study and provide a structural foundation for precise functional and neuromodulatory investigation.",

However, it remains incompletely understood on its structure and whether it contributes to the central actions of oxytocin and vasopressin. Using viral tracing and whole brain imaging, we reconstructed the three-dimensional architecture of the HNS and uncovered that subsets of MNCs collaterally project to multiple extrahypothalamic regions. Moreover, selective activation of magnocellular oxytocin neurons promoted peripheral oxytocin release and facilitated central oxytocin-mediated social interactions. Further, MNCs-released oxytocin in the caudate putamen enhanced locomotion to orchestrate social investigation. Our work reveals the previously unrecognized complexity of the HNS and provides structural and functional evidence for MNCs in coordinating both peripheral and central oxytocin-mediated actions, which will shed light on the mechanistic understanding of oxytocin-related psychiatric diseases.",

    "abstract": "Genes within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are the most variable identified in vertebrates. Pathogen-mediated selection (PMS) is believed to be the main force maintaining diversity at MHC class I and II genes, but it has proven hard to demonstrate the exact PMS regime that is acting in natural populations. Demonstrating contemporary selection on MHC alleles is not trivial, and previous work has been constrained by limited genetic tools, low sample sizes and short time scales and has sometimes involved anticonservative statistical approaches. Here, we use appropriate statistical approaches to examine associations between MHC variation and several fitness measurements including total fitness (lifetime breeding success) and five fitness components, in 3400 wild Soay sheep (Ovis aries) monitored over their lifetimes between 1989 and 2012. We found haplotypes C and D were associated with decreased and increased male total fitness respectively. In terms of fitness components, juvenile survival was positively associated with haplotype divergence. Of the eight MHC haplotypes (A-H), haplotypes C and F were associated with decreased adult male breeding success and decreased adult female life span respectively. Consistent with the increased male total fitness, haplotype D, which is the rarest, has increased in frequency throughout the study period. Our results suggest that contemporary balancing selection is acting on MHC class II genes in Soay sheep and that different selection mechanisms are acting between juveniles and adults.",

    "abstract": "Improving the accuracy of variant interpretation during diagnostic sequencing is a major goal for genomic medicine. In order to explore an often overlooked splicing effect of missense variants, we developed the functional assay (\"minigene\") for the majority of exons of CAPN3, the gene responsible for Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy (LGMD). By systematically screening 21 missense variants distributed along the gene, we found that eight clinically relevant missense variants located at a certain distance from the exon/intron borders (deep exonic missense variants) disrupted normal splicing of CAPN3 exons. Several recent machine learning based computational tools failed to predict splicing impact for the majority of these deep exonic missense variants, highlighting the importance of including variants of this type in the training sets during the future algorithm development. Overall, 24 variants in CAPN3 gene were explored, leading to the change in the ACMG classification of seven of them when results of the \"minigene\" functional assay were taken into account. Our findings reveal previously unknown splicing impact of several clinically important variants in CAPN3 and draw attention to the existence of deep exonic variants with a disruptive effect on gene splicing that could be overlooked by the current approaches in clinical genetics.",

    "abstract": "The growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system is integral to human growth. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified variants associated with height and located near the genes in this pathway. However, mechanisms underlying these genetic associations are not understood. To investigate the regulation of the genes in this pathway and mechanisms by which regulation could affect growth, we performed GWAS of measured serum protein levels of IGF-I, IGFBP-3, PAPP-A2, IGF-II, and IGFBP-5 in 839 children (3-18 years) from the Cincinnati Genomic Control Cohort. We identified variants associated with protein levels near IGFBP3 and IGFBP5 genes, which contain multiple signals of association with height and other skeletal growth phenotypes. Surprisingly, variants that associate with protein levels at these two loci do not colocalize with height associations, confirmed through conditional analysis. Rather, the IGFBP3 signal (associated with total IGFBP-3 and IGF-II levels) colocalizes with an association with sitting height ratio (SHR); the IGFBP5 signal (associated with IGFBP-5 levels) colocalizes with birth weight. Indeed, height-associated SNPs near genes encoding other proteins in this pathway are not associated with serum levels, possibly excluding PAPP-A2. Mendelian randomization supports a stronger relationship of measured serum levels with SHR (for IGFBP-3) and birth weight (for IGFBP-5) than with height. In conclusion, we begin to characterize the genetic regulation of serum levels of IGF-related proteins in childhood. Furthermore, our data strongly suggest the existence of growth-regulating mechanisms acting through IGF-related genes in ways that are not reflected in measured serum levels of the corresponding proteins.",

    "abstract": "We profile genome-wide histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) of 3 major brain cell types from hippocampus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) of subjects with and without Alzheimers Disease (AD). We confirm that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with late onset AD (LOAD) prefer to reside in the microglial histone acetylome, which varies most strongly with age. We observe acetylation differences associated with AD pathology at 3,598 peaks, predominantly in an oligodendrocyte-enriched population. Strikingly, these differences occur at the promoters of known early onset AD (EOAD) risk genes (APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, BACE1), late onset AD (LOAD) risk genes (BIN1, PICALM, CLU, ADAM10, ADAMTS4, SORL1 and FERMT2), and putative enhancers annotated to other genes associated with AD pathology (MAPT). More broadly, acetylation differences in the oligodendrocyte-enriched population occur near genes in pathways for central nervous system myelination and oxidative phosphorylation. In most cases, these promoter acetylation differences are associated with differences in transcription in oligodendrocytes. Overall, we reveal deregulation of known and novel pathways in AD and highlight genomic regions as therapeutic targets in oligodendrocytes of hippocampus and dlPFC.",

    "abstract": "Containing fungal diseases often depends on the application of fungicidal compounds. Fungicides can rapidly lose effectiveness due to the rise of resistant individuals in populations. However, the lack of knowledge about resistance mutations beyond known target genes challenges investigations into pathways to resistance. We used whole-genome sequencing data and association mapping to reveal the multilocus genetic architecture of fungicide resistance in a global panel of 159 isolates of Parastagonospora nodorum, an important fungal pathogen of wheat. We found significant differences in azole resistance among global field populations. The populations evolved distinctive combinations of resistance alleles which can interact synergistically. We identified 34 significantly associated SNPs located in close proximity to genes associated with fungicide resistance in other fungi, including an MFS transporter. Using fungal colony growth rates and melanin production at different temperatures as fitness proxies, we found no evidence that resistance was constrained by genetic trade-offs. Our study demonstrates how genome-wide association studies of a global collection of pathogen strains can recapitulate the emergence of fungicide resistance. The distinct complement of resistance mutations found among populations illustrates how the evolutionary trajectory of fungicide adaptation can be complex and challenging to predict.",

    "abstract": "Measuring forest degradation is important for understanding and designing measures to protect biodiversity and the capacity of forests to deliver ecosystem services. Conservation planning, particularly the prioritization of management interventions for forests, is often lacking spatial data on ecological condition, and it is often overlooked within decision-making processes. Existing methods for assessing forest degradation via proxies or binary measures (i.e. intact or not) cannot adequately consider the important variations of ecological condition. Direct methods to measure degradation (e.g. through remote sensing) require extensive training data, calibration and validation, and may be too sensitive to small-scale or short-term changes which may not be related to degradation. We developed a metric termed Forest Condition (FC) which aims to measure the degree of forest degradation, incorporating temporal history of forest change over a large spatial extent. We parameterized this metric based on estimated changes in above ground biomass in the context of forest fragmentation over time to estimate a continuous measure of forest degradation for Congo Basin countries. We estimate that just less than 70% of Congo Basin forests remain fully intact. FC was validated by direct remote sensing measurements from Landsat imagery for DRC. Results showed that FC was significantly positively correlated with forest canopy cover, gap area per hectare, and magnitude of temporal change in Normalized Burn Ratio. We tested the ability of FC to distinguish primary and secondary degradation and deforestation and found significant differences in gap area and spectral anomalies to validate our theoretical model. We used the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems criteria to demonstrate the value of applying forest degradation to assess the risk of ecosystem collapse. Based on this assessment, we found that without including FC in the assessment of biotic disruption, 12 ecosystems could not have a threat status assigned, and a further 9 ecosystems would have a lower threat status. Our overall assessment of ecosystems found approximately half of forest of Congo Basin ecosystem types which cover over 20% of all forest area are threatened including 4 ecosystems (<1% of total area) which are critically engendered. FC is a transferrable and scalable assessment to support forest monitoring, planning, and management.",

    "abstract": "Artificial induction of a chromosomal double-strand break in Saccharomyces cerevisiae enhances the frequency of integration of homologous DNA fragments into the broken region by up to several orders of magnitude. The process of homologous repair can be exploited to integrate, in principle, any foreign DNA into a target site, provided the introduced DNA is flanked at both the 5 and 3 ends by sequences homologous to the region surrounding the double-strand break. We have developed a tool set that requires a minimum of steps to induce double-strand breaks at chromosomal target sites with the meganuclease I-SceI and select integration events at those sites. We demonstrate this method in two different applications. First, the introduction of site-specific single-nucleotide phosphorylation site mutations into the S. cerevisiae gene SPO12. Second, the precise chromosomal replacement of eleven S. cerevisiae proteasome genes with their human orthologs. Placing the human genes under S. cerevisiae transcriptional control allowed us to update our of model of functional replacement. Our experience suggests that using native promoters may be a useful general strategy for the coordinated expression of foreign genes in S. cerevisiae. We provide an integrative targeting toolset that will facilitate a variety of precision genome engineering applications.",

    "abstract": "Understanding social organization is fundamental for the analysis of animal societies. In this study, animal single-file movement data -serialized order movements generated by simple bottom-up rules of collective movements-- are informative and effective observations for the reconstruction of animal social structures using agent-based models. For simulation, artificial 2-dimensional spatial distributions were prepared with the simple assumption of clustered structures of a group. Animals in the group are either independent or dependent agents. Independent agents distribute spatially independently each one another, while dependent agents distribute depending on the distribution of independent agents. Artificial agent spatial distributions aim to represent clustered structures of agent locations -a coupling of \"core\" or \"keystone\" subjects and \"subordinate\" or \"follower\" subjects. Collective movements were simulated following two simple rules, 1) initiators of the movement are randomly chosen, and 2) the next moving agent is always the nearest neighbor of the last moving agents, generating \"single-file movement\" data. Finally, social networks were visualized, and clustered structures reconstructed using a recent major social network analysis (SNA) algorithm, the Louvain algorithm, for rapid unfolding of communities in large networks. Simulations revealed possible reconstruction of clustered social structures using relatively minor observations of single-file movement, suggesting possible application of single-file movement observations for SNA use in field investigations of wild animals.",

Using publicly available datasets of cancer samples obtained from mass cytometry and single-cell RNA-seq platforms, outlier cells for the expression of proteins or RNAs were identified and compared to their non-outlier counterparts among different samples.

Increased microbial diversity was observed in dermatomyositis. Viruses were over-represented and species of the Poxviridae family were significantly enriched. The autoantibodies identified recognised a large portion of the human proteome, including interferon regulated proteins; these proteins were clustered in specific biological processes. Apart from TRIM33, autoantibodies against eleven further TRIM proteins, including TRIM21, were identified. Some of these TRIM proteins shared epitope homology with specific viral species including poxviruses.

Besides the well-documented antioxidative stress activity, recent studies suggest that DJ-1 has the deglycation enzymatic activity and the anti-ferroptosis function. Although it has been demonstrated that DJ-1 forms the homodimerization, which dictates its antioxidative stress activity, the relationship between the dimeric structure and newly reported activities remains largely elusive. In this study, we find that the deletion mutation of the last 3 amino acids at C terminus of DJ-1 disrupts its homodimerization in both transfected and purified DJ-1 protein. Further study shows that hydrophobic L187 residue is of great importance for DJ-1 homodimerization. In addition, the ability in methylglyoxal detoxification is almost abolished in the mutation of deleting last 3 residues at C terminus ({Delta}C3) and point mutant L187E compared with wild type DJ-1 (DJ-1 WT). We also find that the suppression of ferroptosis is fully inhibited by {Delta}C3 and L187E while partially suppressed by V51C. Thus, our findings show that C terminus of DJ-1 is crucial for its homodimerization, deglycation activity and suppression of ferroptosis.",

    "abstract": "The atromentin synthetase gene cluster is responsible for catalyzing the precursor pigment atromentin, which is further catalyzed into hundreds of different pigments that span different taxa in the Basidiomycota and is a distinguished feature of Boletales. Previous work identified co-transcription of the two essential clustered atromentin genes (the atromentin synthetase (NPS) and the aminotransferase) by inducible pigment conditions and also conserved genetic elements in the promoter regions (motifs). For this work, we found that the NPS and its promoter motif appeared to follow the same evolutionary path as the mushrooms. The NPS appears to predate Boletales and originate in Agaricomycetes, and with convergent/parallel evolution that allowed ascomycetes to produce atromentin. Additionally, a consensus of the intron-exon gene structure for basidiomycetous, atromentin-catalyzing NPSs was identified whereby a significant deviation occurred in the paraphyletic group, Paxillaceae. This gene structure was not present in NPSs in Aspergilli. Lastly, we found a putative TATA box adjacent to the palindromic motif of NPS, indicating (co-)transcriptional control by a TATA(-like) binding transcription factor. Combined with previous decades worth of research, our results support that not only can atromentin derivatives be used for chemo-taxonomy, but also atromentins genetic basis. Future work using the putative promoter motif will provide new insight into which (co-)transcription factor may be responsible for the transcriptional control of atromentin synthetases.",

Here we address this constellation of critical attributes for successful cellular therapy by using integrated technologies that simplify development and derisk clinical translation. We have developed a CAR-CD19 T cell that secretes a CD19-anti-Her2 bridging protein. This cell therapy strategy exploits the ability of CD19-targeting CAR T cells to interact with CD19 on normal B cells to drive expansion, persistence and fitness. The secreted bridging protein potently binds to Her2-positive tumor cells, mediating CAR-CD19 T cell cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. Because of its short half-life, the secreted bridging protein will selectively accumulate at the site of highest antigen expression, ie. at the tumor. Bridging proteins that bind to multiple different tumor antigens have been created. Therefore, antigen-bridging CAR-CD19 T cells incorporate critical attributes for successful solid tumor cell therapy. This platform can be exploited to attack tumor antigens on any cancer.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDA significant gap in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients care is the lack of molecular parameters characterizing tumors and allowing a personalized treatment. The goal of this study was to examine whole PDAC transcriptomic profiles to define a signature that would predict aggressiveness and treatment responsiveness better than done until now.\n\nMETHODS AND PATIENTSTumors were obtained from 76 consecutive resectable (n=40) or unresectable (n=36) tumors. PDAC were transplanted in mice to produce patient-drived xenografts (PDX). PDX were classified according to their histology into five groups, from highly undifferentiated to well differentiated. This classification resulted strongly associated with tumors aggressiveness. A PDAC molecular gradient (PAMG) was constructed from PDX transcriptomes recapitulating the five histological groups along a continuous gradient. The prognostic and predictive value for PMAG was evaluated in: i/ two independent series (n=598) of resected tumors; ii/ 60 advanced tumors obtained by diagnostic EUS-guided biopsy needle flushing and iii/ on 28 biopsies from mFOLFIRINOX treated metastatic tumors.\n\nRESULTSA unique transcriptomic signature (PAGM) was generated with significant and independent prognostic value. PAMG significantly improves the characterization of PDAC heterogeneity compared to non-overlapping classifications as validated in 4 independent series of tumors (e.g. 308 consecutive resected PDAC, HR=0.321 95% CI [0.207;0.5] and 60 locally-advanced or metastatic PDAC, HR=0.308 95% CI [0.113;0.836]). The PAMG signature is also associated with progression under mFOLFIRINOX treatment (Pearson correlation to tumor response: -0.67, p-value < 0.001).\n\nCONCLUSIONWe identified a transcriptomic signature (PAMG) that, unlike all other stratification schemas already proposed, classifies PDAC along a continuous gradient. It can be performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples and EUS-guided biopsies showing a strong prognostic value and predicting mFOLFIRINOX responsiveness. We think that PAMG could unify all PDAC preexisting classifications inducing a shift in the actual paradigm of binary classifications towards a better characterization in a gradient.\n\nTrial RegistrationThe PaCaOmics study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov with registration number NCT01692873.

    "abstract": "Adult bone marrow harbors a mosaic of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) clones of embryonic origin, and recent work suggests that such clones may have coherent lineage fates. To probe under physiological conditions whether HSC clones with different fates are transcriptionally distinct, we developed PolyloxExpress - a Cre recombinase-dependent DNA substrate for in situ barcoding that allows parallel readout of barcodes and transcriptomes in single cells. We describe differentiation-inactive, multilineage and lineage-restricted HSC clones, find that they reside in distinct regions of the transcriptional landscape of hematopoiesis, and identify corresponding gene signatures. All clone types contain proliferating HSCs, indicating that differentiation-inactive HSCs can undergo symmetric self-renewal. Our work establishes an approach for studying determinants of stem cell fate in vivo and provides molecular evidence for fate coherence of HSC clones.",

    "abstract": "Global phosphoproteome analysis is crucial for comprehensive and unbiased investigation of kinase-mediated signaling. However, since each phosphopeptide represents a unique entity for defining identity, site-localization, and quantitative changes, phosphoproteomics often suffers from lack of redundancy and statistical power for generating high confidence datasets. Here we developed a phosphoproteomic approach in which data consistency among experiments using reciprocal stable isotope labeling defines a central filtering rule for achieving reliability in phosphopeptide identification and quantitation. We find that most experimental error or biological variation in phosphopeptide quantitation does not revert in quantitation once light and heavy media are swapped between two experimental conditions. Exclusion of non-reverting data-points from the dataset not only reduces quantitation error and variation, but also drastically reduces false positive identifications. Application of our approach in combination with extensive fractionation of phosphopeptides by HILIC identifies new substrates of the Mec1 and Tel1 kinases, expanding our understanding of the DNA damage signaling network regulated by these kinases. Overall, the proposed quantitative phosphoproteomic approach should be generally applicable for investigating kinase signaling networks with high confidence and depth.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteostasis is essential for pancreatic acinar cell function. Under conditions of severe ER stress, activation of pathogenic unfolded protein response pathways play a central role in the development and progression of pancreatitis. A key event in this pathogenic response is a loss of the transcription factor spliced XBP1 (XBP1s) and activation of the PERK pathway. Less is known of the consequence of perturbing ER-associated post-translational protein modification during pancreatitis. Here we show that expression of the ER acetyl-CoA transporter AT-1, necessary for ER protein acetylation, lies downstream of XBP1s and is significantly downregulated during the onset of pancreatitis. Genetic deletion of AT-1 in acinar cells of adult pancreas induces chronic ER stress marked by activation of both the XBP1s and PERK pathways, leading to mild/moderate chronic pancreatitis evidenced by accumulation of intracellular trypsin, immune cell infiltration, and fibrosis, but little pancreatic degeneration. Two-day induction of acute on chronic pancreatitis in AT-1 acinar specific knockout mice results in a severe CP phenotype with pronounced pancreatic atrophy. These findings uncover a new layer of complexity of the pathological ER stress response and its impact on pancreatic disease.",

    "abstract": "While culture is widespread in the animal kingdom, human culture has been claimed to be special due to being cumulative. It is currently debated which cognitive abilities support cumulative culture, but behavioural form copying is one of the main abilities proposed. One important source of contention is the presence or absence of behaviour copying in our closest living relatives, non-human great apes (apes) \u2013 especially given that their behaviour does not show clear signs of cumulation. Those who claim that apes copy behaviour often base this claim on the existence of stable ape cultures in the wild. We developed an individual-based model to test whether ape cultural patterns can emerge in absence of any behaviour copying, when only allowing for a well-supported alternative social learning mechanism, socially mediated reinnovation, where only the frequency of reinnovation is under social influence, but the form of the behaviour is not. Our model reflects wild ape life conditions, including physiological and behavioural needs, demographic and spatial features, and possible genetic and ecological variation between populations. Our results show that, under a wide range of values of parameters, we can reproduce the defining features of wild ape cultural patterns. Overall, our results show that ape cultures can emerge and stabilise without behaviour copying. Ape cultures do not show the signatures of behaviour copying abilities, lending support to the notion that behaviour copying is, among apes, unique in the human lineage. It therefore remains an open question when and why behaviour copying evolved in hominins.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Infection with parasitic copepod salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis, represents one of the most important limitations to sustainable Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) farming today in the North Atlantic region. The parasite exerts negative impact on health, growth and welfare of farmed fish as well as impact on wild salmonid populations. It is therefore central to ensure continuous low level of salmon lice with the least possible handling of the salmon and drug use. To address this, vaccination is a cost-effective and environmentally friendly control approach. In this study, efficacy of a vaccine candidate, containing a peptide derived from ribosomal protein P0, was validated post infestation with L. salmonis, at the lab-scale. The sampling results showed good potential of the vaccine candidate when administered intraperitoneally in the host, in reducing the ectoparasite load, through reduction of adult female lice counts and fecundity and with greater presumptive effect in F1 lice generation. The sampling results correlated well with the differential modulation of pro-inflammatory, Th1, Th2 and T regulatory mediators at the transcript level at different lice stages. Overall, the results supports the effectiveness of the vaccine candidate in controlling salmon lice infestation load. However, further validation is necessary under field conditions.",

    "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome replication requires annealing of a liver specific small-RNA, miR-122 to 2 sites on 5 untranslated region (UTR). Annealing has been reported to a) stabilize the genome, b) promote translation, and c) induce the canonical HCV 5 UTR Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) structure. In this report we identify the relative impact of small RNA annealing on the three functions ascribed to miR-122 and generate a mechanistic model for miR-122 promotion of HCV. First, we identified that perfectly complementary small RNAs that anneal to different locations on the HCV 5 UTR stimulate replication with varying efficiencies and mapped the region on the HCV genome to which small RNA annealing promotes virus replication. Second, by using a panel of small RNAs that promote with varying efficiencies we link HCV replication induction with translation stimulation and 5 UTR RNA structure modifications. However, replication promotion was not linked to genome stabilization since all small RNAs tested could stabilize the viral genome regardless of their ability to promote replication. Thus, we propose that miR-122 annealing promotes HCV replication primarily by activating the HCV IRES and stimulating translation, and that miR-122-induced HCV genome stabilization is insufficient alone but enhances virus replication.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=152 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/008417v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (30K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@178a857org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@741083org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e84743org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9eadd2_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical Abstract C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Atypical antipsychotics are widely used to manage schizophrenia symptoms. However, these drugs can induce deleterious side effects, such as MetS, which are associated with an increased cardiovascular risk to patients. Lipids play a central role in this context, and changes in lipid metabolism have been implicated in schizophrenias pathobiology. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that lipidome changes may be related to antipsychotic treatment response. The aim of this study was to evaluate the lipidome changes in blood plasma samples of schizophrenia patients before and after 6 weeks of treatment with either risperidone, olanzapine, or quetiapine. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis showed changes in the levels of ceramides (Cer), glycerophosphatidic acids (PA), glycerophosphocholines (PC), phosphatidylethanolamines (PE), phosphatidylinositols (PI), glycerophosphoglycerols (PG), and phosphatidylserines (PS) for all treatments. However, the treatment with risperidone also affected diacylglycerides (DG), ceramide 1-phosphates (CerP), triglycerides (TG), sphingomyelins (SM), and ceramide phosphoinositols (PI-Cer). Moreover, specific lipid profiles were observed that could be used to distinguish poor and good responders to the different antipsychotics. As such, further work in this area may lead to lipid-based biomarkers that could be used to improve the clinical management of schizophrenia patients.",

    "abstract": "Enzymes acting on -L-arabinofuranosides have been extensively studied; however, the structures and functions of {beta}-L-arabinofuranosidases are not fully understood. Three enzymes and an ABC transporter in a gene cluster of Bifidobacterium longum JCM 1217 constitute a degradation and import system of {beta}-L-arabinooligosaccharides on plant hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins. An extracellular {beta}-L-arabinobiosidase (HypBA2) belonging to the glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 121 plays a key role in the degradation pathway by releasing {beta}-1,2-linked arabinofuranose disaccharide ({beta}-Ara2) for the specific sugar importer. Here, we present the crystal structure of the catalytic region of HypBA2 as the first three-dimensional structure of GH121 at 1.85 [A] resolution. The HypBA2 structure consists of a central catalytic (/)6 barrel domain and two flanking (N- and C-terminal) {beta}-sandwich domains. A pocket in the catalytic domain appears to be suitable for accommodating the {beta}-Ara2 disaccharide; this pocket is highly conserved among GH121 proteins. The three acidic residues Glu383, Asp515, and Glu713, located in this pocket, are completely conserved among all ~270 members of GH121; site-directed mutagenesis analysis showed that they are essential for catalytic activity. The active site of HypBA2 was compared with those of GH63 -glycosidase, GH94 chitobiose phosphorylase, GH142 {beta}-L-arabinofuranosidase, GH78 -L-rhamnosidase, and GH37 ,-trehalase. Based on these analyses, we concluded that the three conserved residues are essential for catalysis and substrate binding. {beta}-L-Arabinobiosidase genes in GH121 are mainly found in the genomes of bifidobacteria and Xanthomonas species, suggesting that the cleavage and specific import system for the {beta}-Ara2 disaccharide on plant hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins are shared in animal gut symbionts and plant pathogens.",

Unlike previously characterized EBV strains which are either predominantly B-lymphotropic or epitheliotropic, Yu103 evinces an uncanny capacity to infect and transform both B-lymphocytes and nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. Genomic and phylogenetic analyses indicated that Yu103 EBV lies midway along the spectrum of EBV strains known to drive lymphomagenesis or carcinogenesis, and harbors molecular features which likely account for its unusual properties. To our knowledge, Yu103 EBV is currently the only EBV isolate shown to drive human nasopharyngeal carcinoma and B-lymphoma, and should therefore provide a powerful novel platform for research on EBV-driven hematological and epithelial malignancies.",

    "abstract": "The shape and form of the flagellated eukaryotic parasite Leishmania is sculpted to its ecological niches and needs to be transmitted to each generation with great fidelity. The shape of the Leishmania cell is defined by the sub-pellicular microtubule array and the positioning of the nucleus, kinetoplast and the flagellum within this array. The flagellum emerges from the anterior end of the cell body through an invagination of the cell body membrane called the flagellar pocket. Within the flagellar pocket the flagellum is laterally attached to the side of the flagellar pocket by a cytoskeletal structure called the flagellum attachment zone (FAZ). During the cell cycle single copy organelles duplicate with a new flagellum assembling alongside the old flagellum and these are then segregated between the two daughter cells by cytokinesis, which initiates at the anterior cell tip. Here, we have investigated the role of the FAZ in the morphogenetic resolution of the anterior cell tip during cell division. We have deleted the FAZ filament protein, FAZ2 and investigated its function using light and electron microscopy and infection studies. The loss of FAZ2 caused a disruption in membrane organisation at the anterior cell tip, resulting in cells that late in division were connected to each other by a membranous bridge structure between their flagella. These changes had a great impact in vivo with the FAZ2 null mutant unable to develop and proliferate in sand flies and causing a reduced parasite burden in mice. Our study provides a deeper understanding of membrane-cytoskeletal interactions that define the shape and form of an individual cell and the remodelling of that form during cell division.\n\nAuthor summaryLeishmania are parasites that cause leishmaniasis in humans with symptoms ranging from mild cutaneous lesions to severe visceral disease. The life cycle of these parasites alternates between the human host and the sand fly vector, with distinct forms in both. These different forms have different cell shapes that are adapted for survival in these different environments. Leishmania parasites have an elongated cell shape with a flagellum extending from one end and this shape is due to a protein skeleton beneath the cell membrane. This skeleton is made up of different units one of which is called the flagellum attachment zone (FAZ), that connects the flagellum to the cell body. We have found that one of the proteins in the FAZ called FAZ2 is important for generating the shape of the cell at the point where the flagellum exits the cell. When we deleted FAZ2 we found that the cell membrane at the tip of the was distorted resulting in unusual connections between the flagella of different cells. We found that the disruption to the cell shape reduces the ability of the parasite to infect mice and develop in the sand fly, which shows the importance of the parasite shape.",

Sugar meals can reduce blood feeding frequency, enhance survival, and decrease fecundity, as well as provide energetic reserves to fuel energy intensive behaviors such as mating and host seeking.

Few studies have addressed sugar feeding of Aedes albopictus, a vector of arboviruses of public health importance, including dengue and Zika viruses. To address this knowledge gap, we assessed sugar feeding patterns of Ae. albopictus for the first time in its invasive northeastern USA range.\n\nMethodology/ Principal FindingsUsing the cold anthrone fructose assay with robust sample sizes, we demonstrated that a large percentage of both male (49.6%) and female (41.8%) Ae. albopictus fed on plant or homopteran derived sugar sources within 24 hrs of capture. Our results suggest that sugar feeding behavior increases when environmental conditions are dry and may vary by behavioral status (host seeking vs. resting). Furthermore, mosquitoes collected on properties with flowers (>3 blooms) had higher fructose concentrations compared to those collected from properties with few to no flowers (0-3).\n\nConclusions/SignificanceOur results provide the first evidence of Ae. albopictus sugar feeding behavior in the Northeastern US and reveal relatively high rates of sugar feeding. These results suggest the potential success for regional deployment of toxic sugar baits. In addition, we demonstrate the impact of several environmental and mosquito parameters (environmental dryness, presence of flowers, host seeking status, and sex) on sugar feeding. Placing sugar feeding behavior in the context of these environmental and mosquito parameters provides further insight into spatiotemporal dynamics of feeding behavior for Ae. albopictus, and in turn, provides information for evidence-based control decisions.",

    "abstract": "The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) capsid (CA) protein forms a conical lattice around the viral ribonucleoprotein complex (vRNP) consisting of a dimeric viral genome and associated proteins, together constituting the viral core. Upon entry into target cells, the viral core undergoes a process termed uncoating, during which CA molecules are shed from the lattice. Although the timing and degree of uncoating are important for reverse transcription and integration, the molecular basis of this phenomenon remains unclear. Using complementary approaches, we assessed the impact of core destabilization on the intrinsic stability of the CA lattice in vitro and fates of viral core components in infected cells. We found that substitutions in CA can impact the intrinsic stability of the CA lattice in vitro in the absence of vRNPs, which mirrored findings from assessment of CA stability in virions. Altering CA stability tended to increase the propensity to form morphologically aberrant particles, in which the vRNPs were mislocalized between the CA lattice and the viral lipid envelope. Importantly, destabilization of the CA lattice led to premature dissociation of CA from vRNPs in target cells, which was accompanied by proteasomal-independent losses of the viral genome and integrase enzyme. Overall, our studies show that the CA lattice protects the vRNP from untimely degradation in target cells and provide the mechanistic basis of how CA stability influences reverse transcription.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) capsid (CA) protein forms a conical lattice around the viral RNA genome and the associated viral enzymes and proteins, together constituting the viral core. Upon infection of a new cell, viral cores are released into the cytoplasm where they undergo a process termed \"uncoating\", i.e. shedding of CA molecules from the conical lattice. Although proper and timely uncoating has been shown to be important for reverse transcription, the molecular mechanisms that link these two events remain poorly understood. In this study, we show that destabilization of the CA lattice leads to premature dissociation of CA from viral cores, which exposes the viral genome and the integrase enzyme for degradation in target cells. Thus, our studies demonstrate that the CA lattice protects the viral ribonucleoprotein complexes from untimely degradation in target cells and provide the first causal link between how CA stability affects reverse transcription.",

    "abstract": "With increasing medical radiation exposures, it is important to understand how different modes of delivery of ionizing radiation as well as total doses of exposure impact health outcomes. Our lab studied the risks associated with ionizing radiation by analyzing the Northwestern University Radiation Archive for animals (NURA). NURA contains detailed data from a series of 10 individual neutron and gamma irradiation experiments conducted on over 50,000 mice. Rigorous statistical testing on control mice from all Janus experiments enabled us to select studies that could be compared to one another and uncover unexpected differences among the controls as well as experimental animals. For controls, mice sham irradiated with 300 fractions died significantly earlier than those with fewer sham fractions. Using the integrated dataset of gamma irradiated and control mice, we found that fractionation significantly decreased the death hazard for animals dying of lymphomas, tumors, non-tumors, and unknown causes. Gender differences in frequencies of causes of death were identified irrespective of irradiation and dose fractionation, with female mice being at a greater risk for all causes of death, except for lung tumors. Irradiated and control male mice were at a significantly greater risk for lung tumors, the opposite from observations noted in humans. Additionally, we discovered that lymphoma deaths can occur quickly after exposures to high doses of gamma rays. This study systematically cross-compared outcomes of different modes of fractionation across a wide span of total doses to demonstrate that protraction modulated survival and disease status differently based on the total dose, cause of death, and sex of an animal. This novel method for analyzing the Janus datasets will lead to insightful new mechanistic hypotheses and research in the fields of radiation biology and protection.",

Methanotrophic bacteria play a key role in Earths methane (CH4) cycle by removing atmospheric CH4 and reducing emissions from methanogenesis in wetlands and landfills. Here, we used a dilution-to-extinction approach to simulate diversity loss in a methanotrophic landfill cover soil community. Combining analyses of CH4 flux and community structure, we found a linear decrease of CH4 oxidation rates with the number of taxonomic units lost. This effect was independent of community size, consistent over the three-month study, and occurred in relatively diverse communities, challenging the notion of high functional redundancy mediating high resistance to diversity erosion in natural microbial systems.

However, the dietary requirement of this mineral is variable among fish species and the growth stages. Thus, this study aimed to determine the digestible P (dP) requirement for tambaqui in the initial growth stage ({+/-} 17 to 150g) using growth data, mineralization of the whole body, vertebrae and scales, as well as blood chemistry as response parameters. A total of 192 tambaqui juveniles of approximately 17 {+/-} 0.85 g were stocked into a water recirculation system. Fish were assigned to 24 70L-tanks using randomized block design (two floors) with six treatments (1.3, 2.4, 4.8, 6.3, 7.8 and 8.8 g kg-1 dP) and four replicates. Fish were fed six semipurified diets with increasing levels of dP for 90 days. The dietary requirement of P was estimated using regression models (P < 0.05). Duncan and SNK multiple range tests were used when regression models were not fitted. No mortality or apparent signs of P deficiency were observed. All performance variables were improved with increasing levels of dP in the diet. Based on weight gain, the P requirement was 6.3g kg-1 diet while for increased carcass mineral deposition was 6.6g kg-1 diet and for adequate mineralization of vertebrae the requirement was 4.75 g dP kg-1 diet. The blood chemistry parameters were greatly affected by the dietary P level, except for serum calcium. Thus, the dietary dP requirement for tambaqui juveniles in the early stage was 6.3 g kg-1 diet based on growth and bone mineralization.",

Using a new approach to utilize experimental controls to determine whether a cross comparison between experiments was appropriate, we amalgamated data on neutron exposures to discover that fractionation significantly improved overall survival. A more detailed investigation showed that fractionation only had a significant impact on the death hazard for animals that died from solid tumors, but did not significantly impact any other causes of death. Additionally, we compared the effects of sex, age first irradiated, and radiation fractionation on neutron irradiated mice versus cobalt 60 gamma irradiated mice and found that solid tumors were the most common cause of death in neutron irradiated mice, while lymphomas were the dominant cause of death in gamma irradiated mice. Most animals in this study were irradiated before 150 days of age but a subset of mice was first exposed to gamma or neutron irradiation over 500 days of age. Advanced age played a significant role in decreasing the death hazard for neutron irradiated mice, but not for gamma irradiated mice. Mice that were 500 days old before their first exposures to neutrons began dying later than both sham irradiated or gamma irradiated mice.",

    "abstract": "Evolution by natural selection may be effective enough to allow for recurrent, rapid adaptation to distinct niche environments within a well-mixed population. For this to occur, selection must act on standing genetic variation such that mortality i.e. genetic load, is minimized while polymorphism is maintained. Selection on multiple, redundant loci of small effect provides a potentially inexpensive solution. Yet, demonstrating adaptation via redundant, polygenic selection in the wild remains extremely challenging because low per-locus effect sizes and high genetic redundancy severely reduce statistical power. One approach to facilitate identification of loci underlying polygenic selection is to harness natural replicate populations experiencing similar selection pressures that harbor high within-, yet negligible among-population genetic variation. Such populations can be found among the teleost Fundulus heteroclitus. F. heteroclitus inhabits salt marsh estuaries that are characterized by high environmental heterogeneity e.g. tidal ponds, creeks, coastal basins. Here, we sample four of these heterogeneous niches (one coastal basin and three replicate tidal ponds) at two time points from among a single, panmictic F. heteroclitus population. We identify 10,861 single nucleotide polymorphisms using a genotyping-by-sequencing approach and quantify temporal allele frequency change within, as well as spatial divergence among subpopulations residing in these niches. We find a significantly elevated number of concordant allele frequency changes among all subpopulations, suggesting ecosystem-wide adaptation to a common selection pressure. Remarkably, we also find an unexpected number of temporal allele frequency changes that generate fine-scale divergence among subpopulations, suggestive of local adaptation to distinct niche environments. Both patterns are characterized by a lack of large-effect loci yet an elevated total number of significant loci. Adaptation via redundant, polygenic selection offers a likely explanation for these patterns as well as a potential mechanism for polymorphism maintenance in the F. heteroclitus system.\n\nAuthor SummaryEvolution by adaptation to local environmental conditions may occur more rapidly than previously thought. Recent studies show that natural selection is extremely effective when acting on, not one, but multiple genetic variants that are already present in a population. Here, we show that polygenic selection can lead to adaptation within a single generation by studying a wild, well-mixed population of mud minnows inhabiting environmentally distinct locations or niches (i.e. tidal ponds and coastal basins). We monitor allele proportions at over 10,000 genetic variants over time within a single generation and find a significant number to be changing substantially in every niche, suggestive of natural selection. We further demonstrate this genetic change to be non-random, generating mild, yet significant divergence between residents inhabiting distinct niches, indicative of local adaptation. We corroborate a previous study which discovered similar genetic divergence among niches during a different year, suggesting that local adaptation via natural selection occurs every generation. We show polygenic selection on standing genetic variation to be an effective and evolutionarily inexpensive mechanism, allowing organisms to rapidly adapt to their environments even at extremely short time scales. Our study provides valuable insights into the rate of evolution and the ability of organisms to respond to environmental change.",

The purpose of this study was developing a new AFM-based method to articular rabbit cartilage roughness measurement, followed by an investigation of whether platelet-rich plasma therapy of knee osteoarthritis has a positive impact on mechanical properties of rabbit cartilage. The rabbits were randomly divided into two groups: the control group (N=6) and the patients (N=12). Saline (0.5 ml) and 10% surgical talc solution were injected into the right knee of 12 rabbits to induce osteoarthritis. Six rabbits underwent PRP therapy, while the other six did not receive treatment. The mechanical properties and the submicron surface morphology rabbit hyaline cartilage were investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM). In the group of specimens worn out by induced osteoarthritis, the maximum arithmetic average of absolute values (Ra) change was a 23% increase; the maximum peak height (Rp) increased by over 100%, while the mean spacing between local peaks (S) increased by 26%, compared to healthy rabbit cartilage (p<0.05). In the group of specimens worn out by induced osteoarthritis and cured with PRP therapy, Ra increased by 13%; Rp increased by 33%, while S decreased by 77%, compared to healthy rabbit cartilage (p<0.05). It was found that the mechanical properties of hyaline cartilage deteriorate under the influence of simulated osteoarthritis. The results of PRP treatment in rabbits may constitute a step forward to further relevant studies involving OA patients.",

    "abstract": "Extant protein-coding sequences span a huge range of ages, from those that emerged only recently in particular lineages, to those present in the last universal common ancestor. Because evolution has had less time to act on young sequences, there might be \"phylostratigraphy\" trends in any properties that evolve slowly with age. Indeed, a long-term reduction in hydrophobicity and in hydrophobic clustering has been found in previous, taxonomically restricted studies. Here we perform integrated phylostratigraphy across 435 fully sequenced and dated eukaryotic species, using sensitive HMM methods to detect homology of protein domains (which may vary in age within the same gene), and applying a variety of quality filters. We find that the reduction in hydrophobic clustering is universal across diverse lineages, showing limited sign of saturation. But the tendency for young domains to have higher protein structural disorder, driven primarily by more hydrophilic amino acids, is found only among young animal domains, and not young plant domains, nor ancient domains predating the existence of the last eukaryotic common ancestor. Among ancient domains, trends in amino acid composition reflect the order of recruitment into the genetic code, suggesting that events during the earliest stages of life on earth continue to have an impact on the composition of ancient sequences.",

    "abstract": "The inflammatory response plays an important role in cholestatic liver injury where bile acid (BA) induction of proinflammatory cytokines in hepatocytes is an initial pathophysiologic event. However, the signaling pathways involving BA stimulation of cytokine production remain to be elucidated. In this report, we examined the functional role of the Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells (NFAT) in BA-induction of inflammatory genes in hepatic cells and cholestatic livers. We found that NFAT isoform c1 and c3 were expressed in human and mouse hepatocytes. When treated with cholestatic levels of BA, both human and mouse hepatocytes but not cholangiocytes increased NFATc3 nuclear translocation, associated with elevated mRNA levels of IL-8, Cxcl2, and Cxcl10 in these cells. Blocking NFAT activation with pathway-specific inhibitors (i.e. cyclosporine A, FK-506, KN-62 and Inca-6) or knocking down Nfatc3, significantly repressed BA-induction of these cytokines in mouse hepatocytes, including Ccl2, Cxcl2, Cxcl10, Icam1 and Egr1. Nuclear expression of NFATc3/Nfatc3 protein was also increased in cholestatic livers after bile duct ligation or in Abcb4-/- mice and in patients with primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis in association with tissue elevations of Cxcl2 and IL-8. Gene reporter assays and ChIP-PCR demonstrated that the NFAT response element in its promoter played a key role in BA-induced human IL-8 expression. Together our findings indicate that NFAT plays an important role in BA stimulation of hepatic cytokines in cholestasis and is a mechanism that may provide novel targets to reduce cholestatic liver injury.",

    "abstract": "Using The Virtual Brain (TVB, thevirtualbrian.org) simulation platform, we explored for 50 individual adult human brains (ages 18-80), how personalized connectome based brain network modelling captures various empirical observations as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG). We compare simulated activity based on individual structural connectomes (SC) inferred from diffusion weighted imaging with fMRI and EEG in the resting state. We systematically explore the role of the following model parameters: conduction velocity, global coupling and graph theoretical features of individual SC. First, a subspace of the parameter space is identified for each subject that results in realistic brain activity, i.e. reproducing the following prominent features of empirical EEG-fMRI activity: topology of resting-state fMRI functional connectivity (FC), functional connectivity dynamics (FCD), electrophysiological oscillations in the delta (3-4 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) frequency range and their bimodality, i.e. low and high energy modes. Interestingly, FCD fit, bimodality and static FC fit are highly correlated. They all show their optimum in the same range of global coupling. In other words, only when our local model is in a bistable regime we are able to generate switching of modes in our global network. Second, our simulations reveal the explicit network mechanisms that lead to electrophysiological oscillations, their bimodal behaviour and inter-regional differences. Third, we discuss biological interpretability of the Stefanescu-Jirsa-Hindmarsh-Rose-3D model when embedded inside the large-scale brain network and mechanisms underlying the emergence of bimodality of the neural signal.\n\nWith the present study, we set the cornerstone for a systematic catalogue of spatiotemporal brain activity regimes generated with the connectome-based brain simulation platform The Virtual Brain.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn order to understand brain dynamics we use numerical simulations of brain network models. Combining the structural backbone of the brain, that is the white matter fibres connecting distinct regions in the grey matter, with dynamical systems describing the activity of neural populations we are able to simulate brain function on a large scale. In order to make accurate prediction with this network, it is crucial to determine optimal model parameters. We here use an explorative approach to adjust model parameters to individual brain activity, showing that subjects have their own optimal point in the parameter space, depending on their brain structure and function. At the same time, we investigate the relation between bistable phenomena on the scale of neural populations and the changed in functional connectivity on the brain network scale. Our results are important for future modelling approaches trying to make accurate predictions of brain function.",

    "abstract": "The gamma rhythm has been implicated in neuronal communication, but causal evidence remains indirect. We measured spike output of local neuronal networks and emulated their synaptic input through optogenetics. Opsins provide currents through somato-dendritic membranes, similar to synapses, yet under experimental control with high temporal precision. We expressed Channelrhodopsin-2 in excitatory neurons of cat visual cortex and recorded neuronal responses to light with different temporal characteristics. Sine waves of different frequencies entrained neuronal responses with a reliability that peaked for input frequencies in the gamma band. Crucially, we also presented white-noise sequences, because their temporal unpredictability enables analysis of causality. Neuronal spike output was caused specifically by the inputs gamma component. This gamma-specific transfer function is likely an emergent property of in-vivo networks with feedback inhibition. The method described here could reveal the transfer function between the input to any one and the output of any other neuronal group.",

    "abstract": "Sharing deep neural networks and testing the performance of trained networks typically involves a major initial commitment towards one algorithm, before knowing how the network will perform on a different dataset. Here we release a free online tool, CDeep3M-Preview, that allows end-users to rapidly test the performance of any of the pre-trained neural network models hosted on the CIL-CDeep3M modelzoo. This feature makes part of a set of complementary strategies we employ to facilitate sharing, increase reproducibility and enable quicker insights into biology. Namely we: (1) provide CDeep3M deep learning image segmentation software through cloud applications (Colab and AWS) and containerized installations (Docker and Singularity) (2) co-hosting trained deep neural networks with the relevant microscopy images and (3) providing a CDeep3M-Preview feature, enabling quick tests of trained networks on user provided test data or any of the publicly hosted large datasets. The CDeep3M-modelzoo and the cellimagelibrary.org are open for contributions of both, trained models as well as image datasets by the community and all services are free of charge.",
