    "abstract": "Gene and protein expression displays circadian oscillations in numerous body organs. These oscillations can be disrupted in diseases, thus contributing to the disease pathology. Whether the molecular architecture of cortical brain regions oscillates daily and whether these oscillations are modified in brain disorders is less understood. We identified 1200 daily oscillating transcripts in the hippocampus of control mice. More transcripts (1600) were oscillating in experimental epilepsy, with only one fourth oscillating in both conditions. Proteomics confirmed these results. Metabolic activity and targets of antiepileptic drugs displayed different circadian regulation in control and epilepsy. Hence, the hippocampus, and perhaps other cortical regions, shows a daily remapping of its molecular landscape, which would enable different functioning modes during the night/day cycle. The impact of this remapping in brain pathologies needs to be taken into account not only to study their mechanisms, but also to design drug treatments and time their delivery.",

    "abstract": "In complex trait genetics, the ability to predict phenotype from genotype is the ultimate measure of our understanding of genetic architecture underlying the heritability of a trait. A complete understanding of the genetic basis of a trait should allow for predictive methods with accuracies approaching the traits heritability. The highly polygenic nature of quantitative traits and most common phenotypes has motivated the development of statistical strategies focused on combining myriad individually non-significant genetic effects. Now that predictive accuracies are improving, there is a growing interest in practical utility of such methods for predicting risk of common diseases responsive to early therapeutic intervention. However, existing methods require individual level genotypes or depend on accurately specifying the genetic architecture underlying each disease to be predicted. Here, we propose a polygenic risk prediction method that does not require explicitly modeling any underlying genetic architecture. We start with summary statistics in the form of SNP effect sizes from a large GWAS cohort. We then remove the correlation structure across summary statistics arising due to linkage disequilibrium and apply a piecewise linear interpolation on conditional mean effects. In both simulated and real datasets, this new non-parametric shrinkage (NPS) method can reliably allow for linkage disequilibrium in summary statistics of 5 million dense genome-wide markers and consistently improves prediction accuracy. We show that NPS improves the identification of groups at high risk for Breast Cancer, Type 2 Diabetes, Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Coronary Heart Disease, all of which have available early intervention or prevention treatments.",

    "abstract": "Neurofeedback (NF) allows to exert self-regulation over specific aspects of ones own brain activity by returning information extracted in real-time from brain activity measures. These measures are usually acquired from a single modality, most commonly electroencephalography (EEG) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). EEG-fMRI-neurofeedback (EEG-fMRI-NF) is a new approach that consists in providing a NF based simultaneously on EEG and fMRI signals. By exploiting the complementarity of these two modalities, EEG-fMRI-NF opens a new spectrum of possibilities for defining bimodal NF targets that could be more robust, flexible and effective than unimodal ones. Since EEG-fMRI-NF allows for a richer amount of information to be fed back, the question arises of how to represent the EEG and fMRI features simultaneously in order to allow the subject to achieve better self-regulation. In this work, we propose to represent EEG and fMRI features in a single bimodal feedback (integrated feedback). We introduce two integrated feedback strategies for EEG-fMRI-NF and compare their early effects on a motor imagery task with a between-group design. The BiDim group (n=10) was shown a two-dimensional (2D) feedback in which each dimension depicted the information from one modality. The UniDim group (n=10) was shown a one-dimensional (1D) feedback that integrated both types of information even further by merging them into one. Online fMRI activations were significantly higher in the UniDim group than in the BiDim group, which suggests that the 1D feedback is easier to control than the 2D feedback. However subjects from the BiDim group produced more specific BOLD activations with a notably stronger activation in the right superior parietal lobe (BiDim > UniDim, p < 0.001, uncorrected). These results suggest that the 2D feedback encourages subjects to explore their strategies to recruit more specific brain patterns. To summarize, our study shows that 1D and 2D integrated feedbacks are effective but also appear to be complementary and could therefore be used in a bimodal NF training program. Altogether, our study paves the way to novel integrated feedback strategies for the development of flexible and effective bimodal NF paradigms that fully exploits bimodal information and are adapted to clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "How do endogenous (voluntary) and exogenous (involuntary) attention modulate activity in visual cortex? Using ROI-based fMRI analysis, we measured fMRI activity for valid and invalid trials (target at cued/un-cued location, respectively), pre- or post-cueing endogenous or exogenous attention, while participants performed the same orientation discrimination task. We found stronger modulation in contralateral than ipsilateral visual regions, and higher activity in valid-than invalid-trials. For endogenous attention, modulation of stimulus-evoked activity due to a pre-cue increased along the visual hierarchy, but was constant due to a post-cue. For exogenous attention, modulation of stimulus-evoked activity due to a pre-cue was constant along the visual hierarchy, but was not modulated due to a post-cue. These findings reveal that endogenous and exogenous attention distinctly modulate activity in visuo-occipital areas during orienting and reorienting; endogenous attention facilitates both the encoding and the readout of visual information whereas exogenous attention only facilitates the encoding of information.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how and why rates of evolutionary diversification vary is a key issue in evolutionary biology, ecology, and biogeography, and the metaphorical concepts of adaptive radiation and evolutionary stasis describe two opposing aspects causing variation in diversification rates. Here we review the central concepts in the evolutionary diversification literature and synthesize these into a simple, general framework for studying rates of diversification and quantifying their underlying dynamics, which can be applied across clades and regions and across spatial and temporal scales. Our framework describes the diversification rate (d) as a function of the abiotic environment (a), the biotic environment (b) and clade-specific phenotypes or traits (c); thus d[~]a,b,c. We refer to the four components (a-d) and their interactions collectively as the  Evolutionary Arena. We outline analytical approaches to this framework and present a case study on conifers, for which we parameterise the general model. We also discuss three conceptual examples: the Lupinus radiation in the Andes in the context of emerging ecological opportunity and fluctuating connectivity due to climatic oscillations; oceanic island radiations in the context of island formation and erosion; and biotically driven radiations of the Mediterranean orchid genus Ophrys. The results of the conifer case study are consistent with the long-standing scenario that low competition and high rates of niche evolution promote diversification. The conceptual examples illustrate how using the synthetic Evolutionary Arena framework helps to identify and structure future directions for research on evolutionary radiations. In this way, the Evolutionary Arena framework promotes a more general understanding of variation in evolutionary rates by making quantitative results comparable between case studies, thereby allowing new syntheses of evolutionary and ecological processes to emerge.",

    "abstract": "Identification of early processes leading to complex tissue pathologies, such as inflammatory bowel diseases, poses a major scientific and clinical challenge that is imperative for improved diagnosis and treatment. Most studies of inflammation onset focus on cellular processes and signaling molecules, while overlooking the environment in which they take place, the continuously remodeled extracellular matrix. In this study, we used colitis models for investigating extracellular-matrix dynamics during disease onset, while treating the matrix as a complete and defined entity. Through the analysis of matrix structure, stiffness and composition, we unexpectedly revealed that even prior to the first clinical symptoms, the colon displays its own unique extracellular-matrix signature and found specific markers of clinical potential, which were also validated in human subjects. We also show that the emergence of this pre-symptomatic matrix is mediated by sub-clinical infiltration of neutrophils and monocytes bearing remodeling enzymes. Remarkably, whether the inflammation is chronic or acute, its matrix signature converges at pre-symptomatic states. We suggest that the existence of a pre-symptomatic extracellular-matrix is general and relevant to a wide range of diseases.",

    "abstract": "Trends in time series generated by physiological control systems are ubiquitous. Determining whether trends arise from intrinsic system dynamics or originate outside of the system is a fundamental problem of fractal series analysis. In the latter case, it is necessary to filter out the trends before attempting to quantify correlations in the noise (residuals). For over two decades, detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) has been used to calculate scaling exponents of stride time (ST), stride length (SL), and stride speed (SS) of human gait. Herein, rather than relying on the very specific form of detrending characteristic of DFA, we adopt Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) to explicitly determine trends in spatio-temporal gait parameters during treadmill walking. Then, we use the madogram estimator to calculate the scaling exponent of the corresponding MARS residuals. The durations of ST and SL trends are determined to be independent of treadmill speed and have distributions with exponential tails. At all speeds considered, the trends of ST and SL are strongly correlated and are statistically independent of their corresponding residuals. The group-averaged values of scaling exponents of ST and ST MARS residuals are slightly smaller than 0.5, indicating weak anti-persistence. Thus, contrary to the interpretation prevalent in the literature, the statistical properties of ST and SL time series originate from the superposition of large scale trends and small scale fluctuations. We show that trends serve as the control manifolds about which ST and SL fluctuate. Moreover, the trend speed, defined as the ratio of instantaneous values of SL and ST trends, is tightly controlled about the treadmill speed. The strong coupling between the ST and SL trends ensures that the concomitant changes of their values correspond to movement along the constant speed goal equivalent manifold as postulated by Dingwell et al. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000856.\n\nAuthor summaryDuring treadmill walking, the subjects stride time (ST) and stride length (SL) must yield a stride speed which can fluctuate over a narrow range centered on the treadmill belts speed. The fact that both ST and SL are persistent is an intriguing property of human gait. For persistent fluctuations any deviation from the mean value is likely to be followed by a deviation in the same direction. To trace the origin of such persistence, we used a novel approach to determine trends in spatio-temporal gait parameters. We find that the trends of ST and SL of a subject are strongly correlated and are statistically independent of their corresponding residuals. Moreover, the trend speed, defined as the ratio of instantaneous values of SL and ST trends, is tightly controlled about the treadmill speed. The persistence of gait parameters stems from superposition of large scale trends and small scale fluctuations.",

    "abstract": "Listeners perceive sound-energy as originating from the direction of its source, even as direct sound is followed milliseconds later by reflected sound from multiple different directions. Early-arriving sound is emphasised in the ascending auditory pathway, including the medial superior olive (MSO) where binaural neurons encode the interaural time difference (ITD) cue for spatial location. Behaviourally, weighting of ITD conveyed during rising sound-energy is stronger at 600 Hz, a frequency with higher reverberant energy, than at 200 Hz where reverberant energy is lower. Here we computationally explore the combined effectiveness of adaptation before ITD-encoding, and excitatory binaural coincidence detection within MSO neurons, in emphasising ITD conveyed in early-arriving sound. With excitatory inputs from adapting model spherical bushy cells (SBCs) of the bilateral cochlear nuclei, a Hodgkin-Huxley-type model MSO neuron reproduces the frequency-dependent emphasis of rising vs. peak sound-energy in ITD-encoding. Maintaining the adaptation in model SBCs, and adjusting membrane speed in model MSO neurons, hemispheric populations of model SBCs and MSO neurons, with simplified membranes for computational efficiency, also reproduce the stronger weighting of ITD information conveyed during rising sound-energy at 600 Hz compared to 200 Hz. This hemispheric model further demonstrates a link between strong weighting of spatial information during rising sound-energy, and correct unambiguous lateralisation of reverberant speech.",

    "abstract": "Under normal conditions, cells of almost all tissue types express the same predominant canonical transcript isoform at each gene locus. In cancer, however, splicing regulation is often disturbed, leading to cancer-specific switches in the most dominant transcripts (MDT). But what is the pathogenic impact of these switches and how are they driving oncogenesis? To address these questions, we have analyzed isoform-specific protein-protein interaction disruptions in 1209 cancer samples covering 27 different cancer types from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) project of the International Cancer Genomics Consortium (ICGC). Our study revealed large variations in the number of cancer-specific MDT (cMDT) between cancer types. While carcinomas of the head and neck, or brain, had none or only a few cMDT, cancers of the female reproduction organs showed the highest number of cMDT. Interestingly, in contrast to the mutational load, the number of cMDT was tissue-specific, i.e. cancers arising from the same primary tissue had a similar number of cMDT. Some cMDT were found in 100% of all samples in a cancer type, making them candidates for diagnostic biomarkers. cMDT showed a tendency to fall at densely populated network regions where they disrupted protein interactions in the proximity of pathogenic cancer genes. A gene ontology enrichment analysis showed that these disruptions occurred mostly in enzyme signaling, protein translation, and RNA splicing pathways. Interestingly, no significant correlation between the number of cMDT and the number of coding or non-coding mutations could be identified. However, some transcript expressions correlated with mutations in non-coding splice-site and promoter regions of their genes. This work demonstrates for the first time the large extent of cancer-specific alterations in alternative splicing for 27 different cancer types. It highlights distinct and common patterns of cMDT and suggests novel pathogenic transcripts and markers that induce large network disruptions in cancers.",

At adulthood, the rat offspring were housed in four cohorts of 4 females and 4 males in a seminatural environment. As prosocial behaviors are more prominent after stressful situations, we investigated the behavioral response of rats immediately after natural aggressive encounters (fights). Additionally, we studied whether a stressful white-noise exposure would alter this response to the aggressive encounters.\n\nOur study indicates that CTR-female rats are able to show third party prosocial behavior in response to witnessing aggressive encounters between conspecifics in a seminatural environment. In addition, we showed that perinatal FLX exposure impairs the display of prosocial behavior in female rats. Moreover, we found no signs of prosocial behavior in CTR- and FLX-males after natural aggressive encounters. After white-noise exposure the effects in third party prosocial behavior of CTR-females ceased to exist. We conclude that female rats are able to show prosocial behavior, possibly in the form of consolation behavior. In addition, the negative effects of perinatal fluoxetine exposure on prosocial behavior could provide additional evidence that SSRI treatment during pregnancy could contribute to the risk for social impairments in the offspring.",

    "abstract": "DNA inter-strand crosslink (ICL) repair requires a complicated network of DNA damage response pathways. Removal of these lesions is vital as they are physical barriers to essential DNA processes that require the separation of duplex DNA, such as replication and transcription. The Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway is the principle mechanism for ICL repair in metazoans and is coupled to replication. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a degenerate FA pathway is present, but ICLs are predominantly repaired by a pathway involving the Pso2 nuclease that is hypothesized to digest through the lesion to provide access for translesion polymerases. However, Pso2 lacks translesion nuclease activity in vitro, and mechanistic details of this pathway are lacking, especially relative to FA. We recently identified the Hrq1 helicase, a homolog of the disease-linked RECQL4, as a novel component of Pso2- mediated ICL repair. Here, we show that Hrq1 stimulates the Pso2 nuclease in a mechanism that requires Hrq1 catalytic activity. Importantly, Hrq1 also stimulates Pso2 translesion nuclease activity through a site- specific ICL in vitro. Stimulation of Pso2 nuclease activity is specific to eukaryotic RecQ4 subfamily helicases, and Hrq1 likely interacts with Pso2 through their N-terminal domains. These results advance our understanding of FA-independent ICL repair and establish a role for the RecQ4 helicases in the repair of these dangerous lesions.",

    "abstract": "The cytoskeleton is formed by three types of filamentous proteins - microtubules, actin filaments, and intermediate filaments (IFs) - and enables cells to withstand external and internal forces. Vimentin is the most abundant IF protein in humans and assembles into 10 nm diameter filaments with remarkable mechanical properties, such as high extensibility and stability. It is, however, unclear to which extent these properties are influenced by the electrostatic environment. Here, we study the mechanical properties of single vimentin filaments by employing optical trapping combined with microfluidics. Force-strain curves, recorded at varying ion concentrations and pH values, reveal that the mechanical properties of single vimentin IFs are influenced by pH and ion concentration. By combination with Monte Carlo simulations, we relate these altered mechanics to electrostatic interactions of subunits within the filaments. We thus suggest possible mechanisms that allow cells to locally tune their stiffness without remodeling the entire cytoskeleton.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary acini represent the functional gas-exchanging units of the lung. Due to technical limitations, individual acini cannot be identified on microscopic lung sections. To overcome these limitations, we imaged the right lower lobes of instillation-fixed rat lungs from postnatal days P4, P10, P21, and P60 at the TOMCAT beamline of the Swiss Light Source synchrotron facility at a voxel size of 1.48 m. Individual acini were segmented from the three-dimensional data by closing the airways at the transition from conducting to gas exchanging airways. For a subset of acini (N=268), we followed the acinar development by stereologically assessing their volume and their number of alveoli. We found that the mean volume of the acini increases 23 times during the observed time-frame. The coeffcients of variation dropped from 1.26 to 0.49 and the difference between the mean volumes of the fraction of the 20 % smallest to the 20 % largest acini decreased from a factor of 27.26 (day 4) to a factor of 4.07 (day 60), i.e. shows a smaller dispersion at later time points. The acinar volumes show a very large variation early in lung development and homogenize during maturation of the lung by reducing their size distribution by a factor of 7 until adulthood. The homogenization of the acinar sizes hints at an optimization of the gas-exchange region in the lungs of adult animals and that acini of different size are not evenly distributed in the lungs. This likely leads to more homogeneous ventilation at later stages in lung development.",

The emergence of favorable adaptive characteristics is accelerated in agricultural pathogens due to the unique properties of agro-ecosystems. We performed a QST - FST comparison using 164 strains of Parastagonospora nodorum sampled from eight global field populations to disentangle the predominant evolutionary forces driving population divergence in a wheat pathogen. We used digital image analysis to obtain quantitative measurements of growth rate and melanization at different temperatures and under different fungicide concentrations in a common garden experiment. FST measures were based on complete genome sequences obtained for all 164 isolates. Our analyses indicated that all measured traits were under selection. Growth rates at 18{degrees}C and 24{degrees}C were under stabilizing selection (QST < FST), while diversifying selection (QST > FST) was the predominant evolutionary force affecting growth under fungicide and high temperature stress. Stabilizing selection (QST < FST) was the predominant force affecting melanization across the different environments. Melanin production increased at 30{degrees}C but was negatively correlated with higher growth rates, consistent with a trade-off under heat stress. Our results demonstrate that global populations of P. nodorum possess significant evolutionary potential to adapt to changing local conditions, including warmer temperatures and applications of fungicides.",

    "abstract": "Coordination of fate transition and cell division is crucial to maintain the plant architecture and to achieve efficient production of plant organs. In this paper, we analysed the stem cell dynamics at the shoot apical meristem (SAM) that is one of the plant stem cells locations. We designed a mathematical model to elucidate the impact of hormonal signaling on the fate transition rates between different zones corresponding to slowly dividing stem cells and fast dividing transit amplifying cells. The model is based on a simplified two-dimensional disc geometry of the SAM and accounts for a continuous displacement towards the periphery of cells produced in the central zone. Coupling growth and hormonal signaling results in a non-linear system of reaction-diffusion equations on a growing domain with the growth velocity depending on the model components. The model is tested by simulating perturbations in the level of key transcription factors that maintain SAM homeostasis. The model provides new insights on how the transcription factor HECATE is integrated in the regulatory network that governs stem cell differentiation.\n\nSummaryPlants continuously generate new organs such as leaves, roots and flowers. This process is driven by stem cells which are located in specialized regions, so-called meristems. Dividing stem cells give rise to offspring that, during a process referred to as cell fate transition, become more specialized and give rise to organs. Plant architecture and crop yield crucially depend on the regulation of meristem dynamics. To better understand this regulation, we develop a computational model of the shoot meristem. The model describes the meristem as a two-dimensional disk that can grow and shrink over time, depending on the concentrations of the signalling factors in its interior. This allows studying how the non-linear interaction of multiple transcription factors is linked to cell division and fate-transition. We test the model by simulating perturbations of meristem signals and comparing them to experimental data. The model allows simulating different hypotheses about signal effects. Based on the model we study the specific role of the transcription factor HECATE and provide new insights in its action on cell dynamics and in its interrelation with other known transcription factors in the meristem.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid zones, where distinct populations meet and interbreed, give insight into how differences between populations are maintained despite gene flow. Studying clines in genetic loci and adaptive traits across hybrid zones is a powerful method for understanding how selection drives differentiation within a single species, but can also be used to compare parallel divergence in different species responding to a common selective pressure. Here, we study parallel divergence of wing colouration in the butterflies Heliconius erato and H. melpomene, which are distantly related Mullerian mimics that show parallel geographic variation in both discrete variation in pigmentation, and quantitative variation in structural colour. Using geographic cline analysis, we show that clines in these traits are positioned in the roughly the same geographic region for both species, which is consistent with direct selection for mimicry. However, the width of the clines varies markedly between species. This difference is explained in part by variation in the strength of selection acting on colour traits within each species, but may also be influenced by differences in the dispersal rate and total strength of selection against hybrids between the species. Genotyping-by-sequencing also revealed weaker population structure in H. melpomene, suggesting the hybrid zones may have evolved differently in each species; which may also contribute to the patterns of phenotypic divergence in this system Overall, we conclude that multiple factors are needed to explain patterns of clinal variation within and between these species, although mimicry has probably played a central role.",

    "abstract": "Experiments comparing native to introduced populations or distinct introduced populations to each other show that phenotypic evolution is common and often involves a suit of interacting phenotypic traits. We define such sets of traits that evolve in concert and contribute to the success of invasive populations as an  invasion syndrome. The invasive Harlequin ladybird Harmonia axyridis displays such an invasion syndrome with, for instance, females from invasive populations being larger and heavier than individuals from native populations, allocating more resources to reproduction, and spreading reproduction over a longer lifespan. Invasion syndromes could emerge due to selection acting jointly and directly on a multitude of traits, or due to selection on one or a few key traits that drive correlated indirect responses in other traits. Here, we investigated the degree to which the H. axyridis invasion syndrome would emerge in response to artificial selection on either female body mass or on age at first reproduction, two traits involved in their invasion syndrome. To further explore the interaction between environmental context and evolutionary change in molding the phenotypic response, we phenotyped the individuals from the selection experiments in two environments, one with abundant food resources and one with limited resources. The two artificial selection experiments show that the number of traits showing a correlated response depends upon the trait undergoing direct selection. Artificial selection on female body mass resulted in few correlated responses and hence poorly reproduced the invasion syndrome. In contrast, artificial selection on age at first reproduction resulted in more widespread phenotypic changes, which nevertheless corresponded only partly to the invasion syndrome. The artificial selection experiments also revealed a large impact of diet on the traits, with effects dependent on the trait considered and the selection regime. Overall, our results indicate that direct selection on multiple traits was likely necessary in the evolution of the H. axyridis invasion syndrome. Furthermore, they show the strength of using artificial selection to identify the traits that are correlated in different selective contexts, which represents a crucial first step in understanding the evolution of complex phenotypic patterns, including invasion syndromes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTreating cancer depends in part on identifying the mutations driving each patients disease. Many clinical laboratories are adopting high-throughput sequencing for assaying patients tumours, applying targeted panels to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour tissues to detect clinically-relevant mutations. While there have been some benchmarking and best practices studies of this scenario, much variant-calling work focuses on whole-genome or whole-exome studies, with fresh or fresh-frozen tissue. Thus, definitive guidance on best choices for sequencing platforms, sequencing strategies, and variant calling for clinical variant detection is still being developed.\n\nResultsBecause ground truth for clinical specimens is rarely known, we used the well-characterized Coriell cell lines GM12878 and GM12877 to generate data. We prepared samples to mimic as closely as possible clinical biopsies, including formalin fixation and paraffin embedding. We evaluated two well-known targeted sequencing panels, Illuminas TruSight 170 panel and the Oncomine Focus panel. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina NextSeq500 and an Ion Torrent PGM respectively. We performed multiple biological replicates of each assay, to test reproducibility. Finally, we applied five different public and freely-available somatic single-nucleotide variant (SNV) callers to the data, MuTect2, SAMtools, VarScan2, Pisces and VarDict. Although the TruSight 170 and Oncomine Focus panels cover different amounts of the genome, we did not observe major differences in variant calling success within the regions that each covers. We observed substantial discrepancies between the five variant callers. All had high sensitivity, detecting known SNVs, but highly varying and non-overlapping false positive detections. Harmonizing variant caller parameters or intersecting the results of multiple variant callers reduced disagreements. However, intersecting results from biological replicates was even better at eliminating false positives.\n\nConclusionsReproducibility and accuracy of targeted clinical sequencing results depends less on sequencing platform and panel than on downstream bioinformatics and biological variability. Differences in variant callers default parameters are a greater influence on algorithm disagreement than other differences between the algorithms. Contrary to typical clinical practice, we recommend analyzing replicate samples, as this greatly decreases false positive calls.",

Further, the thyrocytes could be split into two sub-populations with unique transcriptional signature, including differential expression of the transcription factor pax2a. To validate thyrocyte heterogeneity, we generated a CRISPR/Cas9-based pax2a knock-in line, which demonstrated specific pax2a expression in the thyrocytes.

However, the molecular events that accompanied this emergence remain largely unknown. Here, we describe two MTBC strains isolated from patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, representing an as-yet-unknown lineage, named Lineage 8 (L8), seemingly restricted to the African Great Lakes region. Using genome-based phylogenetic reconstruction, we show that L8 is a sister clade to the known MTBC lineages. Comparison with other complete mycobacterial genomes indicate that the divergence of L8 preceded the loss of the cobF genome region - involved in the cobalamin/vitamin B12 synthesis - and gene interruptions in a subsequent common ancestor shared by all other known MTBC lineages. This discovery further supports an East African origin for the MTBC and provides additional molecular clues on the ancestral genome reduction associated with adaptation to a pathogenic lifestyle.",

To understand the impact of this, we created an individual-based model where an order of magnitude decrease in home range increased maximum aggregated microbial mutations 4-fold after 20,000 years. We hypothesize that pathogen speciation and hence endemism increased with isolation, as global dispersal distances decreased through a mechanism similar to the theory of island biogeography. To investigate if such an effect could be found, we analysed where 145 zoonotic diseases have emerged in human populations and found quantitative estimates of reduced dispersal of ectoparasites and fecal pathogens significantly improved our ability to predict the locations of outbreaks (increasing variance explained by 8%). There are limitations to this analysis which we discuss in detail, but if further studies support these results, they broadly suggest that reduced pathogen dispersal following megafauna extinctions may have increased the emergence of zoonotic pathogens moving into human populations.",

Seedling production seems to be one of the most important alternatives to population recovery. Besides that, the knowledge of seedling production methods influence over germination is very restricted. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of parent populations, germination conditions, and the substrate to commercial seedling production of E. edulis. Nine thousand seven hundred and thirteen seeds were distributed between the heated water and control, greenhouse and open-field treatments. The parent population presented high differences between most of the germination indexes. Influencing the germination rate, mean germination time and germination speed, but not affecting synchrony and uncertainty indexes. Heated water treatment did not affect any of the studied indexes, presenting a close pattern of germination over time, indicating it is an appropriate method for seedling production. Greenhouse and open-field treatment presented variations at the same indexes affected in the parent population analysis. The most profitable method for E. edulis seed germination was the greenhouse production method, which provided the best indexes results.",

No cGAMP exporter has been identified, and SLC19A1, a recently identified cGAMP importer, does not account for the import activity in most cell types. Here, we identify the LRRC8A:C heteromeric channel, a volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC), as a cGAMP transporter. This channel mediates cGAMP import or export depending on the cGAMP chemical gradient, and channel activation or inhibition modulates cGAMP transport. Other 23-cyclic dinucleotides are also transported by LRRC8A:C channels, including the investigational cancer therapeutic ADU-S100. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LRRC8A-containing channel is the dominant cGAMP importer in primary human vasculature cells. Given tumor vasculatures regulation of immune infiltration and its disruption in response to STING agonists, we have uncovered a leading molecular mechanism for extracellular cGAMP signaling in this important anti-cancer target.",

    "abstract": "Super-resolution microscopy and single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy require mutually exclusive experimental strategies optimizing either time or spatial resolution. To achieve both, we implement a GPU-supported, camera-based measurement strategy that highly resolves spatial structures (~60 nm), temporal dynamics ([&le;] 2 ms), and molecular brightness from the exact same data set. We demonstrate the applicability and advantages of multi-parametric measurements to monitor the super-resolved structure and dynamics of two different biomolecules, the actin binding polypeptide LifeAct, and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Simultaneous super-resolution of spatial and temporal details leads to an improved precision in estimating the diffusion coefficient of LifeAct in dependence of the cellular actin network. Multi-parametric analysis suggests that the domain partitioning of EGFR is primarily determined by EGFR-membrane interactions, possibly sub-resolution clustering and inter-EGFR interactions but is largely independent of EGFR-actin interactions. These results demonstrate that pixel-wise cross-correlation of parameters obtained from different techniques on the same data set enables robust physicochemical parameter estimation and provides new biological knowledge that cannot be obtained from sequential measurements.",

We show that the process can be divided into three successive stages: (1) only antibiotic subdiffusion with constant biofilm parameters, (2) subdiffusion and absorption of antibiotic molecules with variable biofilm parameters, (3) subdiffusion and absorption in the medium but biofilm parameters are constant. Stage 2 is interpreted as the appearance of an intensive defence bulid-up of bacteria against the action of an antibiotic, in the stage 3 it is likely that the bacteria have been inactivated. Times at which stages change are determined from the experimentally obtained temporal evolution of the amount of substance that has diffused through the ASM with bacteria.

    "abstract": "The spread of COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has been growing since its first identification in December 2019. The publishing of the first SARS-CoV-2 genome made a valuable source of data to study the details about its phylogeny, evolution, and interaction with the host. Protein-protein binding assays have confirmed that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is more likely to be the cell receptor through which the virus invades the host cell. In the present work, we provide an insight into the interaction of the viral spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) from different coronavirus isolates with host ACE2 protein. By calculating the binding energy score between RBD and ACE2, we highlighted the putative jump in the affinity from a progenitor form of SARS-CoV-2 to the current virus responsible for COVID-19 outbreak. Our result was consistent with previously reported phylogenetic analysis and corroborates the opinion that the interface segment of the spike protein RBD might be acquired by SARS-CoV-2 via a complex evolutionary process rather than a progressive accumulation of mutations. We also highlighted the relevance of Q493 and P499 amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 RBD for binding to human ACE2 and maintaining the stability of the interface. Moreover, we show from the structural analysis that it is unlikely for the interface residues to be the result of genetic engineering. Finally, we studied the impact of eight different variants located at the interaction surface of ACE2, on the complex formation with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We found that none of them is likely to disrupt the interaction with the viral RBD of SARS-CoV-2.",

While species-specific analyses of Altiarchaeota suggest site-specific adaptations and a particular biogeographic pattern, chemolithoautotrophic core features of the communities appeared to be conserved across 17 groundwater ecosystems between 5 and 3200 m depth. We identified a significant negative correlation between ecosystem depth and bacterial replication, except for samples impacted by high amounts of subsurface gases, which exhibited near-surface activity.

To explore this question, we performed calcium imaging in a large number of individual CA1 neurons during both trace eye-blink conditioning and subsequent extinction learning in mice. Using trial-averaged calcium fluorescence analysis, we found direct evidence that in real time, as learning emerges, distinct populations of CA1 cells contribute to trace conditioned learning versus extinction learning. Furthermore, we examined network connectivity by calculating co-activity between CA1 neuron pairs, and found that CA1 network connectivity is different between conditioning and extinction and between correct versus incorrect behavioral responses during trace conditioned learning. However, the overall connectivity density remains constant across these behavioral conditions. Together, our results demonstrate that distinct populations of CA1 neurons, forming different sub-networks with unique connectivity patterns, encode different aspects of learning.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid zones provide a window into the evolutionary processes governing species divergence. While the role of postzygotic isolation has been extensively characterized in the context of hybrid zones, the contribution of prezygotic isolation is less well explored. Here, we investigate the effects of assortative mate choice, the underlying preference function and mating-trait architecture, and the strength of sexual selection on hybrid zone dynamics. We explore this question by means of a mathematical model parameterized with phenotype and genotype data from the hybrid zone between all-black carrion and grey-coated hooded crows. The best-fit model resulted in narrow clines for two mating-trait loci coding for colour phenotype maintained by a moderate degree of assortative mating. Epistasis between the two loci induced hybrid-zone movement in favor of alleles conveying dark plumage followed by a shift in the opposite direction favouring grey-coated phenotypes [~]1,200 generations after secondary contact. Unlinked neutral loci diffused near-unimpeded across the zone. These results were generally robust to the choice of matching rule (self-referencing or parental imprinting) and effects of genetic drift. Overall, this study illustrates under which conditions assortative mating can maintain steep clines in mating-trait loci without generalizing to genome-wide reproductive isolation. It further emphasizes the importance of mating-trait architecture for spatio-temporal hybrid-zone dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Although metabolic and sleep disturbances are commonly associated, the underlying processes are not yet fully defined. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), an anabolic hormone that shows a circadian pattern in the circulation and activity-dependent entrance in the brain, is associated to sleep regulation along evolution. However, its role in this universal homeostatic process remains poorly understood. We now report that the activity of orexin neurons, a discrete cell population in the lateral hypothalamus that is involved in the circadian sleep/wake cycle and arousal, is modulated by circulating IGF-I. Furthermore, mice with blunted IGF-I receptor activity in orexin neurons have lower levels of orexin in the hypothalamus, show altered electrocorticographic patterns with predominant slow wave activity, reduced onset-sleep latency, and less transitions between sleep and awake stages. Collectively, these results extend the role of this pleiotropic growth factor to shaping sleep architecture through regulation of orexin neurons. We speculate that poor sleep quality associated to diverse conditions may be related to disturbed brain IGF-I input to orexin neurons.",

    "abstract": "An outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 respiratory disease, has infected over 290,000 people since the end of 2019, killed over 12,000, and caused worldwide social and economic disruption1,2. There are currently no antiviral drugs with proven efficacy nor are there vaccines for its prevention. Unfortunately, the scientific community has little knowledge of the molecular details of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To illuminate this, we cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the 29 viral proteins in human cells and identified the human proteins physically associated with each using affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), which identified 332 high confidence SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Among these, we identify 66 druggable human proteins or host factors targeted by 69 existing FDA-approved drugs, drugs in clinical trials and/or preclinical compounds, that we are currently evaluating for efficacy in live SARS-CoV-2 infection assays. The identification of host dependency factors mediating virus infection may provide key insights into effective molecular targets for developing broadly acting antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and other deadly coronavirus strains.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionLifestyle-related diseases like type 2 diabetes mellitus, have emerged as a significant public health problem due to rapid urbanization and industrialization. In 2018, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus was estimated to be 500 million cases worldwide and was comparable between high- and low-income countries. Diabetes leads to multiple complications, including end-stage renal disease, cardiovascular disease, infection, and death. Anaemia in diabetic individuals has severe adverse effects on the quality of life and is associated with disease progression. A cross-sectional study was conducted that included 101 participants. The study aimed to determine the prevalence of anaemia and kidney disease and their interplay with medication and/or blood glucose levels in T2D patients.\n\nResultsseventy-one per cent of participants were females. Majority of patients 62% were on Insulin, 30% on metformin, 7% on a combination of metformin and glimepiride and 1% on glimepiride. Ninety-five (94%) of the participants were HIV negative. The prevalence of anaemia among the participants was 23% out of which 56% had moderate anaemia, and 44% had mild anaemia. Twenty-one per cent (21%) of the participants had high creatinine levels signifying impaired kidney function or kidney disease. Anaemia was significantly associated with kidney function, fasting blood glucose and use of metformin; p = 0.042 beta = 2.5, p = 0.025 beta = 2.7 and p = 0.040 beta = -2.5 respectively.\n\nConclusionThe study found the prevalence of anaemia of 23%, which was of moderate public health concern. Also, the prevalence of kidney disease was high in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. It also found that kidney disease and high blood glucose levels increase the chances of developing anaemia. However, we found that metformin had a protective role against the development of anaemia in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus patients.",

    "abstract": "Express saccades are unusually short latency, visually guided saccadic eye movements. They are most commonly observed when the fixation spot disappears at a consistent, short interval before a target spot appears at a repeated location. The saccade countermanding task includes no fixation-target gap, variable target presentation times, and the requirement to withhold saccades on some trials. These testing conditions should discourage production of express saccades. However, two macaque monkeys performing the saccade countermanding task produced consistent, multimodal distributions of saccadic latencies. These distributions consisted of a longer mode extending from 200 ms to as much as 600 ms after target presentation and another consistently less than 100 ms after target presentation. Simulations revealed that by varying express saccade production, monkeys could earn more reward. If express saccades were not rewarded, they were rarely produced. The distinct mechanisms producing express and longer saccade latencies were revealed further by the influence of regularities in the duration of the fixation interval preceding target presentation on saccade latency. Temporal expectancy systematically affected the latencies of regular but not of express saccades. This study highlights that cognitive control can integrate information across trials and strategically elicit intermittent very short latency saccades to acquire more reward.",

    "abstract": "RNA molecules can fold into complex structures and interact with trans-acting factors to control their biology. Recent methods have been focused on developing novel tools to measure RNA structure transcriptome-wide, but their utility to study and predict RNA-protein interactions or RNA processing has been limited thus far. Here, we extend these studies with the first transcriptomewide mapping method for cataloging RNA solvent accessibility, icLASER. By combining solvent accessibility (icLASER) with RNA flexibility (icSHAPE) data, we efficiently predict RNA-protein interactions transcriptome-wide and catalog RNA polyadenylation sites by RNA structure alone. These studies showcase the power of designing novel chemical approaches to studying RNA biology. Further, our study exemplifies merging complementary methods to measure RNA structure inside cells and its utility for predicting transcriptome-wide interactions that are critical for control of and regulation by RNA structure. We envision such approaches can be applied to studying different cell types or cells under varying conditions, using RNA structure and footprinting to characterize cellular interactions and processing involving RNA.",

    "abstract": "A key unknown of the functional space in tumor immunity is whether physiologically relevant cancer antigen presentation occurs solely in draining lymph nodes versus tumors. Professional antigen presenting cells, i.e. the dendritic cells, are scarce and immature within tumors, greatly outnumbered by MHCII expressing non-hematopoietic cells, such as antigen-presenting cancer-associated fibroblasts (apCAFs). We hypothesized that after their exit from tumor-draining lymph nodes T cells depend on a second wave of antigen presentation provided in situ by structural cells. We show that dense apCAF regions in human lung tumors define hot immunological spots with increased numbers of CD4 T cells. The transcriptomic profile of human lung apCAFs aligned to that of pancreatic apCAFs across mice and humans and were both enriched for alveolar type II genes, suggesting an epithelial origin. Mechanistically, human apCAFs directly activated the TCRs of adjacent effector CD4 T cells and at the same time produced high levels of c1q, which acted on surface c1qbp on T cells to rescue them from apoptosis. Fibroblast-specific deletion of MHCII in mice impaired local MHCII immunity and accelerated tumor growth, while inducing c1qbp overexpression in adoptively transferred T cells expanded their numbers within tumors and reduced tumour burden. Collectively, our work shows that tumor T cell immunity post lymph node exit requires peripheral antigen presentation by a subset of CAFs and proposes a new conceptual framework upon which effective cancer immunotherapies can be built.",

    "abstract": "To combat the pandemic of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), numerous governments have established phone hotlines to prescreen potential cases. These hotlines have struggled with the volume of callers, leading to wait times of hours or, even, an inability to contact health authorities. Symptoma is a symptom-to-disease digital health assistant that can differentiate more than 20,000 diseases with an accuracy of more than 90%. We tested the accuracy of Symptoma to identify COVID-19 using a set of diverse clinical cases combined with case reports of COVID-19. We showed that Symptoma can accurately distinguish COVID-19 in 96.32% of clinical cases. When considering only COVID-19 symptoms and risk factors, Symptoma identified 100% of those infected when presented with only three signs. Lastly, we showed that Symptomas accuracy far exceeds that of simple \"yes-no\" questionnaires widely available online. In summary, Symptoma provides unparalleled accuracy in systematically identifying cases of COVID-19 while also considering over 20,000 other diseases. Furthermore, Symptoma allows free text input, furthered with disease-specific follow up questions, in 36 languages. Combined, these results and accessibility give Symptoma the potential to be a key tool in the global fight against COVID-19.

    "abstract": "When people are forced to be isolated from one another, do they crave social interactions? To address this question, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure neural responses evoked by food and social cues after participants (n=40) experienced ten hours of mandated fasting or total social isolation. After isolation, people felt lonely and craved social interaction. Midbrain regions showed selective activation to food cues after fasting and to social cues after isolation; these responses were correlated with self-reported craving. By contrast, striatal and cortical regions differentiated between craving food versus social interaction. Across deprivation sessions, we find that deprivation narrows and focuses the brains motivational responses to the deprived target. Our results support the intuitive idea that acute isolation causes social craving, similar to the way fasting causes hunger.",

    "abstract": "Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 (EWSR1) encodes a multifunctional protein that can cooperate with the transcription factor ERG to promote prostate cancer. The EWSR1 gene is also commonly involved in oncogenic gene rearrangements in Ewing sarcoma. Despite the cancer relevance of EWSR1, its regulation is poorly understood. Here we find that in prostate cancer, androgen signaling upregulates a 5 EWSR1 isoform by promoting usage of an intronic polyadenylation site. This isoform encodes a cytoplasmic protein that can strongly promote cell migration and clonogenic growth. Deletion of an Androgen Receptor (AR) binding site near the 5 EWSR1 polyadenylation site abolished androgen-dependent upregulation. This polyadenylation site is also near the Ewing sarcoma breakpoint hotspot, and androgen signaling promoted R-loop and breakpoint formation. RNase H overexpression reduced breakage and 5 EWSR1 isoform expression suggesting an R-loop dependent mechanism. These data suggest that androgen signaling can promote R-loops internal to the EWSR1 gene leading to early transcription termination and breakpoint formation.",

Noninvasive detection of the ZI and surrounding region could be critical to further our understanding of this widely connected but poorly understood deep brain region and could contribute to the development and optimization of neuromodulatory therapies. We demonstrate that high resolution (submillimetric) longitudinal (T1) relaxometry measurements at high magnetic field strength (7 Tesla) can be used to delineate the ZI from surrounding white matter structures, specifically the fasciculus cerebellothalamicus, fields of Forel (fasciculus lenticularis, fasciculus thalamicus, field H), and medial lemniscus. Using this approach, we successfully derived in vivo estimates of the size, shape, location, and tissue characteristics of substructures in the ZI region, confirming observations only previously possible through histological evaluation that this region is not just a space between structures but contains distinct morphological entities that should be considered separately. Our findings pave the way for increasingly detailed in vivo study and provide a structural foundation for precise functional and neuromodulatory investigation.",

    "abstract": "Understanding social organization is fundamental for the analysis of animal societies. In this study, animal single-file movement data -serialized order movements generated by simple bottom-up rules of collective movements-- are informative and effective observations for the reconstruction of animal social structures using agent-based models. For simulation, artificial 2-dimensional spatial distributions were prepared with the simple assumption of clustered structures of a group. Animals in the group are either independent or dependent agents. Independent agents distribute spatially independently each one another, while dependent agents distribute depending on the distribution of independent agents. Artificial agent spatial distributions aim to represent clustered structures of agent locations -a coupling of \"core\" or \"keystone\" subjects and \"subordinate\" or \"follower\" subjects. Collective movements were simulated following two simple rules, 1) initiators of the movement are randomly chosen, and 2) the next moving agent is always the nearest neighbor of the last moving agents, generating \"single-file movement\" data. Finally, social networks were visualized, and clustered structures reconstructed using a recent major social network analysis (SNA) algorithm, the Louvain algorithm, for rapid unfolding of communities in large networks. Simulations revealed possible reconstruction of clustered social structures using relatively minor observations of single-file movement, suggesting possible application of single-file movement observations for SNA use in field investigations of wild animals.",

To therapeutically target mitophagy, the fundamental in vivo dynamics and molecular mechanisms must be fully understood.

In fasted muscle, volumetric mitolysosome size analyses documented organelle stress-response dynamics, and time-lapse imaging revealed mitochondrial filaments undergo piecemeal fragmentation and recycling rather than the wholesale turnover observed in cultured cells. Hypoxia-inducible factor (Hif) pathway activation through physiological hypoxia or chemical or genetic modulation also provoked mitophagy. Intriguingly, mutation of a single mitophagy receptor bnip3 prevented this effect, whereas disruption of other putative hypoxia-associated mitophagy genes bnip3la (nix), fundc1, pink1 or prkn (Parkin) had no effect. This in vivo imaging study establishes fundamental dynamics of fasting-induced mitophagy and identifies bnip3 as the master regulator of Hif-induced mitophagy in vertebrate muscle.",

    "abstract": "Dear Editor,Licorice is the root of Glycyrrhiza glabra L. (Leguminosae), which grows in various warm climates such as the Middle East, Asia, and Southern Europe. It is one of the oldest known medicinal herbs and is referred to as \"the father of herbal medicine.\" Glycyrrhizic acid (GA) (Fig. 1A), a triterpenoid saponin, is a major component of licorice. It has a variety of pharmacological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, neuroprotective, and immune effects, among others.[1]. Previous studies indicated that GA produces robust neuroprotection via the modulation of anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic factors, primarily through the ERK signaling pathway and its anti-inflammatory properties against high-mobility group box 1 phosphorylation and the suppression of inflammatory cytokine induction [2-4]. These results were based on pathological models. Although numerous pathways have been implicated in the neuroprotective effects of GA, the molecular mechanisms are not yet completely understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of GA in preventing age-related immune involution and cognitive disorders, the relationship between immune involution and cognition, and the underlying molecular mechanisms.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=141 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/008821v1_fig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (43K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5a123dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@163a085org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bfadb6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@125b2ae_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 1.C_FLOATNO Glycyrrhizic acid ameliorated cognitive declines in aged mice, improved CBF and increased T and B cell numbers.

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo identify and characterize CD138 (syndecan 1)-expressing T cells in SLE-prone mice.\n\nMethodsWe characterized CD138-expressing T cells in MRL/Lpr mice by flow cytometry assay and by gene analysis. Functional properties of TCR{beta}+CD138+ cells were assessed either by activating through TCR or by co-incubating with purified B cells in the presence of auto-antigens. Purified TCR{beta}+CD138+ cells were adoptively transferred into MRL/Lpr mice and lupus disease was assessed by measuring serum auto-antibodies, proteinuria and by histopathological evaluation of kidney.\n\nResultsWe found that the frequency of TCR{beta}+CD138+ cells was significantly higher in MRL/Lpr mice than in wild-type MRL mice (p < 0.01), and the increase in their numbers correlated with disease severity. Majority of the TCR{beta}+CD138+ cells were CD4 and CD8 double-negative and 20% were CD4. Compared to TCR{beta}+CD138- cells, TCR{beta}+CD138+ cells exhibited central memory phenotype with reduced ability to proliferate, and produce the cytokines IFN{gamma} and IL-17. When co-cultured with B cells, the ability of TCR{beta}+CD138+ cells to promote plasma cell formation and autoreactive antibody production was dependent on the presence of auto-antigens and CD4 co-receptor expression. Surprisingly, adoptively transferred TCR{beta}+CD138+ cells slowed down the disease progression in young MRL/Lpr mice but had the opposite effect when DNA was co-administered or when TCR{beta}+CD138+ cells were transferred into older MRL/Lpr mice with established disease.\n\nConclusionHere, we provided evidence for the pathogenic role of CD138-expressing T cells when auto-antigens are exposed to immune system. Thus, monitoring the changes in TCR{beta}+CD138+ cell-frequency may serve as a tool to assess SLE severity. Moreover, CD138-expressing T cells may be targeted to alleviate lupus progression.",

    "abstract": "Memory CD4+ T helper type 2 (Th2) cells are critical in driving allergic asthma pathogenesis, yet the mechanisms whereby tissue-resident memory Th2 cells (Th2 Trm) and circulating memory Th2 cells collaborate in vivo remain unclear. Here, using a house dust mite (HDM) model of allergic asthma and parabiosis, we demonstrate that Th2 Trm and circulating memory Th2 cells perform non-redundant functions in vivo. Upon HDM re-challenge, circulating memory Th2 cells trafficked into the lung parenchyma and ignited perivascular inflammation to promote eosinophil and CD4+ T cell recruitment. In contrast, Th2 Trm proliferated near airways and promoted mucus metaplasia, airway hyper-responsiveness, and airway eosinophil activation. Transcriptional analysis revealed that Th2 Trm and circulating memory Th2 cells share a core Th2 gene signature, but also exhibit distinct transcriptional profiles. Specifically, Th2 Trm express a tissue adaptation signature, including genes involved in regulating and interacting with extracellular matrix. Our findings demonstrate that Th2 Trm and circulating memory Th2 cells are functionally and transcriptionally distinct subsets with unique roles in promoting allergic airway disease.\n\nSUMMARYHow memory Th2 cell subsets orchestrate allergic airway inflammation remains unclear. Rahimi et al. use a murine model of allergic asthma and parabiosis to demonstrate that tissue-resident and circulating memory Th2 cells are functionally distinct subsets with unique roles in promoting allergic airway disease.",

    "abstract": "A novel coronavirus (the SARS-CoV-2) has been identified in January 2020 as the causal pathogen for COVID-19 pneumonia, an outbreak started near the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China. The SARS-CoV-2 was found to be closely related to the SARS-CoV, based on the genomic analysis. The Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 protein (ACE2) utilized by the SARS-CoV as a receptor was found to facilitate the infection of SARS-CoV-2 as well, initiated by the binding of the spike protein to the human ACE2. Using homology modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methods, we report here the detailed structure of the ACE2 in complex with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The predicted model is highly consistent with the experimentally determined complex structures. Plausible binding modes between human ACE2 and the RBD were revealed from all-atom MD simulations. The simulation data further revealed critical residues at the complex interface and provided more details about the interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and human ACE2. Two mutants mimicking rat ACE2 were modeled to study the mutation effects on RBD binding to ACE2. The simulations showed that the N-terminal helix and the K353 of the human ACE2 alter the binding modes of the CoV2-RBD to the ACE2.",

    "abstract": "Protein function is regulated by post-translational modifications, among which reversible oxidation of Cys (Cys ox-PTM) emerged as a key regulatory mechanism of cellular responses. The redox regulation of virus-host interactions is well documented, but in most cases, proteins subjected to Cys ox-PTM remain unknown. The identification of Cys ox-PTM sites in vivo is essential to underpin our understanding of the mechanisms of the redox regulation. In this study, we present a proteome-wide identification of reversible Cys ox-PTM sites in vivo during stimulation by oxidants using a maleimide-based bioswitch method coupled to mass spectrometry. We identified 2720 unique Cys ox-PTM sites encompassing 1473 proteins with distinct abundance, location and functions. Label-free quantification (LFQ)-based analysis revealed the enrichment of ox-PTM in numerous pathways, many relevant to virus-host interaction. Here, we focused on the oxidation of STING, the central adaptor of the innate immune type I interferon pathway induced upon detection of cytosolic DNA. We provide the first in vivo demonstration of reversible oxidation of Cys148 and Cys206 of STING. Molecular analyses led us to establish a new model in which Cys148 oxidation is constitutive, while Cys206 oxidation is inducible by oxidative stress or by the natural ligand 23-cGAMP. We show that oxidation of Cys206 has an inhibitory function to prevent STING hyperactivation through the constraint of a conformational change associated with the formation of inactive polymers containing intermolecular disulfide bonds. This provides new ground for the design of therapies targeting STING relevant to autoinflammatory disorders, immunotherapies and vaccines.\n\nBrief summary of the main resultsThe function of proteins is regulated by post-translational modifications, among which reversible oxidation of Cys recently emerged as a key component. Comprehension of redox regulation of cellular responses requires identification of specific oxidation sites in vivo. Using a bioswitch method to specifically label Cys subjected to reversible oxidation coupled to mass spectrometry, we identified thousands of novel oxidation sites. Many are relevant to virus-host interaction pathways. Here, we focused on the oxidation of STING, an adaptor critical for activating the innate immune type I interferon pathway engaged upon cytosolic DNA sensing. Molecular studies led us to establish a new model in which STING Cys148 is oxidized at basal levels, while Cys206 oxidation is induced by oxidative stress and ligand binding. We show that oxidation of Cys206 has an inhibitory function to prevent STING hyperactivation. This study provides ground for novel research avenues aimed at designing therapeutics that target this pathway.",

In conventional theory, GP and Rd were responsive to regulatory factors respectively and independently of each other. Even though GP and Rd responded in reverse to insulin, GP for suppression and Rd for elevation, these inverse alterations used to be attributed to insulin multiple functions both on hepatic GP, directly or indirectly, and on whole-body glucose Rd. However, in the present study, we found GP and Rd were inversely coupled intrinsically no matter which side was the target of insulin by comparison of Rd and GP data pairs between peripheral vein insulin infusion protocol and portal vein insulin infusion protocol in rats. Furthermore, neither circulating NEFA nor HFD induced resistance broke the GP-Rd inverse coupling, but both of them reduced the responses of both GP and Rd to insulin. In conclusion, we provide the evidence that GP and Rd are two coupled parameters in vivo and they alter in reverse simultaneously, the mechanism under which needs further investigation but we tend to believe an inter-organ neural reflex was involved.",

    "abstract": "Biofilms are surface-attached multicellular communities that create many problems in human health and various industries. Given the prominence of biofilms in biofouling and infectious diseases, antibiofilm control approaches are highly sought after. In the present study, we identified elasnin as a potent antibiofilm agent through a bioassay-guided approach. Elasnin specifically inhibited the biofilm formation of bacterial mono-species and eradicated the mature biofilm of Gram-positive bacteria at concentrations below 2.5 g/mL with a low toxic effect on cells and a low resistance risk. Confocal observations illustrated that elasnin decreased cell aggregations and destroyed the biofilm matrix. Furthermore, elasnin-based antibiofilm coatings were prepared and inhibited the formation of multi-species biofilms and the attachment of large biofouling organisms in the field test. These findings suggest that elasnin is a promising antibiofilm agent for future applications in biofilm control.\n\nImportanceDue to the increased diversity of biofilm-associated infections and the failure of conventional antimicrobial treatment, new and effective biofilm-specific pharmacologic strategies are urgently needed. Elasnin is a new antibiofilm natural product produced by Streptomyces with high efficiency and low toxicity. Elasnin effectively destroyed the biofilm matrix of Gram-positive bacteria, thus making them more susceptible to antibiotics. Unlike currently deployed antibiotic vancomycin, which exclusively targets essential life processes and kills the pathogen, elasnin did not exhibit bactericidal effect and thus held great potential in delaying resistance. With high yield, elasnin-based coatings were easily prepared with low expenditures and exhibited favorable performance in field test. Collectively, the antibiofilm properties of elasnin, combined with the low cost of supply and the low risk of resistance, could provide the basis for the development of a novel antibiofilm agent that could help fight to antibiotics resistance.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that crosstalk between -synuclein pathology formation and mitochondrial dysfunctions plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Parkinsons disease and related synucleinopathies. While mitochondrial dysfunction is a well-studied phenomenon in the substantia nigra, which is selectively vulnerable in Parkinsons disease and some models thereof, less information is available in other brain regions that are also affected by synuclein pathology.\n\nTherefore, we sought to test the hypothesis that early -synuclein pathology causes mitochondrial dysfunction, and that this effect might be exacerbated in conditions of increased vulnerability of affected brain regions, such as the amygdala.\n\nWe combined a model of intracerebral -synuclein pathology seeding with chronic glucocorticoid treatment modelling non-motor symptoms of Parkinsons disease and affecting amygdala physiology. We measured mitochondrial respiration, ROS generation and protein abundance as well as -synuclein pathology in male mice.\n\nChronic corticosterone administration induced mitochondrial hyperactivity in the amygdala. Although injection of -synuclein preformed fibrils into the striatum resulted in pronounced -synuclein pathology in both striatum and amygdala, mitochondrial respiration in these brain regions was altered in neither chronic corticosterone nor control conditions.\n\nOur results suggest that early stage -synuclein pathology does not influence mitochondrial respiration in the striatum and amygdala, even in corticosterone-induced respirational hyperactivity. We discuss our findings in light of relevant literature, warn of a potential publication bias and encourage scientist to report their negative results in the frame of this model.\n\nSignificance statementWe provide evidence that early stage synucleinopathy by itself or in combination with exogenous corticosterone induced amygdala hyperactivity did not compromise mitochondrial respiration in the striatum and amygdala in one of the most commonly used models of synucleinopathies. These results may explain, why this model in the hands of many research groups does not elicit pronounced Parkinsons disease like symptoms in the absence of mitochondrial dysfunction in brain regions strongly affected by synuclein pathology and involved in non-motor (amygdala) and motor (striatum) symptoms. Our findings call for rigorous investigation of the short- and long-term effects of -synuclein pathology on mitochondrial function/dysfunction in this model, in particular in brain regions strongly affected by neurodegeneration such as the substantia nigra pars compacta.",

    "abstract": "Yellow Stripe-Like (YSL) proteins are a family of plant transporters typically involved in transition metal homeostasis. The substrate of three of the four YSL clades (clades I, II, and IV) are metal complexes with non-proteinogenic amino acid nicotianamine or its derivatives. No such transport capabilities have been shown for any member of the remaining clade (clade III), which is able to translocate short peptides across the membranes instead. The connection between clade III YSL members and metal homeostasis might have been masked by the functional redundancy characteristic of this family. This might have been circumvented in legumes through neofunctionalization of YSLs to ensure a steady supply of transition metals for symbiotic nitrogen fixation in root nodules. To test this possibility, Medicago truncatula clade III transporter MtYSL7 has been studied both when the plant was fertilized with ammonium nitrate or when nitrogen had to be provided by endosymbiotic rhizobia within the root nodules. MtYSL7 is a plasma membrane protein expressed in the vasculature and in the nodule cortex. This protein is able to transport short peptides into the cytosol, although none with known metal homeostasis roles. Reducing MtYSL7 expression levels resulted in diminished nitrogen fixation rates. In addition, nodules of mutant lines lacking YSL7 accumulated more copper and iron, the later the likely result of increased expression in roots of iron uptake and delivery genes. The available data is indicative of a role of MtYSL7, and likely other clade III YSLs, in transition metal homeostasis.\n\nONE SENTENCE SUMMARYMedicago truncatula YSL7 is a peptide transporter required for symbiotic nitrogen fixation in legume nodules, likely controlling transition metal allocation to these organs.",

    "abstract": "Iron Overload Disorder (IOD) is a syndrome developed by captive browsing rhinoceroses like black rhinoceroses (Diceros bicornis) in which hemosiderosis settles in vital organs while free iron accumulates in the body, potentially predisposing to various secondary diseases. Captive grazing species like white rhinoceroses (Ceratotherium simum) do not seem to be affected. The pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory properties of iron, associated with the poor antioxidant capacities of black rhinoceroses, could enhance high levels of inflammation and oxidative stress leading to rapid ageing and promoting diseases. In this prospective study, 15 black (BR) and 29 white rhinoceroses (WR) originating from 22 European zoos were blood-sampled and compared for their iron status (serum iron), liver/muscle biochemical parameters (AST, GGT, cholesterol), inflammatory status (total proteins, protein electrophoresis) and oxidative stress markers (SOD, GPX, dROMs). Results showed higher serum iron and liver enzyme levels in black rhinoceroses (P&lt;0.01), as well as higher GPX (P&lt;0.05) and dROM (P&lt;0.01) levels. The albumin/globulin ratio was lower in black rhinoceroses (P&lt;0.05) due to higher \u03b12-globulin levels (P&lt;0.001). The present study suggests a higher inflammatory and oxidative profile in captive BR than in WR, possibly in relation to iron status. This could be either a consequence or a cause of iron accumulation, potentially explaining rapid ageing and various diseases. Further investigations are needed to assess the prognostic value of the inflammatory and oxidative markers in captive black rhinoceroses, particularly for evaluating the impact of reduced-iron and antioxidant-supplemented diets.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWFinding vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for global pandemic of virus diseases (such as the ongoing COVID-19) requires rapid analysis, annotation and evaluation of metagenomic libraries to enable a quick and efficient screening of nucleotide sequences. Traditional sequence alignment methods are not suitable and there is a need for fast alignment-free techniques for sequence analysis. Information theory and data compression algorithms provide a rich set of mathematical and computational tools to capture essential patterns in biological sequences. In 2013, our research group (Nagaraj et al., Eur. Phys. J. Special Topics 222(3-4), 2013) has proposed a novel measure known as Effort-To-Compress (ETC) based on the notion of compression-complexity to capture the information content of sequences. In this study, we propose a compression-complexity based distance measure for automatic identification of SARS coronavirus strains from a set of viruses using only short fragments of nucleotide sequences. We also demonstrate that our proposed method can correctly distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV-1 viruses by analyzing very short segments of nucleotide sequences. This work could be extended further to enable medical practitioners in automatically identifying and characterizing SARS coronavirus strain in a fast and efficient fashion using short and/or incomplete segments of nucleotide sequences. Potentially, the need for sequence assembly can be circumvented.\n\nNoteThe main ideas and results of this research were first presented at the International Conference on Nonlinear Systems and Dynamics (CNSD-2013) held at Indian Institute of Technology, Indore, December 12, 2013. In this manuscript, we have extended our preliminary analysis to include SARS-CoV-2 virus as well.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRARCTThe fast accumulation of viral metagenomic data has contributed significantly to new RNA virus discovery. However, the short read size, complex composition, and large data size can all make taxonomic analysis difficult. In particular, commonly used alignment-based methods are not ideal choices for detecting new viral species. In this work, we present a novel hierarchical classification model named CHEER, which can conduct read-level taxonomic classification from order to genus for new species. By combining k-mer embedding-based encoding, hierarchically organized CNNs, and carefully trained rejection layer, CHEER is able to assign correct taxonomic labels for reads from new species. We tested CHEER on both simulated and real sequencing data. The results show that CHEER can achieve higher accuracy than popular alignment-based and alignment-free taxonomic assignment tools.

    "abstract": "Iron, an essential element for all organisms, acts as a cofactor of enzymes in bacterial degradation of recalcitrant aromatic compounds. The bacterial family, Sphingomonadaceae comprises various degraders of recalcitrant aromatic compounds; however, little is known about their iron acquisition system. Here, we investigated the iron acquisition system in a model bacterium capable of degrading lignin-derived aromatics, Sphingobium sp. strain SYK-6. Analyses of SYK-6 mutants revealed that FiuA (SLG_34550), a TonB-dependent receptor (TBDR), was the major outer membrane iron transporter. Three other TBDRs encoded by SLG_04340, SLG_04380, and SLG_10860 also participated in iron uptake, and tonB2 (SLG_34550), one of the six tonB comprising the Ton complex which enables TBDR-mediated transport was critical for iron uptake. The ferrous iron transporter FeoB (SLG_36840) played an important role in iron uptake across the inner membrane. The promoter activities of most of the iron uptake genes were induced under iron-limited conditions, and their regulation is controlled by SLG_29410 encoding the ferric uptake regulator, Fur. Although feoB, among all the iron uptake genes identified is highly conserved in Sphingomonad strains, the outer membrane transporters seem to be diversified. Elucidation of the iron acquisition system promises better understanding of the bacterial degradation mechanisms of aromatic compounds.",

    "abstract": "The functions of the annexin family of proteins involve binding to Ca2+, lipid membranes, other proteins, and RNA, and the annexins share a common folded core structure at the C terminus. Annexin A11 (AnxA11) has a long N-terminal region, which is predicted to be disordered, binds RNA, and forms membraneless organelles involved in neuronal transport. Mutations in AnxA11 have been linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We studied the structure and stability of AnxA11 and identified a short stabilising segment in the N-terminal end of the folded core, which links domains I and IV. Crystal structure of the AnxA11 core highlights main-chain hydrogen bonding interactions formed through this bridging segment, which are likely conserved in most annexins. The structure was also used to study the currently known ALS mutations in AnxA11. Three of these mutations correspond to buried Arg residues highly conserved in the annexin family, indicating central roles in annexin folding. The structural data provide starting points for detailed structure-function studies of both full-length AnxA11 and the disease variants being identified in ALS.",

    "abstract": "Membrane tension plays an inhibitory role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) by impeding the transition of flat plasma membrane to hemispherical clathrin-coated structures (CCSs). Membrane tension also impedes the transition of hemispherical domes to omegashaped CCSs, a necessary step before their internalization via dynamin-mediated membrane scission. However, CME is not completely halted in cells under high tension conditions. Here we find that epsin, a membrane bending protein which inserts its N-terminus H0 helix into lipid bilayer, supports flat-to-dome transition and increases the stability of CCSs at high tension. This discovery is supported by molecular dynamic simulation of the epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) domain that becomes more structured when embedded in a lipid bilayer. In addition, epsin has an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) C-terminus domain which induces membrane curvature via steric repulsion. Insertion of H0 helix into lipid bilayer is not sufficient for stable epsin recruitment as deleting the IDP domain in epsin renders it cytosolic. Epsins binding to adaptor protein 2 and clathrin is critical for epsins association with CCSs under high tension conditions, supporting the importance of multivalent interactions in CCSs. Together, our results support a model where the ENTH and IDP domains of epsin have complementary roles to ensure CME initiation and CCS maturation are unimpeded under high tension environments.",

Wnt signaling has been utilized to correctly regenerate tissues along the primary axis in many animals. However, the causal molecular mechanisms that first launch Wnt signaling during regeneration are poorly characterized. We used the acoel worm Hofstenia miamia to identify processes that initiate Wnt signaling. Transcriptome profiling, in situ hybridization, and functional studies revealed a Wnt ligand, wnt-3, as an early wound-induced gene specifically activated in posterior-facing wound sites and was required for establishing posterior identity during regeneration. wnt-3 was upregulated upon amputation in stem cells, and its inhibition affected stem cell proliferation. Ectopic expression of anterior markers in wnt-3 RNAi head fragments was stem cell dependent. Chromatin accessibility data revealed that wnt-3 activation during regeneration required input from the general wound response. Additionally, the expression of a different Wnt ligand, wnt-1, prior to amputation was required for activation of wound-induced wnt-3 expression. Our study establishes a gene regulatory network for initiating Wnt signaling in posterior tissues in a bilaterian.",

    "abstract": "The nephron progenitor cells (NPCs) give rise to all segments of functional nephrons and are of great interest due to their potential as a source for novel treatment strategies for kidney disease. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signal plays pivotal roles in generating and maintaining NPCs during kidney development. However, molecule(s) regulating FGF signal during nephron development is not known. Sprouty (SPRY) is an antagonist of receptor tyrosine kinases. During kidney development, SPRY1 is expressed in the ureteric buds (UBs) and regulates UB branching by antagonizing Ret-GDNF signal. Here, we provide evidence that SPRY1 expressed in NPCs modulates activity of FGF signal in NPCs and regulates NPC stemness. Haploinsufficiency of Spry1 rescues bilateral renal agenesis and premature NPC differentiation caused by loss of Fgf9 and Fgf20. In addition, haploinsufficiency of Spry1 rescues NPC proliferation and cell death defects induced by loss of Fgf9 and Fgf20. In the absence of SPRY1, FGF9 and FGF20, another FGF ligand, FGF8 promotes nephrogenesis. Deleting both Fgf8 and Fgf20 results in kidney agenesis and defects in NPC proliferation and cell death. Rescue of loss of Fgf9 and Fgf20 induced renal agenesis by Spry1 haploinsufficiency was reversed when one copy of Fgf8 was deleted. These findings indicate the importance of the balance between positive and negative signal during NPC maintenance. Failure of the balance may underlie some human congenital kidney malformation.\n\nSignificance StatementNephrons are functional units of kidney to filter blood to excrete wastes and regulate osmolarity and ion concentrations. Nephrons are derived from nephron progenitors. Nephron progenitors are depleted during kidney development which makes it unable to regenerate nephrons. Therefore, understanding signaling molecules regulating nephron progenitor generation and maintenance is of great interest for the future kidney regenerative medicine. Here, we show that Sprouty1 regulates nephron progenitor maintenance by inhibiting FGF signal. Deletion of Sprouty1 rescues renal agenesis and nephron progenitor depletion in the Fgf9/20 loss-of-function kidneys. Further decrease of FGF signal by deleting one copy of Fgf8 makes kidneys irresponsive to Sprouty1 resulting in failure of nephron progenitor maintenance. This study thus identifies the reciprocal function of FGF-Sprouty1 signal during nephron progenitor development.",

    "abstract": "Membrane lipids act as solvents and functional cofactors for integral membrane proteins. The yeast plasma membrane is unusual in that it may have a high lipid order, which coincides with low passive permeability for small molecules and a slow lateral diffusion of proteins. Yet, membrane proteins whose functions require altered conformation must have flexibility within membranes. We have determined the molecular composition of yeast plasma membrane lipids located within a defined diameter of model proteins, including the APC-superfamily lysine transporter Lyp1. We now use the composition of lipids that naturally surround Lyp1 to guide testing of lipids that support the normal functioning of the transporter, when reconstituted in vesicles of defined lipid composition. We find that phosphatidylserine and ergosterol are essential for Lyp1 function, and the transport activity displays a sigmoidal relationship with the concentration of these lipids. Non-bilayer lipids stimulate transport activity, but different types are interchangeable. Remarkably, Lyp1 requires a relatively high fraction of lipids with one or more unsaturated acyl chains. The transport data and predictions of the periprotein lipidome of Lyp1, support a new model in which a narrow band of lipids immediately surrounding the transmembrane stalk of a model protein allows conformational changes in the protein.",

    "abstract": "In the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the diverse network comprising more than 20 members of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family and more than five PDI oxidases has evolved to promote oxidative protein folding. While the canonical disulfide bond formation pathway constituted by Ero1 and PDI has been well studied so far, mechanistic and physiological bases of newly identified PDI oxidases, glutathione peroxidase-7 (GPx7) and -8 (GPx8), are only poorly understood. We here demonstrated that human GPx7 has much higher reactivity with H2O2 than human GPx8, leading to efficient PDI oxidation. GPx7 forms a catalytic tetrad at the redox active site to react with H2O2 efficiently and stabilize a resultantly generated sulfenylated species. While it was previously postulated that the GPx7 catalysis involved a highly reactive peroxidatic cysteine, a resolving cysteine was found to act to regulate the PDI oxidation activity of GPx7. The present study also revealed that GPx7 formed complexes preferentially with PDI and P5 in H2O2-treated cells. Altogether, human GPx7 functions as an H2O2-dependent PDI oxidase in cells whereas PDI oxidation may not be the central physiological role of human GPx8.",

    "abstract": "The complexity of the cellular medium can affect proteins properties and therefore in-cell characterization of proteins is essential. We explored the stability and conformation of BIR1, the first baculoviral IAP repeat domain of X-chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), as a model for a homo-dimer protein in human HeLa cells. We employed double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy and labeling with redox stable and rigid Gd3+ spin labels at three protein residues, C12 (flexible region), E22C and N28C (part of helical residues 26-31) in the N-terminal region. In contrast to predictions by excluded volume crowding theory, the dimer-monomer dissociation constant KD was markedly higher in cells than in solution and dilute cell lysate. As expected, this increase was recapitulated under conditions of high salt concentrations given that a conserved salt bridge at the dimer interface is critically required for association. Unexpectedly, however, also the addition of a crowding agent such as Ficoll destabilized the dimer, suggesting that Ficoll forms specific interactions with the monomeric protein. Changes in DEER distance distributions were observed for the E22C site, which displayed reduced conformational freedom in cells. Although overall DEER behaviors at E22C and N28C were compatible with a predicted compaction of disordered protein regions by excluded volume effects, we were unable to reproduce E22C properties in artificially crowded solutions. These results highlight the importance of in-cell DEER measurements to appreciate the complexities of cellular in vivo effects on protein structures and functions.",

    "abstract": "MotivationAncestral haplotype maps provide useful information about genomic variation and biological processes. Reconstructing the descendent haplotype structure of homologous chromosomes, particularly for large numbers of individuals, can help with characterizing the recombination landscape, elucidating genotype-to-phenotype relationships, improving genomic predictions and more. Inferring haplotype maps from sparse genotype data is an efficient approach to whole-genome haplotyping, but this is a non-trivial problem. A standardized approach is needed to validate whether haplotype reconstruction software, conceived population designs and existing data for a given population provides accurate haplotype information for further inference.\n\nResultsWe introduce SPEARS, a pipeline for whole simulation-based appraisal of genome-wide ancestral haplotype inference. The pipeline generates virtual genotypes (truth data) with real-world missing data structure. It then proceeds to mimic analysis in practice, capturing sources of error due to imputation and reconstruction of ancestral haplotypes. Standard metrics allow researchers to assess which features of haplotype structure or regions of the genome are sufficiently accurate for analysis and reporting. Haplotype maps for 1,000 outcross progeny from a multi-parent population of maize is used to demonstrate SPEARS.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/maizeatlas/spears",

Factors secreted by epithelial cells could regulate inflammatory responses and release an  all is well signal such that the immune system is controlled. Here we show that lung epithelial cells are able to inhibit IL-2 driven type 2 cytokine release by PBMC cells across a transwell indicating the involvement of soluble mediators. We then fractionate the mediators within the conditioned media using methanol chloroform separation and size fractionation. Inhibitory activity was demonstrated within the polar fraction of supernatant separated by methanol chloroform extraction. We then found that lactate, a component within the polar fraction was able to mediate inhibition of the type 2 cytokines. The inhibitory activity of lactate deserves further study and could play a role in the inhibition of T cell derived cytokines in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Fatty acid biosynthesis (FASII) enzymes are considered valid targets for antimicrobial drug development against the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. However, incorporation of host fatty acids confers FASII antibiotic adaptation that compromises prospective treatments. S. aureus adapts to FASII inhibitors by a first non-replicative latency period followed by outgrowth. Here we used transcriptional fusions and direct metabolite measurements to investigate the factors that dictate the duration of latency prior to outgrowth. We show that stringent response induction leads to repression of FASII and phospholipid synthesis genes. (p)ppGpp induction inhibits synthesis of malonyl-CoA, a molecule that derepresses FapR, a key regulator of FASII and phospholipid synthesis. Anti-FASII treatment also triggers transient expression of (p)ppGpp-regulated genes during the anti-FASII latency phase, with concomitant repression of FapR regulon expression. These effects are reversed upon outgrowth. GTP depletion, a known consequence of stringent response, also occurs during FASII latency, and is proposed as the common signal linking these responses. We next show that anti-FASII treatment shifts malonyl-CoA distribution between its interactants FapR and FabD, towards FapR, increasing expression of phospholipid synthesis genes plsX and plsC during outgrowth. We conclude that components of the stringent response dictate malonyl-CoA availability in S. aureus FASII regulation, and contribute to latency prior to anti-FASII-adapted outgrowth. A combinatory approach, coupling a (p)ppGpp inducer and an anti-FASII, blocks S. aureus outgrowth, opening perspectives for bi-therapy treatment.\n\nImportanceStaphylococcus aureus is a major human bacterial pathogen for which new inhibitors are urgently needed. Antibiotic development has centered on the fatty acid synthesis (FASII) pathway, which provides the building blocks for bacterial membrane phospholipids. However, S. aureus overcomes FASII inhibition and adapts to anti-FASII by using exogenous fatty acids that are abundant in host environments. This adaptation mechanism comprises a transient latency period, followed by bacterial outgrowth. Here we use metabolite sensors and promoter reporters to show that responses to stringent conditions and to FASII inhibition intersect: both involve GTP and malonyl-CoA. These two signaling molecules contribute to modulating the duration of latency prior to S. aureus adaptation outgrowth. We exploit these novel findings to propose a bi-therapy treatment against staphylococcal infections.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe intrathecal (IT) dosing route introduces drugs directly into the CSF to bypass the blood-brain barrier and gain direct access to the CNS. We evaluated the use of convective forces acting on the cerebrospinal fluid as a means for increasing rostral delivery of IT dosed radioactive tracer molecules and antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) in the monkey CNS. We also measured the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) volume in a group of cynomolgus monkeys.\n\nMethodsThere are three studies presented, in each of which cynomolgus monkeys were injected into the IT space with radioactive tracer molecules and/or ASO by lumbar puncture in either a low or high volume. The first study used the radioactive tracer 64Cu-DOTA and PET imaging to evaluate the effect of the convective forces. The second study combined the injection of the radioactive tracer 99mTc-DTPA and ASO, then used SPECT imaging and ex vivo tissue analysis of the effects of convective forces to bridge between the tracer and the ASO distributions. The third experiment evaluated the effects of different injection volumes on the distribution of an ASO. In the course of performing these studies we also measured the CSF volume in the subject monkeys by Magnetic Resonance Imaging.\n\nResultsIt was consistently found that larger bolus dose volumes produced greater rostral distribution along the neuraxis. Thoracic percussive treatment also increased rostral distribution of low volume injections. There was little added benefit on distribution by combining the thoracic percussive treatment with the high-volume injection. The CSF volume of the monkeys was found to be 11.9 {+/-} 1.6 cm3.\n\nConclusionsThese results indicate that increasing convective forces after IT injection increases distribution of molecules up the neuraxis. In particular, the use of high IT injection volumes will be useful to increase rostral CNS distribution of therapeutic ASOs for CNS diseases in the clinic.",

Here we investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms using inducible gain and loss of function approaches in ILC2s and their precursors, respectively. Cross-examination of RNA sequencing and ATAC sequencing data obtained at different time points reveals a set of genes which are likely direct targets of E proteins. Consequently, a widespread down-regulation of chromatin accessibility occurs at a later time point, possibly due to the activation of transcriptional repressor genes such as Cbfa2t3 and Jdp2. The large number of genes repressed by gain of E protein function leads to the down-regulation of a transcriptional network important for ILC2 differentiation.\n\nSummaryDifferentiation of group 2 innate lymphoid cells is forcefully repressed by E protein transcription factors.

    "abstract": "Foraminifera are single-celled eukaryotes (protists) of large ecological importance, as well as environmental and paleoenvironmental indicators and biostratigraphic tools. In addition, they are capable of surviving in anoxic marine environments where they represent a major component of the benthic community. However, the cellular adaptations of Foraminifera to the anoxic environment remain poorly constrained. We sampled an oxic-anoxic transition zone in marine sediments from the Namibian shelf, where the genera Bolivina and Stainforthia dominated the Foraminifera community, and use metatranscriptomics to characterize Foraminifera metabolism across the different geochemical conditions. The relative abundance of Foraminifera gene expression in anoxic sediment depths increased an order of magnitude, which was confirmed in a ten-day incubation experiment where the development of anoxia coincided with a 27-fold increase in the relative abundance of Foraminifera protein encoding transcripts. This indicates that many Foraminifera were not only surviving, but thriving under the anoxic conditions. The anaerobic energy metabolism of these active Foraminifera was characterized by fermentation of sugars and amino acids, dissimilatory nitrate reduction, fumarate reduction, and dephosphorylation of creatine phosphate. This was co-expressed alongside genes involved in production of reticulopodia, phagocytosis, calcification, and clathrin-mediated-endocytosis (CME). Thus, Foraminifera may use CME under anoxic conditions to utilize dissolved organic matter as a carbon and energy source, in addition to ingestion of prey cells via phagocytosis. These mechanisms help explain how some Foraminifera can thrive under anoxia, which would help to explain their ecological success documented in the fossil record since the Cambrian period more than 500 million years ago.",

    "abstract": "The breakdown of self-incompatibility (SI) in angiosperms is one of the most commonly observed evolutionary transitions. While multiple examples of SI breakdown have been documented in natural populations, there is strikingly little evidence of stable within-population polymorphism with both inbreeding (self-compatible) and outcrossing (self-incompatible) individuals. This absence of mating system polymorphism corroborates theoretical expectations that predict that in/outbreeding polymorphism is possible only under very restricted conditions. However, theory also predicts that a diallelic sporophytic SI system facilitates the maintenance of such polymorphism. We tested this prediction by studying the mating system of Ligustrum vulgare L., an entomophilous hermaphroditic species of the Oleaceae family. Using stigma tests with controlled pollination and paternity assignment of open-pollinated progenies, we confirmed the existence of two self-incompatibility groups in this species. We also demonstrated the existence of self-compatible individuals in different populations of Western Europe arising from a mutation affecting the expression of the pollen component of SI. We then estimated the selfing rate in a garden experiment. Our results finally show that the observed low frequency of self-compatible individuals in natural populations is compatible with theoretical predictions only if inbreeding depression is very high.",

The journals included in Scopus are periodically re-evaluated to ensure they meet indexing criteria. Afterwards, some journals might be discontinued for publication concerns. Despite their discontinuation, previously published articles remain indexed and continue to be cited. The metrics and characteristics of journals discontinued for publication concerns have yet to be studied. This study aimed (1) to evaluate the main features and citation metrics of journals discontinued from Scopus for publication concerns, before and after discontinuation, and (2) to determine the extent of predatory journals among the discontinued journals.Materials and Methods Eight authors surveyed a list of discontinued journals from Scopus (version July 2019). Data regarding metrics, citations and indexing were extracted from Scopus or other scientific databases, for the journals discontinued for publication concerns.Results A total of 317 journals were evaluated. The mean number of citations per year after discontinuation was significantly higher than before (median of difference 64 citations, p&lt;0.0001), and so was the number of citations per document (median of difference 0.4 citations, p&lt;0.0001). The total number of citations after discontinuation was 607,261, with a median of 713 citations (IQR 254-2056, range 0-19468) per journal. The open access publishing model was declared for 93% (294/317) of the journals, but only nine of these are currently indexed in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). Twenty-two percent (72/317) of the journals were included in the Cabell blacklist.Conclusions The citation count of journals discontinued for publication concerns, increases despite discontinuation. Countermeasures should be taken to ensure the validity and reliability of Scopus metrics both at journal- and author-level for the purpose of scientific assessment of publishing.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a crucial step in post-transcriptional regulation. Previous bioinformatic works have mainly focused on the recognition of polyadenylation sites (PAS) in a given genomic sequence, which is a binary classification problem. Recently, computational methods for predicting the usage level of alternative PAS in a same gene have been proposed. However, all of them cast the problem as a non-quantitative pairwise comparison task and do not take the competition among multiple PAS into account. To address this, here we propose a deep learning architecture, DeeReCT-APA, to quantitatively predict the usage of all alternative PAS of a given gene. To accommodate different genes with potentially different numbers of PAS, DeeReCT-APA treats the problem as a regression task with a variable-length target. Based on a CNN-LSTM architecture, DeeReCT-APA extracts sequence features with CNN layers, uses bidirectional LSTM to explicitly model the interactions among competing PAS, and outputs percentage scores representing the usage levels of all PAS of a gene. In addition to the fact that only our method can predict quantitatively the usage of all the PAS within a gene, we show that our method consistently outperforms other existing methods on three different tasks for which they are trained: pairwise comparison task, highest usage prediction task and ranking task. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can be used to predict the effect of genetic variations on APA patterns and shed light on future mechanistic understanding in APA regulation.

    "abstract": "Cefiderocol is a novel cephalosporin designed to treat multidrug resistant Gram-negative infections. By forming a chelated complex with ferric iron, cefiderocol is transported into the periplasmic space via bacterial iron transport systems and primarily binds to penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP3) to inhibit peptidoglycan synthesis. This mode of action results in cefiderocol having greater in vitro activity against many Gram-negative bacilli than currently used carbapenems, {beta}-lactam/{beta}-lactamase inhibitor combinations, and cephalosporins. Thus, we investigated the in vitro activity of cefiderocol (S-649266) against a total of 271 clinical isolates of Burkholderia pseudomallei from Australia. The collection was comprised of primary isolates (92.3%) and subsequent isolates (7.7%). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of cefiderocol ranged from [&le;]0.03 to 32 mg/L, where the MIC90 was 1 mg/L and 16 mg/L for primary and subsequent isolates, respectively. Based upon non-species specific (Gram-negative bacilli) clinical breakpoints for cefiderocol (MIC [&le;] 4 mg/L), twelve isolates (4.4%) would be classified as non-susceptible. Further testing for co-resistance to meropenem, ceftazidime, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate and doxycycline was performed on a subset of isolates with elevated cefiderocol MICs ([&ge;]2 mg/L, 4.8%) and 84.6% of these isolates exhibited resistance to at least one of these antimicrobials. Cefiderocol was found to be highly active in vitro against B. pseudomallei primary clinical isolates. This novel compound shows great potential for the treatment of melioidosis in endemic countries and should be explored further.",

    "abstract": "The problem of fast calculation of Hamming distance inferred from many sequence datasets is still not a trivial task. Here, we present HamHeat, as a new software package to efficiently calculate Hamming distance for hundreds of aligned protein or DNA sequences of a large number of residues or nucleotides, respectively. HamHeat uses a unique algorithm with many advantages, including its ease of use and the execution of fast runs for large amounts of data. The package consists of three consecutive modules. In the first module, the software ranks the sequences from the most to the least frequent variant. The second module uses the most common variant as the reference sequence to calculate the Hamming distance of each additional sequence based on the number of residue or nucleotide changes. A final module formats all the results in a comprehensive table that displays the sequence ranks and Hamming distances.\n\nAvailability and implementationHamHeat is based on Python 3 and AWK, runs on Linux system and is available under the MIT License at: https://github.com/alexeyrakov/HamHeat.\n\nContactrakovalexey@gmail.com",

    "abstract": "Castration-resistant prostate cancer can be treated with the anti-androgen enzalutamide, but responses and duration of response are variable. To identify genes that support enzalutamide resistance, we performed a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen in the bone-homing, castration-resistant prostate cancer cell line, C4-2B. We identified eleven genes (TFAP2C, CAD, SPDEF, EIF6, GABRG2, CDC37, PSMD12, COL5A2, AR, MAP3K11, and ACAT1), whose loss resulted in decreased cell survival in response to enzalutamide. To validate our screen, we performed transient knockdowns in C4-2B and 22Rv1 cells and evaluated cell survival in response to enzalutamide. Through these studies, we validated three genes (ACAT1, MAP3K11, and PSMD12) as supporters of enzalutamide resistance in vitro. Although ACAT1 expression is lower in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer samples versus primary prostate cancer samples, knockdown of ACAT1 was sufficient to reduce cell survival in C4-2B and 22Rv1 cells. MAP3K11 expression increases with Gleason grade, and the highest expression is observed in metastatic castration-resistant disease. Knockdown of MAP3K11 reduced cell survival and pharmacologic inhibition of MAP3K11 with CEP-1347 in combination with enzalutamide resulted in a dramatic increase in cell death. This was associated with decreased phosphorylation of AR-Serine650, which is required for maximal AR activation. Finally, while PSMD12 expression did not change during disease progression, knockdown of PSMD12 resulted in decreased AR and AR splice variant expression, likely contributing to the C4-2B and 22Rv1 decrease in cell survival. Our study has therefore identified at least three new supporters of enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells in vitro.\n\nFinancial supportThe authors would like to acknowledge funding from the Joe C.

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (2019-nCoV), which first broke out in Wuhan (China) in December of 2019, causes a severe acute respiratory illness with a mortality ranging from 3% to 6%. To better understand the evolution of the newly emerging 2019-nCoV, in this paper, we analyze the codon usage pattern of 2019-nCoV. For this purpose, we compare the codon usage of 2019-nCoV with that of other 30 viruses belonging to the subfamily of orthocoronavirinae. We found that 2019-nCoV shows a rich composition of AT nucleotides that strongly influences its codon usage, which appears to be not optimized to human host. Then, we study the evolutionary pressures influencing the codon usage and evolutionary rates of the sequences of five conserved genes that encode the corresponding proteins (viral replicase, spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid) characteristic of coronaviruses. We found different patterns of both mutational bias and nature selection that affect the codon usage of these genes at different extents. Moreover, we show that the two integral membrane proteins proteins (matrix and envelope) tend to evolve slowly by accumulating nucleotide mutations on their genes. Conversely, genes encoding nucleocapsid (N), viral replicase and spike proteins are important targets for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs, tend to evolve faster as compared to other ones. Taken together, our results suggest that the higher evolutionary rate observed for these two genes could represent a major barrier in the development of antiviral therapeutics 2019-nCoV.",

    "abstract": "Spinal cord pMN progenitors sequentially produce motor neurons and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). Some OPCs differentiate rapidly as myelinating oligodendrocytes whereas others remain into adulthood. How pMN progenitors switch from producing motor neurons to OPCs with distinct fates is poorly understood. pMN progenitors express prdm8, which encodes a transcriptional repressor, during motor neuron and OPC formation. To determine if prdm8 controls pMN cell fate specification, we used zebrafish as a model system to investigate prdm8 function. Our analysis revealed that prdm8 mutant embryos have a deficit of motor neurons resulting from a premature switch from motor neuron to OPC production. Additionally, prdm8 mutant larvae have excess oligodendrocytes and a concomitant deficit of OPCs. Notably, pMN cells of mutant embryos have elevated Shh signaling coincident with the motor neuron to OPC switch. Inhibition of Shh signaling restored the number of motor neurons to normal but did not rescue the proportion of oligodendrocytes. These data suggest that Prdm8 regulates the motor neuron-OPC switch by controlling the level of Shh activity in pMN progenitors and also regulates allocation of oligodendrocyte lineage cell fates.\n\nSummary StatementPrdm8 regulates the timing of a motor neuron-oligodendrocyte switch and oligodendrocyte lineage cell identity in the zebrafish spinal cord.",

    "abstract": "Altered olfactory function is a common symptom of COVID-19, but its etiology is unknown. A key question is whether SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) - the causal agent in COVID-19 - affects olfaction directly by infecting olfactory sensory neurons or their targets in the olfactory bulb, or indirectly, through perturbation of supporting cells. Here we identify cell types in the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb that express SARS-CoV-2 cell entry molecules. Bulk sequencing revealed that mouse, non-human primate and human olfactory mucosa expresses two key genes involved in CoV-2 entry, ACE2 and TMPRSS2. However, single cell sequencing and immunostaining demonstrated ACE2 expression in support cells, stem cells, and perivascular cells; in contrast, neurons in both the olfactory epithelium and bulb did not express ACE2 message or protein. These findings suggest that CoV-2 infection of non-neuronal cell types leads to anosmia and related disturbances in odor perception in COVID-19 patients.",

    "abstract": "Daily temporal organisation of behavioural and physiological functions offers a fitness advantage for most animals. Optimized temporal niches are determined by an interplay between external environmental rhythms and internal circadian clocks. While daily light:dark cycles serve as a robust time cue (Zeitgeber) to synchronise circadian clocks, it is not clear how animals experiencing only weak environmental cues deal with this problem. Like humans, flies of the genus Drosophila originate in sub-Saharan Africa and spread North in Europe up to the polar circle where they experience extremely long days in the summer or even constant light (LL). LL is known to disrupt clock function, due to constant activation of the deep brain photoreceptor CRYPTOCHROME (CRY), which induces constant degradation of the clock protein TIMELESS (TIM). Temperature cycles are able to overcome these arrhythmia inducing effects of LL, reinstating clock protein oscillations and rhythmic behaviour. We show here that for this to occur a recently evolved natural allele (ls-tim) of the timeless gene is required, whereby the presence of this allele within the central clock neurons is sufficient. The ls-tim allele encodes a longer, less-light sensitive form of TIM (L-TIM) in addition to the shorter (S-TIM) form, the only form encoded by the ancient s-tim allele. Only after blocking light-input by removing functional CRY, s-tim flies are able to synchronise molecular and behavioural rhythms to temperature cycles in LL. Additional removal of light input from the visual system results in a phase advance of molecular and behavioural rhythms, showing that the visual system contributes to temperature synchronization in LL. We show that ls-tim, but not s-tim flies can synchronise their behavioural activity to semi-natural LL and temperature cycle conditions reflecting long Northern Europe summer days, the season when Drosophila populations massively expand. Our observations suggest that this functional gain associated with ls-tim is driving the Northern spread of this allele by directional selection.",

    "abstract": "Optogenetic manipulations have transformed neuroscience in recent years. While sophisticated tools now exist for controlling the firing patterns of neurons, it remains challenging to optogenetically define the plasticity state of individual synapses. A variety of synapses in the mammalian brain express presynaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) upon elevation of presynaptic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), but the molecular expression mechanisms as well as the impact of presynaptic LTP on network activity and behavior are not fully understood. In order to establish optogenetic control of presynaptic cAMP levels and thereby presynaptic potentiation, we developed synaptoPAC, a presynaptically targeted version of the photoactivated adenylyl cyclase bPAC. In cultures of hippocampal granule cells, activation of synaptoPAC with blue light increases action potential-evoked transmission, an effect not seen in hippocampal cultures of non-granule cells. In acute brain slices, synaptoPAC activation immediately triggers a strong presynaptic potentiation at mossy fiber terminals in CA3, but not at Schaffer collateral synapse in CA1. Following light-triggered potentiation, mossy fiber transmission decreases within 20 minutes, but remains enhanced still after 30 min. Optogenetic potentiation alters the short-term plasticity dynamics of release, reminiscent of presynaptic LTP. SynaptoPAC is the first optogenetic tool that allows acute light-controlled potentiation of transmitter release at specific synapses of the brain, and will enable to investigate the role of presynaptic potentiation in network function and the animals behavior in an unprecedented manner.\n\nSignificance StatementSynaptoPAC is a novel optogenetic tool that allows increasing synaptic transmission by light-controlled induction of presynaptic plasticity.",

    "abstract": "The shape of a neuron reflects its cellular function and ultimately, how it operates in neural circuits. Dendrites receive and integrate incoming signals, including excitatory input onto dendritic spines, so understanding how dendritic development proceeds is fundamental for discerning neural function. Using loss- and gain-of-function paradigms, we previously demonstrated that EphA7 receptor signaling during cortical development impacts dendrites in two ways: restricting growth early and promoting spine formation later. Here, the molecular basis for this shift in EphA7 function is defined. Expression analyses reveal that both full-length (EphA7-FL) and truncated (EphA7-T1; lacking kinase domain) isoforms of EphA7 are expressed in the developing cortex, with peak expression of EphA7-FL overlapping with dendritic elaboration and highest levels of EphA7-T1 coinciding with spine formation. Overexpression studies in cultured neurons demonstrate that EphA7-FL inhibits both dendritic growth and spine formation, while EphA7-T1 increases spine density. Furthermore, signaling downstream of EphA7 varies during development; in vivo inhibition of kinase-dependent mTOR by rapamycin in EphA7 mutant neurons rescues the dendritic branching, but not the dendritic spine phenotypes. Finally, interaction and signaling modulation was examined. In cells in culture, direct interaction between EphA7-FL and EphA7-T1 is demonstrated which results in EphA7- T1-based modulation of EphA7-FL phosphorylation. In vivo, both isoforms are colocalized to cortical synapses and levels of phosphorylated EphA7-FL decrease as EphA7-T1 levels rise. Thus, the phenotypes of EphA7 during cortical dendrite development are explained by divergent functions of two variants of the receptor.",

The comparison of EDX spectra obtained for the three different ordered structures revealed that in nanocrystalline formation the majority of Dps protein is tightly bound to nucleoid DNA.
