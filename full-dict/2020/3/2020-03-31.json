    "abstract": "The human superior temporal plane, the site of the auditory cortex, displays a high inter-individual macro-anatomical variation. This questions the validity of curvature based alignment (CBA) methods for in vivo imaging data. Here, we have addressed this issue by developing CBA+, which is a cortical surface registration method that uses prior macro-anatomical knowledge. We validate this method by using cyto-architectonic areas on ten individual brains (which we make publicly available). Compared to volumetric and standard surface registration, CBA+ results in a more accurate cyto-architectonic auditory atlas. The improved correspondence of micro-anatomy following the improved alignment of macro-anatomy validates the superiority of CBA+ compared to CBA. In addition, we use CBA+ to align in vivo and post mortem data. This allows projection of functional and anatomical information collected in vivo onto the cyto-architectonic areas, which has potential to contribute to ongoing debate on the parcellation of the human auditory cortex.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in neuroscience have challenged the view of conscious visual perception as a continuous process. Behavioral performance, reaction times and some visual illusions all undergo periodic fluctuations that can be traced back to oscillatory activity in the brain. These findings have given rise to the idea of a discrete sampling mechanism in the visual system. In this study we seek to investigate the causal relationship between occipital alpha oscillations and Temporal Order Judgements using neural entrainment via rhythmic TMS. We find that certain phases of the entrained oscillation facilitate temporal order perception of two visual stimuli, whereas others hinder it. Our findings support the idea that the visual system periodically compresses information into discrete packages within which temporal order information is lost.\n\nSignificance StatementCorrelational evidence for a relationship between brain states and perception is abundant. However, in order to truly understand the causal relationship between the two, we need to be able to manipulate one and observe changes in the other. Neural entrainment via TMS serves as a valuable tool to interfere with cortical rhythms and observe changes in perception. Here, using rhythmic TMS-pulses at 10 Hz, we investigate the effect of the phase of entrained oscillations on performance in a temporal order judgement (TOJ) task. We observe that the causally entrained oscillation indeed modulates time perception rhythmically. On top of previous work on discrete perception we were able to 1. causally influence brain rhythms in a far more direct fashion using TMS, and 2. show that previous work on discrete perception cannot simply be explained by rhythmic fluctuations in visibility. In conclusion our findings support the long discussed idea that the temporal organization of visual processing is discrete rather than continuous, and is causally modulated by cortical rhythms. To our knowledge, this is the first study providing causal evidence via TMS for an endogenous periodic modulation of time perception.",

    "abstract": "Humans and other primates explore visual scenes by active sensing, using saccadic eye movements to relocate the fovea and sample different bits of information multiple times per second. Saccades induce a phase reset of ongoing neuronal oscillations in primary and higher-order visual cortices and medial temporal lobe. As a result, neuron ensembles are shifted to a common state at the time visual input propagates through the system (i.e., just after fixation). The extent of the brains circuitry modulated by saccades is not yet known. Here, we evaluate the possibility that saccadic phase reset impacts the anterior nuclei of the thalamus (ANT). Using rare recordings in the human thalamus of three surgical patients, we found saccade-related phase concentration, peaking at 3-4 Hz, coincident with suppression of Broadband High-frequency Activity (BHA; 80-180 Hz). Our results provide evidence for saccade-related modulation of neuronal excitability dynamics in the ANT, consistent with the idea that these nuclei are engaged during visual active sensing. These findings show that during real-world active visual exploration neural dynamics in the human ANT, a part of extended hippocampal-diencephalic system for episodic memory, exhibit modulations that might be underestimated in typical passive viewing.",

    "abstract": "Ferroptosis, a form of regulated necrotic cell death, plays roles in diverse physiological processes and diseases. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance (HAIR) and an increased risk of miscarriage and placental dysfunction during pregnancy. However, whether maternal HAIR alters mechanisms leading to ferroptosis in the gravid uterus and placenta remains unknown. Previous studies in rats showed that maternal exposure to 5-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and insulin (INS) from gestational day 7.5 to 13.5 induces HAIR and subsequently leads to placental insufficiency and fetal loss. We therefore hypothesized that maternal HAIR triggers ferroptosis in the uterus and placenta in association with fetal loss in pregnant rats. Compared with controls, we found that co-exposure to DHT and INS led to decreased levels of Gpx4 and glutathione (GSH), increased GSH+glutathione disulfide (GSSG) and malondialdehyde (MDA), aberrant expression of ferroptosis-associated genes (Acsl4, Tfrc, Slc7a11, and Gclc), increased iron deposition, and activated ERK/p38/JNK phosphorylation in the gravid uterus. However, in the placenta, DHT and INS exposure only partially altered the expression of ferroptosis-related markers (e.g., region-dependent Gpx4, GSH+GSSG, MDA, Gls2 and Slc7a11 mRNAs, and phosphorylated p38 levels). In the uteri co-exposed to DHT and INS, we also observed shrunken mitochondria with electron-dense cristae, which are key features of ferroptosis-related mitochondrial morphology, as well as increased expression of Dpp4, a mitochondria-encoded gene responsible for ferroptosis induction. In contrast, in placentas co-exposed to DHT and INS we found decreased expression of Dpp4 mRNA and increased expression of Cisd1 mRNA (a mitochondria-encoded iron-export factor). Further, DHT+INS-exposed pregnant rats exhibited decreased apoptosis in the uterus and increased necroptosis in the placenta. Our findings suggest that maternal HAIR causes the activation of ferroptosis in the gravid uterus and placenta, although this is mediated via different mechanisms operating at the molecular and cellular levels. Furthermore, our data suggest other cell death pathways may play a role in coordinating or compensating for HAIR-induced ferroptosis when the gravid uterus and placenta are dysfunctional.\n\nSuppl Figures: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.11794059.v5",

    "abstract": "The factors mediating fatal SARS-CoV-2 infections are poorly understood. Here, we show that cigarette smoke causes a dose-dependent upregulation of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, in rodent and human lungs. Using single-cell sequencing data, we demonstrate that ACE2 is expressed in a subset of secretory cells in the respiratory tract. Chronic smoke exposure triggers the expansion of this cell population and a concomitant increase in ACE2 expression. In contrast, quitting smoking decreases the abundance of these secretory cells and reduces ACE2 levels. Finally, we demonstrate that ACE2 expression is responsive to inflammatory signaling and can be upregulated by viral infections or interferon treatment. Taken together, these results may partially explain why smokers are particularly susceptible to severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. Furthermore, our work identifies ACE2 as an interferon-stimulated gene in lung cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infections could create positive-feedback loops that increase ACE2 levels and facilitate viral dissemination.",

    "abstract": "The outbreak of COVID-19 has now become a global pandemic and it continues to spread rapidly worldwide, severely threatening lives and economic stability. Making the problem worse, there is no specific antiviral drug that can be used to treat COVID-19 to date. SARS-CoV-2 initiates its entry into human cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) via the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein. Therefore, molecules that can block SARS-CoV-2 from binding to hACE2 may potentially prevent the virus from entering human cells and serve as an effective antiviral drug. Based on this idea, we designed a series of peptides that can strongly bind to SARS-CoV-2 RBD in computational experiments. Specifically, we first constructed a 31-mer peptidic scaffold by linking two fragments grafted from hACE2 (a.a. 22-44 and 351-357) with a linker glycine, and then redesigned the peptide sequence to enhance its binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Compared with several computational studies that failed to identify that SARS-CoV-2 shows higher binding affinity for hACE2 than SARS-CoV, our protein design scoring function, EvoEF2, makes a correct identification, which is consistent with the recently reported experimental data, implying its high accuracy. The top designed peptide binders exhibited much stronger binding potency to hACE2 than the wild-type (-53.35 vs. -46.46 EvoEF2 energy unit for design and wild-type, respectively). The extensive and detailed computational analyses support the high reasonability of the designed binders, which not only recapitulated the critical native binding interactions but also introduced new favorable interactions to enhance binding. Due to the urgent situation created by COVID-19, we share these computational data to the community, which should be helpful to develop potential antiviral peptide drugs to combat this pandemic.",

This would be incredible, since that would be the lowest biomass sample ever analyzed for gene expression for a deep biosphere sample by several orders of magnitude. However, I have reanalyzed the data and show that the authors data are derived from contamination via seawater, humans, human skin associated bacteria, drilling fluid, and molecular reagent kits. The method that the authors used to produce their gene expression data is highly sensitive to DNA contamination, which is the case here. The authors claim that Pseudomonas, a known widespread contaminant in molecular reagent kits, is one of the most active groups in their lower crust samples and base their metabolic analysis on this contaminating organism. Here, I show that the gene expression data are derived from contaminating Pseudomonas (as well as other groups), and I show that the groups claimed as being active in the rock samples are also present in the negative controls at similar or higher relative abundance. For example, methane production in long term incubations was reported but gene expression from methanogens was 10 times higher in the drill fluid negative controls compared to the rock samples, demonstrating that the methane measured is likely derived from methanogen contaminants introduced from the drill fluid. There are no signs of active life here, but lipid biomarkers were found preserved in the rocks. Thus, the authors have sampled a fossilized biosphere, not a living one.",

We demonstrate two modes of RTX use \u2013 (i) dye-based RT-qPCR assays that require only RTX polymerase, and (ii) TaqMan RT-qPCR assays that use a combination of RTX and Taq DNA polymerases (as the RTX exonuclease does not degrade a TaqMan probe).

We anticipate that in low resource or point-of-need settings researchers could obtain the available constructs from Addgene or our lab and begin to develop their own assays, within whatever regulatory framework exists for them.We lay out protocols for dye-based and TaqMan probe-based assays, in order to best compare with \u2018gold standard\u2019 reagents.

    "abstract": "Cells sense and react on changes of the mechanical properties of their environment, and likewise respond to external mechanical stress applied to them. Whether the gravitational field, as overall body force, modulates cellular behavior is however unclear. Different studies demonstrated that micro- and hypergravity influences the shape and elasticity of cells, initiate cytoskeleton reorganization, and influence cell motility. All these cellular properties are interconnected, and contribute to forces that cells apply on their surrounding microenvironment. Yet, studies that investigated changes of cell traction forces under hypergravity conditions are scarce. Here we performed hypergravity experiments on 3T3 fibroblast cells using the Large Diameter Centrifuge at the European Space and Technology Centre (ESA-ESTEC). cells were exposed to hypergravity of up to 19.5g for 16 h in both the upright and the inverted orientation with respect to the g-force vector. We observed a decrease in cellular traction forces when the gravitational field was increased up to 5.4g, followed by an increase of traction forces for higher gravity fields up to 19.5g independent of the orientation of the gravity vector. We attribute the switch in cellular response to shear-thinning at low g-forces, followed by significant rearrangement and enforcement of the cytoskeleton at high g-forces.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEThe behavior of cells critically depend on the mechanical properties of their environment. For example external stresses and strains lead to decisions in cell differentiation as well as to collective-migration in metastasis. Gravity, as a permanently acting body force, is one of those externs stresses. We demonstrate the impact of gravitational challenges on forces that cells apply to their environment. We observed a switch in cellular response with a decrease in cell traction forces for low bypgrarayiv. conditions, followed by a significant increase in cell traction forces at higher g-level. This particular cellular response reflects a switch in croskeletal organization, similar to that observed for cells in fluids where shear forces act.",

    "abstract": "MotivationUnderstanding how cell cycle responds and adapts dynamically to a broad range of stresses and changes in the cellular environment is crucial for the treatment of various pathologies, including cancer. However, measuring changes in cell cycle progression is experimentally challenging, and model inference computationally expensive.\n\nResultsHere, we introduce a computational framework that allows the inference of changes in cell cycle progression from static single-cell measurements. We modeled population dynamics with partial differential equations (PDE), and derive parameter gradients to estimate time- and cell cycle position-dependent progression changes efficiently. Additionally, we show that computing parameter sensitivities for the optimization problem by solving a system of PDEs is computationally feasible and allows efficient and exact estimation of parameters. We showcase our framework by estimating the changes in cell cycle progression in K562 cells treated with Nocodazole and identify an arrest in M-phase transition that matches the expected behavior of microtubule polymerization inhibition.\n\nConclusionsOur results have two major implications: First, this framework can be scaled to high-throughput compound screens, providing a fast, stable, and efficient protocol to generate new insights into changes in cell cycle progression. Second, knowledge of the cell cycle stage- and time-dependent progression function allows transformation from pseudotime to real-time thereby enabling real-time analysis of molecular rates in response to treatments.\n\nAvailabilityMAPiT toolbox (Karsten Kuritz 2020) is available at github: https://github.com/karstenkuritz/MAPiT.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP) serve as one of the key components in the global proteome. In contrast to the dominant class of cytosolic globular proteins, they harbor an enormous amount of physical flexibility and structural plasticity enforcing them to be retained in conformational ensembles rather than well defined stable folds. Previous studies in an aligned direction have revealed the importance of transient dynamical phenomena like that of saltbridge formation in IDPs to support their physical flexibility and have further highlighted their functional relevance. For this characteristic flexibility, IDPs remain amenable and accessible to different ordered binding partners, supporting their potential multi-functionality. The current study further addresses this complex structure-functional interplay in IDPs using phase transition dynamics to conceptualize the underlying (avalanche type) mechanism of their being distributed across and hopping around degenerate structural states (conformational ensembles). For this purpose, extensive molecular dynamics simulations have been done and the data analyzed from a statistical physics perspective. Investigation of the plausible scope  selforganized criticality (SOC) to fit into the complex dynamics of IDPs was found to be assertive, relating the conformational degeneracy of these proteins to their multi-functionality. In accordance with the transient nature of  salt-bridge dynamics, the study further uses it as a probe to explain the structural basis of the proposed criticality in the conformational phase transition among self-similar groups in IDPs. The analysis reveal scale-invariant self-similar fractal geometries in structural conformations of different IDPs. Also, as discussed in the conclusion, the study has the potential to benefit structural tinkering of bio-medically relevant IDPs in the design of biotherapeutics against them.",

    "abstract": "MotivationSingle cell data measures multiple cellular markers at the single-cell level for thousands to millions of cells. Identification of distinct cell populations is a key step for further biological understanding, usually performed by clustering this data. Dimensionality reduction based clustering tools are either not scalable to large datasets containing millions of cells, or not fully automated requiring an initial manual estimation of the number of clusters. Graph clustering tools provide automated and reliable clustering for single cell data, but suffer heavily from scalability to large datasets.\n\nResultsWe developed SCHNEL, a scalable, reliable and automated clustering tool for high-dimensional single-cell data. SCHNEL transforms large high-dimensional data to a hierarchy of datasets containing subsets of data points following the original data manifold. The novel approach of SCHNEL combines this hierarchical representation of the data with graph clustering, making graph clustering scalable to millions of cells. Using seven different cytometry datasets, SCHNEL outperformed three popular clustering tools for cytometry data, and was able to produce meaningful clustering results for datasets of 3.5 and 17.2 million cells within workable timeframes. In addition, we show that SCHNEL is a general clustering tool by applying it to single-cell RNA sequencing data, as well as a popular machine learning benchmark dataset MNIST.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationImplementation is available on GitHub (https://github.com/paulderaadt/HSNE-clustering)\n\nContacta.mahfouz@lumc.nl\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "While there are >2 million publicly-available human microarray gene-expression profiles, these profiles were measured using a variety of platforms that each cover a pre-defined, limited set of genes. Therefore, key to reanalyzing and integrating this massive data collection are methods that can computationally reconstitute the complete transcriptome in partially-measured microarray samples by imputing the expression of unmeasured genes. Current state-of-the-art imputation methods are tailored to samples from a specific platform and rely on gene-gene relationships regardless of the biological context of the target sample. We show that sparse regression models that capture sample-sample relationships (termed SampleLASSO), built on-the-fly for each new target sample to be imputed, outperform models based on fixed gene relationships. Extensive evaluation involving three machine learning algorithms (LASSO, k-nearest-neighbors, and deep-neural-networks), two gene subsets (GPL96-570 and LINCS), and three imputation tasks (within and across microarray/RNA-seq) establishes that SampleLASSO is the most accurate model. Additionally, we demonstrate the biological interpretability of this method by showing that, for imputing a target sample from a certain tissue, SampleLASSO automatically leverages training samples from the same tissue. Thus, SampleLASSO is a simple, yet powerful and flexible approach for harmonizing large-scale gene-expression data.",

    "abstract": "Molecular chaperone Hsp70 plays important roles in the pathology of amyloid diseases by inhibiting aberrant aggregation of proteins. However, mechanism of the interactions of Hsp70 with the amyloidogenic intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) is not clear. Here, we use Hsp70 from different organisms to show that it inhibits aggregation of Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) at substoichiometric concentrations even in absence of ATP. The effect is found to be the strongest if Hsp70 is added in the beginning of aggregation but progressively less if added later, indicating role of Hsp70 in preventing primary nucleation possibly via interactions with the prefibrillar oligomers of IAPP. Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) measurements of the solutions containing fluorescently labelled Hsp70 and IAPP exhibit fluorescence bursts suggesting formation of heterogeneous complexes of oligomeric IAPP binding to multiple molecules of Hsp70. Size exclusion chromatography and field flow fractionation are then used to fractionate the smaller complexes. Multiangle light scattering and FCS measurements suggest that these complexes comprise of monomers of Hsp70 and small oligomers of IAPP. However, concentration of the complexes is measured to be a few nanomolar amidst several molar of free Hsp70 and IAPP. Hence, our results indicate that Hsp70 interacts poorly with the monomers but strongly with oligomers of IAPP. This is likely a common feature of the interactions between the chaperones and the amyloidogenic IDPs. While strong interactions with the oligomers prevent aberrant aggregation, poor interaction with the monomers avert interference with the functions of the IDPs.",

While physical probes and devices revealed cellular mechano-responses, how force is translated inside cells to exert output functions remains largely unknown, due to the limited techniques to manipulate force intracellularly. By engineering an ActA protein, an actin nucleation promoting factor derived from Listeria monocytogenes, and implementing this in protein dimerization paradigms, we developed a molecular tool termed ActuAtor, with which actin polymerization can be triggered at intended subcellular locations to generate constrictive force in a rapidly inducible manner. The ActuAtor operation led to striking deformation of target intracellular structures including mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, nucleus, and non-membrane-bound RNA granules. Based on functional analysis before and after organelle deformation, we found the form-function relationship of mitochondria to be generally marginal. The modular design and genetically-encoded nature enable wide applications of ActuAtor for studies of intracellular mechanobiology processes.",

    "abstract": "Mechanotransduction events in physiological environments are difficult to investigate, in part due to the lack of experimental tools to apply forces to mechanosensitive receptors remotely. Inspired by cellular mechanisms for force application (i.e. motor proteins pulling on cytoskeletal fibers), here we present a unique molecular machine that can apply forces at cell-matrix and cell-cell junctions using light as an energy source. The key actuator is a light-driven rotatory molecular motor linked to polymer chains, which is intercalated between a membrane receptor and an engineered biointerface. The light-driven actuation of the molecular motor is converted in mechanical twisting of the polymer chains, which will in turn effectively \"pulls\" on engaged cell membrane receptors (integrins, cadherins...) within the illuminated area. Applied forces have the adequate magnitude and occur at time scales within the relevant ranges for mechanotransduction at cell-friendly exposure conditions, as demonstrated in forcedependent focal adhesion maturation and T cell activation experiments. Our results reveal the potential of nanomotors for the manipulation of living cells at the molecular scale and demonstrate, for the first time, a functionality which at the moment cannot be achieved by any other means.",

    "abstract": "Retromer is a protein sorting device that orchestrates the selection and export of integral membrane proteins from the endosome via retrograde and plasma membrane recycling pathways. Long standing hypotheses regarding the Retromer sorting mechanism posit that oligomeric interactions between Retromer and associated accessory factors on the endosome membrane drives clustering of Retromer-bound integral membrane cargo prior to its packaging into a nascent transport carrier. To test this hypothesis, we examined interactions between the components of the SNX3-Retromer sorting pathway using quantitative single particle fluorescence microscopy of a reconstituted system comprising a supported bilayer, Retromer, a model cargo protein, the accessory proteins SNX3, RAB7, and the Retromer-binding segment of the WASHC2C subunit of the WASH complex. The predominant species of membrane associated Retromer are low order: monomers ([~]18%), dimers ([~]35%), trimers ([~]24%) and tetramers ([~]24%). Unexpectedly, neither cargo nor accessory factors promote Retromer oligomerization on a supported bilayer. The results indicate that Retromer has an intrinsic propensity to form low order oligomers and that neither membrane association nor accessory factors potentiate oligomerization. Hence, Retromer is a minimally concentrative sorting device adapted to bulk membrane trafficking from the endosomal system.",

A number of candidate susceptibility genes have been identified, some of which are linked to the function of the cilium, an organelle regulating left-right asymmetry development in the embryo. Furthermore, it has been suggested that disrupted left-right asymmetry of the brain may play a role in neurodevelopmental disorders such as DD.\n\nMethodsHere, we studied two individuals with co-occurring situs inversus (SI) and DD using whole genome sequencing to identify single nucleotide variants or copy number variations of importance for DD and SI.\n\nResultsIndividual 1 had primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a rare, autosomal recessive disorder with oto-sino-pulmonary phenotype and SI. We identified two rare nonsynonymous variants in the dynein axonemal heavy chain 5 gene (DNAH5): c.7502G>C;p.(R2501P), a previously reported variant predicted to be damaging and c.12043T>G;p.(Y4015D), a novel variant predicted to be damaging. Ultrastructural analysis of the cilia revealed a lack of outer dynein arms and normal inner dynein arms. MRI of the brain revealed no significant abnormalities. Individual 2 had non-syndromic SI and DD. In individual 2, one rare variant (c.9110A>G;p.(H3037R)) in the dynein axonemal heavy chain 11 gene (DNAH11), coding for another component of the outer dynein arm, was identified.\n\nConclusionsWe identified the likely genetic cause of SI and PCD in one individual, and a possibly significant heterozygosity in the other, both involving dynein genes. Given the present evidence, it is unclear if the identified variants also predispose to DD, but further studies into the association are warranted.",

    "abstract": "The use of transposons to create mutants has been the cornerstone of Drosophila genetics in the past few decades. Transpositions often create second-site mutations, devoid of transposon insertion and thereby affect subsequent phenotype analyses. In a P-element mutagenesis screen, a second site mutant was discovered on chromosome 3 wherein the homozygous mutant individuals show the classic hallmarks of mutations in tumor suppressor genes including brain tumour and lethality, hence the mutant line was initially named as lethal (3) tumorous brain [l(3)tb]. Classical genetic approaches relying on meiotic recombination and subsequent complementation with chromosomal deletions and gene mutations mapped the mutation to CG6169, the mRNA decapping protein 2 (DCP2), on the left arm of the third chromosome (3L), and thus the mutation was renamed as DCP2l(3)tb. Fine mapping of the mutation further identified the presence of a Gypsy-LTR like sequence in the 5UTR coding region of DCP2, alongwith expansion of the adjacent upstream intergenic AT-rich sequence. The mutant phenotypes are rescued by Introduction of a functional copy of DCP2 in the mutant background, thereby establishing the causal role of the mutation and providing a genetic validation of the allelism. With the increasing repertoire of genes being associated with tumor biology this is the first instance that the mRNA decapping protein is being implicated in Drosophila tumourigenesis. Our findings therefore imply a plausible role for mRNA degradation pathway in tumorigenesis and identify DCP2 as a potential candidate for future explorations of cell cycle regulatory mechanisms.",

Like many other teleosts, Nile tilapia and blue tilapia exhibit very recent transition of sex chromosome systems since their divergence about 5 million years ago, making them a great model for elucidating the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms of sex chromosome turnovers. Studies into their sex-determining pathways are also critical for developing genetic sex control in aquaculture.\n\nResultsWe report here the newly produced genomes of Nile tilapia and blue tilapia that integrate long-read sequencing and chromatin conformation data. The two nearly complete genomes have anchored over 97% of the sequences into linkage groups (LGs), and assembled majorities of complex repetitive regions including telomeres, centromeres and rDNA clusters. In particular, we inferred two episodes of repeat expansion at LG3 respectively in the ancestor of cichlids and that of tilapias. The consequential large heterochromatic region concentrated at one end of LG3 comprises tandem arrays of mRNA and small RNA genes, among which we have identified a candidate female determining gene Paics in blue tilapia. Paics show female-specific patterns of single-nucleotide variants, copy numbers and expression patterns in gonads during early gonadogenesis.\n\nConclusionsOur work provide a very important genomic resource for functional studies of cichlids, and suggested that unequal distribution of repeat content that impacts the local recombination rate might make some chromosomes more likely to become sex chromosomes.",

    "abstract": "The cGAS-STING pathway is a major mechanism that mammalian cells utilize to detect cytoplasmic dsDNA from incoming viruses, bacteria, or self. CYCLIC GMP-AMP SYNTHASE (cGAS) is the sensor protein that directly binds dsDNAs. cGAS synthesizes cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which binds to the adaptor STIMULATOR OF INTERFERON GENES (STING), activating an INTERFERON REGULATORY FACTOR 3 (IRF3)-mediated immune response. Constitutive activation can result in interferonopathies such as Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome (AGS) or other lupus-like autoimmune disorders. While inhibitors targeting mouse or human cGAS have been reported, the identification of a small molecule that targets both homologs of cGAS has been challenging. Here, we show that RU.521 is capable of potently and selectively inhibiting mouse and human cGAS in cell lines and human primary cells. This inhibitory activity requires the presence of cGAS, but it cannot suppress an immune response in cells activated by RNA, Toll-like receptor ligands, cGAMP, or recombinant interferon. Importantly, when RU.521 is applied to cells, the production of dsDNA-induced intracellular cGAMP is suppressed in a dose-dependent manner. Our work validates the use of RU.521 for probing DNA-induced innate immune responses and underscores its potential as an ideal scaffold towards pre-clinical development, given its potency against human and mouse cGAS.",

Here, we show that patient-derived GSCs, but not normal astrocytes, are highly sensitive to lysis by healthy allogeneic natural killer (NK) cells in vitro. In contrast, single cell analysis of autologous, tissue infiltrating NK cells isolated from surgical samples of high-grade glioblastoma patient tumors using mass cytometry and single cell RNA sequencing revealed an abnormal phenotype associated with impaired lytic function compared with peripheral blood NK cells from GBM patients or healthy donors. This immunosuppression was attributed to an integrin-TGF-{beta} mechanism, activated by direct cell-cell contact between GSCs and NK cells. Treatment of GSC-engrafted mice with allogeneic NK cells in combination with inhibitors of integrin or TGF-{beta} signaling, or with TGF-{beta} receptor 2 gene-edited NK cells prevented GSC-induced NK cell dysfunction and tumor growth. Collectively, our findings reveal a novel mechanism of NK cell immune evasion by GSCs and implicate the integrin-TGF-{beta} axis as a useful therapeutic target to eliminate GSCs in this devastating tumor.",

Many of these perturbations constrained the growth of intracellular mycobacteria. We identified over 100 genes associated with diverse biological pathways as potential HDT targets. We validated key components of the type I interferon and aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling pathways that respond to the small-molecule inhibitors cerdulatinib and CH223191, respectively; these inhibitors enhanced human macrophage survival and limited the intracellular growth of Mtb. Thus, high-throughput functional genomic screens can elucidate highly complex host-pathogen interactions and serve to identify HDTs with the potential to improve TB treatment.",

    "abstract": "Brown adipocytes store metabolic energy as triglycerides (TG) in multilocular lipid droplets (LDs). Fatty acids released from brown adipocyte LDs by lipolysis are thought to activate and fuel UCP1-mediated thermogenesis. Here we test this hypothesis by preventing fatty acid storage in murine brown adipocytes through brown adipose tissue (BAT)-specific deletions of the TG synthesis enzymes, DGAT1 and DGAT2 (BA-DGAT KO). Despite the absence of LDs, BA-DGAT KO mice had functional BAT and maintained euthermia during acute or chronic cold exposure. As apparent adaptations to the lack of TG, brown adipocytes of BA-DGAT KO mice appear to utilize circulating glucose and fatty acids, as well as stored glycogen to fuel thermogenesis. Moreover, BA-DGAT KO mice were resistant to diet-induced glucose intolerance, likely due to increased glucose disposal by BAT. Thus, surprisingly, TGs in BAT are dispensable for its function, in part through adaptations to utilize other fuel sources.",

    "abstract": "The chloroplastic oxaloacetate/malate transporter (OMT1 or DiT1) takes part in the malate valve that protects chloroplasts from excessive redox poise through export of malate and import of oxaloacetate (OAA). Together with the glutamate/malate transporter (DCT1 or DiT2), it connects carbon with nitrogen assimilation, by providing -ketoglutarate for the GS/GOGAT reaction and exporting glutamate to the cytoplasm. OMT1 further plays a prominent role in C4 photosynthesis. OAA resulting from PEP-carboxylation is imported into the chloroplast, reduced to malate by plastidic NADP-MDH, and then exported for transport to bundle sheath cells. Both transport steps are catalyzed by OMT1, at the rate of net carbon assimilation. Therefore, to engineer C4 photosynthesis into C3 crops, OMT1 must be expressed in high amounts on top of core C4 metabolic enzymes. We report here high-level expression of ZmOMT1 from maize in rice (Oryza sativa ssp. indica IR64). Increased activity of the transporter in transgenic rice was confirmed by reconstitution of transporter activity into proteoliposomes. Unexpectedly, over-expression of ZmOMT1 in rice negatively affected growth, CO2 assimilation rate, total free amino acid contents, TCA cycle metabolites, as well as sucrose and starch contents. Accumulation of high amounts of aspartate and the impaired growth phenotype of OMT1 rice lines could be suppressed by simultaneous over-expression of ZmDiT2. Implications for engineering C4-rice are discussed.",

    "abstract": "DNA replication is a complex and remarkably robust process: despite its inherent uncertainty, manifested through stochastic replication timing at a single-cell level, multiple control mechanisms ensure its accurate and timely completion across a population. Disruptions in these mechanisms lead to DNA re-replication, closely connected to genomic instability and oncogenesis. We present a stochastic hybrid model of DNA re-replication that accurately portrays the interplay between discrete dynamics, continuous dynamics, and uncertainty. Using experimental data on the fission yeast genome, model simulations show how different regions respond to re-replication, and permit insight into the key mechanisms affecting re-replication dynamics. Simulated and experimental population-level profiles exhibit good correlation along the genome, which is robust to model parameters, validating our approach. At a single-cell level, copy numbers of individual loci are affected by intrinsic properties of each locus, in cis effects from adjoining loci and in trans effects from distant loci. In silico analysis and single-cell imaging reveal that cell-to-cell heterogeneity is inherent in re-replication and can lead to a plethora of genotypic variations. Our thorough in silico analysis of DNA re-replication across a complete genome reveals that heterogeneity at the single cell level and robustness at the population level are emerging and co-existing principles of DNA re-replication. Our results indicate that re-replication can promote genome plasticity by generating many diverse genotypes within a population, potentially offering an evolutionary advantage in cells with aberrations in replication control mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The Roundabout (Robo) family of axon guidance receptors has a conserved ectodomain arrangement of five immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains plus three fibronectin (Fn) repeats. Based on the strong evolutionary conservation of this domain structure among Robo receptors, as well as in vitro structural and domain-domain interaction studies of Robo family members, this ectodomain arrangement is predicted to be important for Robo receptor signaling in response to Slit ligands. Here, we define the minimal ectodomain structure required for Slit binding and midline repulsive signaling in vivo by Drosophila Robo1. We find that the majority of the Robo1 ectodomain is dispensable for both Slit binding and repulsive signaling. We show that a significant level of midline repulsive signaling activity is retained when all Robo1 ectodomain elements apart from Ig1 are deleted, and that the combination of Ig1 plus one additional ectodomain element (Ig2, Ig5, or Fn3) is sufficient to restore midline repulsion to wild type levels. Further, we find that deleting four out of five Robo1 Ig domains ({Delta}Ig2-5) does not affect negative regulation of Robo1 by Commissureless (Comm) or Robo2, while variants lacking all three fibronectin repeats ({Delta}Fn1-3 and {Delta}Ig2-Fn3) are insensitive to regulation by both Comm and Robo2, signifying a novel regulatory role for Robo1s Fn repeats. Our results provide an in vivo perspective on the importance of the conserved 5+3 ectodomain structure of Robo receptors, and suggest that specific biochemical properties and/or ectodomain structural conformations observed in vitro for domains other than Ig1 may have limited significance for in vivo signaling in the context of midline repulsion.",

    "abstract": "There are outstanding evolutionary questions on the recent emergence of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2/hCoV-19 in Hubei province that caused the COVID-19 pandemic, including (1) the relationship of the new virus to the SARS-related coronaviruses, (2) the role of bats as a reservoir species, (3) the potential role of other mammals in the emergence event, and (4) the role of recombination in viral emergence. Here, we address these questions and find that the sarbecoviruses - the viral subgenus responsible for the emergence of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 - exhibit frequent recombination, but the SARS-CoV-2 lineage itself is not a recombinant of any viruses detected to date. In order to employ phylogenetic methods to date the divergence events between SARS-CoV-2 and the bat sarbecovirus reservoir, recombinant regions of a 68-genome sarbecovirus alignment were removed with three independent methods. Bayesian evolutionary rate and divergence date estimates were consistent for all three recombination-free alignments and robust to two different prior specifications based on HCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV evolutionary rates. Divergence dates between SARS-CoV-2 and the bat sarbecovirus reservoir were estimated as 1948 (95% HPD: 1879-1999), 1969 (95% HPD: 1930-2000), and 1982 (95% HPD: 1948-2009). Despite intensified characterization of sarbecoviruses since SARS, the lineage giving rise to SARS-CoV-2 has been circulating unnoticed for decades in bats and been transmitted to other hosts such as pangolins. The occurrence of a third significant coronavirus emergence in 17 years together with the high prevalence and virus diversity in bats implies that these viruses are likely to cross species boundaries again.\n\nIn BriefThe Betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the sarbecovirus subgenus which shows frequent recombination in its evolutionary history. We characterize the extent of this genetic exchange and identify non-recombining regions of the sarbecovirus genome using three independent methods to remove the effects of recombination. Using these non-recombining genome regions and prior information on coronavirus evolutionary rates, we obtain estimates from three approaches that the most likely divergence date of SARS-CoV-2 from its most closely related available bat sequences ranges from 1948 to 1982.\n\nKey PointsO_LIRaTG13 is the closest available bat virus to SARS-CoV-2; a sub-lineage of these bat viruses is able to infect humans. Two sister lineages of the RaTG13/SARS-CoV-2 lineage infect Malayan pangolins.\nC_LIO_LIThe sarbecoviruses show a pattern of deep recombination events, indicating that there are high levels of co-infection in horseshoe bats and that the viral pool can generate novel allele combinations and substantial genetic diversity; the sarbecoviruses are efficient  explorers of phenotype space.\nC_LIO_LIThe SARS-CoV-2 lineage is not a recent recombinant, at least not involving any of the bat or pangolin viruses sampled to date.\nC_LIO_LINon-recombinant regions of the sarbecoviruses can be identified, allowing for phylogenetic inference and dating to be performed. We constructed three such regions using different methods.\nC_LIO_LIWe estimate that RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 diverged 40 to 70 years ago. There is a diverse unsampled reservoir of generalist viruses established in horseshoe bats.\nC_LIO_LIWhile an intermediate host responsible for the zoonotic event cannot be ruled out, the relevant evolution for spillover to humans very likely occurred in horseshoe bats.\nC_LI",

Here, we calculated the secondary structure content of >2000 coronaviruses and computed >100000 human protein interactions with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The genomic regions display different degrees of conservation. SARS-CoV-2 domain encompassing nucleotides 22500 - 23000 is conserved both at the sequence and structural level. The regions upstream and downstream, however, vary significantly. This part codes for the Spike S protein that interacts with the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Thus, variability of Spike S may be connected to different levels of viral entry in human cells within the population.\n\nOur predictions indicate that the 5 end of SARS-CoV-2 is highly structured and interacts with several human proteins. The binding proteins are involved in viral RNA processing such as double-stranded RNA specific editases and ATP-dependent RNA-helicases and have strong propensity to form stress granules and phase-separated complexes.

    "abstract": "In depth evolutionary and structural analyses of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) isolated from bats, pangolins, and humans are necessary to assess the role of natural selection and recombination in the emergence of the current pandemic strain. The SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein unique features have been associated with efficient viral spread in the human population. Phylogeny-based and genetic algorithm methods clearly show that recombination events between viral progenitors infecting animal hosts led to a mosaic structure in the S gene. We identified recombination coldspots in the S glycoprotein and strong purifying selection. Moreover, although there is little evidence of diversifying positive selection during host-switching, structural analysis suggests that some of the residues emerged along the ancestral lineage of current pandemic strains may contribute to enhanced ability to infect human cells. Interestingly, recombination did not affect the long-range covariant movements of SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein monomer in pre-fusion conformation but, on the contrary, could contribute to the observed overall viral efficiency. Our dynamic simulations revealed that the movements between the host cell receptor binding domain (RBD) and the novel furin-like cleavage site are correlated. We identified threonine 333 (under purifying selection), at the beginning of the RBD, as the hinge of the opening/closing mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein monomer functional to hACE2 binding. Our findings support a scenario where ancestral recombination and fixation of amino acid residues in the RBD of the S glycoprotein generated a virus with unique features, capable of extremely efficient infection of the human host.",

SARS-CoV-2 infects mammalian cells by binding to ACE2, a transmembrane protein. Therefore, the conservation of ACE2 and its expression pattern across mammalian species, which are yet to be comprehensively investigated, may provide valuable insights into tracing potential hosts of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nMethodsWe analyzed gene conservation of ACE2 across mammals and collected more than 140 transcriptome datasets from human and common mammalian species, including presumed hosts of SARS-CoV-2 and other animals in close contact with humans. In order to enable comparisons across species and tissues, we used a unified pipeline to quantify and normalize ACE2 expression levels.\n\nResultsWe first found high conservation of ACE2 genes among common mammals at both DNA and peptide levels, suggesting that a broad range of mammalian species can potentially be the hosts of SARS-CoV-2. Next, we showed that high level of ACE2 expression in certain human tissues is consistent with clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we observed that ACE2 expressed in a species-specific manner in the mammals examined. Notably, high expression in skin and eyes in cat and dog suggested that these animals may play roles in transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to humans.\n\nConclusionsThrough building the first atlas of ACE2 expression in pets and livestock, we identified species and tissues susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, yielding novel insights into the viral transmission.",

Herein, we investigated the interactions between ACE2 and human defensins (HDs) specifically secreted by intestinal Paneth cells.

    "abstract": "Synaptic plasticity is believed to be a key physiological mechanism for learning. It is well-established that it depends on pre and postsynaptic activity. However, models that rely solely on pre and postsynaptic activity for synaptic changes have, to date, not been able to account for learning complex tasks that demand credit assignment in hierarchical networks. Here, we show that if synaptic plasticity is regulated by high-frequency bursts of spikes, then neurons higher in a hierarchical circuit can coordinate the plasticity of lower-level connections. Using simulations and mathematical analyses, we demonstrate that, when paired with short-term synaptic dynamics, regenerative activity in the apical dendrites, and synaptic plasticity in feedback pathways, a burst-dependent learning rule can solve challenging tasks that require deep network architectures. Our results demonstrate that well-known properties of dendrites, synapses, and synaptic plasticity are sufficient to enable sophisticated learning in hierarchical circuits.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAnxiety is the most prevalent comorbidity in individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Amygdala reactivity to explicit and implicit threat processing is predictive of anxiety-related symptomatology. The neural mechanisms underlying the link between anxiety and ASD remains elusive.\n\nMethodsIn this fMRI study, we recruited young adults with ASD (N = 31) and matched them with controls, then proceeded to assess their autistic and anxiety traits by the use of the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S), respectively; and scanned their hemodynamic responses, including amygdala, in response to explicit and implicit (backwardly masked) perception of threatening faces.\n\nResultsAs compared to controls, the amygdala reactivity in ASD subjects was significantly lower to explicit threat, but comparable for implicit threat. The correlations of the amygdala reactivity with the AQ and STAI-S were dissociated depending on threat processing (explicit or implicit). Furthermore, the amygdala in ASD relative to controls had a more negative functional connectivity with the superior parietal cortex, fusiform gyrus, and hippocampus for explicit threat, whereas a more positive connectivity with the medial prefrontal cortex, temporal pole, and hippocampus for implicit threat.\n\nConclusionIn ASD, the transmission of socially relevant information along dorsal and ventral neural pathways centered on the amygdala is dissociated depending on explicit and implicit threat processing. This dissociation, ascribed to their failure to compromise pre-existing hyperarousal, might contribute to anxiety in ASD.",

We describe here the development of a phage-displayed single-domain antibody library by grafting naive CDRs into framework regions of an identified human germline IGHV allele. This enabled the isolation of high-affinity single-domain antibodies of fully human origin. The panning using SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S1 as antigens resulted in the identification of antibodies targeting five types of neutralizing or non-neutralizing epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 RBD. These fully human single-domain antibodies bound specifically to SARS-CoV-2 RBD with subnanomolar to low nanomolar affinities. Some of them were found to potently neutralize pseudotyped and live virus, and therefore may represent promising candidates for prophylaxis and therapy of COVID-19. This study also reports unique immunogenic profile of SARS-CoV-2 RBD compared to that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which may have important implications for the development of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWUnderstanding the disease pathogenesis of the novel coronavirus, denoted SARS-CoV-2, is critical to the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. The global propagation of the viral disease, denoted COVID-19 (\"coronavirus disease 2019\"), has unified the scientific community in searching for possible inhibitory small molecules or polypeptides. Given the known interaction between the human ACE2 (\"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2\") protein and the SARS-CoV virus (responsible for the coronavirus outbreak circa. 2003), considerable focus has been directed towards the putative interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and ACE2. However, a more holistic understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 vs. human inter-species interactome promises additional putative protein-protein interactions (PPI) that may be considered targets for the development of inhibitory therapeutics.\n\nTo that end, we leverage two state-of-the-art, sequence-based PPI predictors (PIPE4 & SPRINT) capable of generating the comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 vs. human interactome, comprising approximately 285,000 pairwise predictions. Of these, we identify the high-scoring subset of human proteins predicted to interact with each of the 14 SARS-CoV-2 proteins by both methods, comprising 279 high-confidence putative interactions involving 225 human proteins. Notably, the Spike-ACE2 interaction was the highest ranked for both the PIPE4 and SPRINT predictors, corroborating existing evidence for this PPI. Furthermore, the PIPE-Sites algorithm was used to predict the putative subsequence that might mediate each interaction and thereby inform the design of inhibitory polypeptides intended to disrupt the corresponding host-pathogen interactions.\n\nWe hereby publicly release the comprehensive set of PPI predictions and their corresponding PIPE-Sites landscapes in the following DataVerse repository: 10.5683/SP2/JZ77XA. All data and metadata are released under a CC-BY 4.0 licence. The information provided represents theoretical modeling only and caution should be exercised in its use. It is intended as a resource for the scientific community at large in furthering our understanding of SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is rapidly progressing, the need for the development of an effective vaccine is critical. A promising approach for vaccine development is to generate, through codon pair deoptimization, an attenuated virus. This approach carries the advantage that it only requires limited knowledge specific to the virus in question, other than its genome sequence. Therefore, it is well suited for emerging viruses for which we may not have extensive data. We performed comprehensive in silico analyses of several features of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence (e.g., codon usage, codon pair usage, dinucleotide/junction dinucleotide usage, RNA structure around the frameshift region) in comparison with other members of the coronaviridae family of viruses, the overall human genome, and the transcriptome of specific human tissues such as lung, which are primarily targeted by the virus. Our analysis identified the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins as promising targets for deoptimization and suggests a roadmap for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development, which can be generalizable to other viruses.",

The candidate vaccine showed an average of [&ge;] 90.0% world population coverage for different ethnic groups. Molecular docking of the chimeric vaccine peptide with the immune receptors (TLR3 and TLR4) predicted efficient binding. Immune simulation predicted significant primary immune response with increased IgM and secondary immune response with high levels of both IgG1 and IgG2. It also increased the proliferation of T-helper cells and cytotoxic T-cells along with the increased INF-{gamma} and IL-2 cytokines. The codon optimization and mRNA secondary structure prediction revealed the chimera is suitable for high-level expression and cloning. Overall, the constructed recombinant chimeric vaccine candidate demonstrated significant potential and can be considered for clinical validation to fight against this global threat, COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is a novel highly virulent pathogen which gains entry to human cells by binding with the cell surface receptor - angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2). We computationally contrasted the binding interactions between human ACE2 and coronavirus spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) of the 2002 epidemic-causing SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and bat coronavirus RaTG13 using the Rosetta energy function. We find that the RBD of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is highly optimized to achieve very strong binding with human ACE2 (hACE2) which is consistent with its enhanced infectivity. SARS-CoV-2 forms the most stable complex with hACE2 compared to SARS-CoV-1 (23% less stable) or RaTG13 (11% less stable) while occupying the greatest number of residues in the ATR1 binding site. Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD out-competes the angiotensin 2 receptor type I (ATR1) which is the native binding partner of ACE2 by 35% in terms of the calculated binding affinity. Strong binding is mediated through strong electrostatic attachments with every fourth residue on the N-terminus alpha-helix (starting from Ser19 to Asn53) as the turn of the helix makes these residues solvent accessible. By contrasting the spike protein SARS-CoV-2 Rosetta binding energy with ACE2 of different livestock and pet species we find strongest binding with bat ACE2 followed by human, feline, equine, canine and finally chicken. This is consistent with the hypothesis that bats are the viral origin and reservoir species. These results offer a computational explanation for the increased infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and allude to therapeutic modalities by identifying and rank-ordering the ACE2 residues involved in binding with the virus.",

Current evidence suggests that corticostriatal circuits control the expression of established compulsions, but little is known about the mechanisms regulating the development of compulsions. We hypothesized that dopamine, a critical modulator of striatal synaptic plasticity, could control alterations in corticostriatal circuits leading to the development of compulsions (defined as continued reward-seeking in the face of punishment). We used dual-site fiber photometry to measure dopamine axon activity in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) as compulsions emerged. Individual variability in the speed with which compulsions emerged was predicted by DMS dopamine axon activity. Amplifying this dopamine signal accelerated animals transitions to compulsion, whereas inhibition led to learning delays. In contrast, amplifying DLS dopamine signaling had no effect on the emergence of compulsions. These results establish DMS dopamine signaling as a key controller of the development of compulsive reward-seeking.",

As the human microbiome contains thousands of species and strains of microbes, we sought to apply both informatic and experimental approaches to these organisms to identify novel transcribed structured RNAs. We combine an experimental approach, RNA-Seq, with an informatic approach, comparative genomics across the human microbiome project, to discover 1,085 candidate, conserved structured RNAs that are actively transcribed in human fecal microbiomes.

These methods generally compute the similarity between a patients phenotypes and a database of gene-phenotype to find the most phenotypically similar match. The main limitation in these methods is their reliance on knowledge about phenotypes associated with particular genes, which is not complete in humans as well as in many model organisms such as the mouse and fish. Information about functions of gene products and anatomical site of gene expression is available for more genes and can also be related to phenotypes through ontologies and machine learning models.\n\nResultsWe developed a novel graph-based machine learning method for biomedical ontologies which is able to exploit axioms in ontologies and other graph-structured data. Using our machine learning method, we embed genes based on their associated phenotypes, functions of the gene products, and anatomical location of gene expression. We then develop a machine learning model to predict gene-disease associations based on the associations between genes and multiple biomedical ontologies, and this model significantly improves over state of the art methods. Furthermore, we extend phenotype-based gene prioritization methods significantly to all genes which are associated with phenotypes, functions, or site of expression.\n\nAvailabilitySoftware and data are available at https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/DL2Vec.\n\nContactrobert.hoehndorf@kaust.edu.sa",

Manually analyzing more than 680,000 satellite image chips at 19,896 plot locations, we here show that forest canopy mortality in Europe has continuously increased since 1985 (+1.5 {+/-} 0.28 % yr-1), with the highest canopy mortality rate of the past 34 years observed in 2018 (1.14 {+/-} 0.16 %). Using simulations, we demonstrate that a continued increase in canopy mortality will strongly alter forest demography, with the median forest age falling below 30 years in more than 50% of Europes countries by 2050. These demographic changes can have substantial cascading effects on forest regeneration, biodiversity, and carbon storage. The current trend of increasing canopy mortality is thus challenging the future of Europes forests, and should be a key priority of forest policy and management.",

    "abstract": "The human auditory sensory area, which includes primary and non-primary auditory cortices, has been considered to locate in the supra-temporal lobe for more than a century. Recently, accumulating evidence shows that the posterior part of insula responses to sounds under non-task states with relevant short latencies. However, whether posterior insula (InsP) contribute to forming auditory sensation remains unclear. Here we addressed this issue by recording and stimulation directly on the supra-temporal and insular areas via intracranial electrodes from 53 epileptic patients. During passive listening to a non-speech sound, the high-{gamma} (60-140 Hz) active rate of InsP (68.8%) was approximate to the non-primary auditory areas (72.4% and 79.0%). Moreover, we could not distinguish InsP from supra-temporal subareas by either activation, latency, temporal pattern or lateral dominance of sound induce high-{gamma}. On the contrary, direct electrical stimulation evoked auditory sensations effectively on supra-temporal subareas (> 65%), while sparsely on InsP (9.49%). The results of cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) showed strong bidirectional connectivity within supra-temporal areas, but weak connectivity between supra-temporal areas and InsP. These findings suggest that even the InsP has similar basic auditory response properties to the primary or non-primary cortex, it may not directly participate in the formation of auditory perception.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThiabendazole (TBZ), is a benzimidazole fungicide and anthelminthic whose high persistence and toxicity pose a serious environmental threat. In our quest for environmental mitigation we previously isolated the first TBZ-degrading bacterial consortium and provided preliminary evidence for its composition and the degrading role of a Sphingomonas. Here, we employed a multi-omic approach combined with DNA-stable isotope probing (SIP) to determine the genetic make-up of the key consortium members, to disentangle nutritional and metabolic interdependencies, to identify the transformation pathway of TBZ and to understand the genetic network driving its transformation.\n\nResultsTime-series SIP in combination with amplicon sequencing analysis verified the key role of Sphingomonas in TBZ degradation by assimilating over 80% of the 13C-labelled phenyl moiety of TBZ. Non-target mass spectroscopy (MS) analysis showed the accumulation of thiazole-4-carboxamidine as a single dead-end transformation product and no phenyl-containing derivative, in line with the phenyl moiety assimilation in the SIP analysis. Time series metagenomic analysis of the consortium supplemented with TBZ or succinate led to the assembly of 18 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) with >80% completeness, six (Sphingomonas 3X21F,{gamma} -Proteobacterium 34A, Bradyrhizobiaceae 9B and Hydrogenophaga 19A, 13A, and 23F) being dominant. Meta-transcriptomic and -proteomic analysis suggested that Sphingomonas mobilize a carbazole dioxygenase (car) operon during the initial cleavage of TBZ to thiazole-4-carboxamidine and catechol, the latter is further transformed by enzymes encoded in a catechol ortho-cleavage (cat) operon; both operons being up-regulated during TBZ degradation. Computational docking analysis of the terminal oxygenase component of car, CarAa, showed high affinity to TBZ, comparable to carbazole, reinforcing its high potency for TBZ transformation. These results suggest no interactions between consortium members in TBZ transformation, performed solely by Sphingomonas. In contrast, gene expression network analysis revealed strong interactions between Sphingomonas MAG 3X12F and Hydrogenophaga MAG 23F, with Hydrogenophaga activating its cobalamin biosynthetic pathway and Sphingomonas its cobalamin salvage pathway along TBZ degradation.\n\nConclusionsOur findings suggest interactions between consortium members which align with the \"black queen hypothesis\": Sphingomonas detoxifies TBZ, releasing consortium members by a toxicant; in return for this, Hydrogenophaga 23F provides cobalamin to the auxotrophic Sphingomonas.",

    "abstract": "Sickness behaviours, like lethargy, can slow the spread of pathogens across a social network. We conducted a field experiment to investigate how sickness behaviour reduces individual connectedness in a high-resolution dynamic social network. We captured adult female vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) from a wild roost. To create  sick bats, we injected a random half of the bats (n=16) with the immune-challenging substance, lipopolysaccharide, and injected control bats with saline (n=15). Over the next three days, we used proximity sensors to continuously track their associations under natural conditions. The  sick bats showed a clear decrease in social connectedness (degree, strength, and eigenvector centrality). Bats in the control group encountered fewer  sick bats and also spent less time near them. These effects varied by time of day and declined over 48 hours. High-resolution proximity data allow researchers to define network connections based on how a pathogen spreads (e.g. the minimum contact time or distance for transmission). We therefore show how the estimate of the sickness effect changes as network ties are defined using varying distances and durations of association. Tracking the effects of sickness behaviour on high-resolution dynamic social networks can help create more sophisticated simulations of pathogen transmission through structured populations.",

    "abstract": "Host individuals are often coinfected with diverse parasite assemblages, resulting in complex interactions among parasites within hosts. Within hosts, priority effects occur when the infection sequence alters the outcome of interactions among parasites. Yet, the role of host immunity in this process remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that the host response to first infection could generate priority effects among parasites, altering the assembly of later arriving strains during epidemics. We tested this by infecting sentinel host genotypes of Plantago lanceolata with strains of the fungal parasite, Podosphaera plantaginis, and measuring susceptibility to subsequent infection during experimental and natural epidemics. In these experiments, prior infection by one strain often increased susceptibility to other strains, and these facilitative priority effects altered the structure of parasite assemblages, but this effect depended on host genotype, host population, and parasite genotype. Thus, host genotype, spatial structure, and priority effects among strains all independently altered parasite assembly. Then, using a fine-scale survey and sampling of infections on wild hosts in several populations, we identified a signal of facilitative priority effects, which altered parasite assembly during natural epidemics. Together, these results provide evidence that within host priority effects by early arriving strains can drive parasite assembly, with implications for how strain diversity is spatially and temporally distributed during epidemics.",

    "abstract": "Following pathogenic challenge, activated B cells rapidly expand and undergo somatic hypermutation, yielding groups of clonally related B-cells with diversified immunoglobulin receptors. Inference of clonal relationships based on the receptor sequence is an essential step in many adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing studies. These relationships are typically identified by a multi-step process that involves: (1) grouping sequences based on shared V and J gene assignments, and junction lengths, and (2) clustering these sequences using a junction-based distance. However, this approach is sensitive to the initial V(D)J gene assignments, which are error-prone, and fails to identify clonal relatives whose junction length has changed through accumulation of indels. Through defining a translation-invariant feature space in which we cluster the sequences, we develop an alignment-free clonal identification method that does not require gene assignments and is not restricted to a fixed junction length. This alignment-free approach has higher sensitivity compared to a typical junction-based distance method without loss of specificity and PPV. While the alignment-free procedure identifies clones that are broadly consistent with the junction-based distance method, it also identifies clones with characteristics (multiple V or J gene assignments or junction lengths) that are not detectable with the junction based distance method.",

    "abstract": "Primary motor cortex (M1) almost exclusively controls the contralateral side of the body. However, M1 activity is also modulated during ipsilateral body movements. Previous work has shown that M1 activity related to the ipsilateral arm is independent of the M1 activity related to the contralateral arm. How do these patterns of activity interact when both arms move simultaneously? We explored this problem by training two monkeys (male, Macaca mulatta) in a postural perturbation task while recording from M1. Loads were applied to one arm at a time (unimanual) or both arms simultaneously (bimanual). We found 83% of neurons were responsive to both the unimanual and bimanual loads. We also observed a small reduction in activity magnitude during the bimanual loads for both limbs (25%). Across the unimanual and bimanual loads, neurons largely maintained their preferred load directions. However, there was a larger change in the preferred loads for the ipsilateral limb (~25%) than the contralateral limb (~9%). Lastly, we identified the contralateral and ipsilateral subspaces during the unimanual loads and found they captured a significant amount of the variance during the bimanual loads. However, the subspace captured more of the bimanual variance related to the contralateral limb (97%) than the ipsilateral limb (66%). Our results highlight that even during bimanual motor actions, M1 largely retains its representations of the contralateral and ipsilateral limbs.\n\nSignificance StatementPrevious work has shown that primary motor cortex (M1) reflects information related to the contralateral limb, its downstream target, but also reflects information related to the ipsilateral limb. Can M1 still reflect both sources of information when performing simultaneous movements of the limbs? Here we use a postural perturbation task to show that M1 activity maintains a similar representation for the contralateral limb during bimanual motor actions, while there is only a modest change in the representation of the ipsilateral limb. Our results indicate that two orthogonal representations can be maintained and expressed simultaneously in M1.",

    "abstract": "Small-cell lung cancers derive from pulmonary neuroendocrine cells, which have stemlike properties to reprogram into other cell types upon lung injury. It is difficult to uncouple transcriptional plasticity of these transformed cells from genetic changes that evolve in primary tumors or secondary metastases. Profiling of single cells also problematic if the required sample dissociation activates injury-like signaling and reprogramming. Here, we defined cell-state heterogeneities in situ through laser capture microdissection-based 10-cell transcriptomics coupled with stochastic-profiling fluctuation analysis. Using labeled cells from a small-cell lung cancer mouse model initiated by neuroendocrine deletion of Rb1-Trp53, we profiled variations in transcript abundance to identify cell-to-cell differences in regulatory state in vitro and in vivo. Fluctuating transcripts in spheroid culture were partly shared among Rb1-Trp53-null models, and heterogeneities increased considerably when cells were delivered intravenously to colonize the liver. Colonization of immunocompromised animals drove fractional appearance of alveolar type II-like markers and poised cells for paracrine stimulation from immune cells and hepatocytes. Immunocompetency further exaggerated the fragmentation of tumor states in the liver, yielding mixed stromal signatures evident in bulk sequencing from autochthonous tumors and metastases. Dozens of transcript heterogeneities recur irrespective of biological context; their mapped orthologs brought together observations of murine and human small-cell lung cancer. Candidate heterogeneities recurrent in the liver also stratified primary human tumors into discrete groups not readily explained by molecular subtype but with prognostic relevance. We conclude that heterotypic interactions in the liver and lung are an accelerant for intratumor heterogeneity in small-cell lung cancer.\n\nStatement of significanceThe single-cell regulatory heterogeneity of small-cell lung cancer becomes increasingly elaborate in the liver, a common metastatic site for the disease.",

    "abstract": "Cancer evolves from premalignant clones that accumulate mutations and adopt unusual cell states to achieve transformation. Previously, we pinpointed the oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) as a cell-of-origin for glioma, but the early changes of mutant OPCs during premalignancy remained unknown. Using mice engineered for inducible Nf1-Trp53 loss in OPCs, we acutely isolated labeled mutant OPCs by laser-capture microdissection and determined gene-expression changes by bulk RNA sequencing and a fluctuation analysis, called stochastic profiling, which uses RNA-sequencing measurements from random pools of 10 mutant cells. At 12 days after Nf1-Trp53 deletion, while bulk differences were mostly limited to mitotic hallmarks and genes for ribosome biosynthesis, stochastic profiling revealed a spectrum of stem-progenitor (Axl, Aldh1a1), proneural, and mesenchymal states as potential starting points for gliomagenesis. At 90 days, bulk sequencing detected very few differentially expressed transcripts, whereas stochastic profiling revealed cell states for neurons and mural cells that do not give rise to glial tumors, suggesting cellular dead-ends for gliomagenesis. Importantly, we identified mutant OPCs that strongly expressed key effectors of nonsense-mediated decay (Upf3b) and homology-dependent DNA repair (Rad51c, Slx1b, Ercc4) along with DNA-damage markers suggesting transcription-associated replication stress. Analysis of 10-cell transcriptomes at 90 days identified a locus of elevated gene expression containing an additional repair endonuclease (Mus81) and Rin1, a Ras-Raf antagonist and possible counterbalance to Nf1 loss. At 150 days, Rin1 was microdeleted in some gliomas and downregulated in all others. Replication stress may pose a considerable bottleneck that must be resolved for gliomas to initiate.\n\nStatement of significanceIn situ stochastic profiling of heterogeneous cell states in a mouse model of glioma uncovers regulatory confusion in a glioma cell-of-origin and defines a state of replication stress that precedes tumor initiation.",

    "abstract": "Yarrowia lipolytica offers an ideal host for biosynthesis of high value natural products and oleochemicals through metabolic engineering despite being restricted to a limited number of selective markers, and counter-selection achieved primarily with URA3. In this work, we investigate MET25, a locus of sulfide housekeeping within the cell, to be exploited as a standard genetic marker. Divalent lead supplemented in media induces lead sulfide (PbS) aggregation in MET25-deficient cells such that deficient cells grow brown/black, and cells with functional copies of MET25 grow white. Loss of MET25 did not induce strict auxotrophic requirements for methionine in Y. lipolytica, indicating MET25 deficiency could be rescued by alternative pathways. Plasmid and chromosomal-based complementation of MET25 deficient cells on a double layer agar plate with nutrient gradients demonstrates delayed phenotype (white morphology) restoration, indicating post-transcriptional feedback regulation of methionine biosynthesis in this yeast. MET25 deficient Y. lipolytica could be used as an efficient whole-cell lead sensor with detection limit as low as 10 ppm of lead in drinking water. We further tested whether MET25 deficiency can be exploited to confer resistance to methyl-mercury through chemical neutralization and detoxification. Kinetic growth curves of wild type and MET25-deficient cells were obtained under varying concentrations of methylmercury and cellular toxicity to methyl mercury was calculated from the Hill equation. Our results indicate that methylmecury may not be used as the counter-selectable marker due to insignificant changes of growth fitness. This work demonstrates the utility of using MET25 as a sensitive lead sensor and the challenges of using MET25 as a counter-selectable genetic marker, as well as the complex regulation of methionine biosynthesis in Y. lipolyitca, which may shed lights for us to develop valuable biotechnological applications centering around the sulfur house-keeping metabolism of the nonconventional yeast.",

    "abstract": "Volume electron microscopy enables the ultrastructural analysis of biological tissues and is essential for dense reconstructions e.g. of neuronal circuits. So far, three-dimensional analysis is based on either serial sectioning followed by sequential imaging (ATUM, ssTEM/SEM) or serial block-face imaging (SB-SEM, FIB-SEM), where imaging is intercalated with sectioning. Currently, the techniques involving ultramicrotomy allow scanning large fields of view, but afford only limited z-resolution determined by section thickness, while ion beam-milling approaches yield isotropic voxels, but are restricted in volume size. Now we present a hybrid method, named ATUM-FIB, which combines the advantages of both approaches: ATUM-FIB is based on serial sectioning of tissue into semithick (2-10 {micro}m) resin sections that are collected onto transparent tape. 3D information obtained by serial light and electron microscopy allows identifying regions of interest that are then directly accessible for targeted FIB-SEM. The set of serial semithin sections thus represent a tissue  library, which provides information about microscopic tissue context that can then be probed  on demand by local high resolution analysis. We demonstrate the potential of this technique to reveal the ultrastructure of rare but pathologically important events by identifying microglia contact sites with amyloid plaques in a mouse model for familial Alzheimers disease.",

    "abstract": "Over the last two decades the United States has experienced a significant increase in the medical and non-medical use of opioid drugs, resulting in record numbers of opioid-related overdoses and deaths. There was an initial increase in non-medical use of prescription opioids around 2002, followed later by increased heroin use and then most recently fentanyl. Inhalation is a common route of administration for opioids, with a documented history spanning back to Mediterranean antiquity and up through modern use with e-cigarette devices. Unfortunately, preclinical studies using inhalation as the route of administration remain relatively few. This study was conducted to determine the efficacy of e-cigarette vapor inhalation of heroin in rats. Non-contingent exposure to heroin or methadone vapor produced anti-nociceptive efficacy in male and female rats. Female rats were trained to self-administer heroin vapor; the most-preferring half of the distribution obtained more vapor reinforcers when the concentration of heroin was reduced in the vapor vehicle and when pre-treated with the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone. The anti-nociceptive effect of heroin self-administered by vapor was identical in magnitude to that produced by intravenous self-administration. Finally, anxiety-like behavior increased 24-48 hours after last heroin vapor access, consistent with withdrawal signs observed after intravenous self-administration. In sum, these studies show that rewarding and anti-nociceptive effects of heroin are produced in rats by vapor inhalation using e-cigarette technology. Importantly, self-administration models by this route can be deployed to determine health effects of inhaled heroin or other opioids.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between glycans and glycan-binding proteins (GBPs) mediate diverse cellular functions, and therefore are of diagnostic and therapeutic significance. Current leading strategies for studying glycan-GBP interactions require specialized knowledge and instrumentation. In this study, we report a strategy for studying glycan-GBP interactions that uses PCR, qPCR and next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies that are more routinely accessible. Our headpiece conjugation-code ligation (HCCL) strategy couples glycans with unique DNA codes that specify glycan sugar moieties and glycosidic linkages when sequenced. We demonstrate the technology by synthesizing a DNA encoded glycan library of 50 biologically relevant glycans (DEGL-50) and probing interactions against 25 target proteins including lectins and antibodies. Data show glycan-GPB interactions in solution that are consistent with lower content, lower throughput ELISA assays. Data further demonstrate how monovalent and multivalent headpieces can be used to increase glycan-GPB interactions and enrich signals while using smaller sample sizes. The flexibility of our modular HCCL strategy has potential for producing large glycan libraries, facilitating high content-high throughput glycan binding studies, and increasing access to lower cost glyco-analyses.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=60 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/017012v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (17K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fb1c1dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f2c3ceorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11546e7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e21a83_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Patients with Crohns disease exhibit abnormal colonization of the intestine by proteobacteria, and among these bacteria, the adherent invasive E. coli (AIEC) family. They are predominant in the mucus, adhere to epithelial cells, colonize them and survive inside macrophages. We recently demonstrated that the acclimation of the AIEC strain LF82 to phagolysosomal stress requires stringent and SOS responses. Such adaptation involves a long lag phase in which many LF82 cells become antibiotic tolerant. Later during infection, they proliferate in vacuoles and form colonies harboring dozens of LF82 bacteria. In the present work, we investigated the mechanism sustaining this phase of growth. We found that intracellular LF82 produced an extrabacterial matrix composed of exopolysaccharides and amyloid fibers that surrounded each individual LF82 cell. This matrix acts as a biofilm and controls the formation of LF82 intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) inside phagolysosomes for several days post infection. Using genomics assays, we characterized the gene set involved in IBCs formation and revealed the crucial role played by a pathogenicity island presents in the genome of most AIEC strains in this process. Iron capture, by the yersiniabactin system encoded by this pathogenicity island, is essential to form IBC and LF82 survival within macrophages. These results demonstrate that AIEC have developed a sophisticated strategy to establish their replicative niche within macrophages, which might have implications for envisioning future antibacterial strategies for Crohns disease.",

While recent technological advances have facilitated the analysis of the ultrastructure of these channels, there are limitations to efficiently addressing their presence over an entire cellular interface. Here, we highlight the value of serial block electron microscopy for this purpose. We developed a computational pipeline to study plasmodesmata distributions and we detect presence/absence of plasmodesmata clusters, pit fields, at the phloem unloading interfaces of Arabidopsis thaliana roots. Pit fields can be visualised and quantified. As the wall environment of plasmodesmata is highly specialised we also designed a tool to extract the thickness of the extracellular matrix at and outside plasmodesmata positions. We show and quantify clear wall thinning around plasmodesmata with differences between genotypes, namely in the recently published plm-2 sphingolipid mutant. Our tools open new avenues for quantitative approaches in the analysis of symplastic trafficking.\n\nSentence summaryWe developed computational tools for serial block electron microscopy datasets to extract information on the spatial distribution of plasmodesmata over an entire cellular interface and on the wall environment the plasmodesmata are in.",

    "abstract": "There is a growing body of evidence that the common ancestor of vertebrates had a bimodal karyotype, i.e. consisting of large macrochromosomes and small microchromosomes. This type of karyotype organization is preserved in most reptiles. However, certain species independently experience microchromosome fusions. The evolutionary forces behind this are unclear. We investigated the karyotype of the green spiny lizard, Sceloporus malachiticus, an iguana species which has 2n=22, whereas the ancestral karyotype of iguanas had 2n=36. We obtained and sequenced flow-sorted chromosome-specific DNA samples and found that most of the microchromosome fusions in this species involved sex chromosomes. We found that certain ancestral squamate chromosomes, such as the homologue of the Anolis carolinensis chromosome 11, are repeatedly involved in sex chromosome formation in different species. To test the hypothesis that the karyotypic shift could be associated with changes in recombination patterns, and to study sex chromosome synapsis and recombination in meiosis, we performed synaptonemal complex analysis in this species and in S. variabilis, a related species with 2n=34. We found that in the species studied the recombination patterns correlate more with phylogeny than with the structure of the karyotype. The sex chromosomes had two distal pseudoautosomal regions and a medial differentiated region.",

    "abstract": "Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a chronic, occlusive cerebrovascular disease that predominantly affects East Asian populations. The major genetic mutation associated with MMD in Asian populations is the p.R4810K substitution in Ring Finger Protein 213 (RNF213). Interestingly, variants in the RNF213 gene have also been implicated in intracranial aneurysms (IA) in French-Canadian population, suggesting that variation in this gene may play a broader role in cerebrovascular phenotypes. In a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a Caucasian population, variants rs6565653 and rs12601526 in the Solute Carrier Family 26 Member 11 (SLC26A11) gene, which is less than 10kb away from RNF213, showed a suggestive association with young onset ischemic stroke. We propose that the signal could be tagging an association with common variation in the RNF213 gene. We analyzed the linkage disequilibrium (LD) pattern in the SLC26A11-RNF213 gene region and we observed a high LD between variants in this region based on D values. We show that SLC26A11 rs6565653 variant tags RNF213 rs12944088, a missense variant that is more common among subjects with IA than in healthy individuals. Given the fact that rs6565653 tags several RNF213 variants, it is highly likely that some of these tagged variants modify the risk of suffering stroke. The LD analyses suggest that the SLC26A11 signal from the young onset ischemic stroke GWAS performed in a Caucasian population is also tagging variation at the RNF213 loci, supporting the hypothesis that RNF213 variation may result in a variety of neurovascular disorders including an increased risk and/or worse prognosis following ischemic stroke in Caucasian population.",

IFN pathways contribute to resistance to conventional chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy and are often deregulated in cancer. USP18 is the predominant human protease that cleaves interferon-stimulated gene ISG15, a ubiquitin-like protein tightly regulated in the context of innate immunity, from its modified substrate proteins in vivo. In this study, using advanced proteomic techniques, we have expanded the USP18-dependent ISGylome and proteome in a chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML)-derived cell line (HAP1) treated with type I IFN. Novel ISGylation targets were characterised that modulate the sensing of innate ligands, antigen presentation and secretion of cytokines. Consequently, CML USP18-deficient cells are more antigenic, driving increased activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and are more susceptible to irradiation.

    "abstract": "Maternal immune activation (MIA) during pregnancy increases the odds of developing neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) later in life. In pregnant mice, MIA can be induced by injecting the viral mimic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C) to pregnant dams resulting in altered fetal neurodevelopmental and behavioral changes in their progeny. Although the murine MIA model has been extensively studied worldwide, the underlying mechanisms have only been partially elucidated. Furthermore, the murine MIA model suffers from lack of reproducibility, at least in part because it is highly influenced by subtle changes in environmental conditions. In human studies, multivariable (MV) statistical analysis is widely used to control for covariates including sex, age, exposure to environmental factors and many others. We reasoned that animal studies in general, and studies on the MIA model in particular, could therefore benefit from MV analyzes to account for complex phenotype interactions and high inter-individual variability. Here, we used a dataset consisting of 26 variables collected on 67 male pups during the course of several independent experiments on the MIA model. We then analyzed this dataset using penalized regression to identify variables associated with in utero exposure to MIA. In addition to confirming the association between some previously described biological variables and MIA, we identified new variables that could play a role in neurodevelopment alterations. Aside from providing new insights into variable interactions in the MIA model, this study highlights the importance of extending the use of MV statistics to animal studies.",

    "abstract": "Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS), a special type of ultrasonic stimulation, is attracting a lot of attention for both clinical and scientific research. In this paper, we report a concept of a new method using magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) for LIPUS-assisted gene delivery. The MNPs are iron oxide superparamagnetic nanoparticles, coated with polyethyleneimine (PEI), which introduces a high positive surface charge, favorable for the binding of genetic material. Due to the paramagnetic properties of the MNPs, the application of an external magnetic field increases transfection efficiency; meanwhile, LIPUS stimulation enhances cell permeability. We found out that stimulation at the intensity of 30 mW/cm2 for 10 minutes yields optimal results with a minimal adverse effect on the cells. Combining the effect of the external magnetic field and LIPUS, the genetic material (GFP or Cherry Red plasmid in our case) can enter the cells. The flow cytometry results showed that by using just a magnetic field to direct the genetic material, the transfection efficiency of HEK 293 cells that were treated with our MNPs was 56.1%. Coupled with LIPUS stimulation, it increased to 61.5% or 19% higher than the positive control (Lipofectamine 2000). In addition, compared with the positive control, our method showed less toxicity. Cell viability after transfection was 63.61%, 19% higher than with the standard transfection technique. In conclusion, we designed a new gene-delivery technique that is affordable, targeted, shows low-toxicity, yet high transfection efficiency, compared to other conventional approaches.\n\nThe Graphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=127 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/018440v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (33K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@72028corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1057528org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14ea607org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@764da1_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMosquito is a human health tread nowadays, the major health problems caused by them are malaria, dengue fever, yellow fever, zika as well as several other outbreaks. The major problem in controlling dengue vectors are the resistant problems. Different classes of insecticides used for public have raised the concern of resistant problem with mosquitoes and environmental pollution. Thus, alternative chemical compounds search is necessary to be searched for overcoming the resistance problem of using pesticides in vectors and the chemical free environment respectively. Thus, to solve these problems, purpose of this study is to identify the larvicidal mechanism, metabolite, antioxidant, chemical compounds and its structure from C. ternatea flower and to test its efficacies against early 4th instar larvae of Ae. aegypti and Ae albopictus.\n\nMethodsClitoria ternatea flowers were collected from the Garden of the Faculty of Medicine in International Quest University, Ipoh, Perak and used for crude extraction. Then, the metabolite test, antioxidant test, chromatography techniques were conducted to identify chemical composition of extracts and their chemical structures were identified using GCMS-QP2010 Ultra (Shimadzu). Next, following WHO procedures for larval bioassays, the extracts were used to evaluate against early 4th instar larvae of Aedes mosquito vectors.\n\nResultsThe larvicidal activity of Clitoria ternatea flowers extracts evidently affected the early 4th instar larvae of Aedes mosquito vectors. The highest larvicidal activity was observed against early 4th instar larvae of Ae. aegypti with the LC50 and LC95 values of 1056 and 2491 mg/L, respectively. Meanwhile larvae bioassay test for Ae.albopictus recorded with the LC50 and LC95 values of 1425 and 2753 mg/L. Moreover, the results for non target organism test on Guppy fish, Poecilia reticulate showed no mortalities with flower extracts at 2500 mg/L and posses no toxic effects on fish. In this study, total of 16 chemical compounds and 6 chemical compounds have been reported to posses direct effects on insecticidal, larvicidal and pupicidal effects. Namely 6 chemicals used for insecticidal properties were Glycerin, 2-Hydroxy-gamma-butyrolactone, Neophytadiene, n-Hexadecanoic acid, cis-Vaccenic acid, and Octadecanoic acid with total of 28.7%. Clitoria ternatea flower extracts also showed different types of phenols such as anthocyanin, flavonoid and tannin.\n\nConclusionsOur findings showed that crude extract of Clitoria ternatea flower bioactive molecules to be effective and may be developed as biolarvicides for Aedes mosquito vector control. Furthermore, this study also provided a baseline understanding for future research work on the field applications of Clitoria ternatea flower extracts which could be tested for its long term effects on other non target organisms, including human health.",

    "abstract": "Keratin intermediate filaments are the principal structural element of epithelial cells. Their importance in providing bulk cellular stiffness is well recognized, but their role in the mechanics of cell cortex is less understood. In this study, we therefore compared the cortical stiffness of three keratinocyte lines: primary wild type cells (NHEK2), immortalized wild type cells (NEB1) and immortalized mutant cells (KEB7). The cortical stiffness was measured by lateral indentation of cells with AOD-steered optical tweezers without employing any moving mechanical elements. The method was validated on fixed cells and Cytochalasin-D treated cells to ensure that the observed variations in stiffness within a single cell line were not a consequence of low measurement precision. The measurements of the cortical stiffness showed that primary wild type cells were significantly stiffer than immortalized wild type cells, which was also detected in previous studies of bulk elasticity. In addition, a small difference between the mutant and the wild type cells was detected, showing that mutation of keratin impacts also the cell cortex. Thus, our results indicate that the role of keratins in cortical stiffness is not negligible and call for further investigation of the mechanical interactions between keratins and elements of the cell cortex.",

    "abstract": "The rate at which plants grow is a major functional trait in plant ecology. However, little is known about its evolution in natural populations. Here, we investigate evolutionary and environmental factors shaping variation in the growth rate of Arabidopsis thaliana. We used plant diameter as a proxy to monitor plant growth over time in environments that mimicked latitudinal differences in the intensity of natural light radiation, across a set of 278 genotypes sampled within four broad regions, including an outgroup set of genotypes from China. A field experiment conducted under natural conditions confirmed the ecological relevance of the observed variation. All genotypes markedly expanded their rosette diameter when the light supply was decreased, demonstrating that environmental plasticity is a predominant source of variation to adapt plant size to prevailing light conditions. Yet, we detected significant levels of genetic variation both in growth rate and growth plasticity. Genome-wide association studies revealed that only 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms associate with genetic variation for growth above Bonferroni confidence levels. However, marginally associated variants were significantly enriched among genes with an annotated role in growth and stress reactions. Polygenic scores computed from marginally associated variants confirmed the polygenic basis of growth variation. For both light regimes, phenotypic divergence between the most distantly related population (China) and the various regions in Europe is smaller than the variation observed within Europe, indicating that some level of stabilizing selection constrains the evolution of growth rate. We observed that Spanish genotypes, however, reach a significantly larger size than Northern European genotypes. Tests of adaptive divergence and analysis of the individual burden of deleterious mutations reveal that adaptive processes have played a more important role in shaping regional differences in rosette growth than maladaptive evolution.",

    "abstract": "Pyrazinamide (PZA) is one of the most important drugs used in combined antituberculous therapy. After the drug enters Mycobacterium tuberculosis it is hydrolyzed by pyrazinamidase (PZAse) to the bactericidal molecule pyrazinoic acid (POA). Ribosomal protein S1 (RpsA) was recently identified as a possible target of PZA based on its binding activity to POA and capacity to inhibit trans-translation. However, its role is not completely understood.\n\nIt has been proposed that Mycobacterium smegmatis RpsA is not capable of binding POA, unlike M. tuberculosis RpsA. This may be due to the different amino acid sequence in the carboxy-terminal region of the two molecules: in M. smegmatis RpsA it is much closer to the sites that may interact with POA than in M. tuberculosis RpsA. These differences could be contributing, along with the presence of highly active POA efflux, to the natural resistance to PZA in M. smegmatis.\n\nTo further understand the mechanisms of action of PZA and the role of RpsA in PZA susceptibility, we evaluated the effect of complementing M. tuberculosis RpsA expression in M. smegmatis using pNIT mycobacterial non-integrative expression vector and then performed a PZA susceptibility test determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of PZA. It was expected that chimeric ribosomes comprising M. tuberculosis RpsA may be present and may affect PZA susceptibility.\n\nOur results showed a reduction in PZA MIC in M. smegmatis complemented with overexpressed M. tuberculosis RpsA compared to non-overexpressed M. smegmatis (468 {micro}g/mL and >7500 {micro}g/mL respectively).",

    "abstract": "The envelope glycoprotein (Env) of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), has been the primary target for the development of a protective vaccine against infection. The extensive N-linked glycosylation on Env is an important consideration as it may affect efficacy, stability, and expression yields. The expression host has been shown to influence the extent and type of glycosylation that decorates the protein target. Here, we report the glycosylation profile of the candidate subtype C immunogen CO6980v0c22 gp145 produced in two different host cells: CHO-K1 and Expi293F. The amino acid sequence for both glycoproteins was confirmed to be identical by peptide mass fingerprinting. However, the isoelectric point of the proteins differed; 4.5-5.5 and 6.0-7.0 for gp145 produced in CHO-K1 and Expi293F, respectively. These differences in pI were eliminated by enzymatic treatment with sialidase, indicating a large difference in the incorporation of sialic acid between hosts. This dramatic difference in the number of sialylated glycans between hosts was confirmed by analysis of PNGase F-released glycans using MALDI-ToF MS. These differences in glycosylation, however, did not greatly translate into differences in antibody recognition. Biosensor assays showed that gp145 produced in CHO-K1 had similar affinity toward the broadly neutralizing antibodies, 2G12 and PG16, as the gp145 produced in Expi293F. Additionally, both immunogens showed the same reactivity against plasma of HIV-infected patients. Taken together, these results support the notion that there are sizeable differences in the glycosylation of Env depending on the expression host. How these differences translate to vaccine efficacy remains unknown.",

    "abstract": "In angiosperm self-incompatibility systems, pollen with an allele matching the pollen recipient at the self-incompatibility locus is rejected. Extreme allelic polymorphism is maintained by frequency-dependent selection favoring rare alleles. However, two challenges limit the spread of a new allele (a tightly linked haplotype in this case) under the widespread \"collaborative non-self recognition\" mechanism. First, there is no obvious selective benefit for pollen compatible with non-existent stylar incompatibilities, which themselves cannot spread if no pollen can fertilize them. However, a pistil-function mutation complementary to a previously neutral pollen mutation may spread if it restores self-incompatibility to a self-compatible intermediate. Second, we show that novel haplotypes can drive elimination of existing ones with fewer siring opportunities. We calculate relative probabilities of increase and collapse in haplotype number given the initial collection of incompatibility haplotypes and the population gene conversion rate. Expansion in haplotype number is possible when population gene conversion rate is large, but large contractions are likely otherwise. A Markov chain model derived from these expansion and collapse probabilities generates a stable haplotype number distribution in the realistic range of 10-40 under plausible parameters. However, smaller populations might lose many haplotypes beyond those lost by chance during bottlenecks.",

    "abstract": "1During the last decade, pain scales including facial expressions as indicators of pain have been developed for horses, mostly relying on direct observations or inspection of images. Despite differences in the research conditions and methodology the different scales focus on the same regions of the face, corresponding to moveable facial muscles related to the ears, eyes, nostrils, lips and chin. However, a detailed comparison of the facial activities occurring during pain is not possible. We used a Facial Action Coding System modified for horses to code and analyse video recordings from an earlier study of acute short-term experimental pain and from clinical cases with and without pain. We demonstrated for the first time EquiFACS based changes to pain in video of horses, using traditional statistical methods based on frequency, and novel analyses based on sliding observation windows and co-occurrence of facial actions. The most prominent differences of the experimental horses were related to the lower face actions chin raiser and nostril dilator, while less prominent, but significantly more frequent actions were related to the eye region, inner brow raiser (AU101), increased eye white (AD1), half blink (AU47), and ear rotator (EAD104). Ears forward (EAD101) and eye blink (AU145) were not associated to pain. Based on this we selected the two lower face actions for analysis of the clinical videos, and found that their co-occurrence within a window of 10 to 15 second gave 100% positive predictive values, as compared to the rating from three expert pain raters. Using our developed co-occurrence analyses we were surprised to detect that the chance of identifying three or more of the facial actions related to pain in 0.04 second sequence, corresponding to one frame, was below 3%, indicating that use of randomly selected images for pain scoring may be a very insensitive method.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cachexia is a debilitating condition characterized by an extreme loss of skeletal muscle mass which negatively impacts patients quality of life, reduces their ability to sustain anticancer therapies, and increases the risk of mortality. Recent discoveries have identified the myostatin/activin-ActRIIB pathway as critical to muscle wasting by inducing satellite cell quiescence and increasing muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases responsible for atrophy. Remarkably, pharmacological blockade of the ActRIIB pathway has shown to reverse muscle wasting and prolong the survival time of tumor-bearing animals. To explore the implications of this signaling pathway and potential therapeutic targets in cachexia, we construct a novel mathematical model of muscle tissue subjected to tumor-derived cachexic factors. The model formulation tracks the intercellular interactions between cancer, satellite cell, and muscle cell populations. The model is parameterized by fitting to colon-26 mouse model data, and analysis provides insight into tissue growth in healthy, cancerous, and post-treatment conditions. Model predictions suggest that cachexia fundamentally alters muscle tissue health, as measured by the stem cell ratio, and this is only partially recovered by anti-cachexia treatment. Our mathematical findings suggest that the activation and proliferation of satellite cells, after blocking the myostatin/activin B pathway, is required to partially recover cancer-induced muscle loss.",

    "abstract": "Aquatic macroinvertebrates play a crucial role in freshwater ecosystems, but their diversity remains poorly known, particularly in the tropics. This \"taxonomic void\" represents limits our understanding of biodiversity patterns and processes in freshwater ecosystems, and the scale at which they operate. We used DNA barcoding to estimate lineage diversity (and the diversity of unique haplotypes) in 224 specimens of freshwater macroinvertebrates at a small spatial scale within the Panama Canal Watershed (PCW). In addition, we compiled available barcoding data to assess macroinvertebrate diversity at a broader spatial scale spanning the Isthmus of Panama. Consistently across two species delimitation algorithms (i.e., ABGD and GMYC), we found high lineage diversity within the PCW, with ~ 100-106 molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs at 2% sequence divergence) across 168 unique haplotypes. We also found a high lineage diversity along the Isthmus of Panama, but this diversity peaked within the PCW. However, our rarefaction/extrapolation approach showed that this diversity remains under sampled. As expected, these results indicate that the diversity of Neotropical freshwater macroinvertebrates is higher than previously thought, with the possibility of high endemicity even at narrow spatial scales. Geographic isolation is likely a main factor shaping these patterns of diversity. However, local disturbances such as the rupture of the continental divide due to the construction of the Panama Canal might be reshaping these patterns of diversity at a local scale. Although further work is needed to better understand the processes driving diversification in freshwater macroinvertebrates, we suggest that Neotropical streams represent continental islands of diversity. Understanding these islands of diversity is crucial in the face of increasing human disturbance.",

In recent years a clear trend to more individual reproduction can be observed as the ability to measure individual head-related-transfer-functions (HRTFs) is becoming more widespread. The question of the accuracy and reproduction methods needed for a realistic playback however has not been sufficiently answered. To evaluate an appropriate approach for binaural reproduction via headphones different head-related-transfer-functions (HRTFs) and reproduction methods were compared in this paper. In a listening test eleven explicitly trained participants were asked to localize eleven sound sources positioned in the right hemisphere using the proximal pointing method. Binaural stimuli based on individually measured HRTFs were compared to those of an artificial head in a static reproduction of stimuli and in three dynamic reproduction methods of different resolutions (5{degrees}, 2.5{degrees} and 1{degrees}). Unsigned errors in azimuth and elevation as well as front-back-confusions and in-head-localization were observed. Dynamic reproduction of any resolution applied turned out fundamental for a reduction of undesired front-back-confusions and in-head-localization. Individually measured HRTFs showed a smaller effect on localization accuracy compared to the influence of dynamic sound reproduction. They were mainly observed to reduce the front-back-confusion rate.",

    "abstract": "During the Middle Paleolithic period, bone marrow extraction was an essential source of fat nutrients for hunter-gatherers especially throughout cold and dry seasons. This is attested by the recurrent findings of percussion marks in osteological material from anthropized archaeological levels. Among them some showed indicators that the marrow extraction process was part of a butchery cultural practice, meaning that the inflicted fracturing gestures and techniques were recurrent, standardized and counter-intuitive i.e. culturally influenced. In order to assess the weight of the counter-intuitive factor in the percussion mark pattern distribution, we carried out an experiment that by contrast focuses on the intuitive approach of fracturing bones to extract marrow, involving individual without experience in this activity.\n\nWe wanted to evaluate the influence of bone morphology and the individuals behaviour on the distribution of percussion marks. Twelve experimenters broke 120 limb bones, a series of 10 bones per individual. During the experiment, information concerning the fracture of the bones as well as individual behaviour was collected and was subsequently compared to data from the laboratory study of the remains. Then, we applied an innovative GIS (Geographic Information System) method to analyze the distribution of percussion marks to highlight recurrent patterns. Results show that in spite of all the variables there is a high similarity in the distribution of percussion marks which we consider as intuitive patterns. The factor influenced the distribution for the humerus, radius-ulna and tibia series is the bone morphology, while for the femur series individual behaviour seems to have more weight in the distribution. To go further in the subject we need to compare the intuitive models with the distributions of percussion marks registered in fossil assemblages. Thus, it would be possible to propose new hypotheses on butchering practices based on the results presented in this work.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn the field of cell therapy for heart disease, a new paradigm of repeated dosing of cells has recently emerged. However, the lack of a repeatable cell delivery method in preclinical studies in rodents is a major obstacle to investigating this paradigm.\n\nMethods and ResultsWe have established and standardized a method of echocardiography-guided percutaneous left ventricular intracavitary injection (echo-guided LV injection) as a cell delivery approach in infarcted mice. Here, we describe the method in detail and address several important issues regarding it. First, by integrating anatomical and echocardiographic considerations, we have established strategies to determine a safe anatomical window for injection in infarcted mice. Second, we summarize our experience with this method (734 injections). The overall survival rate was 91.4%. Previous studies results suggest that 1x106 cells delivered via this method yielded similar retention in the heart at 24 h as 1x105 cells delivered via intracoronary or intramyocardial injection. Lastly, we examined the efficacy of this cell delivery approach. Compared with vehicle treatment, cardiac mesenchymal cells (CMCs) delivered via this method improved cardiac function assessed both echocardiographically and hemodynamically. Furthermore, repeated injections of CMCs via this method yielded greater cardiac function improvement than single dose administration.\n\nConclusionEcho-guided LV injection is a feasible, reproducible, relatively less invasive and effective delivery method for cell therapy in heart disease. It is an important approach that could move the field of cell therapy forward, especially with regard to repeated cell administrations.",

    "abstract": "Eudiplozoon nipponicum (Goto, 1891) is a hematophagous monogenean ectoparasite which inhabits the gills of the common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Heavy infestation can lead to anemia and in conjunction with secondary bacterial infections cause poor health and eventual death of the host.\n\nThis study is based on an innovative approach to protein localization which has never been used in parasitology before. Using laser capture microdissection, we dissected particular areas of the parasite body without contaminating the samples by surrounding tissue, and in combination with analysis by mass spectrometry obtained tissue-specific proteomes of tegument, intestine, and parenchyma of our model organism, E. nipponicum. We successfully verified the presence of certain functional proteins (e.g. cathepsin L) in tissues where their presence was expected (intestine) and confirmed that there were no traces of these proteins in other tissues (tegument and parenchyma). Additionally, we identified a total of 2,059 proteins, including 72 peptidases and 33 peptidase inhibitors. As expected, the greatest variety was found in the intestine and the lowest variety in the parenchyma.\n\nOur results are significant on two levels. Firstly, we demonstrated how one can localize all proteins in one analysis and without using laboratory animals (antibodies for immunolocalization of single proteins). Secondly, this study offers the first complex proteomic data on not only the E. nipponicum but within the whole class of Monogenea, which was from this point of view until recently neglected.",

    "abstract": "Response variability following transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) highlights need for exploring different tDCS electrode montages. This study compared corticospinal excitability (CSE), cortico-cortical excitability and intra-individual variability following conventional and HD anodal (a-tDCS) and cathodal (c-tDCS) tDCS. Fifteen healthy young males attended four sessions at least one-week apart: conventional a-tDCS, conventional c-tDCS, HD-a-tDCS, HD-c-tDCS. TDCS was administered (1mA, 10-minutes) over the primary motor cortex (M1), via 6x4cm active and 7x5cm return electrodes (conventional tDCS) and 4x1 ring-electrodes 3.5cm apart in ring formation around M1 (HD-tDCS). For CSE, twenty-five single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) peak-to-peak motor evoked potentials (MEP) were recorded at baseline, 0-minutes and 30-minutes post-tDCS. For cortico-cortical excitability, twenty-five paired-pulse MEPs with 3-millisecond (ms) inter-pulse interval (IPI) and twenty-five at 10ms assessed short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) respectively. MEP standardised z-values standard deviations represented intra-individual variability. No significant differences were reported in CSE between conventional and HD a-tDCS, but significant differences between conventional and HD c-tDCS 0-minutes post-tDCS. Intra-individual variability was significantly reduced in conventional tDCS compared to HD-tDCS for a-tDCS (0-minutes) and c-tDCS (30-minutes). No significant changes were reported in SICI and ICF. These novel findings highlight current technical issues with HD-tDCS, suggesting future tDCS studies should utilise conventional tDCS to minimise intra-individual variability, ensuring tDCS after-effects are true changes in CSE and cortico-cortical excitability.",

    "abstract": "Biological systems not only have the remarkable capacity to build and maintain complex spatio-temporal structures in noisy environments, they can also rapidly break up and rebuild such structures. How such systems can simultaneously achieve both robust specialisation and plasticity is poorly understood. Here we use primitive societies of Polistes wasps as a model system where we experimentally perturb the social structure by removing the queen and follow the re-establishment of the social steady state over time. We combine a unique experimental strategy correlating time-resolved measurements across vastly different scales with a theoretical approach. We show that Polistes integrates antagonistic processes on multiple scales to distinguish between extrinsic and intrinsic perturbations and thereby achieve both robust specialisation and rapid plasticity. The long-term stability of the social structure relies on dynamic DNA methylation which controls transcriptional noise. Such dynamics provide a general principle of how both specialization and plasticity can be achieved in biological systems.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA primitive social insect simultaneously achieves specialisation and plasticity by integrating antagonistic dynamics on different scales.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe employ a unique experimental approach correlating dynamics of societies, individuals, and epigenetic gene regulation\nC_LIO_LIA social insect simultaneously achieves specialisation and plasticity by integrating antagonistic processes on different spatial scales\nC_LIO_LIRegulation of population-level noise by DNA methylation ensures long-term stability of phenotypic specialisation\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Although aging in the liver contributes to the development of chronic liver diseases such as NAFLD and insulin resistance, little known about the molecular and metabolic details of aging in hepatic cells. To examine these issues, we used sequential oxidative stress with hydrogen peroxide to induce premature senescence in AML12 hepatic cells. The senescent cells exhibited molecular and metabolic signatures, increased SA-{beta}Gal and {gamma}H2A.X staining, and elevated senescence and pro-inflammatory gene expression that resembled livers from aged mice. Metabolic phenotyping showed fuel switching towards glycolysis and mitochondrial glutamine oxidation as well as impaired energy production. The senescent AML12 cells also had increased mTOR signaling and decreased autophagy which likely contributed to the fuel switching from {beta}-oxidation that occurred in normal AML12 cells. Additionally, senescence activated secretory proteins from conditioned media of senescent cells sensitized normal AML12 cells to palmitate-induced toxicity, a known pathological effect of hepatic aging. In summary, we have generated senescent AML12 cells which displayed the molecular hallmarks of aging, and also exhibited the aberrant metabolic phenotype, mitochondrial function, and cell signaling that occur in the aged liver.",
