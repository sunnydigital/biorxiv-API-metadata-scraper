    "abstract": "Biocatalytic cascade reactions have become increasingly important and useful for chemical synthesis. However, biocatalysts are often incompatible with organic solvents, which prohibits many cascade reactions involving nonpolar substrates. In this work, we used cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) to express enzymes in an aqueous-organic biphasic system for the construction of an artificial enzymatic pathway. CFPS-expressed enzymes without purification performed efficiently to convert styrene (below 20 mM) to (S)-1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol (two steps in one pot) with 100% conversion. In addition, our CFPS system showed great tolerance to different organic solvents and, importantly, the entire biocatalytic system can be consistently scaled up without reduction of the substrate conversion rate. We therefore anticipate that our cell-free approach will make possible cost-effective, high-yielding synthesis of valuable chemicals.",

    "abstract": "Neophilaenus campestris is one of the recently identified spittlebugs (Hemiptera: Cercopoidea) able to transmit Xylella fastidiosa to olive trees. Considering its vector ability and the wide distribution of this species in Spain, N. campestris should be considered a serious threat to key crops that are vital for Spanish agriculture such as olive, almonds and grapevines. Migration and dispersal abilities of insect vectors have profound implications in the spread of vector-borne diseases. Thus, knowledge on the dispersal ability of N. campestris is essential to model, predict and limit the spread of the diseases caused by X. fastidiosa. A mark-release-recapture technique was developed to track between-field movements of N. campestris during its late spring migration from the ground cover grasses within olive groves to sheltered areas dominated by pine trees. An indoor assay showed that the fluorescent dust used for marking did not affect the survival nor the flying ability of N. campestris. Spittlebug adults captured in olive groves at Los Santos de la Humosa (Madrid, Spain) during late spring, 2019 were dusted with four fluorescent colours and released in four different locations. Six recapture samplings were performed 23 to 42 days after release in 12 different sites located within a maximum distance of 2.8 km from the release point. Results indicated that N. campestris was able to disperse a maximum distance of 2473 m in 35 days from the olive groves to areas dominated by pine trees. Furthermore, our flight mill studies also showed that N. campestris was able to fly long distances, reaching almost 1.4 km in an 82 minutes single flight.\n\nMoreover, we carried out a survey of directional movement of potential vectors of X. fastidiosa in an olive grove located in Villa del Prado (Madrid). We used yellow sticky bands, a Malaise trap and a vertical yellow sticky net to assess the directional movement from olive groves to surrounding managed and unmanaged areas. The captures obtained in the yellow sticky bands showed that spittlebugs dispersal from the olive grove to surrounding vegetation matched with the time when the ground cover dried out. The highest number of spittlebugs was captured in the border between the olive grove and a vineyard close by.\n\nAltogether, our findings suggest that eradication measures by rooting-up X. fastidiosa-infected and non-infected trees in a radius of 100 m are of limited value because vectors are able to disperse rapidly over distances much longer than expected.",

    "abstract": "Community assembly can be driven by species responses to environmental gradients, and interactions within (e.g., competition) and across (e.g., herbivory) clades. These ecological dynamics are mediated by species traits, which are in turn shaped by past evolution. As such, identifying the drivers of species assembly is made difficult by the differing temporal and spatial scales of ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Two recent advances have emerged to address the cross-scale challenge of modeling species assembly: phylogenetic generalized linear mixed modeling (PGLMM) and earth observation networks (EONs). PGLMM integrates through time by modeling the evolution of trait-based community assembly, while EONs synthesize across space by placing standardized site-level species occurrence data within their regional context. Here we describe a framework for combining these tools to investigate the drivers of species assembly, and so address three outstanding questions: (1) Does evolution adapt or constrain regional-scale environmental responses? (2) Do evolved responses to past competition minimize or enhance present-day competition? (3) Are species cross-clade associations evolutionarily constrained? We provide a conceptual overview of how PGLMM and EONs can be synthesized to answer these questions, and provide exemplar Bayesian PGLMM code. Finally, we describe the capacity of these tools to aid in conservation and natural resource management, including predicting future colonization by rare and invasive species, vulnerable mutualisms, and pest and pathogen outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) within species B, C, and E include the predominant types responsible for highly contagious and potentially severe respiratory infections. The traditional method to type these pathogens was based on virus neutralization and hemagglutination assays using antisera, which is both time-consuming and difficult, particularly due to the non-availability of reagents. Molecular typing based on partial characterization of HAdV hexon, as well as the restriction enzyme analysis (REA) of the genomics DNA, is difficult to identify recombinants. Here, a rapid, simple, and cost-effective molecular typing of respiratory HAdVs is presented. This incorporates three pairs of universal PCR primers that target the variable regions of the three major capsid genes, i.e. hexon, penton base and fiber genes. The protocol developed enables detection and typing of respiratory HAdVs within species B, C, and E, as well as of some strains within species D and F. Using this method, we surveyed a total of 100 children with acute respiratory infection caused by HAdVs in Hong Kong, Summer 2014 (July to October). 100 Throat swab specimens were collected. The samples were analyzed by PCR and the sequences were characterized by BLAST. HAdVs were detected in 98 out of 100 (98%) samples. The predominant HAdV type was species B type 3. Among the patients, 74 were of HAdV-B3 (74%), 10 were of HAdV-E4 (10%), 6 were of HAdV-C2 (21.7%), 2 were of HAdV-C6 (2%), 1 were of HAdV-B7 (2%), 1 were of HAdV-C1 (74%), and 2 were of recombinant types. The developed method allows the rapid identification of HAdVs with recombinant genomes, and bypasses the need for whole genome data, for the real-time surveillance of circulating adenovirus strains in immediate outbreaks and populations by clinical microbiologists, public health officers, and epidemiologists.",

    "abstract": "Invasions by non-native pathogens represent a major threat to managed and natural ecosystems worldwide. Although necessary for adopting preventive strategies, the identification of invasive species before they are introduced is particularly difficult. Indeed, most pathogenic species that have become established in the last decades were first described only after they became invasive. To prevent further biological invasions, not only the early identification of potential new invasive plant pathogens is crucial, but also the assessment of their potential host range. In this study, we determined the pathogenicity and the saprotrophic ability of three Cryphonectria species towards three potential hosts in the family Fagaceae. For this, seedlings and dormant stems of European chestnut (Castanea sativa), pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica) were inoculated with different genotypes of C. parasitica (Asian species, invasive in Europe), C. naterciae (European species), and C. japonica (Asian species, not present in Europe). Lesion growth was measured and mortality assessed for four months. The highest damage was caused by C. parasitica on European chestnut, while C. japonica and C. naterciae induced significantly smaller lesions on this host species. All three Cryphonectria species did not grow saprophytically on F. sylvatica and Q. robur, but successfully colonized dormant stems of C. sativa. In the context of biological invasions, our study shows that the Asian C. japonica most likely represents a much less severe threat than C. parasitica for the tested European host species. Nonetheless, the ability of C. naterciae and C. japonica to saprotrophically colonize fresh chestnut wood may suggest that they could become established in chestnut forests and eventually infect weakened chestnut trees or other hosts not tested in this study.",

To define genomewide enhancer and promoter use in heart failure, Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE-seq) was applied to healthy and failed human left ventricles to define short RNAs associated with both promoters and enhancers. Integration of CAGE-seq data with RNA sequencing identified a combined [~]17,000 promoters and [~]1,500 enhancers active in healthy and failed human left ventricles. Comparing promoter usage between healthy and failed hearts highlighted promoter shifts which altered amino-terminal protein sequences. Comparing enhancer usage between healthy and failed hearts revealed a majority of differentially utilized heart failure enhancers were intronic and primarily localized within the first intron, identifying this position as a common feature associated with tissue-specific gene expression changes in the heart. This dataset defines the dynamic genomic regulatory landscape underlying heart failure and serves as an important resource for understanding genetic contributions to cardiac dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "The antibody repertoires of different individuals ought to exhibit significant functional commonality, given that most pathogens trigger a successful immune response in most people. Sequence-based approaches have so far offered little evidence for this phenomenon. For example, a recent study estimated the number of shared ( public) antibody clonotypes in circulating baseline repertoires to be around 0.02% across ten unrelated individuals. However, to engage the same epitope, antibodies only require a similar binding site structure and the presence of key paratope interactions, which can occur even when their sequences are dissimilar. Here, we investigate functional convergence in human antibody repertoires by comparing the anti-body structures they contain. We first structurally profile base-line antibody diversity (using snapshots from 41 unrelated individuals), predicting all modellable distinct structures within each repertoire. This analysis uncovers a high (much greater than random) degree of structural commonality. For instance, around 3% of distinct structures are common to the ten most diverse individual samples ( Public Baseline structures). Our approach is the first computational method to provide support for the long-assumed levels of baseline repertoire functional commonality. We then apply the same structural profiling approach to repertoire snapshots from three individuals before and after flu vaccination, detecting a convergent structural drift indicative of recognising similar epitopes ( Public Response structures). Antibody Model Libraries derived from Public Baseline and Public Response structures represent a powerful geometric basis set of low-immunogenicity candidates exploitable for general or target-focused therapeutic antibody screening.",

As they grow primarily in isolated groves within a narrow range, conservation of existing trees has been a national goal for over 150 years. Genomic data are limited in giant sequoia, and the assembly and annotation of the first giant sequoia genome has been an important goal to allow marker development for restoration and management. Using Illumina and Oxford Nanopore sequencing combined with Dovetail chromosome conformation capture libraries, 8.125 Gbp of sequence was assembled into eleven chromosome-scale scaffolds. This giant sequoia assembly represents the first genome sequenced in the Cupressaceae family, and lays a foundation for using genomic tools to aid in giant sequoia conservation and management. Beyond conservation and management applications, the giant sequoia assembly is a resource for answering questions about the life history of this enigmatic and robust species.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThere is an ongoing debate whether trimethylamine-oxide (TMAO), a molecule present in seafood and a derivate of microbiota metabolism, is beneficial or harmful for the circulatory system. Interestingly, deep-water animals accumulate TMAO that protects proteins such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) against high hydrostatic pressure. We hypothesized that TMAO may benefit the circulatory system by protecting cardiac LDH exposed to hydrostatic stress (HS) produced by contracting heart.\n\nMethods and ResultsMale, 6-week-old, Sprague-Dawley (SD, n=40) and Spontaneously-Hypertensive-Heart-Failure (SHHF n=18) rats were divided into either Water or TMAO oral treatment. After 56 weeks, half of Water and TMAO SD rats were given isoprenaline (ISO) to produce catecholamine stress. In vitro, LDH with or without TMAO was exposed to HS (changes in pressure 0-250mmHg x 280min-1) and was evaluated using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. After 58 weeks of the treatment survival was 100% in SD-Water, SD-TMAO, ISO-TMAO and 90% in ISO-Water. In SHHF-Water survival was 66% vs 100% in SHHF-TMAO. In general, TMAO-treated rats showed higher diuresis and natriuresis. In comparison to SHHF-Water, SHHF-TMAO showed significantly lower diastolic arterial blood pressure, plasma NT-proBNP and expression of angiotensinogen and AT1 receptors in the heart. In separate experiments, intravenous TMAO but not vehicle or urea significantly increased diuresis in SD. In vitro, exposure of LDH to HS with or without TMAO did not affect the protein structure.\n\nConclusionsTMAO reduces mortality in SHHF rats that is associated with diuretic, natriuretic and hypotensive effects. HS produced by the contracting heart is neutral for cardiac LDH structure.",

We established gestational timepoint-specific enrichment profiles involving histone H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac), H3K4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3), and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) occupancy by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), as well as gene expression profiles by total RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). Our findings reveal that 533 genes, including known contractility-driving genes (Gja1, Fos, Oxtr, Ptgs2), are upregulated during active labor due to an increase in transcription at gene bodies. Their promoters and putative intergenic enhancers, however, are epigenetically activated by H3K27ac as early as day 15, four days prior to the onset of active labor on day 19. In fact, we find that the majority of genome-wide H3K27ac or H3K4me3 peaks identified during active labor are present in the myometrium on day 15. Despite the early presence of H3K27ac at labor-associated genes, both an increase in non-coding enhancer RNA (eRNA) production, and in recruitment of RNAPII to corresponding genes occur during active labor, at labor upregulated gene loci. Our findings indicate that epigenetic activation of the myometrial genome precedes active labor by at least four days in the mouse model, suggesting the myometrium is poised for rapid activation of contraction-associated genes in order to exit the state of quiescence.",

    "abstract": "Dominance hierarchies are common in social mammals, especially primates. The formation of social hierarchies is conducive to solving the problem of the allocation of scarce resources among individuals. From August 2015 to July 2016, we observed a wild, provisioned Yunnan snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus bieti) group at Xiangguqing in Baimaxueshan National Nature Reserve, Yunnan Province, China. Aggressive and submissive behaviors were used to investigate dominance hierarchies between female individuals in the same one-male unit (OMU), and the grooming reciprocity index was used to detect reciprocal relationships between these females within the OMU. The results showed that loose social hierarchies exist among the females in each OMU, and more dominant individuals have higher grooming incomes. These results are consistent with the aggressive-submissive hypothesis and the resource control hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Hurricanes rapidly deposit large amounts of canopy material onto tropical forest floors, stimulating metabolic processes involved in the decomposition of these materials and production of N and C resources into the food web. However, little is known about the effects that hurricanes have on specific soil microbial taxa or functional groups involved in these processes. The objectives of this study were to determine how Hurricane Otto influenced three different tropical forest soil ecosystems within the first 8 months after causing damage to a tropical forest by assessing the soil C and N factors and how the soil bacterial and fungal community compositions differed before and after the hurricane. Soil samples were collected from five 2000 m2 permanent plots in Lowland, Upland and Riparian forest systems within the same area in the Northern Zone of Costa Rica. Standard methods were used to measure the amounts Total N, NO3-, NH4+, Total organic C, and Biomass C, while Illumina MiSeq methods were used to generate bacterial and fungal sequences. All data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate statistical methods. Using this \"before and after\" study design, it was found that the levels of the inorganic N and Biomass C were greater in the Post-Hurricane soil samples. The mean proportion of DNA sequences of complex C degrading/lignin degrading, NH4+-producing, and ammonium oxidizing bacteria, and the complex C degrading/wood rot/lignin degrading and ectomycorrhizal fungi also were greater in the Post-Hurricane soils. We also provide evidence that the excessive amounts of canopy leaf litter and woody debris deposited on the forest floor during Hurricane Otto appears to be selecting for genera that become more dominant Post-Hurricane, perhaps because they may be better able to rapidly process the newly deposited C and N-rich canopy material. This is a rare \"before and after\" a natural hurricane design that warrants further monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Daily rhythms are disrupted in patients suffering from mood disorders. The lateral habenula (LHb) and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) contribute to circadian timekeeping and regulate mood. Thus, pathophysiology in these nuclei may be responsible for aberrations in daily rhythms during mood disorders. Using the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) paradigm and in-vitro slice electrophysiology we measured the effects of stress on diurnal rhythms in firing of LHb cells projecting to the DRN (cellsLHb[-&gt;]DRN) and DRN cells alone. We also performed optogenetic experiments to investigate if increased firing in cellsLHb[-&gt;]DRN during exposure to subthreshold social defeat stress (SSDS), induces stress-susceptibility. Last we investigated whether exposure to CSDS affected the ability of mice to phototentrain to a new LD cycle. The cellsLHb[-&gt;]DRN and DRN cells alone of stress-susceptible mice express greater blunted diurnal firing compared to stress-naive (control) and stress-resilient mice. Day-time optogenetic activation of cellsLHb[-&gt;]DRN during SSDS induces stress-susceptibility which shows the direct correlation between increased activity in this circuit and putative mood disorders. Finally, we found that stress-susceptible mice are slower, while stress-resilient mice are faster, at photoentraining to a new LD cycle. Our findings suggest that CSDS induces blunted daily rhythms in firing in cellsLHb[-&gt;]DRN and slow rate of photoentrainment in susceptible-mice. In contrast, resilientmice may undergo homeostatic adaptations that maintain daily rhythms in firing in cellsLHb[-&gt;]DRN and also show rapid photoentrainment to a new LD-cycle.",

    "abstract": "Computer Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a popular method for studying airflow of nasal cavities. However, the data of CFD studies has rarely been validated through experiments. To test the accuracy of CFD computation, we studied the consistency of the air pressure of nasal cavities in the CFD and the experiment. A proportional resin model of a normal human subjects nasal cavities was created by a 3-d printer with a precision value of 0.1mm. The pressure of 63 check points in the nasal cavities in different breathing states was measured. The experimental data was compared with the data obtained by CFD simulation. At the flow rates of 180 ml s-1 and 560 ml s-1, the pressure in all check points remained highly consistent with the CFD data. At 1100 ml s-1 flow rate, there was a significant deviation in the posterior segment of the nasal cavity during exhalation. The method used in this study to measure the pressure in the nasal cavities can be used in experimental validation of CFD data. The computational methods and the boundary conditions used in this study resulted in a high agreement between the results of the CFD simulation and the experiment.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn the contemporary era, Computer fluid dynamics (CFD) is the mainstream method for studying air flow. Due to the complex anatomical structure of the nasal cavity, the CFD results of the nasal flow have rarely been experimentally verified. This study provides a method to verify the methods and results of nasal CFD. We printed an accurate model of a normal persons nasal cavity with a high-precision 3D printer. In this nasal cavity model, we set 63 small holes to detect the air pressure of the places we concerned. Three different nasal flow quantity are used to represent different breathing conditions: high (1100 ml s-1), medium (560 ml s-1), and low (180 ml s-1). In medium and low nasal flow quantities, our CFD results are in good agreement with the experimental pressure values. On this basis, we analyzed the characteristics of nasal airflow in normal people. The method used in this study to measure the pressure in the nasal cavities can be used in experimental measurements of the partial resistance of the nasal cavity. With proper modification, it can be applied to the clinical practice for nasal resistance, giving more help for the design of the operation plan.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundsObservational studies plays an important role in urology studies, But few studies have paid attention to the statistical reporting quality of observational studies. The purpose of this study was to investigate the frequency and evaluate the reporting quality of statistical methods of the published observational studies in urology.\n\nMethodsThe five urology journals were selected according to the 5-year impact factor. A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed for relevant articles. The quality of statistical reporting was assessed according to assessment criteria.\n\nResultsA total of 193 articles were included in this study. The mean statistical reporting score of included articles was 0.42 (SD=0.15), accounting for 42% of total score. The items that must be reported with a reporting rate more than 50% were: alpha level (n=122, 65.2%), confidence intervals (n=134, 69.4%), name of statistical package (n=158, 84.5%) and exact P-values (n=161, 86.1%). The items with a reporting rate less than 50% were: outliers (n=2, 1.0%) and sample size (n=13, 6.7%). For multivariable regression models (liner, logistic and Cox), variables coding (n=27, 40.7%), validation analysis of assumptions (n=58, 40.3%), interaction test (n=43, 30.0%), collinearity diagnostics (n=5, 3.5%) and goodness of fit test (n=6, 5.9%) were reported. Number of authors more than 7(OR=2.06, 95%CI=1.04-4.08) and participation of statistician or epidemiologist (OR=1.73, 95%CI=1.18-3.39) were associated with the superior reporting quality.\n\nConclusionThe statistical reporting quality of published observational studies in 5 high-impact factor urological journals was alarming. We encourage researchers to collaborate with statistician or epidemiologist. The authors, reviewers and editors should increase their knowledge of statistical methods, especially new and complex methods.",
