    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is a notorious bacterial pathogen that often causes soft tissue and bloodstream infections and invariably garners resistance mechanisms against new antibiotics. Host innate immunity modulated by metabolites has been proved as a powerful strategy against bacterial infections. However, few studies focus on the application of this strategy against S. aureus infection. Here, we identified four metabolite biomarkers, L-proline, L-isoleucine, L-leucine, and L-valine (PILV), by a metabolomics study. In animal models of S. aureus bloodstream infection, exogenous administration of each metabolite or PILV shows an anti-infective effect, while PILV treatment has higher protection than individual metabolite treatment. Each metabolite targets nitric oxide (NO) to kill S. aureus via arginase inhibition, and PILV exhibits additive inhibition of arginase activity that causes further killing. This suppression also contributes to the metabolite-mediated phagocytic killing of S. aureus in human blood. Our finding demonstrates the metabolite-mediated innate immunity as a therapeutic intervention for S. aureus infection.",

    "abstract": "Acute tendon injuries are characterized by excessive matrix deposition that impedes regeneration and disrupts functional improvements. Inflammation is postulated to drive pathologic scar tissue formation, with nuclear factor kappa B (NF-{kappa}B) signaling emerging as a candidate pathway in this process. However, characterization of the spatial and temporal activation of canonical NF-{kappa}B signaling during tendon healing in vivo, including identification of the cell populations activating NF-{kappa}B, is currently unexplored. Therefore, we aimed to determine which cell populations activate canonical NF-{kappa}B signaling following flexor tendon repair with the goal of delineating cell-specific functions of NF-{kappa}B signaling during scar mediated tendon healing. Immunofluorescence revealed that both tendon cells and myofibroblasts exhibit prolonged activation of canonical NF-{kappa}B signaling into the remodeling phase of healing. Using cre-mediated knockout of the canonical NF-{kappa}B kinase (IKK{beta}), we discovered that suppression of canonical NF-{kappa}B signaling in Scleraxis-lineage cells increased myofibroblast content and scar tissue formation. Interestingly, Scleraxis-lineage specific knockout of IKK{beta} increased the incidence of apoptosis, suggesting that canonical NF-{kappa}B signaling may be mediating cell survival during tendon healing. These findings suggest indispensable roles for canonical NF-{kappa}B signaling during flexor tendon healing.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryScleraxis-lineage specific knockdown of persistent canonical IKK{beta}/NF-{kappa}B drives scar formation and apoptotic signaling during flexor tendon healing.",

    "abstract": "-synuclein (aSyn) is a major player in Parkinsons disease (PD) and a group of other disorders collectively known as synucleinopathies, but the precise molecular mechanisms involved are still unclear. aSyn, as virtually all proteins, undergoes a series of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) during its lifetime which can affect its biology and pathobiology. We recently showed that glycation of aSyn by methylglyoxal (MGO) potentiates its oligomerization and toxicity, induces dopaminergic neuronal cell loss in mice, and affects motor performance in flies. Small heat-shock proteins (sHsps) are molecular chaperones that facilitate the folding of proteins or target misfolded proteins for clearance. Importantly, sHsps were shown to prevent aSyn aggregation and cytotoxicity. Upon treating cells with increasing amounts of methylglyoxal, we found that the levels of Hsp27 decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, we hypothesized that restoring the levels of Hsp27 in glycating environments could alleviate the pathogenicity of aSyn. Consistently, we found that Hsp27 reduced MGO-induced aSyn aggregation in cells, leading to the formation of non-toxic aSyn species. Remarkably, increasing the levels of Hsp27 suppressed the deleterious effects induced by MGO. Our findings suggest that in glycating environments, the levels of Hsp27 are important for modulating the glycation-associated cellular pathologies in synucleinopathies.",

The nature of outcome signals and their neuronal and network realization in motor cortex (M1), which commands the performance of skilled movements, is largely unknown. Using a dexterity task, calcium imaging, optogenetic perturbations, and behavioral manipulations, we studied outcome signals in murine M1. We find two populations of layer 2-3 neurons, \"success\"- and \"failure\" related neurons that develop with training and report end-result of trials. In these neurons, prolonged responses were recorded after success or failure trials, independent of reward and kinematics. In contrast, the initial state of layer-5 pyramidal tract neurons contains a memory trace of the previous trials outcome. Inter-trial cortical activity was needed to learn new task requirements. These M1 reflective layer-specific performance outcome signals, can support reinforcement motor learning of skilled behavior.",

    "abstract": "Hearing loss is associated with changes at the peripheral, subcortical, and cortical auditory stages. Research often focuses on these stages in isolation, but peripheral damage has cascading effects on central processing, and different stages are interconnected through extensive feedforward and feedback projections. Accordingly, assessment of the entire auditory system is needed to understand auditory pathology. Using a novel stimulus paired with electroencephalography in young, normal-hearing adults, we assess neural function at multiple stages of the auditory pathway simultaneously. We employ click trains that repeatedly accelerate then decelerate (3.5 Hz frequency modulation; FM) introducing varying inter-click-intervals (4 to 40 ms). We measured the amplitude of cortical potentials, and the latencies and amplitudes of Waves III and V of the auditory brainstem response (ABR), to clicks as a function of preceding inter-click-interval. This allowed us to assess cortical processing of frequency modulation, as well as adaptation and neural recovery time in subcortical structures (probably cochlear nuclei and inferior colliculi). Subcortical adaptation to inter-click intervals was reflected in longer latencies. Cortical responses to the 3.5 Hz FM included phase-locking, probably originating from auditory cortex, and sustained activity likely originating from higher-level cortices. We did not observe any correlations between subcortical and cortical responses. By recording neural responses from different stages of the auditory system simultaneously, we can study functional relationships among levels of the auditory system, which may provide a new and helpful window on hearing and hearing impairment.",

    "abstract": "The diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia comprise a diverse range of heterogeneous symptoms. As a result, individuals each present a distinct set of symptoms despite having the same overall diagnosis. Whilst previous machine learning studies have primarily focused on dichotomous patient-control classification, we predict the severity of each individual symptom on a continuum. We applied machine learning regression within a multi-modal fusion framework to fMRI and behavioural data acquired during an auditory oddball task in 80 schizophrenia patients. Brain activity was highly predictive of some, but not all symptoms, namely hallucinations, avolition, anhedonia and attention. Critically, each of these symptoms was associated with specific functional alterations across different brain regions. We also found that modelling symptoms as an ensemble of subscales was more accurate, specific and informative than models which predict compound scores directly. In principle, this approach is transferrable to any psychiatric condition or multi-dimensional diagnosis.",

Grid cell modules in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) express activity patterns that span a low-dimensional manifold which remains stable across different environments. In contrast, the activity patterns of hippocampal place cells span distinct low-dimensional manifolds in different environments. It is unknown how these multiple representations of position are coordinated. Here we develop a theory of joint attractor dynamics in the hippocampus and the MEC. We show that the system exhibits a coordinated, joint representation of position across multiple environments, consistent with global remapping in place cells and grid cells. We then show that our model accounts for recent experimental observations that lack a mechanistic explanation: variability in the firing rate of single grid cells across firing fields, and artificial remapping of place cells under depolarization, but not under hyperpolarization, of layer II stellate cells of the MEC.",

    "abstract": "Recordings from large neural populations are becoming an increasingly popular and accessible method in experimental neuroscience. While the activity of individual neurons is often too stochastic to interrogate circuit function on a moment-by-moment basis, multi-neuronal recordings enable us to do so by pooling statistical power across many cells. For example, groups of neurons often exhibit correlated gain or amplitude modulation across trials, which can be statistically formalized in a tensor decomposition framework (Williams et al. 2018). Additionally, the time course of neural population dynamics can be shifted or stretched/compressed, which can be modeled by time warping methods (Williams et al. 2020). Here, I describe how these two modeling frameworks can be combined, and show some evidence that doing so can be highly advantageous for practical neural data analysis--for example, the presence of random time shifts hampers the performance and interpretability of tensor decomposition, while a time-shifted variant of this model corrects for these disruptions and uncovers ground truth structure in simulated data.",

It is considered that the division site in land plants is predetermined prior to mitosis and that the localization of the mitotic spindle does not govern the division plane. This contrasts with animal ACD, in which the division site is defined by active spindle-positioning mechanisms. Here, we isolated a hypomorphic mutant of the conserved microtubule-associated protein TPX2 in the moss Physcomitrium patens and observed abnormal spindle motility during cell division. This defect compromised the position of the division site and produced inverted daughter cell sizes in the first ACD of gametophore (leafy shoot) development. The phenotype was rescued by restoring endogenous TPX2 function and, unexpectedly, by depolymerizing actin filaments. Thus, we have identified an active spindle-positioning mechanism that, reminiscent of acentrosomal ACD in animals, involves microtubules and actin filaments and sets the division site in plants.",

    "abstract": "The future of plant cultivar improvement lies in the evaluation of genetic resources from currently available germplasm. Recent efforts in plant breeding have been aimed at developing new and improved varieties from poorly adapted crops to suit local environments. However, the impact of these breeding efforts is poorly understood. Here, we assess the contributions of both historical and recent breeding efforts to local adaptation and crop improvement in a global barley panel by analysing the distribution of genetic variants with respect to geographic region or historical breeding category. By tracing the impact breeding had on the genetic diversity of barley released in Australia, where the history of barley production is relatively young, we identify 69 candidate regions within 922 genes that were under selection pressure. We also show that modern Australian barley varieties exhibit 12% higher genetic diversity than historical cultivars. Finally, field-trialling and phenotyping for agriculturally relevant traits across a diverse range of Australian environments suggests that genomic regions under strong breeding selection and their candidate genes are closely associated with key agronomic traits. In conclusion, our combined dataset and germplasm collection provide a rich source of genetic diversity that can be applied to understanding and improving environmental adaptation and enhanced yields.\n\nAuthor summaryTodays gene pool of crop genetic diversity has been shaped during domestication and more recently by breeding. Genetic diversity is vital for crop species to be able to adapt to changing environments. There is concern that recent breeding efforts have eroded the genetic diversity of many domesticated crops including barley. The present study assembled a global panel of barley genotypes with a focus on historical and modern Australian varieties.\n\nGenome-wide data was used to detect genes that are thought to have been under selection during crop breeding in Australian barley. The results demonstrate that despite being more extensively bred, modern Australian barley varieties exhibit higher genetic diversity than historical cultivars, countering the common perception that intensive breeding leads to genetic erosion of adaptive diversity in modern cultivars. In addition, some loci (particularly those related to phenology) were subject to selection during the introduction of other barley varieties to Australia - these genes might continue to be important targets in breeding efforts in the face of changing climatic conditions.",

    "abstract": "The diversity of life on our planet has produced a remarkable variety of biological traits that characterize different species. Such traits are widely employed instead of taxonomy to increase our understanding of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. However, for species trophic niches, one of the most critical aspects of organismal ecology, a paucity of empirical information has led to inconsistent definitions of trophic guilds based on expert opinion. Using coral reef fishes as a model, we show that experts often disagree on the assignment of trophic guilds for the same species. Even when broad categories are assigned, 60% of the evaluated trait schemes disagree on the attribution of trophic categories for at least 20% of the species. This disagreement greatly hampers comparability across studies. Here, we introduce a quantitative, unbiased, and fully reproducible framework to define species trophic guilds based on empirical data. First, we synthesize data from community-wide visual gut content analysis of tropical coral reef fishes, resulting in trophic information from 13,961 individuals belonging to 615 reef fish species across all ocean basins. We then use network analysis to cluster the resulting global bipartite food web into distinct trophic guilds, resulting in eight trophic guilds, and employ a Bayesian phylogenetic model to predict trophic guilds based on phylogeny and maximum body size. Our model achieved a misclassification error of 5%, indicating that our approach results in a quantitative and reproducible trophic categorization scheme, which can be updated as new information becomes available. Although our case study is for reef fishes, the most diverse vertebrate consumer group, our approach can be applied to other organismal groups to advance reproducibility in trait-based ecology. As such, our work provides an empirical and conceptual advancement for trait-based ecology and a viable approach to monitor ecosystem functioning in our changing world.",

We found that cultures with Lineage- SCA1+ KIT+ (LSK) cells on Ctsk deficient stromal cells display reduced colony formation and proliferation, with increased differentiation, giving rise to repopulating cells with reduced ability to repopulate the donor LSK and T cell compartments in the bone marrow. Subsequent in vivo experiments showed impairment of lymphocyte numbers, but, gross effects on early hematopoiesis or myelopoiesis were not found. Most consistently in in vivo experimental settings, we found a significant reduction of (donor) T cell numbers in the bone marrow. Lymphocyte deregulation is also found in transplantation experiments, which revealed that Ctsk is required for optimal regeneration not only of T cells, but also of B cells. Interestingly, cell non-autonomous Ctsk regulates both B- and T cell numbers, but T cell numbers in the bone marrow require an additional autonomous Ctsk-dependent process. Thus, we show that Ctsk is required for the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells in vitro, but in vivo, Ctsk deficiency most strongly affects lymphocyte homeostasis, particularly of T cells in the bone marrow.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium ulcerans is a non-tuberculous environmental mycobacterium responsible for extensive cutaneous and subcutaneous ulcers in mammals, named Buruli ulcer in patients. M. ulcerans has been seldom detected in the feces of mammals but not in patients, nevertheless the detection and isolation of M. ulcerans in animal feces does not feet with the current epidemiological schemes for the disease. Here using an experimental model in which rats were fed with 109 colony-forming units of M. ulcerans, we detected M. ulcerans in feces of challenged rats for two weeks and along their digestive tract for 10 days. M. ulcerans was further detected in the lymphatic system including cervical and axillary lymph nodes and the spleen, but not in any other tissue including the healthy and breached skin, 10 days post-challenge. These observations indicate that in some herbivorous mammals, M. ulcerans contamination by the digestive route may precede translocation and limited infection of the lymphatic tissues without systemic infection. These herbivorous mammals may be sources of M. ulcerans for exposed populations but are unlikely reservoirs for the pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Leishmania infantum infantum (LII) is one of the species that causes visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in the Old World, while L. infantum chagasi (LIC), and is present in the New World. Few studies address the biological differences, as well as the behaviour of these strains during infection. These parasites live inside the cells of their hosts, continuously evading the microbicidal mechanisms and modulating the immune response of these cells. One of the mechanisms used by these protozoa involves the L-arginine metabolism. Given the importance of the understanding of differences between Leishmania species, as well as establishing a better murine model to study leishmaniases, the objectives of this work were to analyse the biological and molecular differences between two Leishmania infantum strains (LII and LIC) and the degree of susceptibility of mice with different genetic backgrounds to infection, as well as to understand the role of arginase (ARG)/nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in the parasite-host relationship. The infectivity in vivo and in vitro of LII and LIC was performed in BALB/c and Swiss Webster mice, as well the NOS and ARG activities. The LII strain showed more infective than the LIC strain both in vivo and in vitro. In animals infected by both strains, a difference in NOS and ARG activities occurred. In vitro, promastigotes of LII isolated from BALB/c and Swiss Webster mice showed higher ARG activity than the LIC during the growth curve, however, no difference was observed in intracellular NO production by promastigotes between these strains. A comparison of the sequences of the ARG gene was made and both strains were identical. However, despite the similarity, the strains showed different expression of this gene. It can be concluded that although L. chagasi strains are considered identical to L. infantum strains, both have different biological behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae is the major pathogen causing enzootic pneumonia in pigs. M. hyopneumoniae infection can lead to considerable economic losses in the pig-breeding industry. Here, this study established a first-order absorption, one-compartment model to study the relationship between the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) index of tilmicosin against M. hyopneumoniae in vitro. We simulated the drug concentration of timicosin in the fluid lining the lung epithelia of pigs. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of tilmicosin against M. hyopneumoniae with an inoculum of 106 CFU/mL was 1.6 g/mL using the microdilution method. Static time-kill curves showed that, if the drug concentration >1 MIC, the antibacterial effect showed different degrees of inhibition. At 32 MIC, the amount of bacteria decreased by 3.16 log10 CFU/mL, thereby achieving a mycoplasmacidal effect. The M. hyopneumoniae count was reduced from 3.61 to 5.11 log10 CFU/mL upon incubation for 96 h in a dynamic model with a dose of 40-200 mg, thereby achieving mycoplasmacidal activity. The peak concentration by MIC (Cmax/MIC) and the area under the concentration-time curve over 96 h divided by the MIC (AUC0-96 h/MIC) were the best-fit PK/PD parameters for predicting the antibacterial activity of tilmicosin against M. hyopneumoniae (R2 = 0.99), suggesting that tilmicosin had concentration-dependent activity. The estimated value for Cmax/MIC and AUC0-96 h/MIC for 2log10 (CFU/mL) reduction and 3log10 (CFU/mL) reduction from baseline was 1.44 and 1.91, and 70.55 h and 96.72 h, respectively. Four M. hyopneumoniae strains (M1-M4) with reduced sensitivity to tilmicosin were isolated from the four dose groups. The susceptibility of these strains to tylosin, erythromycin and lincomycin was also reduced significantly. For sequencing analyses of 23S rRNA, an acquired A2058G transition in region V was found only in resistant M. hyopneumoniae strains (M3, M4). In conclusion, in an in vitro model, the effect of tilmicosin against M. hyopneumoniae was concentration-dependent and had a therapeutic effect. These results will help to design the optimal dosing regimen for tilmicosin in M. hyopneumoniae infection, and minimize the emergence of resistant bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Winter squash fruits (Cucurbita moschata D.) are among the best sources of vitamin A precursors and constitute sources of bioactive components such as phenolic compounds and flavonoids. Approximately 70% of C. moschata seed oil is made up of unsaturated fatty acids, with high levels of monounsaturated fatty acids and components such as vitamin E and carotenoids, which represent a promising nutritional aspect in the production of this vegetable. C. moschata germplasm expresses high genetic variability, especially in Brazil. We assessed 91 C. moschata accessions, from different regions of Brazil, and maintained at the UFV Vegetable Germplasm Bank, to identify early-flowering accessions with high levels of carotenoids in the fruit pulp and high yields of seed and seed oil. Results showed that the accessions have high variability in the number and mass of seeds per fruit, number of accumulated degree-days for flowering, total carotenoid content, and fruit productivity, which allowed selection for considerable gains in these characteristics. Analysis of the correlation between these characteristics provided information that will assist in selection to improve this crop. Cluster analysis resulted in the formation of 16 groups, confirming the variability of the accessions. Per se analysis identified accessions BGH-6749, BGH-5639, and BGH-219 as those with the earliest flowering. Accessions BGH-5455A and BGH-5598A had the highest carotenoid content, with averages greater than 170.00 g g-1 of fresh mass. With a productivity of 0.13 t ha-1, accessions BGH-5485A, BGH-4610A, and BGH-5472A were the most promising for seed oil production. These last two accessions corresponded to those with higher seed productivity, averaging 0.58 and 0.54 t ha-1, respectively. This study confirms the high potential of this germplasm for use in breeding for promotion of earlier flowering and increase in total carotenoid content of the fruit pulp and in seed and seed oil productivity.",

    "abstract": "1Structural changes in proteins allow them to exist in several conformations. Non-covalent interactions with ligands drive the structural changes, thereby allowing the protein to perform its biological function. Recent findings suggest that many proteins are always in an equilibrium of different conformations and that each of these conformations can be formed by both the ligand-free and ligand-bound protein. By using classical statistical mechanics, we derived the equilibrium probabilities of forming a conformation with and without ligand. We found, under certain conditions, that increasing the probability of forming a conformation by the ligand-free protein also increases the probability of forming the same conformation when the protein has a ligand bound. Further, we found that changes in the conformational equilibrium of the ligand-free protein can increase or decrease the affinity for the ligand.",

    "abstract": "The neural crest cells are embryonic stem cells that migrate throughout embryos and, at different target locations, give rise to the formation of a variety of tissues and organs. The directional migration of the neural crest cells is experimentally described using a process referred to as contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL), by which cells redirect their movement upon the cell-cell contacts. However, it is unclear how the migration alignment is affected by the motility properties of the cells. Here, we computationally model the migration alignment and the average time to reach a target location as functions of the motility dynamics and interaction of the cells in an open domain with a channel geometry. The results indicate that by varying the properties of the CIL interaction a transition takes place from random movement of the cells to an organized collective migration, where the migration alignment is maximised and the migration time is minimised. This phase transition is accelerated and strengthened with the influx rate of the cells into the domain through increasing the density of the migrating cells. The model further suggests that the migration is more coordinated when the cells with a large CIL radius move fast in a narrow domain.",

    "abstract": "Accurate maintenance of organelle identity in the secretory pathway relies on retention and retrieval of resident proteins. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), secretory proteins are packaged into COPII vesicles that largely exclude ER residents and misfolded proteins by mechanisms that remain unresolved. Here we combined biochemistry and genetics with correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) to explore how selectivity is achieved. Our data suggest that vesicle occupancy dictates ER retention: in the absence of abundant cargo, non-specific bulk flow increases. We demonstrate that ER leakage is influenced by vesicle size and cargo occupancy: overexpressing an inert cargo protein, or reducing vesicle size restores sorting stringency. We propose that cargo recruitment into vesicles creates lumenal steric pressure that drives selectivity. Sorting stringency is thus an emergent property of the biophysical process of cargo enrichment into a constrained spherical membrane-bound carrier.\n\nSummaryCombining correlative light and electron microscopy with yeast genetics and biochemistry, Gomez-Navarro, Melero and colleagues show that cargo recruitment into a constrained COPII vesicle restricts bulk flow, thereby contributing to sorting stringency and ER quality control.",

Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) can form aggregates reflecting the post-occipital embryo (gastruloids), but lacking proper morphogenesis. Here we show that embedding of aggregates derived from mESCs in an extracellular matrix compound results in Trunk-Like-Structures (TLS) with a high level of organization comprising a neural tube and somites. Comparative single-cell RNA-seq analysis demonstrates that TLS execute gene-regulatory programs in an embryo-like order, and generate primordial germ cell like cells (PGCLCs). TLS lacking Tbx6 form ectopic neural tubes, mirroring the embryonic mutant phenotype. ESC-derived trunk-like structures thus constitute a novel powerful in vitro platform for investigating lineage decisions and morphogenetic processes shaping the post-implantation embryo.\n\nOne sentence summaryA platform for generating trunk-like-structures with precursors of spinal cord, bone and muscle from stem cells in a dish",
