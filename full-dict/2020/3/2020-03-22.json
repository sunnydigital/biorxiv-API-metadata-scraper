    "abstract": "We studied phototaxis, the directional movement relative to light, in the bumble bee Bombus terrestris. We first developed and validated a MATLAB based system enabling reliable high-resolution tracking of a bee and a measurement of her distance relative to a changing LED light source. Using this system we found in all our experiments that workers show positive phototaxis. The strength of the phototactic response was influenced by body size but not age, and this effect was significant when the light source was weak. In a separate experiment, foragers showed stronger phototactic response compared to nurses only in one of two trials in which they were larger and tested with weak light intensity. The evidence that phototaxis is associated with size-based division of labor in the bumble bee and with age-related division of labor in the honey bee, lends credence to response threshold models implicating the response to light in the organization of division of labor in cavity dwelling social insects.",

    "abstract": "Microbes routinely face the challenge of acquiring territory and resources on wet surfaces. Cells move in large groups inside thin, surface-bound water layers, often achieving speeds of 30 {micro}m/s within this environment, where viscous forces dominate over inertial forces (low Reynolds number). The canonical Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis is a model organism for the study of collective migration over surfaces with groups exhibiting motility on length scales three orders of magnitude larger than themselves within a few doubling times. Genetic and chemical studies clearly show that the secretion of endogenous surfactants and availability of free surface water are required for this fast group motility. Here we show that: (i) water availability is a sensitive control parameter modulating an abiotic jamming-like transition that determines whether the group remains fluidized and therefore collectively motile, (ii) groups self-organize into discrete layers as they travel, (iii) group motility does not require proliferation, rather groups are pulled from the front, and (iv) flow within expanding groups is capable of moving material from the parent colony into the expanding tip of a cellular dendrite with implications for expansion into regions of varying nutrient content. Together, these findings illuminate the physical structure of surface-motile groups and demonstrate that physical properties, like cellular packing fraction and flow, regulate motion from the scale of individual cells up to length scales of centimeters.",

    "abstract": "The brain derives cognitive maps from sensory experience that guide memory formation and behavior. Despite extensive efforts, it still remains unclear how the underlying population activity relates to active behavior and memory performance. To examine these processes, we here combined 7T-fMRI with a kernel-based encoding model of virtual navigation to map world-centered directional tuning across the human cortex. First, we present an in-depth analysis of directional tuning in visual, retrosplenial, parahippocampal and medial temporal cortices. Second, we show that tuning strength, width and topology of this directional code during memory-guided navigation depend on successful encoding of the environment. Finally, we show that participants locomotory state influences this tuning in sensory and mnemonic regions such as the hippocampus. We demonstrate a direct link between neural population tuning and human cognition and show that high-level memory processing interacts with network-wide environmental coding in the service of behavior.",

    "abstract": "The spliceosome assembles on pre-mRNA in a stepwise manner through five successive pre-spliceosome complexes. The spliceosome functions to remove introns from pre-mRNAs to generate mature mRNAs that encode functional proteins. Many small molecule inhibitors of the spliceosome have been identified and they are cytotoxic. However, little is known about genetic determinants of cell sensitivity. Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is a transcription factor that can stimulate apoptotic cell death in response to a variety of cellular stresses. Here, we used a genetic approach to determine if ATF3 was important in determining the sensitivity of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to two splicing inhibitors: pladienolide B (PB) and isoginkgetin (IGG), that target different pre-spliceosome complexes. Both compounds led to increased ATF3 expression and apoptosis in control MEFs while ATF3 null cells were significantly protected from the cytotoxic effects of these drugs. Similarly, ATF3 was induced in response to IGG and PB in the two human tumour cell lines tested while knockdown of ATF3 protected cells from both drugs. Taken together, ATF3 appears to contribute to the cytotoxicity elicited by these spliceosome inhibitors in both murine and human cells.",

    "abstract": "Stress activates a complex network of hormones known as the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA axis is dysregulated in chronic stress and psychiatric disorders, but the origin of this dysregulation is unclear and cannot be explained by current HPA models. To address this, we developed a new mathematical model for the HPA axis that incorporates changes in the total functional mass of the HPA hormone-secreting glands. The mass changes are caused by the HPA hormones which act as growth factors for the glands in the axis. We find that the HPA axis shows the property of dynamical compensation, where gland masses adjust over weeks to buffer variation in physiological parameters. These mass changes explain the experimental findings on dysregulation of cortisol and ACTH dynamics in alcoholism, anorexia and postpartum. Dysregulation occurs for a wide range of parameters, and is exacerbated by impaired glucocorticoid receptor (GR) feedback, providing an explanation for the implication of GR in mood disorders. These findings suggest that gland-mass dynamics may play an important role in the pathophysiology of stress-related disorders.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe HPA axis is a neuroendocrine axis that is activated in response to stressors. The classical description of this axis includes three hormones that act in a cascade, with the final hormone cortisol inhibiting the two upstream hormones, ACTH and CRH. This classical picture has timescales of hours due to hormone half-lives, and cannot explain phenomena on the scale of weeks to months associated with this axis, such as the dysregulation observed in depression, alcohol addiction, postpartum, and other conditions. Here, we use a minimal-model approach to add to the classical model two known interactions in which CRH and ACTH not only regulate downstream hormones, but also act as growth factors for the cells that secrete these hormones. This creates a physiological circuit that can maintain total cell mass and buffer parameter changes. It has a fragility in which after prolonged stress, the total cell functional masses grow and take weeks to return to baseline. This is sufficient to explain the specific dynamics of hormone dysregulation found in several contexts. It also quantifies the effect of the cortisol (glucocorticoid) receptor on resilience to prolonged stress. Our findings suggest that interactions between hormones and cell functional mass may play an important role in HPA axis regulation on the timescale of weeks to months.\n\nSynopsis O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY\n\nThe HPA axis helps the body adapt to stress, but becomes dysregulated after prolonged activation, with clinical consequences. The origin of this dysregulation is unclear. We provide a mechanism for dysregulation based on the effect of the HPA hormones as growth factors for their downstream glands. O_LIA mathematical model that includes gland functional mass dynamics, introduces a new slow timescale of weeks to the HPA axis; previous models had only fast timescales of hours.\nC_LIO_LIThe gland masses grow during prolonged activation, providing dynamical compensation, and recover with overshoots over weeks after withdrawal of activation.\nC_LIO_LIThese overshoots are sufficient to explain the observed HPA dysregulation in pathological conditions, and clarify the role of glucocorticoid receptors in resilience to prolonged stress.\nC_LI",

Our method takes advantage of site-specific conservation and variant acceptability metrics that minimize previous classification limitations. Using our novel features, we deploy machine learning to predict the pathogenicity of thousands of human mtDNA variants.

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Till date, no vaccine or completely effective drug is available to cure COVID-19. Therefore, an effective vaccine against SARS-COV-2 is crucially needed. This study was conducted to design an effective multiepitope based vaccine (MEV) against SARS-COV-2. Seven antigenic proteins were taken as targets and different epitopes (B-cell, T-cell and IFN-{gamma} inducing) were predicted. Highly antigenic and overlapping epitopes were shortlisted. Selected epitopes indicated significant interactions with the HLA-binding alleles and 99.29% coverage of the worlds population. Finally, 505 amino acids long MEV was designed by connecting sixteen MHC class I and eleven MHC class II epitopes with suitable linkers and adjuvant. Linkers and adjuvant were added to enhance the immunogenicity response of the MEV. The antigenicity, allergenicity, physiochemical properties and structural details of MEV were analyzed in order to ensure safety and immunogenicity. MEV construct was non-allergenic, antigenic, stable and flexible. Molecular docking followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysis, demonstrated a stable and strong binding affinity of MEV with human pathogenic toll-like receptors (TLR), TLR3 and TLR8. Codon optimization and in silico cloning of MEV ensured increased expression in the Escherichia coli K-12 system. Designed MEV in present study could be a potential candidate for further vaccine production process against COVID-19. However, to ensure its safety and immunogenic profile, the proposed MEV needs to be experimentally validated.",

    "abstract": "Algorithms for active module identification (AMI) are central to analysis of omics data. Such algorithms receive a gene network and nodes activity scores as input and report sub-networks that show significant over-representation of accrued activity signal ( active modules), thus representing biological processes that presumably play key roles in the analyzed biological conditions. Although such methods exist for almost two decades, only a handful of studies attempted to compare the biological signals captured by different methods. Here, we systematically evaluated six popular AMI methods on gene expression (GE) and GWAS data. Notably, we observed that GO terms enriched in modules detected by these methods on the real data were often also enriched on modules found on randomly permuted input data. This indicated that AMI methods frequently report modules that are not specific to the biological context measured by the analyzed omics dataset. To tackle this bias, we designed a permutation-based method that evaluates the empirical significance of GO terms reported as enriched in modules. We used the method to fashion five novel performance criteria for evaluating AMI methods. Last, we developed DOMINO, a novel AMI algorithm, that outperformed the other six algorithms in extensive testing on GE and GWAS data. Software is available at https://github.com/Shamir-Lab.",

    "abstract": "O_LIMotion-activated wildlife cameras (or \"camera traps\") are frequently used to remotely and non-invasively observe animals. The vast number of images collected from camera trap projects have prompted some biologists to employ machine learning algorithms to automatically recognize species in these images, or at least filter-out images that do not contain animals. These approaches are often limited by model transferability, as a model trained to recognize species from one location might not work as well for the same species in different locations. Furthermore, these methods often require advanced computational skills, making them inaccessible to many biologists.\nC_LIO_LIWe used 3 million camera trap images from 18 studies in 10 states across the United States of America to train two deep neural networks, one that recognizes 58 species, the \"species model,\" and one that determines if an image is empty or if it contains an animal, the \"empty-animal model.\"\nC_LIO_LIOur species model and empty-animal model had accuracies of 96.8% and 97.3%, respectively. Furthermore, the models performed well on some out-of-sample datasets, as the species model had 91% accuracy on species from Canada (accuracy range 36-91% across all out-of-sample datasets) and the empty-animal model achieved an accuracy of 91-94% on out-of-sample datasets from different continents.\nC_LIO_LIOur software addresses some of the limitations of using machine learning to classify images from camera traps. By including many species from several locations, our species model is potentially applicable to many camera trap studies in North America. We also found that our empty-animal model can facilitate removal of images without animals globally.

    "abstract": "Interferon (IFN) family cytokines stimulate genes (ISGs) that are integral to antiviral host defense. Type I IFNs act systemically whereas type III IFNs act preferentially at epithelial barriers. Among barrier cells, intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are particularly dependent on type III IFN for control and clearance of virus infection, but the physiological basis of this selective IFN response is not well understood. Here, we confirm that type III IFN treatment elicits robust and uniform ISG expression in neonatal mouse IECs and inhibits replication of IEC-tropic rotavirus. In contrast, type I IFN elicits a marginal ISG response in neonatal mouse IECs and does not inhibit rotavirus replication. In vitro treatment of IEC organoids with type III IFN results in ISG expression that mirrors the in vivo type III IFN response. However, the response of IEC organoids to type I IFN is strikingly increased relative to type III IFN in magnitude and scope. The expanded type I IFN-specific response includes pro-apoptotic genes and potentiates toxicity triggered by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF). The ISGs stimulated in common by types I and III IFN have strong interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) promoter motifs, whereas the expanded set of type I IFN-specific ISGs, including pro-apoptotic genes, have weak ISRE motifs. Thus, preferential responsiveness of IECs to type III IFN in vivo enables selective ISG expression during infection that confers antiviral protection but minimizes disruption of intestinal homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "We study the structural ensembles of human chromosomes across different cell types. Using computer simulations, we generate cell-specific 3D chromosomal structures and compare them to recently published chromatin structures obtained through microscopy. We demonstrate using a combination of machine learning and polymer physics simulations that epigenetic information can be used to predict the structural ensembles of multiple human cell lines. The chromosomal structures obtained in silico are quantitatively consistent with those obtained through microscopy as well as DNA-DNA proximity ligation assays. Theory predicts that chromosome structures are fluid and can only be described by an ensemble, which is consistent with the observation that chromosomes exhibit no unique fold. Nevertheless, our analysis of both structures from simulation and microscopy reveals that short segments of chromatin make transitions between a closed conformation and an open dumbbell conformation. This conformational transition appears to be consistent with a two-state process with an effective free energy cost of about four times the effective information theoretic temperature. Finally, we study the conformational changes associated with the switching of genomic compartments observed in human cell lines. Genetically identical but epigenetically distinct cell types appear to rearrange their respective structural ensembles to expose segments of transcriptionally active chromatin, belonging to the A genomic compartment, towards the surface of the chromosome, while inactive segments, belonging to the B compartment, move to the interior. The formation of genomic compartments resembles hydrophobic collapse in protein folding, with the aggregation of denser and predominantly inactive chromatin driving the positioning of active chromatin toward the surface of individual chromosomal territories.",

Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) is a known key mediator of physiological bone regeneration and is clinically approved for selected musculoskeletal interventions. Yet, broad usage of this growth factor is impeded due to side effects that are majorly evoked by high dosages and burst release kinetics.\n\nIn this study, mesoporous bioactive glass microspheres (MBGs) produced by an aerosol assisted spray-drying, scalable process were found to be biocompatible and to induce a pro-osteogenic response on human MSCs in vitro. Loading of the MBGs with BMP-2 resulted in prolonged, low-dose BMP-2 release without affecting the material features. In a pre-clinical rodent model, BMP-2 loaded MBGs significantly enhanced bone formation and influenced the microarchitecture of newly formed bone. The MBG carriers alone performed equal to the untreated (empty) control in most parameters tested, while additionally exerting mild pro-angiogenic effects.\n\nUsing MBGs as a biocompatible, pro-regenerative carrier for local and sustained low dose BMP-2 release could limit side effects, thus enabling a safer usage of BMP-2 as a potent pro-osteogenic growth factor.",

    "abstract": "The LINC complex mechanically couples cytoskeletal and nuclear components across the nuclear envelope to fulfil a myriad of cellular functions, including nuclear shape and positioning, hearing and meiotic chromosome movements. The canonical model of the LINC complex is of individual linear nucleocytoskeletal linkages provided by 3:3 interactions between SUN and KASH proteins. Here, we provide crystallographic and biophysical evidence that SUN-KASH is a constitutive 6:6 complex in which two SUN trimers interact back-to-back. A common SUN-KASH topology is achieved through structurally diverse 6:6 interaction mechanisms by distinct KASH proteins, including zinc-coordination by Nesprin-4. The SUN-KASH 6:6 complex is incompatible with the current model of a linear LINC complex and instead suggests the formation of a branched LINC complex network. In this model, SUN-KASH 6:6 complexes act as nodes for force distribution and integration between adjacent SUN and KASH molecules, enabling the coordinated transduction of large forces across the nuclear envelope.",

    "abstract": "Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) is a protein deacylase enzyme that removes acetyl groups and longer chain acyl groups from post-translationally modified lysine residues. It affects diverse biological functions in the cell and has been considered a drug target in relation to both neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Therefore, access to well-characterized and robust tool compounds is essential for the continued investigation of the complex functions of this enzyme. Here, we report a collection of probes that are potent, selective, stable in serum, water-soluble, amenable to cell culture experiments, and inhibit both SIRT2 deacetylation and demyristoylation. Compared to the current landscape of SIRT2 inhibitors, this is a unique ensemble of features built into a single compound. We expect the developed chemotypes to find broad application in the interrogation of SIRT2 functions in both healthy and diseased cells, and to provide a foundation for the development of future therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTIt is recently suggested that amyloid polymorphism, i.e., structural diversity of amyloid fibrils, has a deep relationship with pathology. However, its prompt recognition is almost halted due to insufficiency of analytical methods for detecting polymorphism of amyloid fibrils sensitively and quickly. Here, we propose that iodine staining, a historically known reaction that was firstly found by Virchow, can be used as a method for distinguishing amyloid polymorphs. When insulin fibrils were prepared and iodine-stained, they exhibited different colors depending on polymorphs. Each of the colors was inherited to daughter fibrils by seeding reactions. The colors were fundamentally represented as a sum of three absorption bands in visible region between 400-750 nm, and the bands showed different titration curves against iodine, suggesting that there are three specific iodine binding sites. The analysis of resonance Raman spectra and polarization microscope suggested that several polyiodide ions composed of I3\u2212 and/or I5\u2212 were formed on the grooves or the edges of \u03b2-sheets. It was concluded that the polyiodide species and conformations formed are sensitive to surface structure of amyloid fibrils, and the resultant differences in color will be useful for detecting polymorphism in a wide range of diagnostic samples.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Acinetobacter baumannii poses a great threat in healthcare settings worldwide with clinical isolates revealing an ever evolving multidrug-resistance. Here, we report the molecular mechanisms governing the tight repression of the error-prone DNA polymerase umuDC genes in this important bacterial human pathogen. We demonstrate that the small DdrR protein directly interacts with the UmuDAb transcription repressor, which possesses some similarities to LexA proteins from other bacteria, to increase the repressors affinity for target sequences in the umuDC operon. These data reveal that DdrR forms a stable complex with free UmuDAb but is released upon association of this repressor complex with target DNA. We show that DdrR also interacts with UmuD, a component of DNA polymerase V and that DdrR enhances the operator binding of LexA repressors from Clostridium difficile, Bacillus thuringiensis and Staphylococcus aureus. Our results suggest that proteins that assist the action of LexA-like transcription factors may be common to many, if not all, bacteria that mount the SOS response.",

We used DNA metabarcoding to study the diets of forest-dwelling insectivorous bat species, and compared bat-prey interaction networks between old growth forest and forest degraded by logging in Sabah, Borneo.\nC_LIO_LIWe predicted that rainforest degradation would cause measurable reductions in the numbers of prey consumed by individual bats, and that this degradation would yield networks in logged forest with lower functional complementarity, modularity and nestedness than those in old growth forest.\nC_LIO_LICompared to bats in old growth rainforest, bats in logged sites consumed a lower diversity of prey. Their interaction networks were less nested and had a more modular structure in which bat species had lower closeness centrality scores than in old growth forest. These network structures were associated with reduced network redundancy and thus increased vulnerability to perturbations in logged forests.\nC_LIO_LIOur results show how ecological interactions change between old growth and logged forests, with potentially negative implications for ecosystem function and network stability.

    "abstract": "Goal-directed behavior requires integrating sensory information with prior knowledge about the environment. Behavioral biases that arise from these priors could increase positive outcomes when the priors match the true structure of the environment, but mismatches also happen frequently and could cause unfavorable outcomes. Biases that reduce gains and fail to vanish with training indicate fundamental suboptimalities arising from ingrained heuristics of the brain. Here, we report systematic, gain-reducing choice biases in highly-trained monkeys performing a motion direction discrimination task where only the current stimulus is behaviorally relevant. The monkeys bias fluctuated at two distinct time scales: slow, spanning tens to hundreds of trials, and fast, arising from choices and outcomes of the most recent trials. Our finding enabled single trial prediction of biases, which influenced the choice especially on trials with weak stimuli. The pre-stimulus activity of neuronal ensembles in the monkey prearcuate gyrus represented these biases as an offset along the decision axis in the state space. This offset persisted throughout the stimulus viewing period, when sensory information was integrated, leading to a biased choice. The pre-stimulus representation of history-dependent bias was functionally indistinguishable from the neural representation of upcoming choice before stimulus onset, validating our model of single-trial biases and suggesting that pre-stimulus representation of choice could be fully defined by biases inferred from behavioral history. Our results indicate that the prearcuate gyrus reflects intrinsic heuristics that compute bias signals, as well as the mechanisms that integrate them into the oculomotor decision-making process.",

Although the majority of B cell repertoire studies incorporate some aspect of antibody evolution, how the chosen computational methods affect the results is largely ignored. Therefore, we performed an extensive computational analysis on time-resolved antibody repertoire sequencing data to better characterize how commonly employed bioinformatic practices influence conclusions regarding antibody selection and evolution.

This juvenilization of blood properties represents a canalization of an acclimatization response to hypoxia that has been well-documented in adult goats and sheep.

To address this challenge, we developed a high-throughput functional genomics approach combining inducible CRISPR-interference and image-based analyses of morphological features and sub-cellular molecular localizations in the related non-pathogen, M. smegmatis. Applying automated imaging and analysis to an arrayed library of 272 essential gene knockdown mutants, we derive robust, quantitative descriptions of bacillary morphologies consequent on gene silencing. Leveraging statistical-learning, we demonstrate that functionally related genes cluster by morphotypic similarity and that this information can be used to infer gene function. Exploiting this observation, we reveal a previously unknown restriction-modification system, and identify filamentation as a defining mycobacterial response to histidine starvation.

Current reconstruction techniques are based on a marginalized maximum-likelihood formulation that requires calculations over the set of all possible poses for each projection image, a computationally demanding procedure. CryoGAN sidesteps this problem by using a generative adversarial network (GAN) to learn the 3D structure that has simulated projections that most closely match the real data in a distributional sense. The architecture of CryoGAN resembles that of standard GAN, with the twist that the generator network is replaced by a model of the cryo-EM image acquisition process. CryoGAN is an unsupervised algorithm that only demands projection images and an estimate of the contrast transfer function parameters. No initial volume estimate or prior training is needed. Moreover, CryoGAN requires minimal user interaction and can provide reconstructions in a matter of hours on a high-end GPU. In addition, we provide sound mathematical guarantees on the recovery of the correct structure. CryoGAN currently achieves a 8.6 [A] resolution on a realistic synthetic dataset. Preliminary results on real {beta}-galactosidase data demonstrate CryoGANs ability to exploit data statistics under standard experimental imaging conditions. We believe that this paradigm opens the door to a family of novel likelihood-free algorithms for cryo-EM reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Neuroscientific data analysis has traditionally relied on linear algebra and stochastic process theory. However, the tree-like shapes of neurons cannot be described easily as points in a vector space (the subtraction of two neuronal shapes is not a meaningful operation), and methods from computational topology are better suited to their analysis. Here we introduce methods from Discrete Morse (DM) Theory to extract the tree-skeletons of individual neurons from volumetric brain image data, and to summarize collections of neurons labelled by tracer injections. Since individual neurons are topologically trees, it is sensible to summarize the collection of neurons using a consensus tree-shape that provides a richer information summary than the traditional regional  connectivity matrix approach. The conceptually elegant DM approach lacks hand-tuned parameters and captures global properties of the data as opposed to previous approaches which are inherently local. For individual skeletonization of sparsely labelled neurons we obtain substantial performance gains over state-of-the-art non-topological methods (over 10% improvements in precision and faster proofreading). The consensus-tree summary of tracer injections incorporates the regional connectivity matrix information, but in addition captures the collective collateral branching patterns of the set of neurons connected to the injection site, and provides a bridge between single-neuron morphology and tracer-injection data.",

    "abstract": "Cortical parallel processing streams segregate many diverse features of a sensory scene. However, some features are distributed across streams, begging the question of whether and how such distributed representations contribute to perception. We determined the necessity of primary visual cortex (V1) and three key higher visual areas (LM, AL and PM) for perception of orientation and contrast, two features that are robustly encoded across all four areas. Suppressing V1, LM or AL decreased sensitivity for both orientation discrimination and contrast detection, consistent with a role for these areas in sensory perception. In comparison, suppressing PM selectively increased false alarm rates during contrast detection, without any effect on orientation discrimination. This effect was not retinotopically-specific, suggesting a distinct role for PM in the regulation of noise during decision-making. Thus, we find that distributed representations in the visual system can nonetheless support specialized perceptual roles for higher visual cortical areas.",

    "abstract": "Color, an important visual cue for survival, is encoded by comparing signals from photoreceptors with different spectral sensitivities. The mouse retina expresses a short wavelength-sensitive and a middle/long wavelength-sensitive opsin (S- and M-opsin), forming opposing, overlapping gradients along the dorsal-ventral axis. Here, we analyzed the distribution of all cone types across the entire retina for two commonly used mouse strains. We found, unexpectedly, that  true S-cones (S-opsin only) are highly concentrated (up to 30% of cones) in ventral retina. Moreover, S-cone bipolar cells (SCBCs) are also skewed towards ventral retina, with wiring patterns matching the distribution of true S-cones. In addition, true S-cones in the ventral retina form clusters, which may augment synaptic input to SCBCs. Such a unique true S-cone pattern forms a basis for mouse color vision, likely reflecting evolutionary adaption to enhance color coding for the upper visual field suitable for mices habitat and behavior.",

It is validated for use with ThinPrep-PreservCyt (Hologic, Marlborough, MA) transport medium which has a high methanol content and is therefore classified as a dangerous good for shipping; making cost, transportation and use challenging within LMIC. Therefore, we compared the performance of ThinPrep against four non-volatile commercially available media for HPV point-of-care testing.\n\nMethodsTen-fold serial dilutions were prepared using three HPV cell lines each positive for 16, 18 or 31 and with each suspended in five different media types. The media types consisted of Phosphate Buffered Saline (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), Sigma Virocult (Medical Wire & Equipment, Wiltshire, England), MSwab (Copan, Brescia BS, Italy) Xpert Transport Media (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, USA) and ThinPrep-PreservCyt (Hologic Inc., Marlborough, MA).\n\nResultsA total of 105 HPV Xpert tests were conducted in a laboratory setting, with 7 ten-fold dilutions of each of the 3 HPV genotypes tested in all 5 media types. The lowest HPV ten-fold dilution detected for any media, or cell line was the fifth dilution. Mswab was the only media to detect HPV to the 5th dilution across all three cell types.\n\nDiscussionMswab transport media may be a suitable alternative to ThinPrep for Xpert HPV point of care testing and increase HPV detection. A field-based, head to head comparison of both media types using the Xpert HPV assay is warranted to confirm these laboratory-based findings.",

Understanding the origins of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for deterring future zoonosis and for drug discovery and vaccine development. We show evidence of strong purifying selection around the receptor binding motif (RBM) in the spike gene and in other genes among bat, pangolin and human coronaviruses, indicating similar strong evolutionary constraints in different host species. We also demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2s entire RBM was introduced through recombination with coronaviruses from pangolins, possibly a critical step in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2s ability to infect humans. Similar purifying selection in different host species and frequent recombination among coronaviruses suggest a common evolutionary mechanism that could lead to new emerging human coronaviruses.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryExtensive Recombination and Strong Purifying Selection among coronaviruses from different hosts facilitate the emergence of SARS-CoV-2",

Modification of NEDD8 onto substrates is finely balanced by the co-ordinated activity of conjugating and deconjugating enzymes. The NEDP1/DEN1/SENP8 protease is a NEDD8 specific processing and deconjugating enzyme that regulates the NEDDylation mainly of non-cullin substrates. Here, we report the development and characterisation of nanobodies as first-in-class inhibitors for NEDP1. The nanobodies display high-affinity (low nM) against NEDP1 and specifically inhibit NEDP1 processing activity in vitro and NEDP1 deconjugating activity in tissue-culture cells and in cell extracts. We also isolated nanobodies that bind to NEDP1 with high-affinity but do not affect NEDP1 activity. The developed nanobodies provide new tools to study the function of NEDP1 and to prevent deNEDDylation in cell extracts used in biochemical assays.",

We recently described APOBEC3A-mediated cytosine-to-uracil (C>U) RNA editing during M1 polarization. However, the functional significance of this editing is unknown. Here, we find that APOBEC3A-mediated cellular RNA editing can also be induced by influenza or Maraba virus infections of normal human macrophages, and by interferons in tumor-associated macrophages. Gene knockdown and RNA_Seq analyses show that APOBEC3A mediates C>U RNA editing of 209 exonic/UTR sites in 203 genes during M1 polarization. The highest level of deleterious C>U RNA editing occurred in THOC5, encoding a nuclear mRNA export protein implicated in M-CSF-driven macrophage differentiation. Knockdown of APOBEC3A reduces pro-inflammatory M1 markers including IL6, IL23A and IL12B gene expression, CD86 surface protein expression, and TNF-, IL-1{beta} and IL-6 cytokine secretion, and increases glycolysis and glycolytic capacity. Thus, APOBEC3A cytidine deaminase plays an important role in transcriptomic and functional polarization of M1 macrophages.",

There are currently no antiviral drugs with proven efficacy nor are there vaccines for its prevention. Unfortunately, the scientific community has little knowledge of the molecular details of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To illuminate this, we cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the 29 viral proteins in human cells and identified the human proteins physically associated with each using affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), which identified 332 high confidence SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Among these, we identify 66 druggable human proteins or host factors targeted by 69 existing FDA-approved drugs, drugs in clinical trials and/or preclinical compounds, that we are currently evaluating for efficacy in live SARS-CoV-2 infection assays. The identification of host dependency factors mediating virus infection may provide key insights into effective molecular targets for developing broadly acting antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and other deadly coronavirus strains.",
