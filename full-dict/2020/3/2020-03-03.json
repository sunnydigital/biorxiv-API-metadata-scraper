    "abstract": "Present approaches to assess cancer treatments are often inaccurate, costly, and/or cumbersome. Functional testing platforms that use live tumor cells are a promising tool both for drug development and for identifying the optimal therapy for a given patient, i.e. precision oncology. However, current methods that utilize patient-derived cells from dissociated tissue typically lack the microenvironment of the tumor tissue and/or cannot inform on a timescale rapid enough to guide decisions for patient-specific therapy. We have developed a microfluidic platform that allows for multiplexed drug testing of intact tumor slices cultured on a porous membrane. The device is digitally-manufactured in a biocompatible thermoplastic by laser-cutting and solvent bonding. Here we describe the fabrication process in detail, we characterize the fluidic performance of the device, and demonstrate on-device drug-response testing with tumor slices from xenografts and from a patient colorectal tumor.",

    "abstract": "Through the analysis of linkage disequilibrium from genome-wide sequencing data for multiple individuals from eight populations, the general features of the recombinational landscape are revealed in the microcrustacean Daphnia pulex. The data suggest an exceptionally uniform pattern of recombination across the genome, while also confirming general patterns that are inconsistent with existing population-genetic models for the relationship between linkage dis-equilibrium and physical distances between genomic sites. Patterns of linkage disequilibrium are highly consistent among populations, and average rates of recombination are quite similar for all chromosomes. There is no evidence of recombination hotspots, and although there does appear to be suppressed recombination in the vicinity of gene bodies, this effect is quite small. Although this species reproduces asexually in [~] 80% of generations, the mean per-generation recombination rate per nucleotide site is [~] 37x the per-nucleotide mutation rate. Contrary to expectations for models in which crossing-over is the primary mechanism of recombination, and consistent with data for other species, the gradient of linkage disequilibrium with increasing physical distance between sites is far too high at short distances and far too low at long distances, suggesting an important role for factors such as the nonindependent appearance of pairs of mutations on haplotypes and long-range gene-conversion-like processes. Combined with other observations on patterns of nucleotide variation, these results provide a strong case for the utility of D. pulex as a model system for the study of mechanisms of evolution in natural populations.",

    "abstract": "Stem cells, with their capacity to self-renew and to differentiate to more specialized cell types, play a key role to maintain homeostasis in adult tissues. To investigate how, in the dynamic stochastic environment of a tissue, non-genetic diversity and the precise balance between proliferation and differentiation are achieved, it is necessary to understand the molecular mechanisms of the stem cells in decision making process. By focusing on the impact of stochasticity, we proposed a computational model describing the regulatory circuitry as a tri-stable dynamical system to reveal the mechanism which orchestrate this balance. Our model explains how the distribution of noise in genes, linked to the cell regulatory networks, controls cell decision-making to maintain homeostatic state. The noise control over tissue homeostasis is achieved by regulating the probability of differentiation and self-renewal through symmetric and/or asymmetric cell divisions. Our model reveals, when mutations due to the replication of DNA in stem cell division, are inevitable, how mutations contribute to either aging gradually or the development of cancer in a short period of time. Furthermore, our model sheds some light on the impact of more complex regulatory networks on the system robustness against perturbations.",

However, with the growing availability of genome editing and functional genomic tools, complex behavioral traits such as social behavior can now be explored in diverse organisms. Here we present a minimally invasive neurosurgical procedure for a classic behavioral, ecological and evolutionary system: threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). This method of direct brain injection enables viral-mediated transgenesis and pharmaceutical delivery which bypasses the blood-brain barrier. This method is flexible, fast, and amenable to statistically powerful within-subject experimental designs, making it well-suited for use in genetically diverse animals such as those collected from natural populations.\n\nViral-mediated transgenesis in the brain allows for a direct examination of the genetic mechanisms underlying behavior in wild-caught animals from natural populations. Using this method, we were able to detect changes in aggression from the knockdown of either of two different genes, arginine vasopressin (AVP) and monoamine oxidase (MAOA), in outbred animals in less than one month. In addition, we demonstrate that widely available mammalian plasmids work with this method, lowering the barrier of entry to the technique.",

    "abstract": "Nonsense mediated RNA decay (NMD) is an evolutionary conserved RNA control mechanism that has also been implicated in the broader regulation of gene expression. Nevertheless, a role for NMD in genome regulation has not been fully assessed, partially because NMD inactivation is lethal in many organisms. Here, we performed in depth comparative analysis of Arabidopsis mutants lacking key proteins involved in different steps of NMD. We observed that UPF3, UPF1, and SMG7 have different impacts on NMD and the Arabidopsis transcriptome, with UPF1 having the biggest effect. Transcriptome assembly using stringent pipeline in UPF1-null plants revealed genome wide changes in alternative splicing, including switches in mRNA variants, suggesting a role for UPF1 in splicing. We further found that UPF1 inactivation leads to translational repression, manifested by a global shift in mRNAs from polysomes to monosomes and a downregulation of genes involved in translation and ribosome biogenesis. Despite this global change, NMD targets and low-expressed mRNAs with short half-lives were enriched in polysomes, indicating that UPF1 specifically suppresses the translation of aberrant RNAs. Particularly striking was an increase in the translation of TIR domain-containing, nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat (TNL) immune receptors. The regulation of TNLs via UPF1/NMD-mediated mRNA stability and translational de-repression offers a dynamic mechanism for the rapid activation of TNLs in response to pathogen attack.",

    "abstract": "Control of gene expression in kinetoplastids depends heavily on RNA-binding proteins that influence mRNA decay and translation. We previously showed that MKT1 interacts with PBP1, which in turn recruits LSM12 and poly(A) binding protein. MKT1 is recruited to mRNA by sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins, resulting in stabilisation of mRNA. We here show that PBP1, LSM12 and an additional 117-residue protein, XAC1 (Tb927.7.2780), are present in complexes that contain either MKT1 or MKT1L (Tb927.10.1490). All five proteins are present predominantly in the complexes, and there was evidence for a minor subset of complexes that contained both MKT1 and MKT1L. MKT1 appeared to be associated with many mRNAs, with the exception of those encoding ribosomal proteins. XAC1-containing complexes reproducibly contained RNA-binding proteins that were previously found associated with MKT1. In addition, however, XAC1- or MKT1-containing complexes specifically recruit one of the six translation initiation complexes, EIF4E6-EIF4G5; and yeast 2-hybrid assay results indicated that MKT1 interacts with EIF4G5. The C-terminus of MKT1L resembles MKT1: it contains MKT1 domains and a PIN domain that is probably not active as an endonuclease. MKT1L, however, also has an N-terminal extension with regions of low-complexity. Although MKT1L depletion inhibited cell proliferation, we found no evidence for specific interactions with RNA-binding proteins or mRNA. Deletion of the N-terminal extension, however, enabled MKT1L to interact with EIF4E6. We speculate that MKT1L may either enhance or inhibit the functions of MKT1-containing complexes.",

Here, we show that hepatocyte-specific ablation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-associated Gdown1 leads to down-regulation of highly expressed genes involved in plasma protein synthesis and metabolism, a concomitant cell cycle re-entry associated with induction of cell cycle-related genes (including cyclin D1). and up-regulation of p21 through activation of p53 signaling. In the absence of p53, Gdown1-deficient hepatocytes show a severe dysregulation of cell cycle progression, with incomplete mitoses, and a pre-malignant-like transformation. Mechanistically, Gdown1 is associated with elongating Pol II on the highly expressed genes and its ablation leads to reduced Pol II recruitment to these genes, suggesting that Pol II redistribution may facilitate hepatocyte re-entry into the cell cycle. These results establish an important physiological function for a Pol II regulatory factor (Gdown1) in the maintenance of normal liver cell transcription through constraints on cell cycle re-entry of quiescent hepatocytes.",

Cluster stability was assessed via bootstrapping approach. Cluster probability did not indicate distinct/clear clustering. However, when participants were plotted in a dimensionally reduced  similarity space derived from bootstrapping, variability in brain activity among participants was best represented multidimensionally.

    "abstract": "During infection, cellular resources are allocated toward the metabolically-demanding processes of synthesizing and secreting effector proteins that neutralize and kill invading pathogens. In Drosophila, these effectors are antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that are produced in the fat body, an organ that also serves as a major lipid storage depot. Here we asked how activation of Toll signaling in the larval fat body perturbs lipid homeostasis to understand how cells meet the metabolic demands of the immune response. We find that genetic activation of fat body Toll signaling leads to a tissue-autonomous reduction in triglyceride storage that is paralleled by decreased transcript levels of Lipin, which synthesizes diacylglycerol, and midway, which carries out the final step of triglyceride synthesis. In contrast, we discovered that Kennedy pathway enzymes, such as easily shocked and Pcyt1, that synthesize membrane phospholipids are induced by the Toll pathway. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed elevated levels of major phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine species in fat bodies with active Toll signaling. The induction of Kennedy pathway enzymes in response to Toll signaling required the unfolded response mediator Xbp1 but was blunted by deleting AMP genes and thereby reducing secretory demand elicited by Toll activation. Consistent with these findings, endoplasmic reticulum volume is expanded in fat body cells with active Toll signaling, as determined by transmission electron microscopy. Our results establish that Toll signaling induces a shift in anabolic lipid metabolism, accompanied by changes in key lipid synthesis enzymes, that may serve the immediate demand for AMP synthesis and secretion but that ultimately leads to the long-term consequence of insufficient nutrient storage.\n\nAuthor summaryFighting infection requires that immune cells synthesize antimicrobial peptides and antibodies and carry out cellular processes like phagocytosis to destroy microbes and clear infected cells. During infection, metabolic processes support and direct immune function. Here, we use the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model system to understand the interaction between immunity and metabolism. In Drosophila larvae, infection leads to tremendous production of antimicrobial peptides that destroy invading microbes. These peptides are made in the fat body, an organ that is also the site of fat storage. Activating the immune response reduces lipid storage but increases the production of phospholipids that form the membranes of organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum. This organelle is the starting point for synthesis and secretion of antimicrobial peptides, and its volume is increased in response to immune activation. Shifting metabolism from fat storage to membrane phospholipid synthesis supports the immune response. However, this comes at the expense of the ability to withstand other types of stress such as food scarcity. These findings are important because they suggest that some of the metabolic changes induced by fighting infection may become pathological if they are maintained over long periods of time.",

    "abstract": "Transcription termination has important regulatory functions, impacting mRNA stability, localization and translation potential. Failure to appropriately terminate transcription can also lead to read-through transcription and the synthesis of antisense RNAs which can have profound impact on gene expression. The Transcription-Export (THO/TREX) protein complex plays an important role in coupling transcription with splicing and export of mRNA. However, little is known about the role of the THO/TREX complex in the control of transcription termination. In this work, we show that two proteins of the THO/TREX complex, namely TREX COMPONENT 1 (TEX1 or THO3) and HYPER RECOMBINATION1 (HPR1 or THO1) contribute to the correct transcription termination at several loci in Arabidopsis thaliana. We first demonstrate this by showing defective termination in tex1 and hpr1 mutants at the nopaline synthase (NOS) terminator present in a T-DNA inserted between exon 1 and 3 of the PHO1 locus in the pho1-7 mutant. Read-through transcription beyond the NOS terminator and splicing-out of the T-DNA resulted in the generation of a near full-length PHO1 mRNA (minus exon 2) in the tex1 pho1-7 and hpr1 pho1-7 double mutants, with enhanced production of a truncated PHO1 protein that retained phosphate export activity. Consequently, the strong reduction of shoot growth associated with the severe phosphate deficiency of the pho1-7 mutant was alleviated in the tex1 pho1-7 and hpr1 pho1-7 double mutants. Additionally, we show that RNA termination defects in tex1 and hpr1 mutants leads to 3UTR extensions in several plant genes. These results demonstrate that THO/TREX complex contributes to the regulation of transcription termination.\n\nAuthor summaryProduction of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) involves numerous steps including initiation of transcription, elongation, splicing, termination, as well as export out of the nucleus. All these steps are highly coordinated and failure in any steps has a profound impact on the level and identity of mRNAs produced. The THO/TREX protein complex is associated with nascent RNAs and contributes to several mRNA biogenesis steps, including splicing and export. However, the contribution of the THO/TREX complex to mRNA termination was poorly defined. We have identified a role for two components of the THO/TREX complex, namely the proteins TEX1 and HPR1, in the control of transcription termination in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that the tex1 and hpr1 mutants have defects in terminating mRNA at the nopaline synthase (NOS) terminator found in T-DNA insertion mutants leading to the transcriptional read-through pass the NOS terminator. We also show that tex1 and hpr1 mutants have defects in mRNA termination at several endogenous genes, leading to the production of 3UTR extensions. Together, these results highlight a role for the THO/TREX complex in mRNA termination.",

    "abstract": "Cell spreading provides one of the simplest configurations in which eukaryotic cells develop angular symmetry-breaking assemblies of mechanosensing and mechanotransducive organelles in preparation for cell differentiation and movement. By identifying the edge of the cell-ECM adhesion area as having an important role in mechanosensor complex aggregation, we consider the spatial patterns arising on this edge, within a 1D lattice model of the nearest-neighbour interaction between individual integrin-mediated mechanosensors. We obtain the Ginzburg-Landau free energy for this model and analyse the spectrum of spatial modes as the cell spreads and increases the contact area. We test the plausibility of our model by comparing its predictions for the azimuthal angular frequency of aggregation of mechanosensors into nascent focal adhesions (FAs) to observations of the paxillin distribution in spreading fibroblasts.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEThe topic of cell adhesion on substrates is very active, with numerous theoretical, experimental and computer simulation studies probing the mechanisms and signalling pathways of cell response to interacting with substrate. Integrin-based adhesion complexes are known to be the individual units of this process, and their dense aggregation into focal adhesions leads to cells developing asymmetry, polarity, and eventually - locomotion. Here we develop a theoretical model that suggests that physical interactions between individual adhesion complexes is the factor that defines the initial breaking of symmetry of the cell spreading on substrate, and predicts the characteristic wavelength of modulation above the critical size of adhesion area.",

Aflatoxins are among the most dangerous natural carcinogens, and regularly contaminate reserves of staple crops worldwide. Decontamination of aflatoxin-polluted food is of great interest for ensuring food safety, and bioremediation is regarded as the most promising solution. The fungal isoforms of laccase display the rare potential to detoxify aflatoxin by tackling its aromatic moieties.. Yet, because of a generally low efficiency, large-scale application of naturally occurring isoforms has so far been unfeasible. We perform a combination of quantitative experimentation and quantum mechanical modeling on aflatoxin and reveal that: (1) detoxification efficiency is limited by the low enzymatic affinity for the substrate; and (2) aflatoxin is not detoxified by oxidative activity of laccase alone, but requires additional stimulation from the environment. QM modeling also allowed identification of the residues in the laccase tertiary structure that determine affinity of the enzymatic pocket for aflatoxin. We conclude that, for our case-study, a full QM approach is mandatory as a first step towards rational optimization. We detail a feasible approach towards this endeavor and argue that our full QM characterization can serve as a roadmap for enzyme development in other applications pertaining laccase as well as other enzymes.",

    "abstract": "Microbial solar cells that mainly rely on the use of photosynthesic organisms are a promising alternative to photovoltaics for solar electricity production. In that way, we propose a new approach involving electrochemistry and fluorescence techniques. The coupled set-up Electro-Pulse-Amplitude-Modulation (\"e-PAM\") enables the simultaneous recording of the produced photocurrent and fluorescence signals from the photosynthetic chain. This methodology was validated with a suspension of green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in interaction with an exogenous redox mediatior (2,6-dichlorobenzoquinone; DCBQ). The balance between photosynthetic chain events (PSII photochemical yield, quenching) and the extracted electricity can be monitored overtime. More particularly, the non photochemical quenching induced by DCBQ mirrors the photocurrent. This set-up thus helps to distinguish the electron harvesting from some side effects due to quinones in real time. It therefore paves the way for future analyses devoted to the choice of the experimental conditions (redox mediator, photosynthetic organisms...) to find the best electron extraction.",

Due to its versatility the aim is to boost creativity and non-conventional approaches. In this paper, we demonstrate a development cycle from basic blocks to different microscopic techniques. First, we build a bright-field system and stress-test it by observing macrophage cell differentiation, apoptosis and proliferation incubator-enclosed for seven days with automatic focussing to minimize axial drift. We prove versatility by assembling a system using the same components to a fully working fluorescence light-sheet system and acquire a 3D volume of a GFP-expressing living drosophila larvae. Finally, we sketch and demonstrate further possible setups to draw a picture on how the system can be used for reproducible prototyping in scientific research. All design files for replicating the experimental setups are provided via an open-access online repository (https://github.com/bionanoimaging/UC2-GIT) to foster widespread use.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in human metabolic genes can lead to rare diseases known as inborn errors of human metabolism. For instance, patients with loss-of-function mutations in either subunit of propionyl-CoA carboxylase suffer from propionic acidemia because they cannot catabolize propionate, leading to its harmful accumulation. Interestingly, both the penetrance and expressivity of metabolic disorders can be modulated by genetic background. However, modifiers of these diseases are difficult to identify because of the lack of statistical power for rare diseases in human genetics. Here, we use a model of propionic acidemia in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to identify genetic modifiers of propionate sensitivity. By genome-wide association mapping across wild strains exposed to excess propionate we identify several genomic regions correlated with reduced propionate sensitivity. We find that natural variation in the putative glucuronosyltransferase GLCT-3, a homolog of human B3GAT, partly explains differences in propionate sensitivity in one of these genomic intervals. Using genome-editing, we demonstrate that loss-of-function alleles in glct-3 render the animals less sensitive to propionate. Additionally, we find that C. elegans has an expansion of the glct gene family, suggesting that the number of members of this family could influence sensitivity to excess propionate. Our findings demonstrate that natural variation in metabolic genes that are not directly associated with propionate breakdown can modulate propionate sensitivity. Our study provides a framework for using C. elegans to characterize the contributions of genetic background to inborn errors in human metabolism.",

    "abstract": "The metaxins were originally identified as vertebrate proteins of the outer mitochondrial membrane involved in protein import into mitochondria. Metaxin proteins have also been found in diverse invertebrate phyla. The present study is concerned with examining whether metaxin-like proteins occur in plants and bacteria. Metaxin-like proteins were revealed by their homology with human metaxins and the possession of characteristic GST_Metaxin protein domains. The results demonstrate that metaxin-like proteins exist in plants that include a wide variety of angiosperms, both eudicots and monocots, and other plant groups. Metaxin-like proteins can also be detected in bacteria, particularly in the Proteobacteria phylum, but also in different bacterial phyla. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that plant metaxin-like proteins, bacterial metaxin-like proteins, and vertebrate metaxins form distinct phylogenetic groups, but are related. Metaxin-like proteins, however, are only distantly related to GSTs (glutathione S-transferase proteins). A similar degree of homology is found in aligning the amino acid sequences of plant and bacterial metaxin-like proteins with human metaxins 1, 2, and 3 and other vertebrate metaxins. The amino acid identities range from about 22%-28% for each alignment. The presence of two conserved protein domains, GST_N_Metaxin and GST_C_Metaxin, in both plant and bacterial metaxin-like proteins provides evidence that these proteins are related to the vertebrate and invertebrate metaxins. The metaxin-like proteins have predicted secondary structures that are dominated by alpha-helical segments, like the vertebrate and invertebrate metaxins.",

One potential cause for their absence could be that they have a detrimental impact on an organism.

We assign nullomers to different functional categories (coding sequences, exons, introns, 5UTR, 3UTR and promoters) and show that nullomers from coding sequences and promoters are most likely to be selected against. Utilizing variants in the human population, we annotate variant-associated nullomers, highlighting their potential use as DNA  fingerprints. Phylogenetic analyses of nullomers and nullpeptides across evolution shows that they could be used to build phylogenetic trees.

Although they are frequently postulated to regulate cell growth following stress, few null phenotypes for TA systems have been reported. Here, we show that TA transcript levels can increase substantially in response to stress, but toxin is not liberated. We find that the growth of an Escherichia coli strain lacking 10 TA systems encoding endoribonuclease toxins is not affected following exposure to six stresses that each trigger TA transcription. Additionally, using RNA-sequencing, we find no evidence of mRNA cleavage following stress. Stress-induced transcription arises from antitoxin degradation and relief of transcriptional autoregulation. Importantly, although free antitoxin is readily degraded in vivo, antitoxin bound to toxin is protected from proteolysis, preventing release of active toxin. Thus, transcription is not a reliable marker of TA activity, and TA systems likely do not strongly promote survival following stress.",

    "abstract": "Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) control the ordered series of events during eukaryotic cell division. The stage at which individual CDK substrates are phosphorylated can be dictated by cyclin-specific docking motifs. In budding yeast, substrates with Leu/Pro-rich (LP) docking motifs are recognized by Cln1/2 cyclins in late G1 phase, yet the key sequence features of these motifs and the conservation of this mechanism were unknown. Here we comprehensively analyzed LP motif requirements in vivo by combining a competitive growth assay with mutational scanning and deep sequencing. We quantified the impact of all single-residue replacements in five different LP motifs, using six distinct G1 cyclins from diverse fungi including medical and agricultural pathogens. The results reveal the basis for variations in potency among wild-type motifs, and allow derivation of a quantitative matrix that predicts the potency of other candidate motifs. In one protein, Whi5, we found overlapping LP and phosphorylation motifs with partly redundant effects. In another protein, the CDK inhibitor Sic1, we found that its LP motif is inherently weak due to unfavorable residues at key positions, and this imposes a beneficial delay in its phosphorylation and degradation. The overall results provide a general method for surveying viable docking motif sequences and quantifying their potency in vivo, and they reveal how variations in LP motif potency can tune the strength and timing of CDK regulation.",

However, the extent to which volatile anesthetics affect distinct cellular and network components of these circuits remains unclear. Ex vivo brain slices provide a means by which investigators may probe discrete components of complex networks and disentangle potential mechanisms underlying the effects of volatile anesthetics on evoked responses. To isolate potential cell type- and pathway-specific drug effects in brain slices, investigators must be able to independently activate afferent fiber pathways, identify non-overlapping populations of cells, and apply volatile anesthetics to tissue in aqueous solution.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDThe efficacy of an anthracycline antibiotic doxorubicin (DOX) as a chemotherapeutic agent is limited by dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. DOX is associated with activation of intracellular stress signaling pathways including p38 MAPKs. While previous studies have implicated p38 MAPK signaling in DOX-induced cardiac injury, the roles of the individual p38 isoforms, specifically, of the alternative isoforms p38{gamma} and p38{delta}, remain uncharacterized.\n\nOBJECTIVESTo determine the potential cardioprotective effects of p38{gamma} and p38{delta} genetic deletion in mice subjected to acute DOX treatment.\n\nMETHODSMale and female wild-type (WT), p38{gamma}-/-, p38{delta}-/- and p38{gamma}-/-{delta}-/- mice were injected with 30 mg/kg DOX and their survival was tracked for ten days. During this period cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography and electrocardiography and fibrosis by PicroSirius Red staining. Immunoblotting was performed to assess the expression of signaling proteins and markers linked to autophagy.\n\nRESULTSSignificantly improved survival was observed in p38{delta}-/- female mice post-DOX relative to WT females, but not in p38{gamma}-/- or p38{gamma}-/-{delta}-/- male or female mice. The improved survival in DOX-treated p38{delta}-/- females was associated with decreased fibrosis, increased cardiac output and LV diameter relative to DOX-treated WT females, and similar to saline-treated controls. Structural and echocardiographic parameters were either unchanged or worsened in all other groups. Increased autophagy, as evidenced by increased LC3-II level, and decreased mTOR activation was also observed in DOX-treated p38{delta}-/- females.\n\nCONCLUSIONSp38{delta} plays a crucial role in promoting DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in female mice by inhibiting autophagy. Therefore, p38{delta} targeting could be a potential cardioprotective strategy in anthracycline chemotherapy.\n\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYThis study for the first time identifies the roles of the alternative p38{gamma} and p38{delta} MAPK isoforms in promoting DOX-cardiotoxicity in a sex-specific manner. While p38{gamma} systemic deletion did not affect DOX-cardiotoxicity, p38{delta} systemic deletion was cardioprotective in female but not in male mice. Cardiac structure and function were preserved in DOX-treated p38{delta}-/- females and autophagy was increased.",

Cell wall chemistry and the hosts genetic repertoire are discussed to play a role in the resilience of plants against clubroot disease. Plant cells infected with P. brassicae are markedly enlarged, and look very differently from uninfected, healthy cells. Here we systematically review cell wall related processes that lead to the typical clubroot phenotype and provide novel insights how P. brassicae uses these modifications to benefit its own development. An infection with P. brassicae impacts on nearly all cell wall related processes, but all alterations are meaningful for successful growth and development of P. brassicae. Processes related to cell wall stability and rigidity (e.g. cellulose, pectin or lignin synthesis) are down-regulated, while cell wall degrading enzymes or processes that increase the flexibility of the host cell wall (e.g. expansin) are up-regulated. The here presented findings indicate that P. brassicae weakens the structural stability of its host cell while it increases its elasticity, which in consequence allows P. brassicae to grow bigger and ultimately to develop more resting spores. Consequently, the understanding of the modification of the host cell wall is important for the formation of the characteristic root galls but also to better understand clubroot disease.",

We show that miR825-5p downregulates expression of Arabidopsis AT5G38850 gene (renamed as microRNA-silenced TNL 1 or MIST1) by targeting the sequence coding for a highly conserved functional amino acid motif (TIR2) within the TIR domain of the receptor. Further, we show that MIST1 functions as a regulatory hub, since miRNA825-5p triggers RDR6-mediated processing of MIST1 transcripts, to generate trans-acting phasiRNAs that in turn target, a wide network of TNL genes for gene silencing. Regulation through MIST1 affects disease resistance against the model bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, since altered levels of miRNA825-5p lead to changes in Arabidopsis ability to establish basal defenses against this pathogen. MiR825-5p is expressed in unchallenged adult leaves and its production is down regulated in response to PAMPs such as bacterial flagellin but also fungal chitin.",

    "abstract": "Distinct patterns of dinucleotide representation, such as CpG and UpA suppression, are characteristic of certain viral genomes. Recent research has uncovered vertebrate immune mechanisms that select against specific dinucleotides in targeted viruses. This evidence highlights the importance of systematically examining the dinucleotide composition of viral genomes. We have developed a novel metric, called Synonymous Dinucleotide Usage (SDU), for quantifying dinucleotide representation in coding sequences. Our method compares the abundance of a given dinucleotide to the null hypothesis of equal synonymous codon usage in the sequence. We present a Python3 package, DinuQ, for calculating SDU and other relevant metrics. We have applied this method on two sets of invertebrate- and vertebrate-specific flaviviruses and rhabdoviruses. The SDU shows that the vertebrate viruses exhibit consistently greater under-representation of CpG dinucleotides in all three codon positions in both datasets. In comparison to existing metrics for dinucleotide quantification, the SDU allows for a statistical interpretation of its values by comparing it to a null expectation based on the codon table. Here we apply the method to viruses, but coding sequences of other living organisms can be analysed in the same way.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial chemoreceptors are organized in arrays composed of helical receptors arranged as trimers of dimers, coupled to a histidine kinase CheA and a coupling protein CheW. Ligand binding to the external domain inhibits the kinase activity, leading to a change in the swimming behavior. Adaptation to an ongoing stimulus involves reversible methylation and demethylation of specific glutamate residues. However, the exact mechanism of signal propagation through the helical receptor to the histidine kinase remains elusive. Dynamics of the receptor cytoplasmic domain is thought to play an important role in the signal transduction, and current models propose inverse dynamic changes in different regions of the receptor. We hypothesize that the adaptational modification (methylation) controls the dynamics by stabilizing a partially ordered domain, which in turn modulates the binding of the kinase, CheA. We investigated the difference in dynamics between the methylated and unmethylated states of the chemoreceptor using solid-state NMR. The unmethylated receptor (CF4E) shows increased flexibility relative to the methylation mimic (CF4Q). Methylation helix 1 (MH1) has been shown to be flexible in the methylated receptor. Our analysis indicates that in addition to MH1, methylation helix 2 also becomes flexible in the unmethylated receptor. In addition, we have demonstrated that both states of the receptor have a rigid region and segments with intermediate dynamics. The strategies used in the study for identifying dynamic regions are applicable to a broad class of proteins and protein complexes with intrinsic disorder and dynamics spanning multiple timescales.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=130 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/974428v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (22K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8a8b0forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1afb646org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e7dbaaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@685c0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIReceptors exhibit greater ns timescale dynamics in unmethylated vs methylated state\nC_LIO_LIMethylation helix 2 likely involved in increased flexibility of unmethylated state\nC_LIO_LIDynamics occur on multiple timescales in both states of the receptor\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "A central theme in ecological research is to understand how species interactions contribute to community dynamics. Species interactions are the basis of parametric (model-driven) and nonpara-metric (model-free) approaches in theoretical and empirical work. However, despite their different interpretations across these approaches, these measures have occasionally been used interchangeably, limiting our opportunity to use their differences to gain new insights about ecological systems. Here, we revisit two of the most used measures across these approaches: species interactions measured as constant direct effects (typically used in parametric approaches) and local aggregated effects (typically used in nonparametric approaches). We show two fundamental properties of species interactions that cannot be revealed without bridging these definitions. First, we show that the local aggregated intraspecific effect summarizes all potential pathways through which one species impacts itself, which are likely to be negative even without any constant direct self-regulation mechanism. This property has implications for the long-held debate on how communities can be stabilized when little evidence of self-regulation has been found among higher-trophic species. Second, we show that a local aggregated interspecific effect between two species is correlated with the constant direct interspecific effect if and only if the population dynamics do not have any higher-order direct effects. This other property provides a rigorous methodology to detect direct higher-order effects in the field and experimental data. Overall, our findings illustrate a practical route to gain further insights about non-equilibrium ecological dynamics and species interactions.",

    "abstract": "Animal behavior is highly structured. Yet, structured behavioral patterns - or \"statistical ethograms\" - are not immediately apparent from the full spatiotemporal data that behavioral scientists usually collect. Here, we introduce a framework to quantitatively characterize rodent behavior during spatial (e.g., maze) navigation, in terms of movement building blocks or motor primitives. The hypothesis that we pursue is that rodent behavior is characterized by a small number of motor primitives, which are combined over time to produce open-ended movements. We assume motor primitives to be organized in terms of two sparsity principles: each movement is controlled using a limited subset of motor primitives (sparse superposition) and each primitive is active only for time-limited, time-contiguous portions of movements (sparse activity). We formalize this hypothesis using a sparse dictionary learning method, which we use to extract motor primitives from rodent position and velocity data collected during spatial navigation, and successively to reconstruct past trajectories and predict novel ones. Three main results validate our approach. First, rodent behavioral trajectories are robustly reconstructed from incomplete data, performing better than approaches based on standard dimensionality reduction methods, such as principal component analysis, or single sparsity. Second, the motor primitives extracted during one experimental session generalize and afford the accurate reconstruction of rodent behavior across successive experimental sessions in the same or in modified mazes. Third, in our approach the number of motor primitives associated with each maze correlates with independent measures of maze complexity, hence showing that our formalism is sensitive to essential aspects of task structure. The framework introduced here can be used by behavioral scientists and neuroscientists as an aid for behavioral and neural data analysis. Indeed, the extracted motor primitives enable the quantitative characterization of the complexity and similarity between different mazes and behavioral patterns across multiple trials (i.e., habit formation). We provide example uses of this computational framework, showing how it can be used to identify behavioural effects of maze complexity, analyze stereotyped behavior, classify behavioral choices and predict place and grid cell displacement in novel environments.",

    "abstract": "MotivationTemporal behavior is an essential aspect of all biological systems. Time series have been previously represented as networks. Such representations must address two fundamental problems: (i) How to create the appropriate network to reflect the characteristics of biological time series. (ii) How to detect characteristic temporal patterns or events as network communities. General methods to detect communities have used metrics to compare the connectivity within a community to the connectivity one would expect in a random model, or assumed a known number of communities, or are based on the betweenness centrality of edges or nodes. However, such methods were not specifically designed for network representations of time series. We introduce a visibility-graph-based method to build networks from different kinds of biological time series and detect temporal communities within these networks.\n\nResultsTo characterize the uneven sampling of typical experimentally obtained biological time series, and simultaneously capture events associated to peaks and troughs, we introduce the Weighted Dual-Perspective Visibility Graph (WDPVG) for time series. To detect communities, we first find the shortest path of the network between start and end nodes to identify nodes which have high intensities. This identifies the main stem of our community detection algorithm. Then, we aggregate nodes outside the shortest path to the nodes found on the main stem based on the closest path length. Through simulation, we demonstrate the validity of our method in detecting community structures on various networks derived from simulated time series. We also confirm its effectiveness in revealing temporal communities in experimental biological time series. Our results suggest our method of visibility graph based community detection can be effective in detecting temporal biological patterns.\n\nAvailabilityThe methods of building WDPVG and visibility graph based community detection are available as a module of the open source Python package PyIOmica (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3691912) with documentation at https://pyiomica.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

    "abstract": "A key mechanism in cellular regulation is the ability of the transcriptional machinery to physically access DNA. Pioneer transcription factors interact with DNA to open chromatin, which subsequently enables changes to gene expression during development, disease, or as a response to environmental stimuli. However, the regulation of DNA accessibility via the recruitment of transcription factors is difficult to understand in the context of the native genome because every genomic site is distinct in multiple ways. Here we introduce the Multiplexed Integrated Accessibility Assay (MIAA), a multiplexed parallel reporter assay which measures changes to genome accessibility as a result of the integration of synthetic oligonucleotide phrase libraries into a controlled, natively inaccessible genomic context. We apply MIAA to measure the effects of sequence motifs on cell type-specific DNA accessibility between mouse embryonic stem cells and embryonic stem cell-derived definitive endoderm cells, screening a total of 7,905 distinct phrases. MIAA is able to recapitulate differential accessibility patterns of 100-nt sequences derived from natively differential genomic regions, identifying the presence of E-box motifs common to epithelial-mesenchymal transition driver transcription factors in stem cell-specific accessible regions that become repressed during differentiation to endoderm. We further present causal evidence that a single binding motif for a key regulatory transcription factor is sufficient to open chromatin, and classify sets of stem cell-specific, endoderm-specific, and shared pioneer factor motifs. We also demonstrate that over-expression of two definitive endoderm transcription factors, Brachyury and FoxA2, results in changes to accessibility in phrases containing their respective DNA-binding motifs. Finally, we use MIAA results to explore the order of motif interactions and identify preferential motif ordering arrangements that appear to have an effect on accessibility.",

However, longterm PD is associated with significant pathology, negating the positive effects over haemodialysis. Importantly, peritonitis and activation of macrophages is closely associated with disease progression and treatment failure. However, recent advances in macrophage biology suggest opposite functions for macrophages of different cellular origins. While monocyte-derived macrophages promote disease progression in some models of fibrosis, tissue resident macrophages have rather been associated with protective roles. Thus, we aimed to identify the relative contribution of tissue resident macrophages to PD induced inflammation in mice. Unexpectedly, we found an incremental loss of homeostatic characteristics, anti-inflammatory and efferocytic functionality in peritoneal resident macrophages, accompanied by enhanced inflammatory responses to external stimuli. Moreover, presence of glucose degradation products within the dialysis fluid led to markedly enhanced inflammation and almost complete disappearance of tissue resident cells. Thus, alterations in tissue resident macrophages may render longterm PD patients sensitive to developing peritonitis and consequently fibrosis/sclerosis.",

Transferrin level in germ-free and broad-spectrum antibiotics-treated mice is much less than that in normal mice. Transferrin is found to silence TLR signaling complex by directly interacting with CD14, a co-receptor of many TLRs.

Neutrophil co-incubation with 5448AP allowed proliferation of GAS while it also lowered the production of reactive oxygen species by neutrophils when compared with 5448. Infection with both strains invoked neutrophil death, however apoptosis was reduced in response to 5448AP. Both strains induced neutrophil caspase-1 activation and caspase-4 expression in vitro, with caspase-1 activation detected in vivo. Thus, GAS infection of neutrophils corresponds to increased caspase-1 activity and caspase-4 expression, consistent with inflammasome activation and pyroptosis. GAS infections that promote an inflammatory neutrophil phenotype may contribute to increased inflammation yet ineffective bacterial eradication, contributing to the speed and severity of invasive GAS infections.",

The map led to the identification of both the fatty acid desaturation and the sphingolipid biosynthesis pathways as targets for drug development. We found that the sphingolipid biosynthesis inhibitor myriocin, the fatty acid desaturase inhibitor thiocarlide and the fatty acid analog 10-thiastearic acid inhibit H. capsulatum growth in nanomolar to low micromolar concentrations.

We used WHO risk categories for microbiological quality; no risk (<1 MPN), low risk (1-10 MPN) and moderate to high risk (>10 MPN per 100 mL water). We estimated the difference in mean log10 MPN in pond and MAR water using linear mixed effect models with random intercepts and cluster adjusted robust standard error.

In contrast, 81% (242/300) of MAR water samples had no or low risk level fecal coliforms (0-10 MPN), of which 60% (179/300) had no fecal coliforms. We detected no or low risk level E. coli in 94% (283/300) of MAR water samples of these 80% (240/300) had no E. coli. MAR samples had lower mean log10 MPN fecal coliforms (-2.37; 95% CI: -2.56, -2.19) and E. coli (-2.26; 95% CI: - 2.43, -2.09) than pond water; microbial reductions remained consistent during the wet (May-October) and dry seasons. MAR-systems provided water with reduced fecal indicator bacteria compared to infiltered pond water.",

    "abstract": "The parcellation of the cerebral cortex serves the investigation of the emergence of uniquely human brain functions and disorders. We employed hierarchical clustering based on comprehensive transcriptomic data of the human cortex in order to delineate areas with distinct gene expression profiles. These profiles were analyzed for the enrichment of gene sets associated with brain disorders by genome-wide studies (GWAS) and expert curation. This suggested new roles of specific cortical areas in psychiatric, neurodegenerative, congenital and other neurological disorders while reproducing some well-established links for movement disorders and dementias. GWAS-derived gene sets for psychiatric disorders exhibited similar enrichment patterns in the posterior fusiform gyrus and inferior parietal lobule driven by pleiotropic genes. This implies that the effects of risk variants shared between neuropsychiatric disorders might converge in these areas. For several diseases, specific genes were highlighted, which may aid the discovery of novel disease mechanisms and urgently needed treatments.",

    "abstract": "Chronic stress can impact decision-making and lead to a preference for immediate rewards rather than long-term payoffs. Factors that may mitigate these effects of chronic stress on decision-making are under-explored. Here we used a mouse model to investigate the changes in decision-making caused by the experience of chronic stress and the role of social interaction in attenuating these changes. To test decision-making, mice were trained to perform a Cost-Benefit Conflict (CBC) task on a T-maze, in which they could choose between a high-reward, high-risk alternative and a low-reward, low-risk alternative. Mice were either housed in groups or alone throughout the experiment. Both groups of mice underwent a seven-day period of repeated immobilisation to induce chronic stress. Stress levels were confirmed using behavioural (open field test) and physiological (urine corticosterone ELISA) measures. We found a significant increase in frequency of high-risk decisions after exposure to chronic stress among both socially- and individually-housed mice. Crucially, socially-housed mice showed a significantly smaller increase in high-risk decision-making compared to singly-housed mice. These findings suggest that although chronic stress leads to an increase in high-risk decision-making in mice, access to social interaction may mitigate this stress effect.",

We illustrate how distinct criteria of increasing stringency can be used to judge totipotency by evaluating candidate totipotent cell types in the mouse, including early blastomeres and expanded or extended pluripotent stem cells.

    "abstract": "Previous work has shown that fMRI activity patterns associated with individual fingers can be shifted by temporary impairment of the hand. Here, we investigated whether these neural activity patterns could be modulated endogenously and whether any behavioral changes result from this modulation. We used decoded neurofeedback in healthy individuals to encourage participants to shift the neural activity pattern in sensorimotor cortex of the middle finger towards the index finger, and the ring finger towards the little finger. We first mapped the neural activity patterns for all fingers of the right hand in an fMRI pattern localizer session. Then, in three subsequent neurofeedback sessions, participants were rewarded after middle/ring finger presses according to their activity pattern overlap during each trial. A force-sensitive keyboard was used to ensure that participants were not altering their physical finger coordination patterns. We found evidence that participants could learn to shift the activity pattern of the ring finger but not of the middle finger. Increased variability of these activity patterns during the localizer session was associated with the ability of participants to modulate them using neurofeedback. Participants also showed an increased preference for the ring finger but not for the middle finger in a post-neurofeedback motor task. Our results show that neural activity and behaviors associated with the ring finger are more readily modulated than those associated with the middle finger. These results have broader implications for rehabilitation of individual finger movements, which may be limited or enhanced by individual finger plasticity after neurological injury.",

    "abstract": "Humans can covertly track the position of an object, even if the object is temporarily occluded. What are the neural mechanisms underlying our capacity to track moving objects when there is no physical stimulus for the brain to track? One possibility is that the brain \"fills-in\" information about imagined objects using internally generated representations similar to those generated by feed-forward perceptual mechanisms. Alternatively, the brain might deploy a higher order mechanism, for example using an object tracking model that integrates visual signals and motion dynamics (Kwon et al., 2015). In the present study, we used electroencephalography (EEG) and time-resolved multivariate pattern analyses to investigate the spatial processing of visible and imagined objects. Participants tracked an object that moved in discrete steps around fixation, occupying six consecutive locations. They were asked to imagine that the object continued on the same trajectory after it disappeared and move their attention to the corresponding positions. Time-resolved decoding of EEG data revealed that the location of the visible stimuli could be decoded shortly after image onset, consistent with early retinotopic visual processes. For processing of unseen/imagined positions, the patterns of neural activity resembled stimulus-driven mid-level visual processes, but were detected earlier than perceptual mechanisms, implicating an anticipatory and more variable tracking mechanism. Encoding models revealed that spatial representations were much weaker for imagined than visible stimuli. Monitoring the position of imagined objects thus utilises similar perceptual and attentional processes as monitoring objects that are actually present, but with different temporal dynamics. These results indicate that internally generated representations rely on top-down processes, and their timing is influenced by the predictability of the stimulus.

    "abstract": "1.Arterial Spin Labelling (ASL) is a non-invasive, non-contrast, perfusion imaging technique which is inherently SNR limited. It is, therefore, important to carefully design scan protocols to ensure accurate measurements. Many pseudo-continuous ASL (PCASL) protocol designs have been proposed for measuring cerebral blood flow (CBF), but it has not yet been demonstrated which design offers the most accurate and repeatable CBF measurements. In this work, a wide range of literature PCASL protocols, including single-delay, sequential and time-encoded multi-timepoint protocols, and several novel protocol designs, which are hybrids of time-encoded and sequential multi-timepoint protocols, were first optimised using a Cramer-Rao Lower Bound framework and then compared for CBF accuracy and repeatability using Monte Carlo simulations and in vivo experiments. It was found that several multi-timepoint protocols produced more confident, accurate, and repeatable CBF estimates than the single-delay protocol, while also generating maps of arterial transit time. One of the novel hybrid protocols, HybridT1-adj, was found to produce the most confident, accurate and repeatable CBF estimates of all protocols tested in both simulations and in vivo (24%, 47%, and 28% more confident, accurate, and repeatable than single-PLD in vivo). The HybridT1-adj protocol makes use of the best aspects of both time-encoded and sequential multi-timepoint protocols and should be a useful tool for accurately and efficiently measuring CBF.",

    "abstract": "Mechanosensing has been recently explored for T cells and B cells and is believed to be part of their activation mechanism. Here, we explore the mechanosensing of the third type of lymphocytes - Natural Killer (NK) cells, by showing that they modulate their immune activity in response to changes in the stiffness of a stimulating surface. Interestingly, we found that this immune response is bell-shaped, and peaks for a stiffness of a few hundreds of kPa. This bell-shape behavior was observed only for surfaces functionalized with the activating ligand MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA), but not for control surfaces lacking immunoactive functionalities. We found that stiffness does not affect uniformly all cells but increases the size of a little group of extra-active cells, which in turn contribute to the overall activation effect of the entire cell population. We further imaged the clustering of costimulatory adapter protein DAP10 on NK cell membrane and found that it shows the same bell -shape dependence to surface stiffness. Based on these findings, we propose a catch-bond-based model for the mechanoregulation of NK cell cytotoxic activity, through interaction of NKG2D activating receptors with MICA. Our findings reveal what seems to be \"the tip of iceberg\" of mechanosensation of NK cells, and provides an important insight on the mechanism of their immune signaling.\n\nStatement of SignificanceThe mechanical sensing of immune lymphocytes was recently demonstrated for T cells and B cells, but not for the third type of lymphocytes - Natural Killer (NK) cells. Interestingly, previous reports on lymphocyte mechanosensing were controversial, and showed either positive or negative changes in their immune activity with environmental stiffness, depending on the stiffness range. In this paper, we directly demonstrated that NK cells modulate their response with the stiffness of the stimulating surface, and this modulation has a bell-shape trend. We found that there is a strong correlation between the response to stiffness and clustering of adaptor proteins. Upon this correlation, we proposed a mechanosensing model based on the catch-bond nature of activating ligand-receptor complexes in NK cells.",

The catalytic activity of PRC2 is counteracted by Jumonji-type (JMJ) histone demethylases, which shapes the genomic distribution of H3K27me3. Here, we show that two JMJ histone demethylases in Arabidopsis, EARLY FLOWERING 6 (ELF6) and RELATIVE OF EARLY FLOWERING 6 (REF6), play distinct roles in H3K27me3 and H3K27me1 homeostasis. We show that failure to reset these chromatin marks during sexual reproduction results in the inheritance of epigenetic imprints, which cause a loss of DNA methylation at heterochromatic loci and transposon activation. Thus, Jumonji-type histone demethylases in plants contribute towards maintaining distinct transcriptional states during development and help safeguard genome integrity following sexual reproduction.",

This is first observed in the thymus, the primary lymphoid organ that generates and selects T cells. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning these ageing processes remain unclear. Here, we show that mouse ageing leads to less efficient T cell selection, decreased self-antigen representation and increased T cell receptor repertoire diversity. Using a combination of single-cell RNA-seq and lineage-tracing, we find that progenitor cells are the principal targets of ageing, whereas the function of mature thymic epithelial cells is compromised only modestly. Specifically, an early-life precursor cell population, retained in the mouse cortex postnatally, is virtually extinguished at puberty. Concomitantly, a medullary precursor cell quiesces, thereby impairing maintenance of the medullary epithelium. Thus, ageing disrupts thymic progenitor differentiation and impairs the core immunological functions of the thymus.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCognitive impairment is a common symptom in the patients with Parkinsons disease (PD). In delineating a therapeutic plan, the early diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment in PD (PD-MCI) is important. Patients with PD-MCI have severe impairment in frontal executive function and/or visuospatial recognition. However, the clinical assessment of these functions is not routinely performed.\n\nMethodIn this study, we aimed to clarify the advantage of visuospatial version of the n-back test as a tool for the early detection of neuropsychological change in the patients with PD-MCI. The score of 0-back test reflects visuospatial recognition, and the scores of 1-back and 2-back reflect visuospatial working memory. PD-MCI was classified according to the criteria provided by the Movement Disorder Society Task Force for mild cognitive impairment in PD. We recruited 13 patients with PD-MCI, and 15 patients with cognitive normal PD. Using functional MRI (fMRI), we also aimed to clarify the specific brain regions associated with the impairment of visuospatial working memory.\n\nResultWe demonstrated that the correct answer rate of patients with PD-MCI was lower in the 2-back test than patients with PD-CN. However, we did not find statistical difference in the 0-back test. These results indicate the preservation of visuospatial recognition and the impairment of visuospatial working memory in the patients with PD-MCI. We revealed the reduced activation within the middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) during the 2-back test in the patients with PD-MCI. It may be associated with the severity of cortico-striatal dysfunction in the dopaminergic neural network which is associated with Lewy body pathology.\n\nConclusionThe visuospatial n-back test has advantages for use in rapid and early detection of impaired visual recognition and working memory. The combination of functional neuroimaging and neuropsychological tests may provide markers for the increased risk of dementia before the development of an irreversible disease-specific pathology.",

X-ray diffraction (XRD) and attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) validate phase purity of green synthesize Zinc oxide nanoparticles whereas, electron microscopy (SEM) has illustrated the average size of particle 50{+/-}4 nm with hexagonal rod like shape. Energy dispersive Xray (EDS) spectra depict major peaks of Zn (92.68%) while minor peaks refer to Oxygen (7.32%). ZnO NPs demonstrate the incredibly promising results against callogenesis. Biosynthesized ZnO NPs at optimum concentration showed very promising effect on plant regeneration ability. Both the explants, seeds and nodes used in study showed dose dependent response and upon high doses exceeding 40 mg/L the results were recorded negative, whereas at 30 mg/L both explants demonstrate 70 % and 76 % regeneration frequency.

In this study, we showed that deletion of the sRNA RgsA decreases the growth rate and ability to resist different concentrations and durations of peroxide in P. aeruginosa. These decreases occur not only in the planktonic state, but also in the biofilm state. Finally, protein mass spectrometry was employed to understand changes in the entire protein spectrum. The results presented herein provide a description of the role of RgsA in the life activities of P. aeruginosa at the molecular, phenotypic, and protein levels.",

    "abstract": "The slow afterhyperpolarising current, sIAHP, is a Ca2+-dependent current that plays an important role in the late phase of spike frequency adaptation. sIAHP is activated by voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, while the contribution of calcium from ryanodine-sensitive intracellular stores, released by calcium-induced calcium release (CICR), is controversial in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Three types of ryanodine receptors (RyR1-3) are expressed in the hippocampus, with RyR3 showing a predominant expression in CA1 neurons. We investigated the specific role of CICR, and particularly of its RyR3-mediated component, in the regulation of the sIAHP amplitude and time course, and the activity-dependent potentiation of the sIAHP in rat and mouse CA1 pyramidal neurons.\n\nHere we report that enhancement of CICR by caffeine led to an increase in sIAHP amplitude, while inhibition of CICR by ryanodine caused a small, but significant reduction of sIAHP. Inhibition of ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ stores by ryanodine or depletion by the SERCA pump inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid caused a substantial attenuation in the sIAHP activity-dependent potentiation in both rat and mouse CA1 pyramidal neurons. Neurons from mice lacking RyR3 receptors exhibited a sIAHP with features undistinguishable from wild-type neurons, which was similarly reduced by ryanodine. However, the lack of RyR3 receptors led to a faster and reduced activity-dependent potentiation of sIAHP.\n\nWe conclude that ryanodine receptor-mediated CICR contributes both to the amplitude of the sIAHP at steady state and its activity-dependent potentiation in rat and mouse hippocampal pyramidal neurons. In particular, we show that RyR3 receptors play an essential and specific role in shaping the activity-dependent potentiation of the sIAHP. The modulation of activity-dependent potentiation of sIAHP by RyR3-mediated CICR contributes to plasticity of intrinsic neuronal excitability and is likely to play a critical role in higher cognitive functions, such as learning and memory.",

    "abstract": "Sleep inertia is the potentially harmful decline in cognition that occurs upon and following awakening. Sound has been shown to counteract the negative symptoms of sleep inertia, with a recent study revealing that an alarm perceived as melodic by participants displayed a significant relationship to reports of reductions in perceived sleep inertia. This current research builds on these findings by specifically testing the effect melodic and rhythmic stimuli exhibit on sleep inertia for subjects awakening in their habitual environments. Two test Groups (A & B; N = 10 equally) completed an online psychomotor experiment and questionnaire in two separate test sessions immediately following awakening from nocturnal sleep epochs. Both groups responded to a Control stimulus in the first session, while in the second session, Group A experienced a Melodic treatment, and Group B the Rhythmic. The results show that the melodic treatment significantly decreased attentional Lapses, False Starts and had a significantly improved PVT Performance Score than the Control. There was no significant result for Reaction Time or Response Speed. Additionally, no significant difference was observed for all PVT metrics between the Control - Rhythmic conditions. The results support melodies potential to counteract symptoms of sleep inertia by the observed increase in participant vigilance following waking. Specifically, a melodically rhythmic contour is highlighted as a significant musical treatment noteworthy of consideration when designing alarm compositions for the reduction of sleep inertia. As auditory assisted awakening is a common within modern society, improvements in alarm sound design may have advantages in domestic and commercial settings.",

    "abstract": "In various cellular functions, post translational modifications (PTM) of protein play a vital role. The addition of certain functional group through a covalent bond to the protein induces PTM. The number of PTMs are identified which are closely linked with diseases for example cancer and neurological disorder. Hydroxylation is one of the PTM, modified proline residue within a polypeptide sequence. The defective hydroxylation of proline causes absences of ascorbic acid in human which produce scurvy, and many other dominant health issues. Undoubtedly, the prediction of hydroxylation sites in proline residues is of challenging frontier. The experimental identification of hydroxyproline site is quite difficult, high-priced and time-consuming. The diversity in protein sequences instigates to develop a computational tool to identify hydroxylated site within short time with excellent prediction accuracy to handle such proteomics problems. In this work a novel in silico predictor is developed through rigorous mathematical modeling to identify which site of proline is hydroxylated and which site is not? Then performance of the predictor was verified using three validations tests, namely self-consistency test, cross-validation test and jackknife test over the benchmark dataset. A comparison was established for jackknife test with the previous methods. In comparison with previous predictors the proposed tool is more accurate than the existing techniques. Hence this scheme is highly useful and inspiring in contrast to all previous predictors.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian organs are nourished by nutrients carried by the blood circulation. These nutrients originate from diet and internal stores, and can undergo various interconversions before their eventual use as tissue fuel. Here we develop isotope tracing, mass spectrometry, and mathematical analysis methods to determine the direct sources of circulating nutrients, their interconversion rates, and eventual tissue-specific contributions to TCA cycle metabolism. Experiments with fifteen nutrient tracers enabled extensive accounting both for circulatory metabolic cycles and tissue TCA inputs, across fed and fasted mice on either high carbohydrate or ketogenic diet. We find that a majority of circulating carbon flux is carried by two major cycles: glucose-lactate and triglyceride-glycerol-fatty acid. Futile cycling through these pathways is prominent when dietary content of the associated nutrients is low, rendering internal metabolic activity robust to food choice. The presented in vivo flux quantification methods are broadly applicable to different physiological and disease states.",
