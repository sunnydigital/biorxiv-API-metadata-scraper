    "abstract": "1Life continues to shock and amaze us, reminding us that truth is far stranger than fiction. http://Euplotid.io is a quantized geometric model of the eukaryotic cell, an attempt at quantifying the incredible complexity that gives rise to a living cell by beginning from the smallest unit, a quanta. Starting from the very bottom we are able to build the pieces which when hierarchically and combinatorially combined produce the emergent complex behavior that even a single celled organism can show. Euplotid is composed of a set of quantized geometric 3D building blocks and constantly evolving dockerized bioinformatic pipelines enabling a user to build and interact with the local regulatory architecture of every gene starting from DNA-interactions, chromatin accessibility, and RNA-sequencing. Reads are quantified using the latest computational tools and the results are normalized, quality-checked, and stored. The local regulatory architecture of each gene is built using a Louvain based graph partitioning algorithm parameterized by the chromatin extrusion model and CTCF-CTCF interactions. Cis-Regulatory Elements are defined using chromatin accessibility peaks which are mapped to Transcriptional Start Sites based on inclusion within the same neighborhood. Deep Neural Networks are trained in order to provide a statistical model mimicking transcription factor binding, giving the ability to identify all Transcription Factors within a given chromatin accessibility peak. By in-silico mutating and re-applying the neural network we are able to gauge the impact of a transition mutation on the binding of any transcription factor. The annotated output can be visualized in a variety of 1D, 2D, 3D and 4D ways overlaid with existing bodies of knowledge such as GWAS results or PDB structures. Once a particular CRE of interest has been identified a Base Editor mediated transition mutation can then be performed in a relevant model for further study.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=182 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/170159v15_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a55a1borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bebb0dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ea5b11org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@100e735_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 0.1:C_FLOATNO Graphical Abstract\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Mutational load is the depression in a populations mean fitness that results from the continual influx of deleterious mutations. Here, we directly estimate the mutational load in a population of haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae that are deficient for mismatch repair. We partition the load in haploids into two components. To estimate the load due to nonlethal mutations, we measure the competitive fitness of hundreds of randomly selected clones from both mismatch repair-deficient and - proficient populations. Computation of the mean clone fitness for the mismatch repair-deficient strain permits an estimation of the nonlethal load, and the histogram of fitness provides an interesting visualization of a loaded population. In a separate experiment, in order to estimate the load due to lethal mutations (i.e. the lethal mutation rate), we manipulate thousands of individual pairs of mother and daughter cells and track their fates. These two approaches yield point estimates for the two contributors to load, and the addition of these estimates is nearly equal to the separately measured short-term competitive fitness deficit for the mismatch repair-deficient strain. This correspondence suggests that there is no need to invoke direct fitness effects to explain the fitness difference between mismatch repair-deficient and - proficient strains. Assays in diploids are consistent with deleterious mutations in diploids tending towards recessivity. These results enhance our understanding of mutational load, a central population genetics concept, and we discuss their implications for the evolution of mutation rates.",

    "abstract": "In complex real-life motor skills such as unconstrained throwing, performance depends on how accurate is on average the outcome of noisy, high-dimensional, and redundant actions. What characteristics of the action distribution relate to performance and how different individuals select specific action distributions are key questions in motor control. Previous computational approaches have highlighted that variability along the directions of first order derivatives of the action-to-outcome mapping affects performance the most, that different mean actions may be associated to regions of the actions space with different sensitivity to noise, and that action covariation in addition to noise magnitude matters. However, a method to relate individual high-dimensional action distribution and performance is still missing. Here we introduce a de-composition of performance into a small set of indicators that compactly and directly characterize the key performance-related features of the distribution of high-dimensional redundant actions. Central to the method is the observation that, if performance is quantified as a mean score, the Hessian (second order derivatives) of the action-to-score function determines how the noise of the action distribution affects the average score. We can then approximate the mean score as the sum of the score of the mean action and a tolerance-variability index which depends on both Hessian and action covariance. Such index can be expressed as the product of three terms capturing noise magnitude, noise sensitivity, and alignment of the most variable and most noise sensitive directions. We apply this method to the analysis of unconstrained throwing actions by non-expert participants and show that, consistently across four different throwing targets, each participant shows a specific selection of mean action score and tolerance-variability index as well as specific selection of noise magnitude and alignment indicators. Thus, participants with different strategies may display the same performance because they can trade off suboptimal mean action for better tolerance-variability and higher action variability for better alignment with more tolerant directions in action space.\n\nAuthor summaryWhy do people differ in their performance of complex motor skills? In many real-life motor tasks achieving a goal requires selecting an appropriate high-dimensional action out of infinitely many goal-equivalent actions. Because of sensorimotor noise, we are unable to execute the exact same movement twice and our performance depends on how accurate we are on average. Thus, to understand why people perform differently we need to characterize how their action distribution relates to their mean task score. While better performance is often associated to smaller variability around a more accurate mean action, performance also depends on the relationship between the directions of highest variability in action space and the directions in which action variability affects the most the outcome of the action. However, characterizing such geometric relationship when actions are high dimensional is challenging. In this work we introduce a method that allows to characterize the key performance-related features of the distribution of high-dimensional actions by a small set of indicators. We can then compare such indicators in different people performing a complex task (such as unconstrained throwing) and directly characterize the most skilled ones but also identify different strategies that distinguish people with similar performance.",

    "abstract": "1It is commonly asserted that when extrinsic mortality is high, individuals should invest early in reproduction. This intuition thrives in the literature on life-history theory and human behavior, yet it has been criticized repeatedly on the basis of mathematical models. The intuition is indeed wrong; but a recent theoretical criticism has confused the reason why it is wrong, thereby obscuring earlier and sounder criticisms. In the present article, based on the simplest possible model, we sought to clarify these issues. We confirm earlier findings that extrinsic mortality can affect the evolution of pace of life, not because it leaves little time to reproduce, but through its effects on density-dependent competition. This result highlights the importance of accounting for density-dependence in theoretical models and data analyses. Further, we find little support for the recent claim that the direction of selection on a reaction norm in a variable environment cannot be easily inferred from models made in homogeneous environments. In conclusion, although life-history theory is still imperfect, it has provided simple results that deserve to be understood.",

    "abstract": "The fraction of the human genome that is functional is a question of both evolutionary and practical importance. Studies of sequence divergence have suggested that the functional fraction of the human genome is likely to be no more than [~]15%. In contrast, the ENCODE project, a systematic effort to map regions of transcription, transcription factor association, chromatin structure, and histone modification, assigned function to 80% of the human genome. In this paper we examine whether and how an analysis based on mutational load might set a limit on the functional fraction. In order to do so, we characterize the distribution of fitness of a large, finite, diploid population at mutation-selection equilibrium. In particular, if mean fitness is [~]1, the fitness of the fittest individual likely to occur cannot be unreasonably high. We find that at equilibrium, the distribution of log fitness has variance nus, where u is the per-base deleterious mutation rate, n is the number of functional sites (and hence incorporates the functional fraction f), and s is the selection coefficient of deleterious mutations. In a large (N = 109) reproducing population, the fitness of the fittest individual likely to exist is [Formula]. These results apply to both additive and recessive fitness schemes. Our approach is different from previous work that compared mean fitness at mutation-selection equilibrium to the fitness of an individual who has no deleterious mutations; we show that such an individual is exceedingly unlikely to exist. We find that the functional fraction is not very likely to be limited substantially by mutational load, and that any such limit, if it exists, depends strongly on the selection coefficients of new deleterious mutations.",

    "abstract": "Fungal diseases are responsible for the deaths of over 1.5 million people worldwide annually. Antifungal peptides represent a useful source of antifungals with novel mechanisms-of-action, and potentially provide new methods of overcoming resistance. Here we investigate the mode-of-action of the small, rationally designed synthetic antifungal peptide PAF26 using the model fungus Neurospora crassa. Here we show that the cell killing activity of PAF26 is dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and the presence of fully functioning fungal Ca2+ homeostatic/signalling machinery. In a screen of mutants with deletions in Ca2+-signalling machinery, we identified three mutants more tolerant to PAF26. The Ca2+ ATPase NCA-2 was found to be involved in the initial interaction of PAF26 with the cell envelope. The vacuolar Ca2+ channel YVC-1 was shown to be essential for its accumulation and concentration within the vacuolar system. The Ca2+ channel CCH-1 was found to be required to prevent the translocation of PAF26 across the plasma membrane. In the wild type, Ca2+ removal from the medium resulted in the peptide remaining trapped in small vesicles as in the{Delta} yvc-1 mutant. It is therefore apparent that cell killing by PAF26 is complex and unusually dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and components of the Ca2+-regulatory machinery.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYLife threatening diseases can be caused when fungi invade human tissues. These invasions often occur when a persons immune defences are down, often due to treatments for cancer or transplantation. These infections are commonly buried deep within the body and as such are difficult to access and treat. Current medications are often highly toxic to the patient. There is also a worrying rise in drug resistance seen in fungi sampled from patients, with infections effectively untreatable - a death sentence. Antifungal peptides such as PAF26 provide a possible solution by offering a cheap and rapidly produced alternative to conventional drugs. However, unlike antibacterial peptides, little is known about how these small molecules mostly exert their effects and cause death. Using live-cell imaging and deletion mutants, this study provides an analysis of the important roles that Ca2+-homeostasis and Ca2+-signalling, and possible accompanying vacuolar fusion, play during the dynamic internalization and interaction with and within the fungal cell following PAF26 treatment.",

    "abstract": "Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is the most common form of chronic liver disease in adults and children. It is characterized by excessive accumulation of lipids in the hepatocytes of patients without any excess alcohol intake. With a global presence of 24% and limited therapeutic options, the disease burden of NAFLD is increasing. Thus, it becomes imperative to attempt to understand the dynamics of disease progression at a systems-level. Here, we decode the emergent dynamics of underlying gene regulatory networks that have been identified to drive the initiation and progression of NAFLD. We have developed a mathematical model to elucidate the dynamics of the HNF4-PPAR{gamma} gene regulatory network. Our simulations reveal that this network can enable multiple co-existing phenotypes under certain biological conditions: an adipocyte, a hepatocyte, and a \"hybrid\" adipocyte-like state of the hepatocyte. These phenotypes may also switch among each other, thus enabling phenotypic plasticity and consequently leading to simultaneous deregulation of the levels of molecules that maintain a hepatic identity and/or facilitate a partial or complete acquisition of adipocytic traits. These predicted trends are supported by the analysis of clinical data, further substantiating the putative role of phenotypic plasticity in driving NAFLD. Our results unravel how the emergent dynamics of underlying regulatory networks can promote phenotypic plasticity, thereby propelling the clinically observed changes in gene expression often associated with NAFLD.",

The GDDM framework augments traditional DDM parameters through arbitrary user-defined functions. Models are simulated numerically by directly solving the Fokker-Planck equation using efficient numerical methods, yielding a 100-fold or greater speedup over standard methodology. This speed allows GDDMs to be fit to data using maximum likelihood on the full response time (RT) distribution.

    "abstract": "Understanding how neural networks generate activity patterns and communicate with each other requires monitoring the electrical activity from many neurons simultaneously. Perfectly suited tools for addressing this challenge are genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) because they can be targeted to specific cell types and optically report the electrical activity of individual, or populations of neurons. However, analyzing and interpreting the data from voltage imaging experiments is challenging because high recording speeds and properties of current GEVIs yield only low signal-to-noise ratios, making it necessary to apply specific analytical tools. Here, we present NOSA (Neuro-Optical Signal Analysis), a novel open source software designed for analyzing voltage imaging data and identifying temporal interactions between electrical activity patterns of different origin.\n\nIn this manuscript we explain the challenges that arise during voltage imaging experiments and provide hands-on analytical solutions. We demonstrate how NOSAs baseline fitting, filtering algorithms and movement correction can compensate for shifts in baseline fluorescence and extract electrical patterns from low signal-to-noise recordings. Moreover, NOSA contains powerful features to identify oscillatory frequencies in electrical patterns and extract neuronal firing characteristics. NOSA is the first open-access software to provide an option for analyzing simultaneously recorded optical and electrical data derived from patch-clamp or other electrode-based recordings. To identify temporal relations between electrical activity patterns we implemented different options to perform cross correlation analysis, demonstrating their utility during voltage imaging in Drosophila and mice. All features combined, NOSA will facilitate the first steps into using GEVIs and help to realize their full potential for revealing cell-type specific connectivity and functional interactions.

    "abstract": "Understanding how neural networks generate activity patterns and communicate with each other requires monitoring the electrical activity from many neurons simultaneously. Perfectly suited tools for addressing this challenge are genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) because they can be targeted to specific cell types and optically report the electrical activity of individual, or populations of neurons. However, analyzing and interpreting the data from voltage imaging experiments is challenging because high recording speeds and properties of current GEVIs yield only low signal-to-noise ratios, making it necessary to apply specific analytical tools. Here, we present NOSA (Neuro-Optical Signal Analysis), a novel open source software designed for analyzing voltage imaging data and identifying temporal interactions between electrical activity patterns of different origin.\n\nIn this manuscript we explain the challenges that arise during voltage imaging experiments and provide hands-on analytical solutions. We demonstrate how NOSAs baseline fitting, filtering algorithms and movement correction can compensate for shifts in baseline fluorescence and extract electrical patterns from low signal-to-noise recordings. Moreover, NOSA contains powerful features to identify oscillatory frequencies in electrical patterns and extract neuronal firing characteristics. NOSA is the first open-access software to provide an option for analyzing simultaneously recorded optical and electrical data derived from patch-clamp or other electrode-based recordings. To identify temporal relations between electrical activity patterns we implemented different options to perform cross correlation analysis, demonstrating their utility during voltage imaging in Drosophila and mice. All features combined, NOSA will facilitate the first steps into using GEVIs and help to realize their full potential for revealing cell-type specific connectivity and functional interactions. If you would like to test NOSA, please send an email to the lead contact.",

    "abstract": "The ability to successfully regulate negative emotions such as fear and anxiety is vital for mental health. The neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) acts as important modulator of emotion regulation, as reflected by reduced amygdala responses but increased amygdala-prefrontal cortex (PFC) functional connectivity in response to threatening stimuli. The present randomized, between-subject, placebo (PLC)-controlled pharmacological study combined intranasal administration of OXT with functional MRI during an explicit (cognitive) emotion regulation (i.e. distancing reappraisal) paradigm in 65 healthy male participants to investigate the modulatory effects of OXT on both bottom-up and top-down emotion regulation. OXT attenuated the activation in posterior insular cortex and amygdala during anticipation of top-down regulation of predictable threat stimuli in participants with high trait anxiety, providing evidence to support the anxiolytic action of OXT. In contrast, OXT enhanced amygdala activity during bottom-up anticipation of an unpredictable threat stimulus in participants with low trait anxiety. OXT may thus facilitate top-down goal-directed attention by attenuating amygdala activity in high anxiety individuals, while promote bottom-up attention/vigilance to unexpected threat by enhancing anticipatory amygdala activity in low anxiety individuals. The opposite effects of OXT on anticipatory amygdala activation in high versus low anxiety individuals may suggest a baseline anxiety level dependent mechanism via which OXT promotes optimal levels of amygdala activation during the anticipation of an imminent threat. OXT may thus have the potential to promote an adaptive balance between bottom-up and top-down attention systems depending on individual levels of pre-treatment trait anxiety levels.",

    "abstract": "Plant sex determining systems and sex chromosomes are often evolutionarily young. Here, we present the early stage of sex chromosome in a fully dioecious plant, P. deltoides, by determining separate sequences of the physically small X- and Y-linked regions. Intriguingly, two Y genes are absent from the X counterpart. One gene represses female structures by producing siRNAs that block expression of a gene necessary for development of female structures, via RNA-directed DNA methylation and siRNA-guided mRNA cleavage. The other gene generates long non-coding RNA transcripts that, in males, soak up miRNAs that specifically inhibit androecium development. Transformation experiments in Arabidopsis thaliana show that the two genes affect gynoecium and androecium development independently and antagonistically. Sex determination in the poplar therefore has the properties proposed for the first steps in the evolution of dioecy in flowering plants, with two genes whose joint effects favor close linkage, as is observed in poplar.",

    "abstract": "The multienzyme glycine cleavage system (GCS) converts glycine and tetrahydrofolate to the one-carbon compound 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, which is of vital importance for most if not all organisms. Photorespiring plant mitochondria contain very high levels of GCS proteins organised as a fragile glycine decarboxylase complex (GDC). The aim of this study is to provide mass spectrometry-based stoichiometric data for the plant leaf GDC and examine whether complex formation could be a general property of the GCS in photosynthesizing organisms. The molar ratios of the leaf GDC component proteins are 1L2-4P2-8T-26H and 1L2-4P2-8T-20H for pea and Arabidopsis, respectively, as determined by mass spectrometry. The minimum mass of the plant leaf GDC ranges from 1,550-1,650 kDa, which is larger than previously assumed. The Arabidopsis GDC contains four times more of the isoforms GCS-P1 and GCS-L1 in comparison with GCS-P2 and GCS-L2, respectively, whereas the H-isoproteins GCS-H1 and GCS-H3 are fully redundant as indicated by their about equal amounts. Isoform GCS-H2 is not present in leaf mitochondria. In the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, GCS proteins are present at low concentration but above the complex formation threshold reported for pea leaf GDC. Indeed, formation of a cyanobacterial GDC from the individual recombinant GCS proteins in vitro could be demonstrated. Presence and metabolic significance of a Synechocystis GDC in vivo remain to be examined but could involve multimers of the GCS H-protein that dynamically crosslink the three GCS enzyme proteins, facilitating glycine metabolism by the formation of multienzyme metabolic complexes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenetic and environmental factors, alone or in combination, contribute to the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although many protein-coding genes have now been identified as disease risk genes for ASD, a detailed illustration of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) associated with ASD remains elusive. In this study, our aim was to identify ASD-related lncRNAs and explore their functions and associated biological pathways in autism.\n\nMethodsASD-related lncRNAs were identified based on genomic variant data of individuals with ASD from a twin study, and further validated using an independent copy number variant (CNV) dataset. The functions and associated biological pathways of ASD-related lncRNAs were explored by enrichment analysis of three different types of functional neighbor genes (i.e. genomic neighbors, competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) neighbors and gene co-expression neighbors in the cortex). The differential functions of ASD-related lncRNAs in distinct brain regions were demonstrated by using gene co-expression network analysis based on tissue-specific gene expression profiles. Moreover, a functional network analysis were conducted for highly reliable functional neighbor genes of ASD-related lncRNAs. Finally, several potential drugs were predicted based on the enrichment of drug-induced pathway sets in ASD-altered biological pathway list.\n\nResultsIn total, 532 ASD-related lncRNAs were identified, and 86.7% of these ASD-related lncRNAs were further validated by a copy number variant (CNV) dataset. Most of functional neighbor genes of ASD-related lncRNAs were enriched in several functions and biological pathways, including nervous system development, inflammatory response and transcriptional regulation. As a set, ASD-related lncRNAs were mainly associated with nervous system development and dopaminergic synapse in the cortex, but associated with transcriptional regulation in the cerebellum. Moreover, all highly reliable functional neighbor genes were connected in a single functional network. Finally, several potential drugs were predicted and partly supported by the previous reports.\n\nConclusionsWe concluded that ASD-related lncRNAs participate in the pathogenesis of ASD through various known biological pathways, which may be differential in distinct brain regions. And detailed investigation of ASD-related lncRNAs also provided clues for developing potential ASD diagnosis biomarker and therapy.",

In submerged culture, menthol significantly increased calcium influx and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) via the TRPM8 receptor, responses that were inhibited by a TRPM8 antagonist. VITROCELL(R) cloud chamber exposure of BEAS-2B monolayers increased mitochondrial protein oxidation, expression of the antioxidant enzyme SOD2, activation of NF-{kappa}B, and secretion of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8). Proteomics data collected following ALI exposure of 3D EpiAirway tissue in the Cultex showed upregulation of NRF-2-mediated oxidative stress, oxidative phosphorylation, and IL-8 signaling.

In normal cellular physiology, CHD8 co-purifies with MLL1 and MOF transcriptional activation complex, with elongating RNAPII and directly binds to DNA promoters and enhancers regions, thus a regulatory role in transcriptional initiation and elongation could be postulated.\n\nHere we investigated how chromatin landscape reacts to CHD8 suppression by analyzing a panel of histone modifications in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitors. We interrogated transcriptionally active and repressed regions, as well as active and poised enhancers.\n\nCHD8 suppression led to significant reduction (47.82%) in histone H3K36me3 peaks at gene bodies, particularly impacting on transcriptional elongation chromatin states. H3K36me3 reduction specifically affects highly expressed, CHD8-bound genes. Histone H3K36me3 reduction associated to CHD8-suppression does not functionally impact on global transcriptional levels, but correlated with altered alternative splicing patterns of [~] 2000 protein coding genes implicated in \"RNA splicing\", \"mitotic cell cycle phase transition\" and \"mRNA processing\", especially affecting alternative first exon and exon skipping events.\n\nIn summary, our results point toward broad molecular consequences of CHD8 suppression, implicating altered histone deposition/maintenance and RNA processing regulation as important regulatory processes in ASD.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus sobrinus is one of two species of bacteria that cause dental caries (tooth decay) in humans. Our knowledge of S. sobrinus is limited despite the organisms important role in oral health. It is widely believed that S. sobrinus lacks the natural competence pathways that are used by other streptococci to regulate growth, virulence, and quorum sensing. The lack of natural competence has also prevented genetic manipulation of S. sobrinus, limiting our knowledge of its pathogenicity.\n\nWe discovered a functional ComRS competence system in S. sobrinus. The ComRS pathway in S. sobrinus has a unique structure, including two copies of the transcriptional regulator ComR and a peptide pheromone (XIP) that lacks aromatic amino acids. We show that synthetic XIP allows transformation of S. sobrinus with plasmid or linear DNA, and we leverage this newfound genetic tractability to confirm that only one of the ComR homologs is required for induced competence.\n\nAlthough S. sobrinus is typically placed among the mutans group streptococci, the S. sobrinus ComRS system is structurally and functionally similar to the competence pathways in the salivarius group. Like S. salivarius, the ComRS gene cluster in S. sobrinus includes a peptide cleavage/export gene, and the ComRS system appears coupled to a bacteriocin response system. These findings raise questions about the true phylogenetic placement of S. sobrinus.\n\nFinally, we identified two strains of S. sobrinus appear to be \"cheaters\" by either not responding to or not producing XIP. While the mechanisms of cheating could be independent, we show how a recombination event in the non-responsive strain would restore function of the ComRS pathway but delete the gene encoding XIP. Thus the S. sobrinus ComRS pathway provides a lens into the evolution of ecological cheaters.",

    "abstract": "The rapid spread of antimicrobial resistance and vaccine escape in the opportunistic human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae can be largely attributed to competence-induced transformation. To better understand the dynamics of competence-induced transformation, we studied this process at the single-cell level. We show that within isogenic populations, all cells become naturally competent and bind exogenous DNA. In addition, we find that transformation is highly efficient and that the chromosomal location of the integration site or whether the transformed gene is encoded on the leading or lagging strand has limited influence on recombination efficiency. Indeed, we have observed multiple recombination events in single recipients in real-time. However, because of saturation of the DNA uptake and integration machinery and because a single stranded donor DNA replaces the original allele, we find that transformation efficiency has an upper threshold of approximately 50% of the population. Counterintuitively, in the presence of multiple transforming DNAs, the fraction of untransformed cells increases to more than 50%. The fixed mechanism of transformation results in a fail-safe strategy for the population as half of the population generally keeps an intact copy of the original genome. Together, this work advances our understanding of pneumococcal genome plasticity.",

This study was performed in 1.5-2.0 ml microfuge tube where root inoculation approach has been used during infection under gnotobiotic condition and got completed within 2 weeks. After continuous post inoculation observation of disease progression in all nine recruited tomato cultivar, Ayush was found to be the most resistant (~15% wilting) while the Ruby tomato cultivar was found to be the most susceptible (~95% wilting) against R. solanacearum bacterial wilt. This comparative wilting and survivability study among nine different tomato cultivar under same conditions indicated that early seedling stage of tomato may be a potent and helpful tool for an easy and rapid screening of resistant tomato cultivar against R. solanacearum bacterial wilt disease at large scale level in a very economical way in terms of time, space, labor and cost. Over and above The soil and nutrients free approach presented here may be helpful for the rapid selection and development of resistant tomato cultivar and new plant protection strategies against R. solanacearum bacterial wilt disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMicrobial metabolism is highly dependent on the environmental conditions. Especially, the substrate concentration, as well as oxygen availability, determine the metabolic rates. In large-scale bioreactors, microorganisms encounter dynamic conditions in substrate and oxygen availability (mixing limitations), which influence their metabolism and subsequently their physiology. Earlier, single substrate pulse experiments were not able to explain the observed physiological changes generated under large-scale industrial fermentation conditions.\n\nResultsIn this study we applied a repetitive feast-famine regime in an aerobic Escherichia coli culture in a time-scale of seconds. The regime was applied for several generations, allowing cells to adapt to the (repetitive) dynamic environment. The observed response was highly reproducible over the cycles, indicating that cells were indeed fully adapted to the regime. We observed an increase of the specific substrate and oxygen consumption (average) rates during the feast-famine regime, compared to a steady-state (chemostat) reference environment. The increased rates at same (average) growth rate led to a reduced biomass yield (30% lower). Interestingly, this drop was not followed by increased by-product formation, pointing to the existence of energy-spilling reactions and/or less effective ATP synthesis. During the feast-famine cycle, the cells rapidly increased their uptake rate. Within 10 seconds after the beginning of the feeding, the substrate uptake rate was higher (4.68 mol/gCDW/s) than reported during batch growth (3.3 mol/gCDW/s). The high uptake led to an accumulation of several intracellular metabolites, during the feast phase, accounting for up to 34 % of the carbon supplied. Although the metabolite concentrations changed rapidly, the cellular energy charge remained unaffected, suggesting well-controlled balance between ATP producing and ATP consuming reactions. The role of inorganic polyphosphate as an energy buffer is discussed.\n\nConclusionsThe adaptation of the physiology and metabolism of Escherichia coli under substrate dynamics, representative for large-scale fermenters, revealed the existence of several cellular mechanisms coping with stress. Changes in the substrate uptake system, storage potential and energy-spilling processes resulted to be of great importance. These metabolic strategies consist a meaningful step to further tackle reduced microbial performance, observed under large-scale cultivations.",

Less understood is how LC integrity relates to brain correlates of cognition, such as brain structure. Here, we examined the relationship between cortical thickness and a measure reflecting LC integrity in older (n = 229) and younger adults (n = 67). Using a magnetic resonance imaging sequence which yields high signal intensity in the LC, we assessed the contrast between signal intensity of the LC and that of neighboring pontine reference tissue. The Freesurfer software suite was used to quantify cortical thickness. LC contrast was positively related to cortical thickness in older adults, and this association was prominent in parietal, frontal, and occipital regions. Brain regions where LC contrast was related to cortical thickness include portions of the frontoparietal network which have been implicated in noradrenergically modulated cognitive functions. These findings provide novel evidence for a link between LC structure and cortical brain structure in later adulthood.",

Natural chemicals have unique advantages in inhibiting microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and improving neuronal function. Here, we examined the effects of asperosaponin VI (ASA VI) on LPS-activated primary microglia. Microglia were isolated from mice and pretreated with different doses of ASA VI, following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. Activation and inflammatory response of microglia cells were evaluated by q-PCR, immunohistochemistry and ELISA. Signaling pathways were detected by western blotting. We found that the ASA VI inhibited the morphological expansion of microglia cells, decreased the expression and release of proinflammatory cytokines, and promoted the expression of antiinflammatory cytokines in a dose-dependent manner. ASA VI also activated PPAR-{gamma} signaling pathway in LPS-treated microglia. The anti-inflammatory effects of ASA VI in microglia were blocked by treating PPAR-{gamma} antagonist (GW9662). These results showed that ASA VI promote the transition of microglia cells from proinflammatory to anti-inflammatory by regulating PPAR-{gamma} pathway.",

    "abstract": "Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), which amplify and detect pathogen nucleic acids, are vital methods to diagnose diseases, particularly in cases where patients exhibit low levels of infection. For many blood-borne pathogens such as HIV or Plasmodium, it is necessary to first extract pathogen RNA or DNA from patient blood prior to analysis with NAATs. Traditional nucleic acid extraction methods are expensive, resource-intensive and are often difficult to deploy to resource-limited areas where many blood-borne infections are widespread. Here, we describe a portable, paper-and-plastic device for instrument-free nucleic acid extraction from whole blood, which we call SNAPflex, that builds upon our previous work extracting RNA in a 2D platform from nasopharyngeal swabs. We demonstrated improved extraction of HIV RNA from simulated patient samples compared to traditional extraction methods and long-term stability of extracted RNA without the need for cold storage. We further demonstrated successful extraction and recovery of Plasmodium falciparum DNA from simulated patient samples with superior recovery compared to existing extraction methods. The SNAPflex device extracts and purifies DNA and RNA from whole blood which can be amplified with traditional NAATs, and was designed to easily manufacture and integrate into existing health systems.",

    "abstract": "Aptamer switches that respond sensitively to local variations in pH could enable the development of molecular devices that greatly enhance diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic efficacy. Previous design strategies relied on inserting a known pH-sensitive DNA motif into the aptamer structure. Unfortunately, their performance was ultimately governed by the intrinsic pH-response of the inserted motif and could not be readily tuned to operate across arbitrary pH ranges. In this work, we present a general methodology for converting virtually any aptamer into a pH-responsive switch that can be modulated to undergo a strong change in affinity - in acidic, neutral, or alkaline conditions. This was achieved by inserting two orthogonal motifs that can be manipulated in parallel to tune sensitivity to different pH conditions without altering the core sequence of the aptamer itself. Using a single ATP aptamer, we achieve pH-dependent target binding and release under diverse pH conditions, producing as much as 1,000-fold pH-induced change in affinity. Importantly, we also demonstrate the novel capability to predictably engineer aptamer switches that only exhibit strong target affinity within a narrowly defined pH range. Our approach should offer a highly generalizable strategy for integrating pH-responsiveness into molecular devices.",

    "abstract": "Despite the key role that sex-determination plays in evolutionary processes, it is still poorly understood in many species. In salmonids, which are the best studied family of fishes, the master sex-determining gene sexually dimorphic on the Y-chromosome (sdY) has been identified. However, sdY displays unexplained discordance to the phenotypic sex, with a variable frequency of phenotypic females being reported as genetic males. Multiple sex determining loci in Atlantic salmon have also been reported, possibly as a result of transposition, suggesting a recent and non-random sex chromosome turnover in this species. We hypothesized the existence of an autosomic pseudocopy of sdY that is transmitted in accordance with Mendelian inheritance. To test this we developed a qPCR methodology to detect the number of sdY copies present in the genome. Based on the observed phenotype/genotype frequencies and linkage analysis among 2025 offspring from 64 pedigree-controlled families of accurately phenotyped Atlantic salmon, we identified both males and females carrying one or two autosomic copies in addition to the Y-specific copy present in males. Copy number frequencies were consistent with Mendelian inheritance. Pseudocopy loci were mapped to different chromosomes evidencing non-random transitions of the sex determining gene in Atlantic salmon and the existence of functional constraints for chromosome turnover.",

    "abstract": "Textures and edges contribute different information to image recognition. Edges and boundaries encode shape information, while textures manifest the appearance of regions. Despite the success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in computer vision and medical image analysis applications, predominantly only texture abstractions are learned, which often leads to imprecise boundary delineations. In medical imaging, expert manual segmentation often relies on organ boundaries; for example, to manually segment a liver, a medical practitioner usually identifies edges first and subsequently fills in the segmentation mask. Motivated by these observations, we propose a plug-and-play module, dubbed Edge-Gated CNNs (EG-CNNs), that can be used with existing encoder-decoder architectures to process both edge and texture information. The EG-CNN learns to emphasize the edges in the encoder, to predict crisp boundaries by an auxiliary edge supervision, and to fuse its output with the original CNN output. We evaluate the effectiveness of the EG-CNN with various mainstream CNNs on two publicly available datasets, BraTS 19 and KiTS 19 for brain tumor and kidney semantic segmentation. We demonstrate how the addition of EG-CNN consistently improves segmentation accuracy and generalization performance.",

In bacteria, this results in cell size homeostasis and periodicity in replication and division. The situation is perturbed under stress such as DNA damage, which induces filamentation as cell cycle progression is blocked to allow for repair. Mechanisms that release this morphological state for re-entry into wild type growth are unclear. Here we show that damage recovery is mediated via asymmetric division of Escherichia coli filaments, producing short daughter cells with wild type size and growth dynamics. Division restoration at this polar site is governed by coordinated action of divisome positioning by the Min system and modulation of division licensing by the terminus region of the chromosome, with MatP playing a central role in this process. Collectively, our study highlights a key role for concurrency between chromosome (and specifically terminus) segregation and cell division in daughter cell size maintenance during filamentous divisions and suggests a central function for asymmetric division in mediating cellular recovery from a stressed state.",

A key finding informing remodeler mechanism is the observation that the dynamics of protein residues buried within the histone core of the nucleosome are used by specific remodelers to mobilize the nucleosome1. Recently, a study obtaining cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of ISWI-family remodelernucleosome complexes failed to observe stable conformational rearrangements in the histone octamer2. The authors of this study also failed to replicate the earlier finding that site-specifically restraining histone dynamics inhibits nucleosome sliding by ISWI-family remodelers1,2. In contrast, a recent cryo-EM structure detected asymmetric histone dynamics in an ISWI-nucleosome complex3. Here, using two different protocols, we replicate the original finding in Sinha et al.1 that dynamics within the histone core are important for nucleosome sliding by the human ISWI remodeler, SNF2h. These results firmly establish histone dynamics as an essential feature of ISWI-mediated nucleosome sliding and highlight the care required in designing and performing biochemical experiments investigating nucleosome dynamics using disulfide linkages.",

    "abstract": "Toll like receptors are expressed by variety of cells, mainly immune cells and also found to have role in the tumor microenvironment. Among them, Toll like receptors-4 is found to modulate tumor progression. But definitive action of TLR4 in tumor progression is not well understood. In the present study, in breast tumor samples, expression of TLR4 was studied by immunohistochemistry method while MMP2 and MMP9 expression were studied by gelatin zymography. Kaplan Meier plotter was used to test survivability. Breast cancer cells - MCF7, MDA MB 231, T47D were studied in the presence of TLR4 lignd LPS, with the help of MTT assay, BrdU incorporation assay, scratch wound healing assay and invasion assay. Activation of TLR4 in MCF7 which is TP53 wild type has no significant effect in proliferative rate, adhesiveness and invasiveness. While in MDA-MB-231 and T47D which are TP53 mutant, there were a significant increase in adhesiveness and migratory ability, observed., TLR4 had been expressed in breast tumor of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and was found to be significantly correlated with lymph node involvement. Kaplan Meier plotter analysis revealed that high TLR4 expression might serve as an immune-protectant in invading cancer cells of TP53 wild state. It has been revealed that activation of TLR4 in breast cancer cells leads to higher expression of EMT related genes along with matrix metalloproteinases helping in migration and invasion of cells. Kaplan Meier plotter analysis revealed that TP53 wild status of the patient along with high TLR4 expression has a good overall survival of the patients.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastomas are the most lethal tumors affecting the central nervous system in adults. Simple and inexpensive syngeneic in vivo models that closely mirror human glioblastoma, including interactions between tumor and immune cells, are urgently needed for deciphering glioma biology and developing more effective treatments. Here, we generated glioblastoma cell lines by repeated in-vivo passaging of cells isolated from a neural stem cell-specific Pten/p53 double-knockout genetic mouse brain tumor model. Transcriptome and genome analyses of the cell lines revealed molecular heterogeneity comparable to that observed in human glioblastoma. Upon orthotopic transplantation into syngeneic hosts they formed high-grade gliomas that faithfully recapitulated the histopathological features, invasiveness and myeloid cell infiltration characteristic of human glioblastoma. These features make our cell lines unique and useful tools to study multiple aspects of glioblastoma pathomechanism and test novel treatments, especially immunotherapies in syngeneic preclinical models.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAltered metabolism is a hallmark of cancer and glycolysis is one of the important factors promoting tumor development. Given that the absence of multi-sample big data research about glycolysis, the molecular mechanisms involved in glycolysis or the relationships between glycolysis and tumor microenvironment are not fully studied. Thus, a more comprehensive approach in a pan-cancer landscape may be needed.\n\nMethodsHere, we develop a computational pipeline to study multi-omics molecular features defining glycolysis activity and identify molecular alterations that correlate with glycolysis. We apply a 22-gene expression signature to define the glycolysis activity landscape and verify the robustness using clinically defined glycolysis samples from several previous studies. Based on gene expression signature, we classify about 5552 of 9229 tumor samples into glycolysis score-high and score-low groups across 25 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and demonstrate their prognostic associations. Moreover, using genomes and transcriptome data, we characterize the association of copy-number aberrations (CNAs), somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and hypoxia signature with glycolysis activity.\n\nFindingsGene set variation analysis (GSVA) score by gene set expression was verified robustly to represent glycolytic activity and highly glycolytic tumors presented a poor overall survival in some cancer types. Then, we identified various types of molecular features promoting tumor cell proliferation were associated with glycolysis activity. Our study showed that TCA cycle and respiration electron transport were active in glycolysis-high tumors, indicating glycolysis was not a symptom of impaired oxidative metabolism. The glycolytic score significantly correlated with hypoxia score across all cancer types. Glycolysis score was also associated with elevated genomic instability. In all tumor types, high glycolysis tumors exhibited characteristic driver genes altered by CNAs identified multiple oncogenes and tumor suppressors. We observed widespread glycolysis-associated dysregulation of mRNA across cancers and screened out HSPA8 and P4HA1 as the potential modulating factor to glycolysis. Besides, the expression of genes encoding glycolytic enzymes positively correlated with genes in cell cycle.\n\nInterpretationThis is the first study to identify gene expression signatures that reflect glycolysis activity, which can be easily applied to large numbers of patient samples. Our analysis establishes a computational framework for characterizing glycolysis activity using gene expression data and defines correlation of glycolysis with the hypoxia microenvironment, tumor cell cycle and proliferation at a pan-cancer landscape. The findings suggest that the mechanisms whereby hypoxia influence glycolysis are likely multifactorial. Our finding is significant not just in demonstrating definition value for glycolysis but also in providing a comprehensive molecular-level understanding of glycolysis and suggesting a framework to guide combination therapy that may block the glycolysis pathway to control tumor growth in hypoxia microenvironment.",

    "abstract": "Nearly half of the classes of natural products known as ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are reliant on a protein domain called the RiPP recognition element (RRE) for peptide maturation. The RRE binds specifically to a linear precursor peptide and directs the post-translational modification enzymes to their substrate. Given its prevalence across various types of RiPP biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), the RRE could theoretically be used as a bioinformatic handle to identify novel classes of RiPPs. In addition, due to the high affinity and specificity of most RRE:precursor peptide complexes, a thorough understanding of the RRE domain could be exploited for biotechnological applications. However, sequence divergence of the RRE domain across RiPP classes has precluded automated identification of RREs based solely on sequence similarity. Here, we introduce RRE-Finder, a novel tool for identifying RRE domains with high sensitivity. RRE-Finder can be used in \"precision\" mode to confidently identify RREs in a class-specific manner or in \"exploratory\" mode, which was designed to assist in the discovery of novel RiPP classes. RRE-Finder operating in precision mode on the UniProtKB protein database retrieved over 30,000 high-confidence RREs spanning all characterized RRE-dependent RiPP classes, as well as several yet-uncharacterized RiPP, putatively novel gene cluster architectures that will require future experimental work. Finally, RRE-Finder was used in precision mode to explore a possible evolutionary origin of the RRE domain. Altogether, RRE-Finder provides a powerful new method to probe RiPP biosynthetic diversity and delivers a rich dataset of RRE sequences that will provide a foundation for deeper biochemical studies into this intriguing and versatile protein domain.",

In this study, the experimental enrichment of selected cell-types and the development of a Bayesian inference model for continuous differential transcript abundance permitted us to define the transcriptional landscape of the prostate cancer microenvironment along the disease progression axis. An important role of monocytes and macrophages in prostate cancer progression and disease recurrence was uncovered, supported by both transcriptional landscape findings and by differential tissue composition analyses. These findings were corroborated and validated by spatial analyses at the single-cell level using multiplex immunohistochemistry.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTFunctional impairment of the tumour-suppressor PTEN is common in primary-prostate cancer and has been linked to relapse post-radiotherapy (RT). Pre-clinical modelling supports elevated CXC-chemokine signaling as a critical mediator of PTEN-depleted disease progression and therapeutic resistance. We assessed the correlation of PTEN-deficiency with CXC-chemokine signaling and its association with clinical outcomes. Gene expression analysis characterized a PTENLOW/CXCR1HIGH/CXCR2HIGH cluster of tumors that associates with earlier time-to-biochemical recurrence (HR 5.87 and HR 2.65 respectively) and development of systemic metastasis (HR 3.51). In vitro, CXCL-signaling was further amplified following exposure of PTEN-deficient prostate cancer cell lines to ionizing radiation (IR). Inhibition of CXCR1/2-signaling in PTEN-depleted cell-based models increased IR-sensitivity. In vivo, administration of a CXCR1/2-targeted pepducin (x1/2pal-i3), or CXCR2-specific antagonist (AZD5069), in combination with IR to PTEN-deficient xenografts attenuated tumor growth and progression compared to control or IR alone. Post-mortem analysis confirmed that x1/2pal-i3 administration attenuated IR-induced CXCL-signaling and anti-apoptotic protein expression. Interventions targeting CXC-chemokine signaling may provide an effective strategy to combine with radiotherapy, in both locally-advanced and oligometastatic-prostate cancers, with known presence of PTEN-deficient foci.",

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic perturbations such as water overexploitation introduce novel selective pressures to the natural environments, impacting on the genomic variability of organisms and thus altering the evolutionary trajectory of its populations. Bad agricultural practices and defective policies in Cuatro Cienegas, Coahuila, Mexico, have strongly impacted its water reservoir, pushing entire hydrological systems to the brink of extinction together with their native populations. Here, we studied the effects of continuous water overexploitation on an environmental aquatic lineage of Pseudomonas otitidis, inhabitant to a particularly affected lagoon of an exhaustively studied system in the middle of the desert, over a 13 year period which encompasses three desiccation events. By comparing the genomes of a population sample from 2003 (original state) and 2015 (perturbed state), we analyzed the demographic history and evolutionary response of this bacterial lineage to the perturbation. Through coalescent simulations, we obtained a demographic model of contraction-expansion-contraction which, alongside an increment in mean Tajimas D and recombination rate, loss of genetic and nucleotidic variation and a single amino acid under positive selection, points the occurrence of an evolutionary rescue event, possibly potentiated by horizontal gene transfer, where the population nearly went extinct during the first desiccation event but sharply recovered in the second and adapted to its new environment. Furthermore, the gain of phosphorylation, DNA recombination and small-molecule metabolism and loss of biosynthetic and regulation genes on the exclusive accessory genome suggest a functional shift to a more generalist scavenger lifestyle in an environment that went from oligotrophic to nutrient-rich.",

    "abstract": "Fermented foods have been the focus of ever greater interest as a consequence of purported health benefits. Indeed, it has been suggested that the consumption of these foods that help to address the negative consequences of  industrialization of the human gut microbiota in Western society. However, as the mechanisms via which the microbes in fermented foods improve health are not understood, it is necessary to develop an understanding of the composition and functionality of the fermented food microbiota to better harness desirable traits. Here we considerably expand the understanding of fermented food microbiomes by employing shotgun metagenomic sequencing to provide a comprehensive insight into the microbial composition, diversity and functional potential (including antimicrobial resistance, carbohydrate-degrading and health-associated gene content) of a diverse range of 58 fermented foods from artisanal producers from around the Globe. Food type, i.e., dairy-, sugar- or brine-type fermented foods, was to be the primary driver of microbial composition, with dairy foods found to have the lowest microbial diversity. From the combined dataset, 127 high quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), including 10 MAGs representing putatively novel species of Acetobacter, Acidisphaera, Gluconobacter, Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc and Rouxiella, were generated. Potential health promoting attributes were more common in fermented foods than non-fermented equivalents, with waterkefirs, sauerkrauts and kvasses containing the greatest numbers of potentially health-associated gene clusters (PHAGCs). Ultimately, this study provides the most comprehensive insight into the microbiomes of fermented foods to date, and yields novel information regarding their relative health-promoting potential.\n\nImportanceFermented foods are regaining popularity in Western society due in part to an appreciation of the potential for fermented food microbiota to positively impact on health. Many previous studies have studied fermented microbiota using classical culture-based microbiological methods, older molecular techniques or, where deeper analyses have been performed, have involved a relatively small number of one specific food type. Here, we have used a state-of-the-art shotgun metagenomic approach to investigate 58 different fermented foods of different type and origin. Through this analysis, we were able to identify the differences in the microbiota across these foods, the factors that drove their microbial composition, and the relative potential functional benefits of these microbes. The information provided here will provide significant opportunities for the further optimisation of fermented food production and the harnessing of their health promoting potential.",

High-throughput sequencing technologies enable the identification of microbial indicators of digesters inhibition and can provide new insights into the key phylotypes at stake during AD process. But yet, current studies have used different inocula, substrates, geographical sites and types of reactors, resulting in indicators that are not robust or reproducible across independent studies.

We applied a recent multivariate integrative method on two-in-house studies to identify such signature, then predicted the inhibitory status of samples from two datasets with more than 90% accuracy.

Initially regarded as an indicator of cell death, filamentation is now proposed to be a transient morphological change that improves bacterial survival in hostile environments. However, the mechanism of filament recovery remains poorly characterized. Using real-time microscopy in live-cells, we analysed the fate of filamentous Escherichia coli induced by antibiotic-mediated specific inhibition of cell division, or by UV-induced DNA-damage that additionally perturbs chromosome segregation. Both filament types recover by successive and accelerated rounds of divisions, which are preferentially positioned asymmetrically at the tip of the cell by the Min system. Such division dynamics allows the rapid production of daughter cells with normal size, which DNA content depends on the progression of chromosome segregation prior to division. In most filaments, nucleoid segregation precedes tip-division, which produces nucleated daughter cells that resume normal growth. However, when segregation is deficient, tip-division occurs in the absence of DNA and produces anucleated cells. These findings uncover the mechanism by which bacterial filamentation allows efficient post-stress cell proliferation.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryBacterial filaments recover by successive, frequent and Min-dependent asymmetric tip-divisions that rapidly produce multiple daughter cells with normal size and viability",

An in-house database was constructed 26 well characterized C. deneoformans, C. neoformans and interspecies hybrids. Forty-four Cryptococcus spp. isolates were blindly identified using MALDI-TOF MS (Bruker Daltonics) and the expanded library. Their protein spectra were also submitted to hierarchical clustering and the resulting species were verified via Partial Least Squares Differential Analysis (PLS-DA) and Support-Vector Machine (SVM).\n\nResultsMALDI-TOF MS coupled with the in-house library allowed 100% correct identification of C. deneoformans and C. neoformans but misidentified the interspecies hybrids. The same level of discrimination among C. deneoformans and C. neoformans was achieved applying SVM. The application of the PLS-DA and SVM algorithms in a two-step analysis allowed 96.95% and 96.55% correct discrimination of C. neoformans from the interspecies hybrids, respectively. Besides, PCA analysis prior to SVM provided 98.45% correct discrimination of the 3 species analysed in a one-step analysis.\n\nConclusionsOur results indicate that MALDI-TOF MS could be a rapid and reliable tool for the correct discrimination of C. deneoformans and C. neoformans.

    "abstract": "Disruption of the transcription factor FoxP2, which is enriched in the basal ganglia, impair vocal development in humans and songbirds. The basal ganglia are essential for the selection and sequencing of motor actions, but the circuit mechanisms governing accurate sequencing of learned vocalizations are unknown. Here, we show expression of FoxP2 in the basal ganglia is vital for the fluent initiation and termination of birdsong, and the maintenance of song syllable sequencing in adulthood. Knockdown of FoxP2 imbalances dopamine receptor expression across striatal direct-like and indirect-like pathways, suggesting a role of dopaminergic signaling in regulating vocal-motor sequencing. Confirming this prediction, we show that phasic dopamine activation, and not inhibition, during singing drives repetition of song syllables, thus also impairing fluent initiation and termination of birdsong. These findings demonstrate discrete circuit origins for the dysfluent repetition of vocal elements, a phenotype commonly observed in speech disorders.",

    "abstract": "In the vestibular peripheral organs, type I and type II hair cells (HCs) transmit incoming signals via glutamatergic quantal transmission onto afferent nerve fibers. Additionally, type I HCs transmit via  non-quantal transmission to calyx afferent fibers, by accumulation of glutamate and potassium in the synaptic cleft. Vestibular efferent inputs originating in the brainstem contact type II HCs and vestibular afferents. Here, we aimed at characterizing the synaptic efferent inputs to type II HCs using electrical and optogenetic stimulation of efferent fibers combined with in vitro whole-cell patch clamp recording from type II HCs in the rodent vestibular crista. Properties of efferent synaptic currents in type II HCs were similar to those found in cochlear hair cells and mediated by activation of 9/10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) and SK potassium channels. While efferents showed a low probability of release at low frequencies of stimulation, repetitive stimulation resulted in facilitation and increased probability of release. Notably, the membrane potential of type II HCs measured during optogenetic stimulation of efferents showed a strong hyperpolarization even in response to single pulses and was further enhanced by repetitive stimulation. Such efferent-mediated inhibition of type II HCs can provide a mechanism to adjust the contribution of signals from type I and type II HCs to vestibular nerve fibers. As a result, the relative input of type I hair cells to vestibular afferents will be strengthened, emphasizing the phasic properties of the incoming signal that are transmitted via fast non-quantal transmission.\n\nNew and NoteworthyType II vestibular hair cells (HCs) receive inputs from efferent fibers originating in the brainstem. We used in vitro optogenetic and electrical stimulation of efferent fibers to study their synaptic inputs to type II HCs. Efferent inputs inhibited type II HCs, similar to cochlear efferent effects. We propose that efferent inputs adjust the contribution of signals from type I and type II HCs that report different components of the incoming signal to vestibular nerve fibers.",

    "abstract": "Stimulation of neural activity is an important scientific and clinical tool, causally testing hypotheses and treating neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases. However, current stimulation approaches cannot flexibly control the pattern of activity in populations of neurons. To address this, we developed an adaptive, closed-loop stimulation (ACLS) system that uses patterned, multi-site electrical stimulation to control the pattern of activity in a population of neurons. Importantly, ACLS is a learning system; it monitors the response to stimulation and iteratively updates the stimulation pattern to produce a specific neural response. In silico and in vivo experiments showed ACLS quickly learns to produce specific patterns of neural activity ([~]15 minutes) and was robust to noise and drift in neural responses. In visual cortex of awake mice, ACLS learned electrical stimulation patterns that produced responses similar to the natural response evoked by visual stimuli. Similar to how repetition of a visual stimulus causes an adaptation in the neural response, the response to electrical stimulation was adapted when it was preceded by the associated visual stimulus. Altogether, our results show ACLS can learn, in real-time, to generate specific patterns of neural activity, providing a framework for using closed-loop learning to control neural activity.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by impaired learning of culturally transmitted behaviors like social skills, speech, and language1-3. These behaviors are learned by copying parents and other social models during development, a two-stage process that involves forming memories of appropriate behaviors during social experiences and then using those memories to guide imitation. How ASD-linked genes impair these often-intertwined aspects of learning is not known, thereby limiting our understanding of the developmental progression of ASD and the targeting of therapeutic interventions. Here we show that these aspects of learning are dissociable and that the ASD-linked gene FoxP1 selectively impairs learning from social experience, but not behavioral imitation. Haploinsufficiency of FOXP1 in humans causes FOXP1 syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder typified by severe disruptions in speech and language development, and other ASD-associated symptoms4,5. We tested how knockdown of FoxP1 (FP1-KD) affects the cultural transmission of vocal behaviors in zebra finches, a songbird that learns by memorizing and vocally copying the song of an adult  song-tutor. We find that FP1-KD blocks song learning in juvenile birds by selectively impairing their ability to encode a memory during social experiences with a songtutor. These learning deficits are linked to disruptions in experience-driven structural and functional plasticity. However, if birds are exposed to tutor-song prior to FP1-KD, their ability to imitate that song during development is unaffected. Thus, FP1-KD impairs cultural transmission of vocalizations by disrupting the ability to form appropriate vocal memories, yet spares the ability to use previously acquired memories to guide vocal learning. This indicates that learning from social experience may be particularly vulnerable in FOXP1 syndrome.",

    "abstract": "The TAM receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) Mer and Axl have been implicated in liver disease, yet our understanding of their roles in liver homeostasis and injury is limited. We therefore examined the performance of Mer and Axl mutant mice during aging, and in four models of liver injury. We find that Mer and Axl are most prominently expressed in Kupffer and hepatic endothelial cells, and that as Axl-/-Mertk-/- mice normally age, they develop profound liver disease. We further find that Mer signaling is critical to the phagocytosis of apoptotic hepatocytes that are generated during acute hepatic injury, and that Mer and Axl act in concert to inhibit injury-triggered cytokine production. TAM expression in Kupffer cells is crucial for these effects. In contrast, we show that Axl is uniquely important in mitigating liver damage during acute acetaminophen intoxication. Finally, we demonstrate that Axl exacerbates the fibrosis that develops in a model of chronic hepatic injury. These divergent effects have important implications for the design and implementation of TAM-directed therapeutics that target these RTKs in the liver.",

    "abstract": "DNA polymerases have revolutionized the biotechnology field due to their ability to precisely replicate stored genetic information. Screening variants of these enzymes for unique properties gives the opportunity to identify polymerases with novel features. We have previously developed a single-molecule DNA sequencing platform by coupling a DNA polymerase to a -hemolysin pore on a nanopore array. Here, we use this approach to demonstrate a single-molecule method that enables rapid screening of polymerase variants in a multiplex manner. In this approach, barcoded DNA strands are complexed with polymerase variants and serve as templates for nanopore sequencing. Nanopore sequencing of the barcoded DNA reveals both the barcode identity and kinetic properties of the polymerase variant associated with the cognate barcode, allowing for multiplexed investigation of many polymerase variants in parallel on a single nanopore array. Further, we develop a robust classification algorithm that discriminates kinetic characteristics of the different polymerase mutants. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the utility of our approach by screening a library of ~100 polymerases to identify variants for potential applications of biotechnological interest. We anticipate our screening method to be broadly useful for applications that require polymerases with unique or altered physical properties.",

We capture the structure of LACV-L FL in two functionally relevant states, pre-initiation and elongation, that reveal large conformational changes inherent to its function. We uncover the coordinated movement of the polymerase priming loop, lid domain and C-terminal region required for the establishment of a ten-base-pair template-product RNA duplex before strand separation into respective exit tunnels.

    "abstract": "The arbovirus vectors Aedes aegypti (yellow fever mosquito) and Ae. albopictus (Asian tiger mosquito) are both common throughout the Indo-Pacific region, where 70% of global dengue transmission occurs. For Ae. aegypti all Indo-Pacific populations are invasive, having spread from an initial native range of Africa, while for Ae. albopictus the Indo-Pacific includes invasive populations and those from the native range: putatively, India to Japan to Southeast Asia. This study analyses the population genomics of 480 of these mosquitoes sampled from 27 locations in the Indo-Pacific. We investigated patterns of genome-wide genetic differentiation to compare pathways of invasion and ongoing gene flow in both species, and to compare invasive and native-range populations of Ae. albopictus. We also tested landscape genomic hypotheses that genetic differentiation would increase with geographical distance and be lower between locations with high connectivity to human transportation routes, the primary means of dispersal at these scales. We found that genetic distances were generally higher in Ae. aegypti, with Pacific populations the most highly differentiated. The most differentiated Ae. albopictus populations were in Vanuatu, Indonesia and Sri Lanka, the latter two representing potential native-range populations and potential cryptic subspeciation respectively. Genetic distances in Ae. aegypti increased with geographical distance, while in Ae. albopictus they decreased with higher connectivity to human transportation routes. Contrary to the situation in Ae. aegypti, we found evidence of long-distance Ae. albopictus colonisation events, including colonisation of Mauritius from East Asia and of Fiji from Southeast Asia. These direct genomic comparisons indicate likely differences in dispersal ecology in these species, despite their broadly sympatric distributions and similar use of human transport to disperse. Our findings will assist biosecurity operations to trace the source of invasive material and for biocontrol operations that benefit from matching genetic backgrounds of released and local populations.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe mosquitoes Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus are highly invasive and transmit dengue and other arboviruses. This study investigates the genetics of these mosquitoes in the Indo-Pacific region, where 70% of global dengue transmission occurs and where both species have established widespread invasions by hitch-hiking on human transport vessels. We compared patterns of genetic differentiation to determine the pathways these species have taken while spreading through the Indo-Pacific, and to better understand how they disperse. We sequenced DNA from 480 mosquitoes sampled from 27 locations in the Indo-Pacific, and found many genetic differences between the two species. Populations of Ae. aegypti, which is not native to the region, tended to be genetically different from each other, and populations in the Pacific Ocean were particularly divergent. Aedes albopictus populations were generally more similar to each other, though genetically different populations in Sri Lanka and Indonesia point to these having a different history to other populations. Genetic differences between Ae. aegypti populations were larger when populations were geographically distant, while differences between Ae. albopictus populations were larger when populations likely had limited access to human transportation. These results will help improve strategies for controlling these species and stopping their spread around the world.",

    "abstract": "Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is a prominent barrier to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Definitive diagnosis of GvHD is invasive and biopsies of involved tissues pose a high risk of bleeding and infection. Our previous studies in a chronic GvHD mouse model demonstrated that alloreactive CD4+ T cells are distributed to target organs ahead of overt symptoms, meanwhile CD4+ T cell activation is tied to increased glycolysis. Thus, we hypothesized that metabolic imaging of glycolysis would allow non-invasive detection of insipient GvHD in target organs infiltrated by glycolytic effector memory CD4+ T cells. We metabolically characterized CD4+ T cell subsets on day 14 post-transplant before the onset of chronic GvHD in a pre-clinical mouse model and performed 13C hyperpolarized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to quantify glycolytic activity in the liver of mice over the course of the disease. Intracellular metabolic screening and ex vivo metabolic profiling of CD4+ T cell subsets at day 14 confirmed that activated CD4+ T cells were highly glycolytic. Concurrently, hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate MRI of the liver showed high conversion of pyruvate to lactate, indicative of increased glycolytic activity, that distinguished allogeneic from syngeneic HSCT recipients prior to the development of overt chronic GvHD. Furthermore, single cell sequencing of T cells in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT indicated that similar metabolic changes may play a role in acute GvHD, providing a rationale for testing this imaging approach in the clinical post-HSCT setting. Our imaging approach is amenable to clinical translation and may allow early, non-invasive diagnosis of GvHD.",

However, very little information is available on the impact of insecticide resistance, especially metabolic resistance, on blood feeding process in mosquitoes. Here, using two recently detected DNA-based metabolic markers in the major malaria vector, An. funestus, we investigated how metabolic resistance genes could affect blood meal intake.\n\nAfter allowing both field F1 and lab F8 Anopheles funestus strains to feed on human arm for 30 minutes, we assessed the association between key parameters of blood meal process including, probing time, feeding duration, blood feeding success and blood meal size, and markers of glutathione S-transferase (L119F-GSTe2) and cytochrome P450 (CYP6P9a_R) - mediated metabolic resistance. None of the parameters of blood meal process was associated with L119F-GSTe2 genotypes. In contrast, for CYP6P9a_R, homozygote resistant mosquitoes were significantly more able to blood-feed than homozygote susceptible (OR = 3.3; CI 95%: 1.4-7.7; P =0.01) mosquitoes. Moreover, the volume of blood meal ingested by CYP6P9a-SS mosquitoes was lower than that of CYP6P9a-RS (P<0.004) and of CYP6P9a-RR (P<0.006). This suggests that CYP6P9a gene affects the feeding success and blood meal size of An. funestus. However, no correlation was found in the expression of CYP6P9a and that of genes encoding for salivary proteins involved in blood meal process.\n\nThis study suggests that P450-based metabolic resistance may increase the blood feeding ability of malaria vectors and potential impacting their vectorial capacity.",

The prevalence was highest in highlands followed by midland and then lowland. This represents a significant scabies burden which we recommend warrants health service intervention.\n\nAuthors summaryScabies, a common human skin disease with a prevalence range of 0.2% to 71.4% in the world. It can have considerable impact on general health leading to illness and death not only through direct effect of its infestation and as a result of secondary bacterial infection. Conducting a research on this neglected tropical disease would contribute in designing a policies and strategies on prevention and control measures in the study area. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of scabies and its associated factors among school age children in Arba Minch zuria district, Gamo zone, Southern Ethiopia.",

    "abstract": "Spearfishing is currently the primary approach for removing invasive Indo-Pacific lionfish (Pterois volitans/miles complex) to mitigate their impacts to western Atlantic marine ecosystems. However, a substantial portion of lionfish spawning biomass is beyond the depth limits of SCUBA. Innovative technologies may offer an alternative means to target lionfish and allow for the development of a deepwater lionfish trap fishery, but the removal efficiency and potential environmental impacts of traps have not been evaluated. We tested a collapsible non-containment trap (the  Gittings trap) near artificial reefs in the northern Gulf of Mexico. A total of 327 lionfish and 28 native fishes (4 of which regulated species) recruited to traps (i.e., number of fish observed within the trap footprint) during 82 trap sets, catching 144 lionfish and 29 native species. Lionfish recruitment was highest for single (versus paired) traps deployed <15 m from reefs with a 1-day soak time, for which mean lionfish and native species recruitment per trap were approximately 5 and 0.1, respectively. Gittings traps selected for larger lionfish (mean size 277 mm total length) compared to spearfishing (mean size 258 mm). Community impacts from Gittings traps appeared minimal given recruitment patterns and catch rates were >10X higher for lionfish versus native fishes. Gittings traps did not move on the bottom during two major storm events; however, further testing will be necessary to test trap movement with surface buoys. Additional research should also focus on design and operational modifications to improve Gittings trap deployment success (68% successfully opened on the seabed) and reduce lionfish escapement (56% escaped from traps upon retrieval). While removal efficiency for lionfish (12-24%) was far below that of spearfishing, study results demonstrate Gittings traps are suitable for future testing on deepwater natural reefs, which constitute >90% of the regions reef habitat.",

    "abstract": "Sherpa highlanders demonstrate extraordinary tolerance to hypoxia at high altitudes, partly by one of the adaptation mechanisms promoting increases of microcirculatory blood flow and capillary density at high altitude for restoring oxygen supply to tissues. Hypoxia stimulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is an important signaling protein involved in hypoxia-stimulated vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Our present study included 51 Sherpas dwelling in Namche Bazaar village (3440 m) and 76 non-Sherpa lowlanders residing in Kathmandu (1300 m) in Nepal. In these participants, we measured plasma VEGF-A concentrations and genotyped five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of VEGFA: rs699947, rs8333061, rs1570360, and rs2010963 in the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR); and rs3025039 in the 3'-UTR. The average circulating VEGF-A level in Sherpas did not respond to hypoxia at the high altitude in 3440 m, remaining equivalent to the level in non-Sherpa lowlanders at low altitude. Allele discriminations for the analyzed SNPs revealed significant genetic divergences of rs699947, rs8333061, and rs2010963 in Sherpa highlanders compared with non-Sherpa lowlanders, East Asians, South Asians, and the global population; however, consistency with the indigenous Tibetan highlanders from the Tibet Plateau. On the other hand, the SNP rs3025039 in the 3'-UTR presented constant preserved genetic variation among global populations. Our findings indicated that the physiological sea-level VEGF-A concentration in Sherpa highlanders at high altitude was probably linked with the significant variations of VEGFA in Sherpas that regulate the gene expression in a manner of tolerance to hypoxia through production of the optimal biological level of VEGF-A at high altitudes. Precise angiogenesis at high altitude contributes to the adaptive levels of capillary density and microcirculation, providing efficient and effective diffusion of oxygen to tissues and representing human adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia environment.\n\nAuthor summarySherpa highlanders demonstrate extraordinary tolerance to hypoxia at high altitudes, partly by one of the adaptation mechanisms promoting increases of microcirculatory blood flow and capillary density at high altitude for restoring oxygen supply to tissues. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is mainly stimulated by hypoxia, and is an important signaling protein involved in hypoxia-stimulated vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Interestingly, we found that the circulating VEGF-A level in Sherpa highlanders did not respond to hypoxia at high altitude. Furthermore, allele discrimination of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of VEGFA revealed significant divergences of rs699947, rs8333061, and rs2010963 within the VEGFA regulation region in Sherpa highlanders compared to the non-Sherpa lowlanders, East Asians, South Asians, and the global population; however, consistency with Tibetan highlanders from the Tibet Plateau. We propose that the hypoxia-tolerant circulating VEGF-A level in Sherpa highlanders is linked with the genetic variations of VEGFA, contributing to human adaptation to high-altitude hypoxic environments.",

    "abstract": "Variation in tissue-specific metabolism between species and among individuals is thought to be adaptively important; however, understanding this evolutionary relationship requires reliably measuring this trait in many individuals. In most higher organisms, tissue specificity is important because different organs (heart, brain, liver, muscle) have unique ecologically adaptive roles. Current technology and methodology for measuring tissue-specific metabolism is costly and limited by throughput capacity and efficiency. Presented here is the design for a flexible and cost-effective high-throughput micro-respirometer (HTMR) optimized to measure small biological samples. To verify precision and accuracy, substrate specific metabolism was measured in heart ventricles isolated from a small teleost, Fundulus heteroclitus, and in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Within the system, results were reproducible between chambers and over time with both teleost hearts and yeast. Additionally, metabolic rates and allometric scaling relationships in Fundulus agree with previously published data measured with lower-throughput equipment. This design reduces cost, but still provides an accurate measure of metabolism in small biological samples. This will allow for high-throughput measurement of tissue metabolism that can enhance understanding of the adaptive importance of complex metabolic traits.",

Upon screening the library of FDA approved drugs in breast cancer cells in vitro, the authors reported the ability of the antibiotic Sulfisoxazole (SFX) in inhibiting EV biogenesis and secretion. SFX was also effective in reducing breast primary tumor burden and blocking metastasis in immunocompromised and immunocompetent mouse models. As we seek a compound to block EV biogenesis and secretion in our current in vivo studies, we intended to use SFX and hence performed in vitro characterization as the first step. However, treatment of two cancer cells with SFX did not reduce the amount of EVs as reported by the authors.",

    "abstract": "Dominant missense mutations in the human serine protease FAM111A underlie perinatally lethal gracile bone dysplasia and Kenny-Caffey syndrome 1-3, yet how FAM111A mutations lead to disease is not known. We show that FAM111A proteolytic activity suppresses DNA replication and transcription by displacing key effectors of these processes from chromatin, triggering rapid programmed cell death by Caspase-dependent apoptosis to potently undermine cell viability. Patient-associated point mutations in FAM111A exacerbate these phenotypes by hyperactivating its intrinsic protease activity. Moreover, FAM111A forms a complex with the uncharacterized homologous serine protease FAM111B, point mutations in which cause a hereditary fibrosing poikiloderma syndrome 4, and we demonstrate that disease-associated FAM111B mutants display amplified proteolytic activity and phenocopy the cellular impact of deregulated FAM111A catalytic activity. Thus, patient-associated FAM111A and FAM111B mutations may drive multisystem disorders via a common gain-of-function mechanism that relieves inhibitory constraints on their protease activities to powerfully undermine cellular fitness.",

    "abstract": "During development, cells often undergo multiple, distinct morphogenetic processes to form a tissue or organ, but how their temporal order and time interval are determined remain poorly understood. Here we show that the nuclear receptors E75 and DHR3 regulate the temporal order and time interval between the collective migration and lumen formation of a coherent group of about 8 cells called border cells during Drosophila oogenesis. In wild type egg chambers, border cells need to first collectively migrate to the anterior border of oocyte before undergoing lumen formation to form micropyle, the structure that is essential for sperm entry into the oocyte. We show that E75 is required for border cell migration and it antagonizes the activity of DHR3, which is necessary and sufficient for the subsequent lumen formation during micropyle formation. Furthermore, E75s loss of function or DHR3 overexpression each leads to precocious lumen formation before collective migration, an incorrect temporal order for the two morphogenetic processes. Interestingly, both E75 and DHR3s levels are simultaneously elevated in response to signaling from the EcR, a steroid hormone receptor that initiates border cell migration. Subsequently, the decrease of E75 levels in response to decreased EcR signaling leads to the de-repression of DHR3s activity and hence switch-on of lumen formation, contributing to the regulation of time interval between collective migration and micropyle formation.",
