    "abstract": "BackgroundCancer cell phenotypes evolve over the course of a tumors treatment. The phenotypes that emerge and disappear over time will be specific to each drug regimen and type of cancer. Chemotherapy remains one of the most common and effective treatments for metastatic breast cancer patients; however, resistance to chemotherapy inevitably emerges. Cancer chemotherapy treatment regimens are not designed to target emerging chemo-resistance, despite its clear importance in progressive cancer. This study focuses on finding sequential treatment strategies that target acquired chemo-resistant states and optimize response to chemotherapy.\n\nMethodsIn this study, we used heterogeneous tumor samples from patients to identify subclones resistant to chemotherapy. Using flow cytometry for stem cell markers and DNA sequencing to define subclonal population changes, we measured the enrichment of cancer stem cell-like (CSL) phenotypes in subclones that survive chemotherapy. We then analyzed breast cancer patient tumor organoids and cell line acquisition of CSL traits following chemotherapy, as well as the ability of different drugs to reverse acquired resistance, using flow cytometry, mammosphere assays, and single cell RNA-sequencing analysis.\n\nResultsWe show that in progressive estrogen receptor positive (ER+) metastatic breast cancer patients, resistant tumor subclones that emerge following chemotherapy have increased CSL abundance. Further, in vitro organoid growth of ER+ patient cancer cells also shows that chemotherapy treatment leads to increased abundance of ALDH+/CD44+ CSL cells. Chemotherapy induced CSL abundance is blocked by treatment with a pan-HDAC inhibitor, belinostat. Further, belinostat treatment diminished both mammosphere formation and size following chemotherapy, also indicating a decrease in progenitor CSL traits. HDAC inhibitors specific to class IIa (HDAC4, HDAC5) and IIb (HDAC6) were shown to primarily reverse the chemo-resistant CSL state. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis with patient samples showed that HDAC targets and MYC signaling were promoted by chemotherapy and inhibited upon HDAC inhibitor treatment.\n\nConclusionThese findings indicate that HDAC inhibition can block chemotherapy-induced drug resistant phenotypes with  one-two punch strategy in refractory breast cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Endometrial cancer remains the most common gynecological malignancy in the United States. While the loss of the tumor suppressor, PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog), is well studied in endometrial cancer, recent studies suggest that DICER1, the endoribonuclease responsible for miRNA genesis, also plays a significant role in endometrial adenocarcinoma. In an endometrial adenocarcinoma mouse model, which has a conditional uterine deletion of Pten, Dicer1 was also conditionally deleted. Conditional uterine deletion of Dicer1 and Pten resulted in high-penetrance, poorly-differentiated endometrial adenocarcinomas. Poorly-differentiated endometrial adenocarcinomas expressed known markers of clear-cell adenocarcinoma, including Napsin A and HNF1B (hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 homeobox B). Adenocarcinomas were hormone-independent, and treatment with long-term progesterone did not mitigate poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma, nor did it affect adnexal metastasis. Transcriptomic analyses of uteri or Ishikawa cells with deletion of DICER1 revealed unique transcriptomic profiles and global downregulation of miRNAs. Integration of downregulated miRNAs with upregulated mRNA targets revealed deregulated let-7 and miR-16 target genes, similar to published human DICER1-mutant endometrial cancers from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas). Importantly, these miRNA-target genes, involved in ephrin-receptor and transforming growth factor-beta signaling, represent potential clinical targets for rare, yet deadly, poorly-differentiated endometrial adenocarcinomas in women. This mouse model represents poorly-differentiated endometrial adenocarcinoma and will allow for the discovery of novel mechanisms of hormone-independent endometrial adenocarcinoma from atrophic endometrium.\n\nSignificance StatementEndometrial cancer is one of the few cancers with an increasing death rate in the United States. The most significant risk factor associated with death is high tumor grade, which occurs most frequently in postmenopausal women, where it develops within an atrophic endometrium. Here, we present a mouse model with conditional deletion of Dicer1, a key enzyme in miRNA genesis, and Pten, a tumor suppressor, that develops poorly-differentiated, steroid hormone-independent, endometrial adenocarcinoma with adnexal metastasis. These high-grade adenocarcinomas develop from an atrophic endometrium and share molecular features with DICER1-mutant human endometrial adenocarcinomas. We anticipate that this preclinical model represents a move toward the discovery of novel mechanisms of hormone-independent development of endometrial adenocarcinoma from atrophic endometrium.",

    "abstract": "The Rous sarcoma virus Gag polyprotein transiently traffics through the nucleus, which is required for efficient incorporation of the viral genomic RNA (gRNA) into virus particles. Packaging of gRNA is mediated by two zinc knuckles and basic residues located in the nucleocapsid (NC) domain in Gag. To further examine the role of basic residues located downstream of the zinc knuckles in gRNA encapsidation, we used a gain-of-function approach. We replaced a basic residue cluster essential for gRNA packaging with heterologous basic residue motif (BR) with RNA binding activity from either the HIV-1 Rev protein (Rev BR) or the HSV ICP27 protein (ICP27 BR). Compared to wild type Gag, the mutant ICP27 BR and Rev BR Gag proteins were much more strongly localized to the nucleus and released significantly lower levels of virus particles. Surprisingly, both the ICP27 BR and Rev BR mutants packaged normal levels of gRNA per virus particle when examined in the context of a proviral vector, yet both mutants were noninfectious. These results support the hypothesis that basic residues located in the C-terminal region of NC are required for selective gRNA packaging, potentially via initial electrostatic interactions that facilitate specific binding.",

    "abstract": "Arachnocampa larvae utilise bioluminescence to lure small arthropod prey into their web-like silk snares. The luciferin-luciferase light-producing reaction occurs in a specialised light organ composed of Malpighian tubule cells in association with a tracheal mass. The accepted model for bioluminescence regulation is that light is actively repressed during the non-glowing period and released when glowing through the night. The model is based upon foregoing observations that carbon dioxide (CO2) - a commonly-used insect anaesthetic - produces elevated light output in whole, live larvae as well as isolated light organs. Alternative anaesthetics were reported to have a similar light-releasing effect. We set out to test this model in Arachnocampa flava larvae by exposing them to a range of anaesthetics and gas mixtures. The anaesthetics isoflurane, ethyl acetate, and diethyl ether did not produce high bioluminescence responses in the same way as CO2. Ligation and dissection experiments localised the CO2 response to the light organ rather than it being a response to general anaesthesia. Exposure to hypoxia through the introduction of nitrogen gas combined with CO2 exposures highlighted that continuity between the longitudinal tracheal trunks and the light organ tracheal mass is necessary for recovery of the CO2-induced light response. The physiological basis of the CO2-induced bioluminescence increase remains unresolved but is most likely related to access of oxygen to the photocytes. The results suggest that the repression model for bioluminescence control can be rejected. An alternative is proposed based on neural upregulation modulating bioluminescence intensity.\n\nSummary StatementCO2 was thought to act as an anaesthetic producing elevated bioluminescence in Arachnocampa. Here we show it acts directly on the light organ and does not act as an anaesthetic.",

    "abstract": "Proinflammatory conditions have long been associated with mammary carcinogenesis and breast cancer progression. The underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood but signaling of TNF through its receptors TNFR1 and TNFR2 is a major mediator of inflammation in both, obesity and in the response of tissues to radiation, two known risk factors for the development of breast cancer. Using the MMTV-Wnt1 mouse model for spontaneous breast cancer and knockout mice for TNFR1 and TNFR2 we report that loss of a TNFR2 allele leads to ductal hyperplasia in the mammary gland with increased numbers of mammary epithelial stem cell and terminal endbuds. Furthermore, that loss of one TNFR2 allele increases the incidence of breast cancers in MMTV-Wnt1 mice and results in tumors with a more aggressive phenotype and metastatic potential. The underlying mechanisms include a preferential activation of canonical NF-{kappa}B signaling pathways and autocrine production of TNF. Analysis of the TCGA dataset indicated inferior overall survival for patients with down-regulated TNFR2 expression.\n\nWe conclude, that imbalances in TNFR signaling promote the development and progression of breast cancer, indicating that selective agonists of TNFR2 could potentially modulate the risk for breast cancer in high-risk populations.\n\nSignificance StatementOver the past four decades the treatment results for patients suffering from breast cancer have constantly improved, leaving breast cancer prevention as an important frontier against the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Obesity has become a national health crisis and is a known proinflammatory risk factor for breast cancer. Our study describes a previously unknown aspect of proinflammatory signaling on breast cancer development and progression, thus suggesting novel potential targets to modulate the incidence of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Under the right conditions any drive can overcome nearly any other, yet studies of behavioural selection predominantly focus on only one, or occasionally two behaviours. We present an experimental and computational framework that captures and explains the resolution of conflicts between several competing motivations. We characterize neurons that integrate information from all rival drives to generate an aggregate signal that urges male Drosophila to transition out of mating. Experimental investigation of these Drive Integrating Neurons (DINs) revealed time-varying, supralinear interactions among competing drives that stimulate the DINs and induce a change in behaviour. Extending these findings to model the interactions between all of an animals motivations led to the surprising prediction that, under many conditions, all-to-all interactions actually buffer the dominant drive against challengers. We experimentally validated this prediction, showing that weak drives for a variety of tertiary goals can have a profound stabilizing effect on the ongoing behaviour. These results emerge only if non-linear integration of other motivations occurs for each of an animals drives, suggesting the potential universality of this mechanism. Our findings emphasize the interconnectedness of motivational systems and the consequent importance of considering the full motivational state of an animal to understand its behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation can have profound effects on the physicochemical and biological properties of proteins. However, high-throughput and systematic approaches have not yet been developed to assess the effects of specific modification types and sites on protein lifetime, which represents a key parameter for understanding signaling rewiring and drug development. Here we describe a proteomic method, DeltaSILAC, to quantify the impact of site-specific phosphorylation on the endurance of thousands of proteins in live cells. Being configured on the reproducible data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS), the pulse labeling approach using stable isotope-labeled amino acids in cells (SILAC), together with a novel peptide-level matching strategy, this multiplexed assay revealed the global delaying effect of phosphorylation on protein turnover in growing cancer cells. Further, we identified local sequence and structural features in proximity to the phosphorylated sites that could be associated with protein endurance alterations. We found that phosphorylated sites accelerating protein turnover are functionally selected for cell fitness and evolutionarily conserved. DeltaSILAC provides a generalizable approach for prioritizing the effects of phosphorylation sites on protein lifetime in the context of cell signaling and disease biology, which is highly complementary to existing methods. Finally, DeltaSILAC is widely applicable to diverse post-translational modification types and different cell systems.",

    "abstract": "A muscles structure, or architecture, is indicative of its function and is plastic; changes in input to or use of the muscle alter its architecture. Stroke-induced neural deficits substantially alter both input to and usage of individual muscles. Here, we combined novel in vivo imaging methods (second harmonic generation microendoscopy, extended field-of-view ultrasound, and fat-supression MRI) to quantify functionally meaningful muscle architecture parameters in the biceps brachii of both limbs of individuals with chronic hemiparetic stroke and in age-matched, unimpaired controls. Specifically, serial sarcomere number and physiological cross-sectional area were calculated from data collected at three anatomical scales: sarcomere length, fascicle length, and muscle volume. Our data indicate that the paretic biceps brachii had ~8,500 fewer serial sarcomeres compared to the contralateral limb (p=0.0044). In the single joint posture tested, the decreased serial sarcomere number was manifested by significantly shorter fascicles (10.7cm vs 13.6cm; p<0.0001) without significant differences in sarcomere lengths (3.58m vs. 3.54m; p=0.6787) in the paretic compared to the contralateral biceps. No interlimb differences were observed in unimpaired controls, suggesting we observed muscle adaptations associated with stroke rather than natural interlimb variability. This study provides the first direct evidence of the loss of serial sarcomeres in human muscle, observed in a population with neural impairments that lead to disuse and chronically place the affected muscle at a shortened position. This adaptation is consistent with functional consequences (increased passive resistance to elbow extension) that would amplify already problematic, neurally driven motor impairments.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSerial sarcomere number determines a muscles length during maximum force production and its available length range for active force generation. Skeletal muscle length adapts to functional demands; for example, animal studies demonstrate that chronically shortened muscles decrease length by losing serial sarcomeres. This phenomenon has never been demonstrated in humans. Integrating multi-scale imaging techniques, including two photon microendoscopy, an innovative advance from traditional, invasive measurement methods at the sarcomere scale, we establish that chronic impairments that place a muscle in a shortened position are associated with the loss of serial sarcomeres in humans. Understanding how muscle adapts following impairment is critical to the design of more effective clinical interventions to mitigate such adaptations and to improve function following motor impairments.",

    "abstract": "HIF-1-mediated adaptation to changes in oxygen availability is a critical aspect of healthy physiology. HIF is regulated by a conserved mechanism whereby EGLN/PHD family members hydroxylate HIF in an oxygen-dependent manner, targeting it for ubiquitination by Von-Hippel-Lindau (VHL) family members, leading to its proteasomal degradation. The activity of the only C. elegans PHD family member, EGL-9, is also regulated by a hydrogen sulfide sensing cysteine-synthetase-like protein, CYSL-1, which is, in turn, regulated by RHY-1/acyltransferase. Over the last decade multiple seminal studies have established a role for the hypoxic response in regulating longevity, with mutations in vhl-1 substantially extending C. elegans lifespan through a HIF-1-dependent mechanism. However, studies on other components of the hypoxic signaling pathway that similarly stabilize HIF-1 have shown more mixed results, suggesting that mutations in egl-9 and rhy-1 frequently fail to extend lifespan. Here, we show that egl-9 and rhy-1 mutants suppress the long-lived phenotype of vhl-1 mutants. We also show that RNAi of rhy-1 extends lifespan of wild-type worms while decreasing lifespan of vhl-1 mutant worms. We further identify VHL-1-independent gene expression changes mediated by EGL-9 and RHY-1 and find that a subset of these genes contributes to longevity regulation. The resulting data suggest that changes in HIF-1 activity derived by interactions with EGL-9 likely contribute greatly to its role in regulation of longevity.",

In striatal neurons, the D1R activates cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signalling. However, in Parkinsons disease (PD), alterations in this pathway lead to activation of extracellular regulated kinases (ERK1/2), contributing to L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). In order to detect D1R activation in vivo and to study the progressive dysregulation of D1R signalling in PD and LID, we developed ratiometric fiber-photometry with Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensors and optically detected PKA and ERK1/2 signalling in freely moving rats. We show that in Parkinsonian animals, D1R signalling through PKA and ERK1/2 is sensitized, but that following chronic treatment with L-DOPA, these pathways become partially desensitized while concurrently D1R activation leads to greater induction of dyskinesia.",

The lack of data on many plants, however, limits our understanding of their potential and the possibility of building a research agenda focused on them. Our objective with this systematic review was to identify biodiverse food plants occurring in the Caatinga biome, Brazil, strategic for the promotion of food and nutrition security. We selected studies from the following databases: Web of Science, Medline/PubMed (via the National Library of Medicine), Scopus and Embrapa Agricultural Research Databases (BDPA). Eligible were original articles, published since 2008, studying food plants occurring in the Caatinga. We assessed the methodological quality of the studies we selected. We reviewed a total of fifteen studies in which 65 plants that met our inclusion criteria were mentioned. Of this amount, 17 species, including varieties, subspecies, and different parts of plants, had data on chemical composition, in addition to being mentioned as food consumed by rural communities in observational ethnobotanical studies. From the energy and protein data associated with these plants, we produced a ranking of strategic species. The plants with values higher than the average of the set were: Dioclea grandiflora Mart. ex Benth (mucuna), Hymenaea courbaril L. (jatoba), Syagrus cearensis Noblick (coco-catole), Libidibia ferrea (Mart. ex Tul.) L.P.Queiroz (juca), Sideroxylon obtusifolium (Roem. & Schult.) T.D.Penn. (quixabeira).

KIIs and FGDs guides were structured to enlist responses around case finding techniques, linkage to services and TT surgery process.\n\nConclusionWe found a substantial proportion (13%) of TT positive people were not being identified by case finders, and of those identified, majority (72%) were lost along the continuum of care. These factors likely contribute to high TT prevalence in districts where surgical interventions are ongoing. Engaging community leaders to share TT information and enlisting people who have received surgery to witness in communities may encourage consent of examination by case finders and increase surgical uptake. After witnessing positive effects of surgery, many interviewees who had previously declined surgery changed their mind. Increasing frequency of surgical camps would improve access to these populations. Additionally, giving more notice about surgical camps and extending duration is important to enable remote populations to obtain services.\n\nAuthor SummaryTreatment for trachomatous trichiasis (TT) includes epilation or surgery. There are several districts in Tanzania that have struggled to link people with TT to services. It is important for the program to understand why this is the case to inform program adaptations for improved linkage to services. We implemented a mixed methods approach to address this knowledge gap. We found a large portion of TT positive people are not being identified by case finders and of those identified, many are lost along the continuum of care. These factors are likely contributing to the unexpectedly high TT prevalence in districts where surgical interventions are ongoing. Barriers to identifying cases included remoteness, case finder credibility, knowledge of TT, and case finder motivation. Once cases are identified, the largest gap along the continuum of care is the link between being identified and screened. We found barriers to attending screenings and subsequently obtaining treatment to be fear of surgery, distance from surgical camps, agricultural season, time to plan, awareness and frequency of camps, and lack of assistance after surgery.",

    "abstract": "In Colombia, little is known on the distribution of the Asian mosquito Aedes albopictus, main vector of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in Asia and Oceania. Therefore, this work set out to estimate its current and future potential geographic distribution under the Representative Concentration Paths (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5 emission scenarios by 2050 and 2070, using ecological niche models. For this, predictions were made in MaxEnt, employing occurrences of A. albopictus from their native area and South America and bioclimatic variables of these places. It was found that, since its invasion to Colombia, A. albopictus is present in 47% of the country, in peri-urban (20%), rural (23%), and urban (57%) areas between 0 and 1800 m, with Antioquia and Valle del Cauca being the departments with the most registries. The current estimation suggests that A. albopictus is distributed in 96% of the territory up to 3000 m (p < 0.001). Additionally, by 2050 and 2070, below RCP 2.6, its distribution could diminish to nearly 90% including altitudes of 3100 m, while below RCP 8.5 it would be < 60% increasing its distribution up to 3200 m. These results suggest that, currently in Colombia, A. albopictus is found throughout the country and climate change could diminish eventually its area of distribution, but increase its altitudinal range. In Colombia, surveillance and vector control programs must focus their attention on this vector to avoid complications in the national public health setting.",

    "abstract": "As one of the main groups composing marine zooplankton, copepods play an important role due to the position they occupy in the trophic web. Study of their biomass and relationship with the physical conditions of the water column are essential in order to evaluate the trophic structure and functions of any aquatic ecosystem. As a contribution to this topic, we assessed the copepod biomass inside a cyclonic eddy system during two different seasons in the Bay of La Paz in the southern Gulf of California, a region characterized by high biological productivity. Two oceanographic expeditions took place in the winter of 2006 and summer of 2009 on which a conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) probe was used to determine the physical structure of the water column and oblique zooplankton hauls collected zooplankton samples. Satellite data were used to visualize chlorophyll-a distribution patterns. The results showed the presence of a well-defined mesoscale cyclonic eddy in both seasons, with high chlorophyll-a (CHLA) values at the edges of the eddy. Maximum values for copepod biomass were observed in winter and their distribution corresponded well with the circulation pattern and the CHLA values, forming a belt shape following the periphery of the eddy. The results presented herein highlight the impact of the mesoscale eddy on the planktonic ecosystem through its influence on hydrographic conditions in the water column. Other factors, such as ecological interactions, population dynamics, and feeding habits may play a role as well. Feeding behavior in particular is affected by high CHLA concentrations observed around the eddy which represent a source of food for these organisms.",

We calculated the pooled Kappa index. Ten studies that met all inclusion criteria were included in this meta-analysis. A total of 608 carotid plaques were assessed through both SMI and CEUS. The pooled summary Kappa index was 0.743(95 % CI=0.696-0.790) with statistical significance(z= 31.14, p<0.01). We found no evidence for publication bias (t=-1.21, p=0.261). Our meta-analysis indicates that SMI and CEUS display a good consistency in detecting IPN of carotid plaque, that is to say SMI ultrasound maybe a promising alternative to CEUS for detecting IPN of carotid plaque.",

    "abstract": "Malaria cases in Latin America reached ~1 million in 2017 and 2018, with 53% and 51% reported from Venezuela, respectively. In this study, we characterized the spatiotemporal dynamics of malaria transmission between 2007-2017 in southern Venezuela, the main endemic area of the country. We found that disease transmission was focal and more prevalent in the southeast of southern Venezuela where two persistent hotspots of Plasmodium vivax (76%) and P. falciparum (18%) linked to deforestation for illegal gold mining accounted for ~60% of the country-wide number of cases. Incidence has increased nearly tenfold in the last decade, showing an explosive epidemic growth due to a significant lack of disease control. We suggest that a source-sink pattern of Plasmodium sp. dispersal account for the re-emergence and progression of malaria transmission in the last 4 years across the country due to the internal migration of infected people to and from the hotspots and other malaria-prone ecosystems. We observe a similar pattern explaining the spillover of cases across international borders affecting neighboring countries. This study provides baseline epidemiological data and guidance for malaria control to further assess the dynamics of cross-border malaria, the role of asymptomatic carriers, drug-resistant evolution, and innovative control efforts in the Latin America region.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) of the African trypanosomes is the major membrane protein of the plasma membrane of the bloodstream stage of the parasite. African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in animals) is caused by the systemic infection of the host by several sub-species of the extracellular haemoflagellate protozoa under genus Trypanosoma. As a defense barrier against the host immune response, the entire surface of the bloodstream form of trypanosome is covered with densely packed molecules of VSG that determines the antigenic phenotype of the parasite. Variant surface glycoprotein has a C-terminal domain that is highly conserved in various species of trypanosomes.\n\nMethodsThe membrane bound VSG (VSGm) protein was prepared without denaturing the homologous region and by including numerous variable antigen types from Trypanosoma brucei brucei parasites. The purified VSGm native trypanosome protein was used to produce anti-VSGm immune sera in rabbits. The indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was used to detect trypanosomes from mice blood, artificial culture media and cattle histological sections.\n\nResultsThe resultant immune sera were able to detect different strains and species of African trypanosomes from in vivo and in situ sources after immunostaining. Anti-VSGm antibodies also demonstrated a unique property to locate trypanosomes within the histological tissues even after the trypanosomes morphology had been distorted.\n\nConclusionThe produced immune sera can be utilized for immunohistochemistry to detect Trypanosoma species in various fluids and tissues.\n\nAuthor summary",

    "abstract": "PurposeThe purpose of the current study was to determine whether older patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) who received surgical treatment had a better cause-specific survival (CSS) than patients who were recommended surgery, but declined, and whether patients who underwent post-operative RAI-131 therapy had an impact on CSS based on TNM staging and number of lymph node metastases for all total or near-total thyroidectomy patients.\n\nPatients and MethodsAll DTC patients information were obtained from the SEER*Stat 8.3.6 program, and only patients [&ge;] 60 years or older were considered. The patients were divided into two groups (underwent surgery and surgery recommend, but not performed). Furthermore, patients were grouped as follows: T4; N1b; M1; T1-3N0-1a; specific number of lymph node metastases; and total or near-total thyroidectomy.\n\nResultsThe 120-month cause-specific survival (CSS) rate of females and males showed a gradual declining trend from 60-64 to [&ge;]80 years of age in the group that underwent surgery. The CSS rate of females and males showed a marked downward and irregular trend with an increase in age in the recommended, but no surgery group. Univariate analysis indicated that the surgery group had a higher 120-month CSS in females in most stages and males, compared with the no surgery group. RAI-131 therapy was associated with an improved 80-month CSS in T4/N1b/M1 females (P<0.0183) and males (P<0.0011). There was no CSS difference in females or males between the T1-3N0 and T1-3N1a patients. There was no statistical difference between the two subgroups.\n\nConclusionsSurgical treatment should be recommended for elderly DTC patients because surgery can lead to a better CSS. High-risk patients achieve a higher benefit-to-risk ratio with RAI-131 therapy. To avoid the adverse effects associated with RAI-131 therapy, a multidisciplinary discussion should be arranged for intermediate- and low-risk patients.",
