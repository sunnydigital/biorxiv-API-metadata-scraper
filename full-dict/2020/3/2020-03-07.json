    "abstract": "MotivationMethods for analyzing microbiome data generally fall into one of two groups: tests of the global hypothesis of any microbiome effect, which do not provide any information on the contribution of individual operational taxonomic units (OTUs); and tests for individual OTUs, which do not typically provide a global test of microbiome effect. Without a unified approach, the findings of a global test may be hard to resolve with the findings at the individual OTU level. Further, many tests of individual OTU effects do not preserve the false discovery rate (FDR).\n\nResultsWe introduce the linear decomposition model (LDM), that provides a single analysis path that includes global tests of any effect of the microbiome, tests of the effects of individual OTUs while accounting for multiple testing by controlling the FDR, and a connection to distance-based ordination. The LDM accommodates both continuous and discrete variables (e.g., clinical outcomes, environmental factors) as well as interaction terms to be tested either singly or in combination, allows for adjustment of confounding covariates, and uses permutation-based p-values that can control for correlation. The LDM can also be applied to transformed data, and an \"omnibus\" test can easily combine results from analyses conducted on different transformation scales. We also provide a new implementation of PERMANOVA based on our approach. For global testing, our simulations indicate the LDM provided correct type I error and can have comparable power to existing distance-based methods. For testing individual OTUs, our simulations indicate the LDM controlled the FDR well. In contrast, DESeq2 often had inflated FDR; MetagenomeSeq generally had the lowest sensitivity. The flexibility of the LDM for a variety of microbiome studies is illustrated by the analysis of data from two microbiome studies. We also show that our implementation of PERMANOVA can outperform existing implementations.",

    "abstract": "The selection of appropriate cancer models is a key prerequisite for maximising translational potential and clinical relevance of in-vitro oncology studies.\n\nWe developed CELLector: a computational method (implemented in an open source R Shiny application and R package) allowing researchers to select the most relevant cancer cell lines in a patient-genomic guided fashion. CELLector leverages tumour genomics data to identify recurrent sub-types with associated genomic signatures. It then evaluates these signatures in cancer cell lines to rank them and prioritise their selection. This enables users to choose appropriate models for inclusion/exclusion in retrospective analyses and future studies. Moreover this allows bridging data from cancer cell line screens to precisely defined sub-cohorts of primary tumours. Here, we demonstrate usefulness and applicability of our method through example use cases, showing how it can be used to prioritise the development of new in-vitro models and to effectively unveil patient-derived multivariate prognostic and therapeutic markers.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=161 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/275032v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (41K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11f46b1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5a207aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10a57edorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12b332_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Meiotic recombination in most mammals requires recombination hotspot activation through the action of the histone 3 lysine-4 and lysine-36 methyltransferase PRDM9 to ensure successful double-strand break initiation and repair. Here we show that EWSR1, a protein whose role in meiosis was not previously clarified in detail, binds to both PRDM9 and pREC8, a phosphorylated meiosis-specific cohesin, in male meiotic cells. We created a Ewsr1 conditional knockout mouse models to deplete EWSR1 before the onset of meiosis, and found that absence of EWSR1 causes meiotic arrest with decreased histone trimethylation at meiotic hotspots, impaired DNA double-strand break repair, and reduced crossover number. Our results demonstrate that EWSR1 is essential for promoting PRDM9-dependent histone methylation and normal meiotic progress, possibly by facilitating the linking between PRDM9-bound hotspots and the nascent chromosome axis.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn most mammals, including humans and mice, genetic recombination initiates when the meiosis-specific protein PRDM9 binds specific DNA sequences, known as hotspots, at the beginning of the extended prophase I of meiosis, and activates them by trimethylating histone 3 at lysine-4 and lysine-36 on nearby nucleosomes. Although this activation of hotspots is believed to occur on the chromatin loops, the subsequent double-strand break formation and repair occur on a proteinaceous structure known as the chromosome axis. We now show that Ewing sarcoma RNA binding protein 1 (EWSR1) is a key player in early recombination events, binding to PRDM9, promoting PRDM9-dependent histone methylation, and facilitating the linking between PRDM9-bound hotspots and the nascent chromosome axis through the meiosis-specific cohesion REC8. As a result of these activities, EWSR1 assures sufficient numbers of properly positioned crossovers in each meiosis.",

    "abstract": "While in biofilms bacteria are embedded into an extracellular matrix which forms inaccessible barrier for antimicrobials thereby drastically increasing the concentrations of antibiotics required for treatment. Here we show that the susceptibility of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa to antibiotics in mixed biofilms significantly differs from monoculture biofilms depending on both conditions and chosen antimicrobial agents. While S. aureus could completely avoid vancomycin, ampicillin and ceftriaxone by embedding into the biofilm of P. aeruginosa, the very same consortium was characterized by 10-fold increase in susceptibility to broad-spectrum antimicrobials like ciprofloxacin and aminoglycosides compared to monocultures. These data clearly indicate that efficient treatment of biofilm-associated mixed infections requires antimicrobials active against both pathogens, since the interbacterial antagonism would enhance the efficacy of treatment. Moreover, similar increase in antibiotics efficacy was observed when P. aeruginosa suspension was added to the mature S. aureus biofilm, compared to S. aureus monoculture, and vice versa. These findings open promising perspectives to increase the antimicrobial treatment efficacy of the wounds infected with nosocomial pathogens by the transplantation of the skin residential microflora.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic double-strand breaks (DSBs) are generated by the evolutionarily conserved SPO11 complex in the context of chromatin loops that are organized along axial elements (AEs) of chromosomes. However, how DSBs are formed with respect to chromosome axes and the SPO11 complex remains unclear in plants. Here, we confirm that DSB and bivalent formation are defective in maize spo11-1 mutants. Super-resolution microscopy demonstrates dynamic localization of SPO11-1 during recombination initiation, with variable numbers of SPO11-1 foci being distributed in nuclei but similar numbers of SPO11-1 foci being found on AEs. Notably, cytological analysis of spo11-1 meiocytes revealed an aberrant AE structure. At leptotene, AEs of wild-type and spo11-1 meiocytes were similarly curly and discontinuous. However, during early zygotene, wild-type AEs become uniform and exhibit shortened axes, whereas the elongated and curly AEs persisted in spo11-1 mutants, suggesting that loss of SPO11-1 compromised AE structural maturation. Our results reveal an interesting relationship between SPO11-1 loading onto AEs and the conformational remodeling of AEs during recombination initiation.\n\nAuthor SummaryMeiosis is essential during sexual reproduction to produce haploid gametes. Recombination is the most crucial step during meiotic prophase I. It enables pairing of homologous chromosomes prior to their reductional division and generates new combinations of genetic alleles for transmission to the next generation. Meiotic recombination is initiated by generating DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) via SPO11, a topoisomerase-related enzyme. The activity, timing and location of this DSB machinery must be controlled precisely, but how this is achieved remains obscure. Here, we show dynamic localization of SPO11-1 on chromatin during meiotic initiation in maize, yet a similar number of SPO11-1 is able to load onto axial elements (AEs), which accompanies a structural change of the AEs of wild-type meiotic chromosomes. Interestingly, loss of SPO11-1 not only affects DSB formation but also impairs structural alterations of AEs, resulting in abnormally long and curly AEs during early meiosis. Our study provides new insights into SPO11-1 localization during recombination initiation and suggests an intimate relationship between DSB formation and AE structural changes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDespite being a lifesaving intervention for the most critically ill and circulatory compromised patients, veno-arterial extra-corporeal life support (VA-ECLS) is associated with a mortality rate of nearly 60%. Understanding how the immune response to VA-ECLS either promotes or impedes survival would both enhance risk stratification and uncover new therapeutic strategies for these patients. However, conventional enumeration of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and their subsets have failed to identify determinants of outcome among these cells.\n\nMethodsFlow cytometry and plasma cytokine measurement was combined with single cell RNASeq analysis of PBMCs from patients in circulatory shock being started on VA-ECLS to identify clinical, laboratory, and cellular features associated with 72 hour survival.\n\nResultsNon-surviving patients exhibited higher plasma levels of the tissue aggressive inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, IL-12 and TNF-. Distribution of cells between conventional PBMC subtypes was not predictive of survival. Single cell RNASeq analysis of discriminatory markers within each PBMC subtype revealed that the proportion of CD8+ Natural Killer T-cells (NKT) that expressed CD52, a known immune-modulator, was associated with improved survival. This cell population correlated inversely with IL-6 production. CD8+/CD52+ NKT cells were quantified by flow cytometry in a second, validation cohort. Those patients with a high proportion of CD52+ cells among all CD8+ NKT cells had more severe disease relative to the low CD52+ group, but nevertheless were nearly 5 time less likely to die in the first 72 hours of VA-ECLS (p=0.043 by log rank test).\n\nConclusionsCD8+/CD52+ NKT cells are associated with survival in patients undergoing VA-ECLS. Fluidics based scRNASeq can reveal important aspects of pathophysiology in complex disease states such as circulatory collapse and VA-ECLS. Further studies in animal models will be required to determine if stimulation of CD8+/CD52+ NKT cell expansion may be an effective therapeutic strategy in this patient population.",

    "abstract": "Unicellular organisms have the prevalent challenge to survive under oxidative stress of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). ROS are present as by-products of photosynthesis and aerobic respiration. These reactive species are even employed by multicellular organisms as potent weapons against microbes. Although bacterial defences against lethal and sub-lethal oxidative stress have been studied in model bacteria, the role of fluctuating H2O2 concentrations remains unexplored. It is known that sub-lethal exposure of Escherichia coli to H2O2 results in enhanced survival upon subsequent exposure. Here we investigate the priming response to H2O2 at physiological concentrations. The basis and the duration of the response (memory) were also determined by time-lapse quantitative proteomics. We found that a low level of H2O2 induced several scavenging enzymes showing a long half-life, subsequently protecting cells from future exposure. We then asked if the phenotypic resistance against H2O2 alters the evolution of resistance against oxygen stress. Experimental evolution of H2O2 resistance revealed faster evolution and higher levels of resistance in primed cells. Several mutations were found to be associated with resistance in evolved populations affecting different loci but, counterintuitively, none of them was directly associated with scavenging systems. Our results have important implications for host colonisation and infections where microbes often encounter reactive oxygen species in gradients.",

We generated the first stable zebrafish (Danio rerio) models of DM-associated MBNL loss of function through mutation of the three zebrafish mbnl genes. In contrast to mouse models, zebrafish double and triple homozygous mbnl mutants were viable to adulthood. Zebrafish mbnl mutants displayed disease-relevant physical phenotypes including decreased body size and impaired movement. They also exhibited widespread alternative splicing changes, including the misregulation of many DM-relevant exons. Physical and molecular phenotypes were more severe in compound mbnl mutants than in single mbnl mutants, suggesting partially redundant functions of Mbnl proteins. The high fecundity and larval optical transparency of this complete series of zebrafish mbnl mutants will make them useful for studying DM-related phenotypes and how individual Mbnl proteins contribute to them, and for testing potential therapeutics.",

We reveal that DA release in mouse dorsolateral striatum, but not nucleus accumbens core, is governed by GAT-1 and GAT-3. These GATs are partly localized to astrocytes, and are enriched in dorsolateral striatum compared to accumbens core. In a mouse model of early parkinsonism, GATs were downregulated and tonic GABAergic inhibition of DA release augmented, with corresponding attenuation of GABA co-release from dopaminergic axons. These data define previously unappreciated and important roles for GATs and astrocytes in determining DA release in striatum, and reveal a maladaptive plasticity in early parkinsonism that impairs DA output in vulnerable striatal regions.\n\nHighlightsO_LIGABA transporters set the level of GABA inhibition of DA output in dorsal striatum\nC_LIO_LIAstrocytes facilitate DA release levels by limiting tonic GABA inhibition\nC_LIO_LITonic inhibition of DA release is augmented in a mouse model of early parkinsonism\nC_LIO_LIDA and GABA co-release are reduced in a mouse model of early parkinsonism\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "During immature stages, adult-born neurons pass through critical periods for survival and plasticity. It is generally assumed that by 2 months of age adult-born neurons are mature and equivalent to the broader neuronal population, raising questions of how they might contribute to hippocampal function in old age when neurogenesis has declined. However, few have examined adult-born neurons beyond the critical period, or directly compared them to neurons born in infancy. Here, we used a retrovirus to visualize functionally-relevant morphological features of 2- to 24-week-old adult-born neurons in male rats. From 2-7 weeks neurons grew and attained a relatively mature phenotype. However, several features of 7-week-old neurons suggested a later wave of growth: these neurons had larger nuclei, thicker dendrites and more dendritic filopodia than all other groups. Indeed, between 7-24 weeks, adult-born neurons gained additional dendritic branches, grew a 2nd primary dendrite, acquired more mushroom spines and had enlarged mossy fiber presynaptic terminals. Compared to neonatally-born neurons, old adult-born neurons had greater spine density, larger presynaptic terminals, and more putative efferent filopodial contacts onto inhibitory neurons. By integrating rates of cell birth and growth across the lifespan, we estimate that adult neurogenesis ultimately produces half of the cells and the majority of spines in the dentate gyrus. Critically, protracted development contributes to the plasticity of the hippocampus through to the end of life, even after cell production declines. Persistent differences from neonatally-born neurons may additionally endow adult-born neurons with unique functions even after they have matured.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTNeurogenesis occurs in the hippocampus throughout adult life and contributes to memory and emotion. It is generally assumed that new neurons have the greatest impact on behavior when they are immature and plastic. However, since neurogenesis declines dramatically with age, it is unclear how they might contribute to behavior later in life when cell proliferation has slowed. Here we find that newborn neurons mature over many months in rats, and end up with distinct morphological features compared to neurons born in infancy. Using a mathematical model, we estimate that a large fraction of neurons is added in adulthood. Moreover, their extended growth produces a reserve of plasticity that persists even after neurogenesis has declined to low rates.",

    "abstract": "Infection with a single influenza A virus (IAV) is only rarely sufficient to initiate productive infection. Here, we exploit both single-cell approaches and whole-animal systems to show that IAV reliance on multiple infection can form an important species barrier to infection. Namely, we find that H9N2 subtype viruses representative of those circulating widely at the poultry-human interface exhibit acute dependence on collective interactions in mammalian systems. This need for multiple infection is greatly reduced in the natural host. Quantification of incomplete viral genomes showed that their complementation accounts for the more moderate reliance on coinfection seen in avian cells, but not the added reliance seen in mammalian cells. This finding suggests an additional form of virus-virus interaction is needed to support infection in mammalian cells. Genetic mapping implicated the PA gene segment as a major driver of this phenotype and quantification of viral RNA synthesis indicated that both replication and transcription were affected. These findings indicate that multiple distinct mechanisms underlie IAV reliance on multiple infection and underscore the importance of virus-virus interactions in IAV infection, evolution and emergence.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression control based on CRISPRi (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference) has emerged as a powerful tool for creating synthetic gene circuits, both in prokaryotes and in eukaryotes; yet, its lack of cooperativity has been pointed out as a potential obstacle for dynamic or multistable circuit construction. Here we use CRISPRi to build prominent synthetic gene circuits in Escherichia coli. We report the first-ever CRISPRi oscillator (\"CRISPRlator\"), bistable network (toggle switch) and stripe pattern-forming incoherent feed-forward loop (IFFL). Our circuit designs, conceived to feature high predictability and orthogonality, as well as low metabolic burden and context-dependency, allowed us to achieve robust circuit behaviors. Mathematical modeling suggests that unspecific binding in CRISPRi is essential to establish multistability. Our work demonstrates the wide applicability of CRISPRi in synthetic circuits and paves the way for future efforts towards engineering more complex synthetic networks, boosted by the advantages of CRISPR technology.",

    "abstract": "The developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) aims to create a detailed 4-dimensional connectome of early life spanning 20 to 45 weeks post-menstrual age. This is being achieved through the acquisition of multi-modal MRI data from over 1000 in- and ex-utero subjects combined with the development of optimised pre-processing pipelines. In this paper we present an automated and robust pipeline to minimally pre-process highly confounded neonatal resting-state fMRI data, robustly, with low failure rates and high quality-assurance. The pipeline has been designed to specifically address the challenges that neonatal data presents including low and variable contrast and high levels of head motion. We provide a detailed description and evaluation of the pipeline which includes integrated slice-to-volume motion correction and dynamic susceptibility distortion correction, a robust multimodal registration approach, bespoke ICA-based denoising, and an automated QC framework. We assess these components on a large cohort of dHCP subjects and demonstrate that processing refinements integrated into the pipeline provide substantial reduction in movement related distortions, resulting in significant improvements in SNR, and detection of high quality RSNs from neonates.\n\nHighlightsO_LIAn automated and robust pipeline to minimally pre-process highly confounded neonatal fMRI data\nC_LIO_LIIncludes integrated dynamic distortion and slice-to-volume motion correction\nC_LIO_LIA robust multimodal registration approach which includes custom neonatal templates\nC_LIO_LIIncorporates an automated and self-reporting QC framework to quantify data quality and identify issues for further inspection\nC_LIO_LIData analysis of 538 infants imaged at 26-45 weeks post-menstrual age\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Studying naturalistic behavior remains a prohibitively difficult objective. Recent machine learning advances have enabled limb localization. Extracting behaviors, however, requires ascertaining the spatiotemporal patterns of these positions. To provide the missing bridge from poses to actions and their kinematics, we developed B-SOiD - an open-source, unsupervised algorithm that identifies behavior without user bias. By training a machine classifier on pose pattern statistics clustered using new methods, our approach achieves greatly improved processing speed and the ability to generalize across subjects or labs. Using a frameshift alignment paradigm, B-SOiD overcomes previous temporal resolution barriers that prevent the use of other algorithms with electrophysiological recordings. Using only a single, off-the-shelf camera, B-SOiD provides categories of sub-action for trained behaviors and kinematic measures of individual limb trajectories in an animal model. These behavioral and kinematic measures are difficult but critical to obtain, particularly in the study of pain, OCD, and movement disorders.",

    "abstract": "Previous research suggests that the proximity of individuals in a social network predicts how similarly their brains respond to naturalistic stimuli. However, the relationship between social connectedness and brain connectivity in the absence of external stimuli has not been examined. To investigate whether neural homophily between friends exists at rest we collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 68 school-aged girls, along with social network information from all pupils in their year groups (total 5,066 social dyads). Participants were asked to rate the amount of time they voluntarily spent with each person in their year group, and directed social network matrices and community structure were then determined from these data. No statistically significant relationships between social distance, community homogeneity and similarity of global-level resting-state connectivity were observed. Nor were we able to predict social distance using a machine learning technique (i.e. elastic net regression based on the local-level similarities in resting-state whole-brain connectivity between participants). Although neural homophily between friends exists when viewing naturalistic stimuli, this finding did not extend to functional connectivity at rest in our population. Instead, resting-state connectivity may be less susceptible to the influences of a persons social environment.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide transcriptomic analyses have revealed abundant expressed short open reading frames (ORFs) in bacteria. Whether these short ORFs, or the small proteins they encode, are functional remains an open question. One quarter of mycobacterial mRNAs are leaderless, beginning with a 5-AUG or GUG initiation codon. Leaderless mRNAs often encode unannotated short ORFs as the first gene of a polycistronic transcript. Here we show that polycysteine-encoding leaderless short ORFs function as cysteine-responsive attenuators of operonic gene expression. Detailed mutational analysis shows that one polycysteine short ORF controls expression of the downstream genes. Our data indicate that ribosomes stalled in the polycysteine tract block mRNA structures that otherwise sequester the ribosome-binding site of the 3gene. We assessed endogenous proteomic responses to cysteine limitation in Mycobacterium smegmatis using mass spectrometry. Six cysteine metabolic loci having unannotated polycysteine-encoding leaderless short ORF architectures responded to cysteine limitation, revealing widespread cysteine-responsive attenuation in mycobacteria. Individual leaderless short ORFs confer independent operon-level control, while their shared dependence on cysteine ensures a collective response mediated by ribosome pausing. We propose the term ribulon to classify ribosome-directed regulons. Regulon-level coordination by ribosomes on sensory short ORFs illustrates one utility of the many unannotated short ORFs expressed in bacterial genomes.",

Our method is scalable in parameters and data features, and can rapidly analyze new data after initial training. We demonstrate the power and flexibility of our approach on receptive fields, ion channels, and Hodgkin-Huxley models. We also characterize the space of circuit configurations giving rise to rhythmic activity in the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion, and use these results to derive hypotheses for underlying compensation mechanisms.

    "abstract": "Synaptic diversity is a key feature of neural circuits. The structural and functional diversity of closely spaced inputs converging on the same neuron suggests that cell-surface interactions are essential in organizing input properties. Here, we analyzed the cell-surface protein (CSP) composition of hippocampal mossy fiber (MF) inputs on CA3 pyramidal neurons to identify regulators of MF-CA3 synapse properties. We uncover a rich cell-surface repertoire that includes adhesion proteins, guidance cue receptors, extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, and uncharacterized CSPs. Interactome screening reveals multiple ligand-receptor modules and identifies ECM protein Tenascin-R (TenR) as a ligand of the uncharacterized neuronal receptor IgSF8. Presynaptic Igsf8 deletion impairs MF-CA3 synaptic architecture and robustly decreases the density of bouton filopodia that provide feedforward inhibition of CA3 neurons. Consequently, loss of IgSF8 increases CA3 neuron excitability. Our findings identify IgSF8 as a regulator of CA3 microcircuit development and suggest that combinations of CSP modules define input identity.",

    "abstract": "Human action-stopping is thought to rely on a prefronto-basal ganglia-thalamocortical network, with right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC) posited to play a critical role in the early stage of implementation. Here we sought causal evidence for this idea in experiments involving healthy human participants. We first show that action-stopping is preceded by bursts of electroencephalographic activity in the beta band over prefrontal electrodes, putatively rIFC, and that the timing of these bursts correlates with the latency of stopping at a single-trial level: earlier bursts are associated with faster stopping. From this we reasoned that the integrity of rIFC at the time of beta bursts might be critical to successful stopping. We then used fMRI-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to disrupt rIFC at the approximate time of beta bursting. Stimulation prolonged stopping latencies and, moreover, the prolongation was most pronounced in individuals for whom the pulse appeared closer to the presumed time of beta bursting. These results help validate a model of the neural architecture and temporal dynamics of action-stopping. They also highlight the usefulness of prefrontal beta bursts to index an apparently important sub-process of stopping, the timing of which might help explain within- and between-individual variation in impulse control.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe gut-brain axis and the intestinal microbiota are emerging as key players in health and disease. Shifts in intestinal microbiota composition affect a variety of systems, however, evidence of their direct impact on cognitive functions is still lacking. We tested whether faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) from aged donor mice into young adult recipients affected the hippocampus, an area of the central nervous system (CNS) known to be affected by the ageing process, and related functions.\n\nMethods and FindingsYoung adult mice were transplanted with the microbiota from either aged or age-matched donor mice. Following transplantation, characterization of the microbiotas and metabolomics profiles along with a battery of cognitive and behavioural tests were performed. Label-free quantitative proteomics was employed to monitor protein expression in the hippocampus of the recipients. Gut permeability, levels of circulating cytokines and expression of markers of microglia cells were also assessed. FMT from aged donors led to impaired spatial learning and memory in young adult recipients, whereas anxiety, explorative behaviour and locomotor activity remained unaffected. This was paralleled by altered expression of proteins involved in synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission in the hippocampus. Also, a strong reduction of bacteria associated with short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production (Lachnospiraceae, Faecalibaculum, and Ruminococcaceae) and disorders of the CNS (Prevotellaceae and Ruminococcaceae) was observed. Finally, microglia cells of the hippocampus fimbria, acquired an ageing-like phenotype, while gut permeability and levels of circulating cytokines remained unaffected.\n\nConclusionsThese results demonstrate a direct effect of the age-associated shifts of the microbiota on protein expression and key functions of the central nervous system. Furthermore, these results additionally highlight the paramount importance of the gut-brain axis in ageing and provide a strong rationale to devise therapies aiming to restore a young-like microbiota to improve cognitive functions in the elderly.",

    "abstract": "Loss of functional RAB18 causes the autosomal recessive condition Warburg Micro syndrome. To better understand this disease, we used proximity biotinylation to generate an inventory of potential RAB18 effectors. A restricted set of 28 RAB18-interactions were dependent on the binary RAB3GAP1-RAB3GAP2 RAB18-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) complex. 12 of these 28 interactions are supported by prior reports and we have directly validated novel interactions with SEC22A, TMCO4 and INPP5B. Consistent with a role for RAB18 in regulating membrane contact sites (MCSs), interactors included groups of microtubule/membrane-remodelling proteins, membrane-tethering and docking proteins, and lipid-modifying/transporting proteins. Two of the putative interactors, EBP and OSBPL2/ORP2, have sterol substrates. EBP (emopamil binding protein) is a {Delta}8-{Delta}7 sterol isomerase and OSBPL2/ORP2 is a lipid transport protein. This prompted us to investigate a role for RAB18 in cholesterol biosynthesis. We find that the cholesterol precursor and EBP-product lathosterol accumulates in both RAB18-null HeLa cells and RAB3GAP1-null fibroblasts derived from an affected individual. Further, de novo cholesterol biosynthesis is impaired in cells in which RAB18 is absent or dysregulated. Our data demonstrate that GEF-dependent Rab-interactions are highly amenable to interrogation by proximity biotinylation and may suggest that Micro syndrome is a cholesterol biosynthesis disorder.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) starts decades before clinical symptoms appear. Low glucose utilization in regions of the cerebral cortex marks early AD and is clinically useful. To identify these regions, we conducted a voxel-wise meta-analysis of positron emission tomography studies that compared AD patients with healthy controls. This meta-analysis included 27 studies that assayed glucose utilization in 915 AD patients and 715 healthy controls. The resulting map marks hypometabolism in the posterior cingulate, middle frontal, angular gyrus, middle and inferior temporal regions. Using the Allen Human Brain Atlas, we identified genes with expression patterns associated with this hypometabolism pattern in the cerebral cortex. Of the six brains in the Atlas, one demonstrated a strong spatial association with the hypometabolism pattern. Previous neuropathological assessment of this brain from a 39-year-old male noted a neurofibrillary tangle in the entorhinal cortex. Using the transcriptomic data, we estimate lower proportions of neurons and more microglia in the hypometabolic regions when compared with the other five brains. Within this single brain, signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent cotranslational protein targeting genes, which primarily encode cytosolic ribosome proteins, are highly expressed in the hypometabolic regions. Analyses of human and mouse data show that expression of these genes progressively increases across AD-associated states of microglial activation. In addition, genes involved in cell killing, chronic inflammation, ubiquitination, tRNA aminoacylation, and vacuole sorting are associated with the hypometabolism map. These genes suggest disruption of the protein life cycle and neuroimmune activation. Taken together, our molecular characterization of cortical hypometabolism reveals a molecular link to AD associated hypometabolism that may be relevant to preclinical stages.",

In this study, we performed trypsin shaving and secretome analyses to identify the surface-exposed proteins and secreted/shed proteins of Aspergillus fumigatus conidia, respectively. We investigated the surface proteome under different conditions, including temperature variation and germination. We found that the surface proteome of resting A. fumigatus conidia is not static, but instead unexpectedly dynamic, as evidenced by drastically different surface proteomes under different growth conditions. Knockouts of two abundant A. fumigatus surface proteins, ScwA and CweA, were found to function only in fine-tuning the cell wall stress response, implying that the conidial surface is very robust against perturbations. We then compared the surface proteome of A. fumigatus to other allergy-inducing molds, including Alternaria alternata, Penicillium rubens, and Cladosporium herbarum, and performed comparative proteomics on resting and swollen conidia, as well as secreted proteins from germinating conidia. We detected 125 protein ortholog groups, including 80 with putative catalytic activity, in the extracellular region of all four molds, and 42 nonorthologous proteins produced solely by A. fumigatus. Ultimately, this study highlights the dynamic nature of the A. fumigatus conidial surface and provides targets for future diagnostics and immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Among the first steps in inflammation is the conversion of arachidonic acid (AA) stored in the cell membranes into leukotrienes. This occurs mainly in leukocytes and depends on the interaction of two proteins: 5-lipoxygenase (5LO), stored away from the nuclear membranes until use and 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP), a transmembrane, homotrimeric protein, constitutively present in nuclear membrane. We could earlier visualize the binding of 5LO to nanodiscs in the presence of Ca2+-ions by the use of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on samples negatively stained by sodium phosphotungstate. In the absence of Ca2+-ions 5LO did not bind to the membrane. In the present communication, FLAP reconstituted in the nanodiscs which could be purified if the His-tag was located on the FLAP C-terminus but not the N-terminus. Our aim was to find out if 1) 5LO would bind in a Ca2+-dependent manner also when FLAP is present? 2) Would the substrate (AA) have effects on 5LO binding to FLAP-nanodiscs? TEM was used to assess the complex formation between 5LO and FLAP-nanodiscs along with, sucrose gradient purification, gel-electrophoresis and mass spectroscopy. It was found that presence of AA by itself induces complex formation in the absence of added calcium. This finding corroborates that AA is necessary for the complex formation and that a Ca2+-flush is mainly needed for the recruitment of 5LO to the membrane. Our results also showed that the addition of Ca2+-ions promoted binding of 5LO on the FLAP-nanodiscs as was also the case for nanodiscs without FLAP incorporated. In the absence of added substances no 5LO-FLAP complex was formed. Another finding is that the formation of a 5LO-FLAP complex appears to induce fragmentation of 5LO in vitro.",

Here we quantify their role in the initiation of nucleosome displacement within the kinetic proofreading scenario of chromatin remodeling. The model allows to perform remodeling efficiency comparisons for scenarios involving different types of transcription factors and remodelers as a function of their binding and unbinding rates and concentrations.

    "abstract": "Thermodynamic models of gene regulation can predict transcriptional regulation in bacteria, but in eukaryotes chromatin accessibility and energy expenditure may call for a different framework. Here we systematically tested the predictive power of models of DNA accessibility based on the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model of allostery, which posits that chromatin fluctuates between accessible and inaccessible states. We dissected the regulatory dynamics of hunchback by the activator Bicoid and the pioneer-like transcription factor Zelda in living Drosophila embryos and showed that no thermodynamic or non-equilibrium MWC model can recapitulate hunchback transcription. Therefore, we explored a model where DNA accessibility is not the result of thermal fluctuations but is catalyzed by Bicoid and Zelda, possibly through histone acetylation, and found that this model can predict hunchback dynamics. Thus, our theory-experiment dialogue uncovered potential molecular mechanisms of transcriptional regulatory dynamics, a key step toward reaching a predictive understanding of developmental decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Modular response analysis (MRA) is a widely used modeling technique to uncover coupling strengths in molecular networks under a steady-state condition by means of perturbation experiments. We propose an extension of this methodology to search genomic data for new associations with a network modeled by MRA and to improve the predictive accuracy of MRA models. These extensions are illustrated by exploring the cross talk between estrogen and retinoic acid receptors, two nuclear receptors implicated in several hormone-driven cancers such as breast. We also present a novel, rigorous and elegant mathematical derivation of MRA equations, which is the foundation of this work and of an R package that is freely available at https://github.com/bioinfo-ircm/aiMeRA/. This mathematical analysis should facilitate MRA understanding by newcomers.\n\nAuthor summaryEstrogen and retinoic acid receptors play an important role in several hormone-driven cancers and share co-regulators and co-repressors that modulate their transcription factor activity. The literature shows evidence for crosstalk between these two receptors and suggests that spatial competition on the promoters could be a mechanism. We used MRA to explore the possibility that key co-repressors, i.e., NRIP1 (RIP140) and LCoR could also mediate crosstalk by exploiting new quantitative (qPCR) and RNA sequencing data. The transcription factor role of the receptors and the availability of genome-wide data enabled us to explore extensions of the MRA methodology to explore genome-wide data sets a posteriori, searching for genes associated with a molecular network that was sampled by perturbation experiments. Despite nearly two decades of use, we felt that MRA lacked a systematic mathematical derivation. We present here an elegant and rather simple analysis that should greatly facilitate newcomers understanding of MRA details. Moreover, an easy-to-use R package is released that should make MRA accessible to biology labs without mathematical expertise. Quantitative data are embedded in the R package and RNA sequencing data are available from GEO.",

    "abstract": "Concepts from dynamical systems theory, including multi-stability, oscillations, robustness and stochasticity, are increasingly implicated in the control of gene expression during cell fate decisions, inflammation and stem cell heterogeneity. However, the prevalence of the underlying structures within gene networks which drive these dynamical behaviours, such as direct autoregulation or feedback by microRNAs, is unknown.\n\nWe integrate transcription factor binding site (TFBS) and microRNA target data to generate a gene interaction network across 28 human tissues. This network was interrogated to identify network motifs capable of driving dynamical gene expression, in particular oscillations. Autoregulatory motifs were identified in 56% of transcription factors (TFs) investigated, 89% of which were also found in dual feedback motifs with a microRNA. Both the autoregulatory and dual feedback motifs were enriched in the network. TFs that autoregulate were found to be highly conserved between tissues. Dual feedback motifs with microRNAs were also conserved, but less so. Such dual feedback motifs were conserved between tissues, although TFs regulate different combinations of microRNAs in a tissue-dependent manner.\n\nTFs which autoregulate are prevalent among human TFs and have more interactions with microRNAs than non-autoregulatory genes. The enrichment of such motifs within the human transcriptional network indicates that more genes may have interesting expression dynamics than previously thought. These data provide a resource for the identification of TFs which regulate the dynamical properties of human gene expression. These findings support the development of dynamical conceptual frameworks for the study of fundamental biological processes.",

However, these inhibitors alone do not lead to tumor regression in vivo, indicating the need for combination therapy. Through high throughput combination screening we identify Trametinib and inhibitors of the BCL2 family (Navitoclax and Venetoclax) as a promising combination in neuroblastoma cells with RAS-MAPK mutations. In these lines, inhibiting the RAS-MAPK pathway leads to Bim stabilization and increased sensitivity to compounds inhibiting Bim binding to Bcl2 family members. Combining Trametinib with BCL2 inhibitors causes increased growth inhibition compared to Trametinib only in NRAS mutant SKNAS xenografts, while BCL2 inihibitors alone do not affect growth of these tumors. These results show that MEK inhibitors and specific Bcl2 family member inhibitors are a potent combination for RAS-MAPK mutated neuroblastoma tumors.",

    "abstract": "We present a description of a system that uses a compact binary representation to describe and trace sulci on a reconstructed human cortical surface, based on a set of human-generated targets. The inputs to the system were manually created on a training set of 20 normal subjects (11 females, 9 males) with ages 22 - 40 years. T1 weighted MPRAGE images were collected on a Siemens 3T Trio scanner, with TR/TE = 2530/3.3, matrix = 256x256, FOV = 256mm, slice thickness 1.33mm. The resultant images were reconstructed with Freesurfer, and 10 sulci on each hemisphere were traced by an expert human operator and independently assessed for accuracy. Presented with these input trajectories in its training phase, the system attempted to determine a compact binary feature vector of each sulcus on each subject using as descriptor a binary parametrized function of several surface-geometry variables (such as mean curvature, sulcal depth, edge length, etc.). This function was optimized in a supervised learning fashion using a Dijkstra-based graph theory formulation, in which the binary weights were used to define graph edge costs. In the setup phase, the system was presented with sulcal trajectories already defined on surfaces, and then adjusted its parametrized weights in a binary fashion to minimize differences between the training input path and its Dijkstra-generated output path. Once the setup phase was complete and sulci had been described in a per-sulcus, per-subject manner, we generalized the per-sulcus description across all the subjects to construct a template binary word for each specific sulcus. The performance of the system for each subject and each sulcus, and for each template sulcus group was measured against the original human reference in both a quantitative and qualitative manner. Individual subjects generally showed very good optimization to their manually traced training samples across all sulci, with 91% average overlap within 4mm of the human target. Generalized group results, as expected, showed less overlap with the original human targets, but still performed on average with 80% overlap. Quantitatively, the group results were nonetheless for the most part quite acceptable to an independent human evaluator. The parametrized binary weight description that drives the Dijkstra path optimization is presented as a mechanism to succinctly and compactly describe individual human sulci and groups of sulci.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHuman cochlear hair cells cannot spontaneously regenerate after loss. In contrast, those in fish and amphibians have a remarkable ability to regenerate after damaged. Previous studies focus on signaling mechanisms of hair cell regeneration, such as Wnt and Notch signals but seldom on the fact that the beginning of regeneration is accompanied by a large number of inflammatory responses. The detailed role of this inflammation in hair cell regeneration is still unknown. In addition, there is no appropriate behavioral method to quantitatively evaluate the functional recovery of lateral line hair cells after regeneration.\n\nResultsIn this study, we found that when inflammation was suppressed, the regeneration of lateral line hair cells and the recovery of the rheotaxis of the larvae were significantly delayed. Calcium imaging showed that the function of the neuromasts in the inflammation-inhibited group was weaker than that in the non-inflammation-inhibited group at the Early Stage of regeneration, and returned to normal at the Late Stage. Calcium imaging also revealed the cause of the mismatch between the function and quantity during regeneration.\n\nConclusionsOur results, meanwhile, suggest that suppressing inflammation delays hair cell regeneration and functional recovery when hair cells are damaged. This study may provide a new knowledge for how to promote hair cell regeneration and functional recovery in adult mammals.",

    "abstract": "Plant cells perceive and adapt to an ever-changing environment by modifying their plasma membrane (PM) proteome. Whereas secretion deposits new integral membrane proteins, internalization by endocytosis removes membrane proteins and associated ligands, largely with the aid of adaptor protein complexes and the scaffolding molecule clathrin. Two adaptor protein complexes function in clathrin-mediated endocytosis at the PM in plant cells, the heterotetrameric Adaptor Protein 2 (AP-2) complex and the octameric TPLATE complex (TPC). Whereas single subunit mutants in AP-2 develop into viable plants, genetic mutation of a single TPC subunit causes fully penetrant male sterility and silencing single subunits leads to seedling lethality. To address TPC function in somatic root cells, while minimizing indirect effects on plant growth, we employed nanobody-dependent delocalization of a functional, GFP-tagged TPC subunit, TML, in its respective homozygous genetic mutant background. In order to decrease the amount of functional TPC at the PM, we targeted our nanobody construct to the mitochondria and fused it to TagBFP2 to visualize it independently of its bait. We furthermore limited the effect of our delocalization to those tissues that are easily accessible for live-cell imaging by expressing it from the PIN2 promotor, which is active in root epidermal and cortex cells. With this approach, we successfully delocalized TML from the PM. Moreover, we also show co-recruitment of TML-GFP and AP2A1-TagRFP to the mitochondria, suggesting that our approach delocalized complexes, rather than individual adaptor complex subunits. In line with the specific expression domain, we only observed minor effects on root growth, yet realized a clear reduction of endocytic flux in epidermal root cells. Nanobody-dependent delocalization in plants, here exemplified using a TPC subunit, has the potential to be widely applicable to achieve specific loss-of-function analysis of otherwise lethal mutants.",

One main driver is the investigation of functions and evolutionary lineage of previously identified molluscan GnRH molecules. Emerging evidence suggests not only reproductive, but also diverse biological effects of these molecules and proposes they should most likely be called corazonin (CRZ). Clearly, a more global understanding necessitates further exploration of species-specific functions and structure of invGnRH/CRZ peptides. Towards this goal, we have identified the full-length cDNA of invGnRH/CRZ peptide in an invertebrate model species, the great pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis, termed ly-GnRH/CRZ, and characterized the transcript and peptide distribution in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral organs. Our results are consistent with previous data that molluscan GnRHs are more related to CRZs and serve diverse functions. For this, our findings support the notion that peptides originally termed molluscan GnRH are multifunctional modulators and that nomenclature change should be taken into consideration.",

During the steady state of the contractions, participants either received subthreshold or suprathreshold transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of their motor cortex, while triceps surae muscle responses to stimulation were obtained via electromyography (EMG), and net ankle joint torque was recorded. B-mode ultrasound imaging was used to confirm muscle fascicle stretch during stretch-hold contractions in a subset of participants. Following stretch of the plantar flexors, an average rFE of 7% and 11% was observed for contractions with subthreshold and suprathreshold TMS, respectively. 41-46 ms following subthreshold TMS, triceps surae muscle activity was suppressed by 19-25%, but suppression was not significantly different between stretch-hold and fixed-end contractions. Similarly, the reduction in plantar flexion torque following subthreshold TMS was not significantly different between contraction conditions. Motor evoked potentials, silent periods and superimposed twitches following suprathreshold TMS were also not significantly different between contraction conditions. As TMS of the motor cortex did not result in any differences between stretch-hold and fixed-end contractions, we conclude that rFE is not linked to changes in corticospinal excitability, making rFE a muscle mechanical property rather than a combined neuro-muscular property.",

    "abstract": "A key mechanism in cellular regulation is the ability of the transcriptional machinery to physically access DNA. Pioneer transcription factors interact with DNA to open chromatin, which subsequently enables changes to gene expression during development, disease, or as a response to environmental stimuli. However, the regulation of DNA accessibility via the recruitment of transcription factors is difficult to understand in the context of the native genome because every genomic site is distinct in multiple ways. Here we introduce the Multiplexed Integrated Accessibility Assay (MIAA), a multiplexed parallel reporter assay which measures changes to genome accessibility as a result of the integration of synthetic oligonucleotide phrase libraries into a controlled, natively inaccessible genomic context. We apply MIAA to measure the effects of sequence motifs on cell type-specific DNA accessibility between mouse embryonic stem cells and embryonic stem cell-derived definitive endoderm cells, screening a total of 7,905 distinct phrases. MIAA is able to recapitulate differential accessibility patterns of 100-nt sequences derived from natively differential genomic regions, identifying the presence of E-box motifs common to epithelial-mesenchymal transition driver transcription factors in stem cell-specific accessible regions that become repressed during differentiation to endoderm. We further present causal evidence that a single binding motif for a key regulatory transcription factor is sufficient to open chromatin, and classify sets of stem cell-specific, endoderm-specific, and shared pioneer factor motifs. We also demonstrate that over-expression of two definitive endoderm transcription factors, Brachyury and FoxA2, results in changes to accessibility in phrases containing their respective DNA-binding motifs. Finally, we use MIAA results to explore the order of motif interactions and identify preferential motif ordering arrangements that appear to have an effect on accessibility.",

    "abstract": "Following stroke, the survival of neurons and their ability to re-establish connections is critical to functional recovery. This is strongly influenced by the balance between neuronal excitation and inhibition. In the acute phase of experimental stroke, lethal hyperexcitability can be attenuated by positive allosteric modulation of GABAA receptors (GABAAR). Conversely, in the late phase, negative allosteric modulation of GABAAR can correct the sub-optimal excitability and improves both sensory and motor recovery. Here, we hypothesized that octadecaneuropeptide (ODN), an endogenous allosteric modulator of the GABAAR synthesized by astrocytes, influences the outcome of ischemic brain tissue and subsequent functional recovery. We show that ODN boosts the excitability of cortical neurons, which make it deleterious in the acute phase of stroke. However, if delivered after day 3, ODN is safe and improves motor recovery over the following month in two different paradigms of experimental stroke in mice. Furthermore, we bring evidence that during the sub-acute period after stroke, the repairing cortex can be treated with ODN by means of a single hydrogel deposit into the stroke cavity.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTStroke remains a devastating clinical challenge because there is no efficient therapy to either minimize neuronal death with neuroprotective drugs or to enhance spontaneous recovery with neurorepair drugs. Around the brain damage, the peri-infarct cortex can be viewed as a reservoir of plasticity. However, the potential of wiring new circuits in these areas is restrained by a chronic excess of GABAergic inhibition. Here we show that an astrocyte-derived peptide (ODN), can be used as a delayed treatment, to safely correct cortical excitability and facilitate sensorimotor recovery after stroke.",

    "abstract": "Symbioses of bacteria with fungi have only recently been described and are poorly understood. In the symbiosis of Mycetohabitans (formerly Burkholderia) rhizoxinica with the fungus Rhizopus microsporus, bacterial type III (T3) secretion is known to be essential. Proteins resembling T3-secreted transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors of plant pathogenic bacteria are encoded in the three sequenced Mycetohabitans spp. genomes. TAL effectors nuclear localize in plants, where they bind and activate genes important in disease. The Burkholderia TAL-like (Btl) proteins bind DNA but lack the N- and C-terminal regions in which TAL effectors harbor their T3 and nuclear localization signals, and activation domain. We characterized a Btl protein, Btl19-13, and found that, despite the structural differences, it can be T3-secreted and can nuclear localize. A btl19-13 gene knockout did not prevent the bacterium from infecting the fungus, but the fungus became less tolerant to cell membrane stress. Btl19-13 did not alter transcription in a plant-based reporter assay, but 15 R. microsporus genes were differentially expressed in comparisons both of the fungus infected with the wildtype bacterium vs the mutant and with the mutant vs. a complemented strain. Southern blotting revealed btl genes in 14 diverse Mycetohabitans isolates. However, banding patterns and available sequences suggest variation, and the btl19-13 phenotype could not be rescued by a btl gene from a different strain. Our findings support the conclusion that Btl proteins are effectors that act on host DNA and play important but varied or possibly host-genotype-specific roles in the M. rhizoxinica-R. microsporus symbiosis.",

There is a strong relationship between the chemical nature of the TMD mutations and the potency with which they activate HER2. In silico, we modeled the possible docking conformation of human WNT16B and human ERBB2 TMD homodimer, resulted a mutant complex. The ribbon structure, the C-terminal and N-terminal and GG4-like motif structures are similar in HER2 TMD and HER TMD, we modeled WNTl6Bs possible docking conformation to the HER1 TMD (ErbB), also resulted a mutant complex. If there is a strong relationship between TMD mutations improving the active dimer interface or stabilizing an activated conformation and the potency with which they activate HER2 (and possibly also HER), than the TMD dimerization part seems ideal reagent-target. The agent we tested - the 4-(Furan-2-yl)hepta-1,6-dien-4-ol (AKOS004122375) - has very good connectivity attributes by its several rotatable bonds, and according to the in silico inspection of close residues intermolecular bonds, and the ligand docking, it can straight connect to human ERBB2 TMD (HER2), and to the ErbB TMD (HER1) dimer bilayer motif as well. In silico, we also tested the agent ligands docking into the residues of human WNT16B and human ERBB2 TMD (HER2) mutant complex, and human WNT16B and human ErbB TMD (HER1) mutant complex. We tested the agent ligand in vitro and in vivo in several tumor models, highlighting that targeting the EGFRs TMD with an agent not only reduces treatment-induced metastasis, but radically decreases the tumor growth as well. Because of the analogous structure of HER2 TMD and HER TMD, this dimerization motif-targeting can also be successful in HER and HER2 EGFR signaling. In vitro, we reached 80-94% proliferation percentage in different tumor models, in vivo we reached 35-61% tumor suppression in different tumor models, the metastasis inhibition effect of the compound was 82-87% in different tumor models.",

Depleting the m6A MTC leads to a decrease in RNAP II pause release and in Ser2P occupancy on the gene body, and affects nascent RNA transcription. Tethering Mettl3 to a heterologous gene promoter is sufficient to increase RNAP II pause release, an effect that relies on its m6A catalytic domain. Collectively, our data reveal an important link between RNAP II pausing and the m6A RNA modification, thus adding another layer to m6A-mediated gene regulation.",

Here, we present the first database of terrestrial vertebrate species introductions spanning the entire anthropogenic history of a system: the Caribbean. We employ this ~7,000 year dataset to assess the roles of historical contingency and priority effects in shaping present-day community structure and conservation outcomes, finding that serial human colonization events contributed to habitat modifications and species extinctions that shaped the trajectories of subsequent species introductions by other human groups. We contextualized spatial and temporal patterns of species introductions within cultural practices and population histories of Indigenous, colonial, and modern human societies, and show that the taxonomic and biogeographic diversity of introduced species reflects diversifying reasons for species introductions through time. Recognition of the complex social and economic structures across the 7,000-year human history of the Caribbean provides the necessary context for interpreting the formation of an Anthropocene biota.",

    "abstract": "Introductory paragraphThe evolution and diversification of Archaea is central to the history of life on Earth. Cultivation-independent approaches have revealed the existence of at least ten archaeal lineages whose members have small cell and genome sizes and limited metabolic capabilities and together comprise the tentative DPANN archaea. However, the phylogenetic diversity of DPANN and the placement of the various lineages of this group in the archaeal tree remain debated. Here, we reconstructed additional metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) of a thus far uncharacterized archaeal phylum-level lineage UAP2 (Candidatus Undinarchaeota) affiliating with DPANN archaea. Comparative genome analyses revealed that members of the Undinarchaeota have small estimated genome sizes and, while potentially being able to conserve energy through fermentation, likely depend on partner organisms for the acquisition of vitamins, amino acids and other metabolites. Phylogenomic analyses robustly recovered Undinarchaeota as a major independent lineage between two highly supported clans of DPANN: one clan comprising Micrarchaeota, Altiarchaeota and Diapherotrites, and another encompassing all other DPANN. Our analyses also suggest that DPANN archaea may have exchanged core genes with their hosts by horizontal gene transfer (HGT), adding to the difficulty of placing DPANN in the archaeal tree. Together, our findings provide crucial insights into the origins and evolution of DPANN archaea and their hosts.",

We inferred interactions from sequence-based counts of bacteria in a series of Arabidopsis thaliana tissue samples spanning major developmental transitions in the plant life cycle (2). Bacterial interactions were transient, even among variants found together at consecutive developmental stages. The overwhelming majority of these interactions were positive, indicating that competition for the plant niche might be a less important driver of bacterial abundances than cooperation or common responses to host and environmental factors. Over time, interaction networks diverged from an initial scale-free structure and became increasingly modular. In all networks, we found evidence of a hierarchical structure in which hub bacteria bridged network modules. However, the identities of bacteria in these influential roles also varied during plant growth.",

However, by exposing hypocotyls to external mechanical cues mimicking the natural soil environment, we reveal that auxin response factors ARF7/ARF19, auxin influx carriers, and katanin are dispensable for apical hook formation, indicating that these factors primarily play the role of catalyzers of tissue bending in the absence of external mechanical cues. Instead, our results reveal the key roles of the non-canonical TMK-mediated auxin pathway, PIN efflux carriers and cellulose microfibrils as components of the core pathway behind hook formation in presence or absence of external mechanical cues.",

We now disclose crystal structures of M. tuberculosis FasR in complex with acyl effector ligands and with DNA, uncovering its sensory and switching mechanisms. A long tunnel traverses the entire effector-binding domain, enabling long fatty acyl effectors to bind. Only when the tunnel is entirely occupied, the protein dimer adopts a rigid configuration, with its DNA-binding domains in an open state that leads to DNA dissociation. Structure-guided point-mutations further support this effector-dependent mechanism. The protein-folding hydrophobic core, connecting the two domains, is completed by the effector ligand into a continuous spine, explaining the allosteric flexible-to-ordered transition. The transmission spine is conserved in all TetR-like transcription factors, offering new opportunities for anti-tuberculosis drug discovery.",

Although a role of TRPA1 in mammalian mechanosensory transduction in vivo seems likely, it remains to be shown that TRPA1 has the inherent capability to respond to mechanical stimuli. Here we have used the patch-clamp technique to study the response of human purified TRPA1 (hTRPA1), reconstituted into artificial lipid bilayers, to changes in bilayer pressure. We report that hTRPA1 responded with increased single-channel open probability (Po) within the applied pressure interval of 7.5 to 60 mmHg with a half maximum Po (P50) value of 38.0 {+/-} 2.3 mmHg. The Po value reached a maximum close to 1 (0.87 {+/-} 0.02) at 60 mmHg. Within the same pressure interval, hTRPA1 without its N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain ({Delta}1-688 hTRPA1) responded fully opened (0.99 {+/-} 0.01) at 60 mmHg and with a P50 value of 39.0 {+/-} 1.1 mmHg. The pressure-evoked responses of hTRPA1 and {Delta}1-688 hTRPA1 at 45 mmHg were inhibited by the TRPA1 antagonist HC030031, and the activity of purified hTRPA1 at 45 mmHg was abolished by the thiol reducing agent tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP). In conclusion, hTRPA1 is an inherent mechanosensitive ion channel gated by force-from-lipids. The hTRPA1 mechanosensitivity is dependent on the redox environment, and it is suggested that oxidative stress shifts hTRPA1 into a protein conformation sensitive to mechanical stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Metagenomics facilitates the study of the genetic information from uncultured microbes and complex microbial communities. Assembling complete microbial genomes (i.e., circular with no misassemblies) from metagenomics data is difficult because most samples have high organismal complexity and strain diversity. Less than 100 circularized bacterial and archaeal genomes have been assembled from metagenomics data despite the thousands of datasets that are available. Circularized genomes are important for (1) building a reference collection as scaffolds for future assemblies, (2) providing complete gene content of a genome, (3) confirming little or no contamination of a genome, (4) studying the genomic context and synteny of genes, and (5) linking protein coding genes to ribosomal RNA genes to aid metabolic inference in 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies. We developed a method to achieve circularized genomes using iterative assembly, binning, and read mapping. In addition, this method exposes potential misassemblies from k-mer based assemblies. We chose species of the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) to focus our initial efforts because they have small genomes and are only known to have one ribosomal RNA operon. We present 34 circular CPR genomes, one circular Margulisbacteria genome, and two circular megaphage genomes from 19 public and published datasets. We demonstrate findings that would likely be difficult without circularizing genomes, including that ribosomal genes are likely not operonic in the majority of CPR, and that some CPR harbor diverged forms of RNase P RNA.

    "abstract": "Massive parallel sequencing is revolutionizing the field of molecular ecology by allowing to understand better the evolutionary history of populations and species, and to detect genomic regions that could be under selection. However, the needed economic and computational resources generate a tradeoff between the amount of loci that can be obtained and the number of populations or individuals that can be sequenced. In this work, we analyzed and compared two extensive genomic and one large microsatellite datasets consisting of empirical data. We generated different subsampling designs by changing the number of loci, individuals, populations and individuals per population to test for deviations in classic population genetics parameters (HS, FIS, FST) and landscape genetic tests (isolation by distance and environment, central abundance hypothesis). We also tested the effect of sampling different number of populations in the detection of outlier SNPs. We found that the microsatellite dataset is very sensitive to the number of individuals sampled when obtaining summary statistics. FIS was particularly sensitive to a low sampling of individuals in the genomic and microsatellite datasets. For the genomic datasets, we found that as long as many populations are sampled, few individuals and loci are needed. For all datasets we found that increasing the number of population sampled is important to obtain precise landscape genetic estimates. Finally, we corroborated that outlier tests are sensitive to the number of populations sampled. We conclude by proposing different sampling designs depending on the objectives.",

    "abstract": "RATIONALESingle cell RNA-sequencing (scRNASeq) has led to multiple recent advances in our understanding of lung biology and pathophysiology, but utility is limited by the need for fresh samples, loss of cell types due to death or inadequate dissociation, and the induction of transcriptional stress responses during tissue digestion. Single nucleus RNASeq (snRNASeq) has addressed these deficiencies in some other tissues, but no protocol exists for lung. We sought to develop such a protocol and compare its results with scRNA-seq.\n\nMETHODSSingle nucleus suspensions were prepared rapidly (45 min) from two mouse lungs in lysis buffer on ice while a single cell suspension from an additional mouse lung was generated using a combination of enzymatic and mechanical dissociation (1.5 h). Cells and nuclei were processed using the 10x Genomics platform, and following sequencing of cDNA libraries single cell data was analyzed by Seurat.\n\nRESULTS16,656 single nucleus and 11,934 single cell transcriptomes were generated. Despite reduced mRNA levels in nuclei vs. cells, gene detection rates were equivalent in snRNASeq and scRNASeq ([~]1,750 genes and 3,000 UMI per cell) when mapping intronic and exonic reads. snRNASeq identified a much greater proportion of epithelial cells than scRNASeq (46% vs 2% of total), including basal and neuroendocrine cells, while reducing immune cells from 54% to 15%. snRNASeq transcripts are enriched for transcription factors and signaling proteins, with reduced detection of housekeeping genes, mitochondrial genes, and artifactual stress response genes. Both techniques improved mesenchymal cell detection over previous studies, and analysis of fibroblast diversity showed two transcriptionally distinct populations of Col13a1+ cells, termed Bmper+ and Brinp1+ fibroblasts. To define homeostatic signaling relationships among cell types, receptor-ligand mapping of was performed for alveolar compartment cells using snRNASeq data, revealing complex interplay among epithelial, mesenchymal, and capillary endothelial cells.\n\nCONCLUSIONSingle nucleus RNASeq can be readily applied to snap frozen, archival murine lung samples, improves dissociation bias, eliminates artifactual gene expression and provides similar gene detection compared to scRNASeq.",

Here, we utilise these improvements to demonstrate that near-complete flagellar capture is realisable on the scale of hundreds of cells, and, further, that meaningful statistical comparisons of flagellar waveforms may be readily performed with widely-available tools. Representing the advent of high-fidelity computer-assisted beat-pattern analysis (CABA), we show how such a statistical approach can distinguish between samples using complex flagellar beating patterns rather than crude summary statistics. Dimensionality-reduction techniques applied to entire samples also reveal qualitatively-distinct components of the beat, and a novel data-driven methodology for the generation of representative synthetic waveform data is proposed.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMatched-set data arise frequently in microbiome studies. For example, we may collect pre- and post-treatment samples from a set of individuals, or use important confounding variables to match data from case participants to one or more control participants. Thus, there is a need for statistical methods for data comprised of matched sets, to test hypotheses against traits of interest (e.g., clinical outcomes or environmental factors) at the community level and/or the OTU (operational taxonomic unit) level. Optimally, these methods should accommodate complex data such as those with unequal sample sizes cross sets, confounders varying within sets, as well as continuous traits of interest.\n\nMethodsPERMANOVA is a commonly used distance-based method for testing hypotheses at the community level. We have also developed the linear decomposition model (LDM) that unifies the community-level and OTU-level tests into one framework. Here we present a strategy that can be used with both PERMANOVA and the LDM for analyzing matched-set data. We propose to include an indicator variable for each set as covariates, so as to constrain comparisons between samples within a set, and also permute traits within each set, which can account for exchangeable sample correlations. The flexible nature of PERMANOVA and the LDM allows discrete or continuous traits or interactions to be tested, within-set confounders to be adjusted, and unbalanced data to be fully exploited.\n\nResultsOur simulations indicate that our proposed strategy outperformed alternative strategies in a wide range of scenarios. Using simulation, we also explored optimal designs for matched-set studies. The flexibility of PERMANOVA and the LDM for a variety of matched-set microbiome data is illustrated by the analysis of data from two real studies.\n\nConclusionsIncluding set indicator variables and permuting within sets when analyzing matched-set data with PERMANOVA or the LDM is a strategy that performs well and is capable of handling the complex data structures that frequently occur in microbiome studies.",

For this purpose, we develop a Bivariate Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (BZINB) model that has a simple latent variable framework and parameters with intuitive interpretations. Using this model, we examine two biomedical data examples where the counts are zero-inflated--single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data and dental caries count indices. In scRNA-seq data example, a correlation between a pair of genes is estimated after adjusting for the effects of dropout events represented by excess zeros. In the dental caries data, we analyze how the treatment with Xylitol mints affects the marginal mean and other patterns of response manifested in the two dental caries traits.

    "abstract": "Faba bean (Vicia faba L.) is an important protein-rich fodder crop widely cultivated in temperate areas. However, antinutritional compounds such as condensed tannins, limit the use of this protein source in monogastric feed formulations. Previous studies demonstrated that two recessive and complementary genes, zt1 and zt2, control the absence of tannin and the white flower colour in faba bean. An ortholog of the Medicago WD40 transcription factor, (TTG1) was reported to encode the zt1 phenotypes but the responsible gene for zt2 is still unknown. A candidate gene approach combined with linkage mapping, comparative genomics and gene expression has been used in this study to fine map the zt2 genomic region and to identify the regulatory gene controlling both traits. Seventy-two genes, including 23 regulatory genes (MYB and bHLH) predicted to be associated with anthocyanin expression together with WRKY proteins were screened and genotyped in three mapping populations. The linkage groups constructed identified the regulatory gene, TRANSPARENT TESTA8 (TT8), encoding a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor (bHLH), as the best candidate for zt2. This finding was supported by qPCR analyses and further validated in different genetic backgrounds. Accordingly, VfTT8 was down-regulated in white flowered types, in contrast to the levels of expression in wild genotypes. Our results provide new insights on the regulatory mechanisms for tannin biosynthesis in faba bean and will favour the development of an ultimate zt2 diagnostic marker for the fast generation of new value-added cultivars free of tannins and improved nutritional value.",

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) involve in many biological processes such development, infection, and virus-host interaction. However, there is no systematic identification and characterization of lncRNAs in Cx. quinquefasciatus. Here, we report the first ever lncRNA identification in Cx. quinquefasciatus. By using 31 public RNA-seq datasets, a total of 4,763 novel lncRNA transcripts were identified, of which 3,591, 569, and 603 were intergenic, intronic, and antisense respectively. Examination of genomic features revealed that Cx. quinquefasciatus shared similar characteristics with other species such as short in length, low GC content, low sequence conservation, and low coding potential. Furthermore, compared to protein-coding genes, Cx. quinquefasciatus lncRNAs had lower expression values, and tended to be expressed in temporally-specific fashion. In addition, weighted correlation network and functional annotation analyses showed that lncRNAs may have roles in blood meal acquisition of adult female Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes. This study presents the first systematic identification and analysis of Cx. quinquefasciatus lncRNAs and their association with blood feeding. Results generated from this study will facilitate future investigation on the function of Cx. quinquefasciatus lncRNAs.",

In this study, we identified an interacting partner of OsIRO2, Oryza sativa FER-LIKE FE DEFICIENCY-INDUCED TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR (OsFIT), which encodes a bHLH transcription factor. The OsIRO2 protein is localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, but OsFIT facilitates the accumulation of OsIRO2 in the nucleus. Loss-of-function mutations to OsFIT result in decreased Fe accumulation, severe Fe-deficiency symptoms, and disrupted expression of Fe-uptake genes. In contrast, OsFIT overexpression promotes Fe accumulation and the expression of Fe-uptake genes. Genetic analyses indicated that OsFIT and OsIRO2 function in the same genetic node. Further analysis suggested that OsFIT and OsIRO2 form a functional transcription activation complex to initiate the expression of Fe-uptake genes. Our findings provide a mechanism understanding of how rice maintains Fe homeostasis.\n\nOne-sentence summaryOsFIT interacts with and facilitates the accumulation of OsIRO2 in the nucleus where the OsFIT-OsIRO2 transcription complex initiates the transcription of Fe deficiency responsive genes.",

While L. marina exhibits massive gene contractions in NHRs, chemoreceptors, xenobiotics detoxification and core histones, which could explain the more defined marine environment. Our experiments showed that dozens of H4 genes in Caenorhabditis elegans might contribute to its adaptation to the complex terrestrial environments, while two H4 genes in L. marina are involved in salinity stress adaptation. Additionally, ninety-two conserved genes appear to be positively selected in L. marina, which may underpin its osmotic, neuronal and epigenetic changes in the sea. With short generation time, highly inbred lines, and genomic resources, our report brings L. marina a promising marine animal model, and a unique satellite marine model to the well-known biomedical model nematode C. elegans.

    "abstract": "The bacterial pathogen Mycobacterium (M.) tuberculosis is the leading cause of death by an infectious disease among humans. Here, we describe a previously uncharacterized M. tuberculosis protein, Rv0991c, as a molecular chaperone that is activated by oxidation. Rv0991c has homologues in most bacterial lineages and appears to function analogously to the well-characterized Escherichia coli redox-regulated chaperone Hsp33, despite a dissimilar protein sequence. Rv0991c is transcriptionally co-regulated with hsp60 and hsp70 chaperone genes in M. tuberculosis, suggesting that Rv0991c functions with these chaperones in maintaining protein quality control. Supporting this hypothesis, we found that, like oxidized Hsp33, oxidized Rv0991c prevents the aggregation of a model unfolded protein in vitro, and promotes its refolding by the M. tuberculosis Hsp70 chaperone system. Furthermore, Rv0991c interacts with DnaK and associates with many other M. tuberculosis proteins. Importantly, we found Rv0991c is required for the full virulence of M. tuberculosis in mice. We therefore propose that Rv0991c, which we named \"Ruc\" (redox-regulated protein with unstructured C-terminus), represents a founding member of a new chaperone family that protects M. tuberculosis and other species from proteotoxicity during oxidative stress.\n\nIMPORTANCEM. tuberculosis infections are responsible for more than one million human deaths per year. Developing effective strategies to combat this disease requires a greater understanding of M. tuberculosis biology. As in all cells, protein quality control is essential for the viability of M. tuberculosis, which likely faces proteome stress within a host. Here, we identify an M. tuberculosis protein, Ruc, that gains chaperone activity upon oxidation. Ruc represents a previously unrecognized family of redox-regulated chaperones found throughout the bacterial super-kingdom. In addition to elucidating the activity of this chaperone, we found that Ruc was required for full M. tuberculosis virulence in mice. This work contributes to a growing appreciation that oxidative stress may provide a particular strain on protein stability in cells, and may likewise play a role in M. tuberculosis pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Genetically encodable fluorescent proteins have revolutionized biological imaging in vivo and in vitro. Since there are no other natural fluorescent tags with comparable features, the impact of fluorescent proteins for biological research cannot be overemphasized. Despite their importance, their photophysical properties, i.e., brightness, count-rate and photostability, are relatively poor compared to synthetic organic fluorophores or quantum dots. Intramolecular photostabilizers were recently rediscovered as an effective approach to improve photophysical properties. The approach uses direct conjugation of photostablizing compounds such as triplet-state quenchers or redox-active substances to an organic fluorophore, thereby creating high local concentrations of photostabilizer. Here, we introduce an experimental strategy to screen for the effects of covalently-linked photostabilizers on fluorescent proteins. We recombinantly produced a double cysteine mutant (A206C/L221C) of -GFP for attachment of photostabilizer-maleimides on the {beta}-barrel in close proximity to the chromophore. Whereas labelling with photostabilizers such as Trolox, Nitrophenyl, and Cyclooctatetraene, which are often used for organic fluorophores, had no effect on -GFP-photostability, a substantial increase of photostability was found upon conjugation of -GFP to an azobenzene derivative. Although the mechanism of the photostabilizing effects remains to be elucidated, we speculate that the higher triplet-energy of azobenzene might be crucial for triplet-quenching of fluorophores in the near-UV and blue spectral range. Our study paves the way towards the development and design of a second generation of fluorescent proteins with photostabilizers placed directly in the protein barrel by methods such as unnatural amino acid incorporation.",

    "abstract": "The actin cytoskeleton assembles into diverse load-bearing networks including stress fibers, muscle sarcomeres, and the cytokinetic ring to both generate and sense mechanical forces. The LIM (Lin11, Isl-1 & Mec-3) domain family is functionally diverse, but most members can associate with the actin cytoskeleton with apparent force-sensitivity. Zyxin rapidly localizes via its LIM domains to failing stress fibers in cells, known as strain sites, to initiate stress fiber repair and maintain mechanical homeostasis. The mechanism by which these LIM domains associate with stress fiber strain sites is not known. Additionally, it is unknown how widespread strain sensing is within the LIM protein family. We observe that many, but not all, LIM domains from functionally diverse proteins localize to spontaneous or induced stress fiber strain sites in mammalian cells. Additionally, the LIM domain region from the fission yeast protein paxillin like 1 (Pxl1) also localizes to stress fiber strain sites in mammalian cells, suggesting that the strain sensing mechanism is ancient and highly conserved. Sequence analysis and mutagenesis of the LIM domain region of zyxin indicate a requirement of tandem LIM domains, which contribute additively, for sensing stress fiber strain sites. In vitro, purified LIM domains from mammalian zyxin and fission yeast Pxl1 bind to mechanically stressed F-actin networks but do not associate with relaxed actin filaments. We propose that tandem LIM domains recognize an F-actin conformation that is rare in the relaxed state but is enriched in the presence of mechanical stress.",

    "abstract": "Six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate (STEAP1) is an integral membrane protein that is highly upregulated on the cell surface of several human cancers, making it a promising therapeutic target. It shares sequence homology with three enzymes (STEAP2-4) that catalyze the NADPH-dependent reduction of iron(III). However, STEAP1 lacks an intracellular NADPH-binding domain and does not exhibit cellular ferric-reductase activity. Thus, both the molecular function of STEAP1 and its role in cancer progression remain elusive. Here, we present a ~3.0 [A] cryo-electron microscopy structure of trimeric human STEAP1 bound to three Fab-fragments of the clinically employed antibody mAb120.545. STEAP1 adopts a reductase-like conformation and interacts with the Fabs through its extracellular helices. Enzymatic assays in human cells reveal that STEAP1 promotes iron(III) reduction when fused to the intracellular NADPH-binding domain of its family member STEAP4, implicating STEAP1 as a functional ferric reductase in STEAP hetero-trimers. Our work provides a foundation for deciphering the molecular mechanisms of STEAP1 and will be instrumental in the design of new therapeutic strategies to target STEAP1 in cancer.",

To characterize the earliest stages of human brain development, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing across regions of the developing human brain, including the telencephalon, diencephalon, midbrain, hindbrain, and cerebellum. We identify nine progenitor populations physically proximal to the telencephalon, suggesting more heterogeneity than previously described, including a highly prevalent mesenchymal-like population that disappears once neurogenesis begins. Comparison of human and mouse progenitor populations at corresponding stages identifies two progenitor clusters that are enriched in the early stages of human cortical development. We also find that organoid systems display low fidelity to neuroepithelial and early radial glia cell types, but improve as neurogenesis progresses. Overall, we provide a comprehensive molecular and spatial atlas of early stages of human brain and cortical development.",

    "abstract": "Cellular identity in complex multicellular organisms is strictly maintained over the course of life. This control is achieved in part by the organ structure itself, such that neighboring cells influence each others identity. However, large-scale investigation of the cellular interactome has been technically challenging. Here, we develop CIM-seq, an unsupervised and high-throughput method to analyze direct physical cell-cell interactions between every cell type in a given tissue. CIM-seq is based on RNA sequencing of incompletely dissociated cells, followed by computational deconvolution of these into their constituent cell types using machine learning. We use CIM-seq to define the cell interaction landscape of the mouse small intestinal and colonic epithelium, uncovering both known and novel interactions. Specifically, we find that the general architecture of the stem cell niche is radically different between the two tissues. In small intestine, the stem-Paneth cell interaction forms an exceptionally strong and exclusive niche, in which Paneth cells provide Wnt ligands1. In colonic epithelium, no similar compartment exists to support stem cells, and Wnt signaling is provided by a mesenchymal cell layer2,3. However, colonic stem cells are supported by an adjacent, previously unrecognized goblet cell subtype expressing the wound-healing marker Plet1, which is also highly upregulated during regeneration of colon epithelium. These results identify novel cellular interactions specific for the colonic stem cell niche and suggest an additional level of structural control in the colon. CIM-seq is broadly applicable to studies that aim to simultaneously investigate the constituent cell types and the global interaction profile in a specific tissue.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical signals transmitted through the cytoplasmic actin cytoskeleton must be relayed to the nucleus to control gene expression. LIM domains are protein-protein interaction modules found in cytoskeletal proteins and transcriptional regulators; however, it is unclear if there is a direct link between these two functions. Here we identify three LIM protein families (zyxin, paxillin, and FHL) whose members preferentially localize to the actin cytoskeleton in mechanically-stimulated cells through their tandem LIM domains. A minimal actin-myosin reconstitution system reveals that representatives of all three families directly bind F-actin only in the presence of mechanical force. Point mutations at a site conserved in each LIM domain of these proteins selectively disrupt tensed F-actin binding in vitro and cytoskeletal localization in cells, demonstrating a common, avidity-based mechanism. Finally, we find that binding to tensed F-actin in the cytoplasm excludes the cancer-associated transcriptional co-activator FHL2 from the nucleus in stiff microenvironments. This establishes direct force-activated F-actin binding by FHL2 as a mechanosensing mechanism. Our studies suggest that force-dependent sequestration of LIM proteins on the actin cytoskeleton could be a general mechanism for controlling nuclear localization to effect mechanical signaling.",

    "abstract": "Myoblast fusion is required for myotube formation during myogenesis, and defects in myoblast differentiation and fusion have been implicated in a number of diseases, including human rhabdomyosarcoma. While the transcriptional regulation of the myogenic program has been studied extensively, the mechanisms controlling myoblast fusion remain largely unknown. This study identified and characterized the dynamics of a distinct class of blebs, termed bubbling blebs, which are smaller than those that participate in migration. The formation of these bubbling blebs occurred during differentiation and decreased alongside a decline in phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) at the plasma membrane before myoblast fusion. In a human rhabdomyosarcoma-derived (RD) cell line that exhibits strong blebbing dynamics and myoblast fusion defects, PIP3 was constitutively abundant on the membrane during myogenesis. Targeting phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) to the plasma membrane reduced PIP3 levels, inhibited bubbling blebs, and rescued myoblast fusion defects in RD cells. These findings highlight the differential distribution and crucial role of PIP3 during myoblast fusion and reveal a novel mechanism underlying myogenesis defects in human rhabdomyosarcoma.\n\nSummary StatementThis study reveals a novel mechanism underlying myogenesis defects in human rhabdomyosarcoma cells involving PIP3, whose depletion with PTEN rescues myoblast fusion defects.",

Inhibition of protein aggregation by photo-excited dyes is emerging as novel strategy for the treatment of certain diseases. Toluidine Blue is a basic phenothiazine dye having potency of photo-excitation by irradiation with red light at 630{+/-}20 nm. In present work, we studied the effect of Toluidine Blue and photo-excited TB on aggregation of repeat Tau in-vitro using Thioflavin S fluorescence assay, SDS-PAGE and electron microscopy. Results show that TB efficiently inhabited the formation of higher order aggregates. Moreover, the photo-excited TB led to disaggregation of the mature repeat Tau fibrils. Further, studies on the effect of Toluidine blue on cell viability and cytoskeleton network of Neuro2acells show that TB was not toxic to neuronal cells at lower concentrations but at high concentrations (> 5 M) both TB and photo-excited TB induced significant toxicity. Immunofluorescence studies on the cytoskeleton of Neuro2a cells show that Toluidine Blue and photo-excited Toluidine Blue treatment at non-toxic concentration of 0.5 M stimulated formation of actin rich lamellipodia and filopodia structures. Tubulin networks were also differentially modulated after the treatment of Toluidine Blue and photo-excited Toluidine Blue. End Binding protein 1 (EB1) levels were observed to increase after Toluidine Blue and photo-excited Toluidine Blue treatment indicating the accelerated microtubule polymerization.

While FOXL2 is known of regulating sex differentiation and reproductive function, the impact of elevated FOXL2 expression on uterine physiology remains unknown. To answer this question, we generated mice with over expression of FOXL2 (FOXL2OE) in the female reproductive tract by crossing Foxl2LsL/+ with the Pgrcre model. FOXL2OE uterus showed severe morphological abnormality including abnormal epithelial stratification, blunted adenogenesis, increased endometrial fibrosis and disrupted myometrial morphology. In contrast, increasing FOXL2 levels specifically in uterine epithelium by crossing the Foxl2LsL/+ with the Ltficre mice resulted in the eFOXL2OE mice with uterine epithelial stratification but without defects in endometrial fibrosis and adenogenesis, demonstrating a role of the endometrial stroma in the uterine abnormalities of the FOXL2OE mice. Transcriptomic analysis of 12 weeks old Pgrcre and FOXL2OE uterus at diestrus stage showed a positive correlation of FOXL2OE uterine transcriptome with human endometrium of endometriosis patients. Furthermore, we found FOXL2OE mice were sterile. The infertility was caused in part by a disruption of the hypophyseal ovarian axis resulting in an anovulatory phenotype. The FOXL2OE mice failed to show decidual responses during artificial decidualization in ovariectomized mice which demonstrates the uterine contribution to the infertility phenotype. These data supported that aberrantly increased FOXL2 expressions in the female reproductive tract can disrupt ovarian and uterine functions, particularly, may be involved in the progressions of endometriosis.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria control eukaryotic cell fate by producing the energy needed to support life and the signals required to execute programmed cell death. The biochemical milieu is known to affect mitochondrial function and contribute to the dysfunctional mitochondrial phenotypes implicated in cancer and the morbidities of ageing. However, the physical characteristics of the extracellular matrix are also altered in cancer and in aging tissues. We demonstrate that cells sense the physical properties of the extracellular matrix and activate a mitochondrial stress response that adaptively tunes mitochondrial function via SLC9A1-dependent ion exchange and HSF1-dependent transcription. Overall, our data indicate that adhesion-mediated mechanosignaling may play an unappreciated role in the altered mitochondrial functions observed in aging and cancer.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=154 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/979583v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (41K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ecdaceorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1112c32org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6c99a1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1da1e5f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Synaptic membrane-remodeling events such as endocytosis require force-generating actin assembly. The endocytic machinery that regulates these actin and membrane dynamics localizes at high concentrations to large areas of the presynaptic membrane, but actin assembly and productive endocytosis are far more restricted in space and time. Here we describe a mechanism whereby autoinhibition clamps the presynaptic endocytic machinery to limit actin assembly to discrete functional events. We found that collective interactions between the Drosophila endocytic proteins Nwk/FCHSD2, Dap160/Intersectin, and WASp relieve Nwk autoinhibition and promote robust membrane-coupled actin assembly in vitro. Using automated particle tracking to quantify synaptic actin dynamics in vivo, we discovered that Nwk-Dap160 interactions constrain spurious assembly of WASp-dependent actin structures. These interactions also promote synaptic endocytosis, suggesting that autoinhibition both clamps and primes the synaptic endocytic machinery, thereby constraining actin assembly to drive productive membrane remodeling in response to physiological cues.",

    "abstract": "The spread of COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has been growing since its first identification in December 2019. The publishing of the first SARS-CoV-2 genome made a valuable source of data to study the details about its phylogeny, evolution, and interaction with the host. Protein-protein binding assays have confirmed that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is more likely to be the cell receptor through which the virus invades the host cell. In the present work, we provide an insight into the interaction of the viral spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) from different coronavirus isolates with host ACE2 protein. By calculating the binding energy score between RBD and ACE2, we highlighted the putative jump in the affinity from a progenitor form of SARS-CoV-2 to the current virus responsible for COVID-19 outbreak. Our result was consistent with previously reported phylogenetic analysis and corroborates the opinion that the interface segment of the spike protein RBD might be acquired by SARS-CoV-2 via a complex evolutionary process rather than a progressive accumulation of mutations. We also highlighted the relevance of Q493 and P499 amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 RBD for binding to human ACE2 and maintaining the stability of the interface. Moreover, we show from the structural analysis that it is unlikely for the interface residues to be the result of genetic engineering. Finally, we studied the impact of eight different variants located at the interaction surface of ACE2, on the complex formation with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We found that none of them is likely to disrupt the interaction with the viral RBD of SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "The current outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by a novel betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has aroused great public health concern. Coronavirus has a history of causing epidemics in human and animals. In 2017 an outbreak in piglets by a novel coronavirus was emerged designated as swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) which is originated from the same genus of horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus) as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) having a broad species tropism. In addition to human cells, it can also infect cell lines from diverse species. Coronavirus host range is determined by its spike glycoprotein (S). Given the importance of S protein in viral entry to cells and host immune responses, here we report the cryo-EM structure of the SADS-CoV S in the prefusion conformation at a resolution of 3.55 [A]. Our study reveals that SADS-CoV S structure takes an intra-subunit quaternary packing mode where the NTD and CTD from the same subunit pack together by facing each other. The comparison of NTD and CTD with that of the other four genera suggests the evolutionary process of the SADS-CoV S. Moreover, SADS-CoV S has several characteristic structural features, such as more compact architecture of S trimer, and masking of epitopes by glycan shielding, which may facilitate viral immune evasion. These data provide new insights into the evolutionary relationships of SADS-CoV S and would extend our understanding of structural and functional diversity, which will facilitate to vaccine development.",

    "abstract": "A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of an emergent severe respiratory disease (COVID-19) in humans that is threatening to result in a global health crisis. By using genomic, sequence, structural and evolutionary analysis, we show that Alpha- and Beta-CoVs possess several novel families of immunoglobulin (Ig) domain proteins, including ORF8 and ORF7a from SARS-related coronaviruses and two protein groups from certain Alpha-CoVs. Among them, ORF8 is distinguished in being rapidly evolving, possessing a unique insert and a hypervariable position among SARS-CoV-2 genomes in its predicted ligand-binding groove. We also uncover many Ig proteins from several metazoan viruses which are distinct in sequence and structure but share an architecture comparable to that of CoV Ig domain proteins. Hence, we propose that deployment of Ig domain proteins is a widely-used strategy by viruses, and SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 is a potential pathogenicity factor which evolves rapidly to counter the immune response and facilitate the transmission between hosts.",

    "abstract": "Zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs) are significant threats to global health, as exemplified by the recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1. Host immune responses to CoV are complex and regulated in part through antiviral interferons. However, the interferon-stimulated gene products that inhibit CoV are not well characterized2. Here, we show that interferon-inducible lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus E (LY6E) potently restricts cellular infection by multiple CoVs, including SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Mechanistic studies revealed that LY6E inhibits CoV entry into cells by interfering with spike protein-mediated membrane fusion. Importantly, mice lacking Ly6e in hematopoietic cells were highly susceptible to murine CoV infection. Exacerbated viral pathogenesis in Ly6e knockout mice was accompanied by loss of hepatic and splenic immune cells and reduction in global antiviral gene pathways. Accordingly, we found that Ly6e directly protects primary B cells and dendritic cells from murine CoV infection. Our results demonstrate that LY6E is a critical antiviral immune effector that controls CoV infection and pathogenesis. These findings advance our understanding of immune-mediated control of CoV in vitro and in vivo, knowledge that could help inform strategies to combat infection by emerging CoV.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, at the end of 2019 has resulted in widespread human infections across the globe. While genetically distinct from SARS-CoV, the etiological agent that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, both coronaviruses exhibit receptor binding domain (RBD) conservation and utilize the same host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for virus entry. Therefore, it will be important to test the cross-reactivity of antibodies that have been previously generated against the surface spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV in order to aid research on the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show that an immunogenic domain in the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV S is highly conserved in multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2. Consistently, four murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against this immunogenic SARS-CoV fragment were able to recognise the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 expressed in a mammalian cell line. Importantly, one of them (mAb 1A9) was demonstrated to detect S in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that mAbs targeting the S2 domain of SARS-CoV can cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 and this observation is consistent with the high sequence conservation in the S2 subunit. These cross-reactive mAbs may serve as tools useful for SARS-CoV-2 research as well as for the development of diagnostic assays for its associated coronavirus disease COVID-19.",

It is currently no specific viral protein targeted therapeutics yet. Viral nucleocapsid protein is a potential antiviral drug target, serving multiple critical functions during the viral life cycle. However, the structural information of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is yet to be clear. Herein, we have determined the 2.7 [A] crystal structure of the N-terminal RNA binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. Although overall structure is similar with other reported coronavirus nucleocapsid protein N-terminal domain, the surface electrostatic potential characteristics between them are distinct. Further comparison with mild virus type HCoV-OC43 equivalent domain demonstrates a unique potential RNA binding pocket alongside the {beta}-sheet core.

Hence, we annotated 73 ORs from an antennal transcriptome of the spruce bark beetle Ips typographus and report the functional characterization of two ORs (ItypOR46 and ItypOR49), which are selective for single enantiomers of the common bark beetle pheromone compounds ipsenol and ipsdienol, respectively. We use homology modeling and molecular docking to predict their binding sites. The importance of residues Tyr84 and Thr205 in ItypOR46 in the activation by ipsenol is experimentally supported, and hydrogen bonding appears key in pheromone binding. The biological significance of the characterized ORs positions them as prime targets for pest control and use in biosensors to detect bark beetle infestations.",

    "abstract": "The roles of epitranscriptomic modifications in mRNA regulation have recently received substantial attention, with appreciation growing for their phenotypically selective impacts within the animal. We adopted Drosophila melanogaster as a model system to study m6A, the most abundant internal modification of mRNA. Here, we report proteomic and functional analyses of fly m6A-binding proteins, confirming nuclear (YTHDC) and cytoplasmic (YTHDF) YTH domain proteins as the major m6A binders. Since all core m6A pathway mutants are viable, we assessed in vivo requirements of the m6A pathway in cognitive processes. Assays of short term memory revealed an age-dependent requirement of m6A writers working via YTHDF, but not YTHDC, comprising the first phenotypes assigned to Drosophila mutants of the cytoplasmic m6A reader. These factors promote memory via neural-autonomous activities, and are required in the mushroom body, the center for associative learning. To inform their basis, we mapped m6A from wild-type and mettl3 null mutant heads, allowing robust discrimination of Mettl3-dependent m6A sites. In contrast to mammalian m6A, which is predominant in 3 UTRs, Drosophila m6A is highly enriched in 5 UTRs and occurs in an adenosine-rich context. Genomic analyses demonstrate that Drosophila m6A does not directionally affect RNA stability, but is preferentially deposited on genes with low translational efficiency. However, functional tests indicate a role for m6A in translational activation, since we observe reduced nascent protein synthesis in mettl3-KO cells. Finally, we show that ectopic YTHDF can increase m6A target reporter output in an m6A-binding dependent manner, and that this activity is required for in vivo neural function of YTHDF in memory. Altogether, we provide the first tissue-specific m6A maps in this model organism and reveal selective behavioral and translational defects for m6A/YTHDF mutants.",

Up to March 3, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 89,000 people in China and other 66 countries across six continents. In this study, we used 10 new sequenced genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and combined 136 genomes from GISAID database to investigate the genetic variation and population demography through different analysis approaches (e.g. Network, EBSP, Mismatch, and neutrality tests). The results showed that 80 haplotypes had 183 substitution sites, including 27 parsimony-informative and 156 singletons. Sliding window analyses of genetic diversity suggested a certain mutations abundance in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2, which may be explaining the existing widespread. Phylogenetic analysis showed that, compared with the coronavirus carried by pangolins (Pangolin-CoV), the virus carried by bats (bat-RaTG13-CoV) has a closer relationship with SARS-CoV-2. The network results showed that SARS-CoV-2 had diverse haplotypes around the world by February 11. Additionally, 16 genomes, collected from Huanan seafood market assigned to 10 haplotypes, indicated a circulating infection within the market in a short term.
