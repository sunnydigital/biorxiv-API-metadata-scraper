    "abstract": "Thymic epithelial cells (TEC) control the selection of a T-cell repertoire reactive to pathogens but tolerant of self. While this process is known to involve the promiscuous expression of virtually the entire protein-coding gene repertoire the extent to which TEC recapitulate peripheral isoforms, and the mechanisms by which they do so, have remained largely unknown. We performed the first assembly-based transcriptomic census of transcript structures and splicing factor (SF) expression in mouse medullary TEC (mTEC) and 21 peripheral tissues. Mature mTEC expressed 60.1% of all protein-coding transcripts, more than was detected in any of the peripheral tissues. However, for genes with tissue-restricted expression, we found that mTEC produced fewer isoforms than did the relevant peripheral tissues. Analysis of exon inclusion revealed an absence of brain-specific micro-exons in mTEC. We did not find unusual numbers of novel transcripts in TEC and show that Aire, the facilitator of promiscuous gene expression, promotes usage of long transcripts but has only a limited impact on alternative splicing in mTEC. Comprehensive assessment of SF expression in mTEC identified a small set of non-promiscuously expressed SF genes amongst which we confirmed RBFOX to be present with AIRE in mTEC nuclei. Using a conditional loss of function approach, we show that Rbfox2 promotes mTEC development and regulates the alternative splicing of promiscuously expressed genes. These data indicate that TEC recommission a small number of peripheral SFs, including members of the Rbfox family, to generate a broad but selective representation of the peripheral splice isoform repertoire.",

    "abstract": "SPINK1 has been regarded as a reversible trypsinogen inhibitor for the inappropriate activation of trypsin, a key step in the initiation of acute pancreatitis (AP). However, the mechanisms of its action remains largely unclear and controversial. Here, we reported an unexpected effects of SPINK1 on inhibiting trypsinogen activation through the regulation of impaired autophagy in cerulein-stimulated AR42J cells, a well-established in vitro model of acute pancreatitis. Firstly, we found that the impaired autophagic flux was induced and trypsinogen activity enhanced in the above setting. Then, we showed that SPINK1 overexpression could inhibit the level of increased autophagic activity, improving the hindered autophagy flux, and significantly decreased the trypsinogen activity, whereas shRNA-caused downregulation of SPINK1 exacerbated the impairment of autophagic flux and trypsin activity, in the same cerulein-processed cells. More importantly, the trypsinogen activation in this model could be ameliorated by 3-Methyladenine(3-MA), an autophagy inhibitor. Thus, this study revealed, possibly for the first time, that SPINK1 greatly blocked the trypsinogen activation possibly through the modulation of impaired autophagy in cerulein-induced in vitro model of acute pancreatitis.",

    "abstract": "In this and the next paper of this series we apply the red cell model introduced in the previous paper to investigate the changes in RBC homeostasis during capillary transits and over the full circulatory lifespan of the cells. These are topics inaccessible to direct experimentation but rendered mature for a modelling approach by recent findings and by a large body of apparently unrelated early results which robustly constrain the parameter space offering the opportunity for an in depth study of the mechanisms involved. Capillary transit times vary between 0.5 and 1.5s during which the red blood cells squeeze and deform in the capillary stream transiently opening stress-gated PIEZO1 channels, creating minuscule quantal changes in RBC ion contents and volume. Widely accepted early views originally based on results from experimentally shear-stressed red cells suggested that quantal changes generated during capillary transits add up over time to generate the documented changes in RBC density during their long circulatory lifespan, the quantal hypothesis. Applying the new PIEZO1 extension of the RBC model (RCM) introduced in the previous paper we investigated in detail the changes in homeostatic variables that may be expected during single capillary transits resulting from transient PIEZO1 channel activation. The predicted quantal volume changes were infinitesimal in magnitude, biphasic in nature, and essentially irreversible within inter-transit periods. A sub-second transient PIEZO1 activation triggered a sharp swelling peak followed by a much slower recovery period towards lower-than-baseline volumes. The peak response was caused by net CaCl2 and fluid gain via PIEZO1 channels driven by the steep electrochemical inward Ca2+ gradient. The ensuing dehydration followed a complex time-course with sequential, but partially overlapping contributions by KCl loss via Ca2+-activated Gardos channels, PMCA mediated calcium extrusion and chloride efflux by the Jacobs-Steward mechanism. The change in relative cell volume predicted for single capillary transits was below 10-4, an infinitesimal volume change incompatible with a functional role in capillary flow. The biphasic response predicted by the RCM appears to conform to the quantal hypothesis, but whether its cumulative effects could account for the documented changes in density during RBC senescence required an investigation of the effects of myriad transits over the full period of circulatory lifespan, the subject of the next paper of this series.",

    "abstract": "The chemical modification of proteins refers to the covalent group reaction involved in their amino acid residues or chain ends which, in turn, change the molecular structure and function of the proteins. There are many types of molecular modifications in the human plasma proteome, such as phosphorylation, methylation, and acetylation. In this study, two groups of human plasma proteome at different age groups (old and young) were used to perform a comparison of global chemical modifications, as determined by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) combined with non-limiting modification identification algorithms. The sulfhydryl in the cysteine A total of 4 molecular modifications were found to have significant differences: the succinylation and phosphorylation modification of cysteine (Cys, C) and the modification of lysine (Lys, K) with threonine (Thr, T) were significantly higher in the old group than in the young group, while the carbamylation of lysine was lower in the young group. Cysteine residue is an important group for forming disulphide bonds and maintaining the structure of the protein. Differential cysteine-related sulfydryl modifications may cause structural and functional changes. Lysine is a basic amino acid, and the modification of its amino group will change the charge state of the protein, which may affect the structure and function of the protein. In summary, four types of protein chemical modifications and substitutes were found to be significantly different in the plasma proteome in different age groups and their probabilities of random generation are lower by passing random grouping test. We speculate that there is an increase in certain modified proteins in the blood of the old people which, in turn, changes the function of those proteins. This change may be one of the reasons why the old people are more likely than the young people to be at risk for age-related diseases, such as metabolic diseases, cerebral and cardiovascular diseases, and cancer.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIdentification of genes responsible for anatomical entities is a major requirement in many fields including developmental biology, medicine, and agriculture. Current wet-lab techniques used for this purpose, such as gene knockout, are high in resource and time consumption. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks are frequently used to predict disease genes for humans and gene candidates for molecular functions, but they are rarely used to predict genes for anatomical entities. This is because PPI networks suffer from network quality issues, which can be a limitation for their usage in predicting candidate genes for anatomical entities. We developed an integrative framework to predict candidate genes for anatomical entities by combining existing experimental knowledge about gene-anatomy relationships with PPI networks using anatomy ontology annotations. We expected this integration to improve the quality of the PPI networks and be better optimized to predict candidate genes for anatomical entities. We used existing Uberon anatomy entity annotations for zebrafish and mouse genes to construct gene networks by calculating semantic similarity between the genes. These  anatomy-based gene networks are semantic networks, as they are constructed based on the Uberon anatomy ontology annotations that are obtained from the experimental data in the literature. We integrated these anatomy-based gene networks with mouse and zebrafish PPI networks retrieved from the STRING database, and we compared the performance of their network-based candidate gene predictions.\n\nResultsAccording to candidate gene prediction performance evaluations tested under four different semantic similarity calculation methods (Lin, Resnik, Schlicker, and Wang), the integrated networks showed better receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and precision-recall curve performances than PPI networks for both zebrafish and mouse.\n\nConclusionIntegration of existing experimental knowledge about gene-anatomical entity relationships with PPI networks via anatomy ontology improves the network quality, which makes them better optimized for predicting candidate genes for anatomical entities.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTranscranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is emerging as a potentially powerful, non-invasive technique for focal brain stimulation. Recent animal work suggests, however, that TUS effects may be confounded by indirect stimulation of early auditory pathways.\n\nObjectiveWe aimed to investigate in human participants whether TUS elicits audible sounds and if these can be masked by an audio signal.\n\nMethodsIn 18 healthy participants, T1-weighted magnetic resonance brain imaging was acquired for 3D ultrasound simulations to determine optimal transducer placements and source amplitudes. Thermal simulations ensured that temperature rises were <0.5 {degrees}C at the target and <3 {degrees}C in the skull. To test for non-specific auditory activation, TUS (500 kHz, 300 ms burst, modulated at 1 kHz with 50% duty cycle) was applied to primary visual cortex and participants were asked to distinguish stimulation from non-stimulation trials. EEG was recorded throughout the task. Furthermore, ex-vivo skull experiments tested for the presence of skull vibrations during TUS.\n\nResultsWe found that participants can hear sound during TUS and can distinguish between stimulation and non-stimulation trials. This was corroborated by EEG recordings indicating auditory activation associated with TUS. Delivering an audio waveform to participants through earphones while TUS was applied reduced detection rates to chance level and abolished the TUS-induced auditory EEG signal. Ex vivo skull experiments demonstrated that sound is conducted through the skull at the pulse repetition frequency of the ultrasound.\n\nConclusionFuture studies using TUS in humans need to take this auditory confound into account and mask stimulation appropriately.",

    "abstract": "The maintenance of short-term memories is critical for survival in a dynamically changing world. Previous studies suggest that this memory can be stored in the form of persistent neural activity or using a synaptic mechanism, such as with short-term plasticity. Here, we compare the predictions of these two mechanisms to neural and behavioral measurements in a visual change detection task. Mice were trained to respond to changes in a repeated sequence of natural images while neural activity was recorded using two-photon calcium imaging. We also trained two types of artificial neural networks on the same change detection task as the mice. Following fixed pre-processing using a pretrained convolutional neural network, either a recurrent neural network (RNN) or a feedforward neural network with short-term synaptic depression (STPNet) was trained to the same level of performance as the mice. While both networks are able to learn the task, the STPNet model contains units whose activity are more similar to the in vivo data and produces errors which are more similar to the mice. When images are omitted, an unexpected perturbation which was absent during training, mice often do not respond to the omission but are more likely to respond to the subsequent image. Unlike the RNN model, STPNet also produces a similar pattern of behavior. These results suggest that simple neural adaptation mechanisms may serve as an important bottom-up memory signal in this task, which can be used by downstream areas in the decision-making process.\n\nAuthor SummaryAnimals have to adapt to environments with rich dynamics and maintain multiple types of memories. In this study, we focus on a visual change detection task in mice which requires short-term memory. Learning which features need to be maintained in short-term memory can be realized in a recurrent neural network by changing connections in the network, resulting in memory maintenance through persistent activity. However, in biological networks, a large diversity of time-dependent intrinsic mechanisms are also available. As an alternative to persistent neural activity, we find that learning to make use of internal adapting dynamics better matches both the observed neural activity and behavior of animals in this simple task. The presence of a large diversity of temporal traces could be one of the reasons for the diversity of cells observed. We believe that both learning to keep representations of relevant stimuli in persistent activity and learning to make use of intrinsic time-dependent mechanisms exist, and their relative use will be dependent on the exact task.",

    "abstract": "In December 2019, the first cases of infection with a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, were diagnosed in Wuhan, China. Due to international travel and human-to-human transmission, the virus spread rapidly inside and outside of China. Currently, there is no effective antiviral treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); therefore, research efforts are focused on the rapid development of vaccines and antiviral drugs. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease constitutes one of the most attractive antiviral drug targets. To address this emerging problem, we have synthesized a combinatorial library of fluorogenic substrates with glutamine in the P1 position. We used it to determine the substrate preferences of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 main proteases, using natural and a large panel of unnatural amino acids. On the basis of these findings, we designed and synthesized an inhibitor and two activity-based probes, for one of which we determined the crystal structure of its complex with the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Using this approach we visualized SARS-CoV-2 active Mpro within nasopharyngeal epithelial cells of a patient with active COVID-19 infection.

To identify regions of the protein that may have functions that are disrupted in disease, we carried out bioinformatic analyses of its conserved regions. An N-terminal region of around 650 amino-acid residues, present in SPG11 across a wide range of metazoan animals, was missing from many insect lineages. Evolutionary loss of this domain correlated with loss of its binding partner, the AP-5 adaptor complex, suggesting that its main function is interaction with AP-5 in intracellular trafficking, and that the remainder of SPG11 carries out AP-5-independent functions. At the C-terminus of SPG11, a spatacsin_C domain showed sequence similarity and predicted structural homology to the Vps16_C domain of the HOPS complex protein Vps16. It localized to acidic compartments, consistent with a role in endolysosomal or autolysosomal transport, like Vps16. Mass spectrometry analysis of binding partners of this domain identified membrane trafficking proteins, some SM proteins, and several aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Since mutations affecting SPG11 or aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases can both cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy (CMT) type 2, we suggest autolysosomal trafficking as a target process in CMT type 2.",
