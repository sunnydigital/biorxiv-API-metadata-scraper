    "abstract": "Optimal mating decisions depend on stable signaling systems because any independent changes in either the signal or its perception could carry a fitness cost. However, since the perception and production of specific mating signals are often mediated by different tissues and cell types, the genetic and cellular mechanisms that drive and maintain their coupling on the evolutionary and physiological timescales remain unknown for most animal species. Here, we show that in Drosophila melanogaster, sensory perception and synthesis of an inhibitory mating pheromone is regulated by the action of Gr8a, a member of the Gustatory receptor gene family. Particularly, Gr8a acts as a pheromone chemoreceptor in the sensory system of males and females, and, independently regulates pheromone synthesis in the male fat body and oenocytes. These data provide a relatively simple molecular explanation for how genetic coupling allows for the robust and stable flow of social information at the population level.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThird-generation sequencing technologies Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore allow the sequencing of long reads of tens of kbp, that are expected to solve various problems, such as contig and haplotype assembly, scaffolding, and structural variant calling. However, they also display high error rates that can reach 10 to 30%, for basic ONT and non-CCS PacBio reads. As a result, error correction is often the first step of projects dealing with long reads. As first long reads sequencing experiments produced reads displaying error rates higher than 15% on average, most methods relied on the complementary use of short reads data to perform correction, in a hybrid approach. However, these sequencing technologies evolve fast, and the error rate of the long reads now reaches 10 to 12%. As a result, self-correction is now frequently used as the first step of third-generation sequencing data analysis projects. As of today, efficient tools allowing to perform self-correction of the long reads are available, and recent observations suggest that avoiding the use of second-generation sequencing reads could bypass their inherent bias.\n\nResultsWe introduce CONSENT, a new method for the self-correction of long reads that combines different strategies from the state-of-the-art. More precisely, we combine a multiple sequence alignment strategy with the use of local de Bruijn graphs. Moreover, the multiple sequence alignment benefits from an efficient segmentation strategy based on k-mer chaining, which allows a considerable speed improvement. Our experiments show that CONSENT compares well to the latest state-of-the-art self-correction methods, and even outperforms them on real Oxford Nanopore datasets. In particular, they show that CONSENT is the only method able to efficiently scale to the correction of Oxford Nanopore ultra-long reads, and is able to process a full human dataset, containing reads reaching lengths up to 1.5 Mbp, in 15 days. Additionally, CONSENT also implements an assembly polishing feature, and is thus able to correct errors directly from raw long read assemblies. Our experiments show that CONSENT outperforms state-of-the-art polishing tools in terms of resource consumption, and provides comparable results. Moreover, we also show that, for a full human dataset, assembling the raw data and polishing the assembly afterwards is less time consuming than assembling the corrected reads, while providing better quality results.\n\nAvailability and implementationCONSENT is implemented in C++, supported on Linux platforms and freely available at https://github.com/morispi/CONSENT.\n\nContactpierre.morisse2@univ-rouen.fr",

    "abstract": "Neural networks in the brain can function reliably despite various sources of errors and noise present at every step of signal transmission. These sources include errors in the presynaptic inputs to the neurons, noise in synaptic transmission, and fluctuations in the neurons postsynaptic potentials. Collectively they lead to errors in the neurons outputs which are, in turn, injected into the network. Does unreliable network activity hinder fundamental functions of the brain, such as learning and memory retrieval? To explore this question, this article examines the effects of errors and noise on properties of biologically constrained networks of inhibitory and excitatory neurons involved in associative sequence learning. The associative learning problem is solved analytically and numerically, and it is also shown how memory sequences can be loaded into the network with a more biologically plausible perceptron-type learning rule. Interestingly, the results reveal that errors and noise during learning increase the probability of memory recall. There is a tradeoff between the capacity and reliability of stored memories, and, noise during learning is required for optimal retrieval of stored information. What is more, networks loaded with associative memories to capacity display many structural and dynamical features observed in local cortical circuits. Due to the similarities between the associative and brain networks, this article predicts that the connections originating from unreliable inhibitory and excitatory neurons or neuron classes in the cortex must be depressed or eliminated during learning, while the connections onto noisy neurons or neuron classes must have lower probabilities and higher weights.",

    "abstract": "Human populations in many countries have undergone a phase of demographic transition, characterized by a major reduction in fertility at a time of increased resource availability. A key stylized fact is that the reduction in fertility is preceded by a reduction in mortality and a consequent increase in population density. Various theories have been proposed to account for the demographic transition process, including maladaptation, increased parental investment in fewer offspring, and cultural evolution. None of these approaches, including formal cultural evolutionary models of the demographic transitions, have addressed a possible direct causal relationship between a reduction in mortality and the subsequent decline in fertility. We provide mathematical models in which low mortality favors the cultural selection of low fertility traits. This occurs because reduced mortality slows turnover in the model, which allows the cultural transmission advantage of low fertility traits to out-race their reproductive disadvantage. For mortality to be a crucial determinant of outcome, a cultural transmission bias is required where slow reproducers exert higher social influence. Computer simulations of our models that allow for exogenous variation in the death rate can reproduce the central features of the demographic transition process, including substantial reductions in fertility within only 1-3 generations. A model assuming continuous evolution of reproduction rates through imitation errors predicts fertility to fall below replacement levels, if death rates are sufficiently low. This can potentially explain the very low preferred family sizes in Western Europe.",

We previously demonstrated that whole genome expression is dynamically self-organized through the emergence of a critical point. Furthermore, it has been confirmed that this happens at both the cell-population and single-cell level through the physical principle of self-organized criticality.\n\nIn this paper, we further examine the genomic mechanism which determines cell-fate changes from embryo to cancer development. The state of the critical point, acting as the organizing center of cell-fate, determines whether the genome resides in a super- or sub-critical state. In the super-critical state, a specific stochastic perturbation can spread over the entire system through the  genome engine - an autonomous critical-control genomic system, whereas in the sub-critical state, the perturbation remains at a local level. We provide a consistent framework to develop a biological regulation transition theory demonstrating the cell-fate change.",

    "abstract": "Many major human pathogens are multi-host pathogens, able to infect other vertebrate species. Describing the general patterns of host-pathogen associations across pathogen taxa is therefore important to understand risk factors for human disease emergence. However, there is a lack of comprehensive curated databases for this purpose, with most previous efforts focusing on viruses. Here, we report the largest manually compiled host-pathogen association database, covering 2,595 bacteria and viruses infecting 2,656 vertebrate hosts. We also build a tree for host species using nine mitochondrial genes, giving a quantitative measure of the phylogenetic similarity of hosts. We find that the majority of bacteria and viruses are specialists infecting only a single host species, with bacteria having a significantly higher proportion of specialists compared to viruses. Conversely, multi-host viruses have a more restricted host range than multi-host bacteria. We perform multiple analyses of factors associated with pathogen richness per host species and the pathogen traits associated with greater host range and zoonotic potential. We show that factors previously identified as important for zoonotic potential in viruses--such as phylogenetic range, research effort, and being vector-borne--are also predictive in bacteria. We find that the fraction of pathogens shared between two hosts decreases with the phylogenetic distance between them. Our results suggest that host phylogenetic similarity is the primary factor for host-switching in pathogens.",

However, changes in environmental conditions and unforeseen interactions with the host cell can cause deviations from a desired function, resulting in the need for time-consuming reassembly to fix these issues. Here, we use a regulatory motif that controls transcription and translation to create genetic devices whose response functions can be dynamically tuned. This allows us, after construction, to shift the on and off states of a sensor by 4.5- and 28-fold, respectively, and modify genetic NOT and NOR logic gates to allow their transitions between states to be varied over a >6-fold range. In all cases, tuning leads to trade-offs in the fold-change and the ability to distinguish cellular states. This work lays the foundation for adaptive genetic circuits that can be tuned after their physical assembly to maintain functionality across diverse environments and design contexts.",

    "abstract": "The development of effective targeted therapies for the treatment of basal-like breast cancers remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate that BET inhibition induces a multi-faceted adaptive response program leading to MCL1 protein-driven evasion of apoptosis in breast cancers. Consequently, co-targeting MCL1 and BET is highly synergistic in in vitro and in vivo breast cancer models. Drug response and genomics analyses revealed that MCL1 copy number alterations, including low-level gains, are selectively enriched in basal-like breast cancers and associated with effective BET and MCL1 co-targeting. The mechanism of adaptive response to BET inhibition involves upregulation of critical lipid metabolism enzymes including the rate-limiting enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD). Changes in the lipid metabolism are associated with increases in cell motility and membrane fluidity as well as transitions in cell morphology and adhesion. The structural changes in the cell membrane leads to re-localization and activation of HER2/EGFR which can be interdicted by inhibiting SCD activity. Active HER2/EGFR, in turn, induces accumulation of MCL1 protein and therapeutic vulnerability to MCL1 inhibitors. The BET protein, lipid metabolism and receptor tyrosine kinase activation cascade is observed in patient cohorts of basal-like and HER2-amplified breast cancers. The high frequency of MCL1 chromosomal amplifications (>30%) and gains (>50%) in basal-like breast cancers suggests that BET and MCL1 co-inhibition may have therapeutic utility in this aggressive subtype.",

The OFC projects to primary visual cortex (V1), yet the function of this top-down projection is unclear. We find that optogenetic activation of OFC projection to V1 reduces the amplitude of V1 visual responses via the recruitment of local somatostatin-expressing (SST) interneurons. Using mice performing a Go/No-Go visual task, we show that the OFC projection to V1 mediates the outcome-expectancy modulation of V1 responses to the reward-irrelevant No-Go stimulus. Furthermore, V1-projecting OFC neurons reduce firing during expectation of reward. In addition, chronic optogenetic inactivation of OFC projection to V1 impairs, whereas chronic activation of SST interneurons in V1 improves the learning of Go/No-Go visual task, without affecting the immediate performance. Thus, OFC top-down projection to V1 is crucial to drive visual associative learning by modulating the response gain of V1 neurons to non-relevant stimulus.",

The outputs of these two systems summate to generate a total response strength. This cooperative model addresses the difference in the behavioral impact of ratio and interval schedules, the transition from goal-directed to habitual control with extended training, the persistence of goal-directed control under choice procedures and following extinction, among other phenomena.

We found that the characteristic cAMP peak differentiates between different carbon source transitions, and is rather homogenous among single-cells, especially for transitions to glucose. The peaks are mediated by a combination of extracellular sensing and intracellular metabolism. Moreover, the cAMP peak follows Webers law; its height scales with the relative, and not the absolute, change in glucose. Lastly, our results suggest that the cAMP peak height conveys information about prospective growth rates.

    "abstract": "Assemblies are large populations of neurons believed to imprint memories, concepts, words and other cognitive information. We identify a repertoire of operations on assemblies. These operations correspond to properties of assemblies observed in experiments, and can be shown, analytically and through simulations, to be realizable by generic, randomly connected populations of neurons with Hebbian plasticity and inhibition. Operations on assemblies include: projection (duplicating an assembly by creating a new assembly in a downstream brain area); reciprocal projection (a variant of projection also entailing synaptic connectivity from the newly created assembly to the original one); association (increasing the overlap of two assemblies in the same brain area to reflect cooccurrence or similarity of the corresponding concepts); merge (creating a new assembly with ample synaptic connectivity to and from two existing ones); and pattern-completion (firing of an assembly, with some probability, in response to the firing of some but not all of its neurons). Our analytical results establishing the plausibility of these operations are proved in a simplified mathematical model of cortex: a finite set of brain areas each containing n excitatory neurons, with random connectivity that is both recurrent (within an area) and afferent (between areas). Within one area and at any time, only k of the n neurons fire -- an assumption that models inhibition and serves to define both assemblies and areas -- while synaptic weights are modified by Hebbian plasticity, as well as homeostasis. Importantly, all neural apparatus needed for the functionality of the assembly operations is created on the fly through the randomness of the synaptic network, the selection of the k neurons with the highest synaptic input, and Hebbian plasticity, without any special neural circuits assumed to be in place. Assemblies and their operations constitute a computational model of the brain which we call the Assembly Calculus, occupying a level of detail intermediate between the level of spiking neurons and synapses, and that of the whole brain. As with high-level programming languages, a computation in the Assembly Calculus (that is, a coherent sequence of assembly operations accomplishing a task) can ultimately be reduced -- \"compiled down\" -- to computation by neurons and synapses; however, it would be far more cumbersome and opaque to represent the same computation that way. The resulting computational system can be shown, under assumptions, to be in principle capable of carrying out arbitrary computations. We hypothesize that something like it may underlie higher human cognitive functions such as reasoning, planning, and language. In particular, we propose a plausible brain architecture based on assemblies for implementing the syntactic processing of language in cortex, which is consistent with recent experimental results.",

Many researchers apply the existing methods without considering the topology of pathways or at least they have overlooked a significant part of the structure, which may reduce the accuracy and generalizability of the results. Developing a new approach while considering gene expression data and topological features like causal relations regarding edge directions will help the investigators to achieve more accurate results.\n\nResultsWe proposed a new pathway enrichment analysis based on Bayesian network (BNrich) as an approach in PEA. To this end, the cycles were eliminated in 187 KEGG human signaling pathways concerning intuitive biological rules and the Bayesian network structures were constructed. The constructed networks were simplified by the Least Absolute Shrinkage Selector Operator (LASSO), and their parameters were estimated using the gene expression data. We finally prioritize the impacted pathways by Fishers Exact Test on significant parameters. Our method integrates both edge and node related parameters to enrich modules in the affected signaling pathway network. In order to evaluate the proposed method, consistency, discrimination, false positive rate and empirical P-value criteria were calculated, and the results are compared to well-known enrichment methods such as signaling pathway impact analysis (SPIA), bi-level meta-analysis (BLMA) and topology-based pathway enrichment analysis (TPEA).\n\nAvailabilityThe R package is available on carn.",

    "abstract": "Cell surface transmembrane, extracellular, and secreted proteins are high value targets for immunophenotyping, drug development, and studies related to intercellular communication in health and disease. As the number of specific and validated affinity reagents that target this subproteome are limited, mass spectrometry (MS)-based approaches will continue to play a critical role in enabling discovery and quantitation of these molecules. Given the technical considerations that make MS-based cell surface proteome studies uniquely challenging, it can be difficult to select an appropriate experimental approach. To this end, we have integrated multiple prediction strategies and annotations into a single online resource, Compiled Interactive Resource for Extracellular and Surface Studies (CIRFESS). CIRFESS enables rapid interrogation of the human proteome to reveal the cell surface proteome theoretically detectable by current approaches and highlights where current prediction strategies provide concordant and discordant information. We applied CIRFESS to identify the percentage of various subsets of the proteome which are expected to be captured by targeted enrichment strategies, including two established methods and one that is possible but not yet demonstrated. These results will inform the selection of available proteomic strategies and development of new strategies to enhance coverage of the cell surface and extracellular proteome.

The individual proteins comprising the coated vesicles include clathrin heavy chain, clathrin light chain, and a variety of adaptor protein complexes. Much is known about the structures of the individual CCV components, but data are lacking about the structures of the fully assembled complexes together with membrane and in complex with cargo. Here we determined the structures of natively assembled CCVs in a variety of geometries. We show that the adaptor {beta}2-appendages crosslink adjacent CHC {beta}-propellers and that the appendage densities reside almost exclusively in CCV hexagonal faces. We resolve how AP2 and other associated factors in hexagonal faces form an assembly hub with an extensive web of interactions between neighboring {beta}-propellers and propose a structural model that explains how adaptor binding can direct the formation of pentagonal and hexagonal faces.",

Though long considered intractable, multiple studies now show that perceptual training can recover visual functions in chronic CB. A popular hypothesis is that training recruits intact extrageniculostriate pathways. Alternatively, training may induce plastic changes within spared regions of the damaged V1. Here, we linked changes in luminance detection sensitivity with retinotopic fMRI activity in eleven chronic CB patients, before and after extensive visual discrimination training. Our results show that the strength of spared V1 activity representing perimetrically blind-field locations before training predicts the amount of training-induced recovery of luminance detection sensitivity. Additionally, training caused an enlargement of population receptive fields in perilesional V1 cortex, which increased blind-field coverage. These findings uncover fundamental changes in perilesional V1 cortex underlying training-induced restoration of conscious luminance detection sensitivity in cortically-blind patients.",

Data were analyzed through GGE Biplot and BLUP (Best Linear Unbiased Prediction) and an average yield of 10.29 {+/-}3.51 t ha-1 of dry matter was obtained. BLUP accumulated greater variance than GGE Biplot in the first two components. In terms of productivity and stability values, both models have the same selection trend.

Population resequencing of 139 tea accessions from around the world was used to investigate the evolution of tea and to reveal the phylogenetic relationships among tea accessions. With the spread of tea cultivation, hybridization has increased the heterozygosity and wide-ranging gene flow among tea populations. Population genetics and transcriptomics analyses revealed that during domestication, the selection for disease resistance and flavor in C. sinensis var. sinensis populations has been stronger than that in C. sinensis var. assamica populations.

    "abstract": "K2P channels regulate nervous, cardiovascular, and immune system functions1,2 through the action of their selectivity filter (C-type) gate3-6. Although structural studies show K2P conformations that impact activity7-13, no selectivity filter conformational changes have been observed. Here, combining K2P2.1 (TREK-1) X-ray crystallography in different potassium concentrations, potassium anomalous scattering, molecular dynamics, and functional studies, we uncover the unprecedented, asymmetric, potassium-dependent conformational changes underlying K2P C-type gating. Low potassium concentrations evoke conformational changes in selectivity filter strand 1 (SF1), selectivity filter strand 2 (SF2), and the SF2-transmembrane helix 4 loop (SF2-M4 loop) that destroy the S1 and S2 ion binding sites and are suppressed by C-type gate activator ML335. Shortening the uniquely long SF2-M4 loop to match the canonical length found in other potassium channels or disrupting the conserved Glu234 hydrogen bond network supporting this loop blunts C-type gate response to various physical and chemical stimuli. Glu234 network destabilization also compromises ion selectivity, but can be reversed by channel activation, indicating that the ion binding site loss reduces selectivity similar to other channels14. Together, our data establish that C-type gating occurs through potassium-dependent order-disorder transitions in the selectivity filter and adjacent loops that respond to gating cues relayed through the SF2-M4 loop. These findings underscore the potential for targeting the SF2-M4 loop for the development of new, selective K2P channel modulators.",

However, questions remain regarding optimal dietary regime and underlying mechanism of lifespan extension. Here, we asked how glucose-enriched food extends the lifespan of Drosophila. We showed that glucose-dependent lifespan extension is independent of caloric restriction, or insulin activity, two established mechanisms of lifespan extension. Instead, we found that flies raised on glucose-enriched food increased the expression of cell junction proteins, and extended intestinal barrier integrity with age. Furthermore, chemical disruption of the intestinal barrier removed the lifespan extension associated with glucose-treatment, suggesting that glucose-enriched food prolongs adult viability by enhancing the intestinal barrier. We believe our data contribute to our understanding of intestinal health and may help efforts to develop preventative measures to limit the effects of aging and disease.",

The Worlds demand for animal-derived protein has been projected to double by 2050. As a result there is a resultant increase in livestock industries to meet this demand. While meat is generally consumed as a source of protein, processed cattle hide popularly known as \"Kanda\" in southeastern Nigeria is consumed as a substitute for meat though it may not necessarily provide the same level of nutritional value with meat. The method of processing this food delicacy (Kanda) by singeing with scrap tyre or firewood has opened the door for heavy metal and or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) contamination, thereby putting unsuspecting consumers at health risk. This study therefore investigated the effects of consuming scrap tyre-singed cattle hide and firewood singed cattle hide on the kidney, liver and heart of male Wistar rats. Consuming singed cattle hides significantly elevated some serum marker enzymes important in kidney, liver and heart damage i.e alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase, with the groups that were fed with the hide singed with scrap tyre showing severe elevations. Consuming the singed Kanda also significantly decreased the serum concentrations of K+, Na+, Cl-, and significantly increased HCO3- and urea concentration. An examination of the organ tissues also revealed serious morphological changes. In conclusion, consuming singed Kanda had detrimental effects on the vital organs studied.",

    "abstract": "It is now accepted that short-term deprivation of one eye in adults results in not only a post-deprivation strengthening of the vision in the previously deprived eye but also a deterioration in the vision of the previously non-patched eye. Such monocular deprivation of 1-2 hours induces changes that last approximately 30-90 minutes. There is some support for this neuroplastic effect being the consequence of a change in the contrast gain within the binocular circuity. What is not known is when these changes in gain are initiated. One possibility is that they are initiated only once the patch is removed. The other possibility is that they are the result of a slow build up from the moment the patch is first applied.\n\nIn this study, we measure monocular contrast detection thresholds of the non-deprived eye over time during the deprivation of the other eye. We show that contrast threshold increases over time during the deprivation of the other eye. This observation suggest that the patching effect is mediated by a slow build up over the deprivation period: reducing the vision of the non-deprived eye and enhancing the vision of the deprived eye reflecting reciprocal changes in sensitivity. These results highlight a hitherto unknown feature of human vision, namely that monocular vision per se is intrinsically unstable which is a consequence of the reciprocal inhibitory circuits that homeostatically regulate binocular vision. This questions a whole corpus of studies of visual function that rely on the assumption that monocular vision is intrinsically stable.",

    "abstract": "Channelrhodopsins guide algal phototaxis and are widely used as optogenetic probes for control of membrane potential with light. \"Bacteriorhodopsin-like\" cation channelrhodopsins (BCCRs) from cryptophytes differ in primary structure from other CCRs, lacking usual residues important for their cation conductance. Instead, BCCR sequences match more closely those of rhodopsin proton pumps, containing residues responsible for critical proton transfer reactions. We report 19 new BCCRs, which, together with the earlier 6 known members of this family, form three branches (subfamilies) of a phylogenetic tree. Here we show that the conductance mechanisms in two subfamilies differ with respect to involvement of the homolog of the proton donor in rhodopsin pumps. Two BCCRs from the genus Rhodomonas generate photocurrents that rapidly desensitize under continuous illumination. Using a combination of patch clamp electrophysiology, absorption and Raman spectroscopy, and flash photolysis, we found that the desensitization is due to rapid accumulation of a long-lived nonconducting intermediate of the photocycle with unusually blue-shifted absorption with a maximum at 330 nm. These observations reveal diversity within the BCCR family and contribute to deeper understanding of their independently evolved cation channel function.\n\nIMPORTANCECation channelrhodopsins, light-gated channels from flagellate green algae, are extensively used as optogenetic photoactivators of neurons in research and recently have progressed to clinical trials for vision restoration. However, the molecular mechanisms of their photoactivation remain poorly understood. We recently identified cryptophyte cation channelrhodopsins, structurally different from those of green algae, which have separately evolved to converge on light-gated cation conductance. This study reveals diversity within this new protein family and describes a subclade with unusually rapid desensitization that results in short transient photocurrents in continuous light. Such transient currents have not been observed in the green algae channelrhodopsins and are potentially useful in optogenetic protocols. Kinetic UV-vis spectroscopy and photoelectrophysiology reveal the desensitization is caused by rapid accumulation of a non-conductive photointermediate in the photochemical reaction cycle. The absorption maximum of the intermediate is 330 nm, the shortest wavelength reported in any rhodopsin, indicating a novel chromophore structure.",

The MRSA burden can be partially attributed to pathogen-specific characteristics of the circulating clones, but little was known about the S. aureus circulating clones in the Philippines.\n\nWe sequenced the whole genomes of 116 S. aureus isolates collected in 2013-2014 by the Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Program.

The CC30 genomes were related to the South West Pacific clone, but formed a distinct and diverse lineage, with evidence of global dissemination. We showed the independent acquisition of resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim across different locations and genetic clones, but mostly in pediatric patients with invasive infections.

The concordance between phenotypic and genotypic resistance was also determined.\n\nCarbapenem resistance was associated namely with loss-of function of the OprD porin, and acquisition of the metallo-{beta}-lactamase VIM. The concordance between phenotypic and genotypic resistance was 93.27% overall for 6 antibiotics in 3 classes, but varied widely between aminoglycosides. The population of P. aeruginosa in the Philippines was diverse, with clonal expansions of XDR genomes belonging to multi-locus sequence types ST235, ST244, ST309, and ST773. We found evidence of persistence or reintroduction of the predominant clone ST235 in one hospital, as well as transfer between hospitals. Most of the ST235 genomes formed a distinct Philippine lineage when contextualized with international genomes, thus raising the possibility that this is a lineage unique to the Philippines. This was further supported by long-read sequencing of one representative XDR isolate, which revealed the presence of an integron carrying multiple resistance genes, including blaVIM-2, with differences in gene composition and synteny to other P. aeruginosa class 1 integrons described before.\n\nWe produced the first comprehensive genomic survey of P. aeruginosa in the Philippines, which bridges the gap in genomic data from the Western Pacific region and will constitute the genetic background to contextualize ongoing prospective surveillance. Our results also highlight the importance of infection control interventions aimed to curtail the spread of international epidemic clone ST235 within the country.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic cells deploy autophagy to eliminate invading microbes. In turn, pathogens have evolved effector proteins to counteract antimicrobial autophagy. How and why adapted pathogens co-opt autophagy for their own benefit is poorly understood. The Irish famine pathogen Phythophthora infestans secretes the effector protein PexRD54 that selectively activates an unknown plant autophagy pathway, while antagonizing antimicrobial autophagy. Here we show that PexRD54 induces autophagosome formation by bridging small GTPase Rab8a-decorated vesicles with autophagic compartments labelled by the core autophagy protein ATG8CL. Rab8a is required for pathogen-triggered and starvation-induced but not antimicrobial autophagy, revealing that specific trafficking pathways underpin selective autophagy. We discovered that Rab8a contributes to basal immunity against P. infestans, but PexRD54 diverts a sub-population of Rab8a vesicles to lipid droplets that associate with autophagosomes. These are then diverted towards pathogen feeding structures that are accommodated within the host cells. We propose that PexRD54 mimics starvation-induced autophagy by channeling host endomembrane trafficking towards the pathogen interface possibly to acquire nutrients. This work reveals that effectors can interconnect independent host compartments to stimulate complex cellular processes that benefit the pathogen.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/000117v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (83K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bfc9fforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@166b5f8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@34d581org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ad397f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "SSP (simulation-based sampling protocol) is an R package that uses simulation of ecological data and dissimilarity-based multivariate standard error (MultSE) as an estimator of precision to evaluate the adequacy of different sampling efforts for studies that will test hypothesis using permutational multivariate analysis of variance. The procedure consists in simulating several extensive data matrixes that mimic some of the relevant ecological features of the community of interest using a pilot data set. For each simulated data, several sampling efforts are repeatedly executed and MultSE calculated. The mean value, 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles of MultSE for each sampling effort across all simulated data are then estimated and standardized regarding the lowest sampling effort. The optimal sampling effort is identified as that in which the increase in sampling effort do not improve the precision beyond a threshold value (e.g. 2.5 %). The performance of SSP was validated using real data, and in all examples the simulated data mimicked well the real data, allowing to evaluate the relationship MultSE - n beyond the sampling size of the pilot studies. SSP can be used to estimate sample size in a wide range of situations, ranging from simple (e.g. single site) to more complex (e.g. several sites for different habitats) experimental designs. The latter constitutes an important advantage, since it offers new possibilities for complex sampling designs, as it has been advised for multi-scale studies in ecology.",

None of the isolates was resistant to ceftriaxone or cefixime. The concordance between phenotypic and genotypic resistance was 92.38% overall for five antibiotics in four classes. Despite the small number of isolates studied, they were genetically diverse, as shown by the sequence types, the N. gonorrhoeae multiantigen sequence typing types and the tree. Comparison with global genomes placed the Philippine genomes within global lineage A and led to identification of an international transmission route.\n\nThis first genomic survey of N. gonorrhoeae isolates collected by ARSP will be used to contextualize prospective surveillance.

    "abstract": "The social environment strongly affects the physiological stress response in group living animals, which in turn can affect the immune system and increase susceptibility to parasites. Here, I investigate relationships between social behavior and gastrointestinal parasite product excretion in the carrion crow (Corvus corone). Individuals from a population of non-cooperatively breeding carrion crows excreted less samples containing coccidian oocysts when kept in larger groups (8 or 9 individuals) compared to those individuals kept in smaller groups (2 or 3 individuals). Lower-ranking individuals excreted more samples containing parasite oocysts compared to higher-ranking individuals. The strength of affiliative relationships and number of related individuals in the group did not relate to the proportion of droppings containing coccidian oocysts. The present results confirm an association between social environment and parasite excretion patterns in carrion crows, but the patterns described in the present study differ from previously published data derived from a group of cooperatively breeding crows. This illustrates that differences between the social systems of carrion crows might result in different associations between the social environment and parasite product excretion patterns.\n\nSignificance statementOne major cost of group living is an increase in susceptibility to parasites, however not all group living animals are affected by this in the same way. A better understanding how social behavior is associated with parasite burden can help to better understand evolution of group living. This study attempts to investigate associations between dominance rank, affiliative relationships as well as groups size and gastrointestinal parasite product excretion in a group of captive carrion crows. Lower-ranking individuals excreted more samples containing parasite oocysts compared to higher-ranking individuals, confirming an association between social relationships within the groups (for example dominance rank) and parasite excretion patterns.",

    "abstract": "The mineralization of nitrogen (N) and especially the regeneration of ammonium are critical processes performed by bacteria in aquatic ecosystems. Quantifying these processes is complicated because bacteria simultaneously consume and produce ammonium. Here we use experimental data on the effects of the molecular composition of the supplied substrates, combined with a classical stoichiometric model of ammonium regeneration, to demonstrate how the quantification of these processes can be improved. We manipulated a batch culture experiment with an isolated bacterial community by adding three different types of N substrates: dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN, nitrate), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON, amino acid) and a mixture of DIN and DON. With such experiment set-up, the ammonium regeneration per se could be easily tracked without using complicated methods (e.g. isotope dilution). We compared the experimental data with the predictions of Goldman et al model (1987) as well as with a revised version, using the measured consumption carbon:nitrogen ratio (C:N ratio), rather than an estimated consumption ratio. We found that, for all substrates, and in particular, mixed substrates where C and N are partially dissociated between different molecules, estimates of ammonium regeneration rates can be improved by measuring the actual consumption C: N ratio.\n\nImportanceMeasuring bacterial ammonium regeneration in natural aquatic ecosystem is difficult because bacteria in the field simultaneously consume and produce ammonium. In our experimental design, we used nitrate as the inorganic nitrogen substrate. This way, we could measure separately the uptake and excretion of inorganic nitrogen by bacteria without incorporating cumbersome methods such as isotope dilution. Our experiment allowed us to evaluate the accuracy of various stoichiometric models for the estimation of net bacterial nitrogen regeneration.

Although ZmCLA4 was identified to shape plant architecture by affecting leaf angle, the detailed regulatory mechanism of ZmCLA4 in maize remains unclear. ZmCLA4 was identified as a transcriptional repressor using the Gal4-LexA/UAS system and transactivation analysis in yeast. The DNA affinity purification (DAP)-seq assay showed that ZmCLA4 not only acts as a repressor containing the EAR motif (CACCGGAC), but was also found to have two new motifs, CCGARGS and CDTCNTC. On analyzing the ZmCLA4-bound targeted genes, we found that ZmCLA4, as a cross node of multiple plant hormone-mediated pathways, directly bound to ARF22 and IAA26 to regulate auxin transport and mediated brassinosteroid signaling by directly binding to BZR3 and 14-3-3. ZmCLA4 bound two WRKY genes involved with abscisic acid, two genes (CYP75B1, CYP93D1) involved with jasmonic acid, B3 involved in the response to ethylene, and thereby negatively regulated leaf angle formation. We built a new regulatory network for the ZmCLA4 gene controlling leaf angle in maize, which contributed to the understanding of ZmCLA4s regulatory mechanism and will improve grain yields by facilitating optimization of plant architecture.",

Taxonomically diverse bacteria and phytoplankton can produce extracellular superoxide during laboratory cultivation6-11. Understanding the physiological reasons for extracellular superoxide production by aerobes in the environment is a crucial question yet not fully solved. Here, we showed that iron-starving Arthrobacter sp. QXT-31 (referred to as A. QXT-31 hereafter) secreted a type of siderophore (deferoxamine, DFO), which provoked extracellular superoxide production by carbon-starving A. QXT-31 when carbon sources were recovered. Several other siderophores also demonstrated similar effects. RNA-Seq data hinted that DFO stripped iron from iron-bearing proteins in the electron transfer chain (ETC) of metabolically active A. QXT-31, resulting in electron leakage from the electron-rich (resulting from carbons source metabolism) ETC and superoxide production. Considering that most aerobes secrete siderophore(s)12 and often suffer from carbon starvation in the environment, certain aerobes are expected to produce extracellular superoxide when carbon source(s) recover/fluctuate, thus influencing the microbial community and cycling of many elements. In addition, an artificial iron-chelator (diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid, DTPA) was widely used in microbial superoxide quantification. Our results showed that DTPA provoked superoxide production by A. QXT-31 and highlighted its potential interference in microbial superoxide quantification.",

    "abstract": "The cerebellum has long been considered crucial for supervised motor learning and its optimization1-3. However, new evidence has also implicated the cerebellum in reward based learning4-8, executive function9-12, and frontal-like clinical deficits13. We recently showed that the simple spikes of Purkinje cells (P-cells) in the mid-lateral cerebellar hemisphere (Crus I and II) encode a reinforcement error signal when monkeys learn to associate arbitrary symbols with hand movements4. However, it is unclear if the cerebellum is necessary for any process beyond motor learning. To investigate if the mid-lateral cerebellum is actually necessary for learning visuomotor associations, we reversibly inactivated the mid-lateral cerebellum of two primates with muscimol while they learned to associate arbitrary symbols with hand movements. Here we show that cerebellar inactivation impaired the monkeys ability to learn new associations, although it had no effect on the monkeys performance on a task with overtrained symbols. A computational model corroborates our results. Cerebellar inactivation increased the reaction time, but there were no deficits in any motor kinematics such as the hand movement, licking or eye movement. There was no loss of function when we inactivated a more anterior region of the cerebellum that is implicated in motor control. We suggest that the mid-lateral cerebellum, which provides a reinforcement learning error signal4, is necessary for visuomotor association learning. Our results have implications for the involvement of cerebellum in cognitive control, and add critical constraints to brain models of non-motor learning14,15.",

    "abstract": "Although metabolic and sleep disturbances are commonly associated, the underlying processes are not yet fully defined. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), an anabolic hormone that shows a circadian pattern in the circulation and activity-dependent entrance in the brain, is associated to sleep regulation along evolution. However, its role in this universal homeostatic process remains poorly understood. We now report that the activity of orexin neurons, a discrete cell population in the lateral hypothalamus that is involved in the circadian sleep/wake cycle and arousal, is modulated by circulating IGF-I. Furthermore, mice with blunted IGF-I receptor activity in orexin neurons have lower levels of orexin in the hypothalamus, show altered electrocorticographic patterns with predominant slow wave activity, reduced onset-sleep latency, and less transitions between sleep and awake stages. Collectively, these results extend the role of this pleiotropic growth factor to shaping sleep architecture through regulation of orexin neurons. We speculate that poor sleep quality associated to diverse conditions may be related to disturbed brain IGF-I input to orexin neurons.",

    "abstract": "The astrocyte, a major glial cell type, is involved in formation and maturation of synapses, and thus contributes to sustainable synaptic transmission between neurons. Given that the animals in the higher phylogenetic tree have brains with higher density of glial cells with respect to neurons, there is a possibility that the relative astrocytic density directly influences synaptic transmission. However, the notion has not been tested thoroughly. Here we addressed it, by using a primary culture preparation where single hippocampal neurons are surrounded by a variable but countable number of cortical astrocytes in dot-patterned microislands, and recording synaptic transmission by patch-clamp electrophysiology. Neurons with a higher astrocytic density showed a higher amplitude of evoked excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) than that of neurons with a lower astrocytic density. The size of readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles per neuron was significantly higher. The frequency of spontaneous synaptic transmission (miniature EPSC) was higher, but the amplitude was unchanged. The number of morphologically identified glutamatergic synapses was unchanged, but the number of functional ones was increased, indicating a lower ratio of presynaptically silent synapses. Taken together, the higher astrocytic density enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission by increasing the number of functional synapses through presynaptic un-silencing.",

    "abstract": "Emerging evidence shows that cells are able to sense and store a memory of their past mechanical environment. Since existing mechanotransduction models are based on adhesion and cytoskeletal dynamics that occurs over seconds and minutes, they do not capture memory observed over days or weeks. We postulate that transcriptional activity and epigenetic plasticity, upstream of adhesion-based signaling, need to be invoked to explain long-term mechanical memory. Here, we present a theory for mechanical memory in cells governed by three key components. First, cells on a stiff matrix are primed by a transcriptional reinforcement of cytoskeletal signaling. Second, longer stiff-priming progressively produces more memory-regulating factors and reduces epigenetic plasticity. Third, when stiff-primed cells move to soft matrix, the reduced epigenetic plasticity blocks new transcription required for cellular adaptation to the new matrix. This stalled transcriptional state gives rise to memory. We validate this model against previous experimental findings of memory storage and decay in epithelial cell migration and stem cell differentiation. We also predict wide-ranging memory responses for different cell types of varying protein kinetics and priming conditions. This theoretical framework for mechanical memory expands the timescales of mechanotransduction captured by conventional models by integrating cytoskeletal signaling with transcriptional activity and epigenetic plasticity. Our model predictions explain mechanical memory and propose new experiments to test spatiotemporal regulation of cellular memory in diverse contexts ranging from cell differentiation to migration and growth.",

    "abstract": "The peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, Pin1, acts as a unified signaling hub that is exploited in cancer to activate oncogenes and inactivate tumor suppressors, in particular through up-regulation of c-Myc target genes. However, despite considerable efforts, Pin1 has remained an elusive drug target. Here, we screened an electrophilic fragment library to discover covalent inhibitors targeting Pin1s active site nucleophile - Cys113, leading to the development of Sulfopin, a double-digit nanomolar Pin1 inhibitor. Sulfopin is highly selective for Pin1, as validated by two independent chemoproteomics methods, achieves potent cellular and in vivo target engagement, and phenocopies genetic knockout of Pin1. Although Pin1 inhibition had a modest effect on viability in cancer cell cultures, Sulfopin induced downregulation of c-Myc target genes and reduced tumor initiation and tumor progression in murine and zebrafish models of MYCN-driven neuroblastoma. Our results suggest that Sulfopin is a suitable chemical probe for assessing Pin1-dependent pharmacology in cells and in vivo. Moreover, these studies indicate that Pin1 should be further investigated as a potential cancer target.",

    "abstract": "During aging, the regenerative capacity of muscle stem cells (MuSCs) decreases, diminishing the ability of muscle to repair following injury. We performed a small molecule library screen and discovered that the proliferation and expansion of aged MuSCs is regulated by signal transduction pathways organized by the primary cilium, a cellular protrusion that serves as a sensitive sensory organelle. Abolishing MuSC cilia in vivo severely impaired injury-induced muscle regeneration. In aged muscle, a cell intrinsic defect in MuSC ciliation leading to impaired Hedgehog signaling was associated with the decrease in regenerative capacity. This deficit could be overcome by exogenous activation of Hedgehog signaling which promoted MuSC expansion, both in vitro and in vivo. Delivery of the small molecule Smoothened agonist (SAG) to muscles of aged mice restored regenerative capacity leading to increased strength post-injury. These findings provide fresh insights into the signaling dysfunction in aging and identify the ciliary Hedgehog signaling pathway as a potential therapeutic target to counter the loss of muscle regenerative capacity which accompanies aging.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic flagella undergo different beat types necessary for their function. The single flagellum on Leishmania parasites, for example, undergoes a symmetric tip-to-base beat for forward swimming and an asymmetric base-to-tip beat to rotate the cell. Asymmetric beats are most commonly associated with multi-ciliated tissues or organisms where the asymmetry has a constant polarisation. We asked whether this also holds for the single Leishmania flagellum. To do so, we used high frame rate dual colour fluorescence microscopy to visualise intracellular and intraflagellar structure in live swimming cells. This showed that the asymmetric Leishmania beat has a fixed polarisation. As in Chlamydomonas, this asymmetry arose from an asymmetric static curvature combined with a symmetric dynamic curvature. Some axoneme protein deletion mutants give flagella which retain static curvature, but lack dynamic curvature. We saw that these retain a fixed polarisation. Similarly, deletion mutants which disrupt vital asymmetric extra-axonemal and rootlet-like flagellum-associated structures also retain a fixed polarisation. This indicated that beat asymmetry does not originate from rootlet-like and extra-axonemal structures and is likely intrinsic to either the nine-fold rotational symmetry of the axoneme structure or due to differences between the outer doublet decorations.",

    "abstract": "Cold seeps and hydrothermal vents deliver large amounts of methane and other gaseous alkanes into marine surface sediments. Consortia of archaea and partner bacteria thrive on the oxidation of these alkanes and its coupling to sulfate reduction. The inherently slow growth of the involved organisms and the lack of pure cultures have impeded the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of archaeal alkane degradation. Here, using hydrothermal sediments of the Guaymas Basin (Gulf of California) and ethane as substrate we cultured microbial consortia of a novel anaerobic ethane oxidizer Candidatus Ethanoperedens thermophilum (GoM-Arc1 clade) and its partner bacterium Candidatus Desulfofervidus auxilii previously known from methane-oxidizing consortia. The sulfate reduction activity of the culture doubled within one week, indicating a much faster growth than in any other alkane-oxidizing archaea described before. The dominance of a single archaeal phylotype in this culture allowed retrieving a closed genome of Ca. Ethanoperedens, a sister genus of the recently reported ethane oxidizer Candidatus Argoarchaeum. The metagenome-assembled genome of Ca. Ethanoperedens encoded for a complete methanogenesis pathway including a methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) that is highly divergent from those of methanogens and methanotrophs. Combined substrate and metabolite analysis showed ethane as sole growth substrate and production of ethyl-coenzyme M as activation product. Stable isotope probing showed that the enzymatic mechanisms of ethane oxidation in Ca. Ethanoperedens is fully reversible, thus its enzymatic machinery has potential for the biotechnological development of microbial ethane production from carbon dioxide.\n\nIMPORTANCEIn the seabed gaseous alkanes are oxidized by syntrophic microbial consortia that thereby reduce fluxes of these compounds into the water column. Because of the immense quantities of seabed alkane fluxes, these consortia are key catalysts of the global carbon cycle. Due to their obligate syntrophic lifestyle, the physiology of alkane-degrading archaea remains poorly understood. We have now cultivated a thermophilic, relatively fast-growing ethane oxidizer in partnership with a sulfate-reducing bacterium known to aid in methane oxidation, and have retrieved the first complete genome of a short-chain alkane-degrading archaeon. This will greatly enhance the understanding of non-methane alkane activation by non-canonical methyl-coenzyme M reductase enzymes, and provide insights into additional metabolic steps and the mechanisms underlying syntrophic partnerships. Ultimately, this knowledge could lead to the biotechnological development of alkanogenic microorganisms to support the carbon neutrality of industrial processes.\n\nEtymologyEthanoperedens. ethano, (new Latin): pertaining to ethane; peredens (Latin): consuming, devouring; thermophilum. (Greek): heat-loving.

    "abstract": "The recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) virus has highlighted the need for fast and efficacious vaccine development. Stimulation of a proper immune response that leads to protection is highly dependent on presentation of epitopes to circulating T-cells via the HLA complex. SARS-CoV-2 is a large RNA virus and testing of all overlapping peptides in vitro to deconvolute an immune response is not feasible. Therefore HLA-binding prediction tools are often used to narrow down the number of peptides to test. We tested 19 epitope-HLA-binding prediction tools, and using an in vitro peptide MHC stability assay, we assessed 777 peptides that were predicted to be good binders across 11 MHC allotypes. In this investigation of potential SARS-CoV-2 epitopes we found that current prediction tools vary in performance when assessing binding stability, and they are highly dependent on the MHC allotype in question. Designing a COVID-19 vaccine where only a few epitope targets are included is therefore a very challenging task. Here, we present 174 SARS-CoV-2 epitopes with high prediction binding scores, validated to bind stably to 11 HLA allotypes. Our findings may contribute to the design of an efficacious vaccine against COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented need for rapid diagnostic testing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend a standard assay that includes an RNA extraction step from a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab followed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to detect the purified SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The current global shortage of RNA extraction kits has caused a severe bottleneck to COVID-19 testing. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected from NP samples via a direct RT-qPCR assay that omits the RNA extraction step altogether, and tested this hypothesis on a series of blinded clinical samples. The direct RT-qPCR approach correctly identified 92% of NP samples (n = 155) demonstrated to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by traditional clinical diagnostic RT-qPCR that included an RNA extraction. Thus, direct RT-qPCR could be a front-line approach to identify the substantial majority of COVID-19 patients, reserving a repeat test with RNA extraction for those individuals with high suspicion of infection but an initial negative result. This strategy would drastically ease supply chokepoints of COVID-19 testing and should be applicable throughout the world.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2). We have performed an integrated sequence-based analysis of SARS-CoV2 genomes from different geographical locations in order to identify its unique features absent in SARS-CoV and other related coronavirus family genomes, conferring unique infection, facilitation of transmission, virulence and immunogenic features to the virus. The phylogeny of the genomes yields some interesting results. Systematic gene level mutational analysis of the genomes has enabled us to identify several unique features of the SARS-CoV2 genome, which includes a unique mutation in the spike surface glycoprotein (A930V (24351C>T)) in the Indian SARS-CoV2, absent in other strains studied here. We have also predicted the impact of the mutations in the spike glycoprotein function and stability, using computational approach. To gain further insights into host responses to viral infection, we predict that antiviral host-miRNAs may be controlling the viral pathogenesis. Our analysis reveals nine host miRNAs which can potentially target SARS-CoV2 genes. Interestingly, the nine miRNAs do not have targets in SARS and MERS genomes. Also, hsa-miR-27b is the only unique miRNA which has a target gene in the Indian SARS-CoV2 genome. We also predicted immune epitopes in the genomes",

    "abstract": "A recent outbreak of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, has spread rapidly all over the world. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is another deadly virus and causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Rapid and early detection of these viruses will facilitate early intervention and reduce disease transmission risk. Here, we present an All-In-One Dual CRISPR-Cas12a (termed \"AIOD-CRISPR\") assay method for simple, rapid, ultrasensitive, one-pot, and visual detection of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and HIV virus. In our AIOD CRISPR assay, a pair of crRNAs was introduced to initiate dual CRISPR-Cas12a detection and improve detection sensitivity. The AIOD-CRISPR assay system was successfully utilized to detect nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV with a sensitivity of few copies. Also, it was evaluated by detecting HIV-1 RNA extracted from human plasma samples, achieving a comparable sensitivity with real-time RT-PCR method. Thus, our method has a great potential for developing next-generation point-of-care molecular diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "An outbreak of a novel coronavirus, now named SARS-CoV-2, causing respiratory disease and a [~]2% case fatality rate started in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Following unprecedented rapid global spread, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Although data on disease in humans are emerging at a steady pace, certain aspects of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 can only be studied in detail in animal models, where repeated sampling and tissue collection is possible. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 causes respiratory disease in infected rhesus macaques, with disease lasting 8-16 days. Pulmonary infiltrates, a hallmark of human disease, were visible in lung radiographs of all animals. High viral loads were detected in swabs from the nose and throat of all animals as well as in bronchoalveolar lavages; in one animal we observed prolonged rectal shedding. Taken together, the rhesus macaque recapitulates moderate disease observed in the majority of human cases. The establishment of the rhesus macaque as a model of COVID-19 will increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease and will aid development and testing of medical countermeasures.",

    "abstract": "We present the first genetic characterization of a COVID-19 cluster in Europe using metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS). Despite low viral loads, the mNGS workflow used herein allowed to characterize the whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV2 isolated from an asymptomatic patient, in 2 clinical samples collected 1 day apart. Comparison of these sequences suggests viral evolution with development of quasispecies. In addition, the present workflow identified a new deletion in nsp2 (Asp268Del) which was found in all 3 samples originating from this cluster as well as in 37 other viruses collected in England and in Netherlands, suggesting the spread of this deletion in Europe. The impact of Asp268Del on SARS-CoV-2 transmission and pathogenicity, as well as on PCR performances and anti-viral strategy should be rapidly evaluated in further studies.",

    "abstract": "To ultimately combat the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, it is desired to develop an effective and safe vaccine against this highly contagious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Our literature and clinical trial survey showed that the whole virus, as well as the spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and membrane protein, have been tested for vaccine development against SARS and MERS. We further used the Vaxign reverse vaccinology tool and the newly developed Vaxign-ML machine learning tool to predict COVID-19 vaccine candidates. The N protein was found to be conserved in the more pathogenic strains (SARS/MERS/COVID-19), but not in the other human coronaviruses that mostly cause mild symptoms. By investigating the entire proteome of SARS-CoV-2, six proteins, including the S protein and five non-structural proteins (nsp3, 3CL-pro, and nsp8-10) were predicted to be adhesins, which are crucial to the viral adhering and host invasion. The S, nsp3, and nsp8 proteins were also predicted by Vaxign-ML to induce high protective antigenicity. Besides the commonly used S protein, the nsp3 protein has not been tested in any coronavirus vaccine studies and was selected for further investigation. The nsp3 was found to be more conserved among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV than among 15 coronaviruses infecting human and other animals. The protein was also predicted to contain promiscuous MHC-I and MHC-II T-cell epitopes, and linear B-cell epitopes localized in specific locations and functional domains of the protein. Our predicted vaccine targets provide new strategies for effective and safe COVID-19 vaccine development.",

    "abstract": "It is only after recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy that is now possible to describe at high resolution structures of large macromolecules that do not crystalize. Purified 30S subunits interconvert between the \"active\" and \"inactive\" conformations. The active conformation was described by crystallography in the early 2000s, but the structure of the inactive form at high resolution remains unsolved. Here we used cryo-electron microscopy to obtain the structure of the inactive conformation of the 30S subunit to 3.6[A] resolution and study its motions. In the inactive conformation, three nucleotides at the 3 end of the 16S rRNA cause the region of helix 44 forming the decoding center to adopt an unlatched conformation and the 3 end of the 16S rRNA positions similarly to the mRNA during translation. Incubation of inactive 30S subunits at 42 {degrees}C reverts these structural changes. The position adopted by helix 44 dictates the most prominent motions of the 30S subunit. We found that extended exposures to low magnesium concentrations induces unfolding of large rRNA structural domains. The air-water interface to which ribosome subuints are exposed during sample preparation also peel off some ribosomal proteins. Overall this study provides new insights about the conformational space explored by the 30S ribosomal subunit when the ribosomal particles are free in solution.",

    "abstract": "Methods for capturing the folding dynamics of functionally important RNAs, especially large RNAs, have relied primarily on global measurements of structure or on per-nucleotide chemical probing. These approaches infer, but do not directly measure, through-space tertiary interactions. Here we introduce trimethyloxonium (TMO) as a chemical probe for RNA. TMO enables time-resolved, single-molecule, through-space structure probing of RNA folding using a correlated chemical probing framework. TMO methylates RNA about 90 times faster than the widely used dimethyl sulfate probe, allowing structure interrogation on the second time scale. We used TMO to monitor folding of the RNase P RNA - a functional RNA with extensive long-range and noncanonical interactions - by direct measurement of through-space tertiary interactions in a time-resolved way. Time-dependent correlation changes directly revealed the central role of a long-range tertiary loop-loop interaction that guides native RNA folding. Single-molecule, time-resolved RNA structure probing with TMO is poised to reveal a wide range of dynamic RNA folding processes and principles of RNA folding.",
