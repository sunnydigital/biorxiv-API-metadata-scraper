    "abstract": "RNA testing using RT-PCR can provide direct evidence for diagnoses of COVID-19 which has brought unexpected disasters and changes to our human society. However, the absorption of cotton swab for RNA lysates may lead to a low concentration of detectable RNA, which might be one of the main reasons for the unstable positive detecting rate. We designed and manufactured a kind of silicone swab with concave-convex structure, and further compared the effects of silicone and cotton swab on RNA extraction. Principal component analysis and Paired Wilcoxcon test suggested that a higher RNA concentration and A260/A280 would be obtained using silicone swab. The results indicated that our silicone swab had a more excellent ability to sample than the cotton swab, characterized by the higher quantity and quality of extracted RNA. Thus, we advised that the current cotton swabs need to be improved urgently in COVID-19 diagnoses and the process of \"sample collection\" and \"sample pre-processing\" must be standardized and emphasized.\n\nHighlightsThe current cotton swabs need to be improved urgently in COVID-19 screening.",

    "abstract": "Many of the proteins produced by SARS-CoV-2 have related counterparts across the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) family. One such protein is non-structural protein 9 (Nsp9), which is thought to mediate both viral replication and virulence. Current understanding suggests that Nsp9 is involved in viral genomic RNA reproduction. Nsp9 is thought to bind RNA via a fold that is unique to this class of betacoronoaviruses although the molecular basis for this remains ill-defined. We sought to better characterise the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 protein and subsequently solved its X-ray crystal structure, in an apo-form and, unexpectedly, in a peptide-bound form with a sequence originating from a rhinoviral 3C protease sequence (LEVL). The structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 revealed the high level of structural conservation within the Nsp9 family. The exogenous peptide binding site is close to the dimer interface and impacted on the relative juxtaposition of the monomers within the homodimer. Together we have established a protocol for the production of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9, determined its structure and identified a peptide-binding site that may warrant further study from the perspective of understanding Nsp9 function.",

    "abstract": "Developmental and behavioral plasticity allow animals to prioritize alternative genetic programs during fluctuating environments. Behavioral remodeling may be acute in animals that interact with host organisms, since reproductive adults and the developmentally arrested larvae often have different ethological needs for chemical stimuli. To understand the genes that coordinate development and behavior, we used the nematode model Pristionchus pacificus to characterize mutants that inappropriately enter developmental diapause to become dauer larvae (Daf-c). We found several key olfactory differences between P. pacificus and C. elegans Daf-c dauers. In addition, the two P. pacificus Daf-c alleles disrupt steroid synthesis required for proper regulation of the conserved canonical steroid hormone receptor DAF-12, whose dauer-constitutive and cuticle exsheathment phenotypes can be rescued by the feeding of {Delta}7-dafachronic acid. One allele, csu60, has a deletion in the sole HydroxySteroid Dehydrogenase (HSD) in P. pacificus. Both hsd-2(csu60) adults and dauers show enhanced attraction to a beetle pheromone, possibly due to the heterochronic activation of dauer-specific neuronal development in the adults. Surprisingly, this enhanced odor attraction acts independently of daf-12, revealing unexpected targets of steroid hormones regulating ecdysis and olfaction in P. pacificus.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe remarkable evolutionary success of nematodes can be attributed to their dispersal ability as stress-resistant dauer larvae and the equivalent parasitic infective larvae. The decision to enter dauer development is regulated by a conserved steroid hormone receptor that receives multiple external and internal cues, though the extent in which these cues also coordinate other physiological and behavioral processes is not well understood in divergent species. We used the insect-associated nematode Pristionchus pacificus to genetically dissect two mutants that form dauers inappropriately, and found that one mutation in a steroidogenic enzyme, Ppa-hsd-2, is predicted to abolish the biosynthesis of the hormones needed to negatively regulate dauer entry when food is available. Unexpectedly, Ppa-HSD-2 is also required to properly complete the dauer larval molt, known as exsheathment, as well as to confer differences in adult versus dauer larvae chemotaxis behavior towards a host pheromone. Given that dauers are the host-seeking stage of parasitic nematodes, hormonal disruption represents a tenable target for biological control.",

    "abstract": "Plants respond to changes in ultraviolet (UV) radiation via morphological and physiological changes. Among the variety of plant UV-responses, the synthesis of UV-absorbing flavonoids constitutes an effective non-enzymatic mechanism to mitigate photoinhibitory and photooxidative damage caused by UV stress, either reducing the penetration of incident UV radiation or acting as quenchers of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, we designed a UV-exclusion experiment to investigate the effects of UV radiation in Silene littorea. We spectrophotometrically quantified concentrations of both anthocyanins and non-anthocyanin flavonoids (flavones) in petals, calyces, leaves and stems. Furthermore, we analyzed the UV effect on the photosynthetic activity in hours of maximum solar radiation and we tested the impact of UV radiation on male and female reproductive performance. We found that anthocyanin concentrations showed a significant decrease of about 20% with UV-exclusion in petals and stems, and 30% in calyces. Flavone concentrations showed a significant reduction of approximately 25% in calyces and stems, and 12% in leaves. Photochemical efficiency of plants grown under UV stress decreased sharply at maximum light stress, but their ability for recovery after light-stress was not affected. In addition, exposure to UV radiation does not seem to affect ovule production or seed set, but decreases the total seed production per plant and pollen production by 69% and 31%, respectively. Our results demonstrate that UV radiation produced opposite effects on flavonoid accumulation and reproduction in S. littorea. UV stress increased flavonoid concentrations, suggesting a photoprotective role of flavonoids against UV radiation, but had negative consequences for reproduction. We propose that this trade-off helps this species to occupy exposed habitats with high UV radiation.",

    "abstract": "Sphingolipids are abundant and essential molecules in eukaryotes that have crucial functions as signaling molecules and as membrane components. Sphingolipid biosynthesis starts in the endoplasmic reticulum with the condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA. Sphingolipid biosynthesis is highly regulated to maintain sphingolipid homeostasis. Even though, serine is an essential component of the sphingolipid biosynthesis pathway, its role in maintaining sphingolipid homeostasis has not been precisely studied. Here we show that serine uptake is an important factor for the regulation of sphingolipid biosynthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using genetic experiments, we find the broad-specificity amino acid permease Gnp1 to be important for serine uptake. We confirm these results with serine uptake assays in gnp1{Delta} cells. We further show that uptake of exogenous serine by Gnp1 is important to maintain cellular serine levels and observe a specific connection between serine uptake and the first step of sphingolipid biosynthesis. Using mass spectrometry-based flux analysis, we further observed imported serine as the main source for de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis. Our results demonstrate that yeast cells preferentially use the uptake of exogenous serine to regulate sphingolipid biosynthesis. Our study can also be a starting point to analyze the role of serine uptake in mammalian sphingolipid metabolism.\n\nAuthor SummarySphingolipids (SPs) are membrane lipids globally required for eukaryotic life. In contrast to other lipid classes, SPs cannot be stored in the cell and therefore their levels have to be tightly regulated. Failure to maintain sphingolipid homeostasis can result in pathologies including neurodegeneration, childhood asthma and cancer. However, we are only starting to understand how SP biosynthesis is adjusted according to need. In this study, we use genetic and biochemical methods to show that the uptake of exogenous serine is necessary to maintain SP homeostasis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Serine is one of the precursors of long chain bases in cells, the first intermediate of SP metabolism. Our results suggest that the uptake of serine is directly coupled to SP biosynthesis at ER-plasma membrane contact sites. Overall, our study identifies serine uptake as a novel regulatory factor of SP homeostasis. While we use yeast as a discovery tool, these results also provide valuable insights into mammalian SP biology especially under pathological conditions.",

    "abstract": "Qsp1 is a secreted quorum sensing peptide required for virulence of the fungal meningitis pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. Qsp1 functions to control cell wall integrity in vegetatively growing cells and also functions in mating. Rather than acting on a cell surface receptor, Qsp1 is imported to act intracellularly via the predicted oligopeptide transporter Opt1. Here, we identify a transcription factor network as a target of Qsp1. Using whole-genome chromatin immunoprecipitation, we find Qsp1 controls the genomic associations of three transcription factors to genes whose outputs are regulated by Qsp1. One of these transcription factors, Cqs2, is also required for the action of Qsp1 during mating, indicating that it might be a shared proximal target of Qsp1. Consistent with this hypothesis, deletion of CQS2 impacts the binding of other network transcription factors specifically to Qsp1-regulated genes. These genetic and genomic studies illuminate mechanisms by which an imported peptide acts to modulate eukaryotic gene expression.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYFor many fungal pathogens, the ability to adapt to changing and diverse environments forms the basis for their ability to infect and survive inside macrophages and other niches in the human body, and these changes are accomplished by transcription factors. Many pathogenic microbes coordinate their gene expression as a function of cell density in a process known as quorum sensing. Here, in the human fungal meningitis pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, we find that an imported eukaryotic quorum sensing peptide that is important for virulence, Qsp1, controls the binding of three different transcription factors to promoters, thereby modulating the expression of Qsp1-regulated genes. This discovery reveals the mechanism for how an imported peptide affects gene expression.",

    "abstract": "The genus Candida is the most common etiological factor of opportunistic fungal infections in humans. The virulence of Candida species is due to a wide repertoire of factors, specifically, the ability to form biofilms. Medical devices such as intravenous catheters, prosthetic heart valves and surgical interventions provide pathogenic microorganisms with a surface to adhere to form biofilm. The objectives of this study were to investigate the biofilm ultrastructure of Diutina (Candida) rugosa (D. rugosa) at different developmental phases using Confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), quantify {beta}-glucan, total carbohydrate and total protein in the extracellular matrix (ECM) using enzymatic {beta}-glucan kit, phenol-sulfuric acid method and Bradfords method, respectively, and to identify Sessile Minimum Inhibition Concentrations (SMICs) of amphotericin B, caspofungin, fluconazole, and voriconazole using serial doubling dilution. From the SEM micrographs, D. rugosa biofilms were composed of adherent yeast cells and blastospores with hyphal elements. The ultrastructure of the yeast cells was collapsed and disfigured upon exposure to amphotericin B, fluconazole and voriconazole and the biofilms presented with punctured yeast morphology upon exposure to caspofungin at their respective SMICs. The matrix thickness of embedded yeast cells from CLSM micrographs was 3.9{micro}m at 48h. However, there was reduction in the thickness of the biofilms upon antifungal exposure. The antifungal exposed biofilms exhibit bright, diffuse, green-yellow fluorescence that were not seen in the control. D. rugosa biofilm matrices revealed 172.57{micro}g/mL of carbohydrate, and 27.11{micro}g/mL of protein content. The {beta}-glucan yield in D. rugosa complex planktonic cells were in the range of 2.5 to 4.38%, on the contrary, {beta}-glucan was not detected in the ECM. The SMICs of Diutina biofilm for amphotericin B is 1024g/mL, caspofungin is 512 g/mL, whereas fluconazole and voriconazole is 2048 g/mL, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the etiological agent of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), and the neurological disease HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). The HTLV-1 Tax protein persistently activates the NF-{kappa}B pathway to enhance the proliferation and survival of HTLV-1 infected T cells. Lysine 63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitination of Tax provides an important regulatory mechanism that promotes Tax-mediated interaction with the IKK complex and activation of NF-{kappa}B; however, the host proteins regulating Tax ubiquitination are largely unknown. To identify novel Tax interacting proteins that may regulate its ubiquitination we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen using Tax as bait. This screen yielded the E3/E4 ubiquitin conjugation factor UBE4B as a novel binding partner for Tax. Here, we confirmed the interaction between Tax and UBE4B in mammalian cells by co-immunoprecipitation assays and demonstrated colocalization by proximity ligation assay and confocal microscopy. Overexpression of UBE4B specifically enhanced Tax-induced NF-{kappa}B activation, whereas knockdown of UBE4B impaired Tax-induced NF-{kappa}B activation and the induction of NF-{kappa}B target genes in T cells and ATLL cell lines. Furthermore, depletion of UBE4B with shRNA resulted in apoptotic cell death and diminished the proliferation of ATLL cell lines. Finally, overexpression of UBE4B enhanced Tax polyubiquitination, and knockdown or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of UBE4B attenuated both K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitination of Tax. Collectively, these results implicate UBE4B in HTLV-1 Tax polyubiquitination and downstream NF-{kappa}B activation.\n\nAuthor SummaryInfection with the retrovirus HTLV-1 leads to the development of either CD4+CD25+ leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) or a demyelinating neuroinflammatory disease (HAM/TSP) in a subset of infected individuals. The HTLV-1 Tax protein is a regulatory protein which regulates viral gene expression and persistently activates cellular signaling pathways such as NF-{kappa}B to drive the clonal expansion and longevity of HTLV-1 infected CD4+ T cells. Polyubiquitination of Tax is a key mechanism of NF-{kappa}B activation by assembling and activating I{kappa}B kinase (IKK) signaling complexes; however, the host factors regulating Tax ubiquitination have remained elusive. Here, we have identified the E3/E4 ubiquitin conjugation factor UBE4B as a novel Tax binding protein that promotes both K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitination of Tax. Knockdown or knockout of UBE4B impairs Tax-induced NF-{kappa}B activation and triggers apoptosis of HTLV-1 transformed cells. Therefore, UBE4B is an integral host factor that supports HTLV-1 Tax polyubiquitination, NF-{kappa}B activation and cell survival.",

    "abstract": "The stimulation of a single neuron in the rat somatosensory cortex can elicit a behavioral response. The probability of a behavioral response does not depend appreciably on the duration or intensity of a constant stimulation, whereas the response probability increases significantly upon injection of an irregular current. Biological mechanisms that can potentially suppress a constant input signal are present in the dynamics of both neurons and synapses and seem ideal candidates to explain these experimental findings. Here, we study a large network of integrate-and-fire neurons with several salient features of neuronal populations in the rat barrel cortex. The model includes cellular spike-frequency adaptation, experimentally constrained numbers and types of chemical synapses endowed with short-term plasticity, and gap junctions. Numerical simulations of this model indicate that cellular and synaptic adaptation mechanisms alone may not be sufficient to account for the experimental results if the local network activity is read out by an integrator. However, a differentiator circuit can detect the single-cell stimulation with a reliability that barely depends on the length or intensity of the stimulus, but that increases when an irregular signal is used. This finding is in accordance with the experimental results obtained for the stimulation of a regularly-spiking excitatory cell.\n\nAuthor summaryIt is widely assumed that only a large group of neurons can encode a stimulus or control behavior. This tenet of neuroscience has been challenged by experiments in which stimulating a single cortical neuron has had a measurable effect on an animals behavior. Recently, theoretical studies have explored how a single-neuron stimulation could be detected in a large recurrent network. However, these studies missed essential biological mechanisms of cortical networks and are unable to explain more recent experiments in the barrel cortex. Here, to describe the stimulated brain area, we propose and study a network model endowed with many important biological features of the barrel cortex. Importantly, we also investigate different readout mechanisms, i.e. ways in which the stimulation effects can propagate to other brain areas. We show that a readout network which tracks rapid variations in the local network activity is in agreement with the experiments. Our model demonstrates a possible mechanism for how the stimulation of a single neuron translates into a signal at the population level, which is taken as a proxy of the animals response. Our results illustrate the power of spiking neural networks to properly describe the effects of a single neurons activity.",

However, little is known about BIVA in Asian adults, and even less is known about using standing BIVA devices. Standing impedance analyzer allows quicker and more convenient way to gather data than conventional supine analyzer and is more suitable for clinical practice. This study aimed to investigate the relations between muscle function and BIVA parameters measured with a standing impedance analyzer in healthy Taiwanese adults.\n\nMethodsA total of 406 healthy subjects (age 34.5 {+/-} 17.3 years, body mass index 24.1 {+/-} 4.1 kg/m2) were recruited for BIVA and handgrip strength (HGS) measurements. Impedance parameters, including resistance (R) and reactance (Xc), were measured and normalized to body size by dividing by height (H). The resulting phase angle (PhA) was calculated. HGS in the dominant, left, and right hands were referred to as HGSDH, HGSLH, and HGSRH, respectively. All subjects were divided into 5 grades according to HGS.\n\nResultsMuscle strength in the dominant, right, and left arms was correlated with variables in the order of sex, weight, age, height, Xc/H, and R/H (all, p < 0.001). Using all 6 variables, the determination coefficients were 0.792, 0.782, and 0.745, respectively, whereas the standard errors of estimates were 56.89, 58.01, and 56.67 N for HGSDH, HGSLH, and HGSRH, respectively. HGS was positively correlated with PhA, and negatively correlated with Xc/H and R/H.\n\nConclusionsBIVA parameters measured with a standing impedance analyzer and anthropometric variables can predict and discriminate muscle function with good performance in healthy Asian adults.",

Maximum esterase and alpha amylase activity was found in Zygophyllum fabago (14.3{+/-}0.44 and 140{+/-}18.8 mg/g respectively). Flavonoid content was high in T. longipetalus subsp. longipetalus (666.1{+/-}49 g/ml). The highest total phenolic content and tannin was revealed in F. olivieri (72125{+/-}425 and 37050{+/-}1900 M/g. respectively). Highest value of ascorbic acid was depicted in F. bruguieri var. rechingeri (448{+/-}1.5 g/g). Total soluble Proteins and reducing sugars were detected higher in P. harmala (372.3{+/-}54 and 5.9{+/-}0.1 mg/g respectively). Maximum total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was depicted in Z. simplex (16.9{+/-}0.01 M/g). Pigment analysis exhibited the high value of lycopene and total carotenoids in T. terrestris (7.44{+/-}0.2 and 35.5{+/-}0.0 mg/g respectively). Chlorophyll a, b and total chlorophyll content was found maximum in T. longipetalus subsp. pterophorus (549.1{+/-}9.9, 154.3{+/-}10 and 703.4{+/-}20.2 ug/g respectively). All taxa exhibited anti-inflammatory activity as well as anti-diabetic inhibitory potential. Seed extracts of Zygophyllum eurypterum (96%) exhibited highest inhibitory potential, along with twelve other taxa of Zygophyllaceae indicated (96-76%) activity when compared with the standard drug diclofenac sodium (79%). Seeds of T. longipetalus subsp. longipetalus (85%) exhibited the highest anti-diabetic activity; other eleven taxa also exhibited inhibitory activity of -amylase ranging from (85-69%) compared with Metformin (67%) standard drug. Phytochemical screening revealed that selected taxa proved to be the potential source of natural antioxidants and could further be explored for in-vivo studies and utilized in pharmaceutical industries as potent therapeutic agents validating their ethno-pharmacological uses.",
