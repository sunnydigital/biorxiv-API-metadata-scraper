    "abstract": "In (eco-)toxicological hazard characterization, the No Observed Adverse Effect Concentration or Level (NOAEC or NOAEL) approach is used and often required despite of its known limitations. For count data, statistical testing can be challenging, due to several confounding factors, such as zero inflation, low observation numbers, variance heterogeneity, over- or under-dispersion when applying the Poisson model or hierarchical experimental designs. As several tests are available for count data, we selected sixteen tests suitable for overdispersed counts and compared them in a simulation study. We assessed their performance considering data sets containing mixing distribution and over-dispersion with different observation numbers. It shows that there is no uniformly best approach because the assumed data conditions and assumptions are very different. However, the Dunnett-type procedure based on most likely transformation can be recommended, because of its size and power behavior, which is relatively better over most data conditions as compared to the available alternative test methods, and because it allows flexible modeling and effect sizes can be estimated by confidence intervals. Related R-code is provided for real data examples.",

    "abstract": "The flavivirus NS3 protein is a helicase that has pivotal functions during the viral genome replication process, where it unwinds double-stranded RNA and translocates along the nucleic acid polymer in a nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis-dependent mechanism. An increased interest in this enzyme as a potential target for development of antiviral therapeutics was sparked by the 2015 Zika virus epidemic in the Americas. Crystallographic and computational studies of the flavivirus NS3 helicase have identified the RNA-binding loop as an interesting structural element, which may function as an origin for the RNA-enhanced NTPase activity observed for this family of helicases. Microsecond-long unbiased molecular dynamics as well as extensive replica exchange umbrella sampling simulations of the Zika NS3 helicase have been performed to investigate the RNA-dependence of this loops structural conformations. Specifically, the effect of the bound single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) oligomer on the putative \"open\" and \"closed\" conformations of this loop are studied. In the Apo substrate state, the two structures are nearly isoergonic ({Delta}GO[-&gt;]C = -0.22 kcal mol-1), explaining the structural ambiguity observed in Apo NS3h crystal structures. The bound ssRNA is seen to stabilize the \"open\" conformation ({Delta}GO[-&gt;]C = 1.97 kcal mol-1) through direct protein-RNA interactions at the top of the loop. Interestingly, a small ssRNA oligomer bound over 13 [A] away from the loop is seen to affect the free energy surface to favor the \"open\" structure while minimizing barriers between the two states. The mechanism of the transition between \"open\" and \"closed\" states is characterized as are residues of importance for the RNA-binding loop structures. From these results, the loop is hypothesized to be a viable region in the protein for targeted small-molecule inhibition and mutagenesis studies, where stabilization of the \"closed\" RNA-binding loop will negatively impact RNA-binding and the RNA-enhanced NTPase activity.",

    "abstract": "The environment has constantly shaped plant genomes, but the genetic bases underlying how plants adapt to environmental influences remain largely unknown. We constructed a high-density genomic variation map by re-sequencing genomes of 263 geographically representative peach landraces and wild relatives. A combination of whole-genome selection scans and genome-wide environmental association studies (GWEAS) was performed to reveal the genomic bases of peach local adaptation to diverse climates comprehensively. A total of 2,092 selective sweeps that underlie local adaptation to both mild and extreme climates were identified, including 339 sweeps conferring genomic pattern of adaptation to high altitudes. Using GWEAS, a total of 3,496 genomic loci strongly associated with 51 specific environmental variables were detected. The molecular mechanism underlying adaptive evolution of high drought, strong UV-B, cold hardiness, sugar content, flesh color, and bloom date were revealed. Finally, based on 30 years of observation, a candidate gene associated with bloom date advance, representing peach responses to global warming, was identified. Collectively, our study provides insights into molecular bases of how environments have shaped peach genomes by natural selection and adds valuable genome resources and candidate genes for future studies on evolutionary genetics, adaptation to climate changes, and future breeding.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can be used in vivo to quantify neurometabolite concentration and provide evidence for the involvement of different neurotransmitter systems, e.g., inhibitory and excitatory, in sensory and cognitive processes. The relatively low signal-to-noise of MRS measurements has shaped the types of questions that it has been used to address. In particular, temporal resolution is often sacrificed in MRS studies to achieve sufficient signal to produce a reliable estimate of neurometabolite concentration. Here we apply novel analyses with large datasets from human participants (both sexes) to reveal the dynamics of GABA+ and Glx in visual cortex while participants are at rest (with eyes closed) and compare this with changes in posterior cingulate cortex. We find that the dynamic concentration of GABA+ and Glx in visual cortex drifts in opposite directions, that is, GABA+ decreases while Glx increases over time. Further, we find that in visual, but not posterior cingulate cortex, the concentration of GABA+ predicts that of Glx 120 s later, such that a change in GABA+ is correlated with a subsequent opposite change in Glx. Together, these results expose novel temporal trends and interdependencies of primary neurotransmitters in visual cortex. More broadly, we demonstrate the feasibility of using MRS to investigate in vivo dynamic changes of neurometabolites.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTUsing large datasets of magnetic resonance spectroscopy acquisitions from human participants, we develop novel analyses to investigate the temporal dynamics of neurometabolite concentration in visual cortex.

    "abstract": "Visual perception of three-dimensional (3D) structure is important for object recognition, grasping, and manipulation. The 3D structure of a surface can be defined in terms of its slant and tilt. Previous work has shown that slant and tilt are represented in the posterior and ventral intraparietal sulcus of the human brain; however, it is unclear whether the representation of these features is functionally organized within this region. Here we use phase-encoded presentation of 3D planar surfaces with linear gradients defined by horizontal binocular disparity while measuring fMRI activity to test whether the representation of 3D surface tilt is functionally organized within visual cortex. We find functionally defined structures within V3A and V7. Most notably, in one participant we find that the tilt preference is unilaterally organized in a pinwheel-like structure, similar to those observed for orientation preference in V1, which encompasses most of area V3A. These findings indicate that 3D orientation is functionally organized within the human visual cortex, and the evidence suggesting the presence of a large pinwheel-like structure indicates that this type of organization may be applied canonically within the brain at multiple scales.",

Three types of mature hemocytes have been characterized in the lymph gland: plasmatocytes, lamellocytes, and crystal cells, which are analogous to vertebrate myeloid cells. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to comprehensively analyze heterogeneity of developing hemocytes in the lymph gland, and discovered novel hemocyte types, stem-like prohemocytes, and intermediate prohemocytes. Additionally, we identified the emergence of the lamellocyte lineage following active cellular immunity caused by wasp infestation. We unraveled similarities and differences between embryonically derived- and larval lymph gland hemocytes. Finally, the comparison of Drosophila lymph gland hemocytes and human immune cells highlights similarities between prohemocytes and hematopoietic stem cell, and between mature hemocytes and myeloid cells across species.

    "abstract": "Inhibitory interneurons integrate into developing circuits in specific ratios and distributions. In the cortex, the formation of inhibitory networks occurs concurrently with the apoptotic elimination of a third of GABAergic interneurons. The molecular mechanisms that select GABAergic interneurons to survive or die are unknown. Here we report that the clustered Protocadherins regulate GABAergic cell survival in the developing brain. Deletion of the Pcdh-gamma genes (Pcdhgs) from GABAergic neurons in mice causes a severe loss of inhibitory neurons in multiple brain regions and results in motor deficits and seizure activities. By focusing on the neocortex and cerebellar cortex, we demonstrate that GABAergic interneuron loss results from elevated apoptosis during the postnatal wave of Bax-dependent programmed cell death. Pro-survival AKT signals are reduced in Pcdhg-deficient interneurons, diminishing the intrinsic capacity of interneurons to compete and incorporate into developing networks. We propose that the Pcdhgs mediate selective GABAergic interneuron survival to contribute to the formation of balanced inhibitory networks.",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) fertilizers applied to agricultural soils result in the release of nitrogen, mainly nitrate (NO3-) in addition to nitrous oxide (N2O) and ammonia (NH3), into the environment. Nitrogen transformation in soil is a complex process and the soil microbial population can regulate the potential for N mineralization, nitrification and denitrification. Here we show that agricultural soils under standard agricultural N-management are consistently characterized by a high presence of gene copies for some of the key biological activities related to the N-cycle. This led to a strong NO3- reduction (75%) passing from the soil surface (15.38 {+/-} 11.36 g N-NO3 kg-1 on average) to 1 m deep layer (3.92 {+/-} 4.42 g N-NO3 kg-1 on average), and ensured low nitrate presence in the deepest layer. Under these circumstances the other soil properties play a minor role in reducing soil nitrate presence in soil. However, with excessive N fertilization, the abundance of bacterial gene copies is not sufficient to explain N leaching in soil and other factors, i.e. soil texture and rainfall, become more important in controlling these aspects.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma, a grade IV astrocytoma, has a poor survival rate in part due to ineffective treatment options available. These tumours are heterogeneous with areas of low oxygen levels, termed hypoxic regions. Many intra-cellular signalling pathways, including DNA repair, can be altered by hypoxia. Since DNA damage induction and subsequent activation of DNA repair mechanisms is the cornerstone of glioblastoma treatment, alterations to DNA repair mechanisms could have a direct influence on treatment success. Our aim was to elucidate the impact of chronic hypoxia on DNA repair gene expression in a range of glioblastoma cell lines. We adopted a NanoString transcriptomic approach to examine the expression of 180 DNA repair related genes in four classical glioblastoma cell lines (U87-MG, U251-MG, D566-MG, T98G) exposed to 5 days of normoxia (21% O2), moderate (1% O2) or severe (0.1% O2) hypoxia. We observed altered gene expression in several DNA repair pathways including homologous recombination repair, non-homologous end-joining and mismatch repair, with hypoxia primarily resulting in downregulation of gene expression. The extend of gene expression changes was function of the hypoxic severity. Some, but not all, of these downregulations were directly under the control of HIF activity. For example, the downregulation of LIG4, a key component of non-homologous end-joining, was reversed upon inhibition of the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). In contrast, the downregulation of the mismatch repair gene, PMS2, was not affected by HIF inhibition. This suggests that numerous molecular mechanisms lead to hypoxia-induced reprogramming of the transcriptional landscape of DNA repair. Whilst the global impact of hypoxia on DNA repair gene expression is likely to lead to genomic instability, tumorigenesis and reduced sensitivity to anti-cancer treatment, treatment re-sensitizing might require additional approaches to a simple HIF inhibition.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe role of questing ticks in the epidemiology of tick-borne diseases in Kenyas Maasai Mara National Reserve (MMNR), an ecosystem with intensified human-wildlife-livestock interactions, remains poorly understood. Therefore, we carried out a survey of the diversity of questing ticks, their blood-meal hosts, and tick-borne pathogens to understand potential effects to human and livestock health.\n\nMethodsQuesting ticks were collected by flagging and hand picks from vegetation in 25 localities and identified based on morphologic and molecular criteria. We used PCR with high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis, and sequencing to identify Anaplasma, Babesia, Coxiella, Ehrlichia, Rickettsia, and Theileria pathogen diversities and blood meals in 231 tick pools.\n\nResultsA total of 1,465 host-seeking ticks were collected, including Rhipicephalus appendiculatus (n = 1,125), Rhipicephalus pulchellus (n = 6), Rhipicephalus evertsi (n = 5), Amblyomma cf. gemma (n = 178), Amblyomma gemma (n = 145), Amblyomma variegatum (n = 4), Amblyomma sp. (n = 1), and Haemaphysalis leachi (n = 1). Remnant blood-meals from humans, wildebeest, and African buffalo were detected in Rh. appendiculatus, goat in Rh. evertsi, sheep in Am. gemma, and cattle in Am. variegatum. Rickettsia africae was detected in Am. gemma (1/25 pools) that had blood-meal remnant from sheep and Am. variegatum (4/25 pools) that had fed on cattle. Rickettsia spp. were found in Am. gemma (4/25 pools) and Rh. evertsi (1/4 pools). Anaplasma ovis was detected in Rh. appendiculatus (1/172 pools) and Rh. evertsi (1/4 pools), while Anaplasma bovis was detected in Rh. appendiculatus (1/172 pools). Theileria parva was detected in Rh. appendiculatus (27/172 pools). Babesia, Ehrlichia and Coxiella pathogens were not found in any ticks. Unexpectedly, diverse Coxiella sp. endosymbionts were detected in all tick genera (174/231 pools).\n\nConclusionsThe data shows that ticks from the rapidly-changing MMNR are infected with zoonotic R.africae and unclassified Rickettsia spp, demonstrating the persistent risk of African tick-bite fever and other and Spotted Fever Group rickettsioses to local dwellers and visitors to the Maasai Mara ecosystem. Protozoan pathogens that may pose risk to livestock production were also identified. We also highlight possible existence of morphotypic variants of Amblyomma species, based on the observation of Ambyomma cf. gemma, which may be potential human parasites or emergent disease vectors. Our findings also demonstrate that questing ticks in this ecosystem have dynamic vertebrate blood sources including humans, wildlife and domestic animals, which may amplify transmission of tickborne zoonoses and livestock diseases. Further studies are needed to determine the role of Coxiella endosymbionts in tick physiology and vector competence.",

    "abstract": "PhoH2 proteins are highly conserved across bacteria and archaea yet their biological function is poorly characterised. We examined the growth profiles of Mycobacterium smegmatis strains mc2155 and mc2155 {Delta}phoH2 and observed the same growth profile and growth rate in a variety of conditions. In light of the comparable growth rates, we used RNAseq to provide a snapshot of the differences between the transcriptomes of M. smegmatis mc2155 and M. smegmatis mc2155 {Delta}phoH2 during normal growth. At 48 hours, elevated expression of the sigF regulon and its predicted regulatory cascade was observed in{Delta} phoH2 relative to wild type. In biochemical assays, PhoH2 showed specific activity toward sigF mRNA insinuating a role of PhoH2 in modulating the pool of sigF mRNA in the cell during normal growth, adding further complexity to the repertoire of reported mechanisms of post-translational regulation. Multiple copies of the preferred target site of PhoH2 were identified in loops of the sigF mRNA structure, leading us to propose a mechanism for the activity of PhoH2 that is initiated after assembly on specific single-stranded loops of RNA. We hypothesise that PhoH2 is a toxin-antitoxin that contributes to the regulation of SigF at a post-transcriptional level through targeted activity on sigF mRNA. This work presents the first evidence for post-transcriptional regulation of SigF along with the biological function of PhoH2 from M. smegmatis. This also has implications for the highly conserved PhoH2 toxin-antitoxin module across the mycobacteria including the important human pathogen M. tuberculosis.",
