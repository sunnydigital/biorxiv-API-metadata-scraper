    "abstract": "Peripheral vision comprises most of our visual field, and is essential in guiding visual behavior. Its characteristic capabilities and limitations, which distinguish it from foveal vision, have been explained by the most influential theory of peripheral vision as the product of representing the visual input using summary-statistics. Despite its success, this account may provide a limited understanding of peripheral vision, because it neglects processes of perceptual grouping and segmentation. To test this hypothesis, we studied how contextual modulation, namely the modulation of the perception of a stimulus by its surrounds, interacts with segmentation in human peripheral vision. We used naturalistic textures, which are directly related to summary-statistics representations. We show that segmentation cues affect contextual modulation, and that this is not captured by our implementation of the summary-statistics model. We then characterize the effects of different texture statistics on contextual modulation, providing guidance for extending the model, as well as for probing neural mechanisms of peripheral vision.",

    "abstract": "A central debate in the systems neuroscience of memory concerns whether different medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures support different processes or material-types in recognition memory. We tested a rare patient (Patient MH) with a perirhinal lesion that appeared to spare the hippocampus, using two recognition memory paradigms, each run separately with faces, scenes and words. Replicating reports of a previous case, Patient MH showed impaired familiarity and preserved recollection, relative to controls, with no evidence for any effect of material-type. Moreover, when compared with other amnesic patients, who had hippocampal lesions that appeared to spare the perirhinal cortex, Patient MH showed greater impairment on familiarity and less on recollection, forming a double dissociation. However, when replacing this traditional, binary categorization of patients with a parametric analysis that related memory performance to continuous measures of brain damage across all patients, we found a different pattern: while hippocampal damage predicted recollection, it was parahippocampal instead of perirhinal (or entorhinal) cortex volume that predicted familiarity. Furthermore, there was no evidence that these brain-behavior relationships were moderated by material-type, nor by laterality of damage. Thus, while our data provide the most compelling support yet for dual-process models of recognition memory, in which recollection and familiarity depend on different MTL structures, they suggest that familiarity depends more strongly upon the parahippocampal rather than perirhinal cortex. More generally, our study reinforces the need to go beyond single-case and group studies, and instead examine continuous brain-behavior relationships across larger patient groups.",

    "abstract": "Mechanisms relating the gut bacteria to Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) have been proposed containing the dysbiosis-induced dysregulation of hepatic lipid metabolism that allows for the translocation of microbial components and leads to hepatic inflammation and steatosis. Andrographolide (AG) regulates inflammation mediated by NF-{kappa}B pathway which also play a key role in reduction of inflammation and fibrosis in experimental nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), yet the mechanisms linking this effect to gut microbiota remain obscure. Here we show that ApoE knockout (Apoe -/-) mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) supplemented with AG regulates levels of biochemical index and inflammatory cytokines associated with gut microbe. Moreover, HEPG2 cells induced by ox-LDL were used as validation in vitro. H&E staining and Oil-Red staining were respectively used for tissue and cells morphology. Gut microbiota were examined by 16S rRNA sequencing. Expression of NF-{kappa}B, C/EBP{beta} and PPAR-{gamma} in liver and HEPG2 cells were detected by western blot and qRT-PCR. The results showed, among others, that AG alleviate hepatic steatosis and fat content in HEPG2 cells, while it induced decreased levels of Bacteroides, and increased levels of Faecalibaculum, Akkermansia. We further identified that inhibition of NF-{kappa}B/C/EBP{beta}/PPAR-{gamma} pathway of hepatic steatosis model in vivo and vitro by AG also contributes to prevention of HFD-induced inflammation and dislipidemia. Importantly, as result of pearson correlation, Bacteroides may be the most relevant one fundamentally involved in the mechanism of AG attenuates NAFLD. Together, our findings uncover an interaction between AG and gut microbiota as a novel mechanism for the anti-NAFLD effect of AG acting through prevention of microbial dysbiosis, dislipidemia and inflammation.\n\nImportanceHFD due to gut microbial dysbiosis is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of dislipidemia and inflammation, which primarily mediates the development of NAFLD. A treatment strategy to reduce both dislipidemia and inflammation appears to be an effective approach for addressing the issue of NAFLD. Andrographolide (AG) is the major effect component in traditional Chinese medicine Chuan-xin-lian (Andrographis). Little is known about the role of gut microbiota in the anti-NAFLD effect of AG. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that AG significantly decreased Bacteroides and increased Faecalibaculum, Akkermansia. By using vivo and vitro experiment, we prove that gut microbiota plays a key role in AG-induced protective against high-fat-diet-induced dislipidemia and inflammation. Moreover, NF-{kappa}B/C/EBP{beta}/PPAR-{gamma} pathway inhibition was partially involved in the beneficial effect of AG. Together, these data suggest that the gut microbiome is a critical factor for the anti-NAFLD effects of AG.",

    "abstract": "Rice (Oryza sativa L.) ssp. indica is the most cultivated species in the South of Brazil. However, these plants face low temperature stress from September to November, which is the period of early sowing, affecting plant development during the initial stages of growth, and reducing rice productivity. This study aimed to characterize the root response to low temperature stress during the early vegetative stage of two rice genotypes contrasting in their cold tolerance (CT, cold-tolerant; and CS, cold-sensitive). Root dry weight and length, as well as number of root hairs, were higher in CT than CS when exposed to cold treatment. Histochemical analyses indicated that roots of CS genotype present higher levels of lipid peroxidation and H2O2 accumulation, along with lower levels of plasma membrane integrity than CT under low temperature stress. RNAseq analyses revealed that the contrasting genotypes present completely different molecular responses to cold stress. The number of over-represented functional categories was lower in CT than CS under cold condition, suggesting that CS genotype is more impacted by low temperature stress than CT. Several genes might contribute to rice cold tolerance, including the ones related with cell wall remodeling, cytoskeleton and growth, signaling, antioxidant system, lipid metabolism, and stress response. On the other hand, high expression of the genes SRC2 (defense), root architecture associated 1 (growth), ACC oxidase, ethylene-responsive transcription factor, and cytokinin-O-glucosyltransferase 2 (hormone-related) seems to be related with cold sensibility. Since these two genotypes have a similar genetic background (sister lines), the differentially expressed genes found here can be considered candidate genes for cold tolerance and could be used in future biotechnological approaches aiming to increase rice tolerance to low temperature.",

This limits our understanding of the role of behaviour in trophic relationships and our ability to predict predators and prey distributions. Here we combined a simulation model with a genetic algorithm to discover how predators and prey behaving optimally should use information in environments with different levels of heterogeneity in prey forage distribution and prey vulnerability. Our results demonstrate the key role of movement unpredictability in successful strategies for both predators and prey, supporting the  shell-game hypothesis. We however reveal striking differences between predators and prey in the magnitude of this unpredictability, and in how it varies with the environment. Our work offers a robust theoretical framework to better understand predator-prey space use and interpret empirical studies.",

Furthermore, individual cells inside the droplet can be released from the traps or merged with other droplets by simply applying an electric potential to the electrodes that is actuated through a user interface.

However, pathogen presence naturally varies over time in nature, such as in the case of seasonal epidemics. We experimentally coevolved populations of Caenorhabditis elegans worm hosts with bacteria possessing protective traits (Enterococcus faecalis), in treatments varying the infection frequency with pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus every host generation, alternating host generations, every fifth host generation or never. We additionally investigated the effect of initial pathogen presence at the formation of the defensive symbiosis. Our results show that enhanced microbe-mediated protection evolved during host-protective microbe coevolution when faced with rare infections by a pathogen. Initial pathogen presence had no effect on the evolutionary outcome of microbe-mediated protection. We also found that protection was only effective at preventing mortality during the time of pathogen infection. Overall, our results suggest that resident microbes can be a form of transgenerational immunity against rare pathogen infection.",

    "abstract": "Adult female mosquitoes require a vertebrate blood meal to develop eggs and continue their life cycle. During blood feeding, mosquito saliva is injected at the bite site to facilitate blood meal acquisition through anti-hemostatic compounds that counteract blood clotting, platelet aggregation, vasoconstriction and host immune responses. D7 proteins are among the most abundant components of the salivary glands of several blood feeding insects. They are members of a family of proteins that have evolved through gene duplication events to encode D7 proteins of several lengths. Here, we examine the ligand binding specificity and physiological relevance of two D7 long proteins, CxD7L1 and CxD7L2, from Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes, the vector of medical and veterinary diseases such as filariasis, avian malaria, and West Nile virus infections. CxD7L1 and CxD7L2 were assayed by microcalorimetry for binding of potential host ligands involved in hemostasis, including bioactive lipids, biogenic amines, and nucleotides/nucleosides. CxD7L2 binds serotonin, histamine, and epinephrine with high affinity as well as the thromboxane A2 analog U-46619 and several cysteinyl leukotrienes, as previously described for other D7 proteins. CxD7L1 does not bind any of the ligands that are bound by CxD7L2. Unexpectedly, CxD7L1 exhibited high affinity for adenine nucleotides and nucleosides, a binding capacity not reported in any D7 family member. We solved the crystal structure of CxD7L1 in complex with bound ADP to 1.97 [A] resolution. The binding pocket for ADP is located between the two domains of CxD7L1, whereas all known D7s bind ligands either within the N-terminal or the C-terminal domains. We demonstrated that these two CxD7 long proteins inhibit human platelet aggregation in ex vivo experiments. CxD7L1 and CxD7L2 help blood feeding in mosquitoes by scavenging host molecules that promote vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation, itch, and pain at the bite site. The novel ADP-binding function acquired by CxD7L1 evolved to enhance blood feeding in mammals where ADP plays a key role in platelet aggregation.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTOn the basis of distinct lines of evidence, detailed reconstructions of the Holocene population history of the Sabana de Bogota (SB) region, Northern South America, have been performed. Currently, there exist two competing models that support temporal continuity or, alternatively, divergence. Despite recent research that lends support to the population discontinuity model, several discrepancies remain, calling for other kinds of evidences to be explored for a more detailed picture of Holocene biocultural evolution. In this study, we analyze the mitochondrial genetic diversity of 30 individuals (including 15 newly reported complete mitochondrial genomes) recovered from several archaeological sites spanning from the late Pleistocene (12,164 cal BP) until the final late Holocene (2,751 cal BP) along with published data from the region dating [~]9,000-550 cal BP in order to investigate diachronic genetic change. Genetic diversity and distance indices were calculated, and demographic models tested in an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) framework to evaluate whether patterns of genetic affinities of the SB prehispanic populations support genetic continuity or discontinuity. The results show that mitochondrial genomes of the complete dataset fall within the Native American haplogroups A2, B2, C1b, D1 and D4h3a. Haplotype and nucleotide diversity declined over time with further evidence of genetic drift and remarkable reduction of genetic diversity during the final late Holocene. Inter-population distances and the exact test of population differentiation, as well as demographic simulations show no population differentiation and population continuity over time. Consequently, based on the analyzed data, we cannot reject the genetic continuity in the SB region as a plausible population history scenario. However, the restriction of the analyses to the Hyper Variable Region 1 of the mitochondrial genome, and the very low sample size both constitute significant limitations to infer evolutionary history.",

Most previous investigations of the association between childhood socioeconomic status and brain morphology have used cross-sectional designs with samples that span wide age ranges, occluding effects specific to adolescence. Sex differences in the association between childhood socioeconomic status and neurodevelopment may emerge or intensify during adolescence. We used tensor-based morphometry, a whole brain approach, to examine sex differences in the cross-sectional association between normative variation in family income-to-needs ratio (INR) and cortical and subcortical gray and white matter volume during early adolescence (ages 9-13 years, N=147), as well as in the longitudinal association between in INR and change in volume from early to later adolescence (ages 11-16 years, N=109). Biological sex interacted with INR to explain variation in volume in several areas cross-sectionally and longitudinally.

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic climate change threatens corals globally and both high and low temperatures are known to induce coral bleaching. However, coral stress responses across wide thermal breadths are rarely explored. In addition, it is difficult to disentangle the role of symbiosis on the stress response of obligately symbiotic coral hosts. Here, we leverage aposymbiotic colonies of the facultatively symbiotic coral, Astrangia poculata, which lives naturally with and without its algal symbiont, to examine how broad thermal challenges influence coral hosts. A. poculata were collected from their northern range limit and thermally challenged in two independent 16-day common garden experiments (heat and cold challenge) and behavioral responses to food stimuli and genome-wide gene expression profiling (TagSeq) were performed. Both thermal challenges elicited significant reductions in polyp extension. However, five times as many genes were differentially expressed under cold challenge compared to heat challenge. Despite more genes responding to cold challenge, there was significant overlap in which genes were differentially expressed across thermal challenges. These convergently responding genes (CRGs) were associated with downregulation of motor functions and nematocysts while others were consistent with stress responses previously identified in tropical corals. The fact that these responses were observed in aposymbiotic colonies highlights that many genes previously implicated in stress responses in symbiotic species may simply represent the corals stress response in or out of symbiosis.",

    "abstract": "1.Diatoms are a diverse group of mainly photosynthetic algae, responsible for 20% of worldwide oxygen production, which can rapidly respond to favourable conditions and often outcompete other phytoplankton. We investigated the contribution of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) to its ecological success. A systematic phylogeny-based bacterial HGT detection procedure across nine sequenced diatoms showed that 3-5% of their proteome has a horizontal origin and a large influx occurred at the ancestor of diatoms. More than 90% of HGT genes are expressed, and species-specific HGT genes in Phaeodactylum tricornutum undergo strong purifying selection. They are implicated in several processes including environmental sensing, and expand the metabolic toolbox. Cobalamin (vitamin B12) is an essential cofactor for roughly half of the diatoms and is only produced by bacteria. Genes involved in its final synthesis were detected as HGT, including five consecutive enzymes in Fragilariopsis cylindrus. This might give diatoms originating from the Southern Ocean, a region typically depleted in cobalamin, a competitive advantage. Overall, we show that HGT is a prevalent mechanism that is actively used in diatoms to expand its adaptive capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Although time perception is based on the internal representation of time, whether the subjective timeline is scaled linearly or logarithmically remains an open issue. Evidence from previous research is mixed: while the classical internal-clock model assumes a linear scale with scalar variability, there is evidence that logarithmic timing provides a better fit to behavioral data. A major challenge for investigating the nature of the internal scale is that the retrieval process required for time judgments may involve a remapping of the subjective time back to the objective scale, complicating any direct interpretation of behavioral findings. Here, we used a novel approach, requiring rapid intuitive  ensemble averaging of a whole set of time intervals, to probe the subjective timeline. Specifically, observers task was to average a series of successively presented, auditory or visual, intervals in the time range 300-1300 ms. Importantly, the intervals were taken from three sets of durations, which were distributed such that the arithmetic mean (from the linear scale) and the geometric mean (from the logarithmic scale) were clearly distinguishable. Consistently across the three sets and the two presentation modalities, our results revealed subjective averaging to be close to the geometric mean, indicative of a logarithmic timeline underlying time perception.",

    "abstract": "Calsyntenin-3 (Clstn3) is a postsynaptic adhesion molecule that induces presynaptic differentiation via presynaptic neurexins (Nrxns), but whether Nrxns directly bind to Clstn3 has been a matter of debate. Here, we show that {beta}-Nrxns directly interact via their LNS domain with Clstn3 and Clstn3 cadherin domains. Expression of splice site 4 (SS4) insert-positive {beta}-Nrxn variants, but not insert-negative variants, reversed the impaired Clstn3 synaptogenic activity observed in Nrxn-deficient neurons. Consistently, Clstn3 selectively formed complexes with SS4-positive Nrxns in vivo. Neuron-specific Clstn3 deletion caused significant reductions in number of excitatory synaptic inputs, and moderate impairment of light-induced anxiety-like behaviors in mice. Moreover, expression of Clstn3 cadherin domains in CA1 neurons of Clstn3 conditional knockout mice rescued structural deficits in excitatory synapses, especially within the stratum radiatum layer. Collectively, our results suggest that Clstn3 links to SS4-positive Nrxns to induce presynaptic differentiation and orchestrate excitatory synapse development in specific hippocampal neural circuits.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the major causes of cancer deaths across the world. Patients survival time at time of diagnosis depends largely on stage of the tumor. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms promoting cancer progression from early stages to high-grade stages is essential for implementing therapeutic approaches. To this end, we performed a unique meta-analysis flowchart by identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between normal, primary and metastatic samples in some test datasets. DEGs were employed to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Then, a smaller network containing 39 DEGs were extracted from the PPI network whose nodes expression induction or suppression alone or in combination with each other would inhibit tumor progression or metastasis. A number of these DEGs were then verified by gene expression profiling, survival analysis and a number of validation datasets from different genomic repositories. They were involved in cell proliferation, energy production under hypoxic conditions, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis. Multiple combination targeting of these DEGs were proposed to have high potential in preventing cancer progression. Some genes were also presented as diagnostic biomarkers for colorectal cancer. Finally, TMEM131, DARS and SORD genes were identified in this study which had never been associated with any kind of cancer neither as a biomarker nor curative target.",
