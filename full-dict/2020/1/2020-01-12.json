    "abstract": "ObjectivesPre-historic decline in human craniofacial masculinity has been proposed as evidence of selection for elevated sociability and a process of  human self-domestication thought to have promoted complex capacities including language, culture, and cumulative technological development. This follows experimental observation of similar changes in non-human animals under selection for reduced aggression. Two distinct domestication hypotheses posit developmental explanations, involving hypoplasia of embryonic neural crest cells (NCCs), and declining androgen influence, respectively. Here, I assess the operation and potential interactions between these two mechanisms and consider their role in enhanced human adaptation to a cooperative sociocultural niche.\n\nMethodsI provide a review and synthesis of related literature with a focus on physiological mechanisms effecting domesticated reductions in masculinity and sexual dimorphism. Further, I examine pre-historic modes of socio-sexual selection likely to drive human self-domestication via reduced aggression and masculinity.\n\nResultsI find pluripotent NCCs provide progenitors for a wide range of vertebrate masculine features, acting as regular targets for sexually driven evolutionary change; suggesting domesticated hypoplasia of NCC-derived tissues would be sufficient to explain declines in masculine traits and features. However, lineage specific androgen receptor variability likely moderates these NCC-based effects.\n\nConclusionsThese findings extend theorised mechanisms driving noted physiological, morphological, and behavioural changes thought to indicate enhanced sociability and human and self-domestication. Multiple current explanations for human sociability are consistent with physiological domestication under socio-sexual selection favouring dampened masculine physiology and behaviour as adaptations to an enhanced sociocultural niche. The analysis highlights multiple avenues for further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophage lambda makes a decision between lysis and lysogeny based on the number of coinfecting phages, namely the multiplicity of infection (MoI): lysis at low MoIs; lysogeny at high MoIs. Here, by evaluating various rationally designed models on their ability a) to make the lytic decision at MoI of 1 and the lysogeny decision at MoI of 2, b) to exhibit bistability at both MoIs, and c) to perform accurately in the presence of noise, it is demonstrated that lambdas lysis/lysogeny decision is based on three features, namely a) mutual repression, b) cooperative positive autoregulation of CI, and c) cooperative binding of the activator protein, not basal expression, triggering positive autoregulatory loop of CI. Cro and CI are sufficient to acquire the first two features. CII is required to acquire the third feature. The quasi-minimal two-protein model for the switch is justified by showing its qualitative equivalence, except for Cro repression of pRM, to the lambdas gene regulatory network responsible for the decision. A three-protein simplified version of the lambdas switch is shown to possess all the three design features. Bistability at MoI of 1 is responsible for lysogen stability, whereas bistability at MoI of 2 imparts stability to lytic development post-infection and especially during prophage induction.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe etiology of depression remains poorly understood. Changes in blood lipid levels were reported to be associated with depression and suicide, however study findings were mixed.\n\nMethodsWe performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the causal relationship between blood lipids and depression phenotypes, based on large-scale GWAS summary statistics (N=188,577/480,359 for lipid/depression traits respectively). Five depression-related phenotypes were included, namely major depressive disorder (MDD; from PGC), depressive symptoms (DS; from SSGAC), longest duration and number of episodes of low mood, and history of deliberate self-harm (DSH)/suicide (from UK Biobank). MR was conducted with inverse-variance weighted (MR-IVW), Egger and Generalized Summary-data-based MR(GSMR) methods.\n\nResultsThere was consistent evidence that triglyceride (TG) is causally associated with DS (MR-IVW beta for one-SD increase in TG=0.0346, 95% CI=0.0114-0.0578), supported by MR-IVW and GSMR and multiple r2 clumping thresholds. We also observed relatively consistent associations of TG with DSH/suicide (MR-Egger OR= 2.514, CI: 1.579-4.003). There was moderate evidence for positive associations of TG with MDD and the number of episodes of low mood. For HDL-c, we observed moderate evidence for causal associations with DS and MDD. LDL-c and TC did not show robust causal relationships with depression phenotypes, except for weak evidence that LDL-c is inversely related to DSH/suicide. We did not detect significant associations when depression phenotypes were treated as exposures.\n\nConclusionsThis study provides evidence to a causal relationship between TG, and to a lesser extent, altered cholesterol levels with depression phenotypes. Further studies on its mechanistic basis and the effects of lipid-lowering therapies are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional profiling has revealed a diverse range of cancer cell states, however an understanding of their function has remained elusive. Using a combination of zebrafish melanoma modeling and human validation, we have identified a conserved stress-like state that confers intrinsic drug resistance. The stress-like state expresses genes such as fos, hsp70 and ubb, all required for adaptation to diverse cellular stresses, and we confirmed its existence using immunofluorescence and spatial transcriptomics. We provide evidence that this state has a higher tumor seeding capabilities compared to non-stressed cells, and confers intrinsic resistance to MEK inhibitors, a commonly used melanoma therapeutic. Furthermore, the stress-like program can be induced by extrinsic processes such as heat shock, and confers resistance to both MEK and BRAF inhibitors in both zebrafish and human melanomas. Collectively, our study suggests that the transcriptional states associated with therapeutic failure are established during the earliest steps of tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities underpin earths biological and geochemical processes, but their complexity hampers understanding. Motivated by the challenge of diversity and the need to forge ways of capturing dynamical behaviour connecting genes to function, biologically independent experimental communities comprising hundreds of microbial genera were established from garden compost and propagated on nitrogen-limited minimal medium with cellulose (paper) as sole carbon source. After one year of bi-weekly transfer, communities retained hundreds of genera. To connect genes to function we used a simple experimental manipulation that involved periodic collection of selfish genetic elements (SGEs) from separate communities, followed by pooling and redistribution across communities. The treatment was predicted to promote amplification and dissemination of SGEs and thus horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Confirmation came from comparative metagenomics, which showed substantive movement of ecologically significant genes whose dynamic across space and time could be followed. Enrichment of genes implicated in nitrogen metabolism, and particularly ammonification, prompted biochemical assays that revealed a measurable impact on community function. Our simple experimental strategy offers a conceptually new approach for unravelling dynamical processes affecting microbial community function.",

    "abstract": "ABSRACTTracking the localization and mobility of individual proteins in live cells is key for understanding how they mediate their function. Such information can be obtained from single molecule imaging techniques such as Single Particle Tracking (SPT) and Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM). Genetic code expansion (GCE) combined with bioorthogonal chemistry offers an elegant approach for direct labeling of proteins with fluorescent dyes, holding great potential for improving protein labeling in single molecule applications. Here we calibrated conditions for performing SPT and live-SMLM of bioorthogonally labeled plasma membrane proteins in live mammalian cells. Using SPT, the diffusion of bioorthogonally labeled EGF receptor and the prototypical Shaker voltage-activated potassium channel (Kv) was measured and characterized. Applying live-SMLM to bioorthogonally labeled Shaker Kv channels enabled visualizing the plasma membrane distribution of the channel over time with ~30 nm accuracy. Finally, by competitive labeling with two Fl-dyes, SPT and live-SMLM were performed in a single cell and both the density and dynamics of the EGF receptor were measured at single molecule resolution in subregions of the cell. We conclude that GCE and bioorthogonal chemistry is a highly suitable, flexible approach for protein labeling in quantitative single molecule applications that outperforms current protein live-cell labeling approaches.",

Systematic integrative analysis can help meet this need, and the VISION project was established for ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of epigenomic data in hematopoiesis. Here, we systematically integrated extensive data recording epigenetic features and transcriptomes from many sources, including individual laboratories and consortia, to produce a comprehensive view of the regulatory landscape of differentiating hematopoietic cell types in mouse. By employing IDEAS as our Integrative and Discriminative Epigenome Annotation System, we identified and assigned epigenetic states simultaneously along chromosomes and across cell types, precisely and comprehensively. Combining nuclease accessibility and epigenetic states produced a set of over 200,000 candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) that efficiently capture enhancers and promoters. The transitions in epigenetic states of these cCREs across cell types provided insights into mechanisms of regulation, including decreases in numbers of active cCREs during differentiation of most lineages, transitions from poised to active or inactive states, and shifts in nuclease accessibility of CTCF-bound elements. Regression modeling of epigenetic states at cCREs and gene expression produced a versatile resource to improve selection of cCREs potentially regulating target genes. These resources are available from our VISION website (usevision.org) to aid research in genomics and hematopoiesis.",

    "abstract": "Rapid changes in species composition, also known as ecotones, can result from various causes including rapid changes in environmental conditions, or physiological thresholds. The possibility that ecotones arise from ecological niche construction by ecosystem engineers has received little attention. In this study, we investigate how the diversity of ecosystem engineers, and their interactions, can give rise to ecotones. We build a spatially explicit dynamical model that couples a multispecies community and its abiotic environment. We use numerical simulations and analytical techniques to determine the biotic and abiotic conditions under which ecotone emergence is expected to occur, and the role of biodiversity therein. We show that the diversity of ecosystem engineers can lead to indirect interactions through the modification of their shared environment. These interactions, which can be either competitive or mutualistic, can lead to the emergence of discrete communities in space, separated by sharp ecotones where a high species turnover is observed. Considering biodiversity is thus critical when studying the influence of species-environment interactions on the emergence of ecotones. This is especially true for the wide range of species that have small to moderate effects on their environment. Our work highlights new mechanisms by which biodiversity loss could cause significant changes in spatial community patterns in changing environments.",

A related, but much less studied question is whether people also have control over the total amount of VWM resource allocated to a task. Here, we approach this question by testing whether increasing monetary incentives results in better overall VWM performance. In three experiments, subjects performed a delayed-estimation task on the Amazon Turk platform. In the first two experiments, four groups of subjects received a bonus payment based on their performance, with the maximum bonus ranging from $0 to $10 between groups. We found no effect of the amount of bonus on intrinsic motivation or on VWM performance in either experiment. In the third experiment, reward was manipulated on a trial-by-trial basis using a within-subjects design. Again, no evidence was found that VWM performance depended on the magnitude of potential reward. These results suggest that encoding quality in visual working memory is insensitive to monetary reward, which has implications for resource-rational theories of VWM.",

In serial transfer culture, populations of mucoid E. coli MG1655 that are resistant to lytic phages with different receptors, and thereby requiring independent mutations for surface resistance, are capable of maintaining these phages with little effect on their total density. Based on the results of our analysis of a mathematical model, we postulate that the maintenance of phage in populations dominated by mucoid cells can be attributed primarily to high rates of transition from the resistant mucoid states to susceptible non-mucoid states. Our tests with both population dynamic and single cell experiments as well as DNA sequence analysis are consistent with this hypothesis. We discuss reasons for the generalized resistance of these mucoid E. coli, and the genetic and molecular mechanisms responsible for the high rate of transition from mucoid to sensitive states responsible for the maintenance of lytic phage in mucoid populations of E. coli.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveSudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of mortality in patients in patients with intractable epilepsy. However, the pathogenesis of SUDEP seems to be poorly understood. Our previous findings showed that the incidence of seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) was markedly reduced by atomoxetine in a murine SUDEP model. Because the central NE -1 receptor (NE-1R) plays a vital role in regulating respiratory function, we hypothesized that the suppression of S-IRA by atomoxetine was mediated by NE/NE-1R interactions that can be reversed by NE-1R antagonism.\n\nMethodsWe examined whether atomoxetine-mediated suppression of S-IRA evoked by either acoustic stimulation or pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) in DBA/1 mice can be reversed by intraperitoneal (IP) and intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of prazosin, a selective antagonist of NE-1R. The content and activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a rate-limiting enzyme for NE synthesis, in the lower brainstem was measured by ELISA. Electroencephalograms (EEG) were obtained by using the PTZ-evoked SUDEP model.\n\nResultsAtomoxetine-mediated suppression of S-IRA evoked by either acoustic stimulation or PTZ was significantly reversed by low doses of IP and ICV prazosin. Neither repetitive acoustic stimulation nor S-IRA reduced TH levels in lower brainstem. However, the enzyme activity of TH levels in lower brainstem was significantly increased by mechanical ventilation with DBA/1 mice ,which makes dead DBA/1 mice suffered from S-IRA and SUDEP recover. EEG data showed that although the protective effect of atomoxetine was reversed by prazosin, neither drug affected EEG activity.\n\nSignificanceThese data suggest that deficient synthesis of NE and norepinephrinergic neurotransmission contributes to S-IRA and that the NE-1R is a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of SUDEP.",

    "abstract": "While one dimensional 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1D 1H-NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most important and convenient method for measuring conformation change in biomacromolecules, characterization of protein dynamics in large membrane protein complexes by 1D 1H-NMR remains challenging, due to the difficulty of spectra assignment, low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and the need for large amount of protein. Here we report the site-specific incorporation of 4-trimethylsilyl phenylalanine (TMSiPhe) into proteins, through genetic code expansion in Escherichia coli cells, and the measurement of multiple conformational states in membrane protein complex by 1D 1H-NMR. The unique up-field 1H-NMR chemical shift of TMSiPhe, highly efficient and specific incorporation of TMSiPhe enabled facile assignment of the TMSiPhe 1H-NMR signal, and characterization of multiple conformational state in a 150 kilodalton (kD) membrane protein complex, using only 5 M of protein and 20 min spectra accumulation time. This highly efficient and convenient methods should be broadly applicable for the investigation of dynamic conformation change of protein complexes.",

    "abstract": "Categorical neural responses underlie various forms of selection and decision-making. Such binary-like responses promote robust signaling of the winner in the presence of input ambiguity and neural noise. Here, we show that a  donut-like inhibitory mechanism in which each competing option suppresses all options except itself, is highly effective at generating categorical neural responses. It surpasses motifs of feedback inhibition, recurrent excitation, and divisive normalization invoked frequently in decision-making models. We demonstrate experimentally not only that this mechanism operates in the midbrain spatial selection network in barn owls, but also that it is necessary for categorical signaling by it. The functional pattern of neural inhibition in the midbrain forms an exquisitely structured  multi-holed donut consistent with this networks combinatorial inhibitory function for stimulus selection. Additionally, modeling reveals a generalizable neural implementation of the donut-like motif for categorical selection. Self-sparing inhibition may, therefore, be a powerful circuit module central to categorization.",

    "abstract": "There has been a growing interest in the autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR). The ASMR is characterized by a tingling sensation around the scalp and neck and often induces a feeling of relaxation and a reduction of a negative mood. However, it is still unknown what factors affect the ASMR. The present study focused on stimulus characteristics and individuals mood states and personality traits. Participants filled out self-reported questionnaires (the Profile of Mood States, Beck Depression Inventory, and Big Five Inventory) and reported ASMR estimates throughout a 17-min experiment while listening to binaural tapping and brushing sounds. Cross-correlation results showed that the ASMR estimates were strongly associated with the acoustic features of auditory stimuli, such as their amplitude, spectral centroid, and spectral bandwidth. This indicates that low-pitched sounds with dark timbre trigger the ASMR. The maximum ASMR was observed around 2 s after the acoustic features changed, suggesting that the sluggishness of multisensory integration may lead to the ASMR experience. In addition, individual differences in the ASMR experience were closely linked to participants mood states, such as anxiety, but not to their personality traits. Our results provide important clues to understand the mechanisms of auditory-somatosensory interactions.\n\nSignificant StatementsThe autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) is characterized by a tingling, electrostatic-like sensation across the scalp and back of the neck. This phenomenon can be triggered by a variety of audiovisual stimuli, and many people seek out the ASMR via the internet to receive a feeling of relaxation and reduce a negative mood. We show that the ASMR is induced about 2 s after acoustic features, such as the amplitude, spectral centroid, and spectral bandwidth are changed. This suggests that low-pitched sounds with dark timbre lead to the ASMR experience. The stimulus-driven ASMR effect is found regardless of the personality traits or mood states of participants. Our findings provide a critical clue to understand the mechanisms of auditory-somatosensory interactions.",

    "abstract": "How cells regulate the size of intracellular structures and organelles, despite continuous turnover in their component parts, is a longstanding question. Recent experiments suggest that size control of many intracellular assemblies is achieved through the depletion of a limiting subunit pool in the cytoplasm. While the limiting pool model ensures organelle size scaling with cell size, it does not provide a mechanism for robust size control of multiple co-existing structures. Here we propose a kinetic theory for size regulation of multiple structures that are assembled from a shared pool of subunits. We demonstrate that a negative feedback between the growth rate and the size of individual structures underlies size regulation of a wide variety of intracellular assemblies, from cytoskeletal filaments to three-dimensional organelles such as centrosomes and the nucleus. We identify the feedback motifs for size control in these structures, based on known molecular interactions, and quantitatively compare our theory with available experimental data. Furthermore, we show that a positive feedback between structure size and growth rate can lead to bistable size distributions arising from autocatalytic growth. In the limit of high subunit concentration, autocatalytic growth of multiple structures leads to stochastic selection of a single structure, elucidating a mechanism for polarity establishment.",

    "abstract": "The interaction of metallic nanoparticles with light excites a local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). This phenomenon enables the transfer of hot electrons to substrates that release Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). In this context, the present study was aimed at enhancing the antibacterial effect of citrate-covered silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), which already possess excellent antimicrobial properties, via LSPR excitation with visible LED against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one of the most refractory organisms to antibiotic treatment. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of AgNPs was 10 g/ml under dark conditions and 5 g/ml under light conditions. The combination of light and AgNPs led to 100% cell death after 60 minutes. Quantification of ROS via flow cytometry showed that LSPR stimulated AgNPs increased intracellular ROS concentration by 4.8-fold, suggesting that light-exposed AgNPs caused cell death via ROS production. Light exposition caused a small release of silver ions (0.4%) reaching a maximum after 6 hours. This indicates that silver ions play at most a secondary role in P. aeruginosa death. Overall, the results presented here show that LSPR generation from AgNPs by visible light enhances the antimicrobial activity of silver nanoparticles and can be an alternative for the treatment of topic infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as P. aeruginosa.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological studies have evidenced a link between type 1 diabetes (T1D) and infections by enteroviruses, especially with coxsackievirus B4 (CV-B4). CV-B4 is able to infect human and murine thymic epithelial cells (TECs) and, in a murine TEC line, we have shown that the diabetogenic strain CV-B4 E2 decreases transcription of insulin-like growth factor 2 gene (Igf2), coding for the self-peptide of the insulin family. Here we show that in CV-B4 infection of mice alters Igf2 transcripts isoforms in TECs, followed by a decrease of pro-IGF2 precursor in the thymus. CV-B4 infection of a murine TEC line decreases Igf2 P3 promoter activity by targeting the region -68 to -22 upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) whereas Igf2 transcripts stability is not affected, pointing towards a regulation of Igf2 transcription. Our data also show that CV-B4 decreases IL-6/STAT3 signaling in vitro. This study provides new knowledge about the regulation of intrathymic Igf2 transcription by CV-B4 and reinforces the hypothesis that CV-B4 infection of the thymus could break central self-tolerance of the insulin family by decreasing Igf2 transcription and IGF2 presentation in thymus epithelium.\n\nIMPORTANCECoxsackievirus B4 represents one of the most important environmental factors associated to type 1 diabetes, autoimmune disease for which no curative treatment exist. The diabetogenic strain Coxsackievirus B4 E2 was previously shown to decrease Igf2 expression, important player for central tolerance towards insulin, in a thymic epithelial cell line. The understanding of Igf2 regulation mechanisms during coxsackievirus B4 infection represents an interest for the understanding of central tolerance development but also for Igf2 transcriptional regulation itself, still poorly understood.\n\nHere we demonstrate that, some transcripts isoforms of Igf2 are also decreased in thymic epithelial cells in vivo. Moreover, we show that this decrease is induced by an alteration of specific regions of Igf2 P3 promoter and may be linked by a decrease of STAT3 signaling. In fine we hope that this work could lead to future therapies leading to reprogramming central tolerance towards {beta} cells antigens via Igf2 expression.",

    "abstract": "Liquid-liquid phase separation of multivalent intrinsically disordered protein-RNA complexes is ubiquitous in both natural and biomimetic systems. So far, isotropic liquid droplets are the most commonly observed topology of RNA-protein condensates in experiments and simulations. Here, by systematically studying the phase behavior of RNA-protein complexes across varied mixture compositions, we report a hollow vesicle-like condensate phase of nucleoprotein assemblies that is distinct from RNA-protein droplets. We show that these vesicular condensates are stable at specific mixture compositions and concentration regimes within the phase diagram and are formed through the phase separation of anisotropic protein-RNA complexes. Similar to membranes composed of amphiphilic lipids, these nucleoprotein-RNA vesicular membranes exhibit local ordering, size-dependent permeability, and selective encapsulation capacity without sacrificing their dynamic formation and dissolution in response to physicochemical stimuli. Our findings suggest that protein-RNA complexes can robustly create lipid-free vesicle-like enclosures by phase separation.\n\nSignificance statementVesicular assemblies play crucial roles in subcellular organization as well as in biotechnological applications. Classically, the ability to form such assemblies were primarily assigned to lipids and lipid-like amphiphilic molecules. Here, we show that disordered RNA-protein complexes can form vesicle-like ordered assemblies at disproportionate mixture compositions. We also show that the ability to form vesicular assemblies is generic to multi-component systems where phase separation is driven by heterotypic interactions. We speculate that such vesicular assemblies play crucial roles in the formation of dynamic multi-layered subcellular membrane-less organelles and can be utilized to fabricate novel stimuli-responsive microscale systems.",

However, despite their widespread use, they lack a universal scalable representation suitable for different types of genomic data sets. Here, we introduce simplitigs as a compact, efficient and scalable representation and present a fast algorithm for their computation. On examples of several model organisms and two bacterial pan-genomes, we show that, compared to the best existing representation, simplitigs provide a substantial improvement in the cumulative sequence length and their number, especially for graphs with many branching nodes. We demonstrate that this improvement is amplified with more data available. Combined with the commonly used Burrows-Wheeler Transform index of genomic sequences, simplitigs substantially reduce both memory and index loading and query times, as illustrated with large-scale examples of GenBank bacterial pan-genomes.",
