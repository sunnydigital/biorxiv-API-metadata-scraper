    "abstract": "Sensory data about most natural task-relevant variables are entangled with task-irrelevant nuisance variables. The neurons that encode these relevant signals typically constitute a nonlinear population code. Here we present a theoretical framework for quantifying how the brain uses or decodes its nonlinear information. Our theory obeys fundamental mathematical limitations on information content inherited from the sensory periphery, identifying redundant codes when there are many more cortical neurons than primary sensory neurons. The theory predicts that if the brain uses its nonlinear population codes optimally, then more informative patterns should be more correlated with choices. More specifically, the theory predicts a simple, easily computed quantitative relationship between fluctuating neural activity and behavioral choices that reveals the decoding efficiency. We analyze recordings from primary visual cortex of monkeys discriminating the distribution from which oriented stimuli were drawn, and find these data are consistent with the hypothesis of near-optimal nonlinear decoding.",

    "abstract": "Based on rodent models, researchers have theorized that the hippocampus supports episodic memory and navigation via the theta oscillation, a ~4-10-Hz rhythm that coordinates brain-wide neural activity. However, recordings from humans have indicated that hippocampal theta oscillations are lower in frequency and less prevalent than in rodents, suggesting interspecies differences in thetas function. To characterize human hippocampal theta, we examined the properties of theta oscillations throughout the anterior-posterior length of the hippocampus as neurosurgical subjects performed a virtual spatial navigation task. During virtual movement, we observed hippocampal oscillations at multiple frequencies from 2 to 14 Hz. The posterior hippocampus prominently displayed oscillations at ~8-Hz and the precise frequency of these oscillations correlated with the speed of movement, implicating these signals in spatial navigation. We also observed slower ~3-Hz oscillations, but these signals were more prevalent in the anterior hippocampus and their frequency did not vary with movement speed. Our results converge with recent findings to suggest an updated view of human hippocampal electrophysiology. Rather than one hippocampal theta oscillation with a single general role, high-and low-theta oscillations, respectively, may reflect spatial and non-spatial cognitive processes.",

    "abstract": "Visual dual stream theory posits that two distinct neural pathways of specific functional significance originate from primary visual areas and reach the inferior temporal (ventral) and posterior parietal areas (dorsal). However, there are several unresolved questions concerning the fundamental aspects of this theory. For example, is the functional dissociation between ventral and dorsal stream driven by features in input stimuli or is it driven by categorical differences between visuo-perceptual and visuo-motor functions? Is the dual stream rigid or flexible? What is the nature of the interactions between two streams? We addressed these questions using fMRI recordings on healthy human volunteers and employing stimuli and tasks that can tease out the divergence between visuo-perceptual and visuo-motor models of dual stream theory. fMRI scans were repeated after seven practice sessions that were conducted in a non-MRI environment to investigate the effects of neuroplasticity. Brain activation analysis supports an input-based functional dissociation and existence of context-dependent neuroplasticity in dual stream areas. Intriguingly, premotor cortex activation was observed in the position perception task and distributed deactivated regions were observed in all perception tasks thus, warranting a network level analysis. Dynamic causal modelling (DCM) analysis incorporating activated and deactivated brain areas during perception tasks indicates that the brain dynamics during visual perception and actions could be interpreted within the framework of predictive coding. Effectively, the network level findings point towards the existence of more intricate context-driven functional networks selective of \"what\" and \"where\" information rather than segregated streams of processing along ventral and dorsal brain regions.",

We utilized whole-exome sequencing of rice DNA in order to understand the properties of ion beam-induced mutations in a genome-wide manner. DNA libraries were constructed from selected carbon-ion-beam-induced rice mutants by capturing with a custom probes covering 66.3 M bases of nearly all exons and miRNAs predicted in the genome. A total of 56 mutations, including 24 single nucleotide variations, 23 deletions, and 5 insertions, were detected in five mutant rice lines (two dwarf and three early-heading-date mutants). The mutations were distributed among all 12 chromosomes, and the average mutation frequency in the M1 generation was estimated to be 2.7 x 10-7 per base. Many single base insertions and deletions were associated with homopolymeric repeats, whereas larger deletions up to seven base pairs were observed at polynucleotide repeats in the DNA sequences of the mutation sites. Of the 56 mutations, six were classified as high-impact mutations that caused a frame shift or loss of exons. A gene that was functionally related to the phenotype of the mutant was disrupted by a high-impact mutation in four of the five lines tested, suggesting that whole-exome sequencing of ion-beam-irradiated mutants could facilitate the detection of candidate genes responsible for the mutant phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a standard tool to investigate the neural correlates of cognition. fMRI noninvasively measures brain activity, allowing identification of patterns evoked by tasks performed during scanning. Despite the long history of this technique, the idiosyncrasies of each dataset have led to the use of ad-hoc preprocessing protocols customized for nearly every different study. This approach is time-consuming, error-prone, and unsuitable for combining datasets from many sources. Here we showcase fMRIPrep (http://fmriprep.org), a robust tool to prepare human fMRI data for statistical analysis. This software instrument addresses the reproducibility concerns of the established protocols for fMRI preprocessing. By leveraging the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) to standardize both the input datasets --MRI data as stored by the scanner-- and the outputs --data ready for modeling and analysis--, fMRIPrep is capable of preprocessing a diversity of datasets without manual intervention. In support of the growing popularity of fMRIPrep, this protocol describes how to integrate the tool in a task-based fMRI investigation workflow.",

    "abstract": "Local interactions among individual members of a population can generate intricate small-scale spatial structure, which can strongly influence population dynamics. The two-way interplay between local interactions and population dynamics is well understood in the relatively simple case where the population occupies a fixed domain with a uniform average density. However, the situation where the average population density is spatially varying is less well understood. This situation includes ecologically important scenarios such as species invasions, range shifts, and moving population fronts. Here, we investigate the dynamics of the spatial stochastic logistic model in a scenario where an initially confined population subsequently invades new, previously unoccupied territory. This simple model combines density-independent proliferation with dispersal, and density-dependent mortality via competition with other members of the population. We show that, depending on the spatial scales of dispersal and competition, either a clustered or a regular spatial structure develops over time within the invading population. In the short-range dispersal case, the invasion speed is significantly lower than standard predictions of the mean-field model. We conclude that mean-field models, even when they account for non-local processes such as dispersal and competition, can give misleading predictions for the speed of a moving invasion front.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging can indirectly infer the microstructure of tissues and provide metrics subject to normal variability in a population. Potentially abnormal values may yield essential information to support analysis of controls and patients cohorts, but subtle confounds could be mistaken for purely biologically driven variations amongst subjects. In this work, we propose a new harmonization algorithm based on adaptive dictionary learning to mitigate the unwanted variability caused by different scanner hardware while preserving the natural biological variability of the data. Our harmonization algorithm does not require paired training datasets, nor spatial registration or matching spatial resolution. Overcomplete dictionaries are learned iteratively from all datasets at the same time with an adaptive regularization criterion. removing variability attributable to the scanners in the process. The obtained mapping is applied directly in the native space of each subject towards a scanner-space. The method is evaluated with a public database which consists of two different protocols acquired on three different scanners. Results show that the effect size of the four studied diffusion metrics is preserved while removing variability attributable to the scanner. Experiments with alterations using a free water compartment, which is not simulated in the training data, shows that the modifications applied to the diffusion weighted images are preserved in the diffusion metrics after harmonization, while still reducing global variability at the same time. The algorithm could help multicenter studies pooling their data by removing scanner specific confounds, and increase statistical power in the process.",

    "abstract": "In many species, cultures, and contexts, social dominance reflects the ability to exert influence over others, and the question of what makes an effective leader is pertinent to a range of disciplines and contexts. While dominant individuals are often assumed to be most influential, the behavioral traits that make them dominant may also make them socially aversive and thereby reduce their influence. Here we examine the influence of dominant and subordinate males on group behavior in different social contexts using the cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni. We find that phenotypically dominant males display behavioral traits that typify leadership across taxonomic systems - aggressive, social centrality, and movement leadership, while subordinate males are passive, socially peripheral, and have little influence over movement. However, in a more complex group-consensus task involving visual cue associations, subordinate males become the most effective agents of social change. We find that dominant males are spatially distant and have lower signal-to-noise ratios of informative behavior in the association task, potentially interfering with their ability to generate group-consensus. In contrast, subordinate males are physically close to other group members, have high signal-to-noise behaviors in the association task, and visual connectivity to other group members equal to that of dominant males. The attributes that define effective social influence are therefore highly context-specific, with socially and phenotypically dominant males being influential in routine but not complex social scenarios. These results demonstrate that behavioral traits that are typical of socially dominant individuals may actually reduce their social influence in other contexts.\n\nSignificance StatementThe attributes that allow individuals to attain positions of social power and dominance are common across many vertebrate social systems - aggression, intimidation, coercion. Yet these traits are socially aversive, and can make dominant individuals poor agents of social change. In a vertebrate system (social cichlid fish) we show that dominant males are aggressive, socially central, and lead group movement. Yet dominant males are poor effectors of consensus in an more sophisticated association task compared with passive, socially-peripheral subordinate males. The most effective agents of social influence possess behavioral traits opposite of those typically found in position of social dominance, suggesting the behavioral processes that generate social dominance may simultaneously place the most ineffective leaders in positions of power.",

    "abstract": "The capacity to navigate by layout geometry has been widely recognized as a robust navigational strategy. It was reported in various species, albeit most studies were performed with vision-based paradigms. In the presented study, we aimed to investigate layout symmetry-based navigation in the house cricket, Acheta domesticus, in the absence of visual cues. For this purpose, we used a non-visual paradigm modeled on the Tennessee Williams setup. We also verified the inaccessibility of visual cues for tested insects using antennal positioning reflex towards looming stimulus and by testing the performance of blinded crickets. In the main experiment, we tested the crickets capacity to learn to find a cool spot positioned centrally in heated arenas of different shapes (i.e., circular, square, triangular, and asymmetric quadrilateral). We found that the symmetry of the arena significantly facilitates crickets learning to find the cool spot, indicated by the increase of time spent on the cool spot and decrease of the latency of locating it in subsequent trials. To investigate possible mechanisms utilized by crickets during the experiment, we analyzed insects approach paths to the spot. The trajectories were grouped in four distinct clusters corresponding to both heuristic and directed strategies of approaching the target, with the dominance of a semi-directed strategy (thigmotactic phase preceding direct navigation to the target). Against these results, we discuss the possibility of insects navigation by using a non-visual space representation and possible limitations of navigation capacities in such conditions in relation to multimodally-guided navigation.",

    "abstract": "Stem and progenitor populations within developing embryos are diverse, composed of different subpopulations of precursor cells with varying developmental potential. How these different subpopulations are coordinately regulated by their signaling environments is not well understood. In this paper we develop a framework for controlling progenitor population structure in cell culture using high-throughput single cell mRNA-seq and computational analysis. We find that the natural transcriptional diversity of neural stem cell populations from the developing mouse brain collapses during in vitro culture. Cell populations are depleted of committed neuroblast progenitors and become dominated by a single pre-astrocytic cell population. By analyzing the response of neural stem cell populations to forty combinatorial signaling conditions, we demonstrate that signaling environments can restructure cell populations by modulating the relative abundance of pre-astrocytic and pre-neuronal subpopulations according to a simple log-linear model. Our work demonstrates that single-cell RNA-seq can be applied to learn how to modulate the diversity of stem cell populations, providing a new strategy for population-level stem cell control.\n\nHighlightsO_LINatural progenitor diversity in the brain collapses during in vitro culture to a single progenitor type\nC_LIO_LILoss of progenitor diversity alters fate potential of cells during differentiation\nC_LIO_LILarge scale single-cell signaling screen identifies signals that reshape population structure towards neuronal cell types\nC_LIO_LISignals regulate population structure according to a simple log-linear model\nC_LI\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=89 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/890087v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e5286corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c0e69borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@640b20org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16779e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Effective delivery of proteins into the cytosol and nucleus of mammalian cells would open the door to a wide range of applications including treatment of many currently intractable diseases. However, despite great efforts from numerous investigators and the development of a variety of innovative methods, effective protein delivery in a clinical setting is yet to be accomplished. Herein we report a potentially general approach to engineering cell-permeable proteins by genetically grafting a short cell-penetrating peptide to an exposed loop region of a protein of interest. The grafted peptide is conformationally constrained by the protein structure, sharing the structural features of cyclic cell-penetrating peptides and exhibiting enhanced proteolytic stability and cellular entry efficiency. Insertion of an amphipathic motif, Arg-Arg-Arg-Arg-Trp-Trp-Trp, into the loop regions of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), and purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) rendered all three proteins cell-permeable and biologically active in cellular assays. When added into growth medium, the engineered PTP1B dose-dependently reduced the phosphotyrosine levels of intracellular proteins, while the modified PNP protected PNP-deficient mouse T lymphocytes (NSU-1) against toxic levels of deoxyguanosine, providing a potential enzyme replacement therapy for a rare genetic disease.",

    "abstract": "Interactions of ligands with biological macromolecules are sensitively detected through changes of chemical shifts and line shapes of the NMR signals. This paper reports a mathematical analysis and simulations of NMR line shapes expected in titrations when ligand binding is coupled to multiple isomerization transitions. Such molecular mechanisms may correspond to ligand binding by intrinsically disordered proteins or by autoinhibited enzymes. Based on the simulation results, we anticipate several specific effects that may be observed in practice. First, the presence of non-binding conformers of the receptor molecule leads to a remarkable broadening in the binding transition even if the exchange between binding and non-binding conformers is very slow. Second, the ligand-binding mechanisms involving induced fit are expected to demonstrate deceptively decelerated exchange regimes even when the underlying kinetics are very fast. Conversely, the observation of fast-exchange shifting resonances with modest line-broadening (\"marching peaks\") in practical NMR titrations may involve conformational selection transitions but less likely to be observed for the induced fit. Finally, in auto-inhibited molecules that open to form multiple binding-competent conformers, the fast dynamics of opening/closing transition are capable of masking the true kinetics of interconversion among transiently open forms of the receptor.",

    "abstract": "Ric-8A is a cytosolic Guanine Nucleotide exchange Factor (GEF) that activates heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunits (G)1. Ric-8A is essential to life in multicellular eukaryotes by virtue of its chaperone activity that is required for G biogenesis and membrane localization2, 3. Ric-8A adopts an armadillo (ARM)/HEAT repeat domain architecture and is structurally unrelated to G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCR)4. Both GEF and chaperone activities are stimulated by Casein Kinase II phosphorylation5. The mechanisms by which Ric-8A catalyzes GDP release and GTP binding to G, or exerts chaperone activity are unknown. Here, we report the structure of the nanobody-stabilized complex of nucleotide-free Gi1 (isoform 1 of G family i) and phosphorylated Ric-8A at near atomic resolution by cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography. We find that Ric-8A envelops the GTPase domain of G, disrupting all three switch regions that convey G nucleotide-binding and signaling activity, and displaces the C-terminal helix and helical domain of G. These cooperative interactions dismantle the GDP binding site and promote GDP release, while protecting structural elements of G that are dynamic in the nucleotide-free state. The structures also show how in vivo phosphorylation stabilizes G-binding elements of Ric-8A, thereby enhancing its GEF and chaperone activities.",

    "abstract": "The coordinated transcription of genes involves the regulated release of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) from promoter-proximal sites into active elongation. DNA lesions in transcribed strands block elongation and induce a strong transcriptional arrest. The transcription-coupled repair (TCR) pathway efficiently removes transcription-blocking DNA lesions, but this is not sufficient to resume transcription. Through proteomics screens, we find that the TCR-specific CSB protein loads the evolutionary conserved PAF1 complex (PAF1C) onto RNAPII in promoter-proximal regions in response to DNA damage. PAF1C is dispensable for TCR-mediated repair, but is essential for recovery of RNA synthesis after UV irradiation, suggesting an uncoupling between DNA repair and transcription recovery. Moreover, we find that PAF1C promotes RNAPII pause release in promoter-proximal regions and subsequently acts as a processivity factor that stimulates transcription elongation throughout genes. Our findings expose the molecular basis for a non-canonical PAF1C-dependent pathway that restores transcription throughout the human genome after genotoxic stress.",

    "abstract": "The regulated secretory trafficking of neosynthesized transmembrane receptors is particularly challenging to investigate as it is under-represented at steady state compared to the abundance of the other trafficking routes. Here, we combined the retention using selective hook (RUSH) system to a CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing approach (eRUSH) to identify molecular players involved in the trafficking of neosynthesized Transferrin Receptor (TfR) en route to the plasma membrane (PM). TfR-eRUSH monoclonal cells expressing endogenous, ER-retainable and fluorescent TfR were engineered and characterized. Spatiotemporal quantitative proteomics of TfR-eRUSH cells allowed the identification of molecular partners associated with TfR-containing membranes and provided a comprehensive list of potential regulators, co-trafficking cargos, and enriched pathways. Furthermore, we chose to focus our attention on the Rab GTPase family members for their function as vesicle trafficking regulators and performed a Rab-targeted siRNA screen that we correlated to our proteomics data. Unexpectedly, we identified Rab7-harboring vesicles as an intermediate compartment of the Golgi-to-PM transport of the neosynthetic TfR. These vesicles did not exhibit degradative properties and were not associated to Rab6A-harboring vesicles, also involved in Golgi-to-PM transport. However, Rab6A-TfR vesicles delivered TfR directly to the PM, while in contrast, Rab7A was transiently associated to neosynthetic TfR-containing post-Golgi vesicles but dissociated before PM vesicle fusion. Together, our study proposes the eRUSH as a powerful tool to further study the secretory pathway and reveals an unforeseen role for Rab7 in the neosynthetic transport of the TfR, highlighting the diversity of the secretory vesicles nature for a given cargo.",

    "abstract": "Cannabis is a diverse and polymorphic species. To better understand cannabinoid synthesis inheritance and its impact on pathogen resistance, we shotgun sequenced and assembled a Cannabis trio (sibling pair and their offspring) utilizing long read single molecule sequencing. This resulted in the most contiguous Cannabis sativa assemblies to date. These reference assemblies were further annotated with full-length male and female mRNA sequencing (Iso-Seq) to help inform isoform complexity, gene model predictions and identification of the Y chromosome. To further annotate the genetic diversity in the species, 40 male, female, and monoecious cannabis and hemp varietals were evaluated for copy number variation (CNV) and RNA expression. This identified multiple CNVs governing cannabinoid expression and 82 genes associated with resistance to Golovinomyces chicoracearum, the causal agent of powdery mildew in cannabis. Results indicated that breeding for plants with low tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) concentrations may result in deletion of pathogen resistance genes. Low THCA cultivars also have a polymorphism every 51 bases while dispensary grade high THCA cannabis exhibited a variant every 73 bases. A refined genetic map of the variation in cannabis can guide more stable and directed breeding efforts for desired chemotypes and pathogen-resistant cultivars.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/894428v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (126K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7a1ac3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@731a4dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c3e5acorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11babb4_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Sequence and annotation of 42 cannabis genomes reveals extensive copy number variation in cannabinoid synthesis and pathogen resistance genes\n\nC_FIG",
