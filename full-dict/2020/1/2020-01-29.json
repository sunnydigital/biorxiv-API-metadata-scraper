    "abstract": "Oligodendrocyte loss in neurological disease leaves axons vulnerable to damage and degeneration, and activity-dependent myelination may represent an endogenous mechanism to improve remyelination following injury. Here, we report that while learning a forelimb reach task transiently suppresses oligodendrogenesis, it subsequently increases OPC differentiation, oligodendrocyte generation, and retraction of pre-existing myelin sheaths in the forelimb region of motor cortex. Immediately following demyelination, motor cortex neurons exhibit hyperexcitability, motor learning is impaired, and behavioral intervention provides no long-term benefit to remyelination. However, partial remyelination restores neuronal and behavioral function. Motor learning following partial remyelination increases oligodendrogenesis and enhances the ability of mature oligodendrocytes to generate new myelin sheaths, resulting in almost double the remyelination of denuded axons relative to untrained controls. Together, our findings demonstrate that the correct timing of behaviorally-induced neuronal circuit activation improves recovery from demyelinating injury via enhanced remyelination from new and surviving oligodendrocytes.",

Our results demonstrate the phenotypic richness of a basic state diagram structure, and suggest a novel function for apoptosis.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe relationship between transcription and the 3D genome organization is one of the most important questions in molecular biology, but the roles of transcription in 3D chromatin remain controversial. Multiple groups showed that transcription affects global Cohesin binding and genome 3D structures. At the same time, several studies have indicated that transcription inhibition does not affect global chromatin interactions.\n\nResultsHere, we provide the most comprehensive evidence to date to demonstrate that transcription plays a marginal role in organizing the 3D genome in mammalian cells: 1) degraded Pol I, Pol II and Pol III proteins in mESCs, and showed their loss results in little or no changes of global 3D chromatin structures for the first time; 2) selected RNA polymerases high abundance binding sites-associated interactions and found they still persist after the degradation; 3) generated higher resolution chromatin interaction maps and revealed that transcription inhibition mildly alters small loop domains; 4) identified Pol II bound but CTCF and Cohesin unbound loops and disclosed that they are largely resistant to transcription inhibition. Interestingly, Pol II depletion for a longer time significantly affects the chromatin accessibility and Cohesin occupancy, suggesting RNA polymerases are capable of affecting the 3D genome indirectly. So, the direct and indirect effects of transcription inhibition explain the previous confusing effects on the 3D genome.\n\nConclusionsWe conclude that Pol I, Pol II, and Pol III loss only mildly alter chromatin interactions in mammalian cells, suggesting the 3D chromatin structures are pre-established and relatively stable.",

However, the discovery of modules of genes working in concert to manifest a complex trait has been crippled by combinatorial complexity, genetic heterogeneity, and validation biases. We introduce Maestro, a novel network approach that employs a multifaceted correlation measure, which captures heterogeneity, and a rigorous validation method. Maestros utilization for Alzheimers disease (AD) reveals an expression pattern that has virtually zero probability of simultaneous expression by an individual, assuming independence. Yet this pattern is exhibited by 19.0% of AD cases and 7.3% of controls, establishing an unprecedented pattern of synchronized genetic activities in the human brain. This pattern is significantly associated with AD, with an odds ratio of 3.0. This study substantiates Maestros power for discovery of orchestrated genetic activities underlying complex traits. More generally, Maestro can be applied in diverse domains in which heterogeneity exists.\n\nHighlightsO_LISynchronized genetic activities associated with Alzheimers disease\nC_LIO_LINovel vector-based correlation measure that captures genetic heterogeneity\nC_LIO_LIEnhanced network model for revealing combinatorial genetic interactions\nC_LIO_LIPro-survival genetic activities associated with Alzheimers disease\nC_LIO_LIGeneral approach for revealing patterns in data subject to heterogeneity\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The availability of single-cell transcriptomics data opens new opportunities for rational design of combination cancer treatments. Mining such data, we employed combinatorial optimization techniques to explore the landscape of optimal combination therapies in solid tumors including brain, head and neck, melanoma, lung, breast and colon cancers. We assume that each individual therapy can target any one of 1269 genes encoding cell surface receptors, which may be targets of CAR-T, conjugated antibodies or coated nanoparticle therapies. As a baseline case, we studied the killing of at least 80% of the tumor cells while sparing more than 90% of the non-tumor cells in each patient, as a putative regimen. We find that in most cancer types, personalized combinations composed of at most four targets are then sufficient. However, the number of distinct targets that one would need to assemble to treat all patients in a cohort accordingly would be around 10 in most cases. Further requiring that the target genes be also lowly expressed in healthy tissues uncovers qualitatively similar trends. However, as one asks for more stringent and selective killing beyond the baseline regimen we focused on, we find that the number of targets needed rises rapidly. Emerging individual promising receptor targets include PTPRZ1, which is frequently found in the optimal combinations for brain and head and neck cancers, and EGFR, a recurring target in multiple tumor types. In sum, this systematic single-cell based characterization of the landscape of combinatorial receptor-mediated cancer treatments establishes first of their kind estimates on the number of targets needed, identifying promising ones for future development.",

Blood, adipose, and hypothalamic tissues were collected and processed for cyto/adipokine ELISAs, immunoblot analysis, and quantitative RT-PCR.

We identified two JAK inhibitors that block cytokine-mediated adipocyte lipolysis and IL-6 induction using an in vitro CX lipolysis assay. JAK inhibitors administered to in vivo colon cancer CX mouse models led to 1) a decrease in STAT3 phosphorylation in hypothalamic and adipose tissues, 2) a reverse in the CX serum cyto/adipokine signature, 3) a delay in colon cancer CX-associated anorexia and adipose loss, and 4) an improvement in overall survival.\n\nConclusionsJAK inhibitors suppress cytokine-associated adipose loss and anorexia in multiple in vitro and in vivo models of cancer CX.",

    "abstract": "Genetic variation in a pathogen, including the causative agent of salmonellosis, Salmonella enterica, can occur as a result of eco-evolutionary forces triggered by dissimilarities of ecological niches. Here, we applied comparative genomics to study 90 antimicrobial resistant (AMR) S. enterica isolates from bovine and human hosts in New York state and Washington state to understand host- and geographic-associated population structure. Results revealed distinct presence/absence profiles of functional genes and pseudogenes (e.g., virulence genes) associated with bovine and human isolates. Notably, bovine isolates contained significantly more transposase genes but fewer transposase pseudogenes than human isolates, suggesting the occurrence of large-scale transposition in genomes of bovine and human isolates at different times. The high correlation between transposase genes and AMR genes, as well as plasmid replicons, highlights the potential role of horizontally transferred transposons in promoting adaptation to antibiotics. By contrast, a number of potentially geographic-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rather than geographic-associated genes, were identified. Interestingly, 38% of these SNPs were in genes annotated as cell surface protein-encoding genes, including some essential for antibiotic resistance and host colonization. Overall, different evolutionary forces and limited recent inter-population transmission appear to shape AMR S. enterica population structure in different hosts and geographic origins.\n\nOriginality/Significance StatementSalmonella enterica, which is the causative agent of salmonellosis, poses a growing public health concern due to the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) strains. The mechanisms underlying the population structure associated with different hosts and geographic origins of AMR S. enterica are underexplored due to limited genome-wide studies assessing the impact of ecological niches on genetic variations. By employing comparative genomics, our study provided insights into the genomic profiles of AMR S. enterica associated with two distinct hosts and two distant geographic locations, improving the mechanistic understanding of how bacterial population structure is shaped by different ecological niches. Our findings have broad implications for elucidating the impact of ecological and evolutionary forces on the adaptation, antimicrobial resistance, and pathogenicity of bacteria. Also, specific genetic markers we identified may help predict host or geographic origin of AMR Salmonella isolates, which could benefit the source tracking (e.g., host and geographic origins) of human disease cases and contamination events caused by AMR S. enterica.",

    "abstract": "The TonB system of Escherichia coli couples the protonmotive force of the cytoplasmic membrane to active transport of nutrients across the outer membrane. In the cytoplasmic membrane, this system consists of three known proteins, TonB, ExbB, and ExbD. ExbB and ExbD appear to harvest the protonmotive force and transmit it to TonB, which then makes direct physical contact with TonB-dependent active transport proteins in the outer membrane. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, we found that ExbD exists as two different species with the same apparent molecular mass but with different pIs. The more basic ExbD species was consistently present, while the more acidic species arose when cells were starved for iron by the addition of iron chelators. The cause of the modification was, however, more complex than simple iron starvation. Absence of either TonB or ExbB protein also gave rise to modified ExbD under iron-replete conditions where the wild-type strain exhibited no ExbD modification. The effect of the tonB or exbB mutations were not entirely due to iron limitation since an equally iron-limited aroB mutation did not replicate the ExbD modification. This constitutes the first report of in vivo modification for any of the TonB system proteins.",

    "abstract": "Since the inception of the discipline, understanding causal complexity in ecological communities has been a challenge. Here we draw insights from recent work on constraint closure that suggests ways of grappling with ecological complexity that yield generalizable theoretical insights. Using a set of evolutionary constraints on species flow through ecological communities, which include: selection, species drift, dispersal, and speciation, combined with multispecies interactions such as mutualistic interactions, and abiotic constraints, we demonstrate how constraint closure allows communities to emerge as semi-autonomous structures. Here we develop an agent-based model to explore how evolutionary constraints provide stability to ecological communities. The model is written in Netlogo, an agent based-modeling system, with advanced tools for manipulating spatially structured models and tools for tracking pattern formation. We articulate ways that ecological pattern formation, viewed through the lens of constraint closure, informs questions about stability and turnover in community ecology. The role of the chosen constraints was clear from the simulation results. It took the shape of both inducing stability and creating conditions for a more dynamic community with increases in species turnover through time. Key ecological and evolutionary variables showed overall stability in the landscape structure when plotted against the number of constraints, suggesting that these evolutionary forces act as constraints to the flow of species in such a way that constraint closure is achieved effecting semi-autonomy.\n\nAuthor SummaryEcosystems are among the most complex structures studied. They comprise elements that seem both stable and contingent. The stability of these systems depends on interactions among their evolutionary history, including the accidents of organisms moving through the landscape and microhabitats of the earth, and the biotic and abiotic conditions in which they occur. When ecosystems are stable, how is that achieved? Here we look at ecosystem stability through a computer simulation model that suggests that it may depend on what constrains the system and how those constraints are structured. Specifically, if the constraints found in an ecological community form a closed loop, that allows particular kinds of feedback may give structure to the ecosystem processes for a period of time. In this simulation model, we look at how evolutionary forces act in such a way these closed constraint loops may form. This may explain some kinds of ecosystem stability. This work will also be valuable to ecological theorists in understanding general ideas of stability in such systems.",

Natural selection was described by Darwin2 as a process of optimization of the adaptation to environment, but optimization doesnt necessarily lead to higher intricacy. Methods of thermodynamics and thus of information theory could be suited for the examination of the increase of order and information due to evolution.\n\nHere I explain how to quantify the increase of information due to natural selection on the genotype and gene level using the observable change of allele frequencies. In populations with recombination (no linkage), the change of information content can be computed by summing up the contributions of all gene loci and thus gene loci can be treated as independent no matter what the fitness-landscape looks like. Pressure of deleterious mutations decreases information in a linear way, proportional to fitness loss and mutation rate.\n\nThe information theoretical view on evolution might open new fields of research.",

Many have shown that expert programmers exhibit remarkable differences from novices in behavioral performance, knowledge structure, and selective attention. However, the underlying differences in the brain are still unclear. We here address this issue by associating the cortical representation of source code with individual programming expertise using a data-driven decoding approach. This approach enabled us to identify seven brain regions, widely distributed in the frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices, that have a tight relationship with programming expertise. In these brain regions, functional categories of source code could be decoded from brain activity and the decoding accuracies were significantly correlated with individual behavioral performances on source-code categorization. Our results suggest that programming expertise is built up on fine-tuned cortical representations specialized for the domain of programming.",

Our results support the view that genomic diversity in recombination hotspots arises from a direct effect of recombination on mutation rather than from the effect of selective sweeps. We also use the statistic of variance due to context to compare the effect on the probability of polymorphism of contexts of various sizes. We find that when the 12 point mutations are considered separately, variance due to context increases significantly as we move from 3-mer to 5-mer and from 5-mer to 7-mer contexts. However, when all mutations are considered in aggregate, these differences are outweighed by the effect of interaction between the central base and its immediate neighbors. This interaction is itself dominated by the transition mutations, including, but not limited to, the CpG effect. We also demonstrate strand-asymmetry of contextual influence in intronic regions, which is hypothesized to be a result of transcription coupled DNA repair. We consider the extent to which the measures we have used can be used to meaningfully compare the relative magnitudes of the impact of recombination and context on mutation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundKALRN (kalirin RhoGEF kinase) is mutated in a wide range of cancers. Nevertheless, the association between KALRN mutations and the pathogenesis of cancer remains unexplored. The identification of biomarkers for cancer immunotherapy response is important considering that immunotherapies show beneficial effects only in a subset of cancer patients.\n\nMethodsWe explored the correlation between KALRN mutations and anti-tumor immunity in 10 cancer cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program by the bioinformatics approach. Moreover, we verified the findings from bioinformatics analysis by in vitro experiments. Furthermore, we explored the correlation between KALRN mutations and immunotherapy response in four cancer cohorts receiving immune checkpoint blockade therapy.\n\nResultsWe found that anti-tumor immune signatures were stronger in KALRN-mutated than in KALRN-wildtype cancers. Moreover, KALRN mutations correlated with increased tumor mutation burden and the microsatellite instability or DNA damage repair deficiency genomic properties which may explain the elevated anti-tumor immunity in KALRN-mutated cancers. Furthermore, we found that PD-L1 expression was significantly upregulated in KALRN-mutated versus KALRN-wildtype cancers. The enhanced anti-tumor immune signatures and PD-L1 expression in KALRN-mutated cancers may favor the response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy in this cancer subtype, as evidenced in four cancer cohorts receiving anti-PD-1/PD-L1/CTLA-4 immunotherapy. We further revealed that the significant association between KALRN mutations and increased anti-tumor immunity was attributed to that KALRN mutations compromised the function of KALRN target Rho GTPases on regulating DNA damage repair pathways.\n\nConclusionsThe KALRN mutation is a useful biomarker for predicting the response to immunotherapy in cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "Trichophyton rubrum is one of the leading causes of superficial skin infections worldwide. It is a keratinolytic fungus specialized in colonization of keratinized tissue of skin, hair and nails for long periods of time. The fungus encodes a wide repertoire of secreted proteases in its genome that not only aid in nutrient acquisition but also establishment of infection on the host. The proteases are synthesized in  prepro form that requires removal of the prosegment for activation. In order to gain insights into the structural association of the pro domain with the catalytic domain, we investigate the structural features of the pro domain of the secreted sedolisin member Sub16 of T. rubrum. Our results show that the pro domain of Sub16 may have inherent flexibility in the absence of the associated catalytic domain which is stabilized in complex with catalytic domain. This is the first report of structural investigation on a stand-alone pro domain of sedolisin family of subtilases that will help in design of further structural studies of this protein.",

    "abstract": "We recently used CRISPRi/a-based chemical-genetic screens and targeted cell biological, biochemical, and structural assays to determine that rigosertib, an anti-cancer agent in phase III clinical trials, kills cancer cells by destabilizing microtubules. In a recent manuscript, Reddy and co-workers suggest that this microtubule-destabilizing activity of rigosertib is mediated not by rigosertib itself but by a contaminating degradation product of rigosertib, ON01500, present in formulations obtained from commercial vendors (Baker et al., 2019). Here, we demonstrate that treatment of cells with pharmaceutical-grade rigosertib (>99.9% purity) results in qualitatively indistinguishable phenotypes as treatment with commercially obtained rigosertib across multiple assays. The two compounds have indistinguishable chemical-genetic interactions with genes involved in modulating the microtubule network (KIF2C and TACC3), both destabilize microtubules in cells and in vitro, and both show substantially reduced toxicity in cell lines expressing a rationally-designed mutant of tubulin (L240F TUBB mutant), in which the rigosertib binding site in tubulin is mutated. Importantly, the specificity of the L240F TUBB mutant for microtubule-destabilizing agents, which is disputed by Reddy and co-workers, was recently confirmed by an independent research group (Patterson et al., 2019). We conclude that rigosertib kills cancer cells by destabilizing microtubules, in agreement with our original findings.",

    "abstract": "A characteristic among many marine Gammaproteobacteria is the biosynthesis and incorporation of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids into membrane phospholipids. Biosynthesis of eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and/or docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids is accomplished using a polyketide/fatty acid synthase mechanism encoded by a set of five genes pfaABCDE. This unique fatty acid synthesis (FAS) pathway co-exists with the canonical Type II dissociated fatty acid synthesis pathway, which is responsible for the biosynthesis of saturated, monounsaturated, and hydroxylated fatty acids used in phospholipid and lipid A biosynthesis. In this work, a genetic approach was undertaken to elucidate genetic regulation of the pfa genes in the model marine bacterium Photobacterium profundum SS9. Using a reporter gene fusion, we showed that expression of the pfa operon is down regulated in response to exogenous fatty acids, particularly long chain monounsaturated fatty acids. This regulation occurs independently of the canonical fatty acid regulators, FabR and FadR, present in P. profundum SS9. Transposon mutagenesis and screening of a library of mutants identified a novel transcriptional regulator, which we have designated pfaF, to be responsible for the observed regulation of the pfa operon in P. profundum SS9. Gel mobility shift and DNase I footprinting assays confirmed that PfaF binds the pfaA promoter and identified the PfaF binding site.\n\nImportanceThe production of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) by marine Gammaproteobacteria, particularly those from deep-sea environments, has been known for decades. These unique fatty acids are produced by a polyketide-type mechanism and subsequently incorporated into the phospholipid membrane. While much research has focused on the biosynthesis genes, their products and the phylogenetic distribution of these gene clusters, no prior studies have detailed the genetic regulation of this pathway. This study describes how this pathway is regulated under various culture conditions and has identified and characterized a fatty acid responsive transcriptional regulator specific to the PUFA biosynthesis pathway.",

We also present analyses of global health data, where we use advanced functionality of LimeTr, including constraints to impose monotonicity and concavity for dose-response relationships. Nonlinear observation models allow new analyses in place of classic approximations, such as log-linear models. Robust extensions in all analyses ensure that spurious data points do not drive our understanding of either mean relationships or between-study heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Concurrent sexually transmitted infections (STI) can increase the probability of HIV-1 transmission primarily by increasing the viral load present in semen. In this study, we explored the relationship of HIV-1 in blood and seminal plasma in the presence and absence of urethritis and after treatment of the concurrent STI. Primer ID deep sequencing of the V1/V3 region of the HIV-1 env gene was done for paired blood and semen samples from ART-naive men living in Malawi with (n = 19) and without (n = 5) STI-associated urethritis; for a subset of samples full length env genes were generated for sequence analysis and to test entry phenotype. Cytokine concentrations in the blood and semen were also measured, and a reduction in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines was observed following STI treatment. We observed no difference in the prevalence of diverse compartmentalized semen-derived lineages in men with or without STI-associated urethritis, and these viral populations were largely stable during STI treatment. Clonal amplification of one or a few viral sequences accounted for nearly 50% of the viral population indicating a recent bottleneck followed by limited viral replication. We documented a case of superinfection where the new strain was restricted to the genital tract. We conclude that the male genital tract is a site where virus can be brought in from the blood, where localized sustained replication can occur, where a superinfecting strain can persist, and where specific genotypes can be amplified perhaps initially by cellular proliferation but further by limited viral replication.\n\nImportanceHIV-1 is a sexually transmitted infection that co-exists with other STIs. Here we examine the impact of a concurrent STI resulting in urethritis on the HIV-1 population within the male genital tract. We found that viral populations remain largely stable even with treatment of the STI. These results show that viral populations within the male genital tract are defined by factors beyond transient inflammation associated with a concurrent STI.",

    "abstract": "An understanding of the reproductive biology of aquatic organisms is crucial for the efficient conservation and management of species and/or populations. Nevertheless, conventional spawning surveys such as visual- and capture-based monitoring generally require laborious, time-consuming work and are subject to monitoring biases such as observer bias, as well as miscounts due to false spawning. In addition, direct capture often damages eggs or individuals. Thus, an efficient non-invasive approach for monitoring spawning activity on aquatic species would be a valuable tool to understand their reproductive biology and conserving biodiversity. Here, we proposed an environmental DNA (eDNA)-based approach for monitoring and understanding spawning activity by observing spikes in eDNA concentration after spawning activity. We found in cross experiments using two medaka species (Oryzias latipes and O. sakaizumii, 1:1 individual per tank) that an eDNA spike occurred in only male species after spawning activity. In addition, the magnitude of the eDNA spike was dependent on the number of spawning activities with egg and sperm release. In the field survey during the reproductive season, eDNA concentration after spawning were 3-25 times higher than before spawning. On the other hand, there was no increase in eDNA concentration during the non-reproductive season. Therefore, our results demonstrated that spikes in the eDNA concentration are mainly caused by the release of sperm during spawning activity, and it can be used as evidence of spawning in field survey. The presented approach could be a practical tool for studying reproductive biology and provides an opportunity to design effective conservation and environmental management actions.",

    "abstract": "The segmentation of structural MRI data is an essential step for deriving geometrical information about brain tissues. One important application is in transcranial electrical stimulation (e.g., tDCS), a non-invasive neuromodulatory technique where head modeling is required to determine the electric field (E-field) generated in the cortex to predict and optimize its effects. Here we propose a deep learning-based model (StarNEt) to automatize white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) segmentation and compare its performance with FreeSurfer, an established tool. Since good definition of sulci and gyri in the cortical surface is an important requirement for E-field calculation, StarNEt is specifically designed to output masks at a higher resolution than that of the original input T1w-MRI. StarNEt uses a residual network as the encoder (ResNet) and a fully convolutional neural network with U-net skip connections as the decoder to segment an MRI slice by slice. Slice vertical location is provided as an extra input. The model was trained on scans from 425 patients in the open-access ADNI+IXI datasets, and using FreeSurfer segmentation as ground truth. Model performance was evaluated using the Dice Coefficient (DC) in a separate subset (N=105) of ADNI+IXI and in two extra testing sets not involved in training. In addition, FreeSurfer and StarNEt were compared to manual segmentations of the MRBrainS18 dataset, also unseen by the model. To study performance in real use cases, first, we created electrical head models derived from the FreeSurfer and StarNEt segmentations and used them for montage optimization with a common target region using a standard algorithm (Stimweaver) and second, we used StarNEt to successfully segment the brains of minimally conscious state (MCS) patients having suffered from brain trauma, a scenario where FreeSurfer typically fails. Our results indicate that StarNEt matches FreeSurfer performance on the trained tasks while reducing computation time from several hours to a few seconds, and with the potential to evolve into an effective technique even when patients present large brain abnormalities.",

COMT is the predominate regulator of dopamine turnover in regions of the brain with low levels of dopamine transporters, including the prefrontal cortex.

In this task, mice were given the choice between engaging in a fixed number of instrumental responses to acquire a strawberry milk reward and consuming standard lab chow concurrently available on the chamber floor. We found no significant effects of tolcapone treatment on either strawberry milk earned or chow consumed compared to vehicle treatment. In contrast, we found that haloperidol decreased instrumental responding for strawberry milk and increased chow consumption as seen in previously published studies.

    "abstract": "As stroke mortality rates decrease, there has been a surge of effort to study post-stroke dementia (PSD) to improve long-term quality of life for stroke survivors. Hippocampal volume may be an important neuroimaging biomarker in post-stroke dementia, as it has been associated with many other forms of dementia. However, studying hippocampal volume using MRI requires hippocampal segmentation. Advances in automated segmentation methods have allowed for studying the hippocampus on a large scale, which is important for robust results in the heterogeneous stroke population. However, most of these automated methods use a single atlas-based approach and may fail in the presence of severe structural abnormalities common in stroke. Hippodeep, a new convolutional neural network-based hippocampal segmentation method, does not rely solely on a single atlas-based approach and thus may be better suited for stroke populations. Here, we compared quality control and the accuracy of segmentations generated by Hippodeep and two well-accepted hippocampal segmentation methods on stroke MRIs (FreeSurfer 6.0 whole hippocampus and FreeSurfer 6.0 sum of hippocampal subfields). Quality control was performed using a stringent protocol for visual inspection of the segmentations, and accuracy was measured as volumetric and spatial comparisons to the manual segmentations. Hippodeep performed significantly better than both FreeSurfer methods in terms of quality control and spatial accuracy. Overall, this study suggests that both Hippodeep and FreeSurfer may be useful for hippocampal segmentation in stroke rehabilitation research, but Hippodeep may be more robust to stroke lesion anatomy.",

    "abstract": "Growth and starvation are considered opposite ends of a spectrum. To sustain growth, cells must manage biomolecule supply to balance constructive metabolism with high translation, through coordinated gene expression programs. Global growth programs couple increased ribosomal biogenesis with sufficient carbon metabolism, amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis, and how this is collectively managed is a fundamental question. Conventionally, the role of the Gcn4/ATF4 transcription factor has been studied only in the context of amino acid starvation. However, high Gcn4/ATF4 has been observed in contexts of rapid cell proliferation, and the specific role of Gcn4 in growth contexts are unclear. Here, using a methionine-induced growth program in yeast, we show that Gcn4/ATF4 is the fulcrum through which metabolic supply dependent sustenance of translation outputs is maintained. Integrating time-matched transcriptome and ChIP-Seq analysis, we decipher genome-wide direct and indirect roles for Gcn4 in this growth program. Genes that enable metabolic precursor biosynthesis indispensably require Gcn4; contrastingly ribosomal genes are partly repressed by Gcn4. Gcn4 directly binds promoter-regions and transcribes a subset of metabolic genes, particularly driving lysine and arginine biosynthesis. Gcn4 also globally represses lys/arg enriched transcripts, which include the translation machinery. The sustained Gcn4 dependent lys/arg supply is required to maintain sufficient translation capacity, by allowing the synthesis of the translation machinery itself. Gcn4 thereby enables metabolic-precursor supply to bolster protein synthesis, and drive a growth program. Thus, we illustrate how growth and starvation outcomes are both controled using the same Gcn4 transcriptional outputs, in entirely distinct contexts.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "We consider the question of how sensory networks enable the detection of sensory stimuli in a combinatorial coding space. We are specifically interested in the olfactory system, wherein recent experimental studies have reported the existence of rich, enigmatic response patterns associated with stimulus onset and offset. This study aims to identify the functional relevance of such response patterns, i.e., what benefits does such neural activity provide in the context of detecting stimuli in a natural environment. We study this problem through the lens of normative, optimization-based modeling. Here, we define the notion of a low dimensional latent representation of stimulus identity, which is generated through action of the sensory network. The objective of our optimization framework is to ensure high fidelity tracking of a nominal representation in this latent space in an energy efficient manner. It turns out that the optimal motifs emerging from this framework possess morphological similarity with prototypical onset and offset responses observed in vivo. Furthermore, this objective can be exactly achieved by a network with reciprocal excitatory-inhibitory competitive dynamics, similar to interactions between principal neurons (PNs) and local neurons (LNs) in the early olfactory system of insects. The derived model also makes several predictions regarding maintenance of robust latent representations in the presence of confounding background information and tradeoffs between the energy of sensory activity and resultant behavioral measures such as speed and accuracy of stimulus detection.\n\nSignificance StatementA key area of study in olfactory coding involves understanding the transformation from high-dimensional sensory stimulus to low-dimensional decoded representation. Here, we treat not only the dimensionality reduction of this mapping but also its temporal dynamics, with specific focus on stimuli that are temporally continuous. We examine through optimization-based synthesis how sensory networks can track representations without prior assumption of discrete trial structure. We show that such tracking can be achieved by canonical network architectures and dynamics, and that the resulting responses resemble observations from neurons in the insect olfactory system. Thus, our results provide hypotheses regarding the functional role of olfactory circuit activity at both single neuronal and population scales.",

However, differences between these datasets, in their variants tested, allele codings, and in the transcriptional features quantified, are a barrier to their widespread use. Consequently, target genes for most GWAS signals have still not been identified. Here, we present the eQTL Catalogue (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eqtl/), a resource which contains quality controlled, uniformly recomputed QTLs from 21 eQTL studies. We find that for matching cell types and tissues, the eQTL effect sizes are highly reproducible between studies, enabling the integrative analysis of these data. Although most cis-eQTLs were shared between most bulk tissues, the analysis of purified cell types identified a greater diversity of cell-type-specific eQTLs, a subset of which also manifested as novel disease colocalisations. Our summary statistics can be downloaded by FTP, accessed via a REST API, and visualised on the Ensembl genome browser. New datasets will continuously be added to the eQTL Catalogue, enabling the systematic interpretation of human GWAS associations across many cell types and tissues.",

    "abstract": "The expression of territorial behavior in wild species is especially suited to explore how animals integrate individual traits with dynamic environmental and social contexts. In this study, we focused on the seasonal variation of the determinants of territory size in the weakly electric fish Gymnotus omarorum. This species is a seasonal breeder that displays year-long territorial aggression, in which female and male dyads exhibit indistinguishable non-breeding territorial agonistic behavior and the only significant predictor of contest outcome is body size. We carried out field surveys across seasons that included the identification of individual location, measurements of water physico-chemical variables, characterization of individual morphometric and physiological traits, and their correlation to spatial distribution. Although Gymnotus omarorum tolerates a wide range of dissolved oxygen concentration, territory size correlated with dissolved oxygen in both seasons. In the non-breeding season, we show that territory size is sexually monomorphic and explained only by body size. In the breeding season, while body size no longer correlated with territory size, evidence of sexual differences in territory size determinants emerged. First, the overall spatial arrangement adopted a sexual bias. Second, territory size depended on gonadal hormones in both sexes, which was expected for males, but not previously reported in females. Third, females territory size correlated with gonadal size and females showed relatively larger territories than males, probably to meet sexually dimorphic energetic requirements. This study provides evidence of seasonal changes in factors correlated with territory size and contributes to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying behavioral plasticity.",

    "abstract": "The histone variant macroH2A1.1 (mH2A1.1) plays a role in cancer development and metastasis-related processes. To determine the underlying molecular mechanisms, we mapped genome-wide localization of endogenous mH2A1.1 in the human breast cancer cell MDA-MB 231. We demonstrate that mH2A1.1 specifically binds to active promoters and enhancers in addition to facultative heterochromatin. Selective knock-down of mH2A1.1 deregulates expression of hundreds of highly active genes. Depending on the chromatin landscape, mH2A1.1 acts through two distinct molecular mechanisms. The first is to limit excessive transcription in a predefined environment and relies on domain recruitment of mH2A1.1 at the promoter and gene body. The second mechanism is specific to RNA Pol II (Pol II) paused genes. It requires recruitment of mH2A1.1 restricted to the TSS of these genes. Moreover, we show that these processes occur in a predefined local 3D genome organization and are largely independent of enhancer-promoter looping. Among the genes activated by mH2A1.1, genes regulating mammary tumor cell migration are mostly dependent on Pol II release for their expression level, unlike other categories of mH2A1.1-regulated genes. We thus identified an intriguing new mode of transcriptional regulation by mH2A1.1 and propose that mH2A1.1 serves as a transcriptional modulator with a potential role in assisting the conversion of promoter-locked RNA polymerase II into a productive and elongated Pol II.",

In the current study, poly(vinyl-alcohol)-carbon nanotube membranes were applied to fed batch crossflow electroultrafiltration of dilute (0.1 g/L of each species) single and binary protein solutions of -lactalbumin and hen egg-white lysozyme at pH 7.4, 4 mM ionic strength, and 1 psi. Electroultrafiltration using the poly(vinyl-alcohol)-carbon nanotube composite membranes yielded temporary enhancements in sieving for single protein filtration and in selectivity for binary protein separation compared to ultrafiltration using the unmodified PS-35 membranes. Assessment of membrane fouling based on permeate flux, zeta potential measurements, and scanning electron microscopy visualization of the conditioned membranes indicated significant resulting protein adsorption and aggregation which limited the duration of improvement during electroultrafiltration with an applied cathodic potential of -4.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). These results imply that appropriate optimization of electroultrafiltration using carbon nanotube-deposited polymeric membranes may provide substantial short-term improvements in binary protein separations.",

    "abstract": "Millions of people worldwide develop foodborne illnesses caused by Salmonella enterica (S. enterica) every year. The pathogenesis of S. enterica depends on flagella, which are appendages that the bacteria use to move through the environment. Interestingly, populations of genetically identical bacteria exhibit heterogeneity in the number of flagella. To understand this heterogeneity and the regulation of flagella quantity, we propose a mathematical model that connects the flagellar gene regulatory network to flagellar construction. A regulatory network involving more than 60 genes controls flagellar assembly. The most important member of the network is the master operon, flhDC, which encodes the FlhD4C2 protein. FlhD4C2 controls the construction of flagella by initiating the production of hook basal bodies (HBBs), protein structures that anchor the flagella to the bacterium. By connecting a model of FlhD4C2 regulation to a model of HBB construction, we investigate the roles of various feedback mechanisms. Analysis of our model suggests that a combination of regulatory mechanisms at the protein and transcriptional levels induce bistable FlhD4C2 levels and heterogeneous numbers of flagella. Also, the balance of regulatory mechanisms that become active following HBB construction is sufficient to provide a counting mechanism for controlling the total number of flagella produced.\n\nAuthor summarySalmonella causes foodborne illnesses in millions of people worldwide each year. Flagella, which are appendages that the bacteria use to move through the environment, are a key factor in the infection process. Populations of genetically identical bacteria have been observed to contain both motile cells, generally with 6-10 flagella, and nonmotile cells, with no flagella. In this paper, we use mathematical models of the gene network that regulates flagellar construction to explore how the bacteria controls the number of flagella produced. We suggest that a bacterium must accumulate a threshold amount of a master regulator protein to initiate flagella production and failure to reach the threshold results in no flagella. Downstream mechanisms that impact the amount of master regulator protein are sufficient to determine how many flagella are produced.",

    "abstract": "Migration of populations from their founder population is expected to cause a reduction in genetic diversity and facilitates population differentiation between the populations and their founder population as predicted by the theory of genetic isolation by distance. Consistent with that, a model of expansion from a single founder predicts that patterns of genetic diversity in populations can be well explained by their geographic expansion from the founders, which is correlated to the genetic differentiation. To investigate this in the chicken, we have estimated the relationship between the genetic diversity in 172 domesticated chicken populations and their genetic distances to wild populations. We have found a strong inverse relationship whereby 87.5% of the variation in the overall genetic diversity of domesticated chicken can be explained by the genetic distance to the wild populations. We also investigated if different types of SNPs and genes present similar patterns of genetic diversity as the overall genome. Among different SNP classes, the non-synonymous ones were the most deviating from the overall genome. However, the genetic distances to wild populations still explained more variation in domesticated chicken diversity in all SNP classes ranging from 81.7 to 88.7%. The genetic diversity seemed to change at a faster rate within the chicken in genes that are associated with transmembrane transport, protein transport and protein metabolic processes, and lipid metabolic processes. In general, such genes are flexible to be manipulated according to the population needs. On the other hand, genes which the genetic diversity hardly changes despite the genetic distance to the wild populations are associated with major functions e.g. brain development. Therefore, changes in the genes may be detrimental to the chickens. These results contribute to the knowledge of different evolutionary patterns of different functional genomic regions in the chicken.\n\nAuthor summaryThe chicken was first domesticated about 6000 B.C. in Asia from the jungle fowl. Following domestication, chickens were taken to different parts of the world mainly by humans. Evolutionary forces such as selection and genetic drift have shaped diversification within the chicken species. In addition, new breeds or strains have been developed from crossbreeding programs facilitated by man. These events, together with other breeding practices, have led to genomic alterations causing genetic differentiation between the domesticated chickens and their ancestral/wild population as well as manipulation of the genetic diversity within the domesticated chickens. We investigated the relationship between 172 domesticated chicken populations from different selection, breeding and management backgrounds and their genetic distance to the wild type chickens. We found that the genetic diversity within the populations decreases with the increasing genetic distances to the wild types. Human manipulation of chicken genetic diversity has more effect on the genetic differentiation than simple geographic separations (through migrations) do. We further found that some genes associated with vital functions show evolutionary constraints or persistent selection across the populations and do not comply with this relationship i.e. the genetic diversity within the populations is constant despite the change in the genetic distance to the wild types.",

    "abstract": "The present study examines how artificial tactile stimulation from a novel non-invasive sensory device is learned and integrated with information from another sensory system. Participants were trained to identify the direction of visual dot motion stimuli with a low, medium, and high signal-to-noise ratio. In bimodal trials, this visual direction information was paired with reliable symbolic tactile information. Over several training blocks, discrimination performance in unimodal tactile test trials and subjects confidence in their decision improved, indicating that participants were able to associate the visual and tactile information consciously and thus learned the meaning of the symbolic tactile cues. Formal analysis of the results in bimodal trials showed that both modalities are being integrated already in the early learning phases. Our modeling results revealed that this integration is consistent with a Bayesian model, which is an optimal integration of sensory information. Furthermore, we showed that a confidence-based Bayesian integration explains the observed behavioral data better than the classical variance-based Bayesian integration. Thus, the present study demonstrates that humans can consciously learn and integrate an artificial sensory device that delivers symbolic tactile information. This finding connects the field of multisensory integration research to the development of sensory substitution systems.",

We sought to explore the preclinical data that differentiated successful from failed therapeutic agents in lung cancer.\n\nMethods134 failed lung cancer drugs and 27 successful lung cancer drugs were identified. Preclinical data were evaluated. The outcome variable for cell model experiments was the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), and for murine model experiments was tumor growth inhibition (TGI). A logistic regression was performed on quartiles (Q) of IC50s and TGIs.\n\nResultsWe compared odds of approval among drugs defined by IC50 and TGI quartile. Compared to drugs with preclinical cell experiments in highest IC50 quartile (Q4, IC50 345.01-100,000nM), those in Q3 differed little, but those in the lower two quartiles had better odds of being approved. However, there was no significant monotonic trend identified (P-trend 0.4). For preclinical murine models, TGI values ranged from -0.3119 to 1.0000, with a tendency for approved drugs to demonstrate poorer inhibition than failed drugs. Analyses comparing success of drugs according to TGI quartile produced interval estimates too wide to be statistically meaningful, although all point estimates accord with drugs in Q2-Q4 (TGI 0.5576-0.7600, 0.7601-0.9364, 0.9365-1.0000) having lower odds of success than those in Q1 (-0.3119-0.5575).\n\nConclusionThere does not appear to be a significant linear trend between preclinical success and drug approval, and therefore published preclinical data does not predict success of therapeutics in lung cancer. Newer models with predictive power would be beneficial to drug development efforts.",

Using geometric morphometry analysis, Aedes aegypti wing size and shape variation of males and females was studied in four altitudes in the second-smallest department in Colombia: 1.200 m (Tebaida), 1.400 m (Armenia), 1.500 m (Calarca), and 1.700 m (Filandia). Wing shape in males (P < 0.001) and females (P < 0.001) was significantly different through the altitudinal gradient; in turn, wing size in males followed the altitudinal gradient (Males R2 = 0.04946, P = 0.0002), Females (R2 = 0.0011, P = 0.46). Wing allometry for males (P < 0.001) and females (P < 0.001) was significant. Likewise, the shape and size of the wings of males (P < 0.001) and females (P < 0.001) had significant fluctuating asymmetry. It is concluded that, in a small scale with an altitudinal variation of 500 meters, it is detected that the size and shape of the wings varied in A. aegypti, principal vector of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. The fluctuating asymmetry is present in the individuals studied and could be associated with environmental effects caused by vector control campaigns present in some sampling locations.",

Therefore, we examined the potential of HBV vaccines based on mouse CMV (MCMV) vectors expressing the small HBsAg. Immunological consequences of vaccine virus attenuation were addressed by either replacing the dispensable gene m157 ( MCMV-HBs) or the gene M27 ( {Delta}M27-HBs), the latter encodes a potent interferon antagonist targeting the transcription factor STAT2. M27 was chosen, since human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encodes an analogous gene product, which also induced proteasomal STAT2 degradation by exploiting Cullin RING ubiquitin ligases. Vaccinated mice were challenged with HBV through hydrodynamic injection. MCMV-HBs and {Delta}M27-HBs vaccination achieved accelerated HBV clearance in serum and liver as well as robust HBV-specific CD8+ T cell responses. When we explored the therapeutic potential of MCMV-based vaccines, especially the combination of {Delta}M27-HBs prime and DNA boost vaccination resulted in increased intrahepatic HBs-specific CD8+ T cell responses and HBV clearance in persistently infected mice. Our results demonstrated that vaccines based on a replication competent MCMV attenuated through the deletion of an interferon antagonist targeting STAT2 elicit robust anti-HBV immune responses and mediate HBV clearance in mice in prophylactic and therapeutic immunization regimes.",

The purpose of this work was to develop a low cost and easy to implement classification model which distinguishes low grade gliomas (LGGs) from high grade gliomas (HGGs), through texture analysis applied to conventional brain MRI. Different combinations between MRI contrasts (T1Gd and T2) and one segmented glioma region (necrotic and non-enhancing tumor core (NCR/NET)) were studied. Texture features obtained from the Gray Level Size Zone Matrix (GLSZM) were calculated. An under-samplig method was proposed to divide the data into different training subsets and subsequently extract complementary information for the creation of distinct classification models. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the models were calculated. The best model was explicitly reported. The best model included only three texture features and reached a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 94.12%, 88.24% and 91.18% respectively. According to the features of the model, when the NCR/NET region was studied, HGGs had a more heterogeneous texture than LGGs in the T1Gd images and LGGs had a more heterogeneous texture than HGGs in the T2 images. These novel results partially contrast with results from literature. The best model proved to be useful for the classification of gliomas. Complementary results showed that heterogeneity of gliomas depended on the studied MRI contrast. The model presented stands out as a simple, low cost, easy to implement, reproducible and highly accurate glioma classifier. What is more important, it should be accessible to populations with reduced economic and scientific resources.",

    "abstract": "Parental care elevates reproductive success by allocating resources into the upbringing of the offspring. However, it also imposes strong costs for the care giving parent and can foster sexual dimorphism. Trade-offs between the reproductive system and the immune system may result in differential immunological capacities between the care-providing and the non-care-providing parent. Usually, providing care is restricted to the female sex making it impossible to study a sex-independent influence of parental investment on sexual immune dimorphism. The decoupling of sex-dependent parental investment and their influences on the parental immunological capacity, however, is possible in syngnathids, which evolved the unique male pregnancy on a gradient ranging from a simple carrying of eggs on the trunk (Nerophinae, low paternal investment) to full internal pregnancy (Syngnathus, high paternal investment). In this study, we compared candidate gene expression between females and males of different gravity stages in three species of syngnathids (Syngnathus typhle, Syngnathus rostellatus and Nerophis ophidion) with different male pregnancy intensities to determine how parental investment influences sexual immune dimorphism. While our data failed to detect sexual immune dimorphism in the subset of candidate genes assessed, we show a parental care specific resource-allocation trade-off between investment into pregnancy and immune defense when parental care is provided.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEmerging evidence has demonstrated that WISP2/CCN5 is critically involved in tumorigenesis. However, the function of WISP2/CCN5 in breast cancer carcinogenesis is largely unclear.\n\nMethodswe aim to explore the effects and potential mechanisms of WISP2/CCN5 on proliferation of breast cancer cells and carcinogenesis of breast cancer xenograft. Lentivirus vector with WISP2/CCN5shRNA was transfected into MCF-7, and breast cancer cells and xenograft were conducted. Effect of WISP2/CCN5 on growth and carcinogenesis of breast cancer cells and xenografts was evaluated by MTT assay and tumor volume. The relationship between WISP2/CCN5, Skp2 and p27Kip1 was detected in vitro and in vivo by RT-PCR at mRNA level and Western blotting at protein level.\n\nResultsThe result of MTT assay indicated that MCF-7 cell growth viability in WISP2/CCN5 gene knockdown group was significantly higher than negative vector group(P<0.05) or control group (P<0.05). It suggested that knockdown of WISP2/CCN5 gene by shRNA lentivirus plasmid promoted proliferation of MCF-7 cells. The growth curves of breast cancer xenograft showed that xenografts in WISP2/CCN5 knockdown group grew more quickly than negative vector group(P< 0.05) or control group (P< 0.05). Subsequently, the results of RT-PCR and Western blotting revealed that WISP2/CCN5 gene knockdown led to increased Skp2 and decreased p27Kip1 at mRNA and protein levels. WISP2/CCN5 exerts its inhibition on proliferation of MCF-7 cell line and suppressive functions on growth of breast carcinoma via regulation of Skp2 and p27Kip1at mRNA and protein levels. However, WISP2/CCN5 gene knockdown resulted in loss of inhibition effect on MCF-7 and breast cancer.\n\nConclusionsOur findings suggest that WISP2/CCN5 could be a useful therapeutic strategy for the treatment of breast cancer through targeting Skp2 and p27Kip1.",
